TOMMY TUCKER; MELLOW LEADER IN BIG BAND ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tommy Tucker, whose long-ago recording of "I Don't Want to Set the World on 
Fire" turned his musicians from an ordinary $500-a-week band into a major, if 
temporary, presence during the Big Band Era, died Tuesday of heart failure in a 
Sarasota, Fla., hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, 86, retired to Florida many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A short, quiet-spoken man in an age of flamboyant leaders, Tucker was probably 
the only band leader of any time to boast a Phi Beta Kappa key (from the 
University of North Dakota). 
</P>
<P>
His band was known for its sweet sounds and capable singers and was playing the 
hotels and cafes of the day. But Tucker was still looking for a hit record in 
the summer of 1940 when he was performing at the Hotel Berkeley-Carterer in 
Asbury Park, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
With his wife and female singer, Amy Arnell, they visited a club in nearby 
Philadelphia where a group called the Three Keys was singing "I Don't Want to 
Set the World on Fire." 
</P>
<P>
It was not a new song and had been recorded earlier but at a faster pace. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's new, moderately paced version with Arnell on the vocal sold more than 
500,000 records. 
</P>
<P>
Other well-known Tucker songs were the band's theme, "I Love You (Oh, How I 
Love You)," sung by a trio, and "The Man That Comes Around." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who played the piano, trumpet and trombone, was also familiar to radio 
fans for such shows as "Sing for Your Supper With Tommy Tucker," "Thirty 
Minutes in Hollywood" and "Hit Parade." And he made numerous television 
appearances on "The Kate Smith Show," "Cavalcade of Bands," "Arthur Murray 
House Party" and "Strike It Rich." 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1940s Tucker tried to add luster to his quiet arrangements, but he 
had been so long associated with a mellow sound that audiences did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
He eventually gave up the band, returned to academia as a professor of fine 
arts at Monmouth College in New Jersey and then retired to Florida.

DONALD S. VOORHEES; JUDGE WHO RULED ON WWII INTERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald S. Voorhees, 72, the federal district judge who in 1986 ruled that the 
U.S. government 42 years earlier had improperly concealed evidence from the 
courts as to whether there was a military necessity of moving 
Japanese-Americans from their homes in the Western states to internment camps. 
Voorhees' ruling overturned the conviction of Gordon K. Hirabayashi, who had 
fought relocation. Voorhees' decision came soon after Congress decided to give 
$20,000 and an apology to each Japanese-American who been forced into the 
camps, although the money has yet to be appropriated. Voorhees also figured in 
a major school desegregation case in 1979 when he overturned an anti-busing 
initiative approved by voters in the state of Washington. His ruling, upheld by 
the U.S. Supreme Court, allowed the Seattle school district to carry out its 
desegregation plan. In Seattle on July 7 after surgery for a brain tumor.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CAMP PENDLETON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marines at Camp Pendleton spent most of Friday mopping up after a fire that 
burned about 2,000 acres before it was contained late Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 firefighters from Camp Pendleton, Carlsbad, Oceanside, Encinitas, 
Vista and Fallbrook battled the blaze that began at 11:56 a.m. Thursday on one 
of the base's firing ranges. Tracer rounds fired on the range caused the fire, 
said Cpl. Lorna Shryock. 
</P>
<P>
Several firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation and eye irritation, and 
one firefighter was cut on his wrist, but no major injuries occurred, Shryock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused no damage to nearby structures or power and telephone lines, 
but there was minor damage to some contractor equipment, including a pallet of 
PCB pipes, Shryock said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are still assessing the damage.

AL MARTINEZ: BEETS, TUNA AND CAULIFLOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iwas sitting down to a dinner of one cup each of tuna, beets and cauliflower 
the other day when it occurred to me that I don't like tuna, beets or 
cauliflower. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't eat this," I said to my wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Eat it or die," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't mean it as a threat but as a warning. If I didn't control my weight 
and my cholesterol, I would not make it past Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
Only once in three decades of journalism have I known of a woman who has killed 
her mate for not eating. It happened in Van Nuys. She said, "Eat your green 
beans." He said, "Go to hell," and she shot him. 
</P>
<P>
He should have eaten his green beans, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
"I can take the tuna," I said, "and I can force down the cauliflower, but man 
was not meant to eat beets. I've never even known anyone who eats beets. Have 
you ever seen a person actually chew and swallow a beet?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what you do with half of them," she said. "Feed them to the dog, 
rub them in your hair or dance naked around them. But eat the other half!" 
</P>
<P>
I didn't like the look in her eyes, so I ate them all and skipped the naked 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
Beets, you see, are part of a new, three-day "Kaiser Permanente Diet" sweeping 
L.A. People all over town have copies and rave about its effect. 
</P>
<P>
A friend named Joe has lost 40 pounds. His wife has lost 30. They look 
terrific, feel great and have seen their cholesterol levels plummet overnight 
to the standard of an Olympic distance runner. 
</P>
<P>
I hate to have to tell them the whole thing's a fake. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser disclaims the diet and says it could cause ketosis, which leads to 
internal rotting, kidney failure and death. 
</P>
<P>
But if you still think it's worth the weight loss, bon apetit! 
</P>
<P>
I am one of 60 million Americans with high cholesterol and one of 34 million 
who are overweight. I eat fish, avoid eggs and am acutely aware of my complex 
carbohydrates. Still, my cholesterol stays high. 
</P>
<P>
When I ask my doctor what to do, he says, "Eat less." He is not a man of many 
words and coughs often. I suspect he smokes. 
</P>
<P>
"Is 'eat less' the extent of your medical advice?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
"Yep," he says, coughing. 
</P>
<P>
Then I heard about the ersatz Kaiser Diet from Joe, who willingly furnished me 
with a copy. The idea is to diet for three out of every seven days. 
</P>
<P>
"This will change your life," he said enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
He had the same kind of light in his eyes that Scientologists get when they 
talk about L. Ron Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
A typical breakfast under the Fake Kaiser Diet consists of one hard-boiled egg. 
A typical lunch is one cup of cottage cheese and three crackers. You already 
know about dinner. 
</P>
<P>
It's a simple diet. No Pritikin-type food exchanges or frozen Nutri-System 
platters. You eat what they say but only what they say. Americans love the idea 
of following orders. That's why Ollie North is a national hero. 
</P>
<P>
Ollie, we know, would eat at least half his beets. And shred the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know where the diet came from or who put it out," Kaiser spokesman 
Allan Mann said. "Those things originate in places like Cleveland and spread 
across the country." 
</P>
<P>
Tracing the origin of the diet, Mann suggested, would be like tracing the 
origin of a dirty joke. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those urban myths that just get started," he said, "like the story 
of the woman who microwaved her dog." 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to ask if microwaving a dog was part of another fake diet attributed 
to Kaiser, but by then Mann was discussing an earlier rumor circulated under 
the hospital's name. 
</P>
<P>
A "bulletin" once falsely warned that a batch of cartoon transfers that 
children licked and plastered on their skin had been laced with LSD. The media 
reported it as fact and panic ensued. It gave childhood fantasies a whole new 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
The best diet, Mann said, is the one distributed by the American Heart Assn. 
that doesn't require you to OD on beets. 
</P>
<P>
He did finally admit, however, that three days of dieting off and on probably 
wouldn't cause ketosis. Kaiser just doesn't believe it's generally healthy. 
</P>
<P>
But as long as death by way of internal rotting isn't a problem, I'm going to 
stick to it for a while. I've lost six pounds already and there is a lot to be 
said for being able to button my jacket for the first time since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
I'm making only one minor variation in the diet. I lied to my wife and said 
Mann had suggested we skip the beets, they cause pimples. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure she believed me, but she has switched from beets to green beans. 
Remembering the husband in Van Nuys, I'm going to let it go at that.

ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS 
</P>

<P>
By STEVE HARVEY, From staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe it was the heat, together with the fact that the weekend was approaching. 
But downtown L.A. seemed a bit stranger than usual Friday. 
</P>
<P>
First there was the noontime chase on foot through Little Tokyo, featuring one 
man pursued by (in order) a couple of restaurant workers, a group of about 20 
high school kids and two Los Angeles policeman. 
</P>
<P>
The workers and the kids eventually gave up. Police, who had joined the 
excitement late, questioned them and resumed the search. The suspect was later 
caught and arrested on suspicion of theft, though further details were not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
The school kids admitted they hadn't been much help in answering the cops' 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
As one student told a Times reporter: "We didn't know what happened. We just 
saw someone being chased so we went after him, too." 
</P>
<P>
A bit earlier, an eccentric basketball player was seen playing against 
imaginary opponents on the corner of Spring and 2nd streets, frightening 
passers-by as he pretended to toss his ball into their midsections. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-ish hoopster, alternately dribbling and pantomiming shots, eventually 
ran a solitary fast-break east on 2nd Street, perhaps headed for New York's 
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police were writing tickets to drivers who clogged the intersection 
at 9th and Figueroa streets. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem, observeJ. O'Connor, a waiter at the nearby Pantry Cafe, was 
that authorities had blocked off one of the lanes on 9th and were directing 
alleged violators into that area, where the tickets were written. 
</P>
<P>
And a second lane was blocked off by an electronic arrow directing drivers to 
avoid the blocked-off portions. 
</P>
<P>
The end result: A tremendous case of gridlock on both Figueroa and 9th. 
</P>
<P>
Donations to the homeless during the holiday season are fine, said Marian 
Thomas of Digital Equipment Co., "but we didn't want them to think they were 
forgotten the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
So 90 Digital employees donated bonus checks that they'd saved from last 
Christmas to the Los Angeles Mission Friday. Digital's management chipped in, 
too. And the mission wound up with $2,437 from the Christmas-in-July offering 
to buy food. 
</P>
<P>
The Skating Musician performing indoors? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, turbaned Harry Perry will be at Santa Monica's Church in Ocean Park 
tonight along with such fellow Venice performers as Tom (The Skating Clown) 
Boyle and pianist Barry Gordon (whose piano is, of course, on wheels). 
</P>
<P>
It's a noisy fund-raiser for the anti-nukers, the Alliance for Survival. The 
show starts rolling at 8 p.m.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven men and two women were arrested Thursday night in Ocean Beach during 
unrelated drug busts by undercover detectives of the San Diego Police 
Department's narcotics division. 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics detectives purchased undisclosed quantities of marijuana, 
amphetamines and LSD from local residents and transients in a four-hour 
operation called the "Buy Bust," police spokesman Bill Robinson said. The busts 
took place in the 5000 block of Newport Avenue, the 5000 block of Narragansett 
and the 5100 block of West Point Loma Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects had his two children in tow when he sold drugs to an 
undercover detective, Robinson said. The children were taken to Hillcrest 
Receiving Home. 
</P>
<P>
The thirteen suspects were booked into County Jail on suspicion of felony 
possession of narcotics and possession of narcotics for sale.

Hollywood Park race track in Inglewood have one too. It's a little bigger than 
the ones found in most back yards -- 14 feet deep and about 75 feet across -- 
and it features an entrance ramp because horses aren't too agile on steps or

DEPUTY'S '83 COKE BUST REAPS POT OF GOLD IN '89

When Sheriff's Deputy Billy Guinn arrested Clive Thomas with 7 pounds of 
cocaine in February, 1983, he could not have known it would come to this. 
</P>
<P>
But, after six years, 18 arrests and a nationwide treasure hunt, that drug bust 
earned a real dividend Friday for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department -- 
a $246,000 check from the federal government for help in cracking a major 
cocaine ring. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' arrest opened a six-year federal investigation of businessman William 
Musson that reached from Hawaii to Ohio and netted $30 million in drug profits, 
said Charles Hill, Drug Enforcement Agency special agent-in-charge. Hill joined 
U. S. Atty. William Braniff and Chief Deputy Marshal Robert Dighera in 
presenting the check to Sheriff John Duffy at a news conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the money is the first installment of the $800,000 the Sheriff's 
Department expects to earn from the sale of the gold coins and bullion 
surrendered by Musson in a plea-bargain agreement with federal prosecutors, 
Duffy said. A small part of the check is for help on other cases. Under the 
Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the Justice Department shares drug 
profits seized from traffickers with assisting local police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enormous Resources' 
</P>
<P>
"The drug lords are not constrained by budget deficits or Proposition 13 and 
have enormous resources at their disposal," Braniff said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal payments directly to his department are used to buy computers and other 
high-tech equipment, according to Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
The Musson case led federal agents from the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement 
Task Force in Denver to a remote Nebraska ranch, a Hawaii mountaintop and a 
Colorado crevice in search of the $4.5 million in gold buried by the drug ring, 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
But he credited San Diego sheriff's deputies with helping the investigation get 
that far.

ART RIG; 
</P>
<P>
STUDENTS EXERCISE CREATIVE BENT IN 48-FOOT-LONG MOBILE STUDIO

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Museum of Art rolled out a new, brightly painted educational tool 
Friday morning, a 48-foot-long semi-trailer, dubbed "Art Rig." 
</P>
<P>
The big rig, which will visit 107 San Diego city schools over the next two 
years, was parked in front of the museum next to tented hands-on art exhibits 
for children. The "Art Rig" is the latest element of an innovative, 
$3.75-million arts education program funded by philanthropist Muriel Gluck. 
</P>
<P>
"Last fall we planted a garden called 'Young at 'Art,' and now we see it 
flowering," Gluck said at a news conference. While hoping that the educational 
program would "open the minds of the children," Gluck also praised the San 
Diego Unified School District for its role in putting 60 artists-in-residence, 
whom she funded, into elementary classrooms during the past school year. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, Gluck announced a $3.75-million gift, to be divided between the 
school district and the museum over a three-to-five-year period. The innovative 
donation was designed to create a new arts education program by linking 
practicing artists, the arts teaching resources of the school district and the 
museum with young children. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Payzant, school district superintendent, presented Gluck a photo album of 
the program's accomplishments in the schools to date, saying much has been 
realized since a year ago "when we were talking about . . . an idea." 
</P>
<P>
Museum of Art Director Steven Brezzo praised Gluck for the work she has already 
done and "of the great potential about to be realized through the program," 
before surprising her with personal vanity license plates spelling "Art Rig." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of buying and outfitting the "Art Rig" was more than $100,000, Brezzo 
said. The trailer's 360 square feet of hands-on demonstration exhibits were 
soon tested as scores of students from four elementary schools invaded the 
air-conditioned space, where they were guided by intern docents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Texture, Shape, Color 
</P>
<P>
At one end of the trailer the children swarmed around separate displays on the 
different elements of art: texture, shape, color and space. In the other end, 
they made art. 
</P>
<P>
In the texture exhibit, students turned a crank to move different materials 
through a cut-out in a replication of Dubuffet's "Bonne mine," which is in the 
museum's permanent collection. The kids put their hands up to feel the 
different textures of fur, brushed aluminum, tree bark, weathered and smooth 
lumber. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end, they were told to imagine they were a scuba diver, an 
astronaut, city planner or interior designer. As scuba divers, the students 
envisioned themselves at the bottom of the ocean, then were instructed to "make 
a painting of it" by sticking painted foam shapes with magnets on a section of 
the wall. They charged across the trailer to boxes of shapes like settlers in 
the Oklahoma Land Rush. 
</P>
<P>
On leaving the trailer, Elacio Martinez, a fifth-grader from Balboa Elementary 
said, "I liked it. I liked the part where you can build everything in your 
imagination. Like when you close your eyes, it's like it really happens."

scheduled to visit 107 schools over the next two years. STAN HONDA

BREAST-FEEDING IN RESTAURANTS

<P>
While students in China are facing machine guns in the name of liberty and the 
Supreme Court in Washington is deciding questions of, literally, life, death 
and the American flag, our own defender of the Constitution, Gloria Allred, is 
prosecuting a civil rights case on behalf of a woman who did not want to be 
told by a restaurant that she would have to breast-feed her child discreetly or 
in the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
After fighting this case for five years, and losing, Allred naturally held a 
press conference to announce another appeal. Perhaps if the press stopped 
covering her nonsense she would go away.

<P>
I am appalled at Judge Richard Wells' decision in favor of Cafe Rodeo's policy 
against allowing women to breast-feed their infants at their tables ("Judge 
Rules for Cafe in Suit Over Breast-Feeding," Metro, June 30). 
</P>
<P>
There is something fundamentally wrong with a society which allows smoking in 
public, which medical experts agree can only be harmful to everyone involved 
(the smoker and all those nearby), but does not allow breast-feeding in public, 
which medical experts agree can only be beneficial to everyone involved (the 
mother and child). 
</P>
<P>
People who feel squeamish about the sight of a woman discreetly nourishing her 
child in the most healthful, natural and loving manner possible should remember 
that throughout history, women have nursed their children, and it is only in a 
rare society that breast-feeding is not openly accepted. Most of the people who 
object to the sight of nursing were probably themselves nursed as infants; up 
until a few decades ago almost all children were breast-fed. Virtually all of 
the great philosophers, prophets, religious leaders, military rulers, 
scientists and regents through the ages were breast-fed as babies. Why should 
we stop utilizing this wonderful and natural means of nourishment -- after all, 
why do women have breasts?

NORTH'S SENTENCE IN IRAN-CONTRA FIASCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North gets off with a slap on the wrist. That man did more to desecrate our 
flag and make a mockery of what America stands for than could a platoon of 
flag-burning arsonists. He violated the very basis of our democratic society in 
the name of patriotism. His actions were either very misguided, or very 
hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell's actions are understandable, if a bit parochial. I don't consider North 
to be a violent criminal, but his crimes were indeed crimes of violence -- 
violence to the people of Central America, violence to people around the 
Persian Gulf, violence to democratic adherents in every country. 
</P>
<P>
The United States does try to show that democracy is the best form of 
government that imperfect man has yet devised. Unfortunately, North threw a 
great big monkey wrench into the works, and our ability to set a good example 
has suffered greatly.

NORTH'S SENTENCE IN IRAN-CONTRA FIASCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been following the Iran-Contra trial closely since its inception and now 
as it comes to a close, my predominant feeling is one of deep mistrust of those 
who run our country. The judicial system has failed, as well, in engendering 
confidence in the public. U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell admits that Oliver 
North was acting only as "a low-ranking subordinate . . . (to) a few cynical 
superiors" (Part I, July 6). The court did not have the nerve to name those 
superiors and could not muster the power to bring them to the stand. 
</P>
<P>
I am a public schoolteacher and must seriously consider how I will present this 
part of our history to my students. I will name those superiors who 
intentionally violated the Boland Amendment and international law, lied to the 
press, Congress and the public, contradicted their own stated policy towards 
Iran, and worse, were responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent 
Nicaraguans: former President Reagan and President Bush.

CATHOLIC BISHOPS PROHIBIT MASS FOR GAY, LESBIAN ORGANIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision made by Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony and the 12 other 
bishops from Southern and Central California prohibiting priests from 
celebrating Mass for the gay Catholic Dignity organization is just another 
abomination of the church's attitude towards those who the church doesn't want 
in its service ("Catholic Bishops Prohibit Masses for Gay, Lesbian Group," Part 
I, June 23). 
</P>
<P>
As a fallen Catholic I have looked towards the church for years to reinstate 
itself with me, and yet it continually abandons those who need and want it the 
most. Mahony and his bishops have now fallen into that category of the 
far-right fundamentalists who cannot abide the behavior of others who do not 
act like them. In view of this recent decision, it seems the church still 
groups "whores, murderers and homosexuals" together. 
</P>
<P>
With Christ's basic teachings of "Do unto others as you would have them do unto 
you" and those of compassion and forgiveness, the church has blasphemed his 
teachings with this backward decision. 
</P>
<P>
Personal saving grace is attained by knowing that God is in each one of us, and 
being comfortable with that knowledge and working with it for the betterment of 
all. Remember, "My house has many rooms." Unfortunately, the Catholic Church 
seems to have gotten elitist in its tenants, and one more time, there is no 
room at the inn.

NORTH'S SENTENCE IN IRAN-CONTRA FIASCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a simple Iranian who emigrated to this country and became an American 
citizen, I find President Bush confused, Judge Gesell confused, and I myself 
confused along with many others on the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
The President seems confused as he damns the protective wrapping of Gregory 
Johnson in the Constitution for desecrating the flag, while he pronounces North 
a hero for wrapping himself in the flag and desecrating the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
By intending to "avoid hardening the lieutenant colonel's conviction by not 
sending him to jail," Gesell has unknowingly opened the doors for potential 
thieves, crooks and liars in positions of power in the government to commit 
similar acts confident of judicial leniency. Gesell is seemingly confused as he 
neglected the importance of deterrence. 
</P>
<P>
This former Marine, on behalf of a small group, proudly sold armaments at an 
inflated price to a group of lunatics in Iran for killing innocent people. He 
took the profit and gave it to another group of warriors in another part of 
world for killing purposes again. Hardly a single word was said about this 
central moral issue in a country where human rights, human dignity and human 
lives are highly revered. Shouldn't I be confused? 
</P>
<P>
I always considered a hero an individual who has great strength, courage, 
nobility and extraordinary positive achievements: an ideal or model. Those who 
bestow heroism for lying, cheating or committing immoral acts are either 
confused or are redefining the word.

The real tragedy of the North trial was once again the truth has eluded the 
American people. Unfortunately, both Bush and Reagan were able to cloak their 
involvement in the Iran-Contra affair by pleading "national security" during 
the North trial. 
</P>
<P>
I can only hope that the judges who preside at the John Poindexter and Richard 
Secord trials will have more judicial backbone than Gesell. If citizen Reagan 
is subpoenaed to testify, order him to take the stand or be held in contempt of 
court like any other American. Perhaps then all the Iran-Contra scoundrels can 
enjoy a "Dutch treat" and the American people may learn the truth.

My advice to Nicole Kaufman: When next you feel the urge to "do lunch with the

around chit-chatting while you do your mother-child bonding in the presence of 
those who apparently wouldn't object.

Finally, is it really in the best interest of babies, with their delicate 
immune system, to subject them to the coughs, sneezes, odors, etc., that we 
adults can more readily handle?

COURT DECISION REINSTATING LIBRARY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Friends of the Library of Monterey Park are justifiably elated with the 
state Court of Appeal's decision to reinstate the Board of Library Trustees 
which was abolished by the Monterey Park City Council in violation of the state 
Education Code (Metro, June 28). This is not only a victory for the Friends and 
the people of Monterey Park with its tradition dating back to 1929 of a 
management board, but a precedential case as well. There has never before been 
a California court ruling for libraries to be overseen by an independent board 
and that city officials cannot legally disband the board. This decision affects 
libraries throughout the state of California and is also of nationwide 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
Having been forewarned by the Friends and many other concerned residents, the 
majority of the council, the late Cam Briglio, Pat Reichenberger and Barry 
Hatch, voted to abolish the board in violation of the state Education Code. 
While they considered the funding requirements of the Library Municipal Act 
"archaic," the facts are that council members exercise final budget approval 
and they even have the much coveted line-item veto. How much more control does 
the council need? So all we can conclude is that they wanted absolute control 
and such control from a political body politicizes the library to the detriment 
of the community. Even George Washington feared the absolute control of kings! 
</P>
<P>
We acknowledge and thank the Asian Pacific Legal Center for filing the suit and 
representing us so successfully in Superior Court. Following that court 
decision, the Friends again urged the city council to reinstate the board and 
to not appeal, but council members Hatch, Reichenberger, Chris Houseman and 
Betty Couch voted to appeal, incurring legal expenses which ultimately totaled 
$40,000 at a time when the city faced a $1.2 million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, our gratitude to the attorneys for O'Melveny and Myers, the 
People for the American Way and state superintendent of schools, Bill Honig, 
for their participation and efforts on our behalf. We believe the council has 
wisely chosen not to appeal to the state Supreme Court and now it is time for 
the Board of Library Trustees to resume its responsibilities in managing the 
library and for the Friends to return to its primary focus of supporting the 
library and its programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends are committed to preserving the library as a center to supplement 
the formal system of free public education and as a source of information and 
inspiration to persons of all ages, cultural backgrounds and economic status.

SMALLER EVENT DRAWS FAMILIES TO NEW SITE

<P>
Sure, the San Fernando Valley Fair has fewer rides this year. And maybe some 
people did get a little lost and go to where the fair used to be, in 
Northridge, and not where it is now, at the Hansen Dam Sports Complex. 
</P>
<P>
But where else could you go to see pig races, pet baby calves and a llama, or 
ride an authentic covered wagon? 
</P>
<P>
"I like the livestock," said Dreena Marcos, 12, who came to the fair Friday 
with a group of 60 youths from a Sun Valley recreation center. "It's 
interesting to look at them, except that they smell because, well, you know . . 
. nature calls." 
</P>
<P>
Fair organizers said the three-day event would be a "classic old-time country 
fair." 
</P>
<P>
The fair was ousted last year from Cal State Northridge, its home for 13 years, 
to make room for campus expansion. Gone from this year's fair were carnival 
rides for adults and alcoholic beverages. That brought fewer teen-agers but 
more parents with small children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nice 'Cause It's Smaller' 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice 'cause it's smaller," Kathy White of Sylmar said as she watched her 
best friend's daughter Melissa, 4, ride the merry-go-round. "It's not like 
Pomona where you have to fight the crowds." 
</P>
<P>
By far the largest audience of the day gathered to watch five 100-pound 
Yorkshire pigs race around an oval sawdust track. "We're not in the business of 
raising fat pigs," pig trainer Jerry Conklin told the crowd of about 200 
people. "We're in the business of raising slim, trim and fast pigs." 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic contest, the five porkers bolted from a small steel gate, 
reaching the finish line almost in a dead heat. Cool Ham Luke was declared the 
winner by a snout over Barbara Q and Bunny Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
Those exhausted by the excitement of the races could take a ride on the covered 
wagon that circled the 35-acre fairground. "It's our own private little RTD," 
fair administrator Ted Nauman said. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the country flavor was the small shack where blacksmith Ted Salyers 
plied his trade before a dozen curious onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think the art is gone," the blacksmith said. "But it's not." 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, Salyers took a 1/4-inch steel rod from a bed of coals with 
a pair of firetongs. Using a hammer, chisel and anvil, in five minutes he 
transformed the red-hot rod into the face of a wizard. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanna be a blacksmith," said Tania, 5. 
</P>
<P>
Her friend Danielle wasn't as impressed. "You want to be anything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a such a nice day at the fair -- sunny but not too warm -- that even 
some of the performers mingled with the crowd, enjoying the rides and exhibits. 
After finishing her first Polynesian dance show, Kalena Erickson took a break 
with her 5-year-old godson, Timmy, and visited the Great American Petting Zoo, 
a small barn where children mingled with fawns, chickens and goats. 
</P>
<P>
"They're kind of ferocious," Timmy commented as he watched a goat fight his 
godmother for animal food from a vending machine. Indeed, the same goat soon 
went after Erickson's lei. 
</P>
<P>
"He got a flower!" Erickson yelled as she wrestled the goat for control of the 
necklace. "And it's not a real flower either." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Late Start 
</P>
<P>
Not all went smoothly during the fair's first day. Down the hill from the 
petting zoo, a rock group played "Jailhouse Rock" before a group of eight 
spectators. Sound technician John Holmes said the concert got started late 
because of some confusion among the band members. "They were lost," Holmes 
said. "They went to Northridge first before coming here." 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Kregear of Sylmar danced to the music for a while before taking her 
son, Vincent, 5, back to the rides and livestock exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the inexpensive jewelry and the crafts," she said. "It's not like the 
stuff you find in the malls. But mostly we're having a good time doing what he 
wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
The fair will continue today and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission is $3 
for adults and free for children 10 and under.

GRANADA HILLS COALITION OFFERS LIMITED LANDFILL EXPANSION DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fearing that the alternative could be worse, a Granada Hills residents group 
opposed to the Sunshine Canyon Landfill offered Friday to support limited 
expansion of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
The North Valley Coalition said it would endorse expansion into an unused area 
of the canyon in hopes that the proposal will head off dumping in two other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The group is concerned primarily that the growing landfill problem in Los 
Angeles will prompt the City Council next week to overturn sharp limitations on 
Sunshine Canyon dumping scheduled to go into effect next year, said the 
coalition's secretary, Mary Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition also hopes that it can persuade Browning-Ferris Industries, owner 
and operator of the landfill, to abandon plans to expand into a neighboring 
area of unincorporated Los Angeles County that the group wants purchased for a 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris plans to discuss the suggestion with the residents at a meeting 
scheduled today, said Chris Funk, an attorney for the company. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to see what they have to say in person," Funk said. He would not 
comment further. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to City Councilman Hal Bernson, who has consistently pressed for the 
dump's closure, said the residents' proposal is "very generous." 
</P>
<P>
"We would consider it if the community is signed off on it," Bernson aide Greig 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, residents would support a zoning variance to allow dumping 
on 138 acres extending west from the dump's primary mesa to the county line, 
Edwards said. Dumping could take place there until the end of 1994 under the 
group's proposal, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be a huge concession," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a City Council committee upheld a Board of Zoning Appeals decision 
requiring Dec. 31 closure of a mesa that has served as the landfill's main 
dumping area. Browning-Ferris officials have said the move would reduce the 
amount of garbage that the dump could receive by about 90%. They appealed the 
committee decision to the full council, which is scheduled to consider the 
matter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's involvement comes at a time when city sanitation officials 
are confronted with possible limits on dumping at Lopez Canyon Landfill, a dump 
above Lake View Terrace that accepts more than half the city's daily household 
trash. On Friday, the state Solid Waste Management Board imposed restrictions 
that included the landfill's height and the amount of daily trash it can 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city plans to challenge those restrictions in court Monday, Bureau 
of Sanitation officials say they may have to close Lopez Canyon within a year 
if the limits are ultimately imposed. 
</P>
<P>
The city's continuing troubles with Lopez Canyon made North Valley Coalition 
members fear that Wednesday's council decision might overturn the limits on 
Sunshine Canyon, Edwards said. "We know that the city is in a crisis 
situation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the coalition hopes that its offer will result in Browning-Ferris 
dropping its plan to expand in a northwesterly direction over the city's 
boundary and into the county, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Ryavec, a consultant to Browning-Ferris, said the planned northwestern 
expansion -- into an oak-studded canyon that residents want to see purchased as 
a park -- is ideal for a landfill because it is not near homes. 
</P>
<P>
Dropping the expansion proposal, which is being studied by the county's 
Regional Planning Department, would be foolish "with the possible closure of 
other landfills in the city," Ryavec said.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRUSH FIRE BURNS 100 ACRES NEAR NEWHALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abrush fire fanned by erratic winds charred 100 acres of Pico Canyon in 
Valencia Friday. Forty firefighters contained the blaze and kept it from 
damaging any structures, a Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Two firefighters were treated for minor injuries at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital in Valencia, spokesman Joe Silva said. One was stung by a bee, and the 
other suffered heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
The fire in the canyon west of the Golden State Freeway at Lyons Avenue was 
reported about 11:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Fire crews flying two helicopters dropped water on steep, inaccessible areas. 
Other firefighters used two bulldozers to cut firebreaks and bury minor 
outbreaks of fire. Seven engines were at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was still under investigation, Silva said.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 GANG MEMBERS FOUND GUILTY IN LAKE VIEW TERRACE 
SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After seven days of deliberations, a San Fernando Superior Court jury convicted 
two men of attempted murder in what authorities said was a gang-related 
drive-by shooting last year. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Elliot, 24, of Pacoima, and Jeffrey Evans, 24, of Lake View Terrace, 
were found guilty of firing at Cedric Finley, 20, of Pacoima in May, 1988. 
Finley, who Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison said was a member of a rival gang, 
escaped uninjured in the Lake View Terrace shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found Elliot not guilty in the murder of a Sylmar man shot to death 45 
minutes later in an unrelated incident. The victim, John Shaw, 23, was 
chaperoning a Sweet 16 party. 
</P>
<P>
Evans and another man, John Tanner, 23, of Lake View Terrace, had been 
convicted of murder in Shaw's death Wednesday by the same jury. 
</P>
<P>
During an eight-week trial, prosecutor Nison argued that Tanner and Evans 
approached Shaw as he stood with other guests in front of a house in the 14900 
block of Aztec Street in Sylmar. Evans inquired whether the party-goers were 
affiliated with a gang and Shaw, who was supervising the party, replied that he 
was not, Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
After Tanner and Evans identified themselves as gang members, Shaw responded, 
"so what," according to Nison. Tanner then fired several shots, one of which 
hit Shaw in the back. Elliot was charged in that slaying because he drove 
Tanner and Evans to the party and was present during the confrontation, Nison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing for Tanner, Evans and Elliot is set for Aug. 11. Tanner and Evans 
face a maximum sentence of life in prison. Elliot faces a maximum of 15 years.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. SUES MISSION HILLS ADULT BOOKSTORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several months of undercover investigation has led to a lawsuit against a 
Mission Hills adult bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
A suit filed Thursday by the city attorney's office in Los Angeles Superior 
Court named the Talk of the Valley Bookstore, 15452 Devonshire St., and its 
owners, Frederick Alfano and Michael H. Colella. It charged them with allowing 
lewd conduct and solicitation for lewd conduct in and near booths used by 
patrons to view pornographic films. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was started by undercover police officers in January. It led 
to 14 arrests for lewd conduct and solicitation, said Mike Qualls, a spokesman 
for the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
He said the office plans to seek a pretrial court order imposing strict rules 
on the bookstore's operation.

VAN NUYS JURY STUDIES LIABILITY; 
</P>
<P>
BLAME IN MOLESTATION WEIGHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a police matter, the facts of the case seemed clear. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-year-old boy reported that he had been with two elders from his Torrance 
church on a Sunday afternoon mission to Harbor Convalescent Hospital when a man 
he had never seen before lured him into a treatment room and sexually molested 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The boy said he will never forget his attacker -- a toothless, bearded man with 
horribly swollen legs that were covered with open sores. 
</P>
<P>
That description pointed investigators to Alfred Ray Hatch, a mentally 
disturbed patient at the hospital, who admitted that he molested the boy, 
sheriff's detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
That was more than five years ago, and authorities say the 52-year-old 
schizophrenic, who was committed to a state mental hospital for an indefinite 
period after a competency hearing, probably will never face criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
But the question of who should be held accountable for the assault has not been 
entirely resolved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Trial 
</P>
<P>
A Van Nuys Superior Court jury last week began deliberating the question of 
whether the administration and staff of Harbor Convalescent Hospital should 
share the blame for the assault. No verdict had been reached by Friday; 
deliberations will resume Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments Tuesday, lawyer Richard Farnell asked the jury to award 
more than $10 million in damages to the boy, now 12, and his mother. Farnell 
argued that the hospital was negligent because it let the boy wander unattended 
down its hallways on Jan. 22, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The boy "is going to have to live with this for the rest of his life," Farnell 
said. "This is probably the most horrible series of events you will ever hear 
about." 
</P>
<P>
But Ray Moore, representing the hospital, argued that the attack could not have 
been foreseen and that the hospital could not properly treat patients if it had 
to constantly police its visitors. "The real question is: Did the hospital 
properly balance security with its therapeutic duties?" Moore said. "This was 
an open facility, not a prison." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Warning Given 
</P>
<P>
Moore said Hatch was transferred to Harbor Convalescent Hospital from another 
facility that gave no warning that he might be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Moore also contested assertions by the boy's mother that he was a normal child 
before the attack. Moore said he presented witnesses who said the boy had a 
history of behavioral problems and learning disabilities that dated back to the 
age of 2. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed by the boy and his mother, who now live in Huntington Beach, 
originally included a second defendant, Faith of Our Fathers Church in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the alleged attack, the youngster went to the convalescent 
hospital with two church members for a regular Sunday prayer meeting with 
patients. The lawsuit charged that the church, now called the Living Word 
Fellowship, was partly liable for the assault because the two parishioners left 
the boy unattended while they conducted the prayer meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The mother sometimes left the boy in the care of other parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
But the church was dropped from the lawsuit last month when it agreed to a 
settlement, without admitting liability. The church will pay the boy and his 
mother $200,000 each immediately and guarantee that the youngster will receive 
at least $600,000 more. The future payment will be reduced by any damages that 
the convalescent hospital is ordered to pay, said the church's lawyer, Tony 
Serritella. 
</P>
<P>
Serritella had argued that the Torrance congregation could not be held liable 
because the hospital visits were the personal ministry of the two men and not 
church-sanctioned events. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Church Denies Liability 
</P>
<P>
"The church still denies any liability in this matter," Serritella said. "The 
settlement was a financial decision by the church's insurance carriers." 
</P>
<P>
Farnell argued Tuesday that Harbor Convalescent Hospital, 21521 S. Vermont Ave. 
in the Harbor Gateway near Torrance, had been negligent in several ways. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the hospital was not licensed to provide special care for a mental 
patient like Hatch and that administrators failed to properly research the 
patient's background. Hatch was admitted to the hospital on the recommendation 
of a physician. A background search would have shown that Hatch had previously 
been committed for 10 years to a state mental hospital and had previously been 
accused of child molestation, Farnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital employees lost track of Hatch for at least 45 minutes on the afternoon 
of the alleged assault, Farnell said. "If they had supervised him properly, 
this never would have happened," he argued. 
</P>
<P>
Farnell said the hospital should have been on notice that its supervision was 
inadequate because of two previous incidents: A month earlier, police picked up 
a patient who wandered away from the hospital undetected and, just four days 
before the alleged assault, a state inspector told administrators that they 
needed more supervisors 
</P>
<P>
on duty. 
</P>
<P>
Farnell said the damage to the youngster cannot be calculated. The boy has been 
hospitalized for severe depression and anxiety and has attempted suicide 10 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The youngster attends public school but requires tutoring and has trouble 
communicating with other children, Farnell said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the boy should be put in a residential treatment program for at least 
six months and then given outpatient counseling, along with his mother. Farnell 
asked the jury to award about $400,000 to cover past and future costs of 
therapy and hospitalization and $10 million for pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
The youngster "looks at himself as spoiled goods," Farnell said. "The quality 
of his life will never be what it should have been." He is "permanently 
scarred." 
</P>
<P>
Moore asked the jury to put aside such emotional pleas and to judge the case 
logically. 
</P>
<P>
He said the hospital had provided a reasonable amount of security without 
jeopardizing its goal of providing a "homelike therapeutic atmosphere" for 
patients. "Foolproof security can't be provided," he said. "The standard for 
licensed nursing facilities does not require a foolproof system." 
</P>
<P>
Moore conceded that the boy had been molested but said the hospital could not 
have foreseen the crime. The facilities where Hatch lived before gave no 
indication that he had been violent or sexually active, and he did not show 
those tendencies in his first 13 months at Harbor Convalescent Hospital, Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Interfering With Recovery' 
</P>
<P>
Further, an outside doctor who ordered Hatch, a Medi-Cal patient, admitted to 
the hospital did not order that he should be restrained or kept away from other 
people, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore also charged that after the incident, the boy's mother had failed to 
bring him to psychotherapy appointments and had not given him drugs ordered by 
his doctors. 
</P>
<P>
She "has actively been interfering with the recovery of the boy from the time 
of this incident," Moore said. "She has actively interfered with his therapy 
from the beginning."

MORNING BRIEFING: A COUPLE OF JABS SETTLE THE QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Promoter Bob Arum, amused by the talk of a Tony Mandarich-Mike Tyson showdown, 
told the Pittsburgh Press that Jim Brown once thought he was ready to challenge 
for the heavyweight title. 
</P>
<P>
Arum said that he and Brown, a good friend, were in London for the Muhammad 
Ali-Henry Cooper fight when Brown mentioned that he wanted to take on Ali. 
</P>
<P>
The message was relayed to Ali. 
</P>
<P>
Arum: "Ali asked us to meet him in Hyde Park, and when we did, he stuck out his 
chin and told Jimmy to hit him with everything he had. Jimmy reared back and 
Ali started slapping him, bap-bap-bap, using his open hand. Jimmy never saw any 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the end of that." 
</P>
<P>
What, me worry?: From the Sporting News: New England Patriots tight end Russ 
Francis was arrested July 2 in Incline Village, Nev., after allegedly driving 
his motorcycle 58 m.p.h. in a 45-m.p.h. zone. Francis was charged with drunk 
driving, failure to wear a helmet, driving an unregistered vehicle, failure to 
have proof of insurance, driving with an expired license and carrying a 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Said Patriot Coach Raymond Berry: "He told me not to worry about it and that it 
was no big deal at all." 
</P>
<P>
Add Sporting News: Dave Nightingale, on the second-round loss of Gabriela 
Sabatini at Wimbledon: "The London tabloids blamed the loss on the presence of 
Gaby's scorned Italian boyfriend, who appeared, uninvited, at her London hotel, 
where he plaintively pleaded his case, to no avail." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Thursday night's Dodger-Cardinal telecast, what did ABC analyst 
Joe Morgan mean when he said that Alfredo Griffin was batting below the Mendoza 
Line last year? 
</P>
<P>
Air Walsh: Bill Walsh, coach turned broadcaster, explained once why he favored 
a passing offense: "Our turnovers are downfield, theirs are at the line of 
scrimmage." 
</P>
<P>
Add Walsh: He said the reason he joined NBC was that he needed a new challenge. 
According to wire reports, the money isn't bad either. He reportedly signed for 
$750,000 a year, about twice his salary as a San Francisco 49ers vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Big cat?: From Baltimore Orioles scout Ed Farmer, marveling at the strength of 
165-pound Junior Felix, rookie outfielder for the Toronto Blue Jays: "If he's 
Junior Felix, I'd love to see Senior Felix." 
</P>
<P>
A joiner: Said Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Benny Distefano, when asked the 
craziest thing he ever did: "Taking part in a student protest against the 
government while playing winter ball in Venezuela. I didn't even know what I 
was protesting against." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Mario Mendoza, an infielder who broke in with Pittsburgh in 
1974, had a nine-year hitting average of .215. In the Sunday averages, 
ballplayers would look for his name and check the figures in his line. Nobody 
wanted to be below the line. 
</P>

TOUR DE FRANCE;

BARTEAU IS FIRST IN 13TH STAGE

<P>
While France celebrated its Bicentennial, the winner of the 13th stage of the 
Tour de France thought of an American, Greg LeMond, as he stood on the victory 
stand Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to dedicate this victory to my friend, Greg LeMond; because of him I am 
still riding," Vincent Barteau said after winning the 110-mile leg from 
Montpellier to Marseille. 
</P>
<P>
Another Frenchman, Laurent Fignon, and LeMond clung to the top two spots in the 
overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond remains seven seconds behind Fignon as the pack rested before 
encountering the mountains today. 
</P>
<P>
Barteau won by 45 seconds over another Frenchman, Jean-Claude Colotti, with 
Martial Gayant, also of France, third. 
</P>
<P>
Barteau was timed in 4 hours 17 minutes 31 seconds for the distance. Colotti 
was 45 seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, the 1986 winner, and Barteau are good friends, and LeMond encouraged 
and supported Barteau during some bleak periods. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people thought I was finished," Barteau said. "But with a lot of 
encouragement I came back." 
</P>
<P>
Barteau once held the leader's yellow jersey for almost two weeks in 1984 
before falling apart in the Alps. He has gone from team to team since. 
</P>
<P>
The next stage of the 2,020-mile race, which ends in Paris July 23, goes from 
Marseille to Gap with four climbs. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time champion Jeannie Longo of France took the overall lead in the women's 
Tour de France as American Bunki Bankaitis-Davis won the third stage, along a 
36-mile route from Martigues to Marseille. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Monique Knol of the Netherlands, the previous leader, plunged 
in the standings and is 19th, 1 minute 28 seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
Bankaitis-Davis was timed in 1 hour 20 minutes 7 seconds. She finished five 
seconds ahead of Longo, who went into the overall lead by 13 seconds.

SOME ADVICE FOR JOYNER: GET BACK TO THE BASICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading John Weyler's article recalling Wally Joyner's tremendous rookie 
season, I can't hold this thought any longer: Why doesn't Joyner employ the 
Charlie Lau weight-shift style of hitting anymore? 
</P>
<P>
Was it his (tor)mentors (Reggie Jackson, Moose Stubing) that convinced him to 
change? 
</P>
<P>
Will somebody please show Joyner some videotapes of that effortless swing he 
had back in 1986!

WHAT NBC NEEDS IS RETURN OF GARAGIOLA

<TEXT>
<P>
Bring back Joe G. 
</P>
<P>
NBC coverage of the All-Star game (Anaheim '89) was excellent. Scully, as 
usual, was superb. However, "Dutch" (to be expected) has lost his touch with 
sports announcing as well as bucking broncos. And Seaver was difficult to 
understand due to poor enunciation (mumbling) . . . bring back the bald-headed 
guy.

GM OF THE YEAR? DODGERS WERE MERELY LUCKY IN '88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When is enough, enough? Now is the time for General Manager Fred Claire of the 
Dodgers to admit his GM of the year award should be given back. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Guerrero for John Tudor was a big mistake and replacing Guerrero with 
Eddie Murray was even worse. Kirk Gibson was a one-year wonder whose vision 
must have left him. John Shelby was also a one-year hero in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Letting Steve Sax get away was unforgivable. 
</P>
<P>
When will the Dodgers again stick with a Mike Devereaux, a Cecil Espy or a Dave 
Stewart, among others. Why this affinity for American League heroes of the 
past?

RETURN TO THE BOOTH BY REAGAN PRODUCES DIVIDED CONSTITUENCY

Vin Scully must have been terribly embarrassed with his novice color man by the 
end of the first inning. I thought it would never end. If he got paid more than 
a free hot dog, it would be too much. 
</P>
<P>
I hope in the future Scully's protege will stick to horseback riding, where he 
has a lot more experience.

DOUG COLLINS DESERVED BETTER FROM THE BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does anyone really understand the firing of Doug Collins as coach of the 
Chicago Bulls? 
</P>
<P>
Here's a man who helped his organization make quantum leaps toward credibility 
and respectability in recent years and come within a heartbeat of the NBA 
finals this year. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of a much-deserved pat on the back and a contract extension, they 
gave him the air. Collins deserved better.

KING, DESPITE A PAR 71, LEADS WOMEN'S OPEN BY 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Betsy King, bidding for her first U.S. Women's Open golf title, held her ground 
in Friday's second round, and no one could mount a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old King remained at four under par with a par round of 71 for a 
138 total at Indianwood Golf and Country Club in Lake Orion, Mich., and took a 
three-stroke lead over Patty Sheehan, Colleen Walker and Lori Garbacz. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan shot a 67 to go from three over par to one under par. Garbacz started 
the day even and finished one under par despite a slide to three over par seven 
holes into the round. Walker, who started at one over par, birdied Nos. 1 and 8 
and parred everything else. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Laure de Lorenzi-Taya of Spain, who trailed King by a stroke after the 
opening round, fell victim to increasingly slick greens on the 6,109-yard Old 
Course and finished with a 74 for a 142, where she was tied with Jane Geddes, 
who shot a 72, and Dottie Mochrie, who had a 70. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hulbert birdied his last two holes for a five-under-par 66 and took a 
one-shot lead at 131 after two rounds of the Anheuser-Busch tournament at 
Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
His closest pursuer was Tim Norris, who was at 132 after a 67. Mike Donald was 
at 133 after a 66. 
</P>
<P>
Orville Moody shot a seven-under-par 64 to take a one-stroke lead over Michigan 
native Dave Hill in the first round of the Greater Grand Rapids Open for 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Douglass was at 66, while Harold Henning, Bobby Nichols, Agim Bardha and 
Senior PGA Tour newcomer Terry Dill had 67s. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Brand Jr. of Scotland birdied four of the last five holes for a 
four-under-par 67 and moved into a one-stroke lead over Australia's Peter 
Senior and Spain's Jose-Maria Olazabal with a 204 total after three rounds of 
the Scottish Open at Gleneagles. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Woosnam of Wales, who led or shared the lead through the first 36 holes, 
shot a 71 and was tied for fourth place at 206.

REDELL SHINES BRIGHTEST IN WEST'S 21-18 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As far as shadows go, it isn't a bad one to be standing in. After all, it would 
be insanity not to hand the ball to an All-American tailback who rushed for 
almost 6,000 career yards and scored 94 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, under the lights, Crespi High quarterback Ron Redell showed 4,512 
fans at Birmingham High that there is more than one guy from the Crespi 
backfield who is capable of shining. Redell completed nine of 13 passes for 85 
yards and a touchdown and was named the most valuable player in leading the 
West to a 21-18 victory in the Daily News All-Star Football game, the third 
consecutive win for the West. 
</P>
<P>
Redell spent much of his two varsity seasons handing the ball, passing the 
ball, shoveling the ball to All-American Russell White. This time, however, 
with White sidelined in the second half because of tendinitis in a leg, Redell 
was the one who answered each East challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to come in here and show the abilities I have that I haven't always 
had a chance to," said Redell, who will attend Stanford. "These games are 
great. They allow you to show exactly what you can do." 
</P>
<P>
With White sidelined after gaining 31 first-half yards, it was Redell and his 
can-do attitude in the second half that staved off an East rally. Trailing, 
14-3, at halftime, the East scored on its first possession of the second half 
on a six-yard run by Robert Augustus to move to within 14-10 with 6:32 left in 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
On the West's ensuing possession, Redell converted two third-down and one 
fourth-down situations to lead the West on a 12-play, 67-yard drive that gave 
the West a 21-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Redell's mobility -- the West used the rollout and bootleg to perfection -- was 
the key. On third and seven at the West 49, Redell was drilled but still hit 
Kurt Gustafson for a nine-yard gain and a first down. On fourth and one from 
the 31, Redell bulled inside for a first down on a keeper. And on third and 
eight from the 11, he found fullback Marrio Walker in the left flat after a 
perfect play-action fake up the middle for a 21-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to mix it up in a game like this," Redell said. "We went at both 
sides, used a lot of rollout, some drop back and some run. It worked great." 
</P>
<P>
East scored with 6:28 to play on a one-yard run up the middle by Michael 
O'Brien, who set up the score by recovering a fumble by East quarterback Cole 
Speer and rambling 21 yards to the one. Speer hit Kevin Ebenoch in the right 
corner of the end zone with the conversion to move East to within 21-18. 
</P>
<P>
On East's next possession, quarterback Rod Baltau threw a pass that was 
intercepted by Kelly Carmack at the West 40. Redell ran down the clock to 27 
seconds before the West punted. With four seconds left, Carmack again 
intercepted a Baltau pass, clinching the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The East had five turnovers, three in the first half, and 14 of the West's 
points resulted from turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
After East took a 3-0 lead on Andrew Munoz's 44-yard field goal, the defense 
stopped the West on its first possession on three plays. Sean Williams fumbled 
on the punt return, however, and Jason Stein recovered at the East 40. A 
personal foul tacked on another 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
On first down, White caught a shovel pass from Redell and cut up the left 
sideline for a 15-yard gain, and a face-mask penalty on the play gave the West 
first and goal at the five. 
</P>
<P>
White slammed his way up the middle for the score to give the West a 7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, East running back Tyler Robuck bobbled a pitch at the West 
33 and linebacker David Kim recovered. Kim also batted down two passes in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
White led the West charge after the turnover, gaining nine yards on an 
off-tackle play and adding an additional 12 on a pass from Redell. 
</P>
<P>
Redell hit Aaron Brumfield for a six-yard gain to the five, and scored two 
plays later on a one-yard quarterback sneak to give West a 14-3 lead with 2:55 
left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
East linebacker Russell Greene was injured on the second play of the five-play 
drive and reportedly suffered a broken tibia in his right leg.

POLA SPENDS DAYS WITH TROUBLED YOUTHS, AFTERNOONS AS UNPAID WESTLAKE ASSISTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How is it that a guy who never relinquished so much as a yard in his final 
three seasons as a Pacific 10 Conference fullback, can't stop giving now? 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't want to stop, for that matter? 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy Pola, who was born the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated, is a giver 
like Don King is a talker, like Donald Trump is a spender; his time, his 
knowledge, his self. 
</P>
<P>
When Jim Benkert was hired recently as Westlake High's football coach, he went 
home and dialed a phone number: Kennedy Pola's. 
</P>
<P>
Pola accepted Benkert's offer of a position as an assistant, but when Benkert 
eventually broached the subject of money, Pola balked. Only not in the sense 
one would expect. 
</P>
<P>
"Kennedy does not want to be paid," Benkert said. "He is sincere in this is 
what he wants to do. He insists on not taking any money. He's definitely a 
giver and not a taker. In fact, when I asked him about it, he looked me 
straight in the eye and said, 'I'm not going to be paid. Put the money into the 
program.' " 
</P>
<P>
Benkert is in the process of surrounding himself with a coaching staff of 
former players, including Terry Tumey and Tommy Taylor of UCLA, both of whom 
were recommended by Pola. But it is Pola who has made the biggest impact to 
date. Benkert and Pola were fellow members of Crespi's coaching staff last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Pola gets you pumped up, really, because he gets so fired up himself," 
said Luke Crawford, a returning running back for Westlake. "He's a good 
motivator. 
</P>
<P>
"After last year's season, everybody was down. But when we heard of all the 
experience we were getting and the new offense, we were all happy." 
</P>
<P>
Pola, however, does not limit his enthusiasm to the high school football field. 
His work, as a representative for Griffin Homes, a large Southern California 
land developer, is perhaps most impressive. 
</P>
<P>
What Pola actually is is an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
The mammoth former USC fullback works the streets of Pacoima like a hustler 
plays a pool hall. The bait is Pola's 6-foot-1, 270-pound frame, his gregarious 
personality and a chance at an alternative life style. The children of 
crime-ridden Pacoima are the catch. 
</P>
<P>
Pola, who is part of a staff of such workers, is the front man of sorts for 
Griffin Homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem out here is youth," Pola said. "A lot of the kids live with their 
grandmothers and there are no jobs available. It's really tough. Drugs are 
everywhere. Being a part of a gang is being a part of something." 
</P>
<P>
Which is where Pola and the staff at Griffin Homes, which is building a 
townhouse complex in Pacoima, comes in. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, they provide jobs on the construction sites, run basketball 
leagues, offer counseling and generally provide a positive image in a 
neighborhood badly in need of one. Pola, it seems, is driven by the concept of 
helping the children who, before they met him, didn't realize they could help 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I love kids," he said. "I love working with anybody who wants to do anything 
with their life. And you don't do it by telling them, but by showing them 
options. By being there every day. Every day. 
</P>
<P>
"Out here, you can't promise and not keep up." 
</P>
<P>
Since December, Pola, 25, has wandered the streets during the day and at night, 
offering his alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"I deal with the kids, the drug dealers and the gang bangers," he said. "For 
the first three months they thought I was a cop. But I'm not here to turn in 
the drug dealers, I'm here to challenge them. I'm here to challenge them for 
every kid in this neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
They are new challenges for Pola, who is of Samoan descent. His old ones 
consisted primarily of keeping his ailing knees, the subjects of eight 
surgeries, in good enough shape to last through one more Saturday afternoon. He 
played at USC from 1982-85, carrying the ball 139 times for 681 yards. He was a 
blocking back who went unclaimed in the National Football League's draft in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
But shortly thereafter, a Tampa Bay Buccaneer official contacted him and 
offered him the job of blowing open holes for a rookie running back out of 
Auburn named Bo Jackson. Jackson, however, never signed with Tampa Bay, and 
Pola's knees had seen enough anyway. He left training camp early and returned 
to Southern California to marry Diane Griffin, his college sweetheart. Yes, 
those Griffins. 
</P>
<P>
"They say when you're down," Pola said, "and you can find some other incentive 
that will help you leave it, you will choose it." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Tumey met Pola at the Rose Bowl. In fact, they met like one would figure 
a nose guard and a fullback would meet: paint to paint somewhere around the 
50-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Tumey was in the midst of his first of three seasons as an All-Pac-10 player 
for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I tackled him," Tumey said, "and said, 'Aren't you Kennedy Pola?' Then I 
helped him up and shook his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"We were acquaintances before. Now I consider us buddies. Now that we're 
graduated." 
</P>
<P>
So, when Pola approached Tumey about helping out with a certain high school 
football program in transition, Tumey consented. It will be his first try at 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew nothing about Westlake except they were having a little trouble with 
football," said Tumey, who will help coach the defense. "I thought I'd see what 
the other side was like. I wanted to be the wagon driver instead of the one 
pulling it." 
</P>
<P>
Tumey also is employed by Griffin Homes, where he has grown closer to Pola. 
</P>
<P>
"Kennedy's a great guy," he said. "He's got a lot of personality and gives a 
lot of himself." 
</P>
<P>
Several days a week, Pola sheds his size-54 sports coat and makes the drive 
from Pacoima to Westlake, where he and Diane live, for football practice at the 
local high school. As Pola sees it, some of the problems in the two areas may 
be different, but he figures he can help nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
You see, it's not about football, necessarily. It's about giving. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I'm trying to show these kids," he said. "This is not all you 
have. Let me show you something else. 
</P>
<P>
"I want them to do so much better. If they need to use me to do it, they can do 
it. I'm happy with my life, and I want others to be happy, too." 
</P>

<P>
Tony Ljubetic had four hits, including a game-winning single in the eighth 
inning, to lift Van Nuys-Notre Dame to an 8-7 victory over Sun Valley in an 
Eastern Division District 20 American Legion baseball game Friday at Poly High.

third and a grand slam in the fourth to keep Reseda's playoff hopes alive at 
Casey Stengel Field in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Calabria was four for four and scored twice for Reseda (11-10). Despite

SALKELD RECORDS WIN IN PROFESSIONAL DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roger Salkeld, making his professional debut Friday night, threw 36 pitches -- 
25 for strikes -- and picked up his first win as the Class-A Bellingham (Wash.) 
Mariners defeated the Spokane Indians, 7-3, in a Northwest League baseball game 
at Bellingham. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, a Saugus High graduate who was the third selection overall in the 
amateur baseball draft by the Seattle Mariners, did not walk a batter and 
struck out four. He allowed only an infield single. 
</P>
<P>
"That's pretty close to as sharp as I've been all year," Salkeld told The 
Bellingham Herald. "I was around the strike zone. I felt real good about it."

DAVE DISTEL: BEST WAY TO SEE OTL: INCOGNITO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
True confessions time. I went to Fiesta Island last weekend for the Old Mission 
Beach Athletic Club Over-The-Line World Championship Tournament. Please don't 
tell my mother. 
</P>
<P>
OTL, you see, has a reputation that makes Wade Boggs seem like the old image of 
Steve Garvey. If these were Biblical times, Lot's wife would be looking back at 
Fiesta Island from her seat in the shuttle bus and turning into a pillar of 
salt. 
</P>
<P>
That's how these festivities are viewed, particularly from afar. 
</P>
<P>
Even the initials "OTL" have taken the form of culprits, as though they stand 
for One Tumultuous Lark. In truth, OTL in its recreational form is played 50 
weekends a year hereabouts. No one pays much attention, except for wives and 
girlfriends and husbands and boyfriends. Not that they bother going. 
</P>
<P>
However, most folks think OTL is something that comes each July for two 
weekends and then goes away. It is on those two weekends that OTL ceases to be 
recreational and becomes, at best, socio-cultural and, at worst, downright 
bacchanal. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, were OTL a person, I wouldn't want any of my kids dating it . . . 
or visiting it. The program is something you take home in a manila envelope and 
hope Aunt Maude doesn't stumble across it. It would get as R as a movie, though 
some detractors would certainly give it an X. 
</P>
<P>
Having been away from the spectacle for a while, I ventured to Fiesta Island 
for the first of two weekends. I wanted to see if OTL had matured or mellowed 
in its 36th year. 
</P>
<P>
I found that OTL really has two personalities, one no more (or less) obnoxious 
than any weekend at any beach and the other as loud and outlandish as the most 
abrasive Las Vegas comic. 
</P>
<P>
You see, with OTL, you are dealing with both video and audio. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the games themselves, which are not a high spectator 
priority, Fiesta Island in a visual sense is like a walk on the boardwalk any 
weekend. The difference, of course, is that there is no boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
What you see are people dressed anywhere from scantily to casually. They are 
carrying beverages, beverage containers and folding chairs. Collectively, they 
are covered with enough oil to fill the tanks of the Exxon Valdez and leave a 
slick from here to the Aleutians. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on these two weekends a year, I would like to open a concession stand 
on the corner of E. Mission Bay and Fiesta Island Road. I would sell suntan 
oil, beverage containers and folding chairs, and I could retire and play OTL 
recreationally the other 50 weekends of the year. 
</P>
<P>
These people, at least 95% of them, are going to Fiesta Island to either get 
some sun or look at each other or both, exactly the same reasons they would go 
to Mission Beach or La Jolla Shores or Moonlight. On these weekends, they all 
go to Fiesta Island because that is where everyone is going, except for the 
people who are convinced no one goes anymore because it is too crowded. 
</P>
<P>
This game of OTL, thus, plays the role of the host who gets everyone together 
and then cannot get anyone's attention. To a great extent, the guests turn 
their cheeks -- yes, those cheeks -- on the games themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Most folks do not know who is playing whom or where. At least on this weekend, 
spouses and lovers pay attention. After all, world championships will be 
decided sometime Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there is one way to follow exactly what is going on. 
</P>
<P>
You listen to the public address announcer. This is the audio part. This is 
where the character of these weekends is defined. Understandably, there are 
folks who find the P.A. announcer to be offensive, though it has nothing to do 
with his breath or his clothes or the way he cuts his hair. 
</P>
<P>
No, this fellow has to announce what teams are playing where. To do so, he has 
to identify the teams. He can do it there, but we cannot do it here. 
</P>
<P>
Many, maybe most, of the team names are ribald or vulgar or insensitive or . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
You get the idea. The team names, in fact, differentiate one year from another 
more than anything else, because darn near everything else stays the same. 
</P>
<P>
This is the year, for example, that Pete Rose, Steve Garvey, Wade Boggs and 
Richard Silberman are taking a licking in team names. You get a little bit of a 
black eye, and these folks will come up with a team name that'll punch you in 
the nose. 
</P>
<P>
Name anyone who has been touched by controversy in the past 36 years, and I 
guarantee you that OTL teams have been named in his or her dishonor. You can 
trace history by OTL team names, though the city schools are unlikely to adopt 
this approach to keeping munchkins interested. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, I do have a solution for anyone who would like to enjoy Fiesta 
Island this weekend without being exposed to the obscene and outrageous side of 
the OTL experience. 
</P>
<P>
Wear ear muffs. 
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't be the first. Right, Mom?

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: SOME 401(K) FUNDS CAN HELP BUY HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I plan to buy a home in five years. In the meantime, should I avoid 
putting any money into an individual retirement account or 401(k) plan? I know 
many friends who have had to pay hefty early withdrawal penalties when they 
have used proceeds from these accounts for the down payments on their homes. -- 
J. S. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your best course of action depends greatly on your individual 
circumstances, the details of which you neglected to include. However, we can 
still offer some general guidance to help you evaluate your situation. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, are you even sure that you qualify to make a tax-deferred 
contribution to an IRA? Remember, Congress rewrote the eligibility rules in 
1986. Currently, only workers whose companies do not offer qualified pension 
plans or who make less than $35,000 as individuals or $50,000 if married are 
entitled to make tax-deferred IRA contributions. 
</P>
<P>
You probably don't even want to consider opening an IRA unless your 
contributions can be tax deferred, and even if you do qualify, pitfalls and 
penalties await if you withdraw your funds before age 59 1/2. In addition to 
being slapped with ordinary income taxes on the funds, you will be forced to 
pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty. By the time the dust settles, you can find 
yourself with far less money to use for that down payment than you originally 
thought. In general, our experts say you are probably better served forgetting 
about IRAs entirely. 
</P>
<P>
However, the 401(k) plans offered by many corporations are an entirely 
different matter. And, depending on the rules governing the plan at your 
company, you might want to consider enrolling in one. In general, these plans 
allow employees to place a limited portion of their gross income each year in 
tax-deferred savings accounts that are invested and managed by their employers. 
This year, the maximum you can contribute is $7,627. 
</P>
<P>
Although 401(k) account funds may be withdrawn without penalty only when you 
turn age 59 1/2 or suffer certain hardships, many companies allow their 
employees to borrow against their account balances. You should check if this 
choice is available to you and what interest rate and other fees are charged 
for this service. 
</P>
<P>
You should also find out whether your company will match any of your 401(k) 
contributions. Many companies do -- typically by as much as 50% -- which means 
an employee's account grows more rapidly than it would in another type of 
account paying the same interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
So, the bottom line is that you must investigate the particulars of the 401(k) 
plan offered by your company. If you are allowed to borrow against your balance 
at a reasonable interest rate and fees, and if your company matches a portion 
of your contribution, our experts say you would be wise to run, not walk, to 
your employee benefits department and sign up. Otherwise, you are just as well 
off paying your income taxes now and saving whatever you can. 
</P>
<P>
Estimated Tax Depends on Withholding 
</P>
<P>
Q: I plan to sell some stock, which will give me a sizable gain before the end 
of the current quarter. In paying estimated tax on this gain, must I pay the 
full amount by Sept. 15, or can it be spread out over the balance of the year? 
-- N. E. L. 
</P>
<P>
A: Income taxes are technically due on April 15 following the tax year for 
which you are reporting. However, as you apparently know, both California and 
the federal government require taxpayers to prepay virtually all of their 
income taxes through a pay-as-you-go system of withholding. Taxes on income not 
subject to direct withholding -- such as extraordinary gains from asset sales 
-- must be paid with the filing of an estimated tax form every quarter. 
</P>
<P>
How much you actually wind up paying in estimated tax on Sept. 15 depends on 
how close you are to meeting the withholding requirements, which are the same 
for both California and the federal government. By the time the year ends, you 
must meet at least one test of sufficient tax withholding. Either you must have 
at least 90% of your total tax obligation withheld during the year -- and it 
must be done during the quarter the income was received -- or you must have 
prepaid an amount equal to your entire federal tax obligation for the previous 
year. If you fail both tests, you will be hit with a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Our experts suggest that you do a quick estimate of your total tax obligation 
for all of 1989 as well as your total tax withholding. This should help you 
determine the amount you must prepay by Sept. 15 to avoid any penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Divorce Won't Change House Cost Basis 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I bought a house in 1954 for $25,000. In 1982, we divorced 
and I was awarded the house we had held as community property. Should the value 
of both halves of the property be set as of 1982, as it is in the event a 
surviving spouse inherits a deceased's interest in their community property? I 
am sure others wonder as I do if the same principle applies to the death of a 
marriage as to the death of a spouse. -- J. F. H. 
</P>
<P>
A: Although the pain and sense of loss in a divorce is quite similar to that 
caused by the death of a spouse, the Internal Revenue Service treats the two 
events quite differently. 
</P>
<P>
When a spouse dies, the IRS allows the survivor to value both halves of their 
community held property as of the spouse's date of death, not its original 
cost. The net effect of this bit of largess from Congress permits the surviving 
spouse to realize a larger non-taxable gain when these assets are sold. 
(However, this is only true for assets held as community property; for those 
held as joint tenants or tenants in common, only the deceased's half is valued 
as of the date of death.) 
</P>
<P>
In the case of divorce, how the assets were held doesn't matter. Neither half 
is treated to an increase in value when the marriage is dissolved; the original 
cost basis remains unchanged. In your case, the house you received in the 
settlement still has its original $25,000 cost basis. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys and accountants say that when property settlements are being worked 
out, they try to assign equally not only the marriage's assets but the cost 
bases of those assets. And you can see why. It may do a spouse no good to 
receive an asset worth several hundred thousand dollars if virtually all of it 
is taxable upon sale.

DOW ADDS 16.50 TO JULY HOT STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market ran its July record to nine gains in nine sessions with an 
afternoon advance Friday as traders sorted through a series of new statistics 
on the state of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index, up every day so far this month, rose 16.50 to 
2,554.82 for its third straight post-crash high. The average was up 66.96 
points for the week. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of June, the index has jumped 114.76 points. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was focused on blue chip stocks, and advancing issues edged declines 
by a margin of 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the market's recent gains to a growing view that the economy 
will not weaken enough to cause more than a mild recession. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 183.48 million shares, up from 
153.80 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The market slumped earlier, however, knocking 26 points off the Dow at one 
stage, as brokers sifted through the stream of economic data that included a 
worrisome rise in June's core wholesale inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
The reports from the government lent support to the widespread view that the 
pace of economic activity was continuing to slow, fulfilling a primary goal of 
the Federal Reserve's credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed reported a 0.2% drop in industrial production for June, and a decline 
in capacity utilization at the nation's factories, utilities and mines. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Labor Department said its producer price index of finished 
goods dropped 0.1% last month. That number came in below estimates calling for 
an increase of between 0.1% and 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
However, the producer price index, excluding its sometimes volatile food and 
energy components, was up 0.7%. That left market participants without a 
conclusive signal of slackening inflationary pressures, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Time Inc. fell 4 3/4 to 145 1/4, and Warner Communications, the most active Big 
Board issue, rose 2 to 64 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Alcoa, which received approval from directors to buy back as many as 10 million 
of its shares, climbed 1 1/2 to 68 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Other gainers among the blue chips included General Motors, up 1 1/2 at 43 1/2; 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 1/8 at 36 3/8; Exxon, up 5/8 at 45 5/8; 
General Electric, up 1/4 at 54 5/8, and Procter &amp; Gamble, up 1 1/8 at 116 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell, up sharply in recent sessions on takeover speculation, fell back 5 
to 81 in the absence of any news to back up the conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed lower in extremely thin trading after languishing all 
day, smothered by foreign brokers launching sell programs at each sign of 
renewed trading activity, brokers said. The Nikkei 225-share index eased 56.39 
points to close at 33,574.77. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices ended at a new post-crash high in energetic trading 
buoyed by a series of rumors about potential takeover bids. The 100-share 
Financial Times index finished up 15.7 points at 2,273.7. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Prices sagged in the bond market and long-term interest rates rose in volatile 
trading as the government's economic data wasn't weak enough to entice the 
credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 13/32 point, or about $4 per $1,000 
face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, 
climbed to 8.08% from 8.03% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, evidence of economic weakness furnished by the government reports 
inspired buying enthusiasm in the bond market but the rally soon faded. 
</P>
<P>
Normally the credit market would welcome signs that a slowdown in economic 
activity is being accompanied by a moderation in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But Maria F. Ramirez, an economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert, said the market 
had built up hopes ahead of the numbers and pushed bond prices to very high 
levels. When the reports merely confirmed widely held views, traders decided to 
sell and collect profits. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.188%, down from 9.313% Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained ground against all major currencies except the Canadian 
dollar in defiance of the statistics that indicated the economy is cooling off. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, news of a sluggish economy would send the dollar lower on 
speculation that the Federal Reserve would continue easing its hold on interest 
rates. But dealers said the fact that the dollar didn't fall much immediately 
after the figures were released encouraged players to buy the currency. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the old story of selling on the rumor and buying on the fact," said 
Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
Traders sold dollars throughout the week on the expectation that the numbers 
would be weak. "When they came out and they were weak, everybody was looking to 
buy back dollars at the same time," Flanagan said. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was volatile and heavy, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 139.50 Japanese yen, up 0.45 yen from late 
Thursday. Later in London, the dollar traded higher at 140.40 yen. In New York, 
the dollar closed at 140.85 yen, up from Thursday's 139.45 yen. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $1.6125 to buy 
one pound, cheaper than $1.6240 late Thursday. In New York, one pound cost 
$1.6050, less expensive than Thursday's $1.6205.

FACES . . .: LIVENING UP 'BERNIE'S' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It heavily involves a dead body -- who's heavily dead," says Catherine Mary 
Stewart of "Weekend at Bernie's," a comedy farce in which she stars with 
Jonathan Silverman, Andrew McCarthy and Terry Kiser as the late, unlamented 
Bernie. 
</P>
<P>
"The body does stay intact," she says. "But it gets involved in all kinds of 
situations. And since Jonathan is responsible for the body -- trying to hide it 
as well as hide the fact that it's dead -- it sort of comes between our 
romance." 
</P>
<P>
"Bernie's" is one of a string of movies the Canadian-born actress has recently 
completed. " 'World Gone Wild,' 'Dudes' and 'Riding the Edge' -- they all came 
and left around the same time," she says cheerfully. "They actually played for 
a weekend at least, maybe even two." 
</P>
<P>
She tries not to let it get her down: "Whether or not a movie is successful is 
so unpredictable. I can't spend my life sitting around wondering if the next 
one is going to make me a movie star." 
</P>
<P>
As for the three-name syndrome, that's pretty much out of her hands too: "Mary 
Stuart Masterson, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio -- it sounds like a bunch of 
Catholic girls running around Hollywood, doesn't it? My real last name is 
Nursall, but in the first movie I did, the director hated my name and said, 
'You've got to change it.' So I took my mother's maiden name, Stewart." Because 
there was another Cathy Stewart in Equity, she tacked on her middle name, Mary. 
"It seemed like a good idea at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, whose TV credits include "Hollywood Wives" and "Passion and Paradise," 
is also the veteran of some interesting casting -- like playing the young Joan 
Collins character in the 1986 miniseries "Sins." 
</P>
<P>
"What a match, huh?," she says, giggling. "I did have my hair dyed black, so 
that helped. The funny thing was, Joan, my younger brother and I all spoke with 
an English accent -- but our sister spoke with a French accent, and so did our 
mother. It was a real international potpourri." JANICE ARKATOV

PUBLIC BREAST-FEEDING

As a breast-feeding mother, I was appalled at Chasen's statement regarding 
breast-feeding policies at its establishment -- "We don't get those kind of 
people here" ("Restaurants Rethink Their Nursing Policies in the Wake of 
Lawsuit," by Laurie Ochoa, June 28). 
</P>
<P>
I am a college-educated professional and a mother of two (I even read the 
newspaper) and have (gasp!) nursed both of my babies in premier restaurant 
dining rooms. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what "kind of people" frequent Chasen's, but you can be sure it 
won't be me -- breast-feeding or otherwise.

FAIRNESS ON TELEVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding " 'Rage' Documentary Puts PBS in Its Own Mideast Standoff," Howard 
Rosenberg's July 12 column about "Days of Rage": 
</P>
<P>
If PBS and public television stations were, as Rosenberg suggested, so afraid 
of controversy that might offend funding sources and potential donors, why 
would KCET and most PBS stations have carried a 45-minute Jim Lehrer interview 
with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat or a half-hour conversation with King Hussein 
of Jordan earlier this spring? 
</P>
<P>
The real issue surrounding the broadcasting of Jo Franklin-Trout's film 
commentary is not an obsession with balance but rather a commitment to 
fairness. 
</P>
<P>
If any producer creates a program that makes serious claims of illegal behavior 
against an individual or a group, public television is obliged by its own 
standards of journalism to give those accused a reasonable opportunity to 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
Since "Days of Rage" created, as Rosenberg once wrote, "a documentary-length 
statement without rebuttal," it was up to PBS and public television stations to 
be concerned about how to provide for a fair response. Although public 
television is willing to create an appropriate forum for such a response, it is 
clear that the film's producer has felt that effort to be unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Public television accepts its obligation to take the heat in matters of public 
controversy. But to do that responsibly, we must not only demand respect for 
the intelligence of our viewers but also for their common sense of fairness.

THE CONTROVERSY OVER MAPPLETHORPE'S ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times writer Allan Parachini misses the point about the controversy surrounding 
the works of the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe ("Arousing Art," July 
11). 
</P>
<P>
Ancient Greek sculptors did not use my tax money to create their art; Mr. 
Mapplethorpe did. Using public money for what is a very private matter -- art 
-- is bound to run into difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Bullwhips protruding from buttocks (as in a Mapplethorpe self-portrait) are, to 
most, more offensive than the bestial detail of a mythical creature! 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mr. Mapplethorpe was primarily a photographer, and the status of 
photography as art is still a point of contention among many aestheticians. 
</P>
<P>
But all of this only serves to illustrate that public money should not be spent 
on art or religion -- for the same reason -- and that the National Endowment 
for the Arts has no more right to exist in this nation than would a "National 
Endowment for Religion." 
</P>
<P>
If the state endowed any religion with taxpayers' money, it would be asking 
certain individuals to subsidize and promote what they consider to be offensive 
or evil. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason for a program such as the National Endowment for the Arts is to 
extort money from unwilling contributors in order to subsidize projects that 
would not be subsidized voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, such a program cannot, by its own nature, "represent" American 
interests but only serve a few Washingtonian highbrows' appetites for art-world 
prestige and power.

RUNDGREN LETS THE HUMANITY SHINE THROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's Todd Rundgren -- whose technocratic tendencies have inspired his 
deification by loyal followers -- up to? First he titles his latest album 
"Nearly Human," then he starts off his concert Thursday at the Wiltern with his 
old song "Real Man," in both cases placing the music in a very human, even 
spontaneous setting -- well, as spontaneous as a choreographed, uniformed 
11-piece band can be. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Todd's tired of being Godd. Judging by Thursday's show -- his first local 
appearance in two years -- what he really wants to be is Daryl Hall. And why 
not? Save for his stringy hair and cold-ravaged voice, Rundgren showed that 
he's more than got the goods: His distinct, pale-face take on Philly soul 
(which actually predates that of Hall &amp; Oates) has always been the bit of 
humanity shining through the cosmic slop and technophilia that has bogged down 
much of his music. 
</P>
<P>
Encouragingly, many of the night's best moments came from the new album, which 
may just be Rundgren's most solid album -- and the best intersection of 
Thinking Todd and Feeling Todd -- since the vaunted 1972 double-disc 
"Something/Anything." It's a rare figure who can write "Hawking," a loving 
meditation on the spirituality of the universe, inspired by physicist Stephen 
Hawking, and "For the Want of a Nail," a cause-and-effect syllogism of profound 
simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that by stripping his music to its most human level, Rundgren 
finally did allow an honest peek at the divinity that fuels it. 
</P>
<P>
The taped accompaniment that Rundgren has in the past used to fill out his 
sound was left Thursday to opening Big Bam Boo, an English duet whose 
boom-box-backed melodic songs and two-part harmonies are pleasant, but without 
much in the way of artistic vision. STEVE HOCHMAN

PLANT OF THE WEEK: GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Limonium sinuatum 
</P>
<P>
Statice or sea lavender 
</P>
<P>
Annual with papery flowers used in fresh or dried arrangements 
</P>
<P>
It may be an annual in other parts of the country, but in frost-free sections 
of Southern California, statice is a constant. The plants may not be in bloom 
every minute, but they will be there, ready to spring into action when you 
least expect it. 
</P>
<P>
Statice officially blooms in spring and summer, but many gardeners pick 
unofficial blooms well into December. 
</P>
<P>
If you think you are unfamiliar with this modest but dependable flower, then 
you haven't been dining out much; every other restaurant, high or low, seems to 
favor statice as obligatory table decor. It also has enjoyed high visibility 
because of all the attention focused on dried flowers in wreaths and other 
arrangements in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Like the strawflower, it is a natural for drying because it looks dry even when 
it is dewy and fresh. Unlike the strawflower, it has no daisy-like familiarity; 
it doesn't look quite like any other flower. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the flower parts, the calyx (usually white) and the corolla 
(shades of blue, rose or yellow), seem to grow out of the ends of the stalks, 
as if they were meant to be leaves, while most of the leaves remain at the base 
of the plant. The sturdy flower stalks are easily cut and remain strong even 
after drying (although brittleness can be a problem). It is not at all fussy 
about soil, and it is remarkably drought-tolerant. Just be sure to give it good 
drainage. 
</P>
<P>
Statice usually is available at nurseries in 2- and 4-inch pots, and it is very 
easy to grow from seed -- easier now than a few years ago, in fact. When I 
first started growing it, the seed arrived in the form of loose dried flowers, 
uncleaned and with erratic germinating powers. Now many seed catalogues offer 
clean statice seed with more predictable germination, and some even give a 
choice of colors. (The one color I want I can't get: plain old pink; I have to 
content myself with rose or fuchsia.) 
</P>
<P>
Seeds are available in individual colors from The Country Garden, Route 2, 
Crivitz, Wis. 54114; Nichols Garden Nursery, 1190 N. Pacific Highway, Albany, 
Ore. 97421; W. Atlee Burpee &amp; Co., Warminster, Pa. 18974 and Pinetree 
Garden Seeds, New Gloucester, Me. 04260. JUDITH SIMS

WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DEDICATED DIGGERS AND PLANTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
To conserve moisture in container plantings, be sure to mulch. 
</P>
<P>
Keep faded blooms picked off your annuals so they will continue blooming and 
filling the summer garden with color. 
</P>
<P>
For interesting foliage color, consider planting the multicolored coleus or 
gray-foliaged dusty miller, artemisia, parrots beak and others found at a local 
nursery. 
</P>
<P>
For some red-hot color in the hot summer garden, plant salvia.

TALKS ON FUCHSIAS, HERBS CAP BUSY WEEKEND FOR GARDENERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH CHRISTIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a busy weekend for gardeners: Not only is it the height of the growing 
season for most plants and vegetables, but shows and seminars abound. 
</P>
<P>
Today at 9:30 a.m., the Sherman Library and Gardens in Corona del Mar is 
sponsoring a lecture on summer fuchsia care. 
</P>
<P>
These gorgeous, purplish-pink flowering perennials are at their peak now and 
the Sherman Gardens is a splendid place to see them in full bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Brozowski, color specialist for the gardens, will lead the talk. 
</P>
<P>
Most gardeners in Southern California plant fuchsias in hanging baskets because 
of their growth form, Brozowski says, but you can also grow them in tree form; 
they also do well planted directly into the ground. Fuchsias like dappled shade 
with no midday sun, and heat is an enemy -- which is why fuchsias thrive in 
coastal gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"Good air circulation is a must," Brozowski says. "Otherwise, they get diseases 
and insects." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watering Is the Key 
</P>
<P>
As with most flowering plants, proper watering is key. "Fuchsias like to be 
moist in spring and summer," Brozowski says. "We water two or three times a 
week at the gardens." She stresses that a light soil mix is important for 
drainage, so the fuchsias don't sit in puddles. 
</P>
<P>
Brozowski recommends a balanced fertilizer on a twice-a-month schedule all 
through the blooming season. "We fertilize nine to 10 months out of the year; 
we've tried feeding both more frequently and less frequently, and every two 
weeks is best." 
</P>
<P>
Fuchsias bloom only on new growth, so an annual pruning is critical, Brozowski 
says. She suggests cutting the plants back to six inches of woody stems at the 
end of November and then reducing watering to about once a week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keep Pinching 
</P>
<P>
"When they start to leaf out again, keep pinching them back and start 
fertilizing," Brozowski says. "Take the top two leaves off each branch, so 
you'll get two branches instead of one." She says that at Sherman Gardens, 
fuchsias are pinched back until late April or early May. "You don't keep going 
after the same branches; you'll see which ones need it. And don't wait till the 
new growth is too long." 
</P>
<P>
When buds start to set, stop pinching but continue to be meticulous about 
removing dead leaves to discourage mildew and pests. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Library and Gardens is at 2647 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Corona del 
Mar. Admission to the garden is $2 for all ages; the fuchsia talk is free. 
</P>
<P>
Lure and Lore of Herbs -- Did you know that it's perfectly acceptable to sound 
the "h" in "herb"? Have you heard that herbs were first used by cavemen, who 
accidentally dropped fresh meat into thickets and discovered that it tasted 
better when roasted? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
But you will learn these facts and much more from a talk by Kirby Davis, an 
herb specialist, Sunday at 2 p.m. at the South Coast Botanic Garden on the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
The loquacious Davis is an expert on all aspects of herbs, from their history 
to their cultivation to their use in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"Soil is very important," Davis says, "and six to eight hours of sunlight every 
day are vital." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best in Raised Beds 
</P>
<P>
Davis says herbs need excellent drainage and do best in raised beds. She fills 
her herb beds with a mixture of about half compost, one-sixth vermiculite, 
one-sixth peat moss and one-sixth sandblaster-grade sand. "This type of sand is 
a little more expensive but it's cleaner and the grains are bigger, which makes 
for better water run-off," Davis says. "And the peat moss is a natural 
inhibitor of bacteria." 
</P>
<P>
The most popular herbs in Southern California, according to Davis, are thyme, 
bay trees, parsley and basil, all of which do very well in our Mediterranean 
climate. "People also seem to want tarragon but it's very hard to grow," she 
says. "It just doesn't seem to seed well here." 
</P>
<P>
Her favorite fertilizer is rabbit manure, because "it's so pure that it goes 
right to work without burning the plants, and the digested alfalfa fiber amends 
the soil." She likes fish emulsion but doesn't like the neighborhood cats it 
attracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Herbs are so fragrant that most pests leave them alone," Davis says. The only 
exception is basil: Hungry insects seem to find it as tasty as do humans. Herbs 
will draw aphids, which Davis thwarts with a steady stream of water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bane of Gardener's Existence 
</P>
<P>
And snails are the bane of an herb gardener's existence, Davis says. She 
recommends either crushing them with your heel -- messy but extremely 
satisfying when you discover all your new plantings mauled by the voracious 
creatures -- or using "That's It," a poison that comes in tiny flakes and so is 
less likely to be sampled by pets. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Botanic Garden is at 26300 Crenshaw Blvd., on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula. Admission to the garden is $3 for adults, $1.50 for seniors 62 and 
older, $1.50 for students with ID, 75 cents for children ages 5 to 12, and free 
for children 4 and under. The herb lecture is free. 
</P>
<P>
Bromeliad Show -- If you're planning to be down San Diego way this weekend, you 
might want to stop by Balboa Park, 1549 El Prado, for a free bromeliad show and 
sale. The show will be open today and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission 
is free.

DAY HIKE: EL DORADO NATURE CENTER A MID-METROPOLIS OASIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Californians have long lamented the destruction of the natural world 
caused by freeway construction, but in one community, freeway building resulted 
in the formation of a unique nature center. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1960s, during construction of the San Gabriel River/San Diego 
freeway interchange, earthmovers were moving millions of cubic yards of earth. 
Thanks to concerned citizens and conservationists, some of that earth was moved 
to form 800-acre El Dorado Regional Park and 80-acre El Dorado Nature Center. 
The park is everything a big park should be, with wide lawns, ball fields and 
picnic areas. The nature center is a surprise -- an oasis in the midst of the 
metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
Surely this land has undergone a strange evolution: from San Gabriel River 
flood plain to bean fields to freeway interchange to nature preserve. Only in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the city's beach, El Dorado Nature Center is Long Beach's biggest 
natural attraction. Established in 1969, this man-made wildlife sanctuary 
includes two lakes and a stream, tree-lined meadows and low rolling hills. It's 
a serene habitat for flora and fauna as well as a tranquil retreat for humans. 
</P>
<P>
Several ecological zones are represented in the nature preserve, which for the 
most part emphasizes native California flora. Walkers can tour oak woodland, 
grassy meadow and chaparral communities, which are representative of Southern 
California plant communities, and can meander among redwoods and a white alder 
grove -- vegetation typical of the northern part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado Nature Center's small museum, perched on an island, is a good place 
to learn about Southern California's plant life and wildlife. This satellite 
museum of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County features a 
"hands-on" ecology exhibit and a gallery that displays the work of nature 
artists and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Kids will particularly enjoy a visit to the nature center. The museum's 
exhibits, interpretive walks and even the pint-sized drinking fountains were 
designed with the smaller nature lover in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Two miles of easy trail circle El Dorado. A one-mile nature trail is keyed to 
an interpretive pamphlet available from the museum. Another mile of trail loops 
around the preserve's two ponds. 
</P>
<P>
Bird-watchers flock to the preserve because more than 150 resident and 
migratory bird species have been sighted. A bird checklist is available at the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trailhead: From Interstate 405 (San Diego Freeway), exit on 
Studebaker Road and travel north about 2 1/2 miles to Spring Street. Take a 
right on Spring Street and proceed three-quarters of a mile to the entrance of 
El Dorado Park Nature Center. You can park in the lot by the nature center 
museum for $2 weekdays, $3 weekends, or park for free along Spring Street. 
</P>
<P>
Trails are open 8 a.m.-4 p.m. daily. The museum is open 10 a.m.-4 p.m. 
Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. For more information about 
El Dorado Nature Center and its many interpretive programs, call (213) 
421-9431, Ext. 3415. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Pick up a nature trail interpretive pamphlet from the museum, then 
head out across the bridge into the reserve. Enjoy the native plant 
communities, including a cattail-lined creek and a chaparral-cloaked hillside. 
And keep an eye out for two non-natives that have been part of the Southland 
scene for more than a century and seem like natives -- the large, plume-like 
pampas grass from South America and the ubiquitous eucalyptus. Be sure to get 
the "big picture" from the observation tower, the preserve's highest point. 
</P>
<P>
When you reach a trail junction, you can proceed straight ahead on the "One 
Mile" nature trail or bear right for a 2-mile hike. The second mile of trail 
meanders past the park's ponds before returning to the nature center building.

PILOT OF WANDERING PLANE HAD BEEN SHOT IN STOMACH

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The case of the lawyer who stunned rescuers by surviving a crash landing into 
the Atlantic Ocean grew ever more unusual Friday as investigators revealed that 
Thomas Root had suffered a gunshot wound before he was rescued. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Hollywood, Fla., where Root is recuperating in a hospital, said 
they had not yet determined how the wound -- roughly two inches above Root's 
navel -- was inflicted. But powder burns on his skin indicate the gun was close 
to his body on the right-hand side, Hollywood Police Chief Richard Witt told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"The gun was held right to his body within a close proximity and fired," Witt 
said. Attempted suicide was the "first hypothesis" investigators drew from the 
available evidence, he added. Officials said there is no indication that anyone 
else was aboard the single-engine Cessna 210 with the pilot or that he was 
wounded before boarding the plane Thursday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Root was "resting" in his room, hospital officials said. And federal 
investigators, describing him as heavily sedated, said they would not attempt 
to interview him until this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Family members, however, who talked with Root on Friday, insisted that the gun 
in the plane must have gone off by accident. "The only thing that we can figure 
out is that somehow that (the shooting) happened on impact when the plane 
crashed," Root's brother-in-law, Brett Geer, told reporters after visiting Root 
at Hollywood Memorial Hospital along with his sister, Root's wife Kathy. 
</P>
<P>
Associates described Root as an avid gun collector. Virginia police, 
accompanied by federal officials, earlier this spring raided Root's locker at 
the suburban Virginia airport where he kept his plane, the Associated Press 
reported. The officials found nearly three dozen weapons, including a machine 
gun. All were legal under federal and state law, although the machine gun was 
not registered with Virginia officials, a misdemeanor in that state. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow attorneys here and former clients painted a picture of Root as a man at 
the center of a complex web of controversial dealings that may have been 
closing in on him in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The business ventures have involved some $15 million raised from several 
thousand people around the country by a Georgia firm, Sonrise Management 
Services, for projects to open radio stations. Until recently, Root represented 
all of the Sonrise investors in applications to the Federal Communications 
Commission for FM radio licenses. 
</P>
<P>
To date, none of the investors has received a license and the money raised from 
them has been almost wholly spent on management and legal fees, according to 
sworn testimony by Sonrise officials. The company's business dealings are 
currently the subject of investigations by state and federal agencies, 
officials said Friday. Root's representation of Sonrise license applicants also 
has been questioned by federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Sonrise applicants are 16 partnerships bidding for FM radio stations 
in central and northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Hamming, a Monterey investor in one partnership seeking an FM radio 
license in the Central Valley town of Madera, said he already had "kissed the 
money good-bye." 
</P>
<P>
An investor in Oxnard, Reuben Miranda, said he remained anxious. "I got $10,000 
in this thing," said Miranda, who received a Sonrise letter soliciting 
investments at the Baptist church outside Oxnard where he is pastor. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a really nice sales pitch," said another investor, who sank some 
$50,000 into shares in 15 separate license applications and who has so far 
received no return on his money. "It was slick." 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the sales pitch was a promotional videotape prepared by the 
company, in which Sonrise Chairman Ralph M. Savage described the firm as a 
"Christian-based organization" -- a professed orientation reflected in the 
firm's name -- whose goal was to "maintain the highest ethic in offering the 
potential investor the best return for his investment." 
</P>
<P>
Although many firms nationally work as consultants to assist investors in 
obtaining broadcast licenses, Sonrise differed markedly from most of the rest, 
according to lawyers familiar with its business practices. In typical cases, a 
group of people who wish to apply for a broadcast license will seek out a 
lawyer or consultant for assistance. In Sonrise's case, the company employed a 
sales force that at one point numbered as many as 120, which sought out 
potential investors and tried to convince them of the benefits of seeking a 
radio license, Savage said in a deposition filed with the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
The company appears to have concentrated on seeking investors who had 
connections with evangelical and fundamentalist churches in the Southeast, 
lawyers who have interviewed Sonrise clients said. Some of the partnerships 
apparently hoped to start stations with religious programming. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, as some individual investors began to contact lawyers in Washington 
to discuss filing suits against Sonrise, the firm sent a letter to clients 
raising questions about Root's representation of their applications and seeking 
to oust him as counsel for the partnerships. In confidential memoranda sent to 
the investors and made available to The Times, Root has defended his 
performance and raised questions, in turn, about Sonrise. 
</P>
<P>
Most investors contacted Friday said they had no indication of problems until 
they heard of Root's dramatic plane flight Thursday. Root took off from 
Washington early Thursday, heading for a court hearing in Rocky Mount, N.C., 
about two hours away. But shortly before reaching that destination, the plane 
veered off course, heading off into the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Military pilots who tracked the plane for nearly four hours reported Root was 
slumped backward in his seat. When the plane ran out of fuel and crashed into 
the ocean near the Bahamas, rescuers were stunned when Root, hurt but alive, 
swam away from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
While Root's activities may have been a mystery to many of his clients, both 
Root and Sonrise have come repeatedly to the attention of federal and state 
officials in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
At the FCC, documents show hearing examiners recently have used words such as 
"sham" in written orders directing the company to answer questions about the FM 
applications it has filed. They have on several occasions chastised Root for 
failure to appear at hearings or to present witnesses in cases. 
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, Secretary of State Rufus Edmisten said Friday that his 
office has been investigating Sonrise since earlier this year, examining 
allegations that its sales practices violated securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
And in Georgia, where Sonrise has its headquarters, state officials in June 
referred a complaint about Sonrise business practices to the federal Securities 
and Exchange Commission, according to documents released by the state office of 
consumer affairs. An SEC spokesman, citing agency policy, would neither confirm 
nor deny that the agency had opened an investigation of Sonrise. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the FCC also said Root has been under investigation for 
allegedly preparing false documents to show that he had won permission from the 
Federal Aviation Administration to build tall radio towers in potential 
airplane flight paths. The sources said the investigation was referred to the 
FAA. An agency spokesman, John Leyden, said agency policy bars any comment on 
such matters. 
</P>
<P>
Root, himself, was described by acquaintances as creative and hard working, 
but, said one lawyer, "he's always spending most of his energy digging himself 
out of holes he had gotten himself into." 
</P>
<P>
Root, another lawyer said, built his practice in the mid-1980s, when the FCC 
began deregulating the broadcast industry and opening it up to new entries, by 
combing through FCC files looking for license applicants without attorneys. He 
then wrote to them and flew in his private plane to meet them to sign them up 
as clients. 
</P>
<P>
Root would compare himself to traveling Hong Kong tailors who visit small U.S. 
cities and invite men seeking suits to come to a specified hotel to be 
measured. "There's nothing like pressing the flesh. You get the check right 
away," one attorney recalled him saying.

DEFENSE BUDGET OKD BUT PANEL WANTS B-2 TEST 
</P>

<P>
The Senate Armed Services Committee on Friday approved President Bush's 
$305.5-billion defense spending request for fiscal 1990 virtually untouched but 
stipulated that no new money can be spent on the controversial B-2 stealth 
bomber until it completes its first flight tests. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's bill, which soon will be presented to the full Senate, is a 
strong endorsement of the budget submitted to Congress by Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney, who called for an expenditure of $4.8 billion on the stealth 
bomber while eliminating a number of other popular weapons, including the 
Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey helicopter and the Navy's F-14D jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate panel's work also gives considerable impetus to Cheney's request for 
full production of the B-2, which recently suffered an $800-million budget cut 
in the House Armed Services Committee. Some members of Congress are seeking to 
restore to the budget such items as the V-22 and the F-14 at the expense of the 
costly B-2 program. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Senate committee trimmed $300 million from the Administration's 
request for the B-2, Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said the cut would have no 
impact on the Pentagon's plan to purchase 132 of the new bombers. He indicated 
that the committee had viewed the $300 million as padding in the 
Administration's request. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Nunn, whose opinion carries great weight on Capitol Hill, gave the 
B-2 program a strong personal endorsement. He said the new bomber is necessary 
because the current-generation B-1 bomber cannot penetrate Soviet air defenses, 
as some had hoped it would. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sticker Shock' 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Nunn acknowledged that he sympathizes with B-2 opponents who 
claim the aircraft is too expensive. "All of us are undergoing some 'sticker 
shock' here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is now estimated that the B-2 program will cost the government $70 billion 
by the time the 132nd one has been purchased, making it cost about $500 million 
per aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn noted that much of the support for the B-2 hinges on the upcoming first 
flight test. Northrop Corp. is expected to fly the sophisticated, 
boomerang-shaped bomber for the first time within the next week, possibly as 
early as today. 
</P>
<P>
"If that plane doesn't fly, the debate is over," Nunn joked. "It is far too 
expensive to be a stealth taxi." 
</P>
<P>
Although the committee rejected a proposal by Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) -- a 
former test pilot and astronaut -- to withhold 1990 funding for the B-2 until 
the flight testing has been completed, the panel agreed to a compromise 
"fly-before-you-buy" policy proposed by Nunn and the committee's ranking 
Republican, Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The panel stated that none of the money contained within the 1990 budget for 
the B-2 could be spent until the bomber successfully completes its first flight 
tests, until it is certified airworthy by the Defense Science Board and other 
top officials and until Northrop has initiated testing of its capabilities for 
eluding radar detection. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, no more than 25% of the money can be expended before the secretary 
of defense reports on the results of the testing of its ability to elude radar. 
And the panel specified that future production costs of the aircraft may not 
exceed $295 million per bomber. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon already has spent a total of $23 billion on B-2 research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn acknowledged that B-2 supporters face "some real battles" in Congress 
later this year to protect the program against cuts proposed by supporters of 
other programs that were eliminated in this budget. "It's going to be very 
difficult," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Senate committee members supported Cheney's budget primarily because they were 
pleased with his willingness to eliminate some popular procurement programs, 
according to Nunn. He said it has been apparent for at least five years that 
such "hard choices" were necessary under the current budget restraints, but 
neither the Congress nor the Pentagon had been willing to make them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Secretary Cheney will be delighted with this action here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the committee provided no procurement funds for the V-22, which is 
being developed by Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Helicopters, it did add 
$255 million in research and development funds to complete the flight testing 
of the craft. Nunn said this was done because the committee believes there is a 
commercial market for the combination helicopter-airplane. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate panel also provided $4.5 billion for continued research on the "Star 
Wars" space-based missile defense system, or Strategic Defense Initiative, but 
that figure could be slashed by as much as $1 billion before the 1990 defense 
bill is enacted by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Star Wars' Cuts 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the House Armed Services Committee cut SDI funding to $3.8 billion and 
the figure is likely to be trimmed even more on the House floor. In the Senate, 
Nunn noted that chamber has only narrowly defeated drastic cuts in SDI in the 
last several years. 
</P>
<P>
Strong proponents of the program, such as Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), are 
fearful that supporters of the V-22, F-14 and other terminated programs will be 
trying to fund their programs by cutting SDI as well as the B-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration requested $4.8 billion for SDI in fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate committee's bill also places heavy emphasis on improving ordinary 
conventional equipment for American infantry soldiers, such as flashlights and 
electronic gear. Nunn said he has often heard from soldiers that their gear is 
not as good as the electronic equipment that can be purchased commercially. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Nunn said, the committee has instructed Pentagon officials to 
"occasionally stroll through Radio Shack and see what's available in the 
commercial world."

STATE ACTION COULD CLOSE KEY L.A. DUMP 
</P>

<P>
The state agency that regulates waste dumping has imposed restrictions on the 
operation of the Lopez Canyon Landfill where about 66% of Los Angeles' 
household trash is dumped. 
</P>
<P>
City officials predicted that the order could force the closure of the dump, at 
least temporarily, putting pressure on other dumps and forcing the city to use 
costly private landfills scattered around the county. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of the 7-0 vote by the state Solid Waste Management Board on 
Friday, a deputy Los Angeles city attorney said that on Monday he will seek a 
temporary restraining order in Los Angeles Superior Court to block the decision 
from taking effect at the East San Fernando Valley dump. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Christopher M. Westhoff said it will be business as usual at 
the dump Monday, but within about three weeks, the landfill would be 
"effectively closed by the action" unless the restraining order is granted. 
</P>
<P>
"This is tantamount to a disaster," Westhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
The board is holding the city to provisions of its 1978 state operating permit. 
The permit, according to state officials, says trash may not be piled higher 
than 1,725 feet, no more than 400 trucks a day may dump at the site and dumping 
may be done on only 140 of the 392 acres. Los Angeles, board members said, is 
violating all of those provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Between 6,000 and 7,000 tons of household trash is generated each day in Los 
Angeles. About 4,000 tons daily goes into the Lopez Canyon Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
But the state permit says the city may dump only 8,000 tons of garbage a month 
at Lopez Canyon. State officials concede that the figure might be a 
typographical error and on Friday limited the city to 3,100 tons a day at the 
dump. Westhoff said that "there is no official contingency plan because you 
can't plan for this." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Avila, president of the city Board of Public Works, said he believes 
that there is still operating room at Lopez Canyon. He said that with a 
temporary two-month shutdown, the life of the canyon could be extended for 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
Luther Derian, senior city sanitary engineer, said private landfills in and 
near Los Angeles probably could handle any overflow from Lopez, at least for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dumps listed by city officials as alternative dump sites are the 
county-owned dump at Calabasas and three private dumps: Sunshine Canyon 
Landfill above Granada Hills, Bradley West Landfill in Sunland, and a BKK Corp. 
facility in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
City officials pointed out that private landfills around Los Angeles are 
costly, charging from $19 to $23 a ton. Derian said that if the city loses 
Lopez Canyon, the fees might increase. 
</P>
<P>
In voting for the staff recommendation, E. L. (Skeet) Varner, a board member, 
told city officials that "your staff may not have intentionally violated the 
law, but obviously there's violation after violation" of the state permit to 
operate the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The city is defending its actions at Lopez Canyon by pointing to a 1983 Los 
Angeles engineering report, which it maintains allowed the city to dump up to 
4,200 tons a day and send 500 trucks daily to the facility. 
</P>
<P>
City officials argued that the provisions of that document are valid because 
the city, state and county have operated under its guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Conheim, counsel to the Solid Waste Management Board, said the city 
had failed to change its original operating permit, so the conditions imposed 
in 1978 should be followed. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who along with other area lawmakers 
vigorously criticized the city at the hearing, described the Solid Waste 
Management Board decision as "an important win, not just for the people who 
live around Lopez, but to everyone in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
"The city," he said, "has to abide by the law." 
</P>
<P>
Katz and others also questioned the city's right to dump on seven acres of U.S. 
Forest Service land next to the Lopez Canyon landfill. The city said that it 
has a valid permit from the federal agency to dump on the land. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the debate acknowledge that there is an approaching trash crisis 
as dumps fill up or restrictions are imposed on their operation. They also 
agree that a regional solution should be sought. 
</P>
<P>
But members of the Solid Waste Management Board said their focus -- at least 
Friday -- was limited to what the city is allowed to dump at Lopez Canyon under 
its state permit. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in nearby Lake View Terrace and Kagel Canyon have wanted the dump 
shut down. Their efforts intensified after a small section of the landfill was 
closed in March after two Los Angeles sanitation workers were overcome by fumes 
and hospitalized. But the state said at the time that it would not close the 
dump because only low levels of toxic substances were found during air and 
underground gas tests at the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez Canyon has caused one rift on the City Council. On Wednesday, 
Councilwoman Joy Picus asked the council to oppose the waste board's staff 
recommendation to restrict use of the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the East Valley district that 
includes Lopez Canyon, angrily chastised Picus for not consulting him first. He 
stormed out of council chambers before the vote, breaking the quorum so that no 
vote could be taken. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Solid Waste Management Board on Friday, Picus predicted the 
board's action "will force an upset in the current waste disposal practices 
within Los Angles County as a whole." But Bernardi, in a letter, urged the 
panel to impose the tough restrictions.

CLUB DOORS STILL ONLY SLIGHTLY AJAR

When Paulette Attie wanted to take a steam bath, a sign went up 24 hours in 
advance inside the venerable Beverly Hills Friars Club. 
</P>
<P>
The sign proclaimed: "Friar Paulette will be using the spa at 11 a.m. 
Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
At the assigned time, the New York singer, one of about half a dozen women 
members admitted to the formerly all-male club in the last two years, strode 
past the dimly lit Sleep Room where men wrapped in white sheets napped. She 
passed through the Card Room, where more men played poker in a haze of cigar 
smoke, and, for the first time, stepped boldly into the Spa Room. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Man in a Towel 
</P>
<P>
"There was a man there wearing only a towel, and as I went by he gave me a 
towel," Attie recalled. "I said, 'Thanks, you're a good sport.' He said, 'So 
are you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Armed with changing public attitudes, new laws and the occasional towel, 
hundreds of women like Attie are gaining membership to exclusive private clubs 
that they once could enter only as guests. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while significant numbers of clubs have opened their memberships to women, 
the doors have hardly been flung wide. Membership lists are still 
overwhelmingly male, some clubs have tried to keep certain sections off-limits, 
and others -- such as the most elite of clubs, the powerful Bohemian Club in 
San Francisco -- continue to refuse admission to women despite social and legal 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"Some might think that club membership is a trivial matter, but aside from the 
abortion rights issue, no other subject has generated the intensity of feelings 
that the club issue has," said Lynn Hect Schafran, an attorney with the 
National Organization for Women's Legal and Education Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"It's because some of these men club members really fear that they are giving 
up and in to women and that their lives will be destroyed. You can see it in 
the testimony, comments about how women have high voices and they would ruin 
the tone of the clubs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Barrier 
</P>
<P>
Gaining entrance to private clubs has enormous significance for women and 
minorities because they have stood as a last barrier against joining the upper 
echelons of society and business. Traditionally all-male clubs -- including the 
Cosmos Club in Washington, the California Club in Los Angeles, the New York 
Athletic Club in Manhattan and the Olympic Club in San Francisco -- have for 
years been hideaways where business deals are cemented and blue-chip 
friendships are made in the most genteel of settings. 
</P>
<P>
"When women are excluded from these informal centers of power, they are not 
seen as appropriate players in the formal centers of power," Schafran said, 
paraphrasing an oft-repeated maxim about clubs. 
</P>
<P>
As Richard M. Nixon, a longtime member of the Bohemian Club, said once: "Anyone 
can be President of the United States, but few have any hope of becoming 
president of the Bohemian Club." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court turned such clubs topsy-turvy, ruling that 
municipalities may force large private clubs to admit women and minorities. The 
justices said that clubs which serve meals and rent facilities to outsiders are 
more like business establishments than intimate social groups and therefore 
have no right to escape anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
The clubs argued that they were intimate and personal entities with a right to 
exclude others. But the skeptical court pointed out that the New York Athletic 
Club had more than 10,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
The New York City ordinance was significant because it mirrored similar laws in 
Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. The court had previously 
made a similar ruling regarding service clubs such as the Jaycees and Rotary 
Club. In California, the state civil rights act, which prevents businesses from 
discriminating, also applies. 
</P>
<P>
The battle to open club memberships in California began in the early 1980s, 
when the California Women Lawyers group tried to enact anti-discrimination 
legislation. Their efforts failed and the bill was not even given a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
It was the state Franchise Tax Board that finally made progress, forbidding 
individuals from taking business tax deductions for fees and expenses incurred 
at discriminatory private clubs. The Legislature then enacted similar 
constraints, and several local governments, including Los Angeles, followed. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, two years later, some maverick clubs still defiantly turn away women, 
forgoing business tax deductions to remain all-male bastions. Still others have 
admitted women but deem certain areas of the club off-limits. As a result, 
discrimination suits are becoming as much a part of the club scene as golf 
tournaments and power lunches. 
</P>
<P>
While many of the women members who have recently been accepted in these once 
all-male bastions say they have been treated politely, a few report that they 
have often been snubbed by other members and, in rare cases, even threatened. 
</P>
<P>
The state Franchise Tax Board has a list of clubs it believes are 
discriminatory and plans to spot-audit the 1988 state tax returns of members to 
see if business deductions were illegally taken. However, the board has refused 
to make the list public, citing the confidentiality of taxpayer records. 
</P>
<P>
"The battle isn't over," said Conway Collis, a member of the state Board of 
Equalization, who authored the tax deduction regulation. "The problem is now a 
few of the old clubs which are determined to be the last remaining dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
How many is hard to ascertain. In Los Angeles, the city attorney recently 
launched an advisory task force to check female and minority membership in 
private clubs. Hearings on the issue will begin this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Because they are managed so privately, there is still little known about these 
clubs, what their rules are, how many women and minority members they have," 
acknowledged Chief Deputy City Atty. John Emerson. "And the issue still remains 
that these clubs have to recognize that exclusion of people based on sex and 
race has no place in society." 
</P>
<P>
Membership lists are so private that the city attorney, suing the Jonathan Club 
for allegedly refusing women entry into its grill, had to use the courts to 
obtain statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Some clubs, such as the Los Angeles Athletic Club and the Regency Club, have 
long welcomed women. But others, including the Friars Club, Jonathan Club and 
California Club, saw the handwriting on the wall and began admitting a few 
women only as the city ordinance was about to be passed. While the numbers have 
been less than overwhelming, officials say that with attrition, more women will 
be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Racial discrimination is no longer the issue it once was, but there are still 
holdouts among the private clubs. The California Club admitted its first black 
members in 1988. But while few once-shunned groups -- mostly Jews, Latinos and 
Asians -- are now members, their numbers are generally higher than those for 
women, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles city attorney last year settled a lawsuit with the Brentwood 
Country Club to further integrate its dining areas and golf course. And the 
city is suing the Jonathan Club to integrate its men-only bar and grill. 
</P>
<P>
The club contends that while there is a "tradition" of preserving that area for 
men, women would not be turned away. But the club also filed a federal suit of 
its own against the city seeking to declare the city's ordinance 
unconstitutional. (The U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision left room for legal 
maneuvers in the area of right to private association under the First 
Amendment.) 
</P>
<P>
Still, Southern California clubs are thought to have a better admittance record 
than those in San Francisco. There, the Olympic Club, Bohemian Club and Pacific 
Club, continue to discriminate in major ways, according to city and state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Renne, city attorney for San Francisco, who filed suit against that 
city's 4,000-member all-male Olympic Club, said: "These men have failed to 
recognize that times have changed. They don't like change." 
</P>
<P>
She adds, however, that limited resources have prevented her department from 
taking a closer look at the elitist 2,300-member Bohemian Club. Founded in 1872 
, the club claims as members board chairmen and presidents of many of the 
country's biggest corporations, as well as a host of powerful politicians. 
Members include President Bush, former President Ronald Reagan and Henry 
Kissinger. The "Bohos," as they are nicknamed, are well known for their summer 
encampments where members cavort under the redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
Bohemian Club officials contend that since the club does not accept money from 
outside businesses, it is not subject to the court ruling. Members say it is a 
place not for business, but rather for camaraderie and literary and musical 
revues. 
</P>
<P>
Clubs that do admit women usually do not reveal just how many women members 
they have. Los Angeles city officials estimate that the 3,000-member Jonathan 
Club now has about 80 women members and that the 700-member Friars Club and the 
approximately 1,500-member California Club have about a dozen each. 
</P>
<P>
"Most clubs are practicing tokenism," said attorney Gloria Allred, who has 
filed suit on behalf of women at several golf and social clubs in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Allred herself became the first dues-paying woman member of the Friars Club in 
1987. Last year she filed a discrimination complaint with the state before she 
and other women members could use the club's spa. She won similar concessions 
at the New York Friars Club after being ejected when she tried to dine there -- 
even though that club has a reciprocal agreement with the one in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Allred also won entrance to the Friars Roast dinners, which feature jokes that 
the old guard deems "unfit for ladies." Allred said of the experience: "The 
jokes were awful. It was like entering another world." 
</P>
<P>
While many women are now entering that other world, many do not have total 
access because of club techniques that critics say are designed to discourage 
them. "In general, you can't walk into the office and pick up a membership 
application," Allred explained. "You have to be sponsored by several club 
members. Many women don't know who the members are." 
</P>
<P>
When Allred tried to get an application to the Bohemian Club, she was told she 
had to be sponsored by a member. "They didn't tell me who any of the members 
are. That's the old boy's club." 
</P>
<P>
She asked former California Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown for a membership 
application, but "I wouldn't give her one," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe women should be able to join men's clubs if there is business 
involved, but there isn't any at the Bohemian," Brown said. "I think she's a 
fine lawyer, but there are a lot of women's clubs she could join where they 
talk about sewing and raising babies." 
</P>
<P>
Brown added: "I love women, but I do think that men should be able to gather 
periodically without women around. Women wouldn't appreciate it, that we want 
to be able to pee on the redwood trees without walking a mile to a bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Business Deductions 
</P>
<P>
Richard Arnold, spokesman for the Bohemian Club, said that the club maintains 
its male exclusivity by its policy of not allowing members to take business 
deductions for club dues and expenses. "Our club motto is 'Weaving Spiders Come 
Not Here.' We don't do business at the club. It's considered distasteful." 
</P>
<P>
Women have not been admitted because "it's the general feeling among the 
membership that men be allowed to have their space," Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, David Daar, membership chairman of the Friars Club -- 
founded in 1947 by Milton Berle, Ronald Reagan and George Jessel among others 
-- said they are seeking "suitable" women members. 
</P>
<P>
"The evolution is slow," Daar said. "So far the numbers of women are small, but 
we are moving into the 21st Century along with the rest of the clubs and are 
pretty excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
Like many clubs, prospective Friars must be sponsored by a member and approved 
by the Board of Directors. The membership committee consists of seven men who 
interview prospective members. Under law, such clubs can be selective but not 
discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
"We still search for the right people, those we will have pleasure in 
associating with, people who will help our club move into the future," Daar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Membership in such clubs does not come cheap (some fees are more than $10,000). 
Some women who have been accepted say that they have been shortchanged in 
privileges. Others say they have had to pay more to join than men. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Bradshaw, an interior designer, paid $14,000 to join the Yorba Linda 
Country Club last year, then found that women did not have equal access to golf 
tee times. The coveted early morning hours on weekends and holidays were 
reserved for men. Women were relegated to the afternoons, when it is hotter and 
gets dark earlier. Women were also denied membership on the club's governing 
body. 
</P>
<P>
After Bradshaw filed a discrimination suit, she was considered a pariah, even 
by other women members, most of whom have access to the club because their 
husbands are members. 
</P>
<P>
"Only three women will play golf with me," Bradshaw said. "People turn their 
backs on me, they've torn the head off my pictures in the clubroom, scratched 
out my name on the handicap lists and spread vicious and false comments about 
my personal life. I've received death threats on the phone and nasty, anonymous 
letters." 
</P>
<P>
The women's association publicly denounced Bradshaw, saying that if she wanted 
to play golf during men's hours, she should "find a man" to play with. "Men 
work during the week, and so we make the weekends more available to them," said 
Gina Walthail, spokeswoman for the women's association. 
</P>
<P>
The club is owned by Santa Monica-based American Golf Corp., which runs 115 
clubs. General counsel Loretta Singer said that Yorba Linda is the only club 
with such policies. The rules were part of the purchase agreement. "We have 
asked them to change, but they refused," she said. George Atkinson II, a lawyer 
for the club members, said: "I don't want to discuss it. Negotiations are 
ongoing." 
</P>
<P>
Such constraints are common. At the Riviera Country Club, women cannot play 
until after 2 p.m. on weekends. At the Santa Ana Country Club, women cannot 
play until afternoon on Saturday. The Los Angeles city attorney recently sued 
the Brentwood Country Club to force more flexible hours for women, settling 
when the club agreed to lengthen hours. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 25 of the approximately 90 single women belonging to the Newport 
Beach Country Club sued the club alleging that they had to pay $8,500 more 
apiece for membership than single men. They also charge that single women must 
pay to bring male guests to play at the club, while male members often do not 
pay for guests. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the chicken wings that finally got to me," said Jackie Neal, one of 
those who filed the suit. "Men get free snacks in their locker room." 
</P>
<P>
Club officials refuse to discuss the issue. "There's nothing to comment on," 
club manager Jackie Morrissy said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of all these problems, women who have negotiated the hurdles say 
that the memberships are well worth it. They view the clubs as key places for 
socializing, discussing business and making contacts. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Lois Anderson Smaltz, who with aviator Brooke Knapp became the 
first female members of the Jonathan Club in 1987, said that she was royally 
welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose there were some old-timers who were upset and who have hard 
feelings," she said. "But I haven't run across it. People have gone out of the 
way to make me feel welcome." 
</P>
<P>
The dozen or so women who belong to the California Club say they feel at home 
there. Catherine Hagen, a partner in the law firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers, 
joined several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't play cribbage or poker, but I have the run of the whole building," she 
said. "I've never been denied entrance to any area, except maybe the men's 
room. I think now that the ice is broken and the men members see that it is 
beneficial to have women, the women membership will continue to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Marjorie Steinberg recently paid $4,000 to join the City Club on 
Bunker Hill, a new facility that welcomes both sexes. Former president of the 
California Women Lawyers Assn., she recalled when that group picketed the 
Jonathan Club 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We were considered shrill, mad women. Since then we have built a 
respectability for our position. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, some women are reluctant to join certain private clubs because of the 
history of discrimination. They think, why go where you weren't welcome, and 
probably still won't be? It's going to take a long time for women to join in 
substantial numbers to make changes at those clubs."

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa announced Friday he will support any candidate 
from the Communist Party coalition for the new post of president and urged that 
the vote be held right away. 
</P>
<P>
"I state that I will cooperate with any president elected no matter if it is 
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak or some other representative of 
the coalition, in order to solve Polish problems," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski, the leader of the Communist Party, announced June 30 he would not 
run, saying he was too closely linked with the martial law that he imposed in 
1981 to crush the independent Solidarity trade union movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sejm Due to Vote 
</P>
<P>
He recommended Kiszczak, the interior minister, but the Communist Party 
leadership has asked Jaruzelski to consider running. In recent days, especially 
after appearing frequently with President Bush during his three-day visit, 
Jaruzelski has emerged again as a likely candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The Sejm, or parliament, will elect the president, who will be responsible for 
the armed forces and foreign alliances. The post was created after talks on 
political and economic reforms between the government and Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Walesa said for the first time that Poland's internal and 
international situation requires that the president come from the Communist 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Be From Coalition 
</P>
<P>
"The president may be elected only from the party-government coalition. It 
results from Poland's internal and international situation," Walesa said. 
</P>
<P>
"The election of the president should be held immediately," he said. "Our 
country faces a great chance, but at the same time we have a constitutional 
crisis connected with a delay in filling the president's office. Extension of 
this situation causes additional dangers." 
</P>
<P>
Mikolaj Kozakiewicz, Communist speaker of the Sejm, said Thursday he wants to 
hold the joint vote of the Sejm and the new freely elected Senate to choose a 
president as soon as possible, preferably by July 22, Poland's national day.

SUPREME SOVIET APPROVES SECURITY CHIEF; REFORMS FOR KGB PROMISED

<P>
The head of the KGB, publicly grilled by lawmakers about the activities of the 
Soviet Union's super-secret security agency, pledged Friday to make it a more 
open organization, responsible to Parliament and fully observant of the 
country's laws. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir A. Kryuchkov won confirmation from the Supreme Soviet, the country's 
national legislature, as the chairman of the State Security Committee, as the 
KGB is formally known, but not before he underwent what he called "the most 
difficult examination in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Legislators, who for the first time are closely examining the qualifications 
and policies of government ministers before approving their appointments, 
questioned Kryuchkov for almost the entire morning about the KGB's past and 
present activities, demanding that he prove the agency no longer operates as a 
law unto itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Answerable in Forum 
</P>
<P>
And as Kryuchkov stood before the lawmakers, answering their questions and 
listening to their criticisms, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's political 
reforms took a significant step forward: For the first time in Soviet history, 
the head of the state security service had been made answerable in a public 
forum to a popularly elected Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov, 65, who has headed the KGB since last October after a decade as the 
deputy chairman in charge of foreign intelligence, did not always satisfy the 
legislators, as he sometimes sidestepped questions about past practices with 
broad promises of better behavior in the future. 
</P>
<P>
He drew a titter of laughter when he declared that the KGB does not tap 
telephones, maintain files on ordinary Soviet citizens or have more than a 
small number of "helpers" collecting information for it. 
</P>
<P>
There were many other frowns of frank disbelief and open murmuring among the 
lawmakers -- all shown in the lengthy excerpts broadcast on national television 
Friday evening -- as he dodged some of the tougher questions, including one on 
the KGB's budget and the number of its officers and men. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin on Attack 
</P>
<P>
In one of the sharpest attacks on the KGB during the session, Boris N. Yeltsin, 
the radical populist who won election to the new Soviet Parliament with a 
massive vote in Moscow, characterized the agency as busying itself with 
collecting "special information" on Soviet citizens through "an army of many 
thousands of informers," but unable to catch foreign spies. 
</P>
<P>
"In a period of democratization, this is not permissible," Yeltsin asserted, 
demanding that the KGB's power be sharply curtailed by dividing it into two 
agencies, one with responsibility for gathering intelligence abroad and the 
other, much diminished, to be in charge of counterintelligence and security at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB had done too little, Yeltsin contended, to reorganize itself for the 
new political era here and to break with the murderous purges its predecessors 
conducted for the dictator Josef Stalin in the 1930s and its persecution of 
dissidents from the 1960s into the 1980s under the late President Leonid I. 
Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB had done "great moral damage" to Soviet society, Yeltsin said, and 
Kryuchkov's answers, however pleasing they may have seemed, had been 
"insincere." 
</P>
<P>
But Kryuchkov, with his acceptance of full legislative supervision of the 
organization and his pledge of strict observance of Soviet law and 
constitutionally guaranteed rights, won confirmation with only six votes 
against him and 26 abstentions, including Yeltsin, from the 542-member Supreme 
Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most exciting moments of my life, both emotionally and 
politically," he said after the session, noting that the KGB for the first time 
in its history had presented a full report on its policies, activities and 
plans to Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who chaired the session, tried to speed the debate along and move to 
a quick vote, but members refused, demanding that Kryuchkov answer their 
questions and hear out their criticisms of an organization that only a few 
years ago was so feared that people would only whisper its name. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB has moved in recent months both to open itself to some public scrutiny 
in line with Gorbachev's broader political reforms and to improve its image, 
both at home and abroad. After a policy review in May, the KGB leadership 
announced its intention to speak more frequently and candidly about its 
activities, and the agency recently established an office to handle press 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
"We have covered only a half of the way," Kryuchkov said of his efforts to 
reform the KGB and encourage glasnost, or political openness. "But the Soviet 
people and the world public should know more about us. We want to show everyone 
that the State Security Committee, although it is not an ideal organization, is 
motivated by the most human goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a bitter past, but this is not only our past. It is the past of the 
party and of the country." 
</P>
<P>
"Truth and legality will remove even the shadow of 1937," Kryuchkov said 
Friday, referring to one of the worst years of the Stalinist terror. 
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the KGB's desire to take part in the rehabilitation of the 
victims of those bloody purges, which he described as "a crime against 
humanity" because of their brutality and scope. "Never again should this be 
allowed to happen." 
</P>
<P>
In other comments, he said that telephone wiretapping was limited to 
intelligence and counterespionage cases, that the KGB was now moving against 
organized crime and that 30 Western spies had been detected in the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Willing to Cooperate 
</P>
<P>
Questioned sharply by deputies about the recent development of nationalist 
fronts in most of the Soviet Union's constituent republics, Kryuchkov said that 
he was sympathetic to them and, despite considerable criticism by others in the 
leadership, saw them as more positive than negative. He denied assertions, 
common among conservative officials here, that they are creations of Western 
intelligence services. "They result from our own problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Soviet willingness to cooperate with Western intelligence 
agencies, notably the U.S. CIA, in combatting terrorism, organized crime and 
drug smuggling, noting that several joint operations had already been carried 
out to halt the flow of drugs and that information was being shared on 
potential terrorist threats, particularly one involving stolen enriched uranium 
to make an atomic weapon. 
</P>
<P>
All of the questions would be studied and given a fuller response, he said, and 
the KGB is resolved to cooperate with the Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would support new internal security legislation, a law spelling out, 
for the first time, the authority of the KGB and further guarantees of 
political and civil liberties. "The review of the KGB role in Soviet society is 
already in full swing," he said, and the new legislation would complete the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov also asked for legislation that would permit the KGB to open its 
archives, which contain millions of documents essential to understanding Soviet 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB's traditional secrecy, he continued, should be reviewed and relaxed, 
but it could not be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"If we tell everything about what we are doing, then we will probably weaken 
ourselves and strengthen those whom we must, unfortunately from time to time, 
try to counter," he said.

1 KILLED, 18 INJURED IN CLASHES OVER WATER, LAND RIGHTS IN SOVIET ASIA

Clashes among villagers over land and water rights have killed one person and 
injured 18 in a fresh outbreak of violence in Soviet Central Asia, Tass said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the villagers, armed with firearms and knives, fought 
pitched battles Thursday on the border between the republics of Kirghizia and 
Tadzhikistan. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the fighting, involving about 1,000 people across three border 
villages, erupted after Tajiks and Kirghiz disagreed about use of water and 
land in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Curfew Imposed 
</P>
<P>
It said a curfew had been clamped on the entire area and senior officials, 
including the Communist Party chiefs of both republics, had been dispatched to 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The violence occurred about 60 miles from the edge of the Fergana Valley in the 
neighboring republic of Uzbekistan, where clashes last month left more than 100 
people dead. The earlier clashes pitted native Uzbeks against Meskhetian Turks 
deported to the area by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Three people have died this week in clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh, a part of the 
republic of Azerbaijan, whose mainly Armenian population wants to join the 
neighboring republic of Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90 people died last year in Azerbaijan and Armenia in fighting over 
the territory. 
</P>
<P>
Unrest also broke out last month in the western part of the Central Asian 
republic of Kazakhstan, killing four people in the town of Novy Uzen in clashes 
between local residents and temporary workers from nearby regions.

NICARAGUA'S ORTEGA TO DISCUSS FOES' ELECTION DEMANDS

<TEXT>
<P>
President Daniel Ortega, acting at the behest of Latin American leaders, agreed 
Friday to open talks with all his adversaries in next year's Nicaraguan 
elections on their demands for legal and political changes to guarantee a fair 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega announced the decision in San Jose, Costa Rica, after a full day of 
talks with Oscar Arias Sanchez, that country's president. In doing so, the 
Sandinista leader reversed his position that Nicaraguan laws governing the 
elections and the news media are unalterable. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to open a dialogue with all parties that ratify their will to take 
part in the election . . . with the aim of strengthening the electoral 
process," Ortega told a joint press conference broadcast live in both 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Clear Away Suspicions' 
</P>
<P>
"In this way, we can clear away all suspicions" about the fairness of the 
elections "and weaken those who want to thwart (them) and deny Nicaragua 
peace," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican leader hailed the announcement as a "very positive and 
constructive step" to comply with Central American agreements he has promoted 
in an effort to end the U.S.-backed Contra insurgency in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is his readiness to start this dialogue, a dialogue that 
hasn't occurred in Nicaragua," Arias said. "This fills us with optimism." 
</P>
<P>
The decision was also urged upon Ortega by Venezuelan President Carlos Andres 
Perez, who met with him last week. Arias and Perez have been pressing 
anti-Sandinista parties to take part in the elections next Feb. 25, promising 
diplomatic muscle to keep them as clean as possible. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Friday's meeting, the 14-party Nicaraguan Opposition Union, the 
main anti-Sandinista coalition, formally committed itself to the race but 
insisted again on negotiating campaign conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the coalition's demands are suspension of the military draft, amnesty for 
several thousand anti-Sandinista prisoners, opposition control of a television 
station, several changes in the election law and "recomposition" of the 
five-member council that enforces it. The opposition accuses the council of 
pro-Sandinista bias. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega indicated that he will resist such sweeping changes. He said he is 
willing to make only "some adjustments and refinements" in the two laws enacted 
in April by the Sandinista-controlled National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
But by opening formal discussions, Ortega said he is seeking an "agreement" on 
electoral conditions. Before the current laws were passed, he consulted 
opposition parties one by one, then ignored most of their demands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talks to Start Soon 
</P>
<P>
Talks with the 14-party bloc and seven other opposition groups are expected to 
start before Arias and Ortega meet Aug. 5 with the presidents of El Salvador, 
Guatemala and Honduras to review progress on the peace accord they signed in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
That agreement said they would devise a plan by May 15 to disarm U.S.-backed 
Nicaraguan rebels in Honduras, in return for electoral guarantees in Nicaragua. 
But no such plan has been adopted, largely because of the Bush Administration's 
insistence on keeping the Contra forces intact through the elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration, echoing Nicaraguan opposition complaints, has accused the 
Sandinistas of violating their part of the peace accord and trying to rig the 
election process in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
As Ortega returned home Friday evening, Arias dined with Bernard Aronson, the 
U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, who is touring 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Without calling publicly for prompt disarmament of the rebels, Arias told 
reporters he would raise the issue with the American visitor in light of 
Ortega's new commitment.

Seven top officials in Cuba's Interior Ministry have resigned or been fired, 
the government announced Friday, one day after the execution of four military 
officers, thus providing the latest twist in the nation's highly publicized 
drug-smuggling and corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping changes at the ministry, which has been blamed for failing to 
uncover the smuggling operation sooner, were first disclosed on the front page 
of the official newspaper Granma following Thursday's execution by firing squad 
of Cuban war hero Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez and three others who were convicted of 
treason and other crimes in connection with the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the four who were executed, former Col. Antonio de la Guardia and former 
Maj. Amado Padron, were Ministry of Interior officials. Ten other ministry 
officials, including one woman, were also convicted in the case but given long 
prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'General Housecleaning' 
</P>
<P>
A Cuban official called the shake-up "part of a general housecleaning at the 
ministry." 
</P>
<P>
Granma said six resignations, which were handed in Thursday, were caused by 
"deficiencies committed by the (ministry's) leadership . . . which gave 
immunity" to those convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Four top Interior Ministry officials, including intelligence chief Gen. German 
Barreiro Carames, resigned along with two departmental deputies, Granma said. A 
seventh top official was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Barreiro was replaced by Maj. Gen. Jesus Bermudez Cutino, who most recently was 
intelligence chief of the Ministry of the Armed Forces. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Pascual Martinez Gil, the deputy interior minister, also stepped down 
and was replaced by Maj. Gen. Romarico Sotomayor, chief of staff of the Eastern 
Army, which has jurisdiction in the eastern third of the island. He is also a 
substitute member of the Communist Party's Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In a report by the Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina, in a dispatch 
monitored in Mexico City, Martinez Gil resigned "in view of the irregularities 
that occurred in this institution by a group of officers, activities that went 
unpunished for 2 1/2 years." 
</P>
<P>
The news agency added that both Martinez Gil and Barreiro "will be employed in 
other tasks" but gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
The four others who resigned were identified as Gen. Amado Valdez, chief of the 
border patrol; Gen. Miguel Bermejo Labrada, chief of the fire department, and 
Manuel Suarez Alvarez and Felix Veliz Hernandez, deputy chiefs of the 
ministry's political section. A seventh official, Brig. Gen. Roberto Gonzalez 
Caso, was fired as chief of immigration. Their replacements were not given.

Workers at a Roman Catholic convent on the edge of the Auschwitz concentration 
camp punched, kicked and dragged out an American rabbi and six students who 
occupied the grounds Friday and demanded that the nuns leave. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 people, including uniformed and plainclothes police, watched as the 
workers ripped up the demonstrators' signs and assaulted them. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Avraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, located in the Bronx 
section of New York, said members of his group suffered bruises, scrapes, 
bleeding noses and lips. Their clothes were torn and they were forced to leave 
the convent grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said that the nuns watched from a window and did not try to stop the 
workers. Reporters could see women inside watching, but they were not dressed 
in habits and appeared not to be nuns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extraordinary that in Auschwitz 50 years later, something like this could 
happen," said Weiss. "I demand an apology from these nuns." 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred five hours after the protesters climbed a 7-foot 
wrought-iron fence and occupied a porch of the convent, located in a former 
Nazi warehouse on the perimeter of the camp where 4 million people died from 
1940 to 1945, an estimated 2.5 million of them Jews. Many of the others killed 
at the camp were Christians. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss' group called the convent a "desecration" of the Jews' memory and 
protested the failure of Catholic authorities to meet a February deadline to 
relocate it. 
</P>
<P>
The group went to Krakow, about 30 miles to the east, but said they would 
return Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"What occurred today is going to strengthen our resolve all the more now," said 
Weiss. "People should understand what peaceful nonviolent protest is all about. 
I cannot accept that the nuns would be looking through the window and not help 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1987 Geneva accord, signed by 18 Roman Catholic and Jewish leaders, the 
cardinal was to transfer the 14 Carmelite nuns to an interfaith prayer and 
education center to be built farther from the camp. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy surrounding the convent has become more emotional since the 
deadline for moving the nuns passed on Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
The cloister is a few feet from the barbed wire fence and guard towers of the 
death camp. The convent lawn is a former gravel pit where political prisoners 
were gunned down by Nazi executioners in 1940 and 1941.

Gunmen burst into a meeting and assassinated Iranian Kurdish opposition leader 
Abdul Rahman Qassemlou and two other exiled Kurdish activists and wounded a man 
with an Iranian diplomatic passport, police in Vienna said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The murders were politically motivated," Police Chief Werner Liebhart told a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
He said the three killers, who later fled, burst into an apartment in central 
Vienna where the four men had held talks Thursday evening and immediately 
opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
Qassemlou, 59, was secretary general of the pro-Iraqi Democratic Party of 
Kurdistan. Also killed was his deputy, Abdullah Ghaderi-Azar, 37, and an Iraqi 
Kurd, Fadel Mala Mahmoud Rasoul, 38, who represented a separate Kurdish group, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth man, who held an Iranian passport, fled to the street outside the 
apartment with a gunshot wound in the jaw. He was hospitalized and unable to 
talk to police. 
</P>
<P>
There were no claims of responsibility for the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Iran Blames 'Enemies' 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Embassy in Vienna issued a statement Friday night that blamed 
"enemies of Iran" for the killings and said it had sent a delegation to meet 
with Kurdish leaders in Vienna to discuss "peaceful solutions." The Iraqi 
Embassy declined to comment on the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
In Iran, independent sources who declined to be named said Qassemlou, who has 
led the Iranian Kurds against Tehran for more than 20 years, had been 
negotiating a settlement with the new Tehran leadership that emerged after the 
death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini last month. 
</P>
<P>
Qassemlou's guerrillas seized control of a large part of Iranian Kurdistan 
after the 1979 Islamic revolution, but many were pushed across the border into 
Iraq after a massive government offensive in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
A total of at least 20 million Kurds are believed to live in Iran, Iraq, the 
Soviet Union, Syria, and Turkey.

BEIJING OFFICIAL CALLS FOR NEW PUSH TO FIND AND ARREST PROTEST LEADERS

A Communist Party official warned Friday that more than a month after the 
bloody military assault on pro-democracy demonstrators around Tian An Men 
Square, "counterrevolutionary" resistance persists, official Chinese newspapers 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of senior Beijing officials, Li Qiyan, the capital's Communist 
Party deputy secretary, called for fresh efforts to isolate and smash remnants 
of the democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
He said protest organizers are still at large "distributing anti-revolutionary 
rumor," despite a wave of arrests, and that "their capture is of vital 
importance to the survival of the party, the stability of the society and the 
fundamental interest of the people," according to a report in the official 
People's Daily. 
</P>
<P>
China has announced the capture of only six of 21 most-wanted student leaders, 
and several are believed to have escaped abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Chinese authorities, stepping up a campaign against Western 
influences, seized foreign newspapers and magazines from bookshops at luxury 
hotels in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Managers at 10 five-star hotels said agents of the Central Propaganda Bureau 
raided the bookshops and told the hotels that they would no longer receive 
foreign publications. 
</P>
<P>
"They even took away the shelves," said an assistant manager at the Great Wall 
Sheraton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, authorities ordered deluxe hotels to stop receiving satellite 
transmissions of foreign broadcasts and raided bookstalls selling the works of 
pro-democracy leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Western companies were largely absent from an 
international trade fair, touted as China's biggest ever, that opened Friday in 
Beijing. In contrast to previous such events, the United States, Britain, 
Canada, West Germany and France had only one booth each. Many Western countries 
imposed sanctions against China in protest of the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the official New China News Agency noted that 24 nations 
exhibited, and it said the "festive and friendly atmosphere at the fair did not 
seem to be affected by the martial law still going on in the city."

<P>
81-10 APPROVAL OF TOUGHER ECONOMIC SANCTIONS IGNORES ADMINISTRATION VIEW ON 
ISOLATING CHINA

Ignoring the Bush Administration's objections to further isolation of China, 
the Senate voted tough new economic sanctions Friday to punish the Beijing 
government for last month's bloody suppression of the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, co-sponsored by the Democratic and Republican Senate leadership, 
was approved by a vote of 81 to 10 -- far more than the two-thirds majority 
needed to override a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
Both California senators, Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Alan Cranston, 
voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would suspend for six months insurance and financing of 
American business in China by the U.S. government's Overseas Private Investment 
Corp. It would also bar indefinitely the use of foreign aid funds for 
China-related activities, block commercial contracts for Chinese space rockets 
to launch U.S.-made satellites, suspend licenses for export of crime control or 
detection equipment and ban nuclear exports to China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sensitive Technology 
</P>
<P>
The measure writes into law the ban on export of weapons, including helicopters 
and helicopter parts, that President Bush imposed by executive order 
immediately after the June 3-4 massacre in Beijing. It also requires the 
President to negotiate with other Western nations to prevent export of 
sensitive technology to China. 
</P>
<P>
The House passed a similar measure, 418 to 0, last month. The legislation was 
sent to a conference committee to reconcile minor differences between the two 
versions. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, where Bush is attending an international economic conference, White 
House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the Administration's position "is 
the same as it was toward the House-passed bill (which Bush opposed)." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe our policy is adequate," Fitzwater said. "We also have to be 
mindful of the long-term relationship (with China.)" 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said earlier that the United States and 
most of its allies agree it would be a mistake to adopt additional sanctions 
that would have the effect of isolating China from the rest of the world. At 
the same time, he said, it is too early to talk about lifting existing 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress clearly wants to go further than the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People's 'Concern' 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said the legislation "is 
designed to express to the government of China the concern which the American 
people feel about the continuing persecution of Chinese students and workers 
who support the pro-democracy movement." 
</P>
<P>
The bill, co-sponsored by Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), was attached as an 
amendment to legislation authorizing funds for the State Department. Passed 
after only 10 minutes of debate, the measure headed off even tougher sanctions 
proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the sanctions, the bill urges Bush to reconsider the extension 
of most-favored-nation trade status to China. The Administration renewed 
China's status in May, shortly before the crackdown on pro-democracy 
demonstrators in Tian An Men Square. Under the law, the matter need not be 
reopened until next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Be Lifted 
</P>
<P>
The legislation permits Bush to lift the sanctions if he certifies to Congress 
that China has made progress on a program of political reform or that it is in 
U.S. interests to end the measures. 
</P>
<P>
To lift the suspension of nuclear transfers, the President would also have to 
tell Congress that China has provided unequivocal assurances that it will not 
help any nation without nuclear weapons to acquire nuclear explosive devices or 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
In a non-binding section, the measure calls for suspension of loans by the U.S. 
government's Export-Import Bank to finance U.S. exports to China.

WATERLOGGED LOUISIANA GETS MORE RAIN, TRAPPING RESIDENTS IN HOMES

Storm clouds dumped 11 inches of rain Friday on waterlogged Louisiana, trapping 
dozens of residents in their homes and triggering floods that washed coffins 
out of graves in a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
The National Guard was sent in to evacuate about 75 people trapped in their 
homes by high water in St. Landry Parish. 
</P>
<P>
Up to five feet of water flooded homes Friday morning at Opelousas, La., where 
10 inches of rain fell. Authorities in Centerville measured 11 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Little Zion Cemetery in Opelousas said a number of coffins 
were washed out of graves. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of areas in the parish that were flooded," St. Landry Parish 
Sheriff Howard Zerangue said. "We had to evacuate a lot of people." Some people 
in the lower areas of the parish were stranded because of flooded roads. 
</P>
<P>
Lafayette, La., Police Chief George Armbruster said six inches of rain fell in 
a six-hour period, flooding roads and homes. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service reported that roads were flooded from Morgan City 
to Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
Classes at the University of Southwestern Louisiana and at public schools in 
Lafayette were canceled. The public library and its branches were closed. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, flash flood warnings were posted in parts of Oklahoma, where six 
inches of rain sent creeks and streams over their banks. 
</P>
<P>
The Weather Service said six inches of rain fell Friday morning south of 
Durant. Warnings were posted in Bryan County on the Texas border, and 
authorities in Calera, Okla., evacuated a nursing home because of the flood 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
Six inches of rain fell by Friday morning in the Oklahoma City area, 
forecasters said. Storms late Thursday caused severe street flooding in 
northwestern parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Deanne Loy said she was trapped atop her car in more than four feet of water 
until firefighters rescued her. She was not injured.

The B-2 stealth bomber may some day carry 25 tons of nuclear warheads but when 
the aircraft makes its maiden flight, it will carry a considerably less-lethal 
payload: thousands of commemorative lapel pins to be distributed to Northrop 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop, the prime contractor on the B-2 project, and its partners at the Air 
Force who are paying $70 billion for the bomber program, are rallying to 
promote the first flight of the aircraft for maximum political benefit amid a 
mounting controversy in Washington over its cost and need. It is making for a 
somewhat bizarre mix of high-technology aerospace and old-fashioned hype.

"This has generated as much hype as the Batman movie," said Rep. John R. Kasich 
(R-Ohio), who has fought to cancel the program. "Everybody wants to see if it 
will fly. Well, for the $23 billion we have already spent, it ought to fly." 
</P>
<P>
The bomber, a surreal looking craft designed to elude enemy radar with exotic 
materials and gently contoured surfaces, has undertaken two series of taxi 
tests this week at Northrop's plant in Palmdale and may attempt its first 
flight as early as today. The aircraft is expected to make a two-hour flight 
across the Southern California desert, reportedly accompanied by two F-16 jet 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Although critics are already discounting the importance of the first test 
flight, the event is generating considerable attention. Aviation enthusiasts 
have begun gathering in the baking Mojave Desert sun outside the gates of the 
Palmdale site, hoping to catch a glimpse of the distant bomber on the runway. 
Three Air Force generals will be on hand for the flight, as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AF Hawking T-Shirts 
</P>
<P>
And more than 100 news media representatives from around the world have staked 
out a prime viewing site adjacent to the taxi tests, watching the dark gray 
aircraft roar up and down the runway. Air Force officers have been hawking 
T-shirts with the B-2 emblazoned on the front to sometimes bored news reporters 
and photographers at the runway. One newswoman from the local Antelope Valley 
News used the long delays for the taxi tests Thursday as an opportunity to lie 
in a lawn chair and work on her tan. 
</P>
<P>
"The B-2 has gone from being the stealth bomber to being the public relations 
bomber," said Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, a watchdog 
group. "What is striking to me is that the Air Force has been more forthcoming 
on details of this aircraft in the last three months than it has been in the 
last six years." 
</P>
<P>
The current Pentagon funding crisis has pushed the art of public relations in 
the defense industry to new frontiers. When the Pentagon proposed canceling the 
Grumman F-14 jet fighter program, the company distributed to members of 
Congress "Top Gun," a hit movie that glorified the F-14. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, proposed funding has been restored for the F-14, in part, by 
diverting B-2 funds. One Capitol Hill staff member observed that the Northrop 
bomber has become a virtual funding reservoir for other programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clings to Its Mystique 
</P>
<P>
Northrop does not have any B-2 movies to counter its critics but it has the 
mystique of the stealth technology. And it is stepping up efforts to discuss 
the aircraft's capabilities and the manufacturing technology. The company even 
made B-2 executives available for interviews for the first time this week. 
</P>
<P>
In one of those interviews, Northrop deputy program manager David Van Buren 
earlier this week said that the B-2 had achieved a whole series of 
technological breakthroughs, including a sixfold reduction in errors in getting 
aircraft parts to fit together and a 62-fold reduction in setting up fabric 
laminations for plastic parts. 
</P>
<P>
The same message has been carried to Congress by Northrop lobbyists in numerous 
visits in an effort to save the program from potentially disastrous budget 
cuts. In a recent interview, Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones said the program 
could be crippled if it falls below the so-called minimum sustainable rate, in 
which the company would be unable to retain enough skilled employees. "It is 
down at that point where you could call it in a holding pattern," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costs Could Soar 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft will cost an average of $530 million each, but under one scenario 
presented to Congress, annual funding cutbacks and a production slowdown would 
boost that cost to $1.4 billion. A powerful House staff member notes that under 
current Air Force plans, about $48.7 billion will be spent on the bomber and 47 
aircraft built before testing is completed. 
</P>
<P>
But Van Buren insists that the B-2 has undergone extensive testing on the 
ground to reduce any potential risks and that the B-2 price is only $274 
million (excluding future inflation and development costs), which has changed 
little from estimates made a few years ago. He said that the B-2 takes fewer 
labor hours to manufacture on a "per pound" basis than the B-1 bomber or the 
Boeing 757 commercial jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
The hours per pound are not what concerns the Congress, however. It is the 
current budget that calls for annual funding of up to $8 billion for the B-2, 
more than any weapon has received in one year in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
The House Armed Services Committee has already cut $800 million from the B-2's 
1990 budget and committee staff say that much deeper cuts are likely once the 
funding legislation reaches the House floor. The program fared much better in 
the Senate, where so far it has been funded at the levels requested by the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call It a 'Validation' 
</P>
<P>
A successful first test flight is bound to do little to help the B-2, although 
an unsuccessful test could be catastrophic. Northrop officials have gone to 
great lengths to discount any uncertainty about the B-2. They don't even call 
it a test, instead referring to it as a "validation" of the previous ground 
testing that has occurred. Van Buren noted that the aircraft has gone through 
122,000 hours of preflight qualification testing. 
</P>
<P>
But first flights have been difficult in the past. 
</P>
<P>
When the F-16 underwent its first taxi tests in 1974, it prematurely lifted off 
the runway and nearly crashed. Films of the flight show the aircraft wobbling 
in a near stall and only slowly recovering. When the Air Force C-5A cargo jet 
made its first flight in 1968, a wheel fell off at the end of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Kasich, the Ohio Republican who wants to cancel the B-2, said he has little 
doubt that the B-2 will fly successfully, "but that should not mean much in 
this debate. They are trying to make it mean a lot because the plane is in 
trouble."

VAN DE KAMP PROPOSES BALLOT PLAN TO LIMIT LAWMAKER TERMS, FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bringing his campaign for governor to life after laborious weeks of planning, 
Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp made a leap for the high ground on government 
ethics Friday, proposing a ballot initiative to limit terms of state 
officeholders and the money that flows to them from special interests. 
</P>
<P>
He called state government a "swamp" of mighty special-interest influence. To 
clean it up, he said, taxpayers will have to pick up a share of the costs of 
political campaigns for the Legislature, the governorship and other statewide 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
His gameness in challenging the everyday conduct of government and the 
willingness to force politicians out of their offices after set terms add up to 
the most daring move of Van de Kamp's long and measured political career. 
</P>
<P>
It also is a step born of necessity. The two-term Democratic attorney general 
and former Los Angeles County district attorney is facing in-depth campaign 
polls that tell him Californians are not looking for status quo leadership in 
the 1990 race for governor but are hungry, as one adviser put it, "for someone 
to turn over the tables." 
</P>
<P>
This package could do precisely that, putting the two-term Democratic attorney 
general at odds with legislators and others officeholders in and out of his own 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a campaign about change," he said, as if delighted to have picked the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Important Issue 
</P>
<P>
The initiative also gives Van de Kamp -- ridiculed by rivals as a 
"John-come-lately" -- something strong to say on an issue destined to play an 
important part in the 1990 gubernatorial campaign debate: public disquiet about 
the integrity of government. 
</P>
<P>
Major provisions of the ballot proposition as sketched out by Van de Kamp at 
press conferences in Burbank, Sacramento and San Francisco would: 
</P>
<P>
* Impose California's first-ever limits on the consecutive years a person may 
hold a single office -- 12 years for the Assembly and Senate and eight years 
for statewide constitutional officers. The limits would not be retroactive. 
Instead, the clock would start as of the 1990 elections. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask candidates for the Legislature and statewide office to accept a ceiling 
on their campaign spending in exchange for public financing of approximately 
25% to 40% of their total political budgets. The exact ceiling on each race and 
the overall costs to taxpayers are still being devised. 
</P>
<P>
* Enact assorted other changes in ethics laws, including a ban on political 
honorariums and stricter conflict-of-interest restrictions on legislative 
votes. Future attorney generals would be empowered to appoint special 
prosecutors in some corruption cases. In addition, public officials, including 
legislators, would be banned from lobbying state government for a year after 
leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
"The plain truth is that we have allowed government and politics in California 
to sink into a quicksand of special-interest money," Van de Kamp said, reading 
a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet, we naively expect public officials to crawl through that swamp on a daily 
basis and come out clean. I'm here today to tell you that if we want clean 
government, it's time to drain the swamp." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp indicated that he will confer with public interest leaders to iron 
out details of the proposal and give lawmakers in Sacramento one last chance to 
take dramatic action on their own. Then he said he will proceed with a 
signature-gathering drive to obtain the 595,485 valid voter names needed to win 
the measure a slot on the November, 1990, general election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the ethics initiative came at a time when Van de Kamp's 
campaign, his status as the Establishment favorite for the Democratic 
nomination and his image as a "winner" are being called to question by party 
activists and even some of his own supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the spring and summer, Van de Kamp has felt pressure to engage more 
energetically in the 1990 campaign preliminaries. But he resisted, even as 
rivals seemed to be gaining at his expense. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general insisted on marshaling and developing an inventory of 
ideas in private consultation with his team of political advisers and at his 
own deliberate pace. Campaign manager Richie Ross quoted the lyrics of a 1960s 
rhythm-and-blues song to explain the virtue of Van de Kamp's slow but sure 
methods: "It's not what you look like when you're doing what you're doing. It's 
what you're doing when you're doing what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's proposal for a ballot initiative was the first of a series of 
announcements resulting from the planning sessions. The package of ideas 
eventually is supposed to provide the framework and rationale for Van de Kamp's 
gubernatorial bid. 
</P>
<P>
He began the sequence with ethics probably because he has been viewed, both by 
opponents and supporters, as increasingly vulnerable on the issue. This is not 
because of his own ethics, which so far as is known are untarnished, but 
because he is California's chief law enforcement officer at a time when the 
spotlight on government has come to rest on numerous political scandals. Van de 
Kamp, to the dismay of political supporters, has been only a bit player in the 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Both of Van de Kamp's leading rivals have already signaled their own strategies 
that recognize the public's growing doubts about the integrity of government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shaping Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco, is shaping her Democratic 
primary campaign to present herself as an outsider capable of restoring 
people's faith in government. 
</P>
<P>
As for Van de Kamp's initiative, Feinstein spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers dismissed 
it, saying, "Perhaps John Van de Kamp is hoping the public will forget the FBI 
had to come in and investigate corruption in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Republican candidate for governor Pete Wilson, in his second term as a U.S. 
senator, frequently draws a parallel between his career 18 years ago and his 
campaign now. Back then, he left a seat in the Legislature to take over as 
mayor of San Diego amid a corruption scandal there. Destiny now calls again, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
As for Van De Kamp, Wilson spokesman Otto Bos said: "He is going to have a 
tough time claiming leadership on this since there is nothing, zero, in the 
record. . . . Where's he been? He's really been a John-come-lately. 
</P>
<P>
"He has shown no reluctance to accept PAC money, special-interest money. He's 
taken gifts and trips from special interests. . . . The only constant has been 
his desire for public funds for campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction was predictably icy from state legislators, who were not consulted 
beforehand and who believe the 12-year limit on service is a gratuitous slap at 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"I just finished 12 years, and I feel better equipped than ever to represent my 
constituents," said Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), who wore a face as 
long as a loaf of French bread as he watched Van de Kamp's Los Angeles press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said the limit on legislative terms was the most difficult decision 
he had to make in drafting his proposal. He chose to proceed, he said, because 
"our system of government has hardened into a gridlock of caution, incumbency 
protection and the servicing of special interests. . . . This change is worth 
trying because what we're doing now isn't working."

STATE SUES TO KEEP TANKER VALDEZ AT LEAST 3 MILES OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state attorney general's office late Friday filed suit against Exxon Co., 
asking that the beleaguered tanker Exxon Valdez be prevented from entering 
California waters for repairs until state agencies are satisfied it won't do 
any harm. 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez, holding a position about 50 miles off the coast, continued on 
Friday to "burp" small discharges of a blue-brown substance from its stern 
side, but the discharges were intermittent and dissipated quickly, Coast Guard 
officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday the Coast Guard said tests showed both oil content and organic 
matter in samples taken from a Wednesday discharge from the tanker. Exxon 
officials maintain that the substance contains natural organisms, or algae, and 
has no oil content. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint in San Diego Superior Court seeks an injunction to temporarily 
block the tanker's expected passage into state waters, where the ship must find 
a protected area to remove five huge steel plates jutting downward from its 
hull. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we're taking action to protect California's coastline from Exxon's 
negligence and broken promises. As trustees for California's coastal waters and 
beaches, we cannot afford to take any chances with Exxon or the Valdez," said 
Gray Davis, state controller and a member of the State Lands Commission. 
</P>
<P>
That commission joined Atty Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and the Regional Water 
Quality Control Board in San Diego in requesting the injunction. The latter 
agency handles pollution concerns in San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Shipping Co. officials, informed of the state's legal action late 
Thursday, said it was too early to offer an official response. But a 
spokeswoman said President Frank Iarossi on Thursday had assured state 
officials that the ship would abide by earlier demands and "stay put" until 
given permission to enter state waters, which extend three miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday Mr. Iarossi reaffirmed our commitment that we would not bring it 
into state waters as long as the state agencies and the Coast Guard were not 
comfortable and had any concerns," said Exxon Shipping spokeswoman Jan Cool. "I 
don't know why the state feels like they need to file an injunction." 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez, which was towed from Alaska after hitting a reef March 24 and 
dumping 11 million gallons of oil in Alaska's Prince William Sound, was 
scheduled Tuesday to enter San Diego Bay for a $25-million, nine-month repair 
job at the National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. yard, where the vessel was 
built in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But the discovery Monday of the jutting steel plates, peeled back during the 
2,200-mile trip from Alaska, and mysterious slicks and discharges believed to 
be coming from the Valdez, have delayed its entry. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker now is languishing about 52 miles west of Point Loma. Officials say 
the discharge must be stopped before the ship can be taken to shallower, calmer 
waters to remove the plates, which would prevent the Valdez from clearing the 
harbor bottom.

BID TO EXCLUDE ILLEGALS FROM CENSUS HIT; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS SAY MOVE WOULD HURT STATE IN CONGRESS, CUT FEDERAL AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Public officials throughout California have condemned a U.S. Senate vote 
Thursday to exclude illegal aliens from the 1990 census, saying the action will 
shortchange California in Congress and possibly deprive the state of millions 
of dollars of federal aid for medical emergency services and other programs for 
poor people. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an outrageous piece of legislation and probably 
unconstitutional," Assemblyman Peter Chacon said Friday. Chacon, a San Diego 
Democrat, is the chairman of the Assembly's Elections, Reapportionment and 
Constitutional Amendments Committee. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Senate's action has created great confusion and stirred 
hopes, especially among urban Democrats, that it will be overturned by the 
House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Impact 
</P>
<P>
If it becomes law, the Senate's action could have a major impact on California 
and other states where the influx of illegal aliens significantly boosts the 
population and, thus, can affect the size of congressional delegations and the 
amount of federal aid that is doled out. With an estimated population of about 
28 million people, California is thought to have at least 50% of the nation's 3 
million to 8 million illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities on reapportionment have widely predicted that California would gain 
five to seven congressional seats as a result of population gains made during 
the last decade. But if illegal aliens are not counted, the experts say the 
state would not get one of the anticipated seats. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to tell exactly how many congressional seats California will lose. 
But we could have gotten six or seven additional seats and this could cost us 
one or two. It's possible," said state Sen. Milton Marks, a San Francisco 
Democrat who chairs the Senate's Elections and Reapportionment Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Funds Feared 
</P>
<P>
Jesse R. Huff, the state's financial director, said the state could lose as 
much as $300 million in federal aid that is allocated on the basis of 
population as determined by census counts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials said the measure could cut off federal funds for 
emergency medical services for illegal aliens. In the past, about $80 million 
annually in such services for illegal aliens has been paid out, with about half 
of that amount paid in Los Angeles County, according to Mark Tajima, a 
legislative analyst employed by the county's chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn described the Senate's vote as an attempt 
by "callous, self-serving interests in Washington, D.C., to deny representation 
and financial resources to minorities and underprivileged in our cities." 
Hahn's office said the city could lose at least $20 million in federal aid over 
the next 10 years -- money that goes for child care, housing rehabilitation, 
drug counseling and services for homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Immigration Law Overhaul 
</P>
<P>
The measure passed by the Senate was part of a larger overhaul of the nation's 
immigration laws that, if it becomes law, would place an annual cap of 630,000 
immigrants for each of the next three years and make room for more residents of 
Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill is expected to face tough opposition in the House, where states 
such as California, New York and Illinois with large alien populations have 
many votes. Moreover, a federal court in Pittsburgh ruled earlier this year 
that excluding illegal aliens from the census would be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the Senate's action were to become law, it is not clear how much 
impact it would have on federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the effect is going to be minimal," said Michael Myers, counsel to the 
House subcommittee on immigration and refugee affairs. Myers said the measure 
would prohibit aliens from receiving direct federal benefits, such as Social 
Security payments. But he maintained that such ineligibility is already written 
into a number of federal programs. Myers said that most of the assistance that 
states and cities now receive comes in the form of block grants that do not 
qualify as direct financial aid and, therefore, would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Puzzled by Action 
</P>
<P>
Still, many local officials remain puzzled by the Senate's action. 
</P>
<P>
Tajima said he was not sure whether programs such as foster care for abused and 
neglected children or Supplemental Security Income for aged, blind or disabled 
people would be vulnerable. "They all involve direct payments by the county of 
federal money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, with the second-largest illegal alien population in the 
state, officials warned that any effort by the Census Bureau to identify 
illegals would promote "fear and intimidation" among recent immigrants, both 
legal and illegal. Any such effort, officials said, would discourage people 
from participating in the census and even further reduce official population 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
"They counted them in 1980, and now for them to say they won't count them in 
1990 is ludicrous," said Angelo Doti, director of financial assistance for the 
Orange County Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is they are here. They're going to stay here. They pay taxes and are 
going to avail themselves of our services. We need to know the numbers. To not 
count them is to close our eyes," Doti said.

TERMS OF TIMBER CEASE-FIRE PROPOSED; 
</P>
<P>
PRESERVATIONISTS SEEK SMALLER HARVEST, MODIFY SOME DEMANDS 
</P>

<P>
Smaller harvests, stronger guarantees and cautious study were set by 
preservationists Friday as the conditions under which they would agree to a 
temporary cease-fire in the fight over Pacific Northwest timber harvests. 
</P>
<P>
Initial reaction from Congress was tentative disappointment. But the Oregon 
congressional delegation pledged to try to salvage efforts it began with Oregon 
Gov. Neil E. Goldschmidt to protect the timber industry from widespread mill 
closures and layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Industry groups, such as the American Forest Council and Northwest Forestry 
Assn., declined to comment on the preservationists' proposal until they have 
had a chance to study it more closely. 
</P>
<P>
Many timber sales have been blocked by court orders sought by preservationists 
to protect the northern spotted owl from extinction. A severe industry 
recession has been forecast for later this year by timber companies who say 
there are not enough saw logs to run their mills. 
</P>
<P>
To avert that problem, a compromise must be worked out between industry and 
preservationists by next week, when the Senate Interior Affairs Committee will 
mark up its portion of the 1990 budget bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Alter Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists said that, in exchange for several industry guarantees, they 
would modify or withdraw enough anti-logging injunctions to permit harvests of 
9.6 billion board-feet of timber in Oregon and Washington for 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
The harvest level suggested by preservationists is less than the 10 billion 
board-feet in a compromise fashioned in July by the Oregon delegation and 
Goldschmidt. Timber industry officials had grudgingly accepted that level. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Gorlin, an aide to Rep. Les AuCoin (D-Ore.), said the 400 million 
board-feet difference is enough to keep four large mills running for a year. A 
board-foot is an industry measure of lumber one foot square and one inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
Gorlin said she did not know if the industry would accept the additional 
reduction in cutting, but environmentalists seemed firm in their resolve to 
keep the reduction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still too high, but it is something we can live with in the 15-month 
cooling-off period," said Bruce Hamilton of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assurances Sought 
</P>
<P>
Among the assurances sought by preservationists are that no old-growth stands 
larger than 300 acres will be harvested, since they are thought to be prime 
habitat for owls. Smaller stands could be logged if studies showed that a stand 
does not house any owls and is not likely to benefit owls in the future. 
</P>
<P>
This is a concession by preservationists, who already have stopped logging on 
some stands as small as 40 acres. But it may not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure what that means, exactly, not sure what they are really 
offering," said Gorlin. "After all, this whole debate is not just a matter of 
supply (volume), but of certainty." 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists also balked at an industry request to give up the right to 
file new suits against timber sales. Preservationists offered to refrain from 
suing only if industry and government abide by applicable federal laws.

3 BUILDINGS LOST, 250 EVACUATED IN SOUTHLAND BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large mountain home and two smaller buildings were destroyed by a raging 
wildfire that blackened more than 1,400 acres and caused the evacuation of 
about 250 homeowners and campers from a rugged foothill area 10 miles west of 
Mt. San Jacinto. 
</P>
<P>
More than 600 firefighters from the state Division of Forestry and U.S. Forest 
Service battled flames in 100-plus temperatures and nearly impenetrable 
vegetation. They expected to surround the fire by daylight today. The blaze, 
which swept across the Poppet Flat area above Soboba Hot Springs in Riverside 
County, was believed started by sparks from a bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
The fire destroyed a $175,000 home in Poppet Flat and closed California 243 
between Banning and Idyllwild. Three firefighters were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, one of several fires caused the evacuation of about 200 
campers in Featherly Regional Park in Yorba Linda. There was no major damage to 
property but 30-foot-high flames blackened more than 200 acres and destroyed 
belongings of homeless people who camped in the park. 
</P>
<P>
Several miles east, Brea police evacuated residents from the River Bend 
Apartments, a 50-unit complex, when fire swept over part of the Green River 
Golf Course. Billows of black smoke from the blaze caused bumper-to-bumper 
traffic for several hours on the Riverside Freeway. Evacuees were allowed to 
return late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 3,000-acre brush fire on Camp Pendleton started by tracer bullets 
was contained. To the north, 1,500 firefighters dug in along the Little Sur 
River trying to complete a firebreak around the 3,100-acre Big Sur fire, which 
has been burning since July 8.

'NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To all you complaining groupies who whined about Chris Willman's insightful and 
perceptive article about the New Kids on the Block, congratulations. You have 
now proved that this group is truly a joke. If you think that thoughtless 
lyrics whined by a group of pubescent teens (who can't seem to find a real 
image) is music, well, wake up. 
</P>
<P>
Although I found your letters shallow and lacking insight, I do agree with you 
on one point: The group does not sound black. To say that it did would be a 
horrible insult to great musicians of the past and present such as the Four 
Tops, Chuck Berry and, more recently, Living Colour. 
</P>
<P>
Screaming groupies ought to stop drooling over Donnie's cute little "itsy-bitsy 
ponytail" and open their ears. I am certain they'd find that the music is not 
only unskillfully made but also quite annoying.

HOLYFIELD FACES ONE MORE OBSTACLE; 
</P>
<P>
IF HE BEATS BRAZILIAN, A TYSON MATCHUP SHOULD BE NEXT 
</P>

<P>
Only a glance at the heavyweight rankings is needed to show that there's just 
one heavyweight fight that will appreciably raise the pulse rate of the boxing 
public. 
</P>
<P>
It's Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
And this is the week Tyson-Holyfield should start coming together. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, in the great outdoors at Lake Tahoe, Holyfield is expected to clear 
what his promoter says is "the final hurdle" before Tyson, Adilson Rodrigues of 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
And Friday night, in Atlantic City, N.J., Tyson is expected to beat Carl (the 
Truth) Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"If Evander looks good against Rodrigues Saturday, I'll get together with Don 
(King) over the next couple of weeks, and start working on it 
(Tyson-Holyfield)," said Shelly Finkel, the New York rock music/boxing promoter 
who lately has been serving as a go-between for King, Tyson's adviser, and 
nearly everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the fight coming together in the first or second quarter of '90; it's 
too late for '89," Finkel said. "It looks like (Sugar Ray) Leonard will fight 
in November, so early '90 is a better bet at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield (21-0) bolstered his heavyweight credentials when he stopped Michael 
Dokes in a sensational bout in Las Vegas last March. Since abandoning his 
cruiserweight championships in April 1988, Holyfield had seemed competent but 
not inspiring as a heavyweight, beating James Tillis and Pinklon Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Dokes, a one-time cocaine addict who showed up at Caesars Palace 
prepared for the fight of his life. In what many are calling the best 
heavyweight fight of the 1980s, Dokes and Holyfield knocked each other all over 
the ring before Holyfield caught Dokes on the ropes in the 10th round and 
finished him. 
</P>
<P>
It was a night when a rich Tyson-Holyfield fight nearly fluttered away. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some bad moments in that fight, times when I wasn't sure what was going 
to happen," Holyfield said Thursday. "Then I said to myself: 'Wait a minute -- 
how can I possibly be a heavyweight champion if I can't win this fight?' So I 
reached down and did it. That's the only time you grow as a fighter, when you 
have to reach down deep." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, 26, who expects to weigh about 210 pounds for tonight's fight in 
Caesars Tahoe's outdoor stadium, is a heavy favorite against the 6-foot-3, 
225-pound Brazilian bricklayer who is 35-2 against an undistinguished list of 
heavyweights and who has fought outside of Brazil only once. 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues, 31, won a 10-round decision over James (Bonecrusher) Smith in 1987, 
went the distance against Alfredo Evangelista the same year, and needed all 10 
rounds to beat Tillis in March. Nevertheless, the World Boxing Council ranks 
him the world's No. 2 contender (behind Holyfield). 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield vows to hold up his end tonight, and assumes Tyson will do the same 
next weekend. "If Williams goes out there and fights the guy, shows some heart, 
he's got a chance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But if he just stands there, it's over. Mike Tyson has a way of intimidating 
guys in there in the sense that they don't perform up to their best. He makes 
them think in terms of looking good instead of winning the fight." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield's promoter, Dan Duva, will strive to make sure that promoter King 
doesn't drag his feet in locking up the Tyson-Holyfield matchup. King has 
dropped hints that he would like the Duvas (Duva's father, Lou, is Holyfield's 
trainer) out of the promotional picture before agreeing to a showdown. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, there has been some unhappiness in the Holyfield camp with the 
Duvas. Ken Sanders, Holyfield's Atlanta manager, was unhappy with the Duvas' 
involvement in the Tony Mandarich affair. The Duvas were sending up trial 
balloons over the notion of putting Green Bay Packer holdout Mandarich in a gym 
for a couple of months, and turning him into a possible Tyson opponent. 
</P>
<P>
This week, both the Duvas and Sanders have danced around the issue. Instead, 
Dan Duva seemed to be warming up for a war of words with King. 
</P>
<P>
"This is typical of how Don King puts together a fight," Duva said. "It's 
always misdirection, divide and conquer, posturing . . . it's just how he 
negotiates. He wants to get Holyfield as cheaply as possible. But he's worried 
because he knows if Tyson loses to Evander, he will have no ties to the new 
heavyweight champion."

DEFECTORS EXPOSE E. GERMAN DOPING; 
</P>
<P>
TWO FORMER SPORTS OFFICIALS DESCRIBE METHODICAL ADMINISTRATION OF DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two East Germans who were prominent in international sports before they 
defected to the West have provided accounts of life as athletes on the other 
side of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
For those who have suspected East Germany of creating Wunderkinder through 
manipulation, intimidation and chemicals, the resulting picture was as 
grotesque as they could possibly have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Even for those who want to believe that East German officials are no different 
than those in the rest of the world -- basically well-intentioned sportsmen who 
are battling long odds and expert pharmacists to identify and eliminate drug 
users -- the allegations by Hans-Georg Aschenbach and Hans-Juergen Noczenski 
must give pause. 
</P>
<P>
They have impeccable credentials. Aschenbach, 38, is a four-time world champion 
ski jumper and a gold-medal winner from the 70-meter tower in the 1976 Winter 
Olympics. Noczenski, former chairman of the East German judo federation, is the 
highest-ranking sports official from that country ever to defect. Aschenbach 
defected last August, Noczenski in February. 
</P>
<P>
They told their stories in an eight-part series that began June 25 in a West 
German Sunday newspaper, Bild am Sonntag, continued in the daily Bild and ended 
July 2 in Bild am Sonntag. 
</P>
<P>
Such West German tabloids use screaming headlines, numerous pictures, colorful 
writing and often titillating stories to please the massive audience that has 
made them influential. 
</P>
<P>
They are also staunchly anti-Communist and unflagging in their pursuit of 
unflattering stories about life in East Germany. Judging from their prominent 
play on the front page and the sports pages, the interviews with Aschenbach and 
Noczenski were major coups for the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Olympic Champion Divulges Biggest Sports Scandal; All East German Stars Doped; 
Also Katarina Witt," headlined Bild am Sonntag on the first day of the series. 
</P>
<P>
Bild am Sonntag said Aschenbach has "carried next to his heart a bomb. Now it 
has exploded." The newspaper later claimed that it had "ripped the mask from 
the face of East German sports," revealing what Bild called "a swamp of lies 
and cheating." 
</P>
<P>
But the West German newspapers were not alone in trumpeting the series. 
</P>
<P>
"The sports sensation of the year," the London Daily Mail called it. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the East German mask, Bild said, is a Draconian system that was designed 
in the '60s by Manfred Ewald, who recently resigned as president of the 
country's central sports organization, the DTSB, and approved by former East 
German leader Walter Ulbricht. 
</P>
<P>
Aschenbach's charges, which were supported by Noczenski, were that all East 
German athletes are force-fed performance-enhancing drugs, such as anabolic 
steroids, beginning as early as age 13 in some sports, including figure 
skating, gymnastics and swimming. 
</P>
<P>
Aschenbach is particularly qualified to address that subject because he became 
a doctor upon retiring as an athlete and was assigned to one of the sports 
schools for athletes with world-class potential. 
</P>
<P>
Aschenbach said the young athletes initially are told that the drugs are 
vitamins. Those who balk when they eventually learn the truth, he said, no 
longer are allowed to compete internationally, lose membership in their sports 
clubs and are harassed in their private lives. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations were not confined to drugs. Aschenbach said there are 
tremendous financial rewards for Olympic medalists. Bild reported that swimmer 
Kristin Otto, who won six gold medals at the 1988 Summer Olympics, received 
more than $130,000 from the government (about one-fifth of that in coveted 
Western currency), a Peugeot, a cruise with her boyfriend to Tunisia and 
Cyprus, a $5,000 clothing allowance and $2,000 for her trust fund so that she 
could retain her amateur status. 
</P>
<P>
But Aschenbach said that athletes also pay a high price. For every gold 
medalist, he estimated there are 350 invalids who have been victimized by the 
intensive training regimen that begins at age 13 or 14 in most sports. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that athletes are closely watched by the state police, who monitor 
their telephone calls and mail and maintain files regarding their personal 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Aschenbach was suspect, he said, because he dyed his hair blond and wore a 
rhinestone stud in an ear. A lieutenant colonel in the army, he said that he 
went years without an increase in pay or rank because his superiors thought he 
displayed bourgeois tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot listen to lies about East German sports anymore," he said. "People 
here and everywhere have a right to know what's really happening over there." 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans had their own version of what really happened in Aschenbach's 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Volker Kluge, the East German sports journalist through whom the DTSB often 
speaks, wrote that Aschenbach defected because he was under investigation for 
"medical manipulation" in connection with his role as the national ski jumping 
team's medical officer since March of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted East German sources who said Aschenbach was caught administering 
drugs, probably steroids, to eight ski jumpers early last year. 
</P>
<P>
But the sources also told Reuters that the articles in Bild and Bild am Sonntag 
had forced the DTSB to acknowledge for the first time that there is a drug 
problem among East German athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had cases of doping in (East Germany), cases where people wanted to 
get an advantage," one source said. "We have tried, however, to solve these 
problems internally. It may have been a mistake not to publicize these cases." 
</P>
<P>
That is consistent with the East Germans' request last November to join the 
proposed drug-testing agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. 
Under that proposal, U.S. doctors would verify testing of Soviet athletes and 
vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet and U.S. officials said earlier this year at a news conference that East 
Germany and other countries eventually will be included, but not until the 
initial agreement is in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Baaron Pittenger, U.S. Olympic Committee executive director, said the Bild and 
Bild am Sonntag series should make the USOC and the Soviets even more 
determined to see that the East Germans become involved. 
</P>
<P>
"(The articles) confirm the feeling that performance-enhancing drugs are a 
major problem of international sports," he said. "That doesn't speak to the 
accuracy of the stories. I don't want to make any judgments at all about the 
East Germans. But you have to have some kind of system where there is accurate, 
verifiable drug testing, and that is what we are in the process of developing 
with the Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
Since the series was published, two other former East German athletes, both 
defectors to the West, have made similar allegations to newspapers, one in West 
Germany and one in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Knacke, who in 1977 became the first woman to swim the 100-meter 
butterfly in less than one minute, told a newspaper in Vienna, where she now 
lives, that drugs, including steroids, were forced upon her by East German 
sports officials and destroyed her health. She also blamed the physical 
problems of her daughter, who was born in 1983, on the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, there is doping in East Germany, just as there is in the West," she 
told Kronen Zeitung. "But here (in the West), you have a chance to protect 
yourself against it." 
</P>
<P>
Aschenbach told Bild am Sonntag that winning the gold medal at Innsbruck in 
1976 was his greatest moment in sports, quickly followed by his most anxious. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were the worst hours of my life," he said. "I had won at the Olympic 
Winter Games on the small tower. Then the doping control. My God, what I went 
through. Will they catch you? Or was the timing correct once again? Was 
everything for nothing? Will you be the one they place the blame on, the idiot 
that is the butt of laughter for everybody? 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can imagine what you go through. You even forget that you have won." 
</P>
<P>
But only one East German athlete, a female shotputter, has ever been suspended 
because of a positive test for a banned substance at an international 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Noczenski described the precautions taken by the East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
"Every athlete gets off the drugs before the competition," he said. "Before he 
leaves the country, cars drive criss-cross through the country to collect urine 
samples. They are taken to the doping lab. Only he who is clean competes. He 
who isn't acts as if he is injured."

JACKSON HAS COME SO FAR, AND HE IS ONLY BEGINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL TANTON, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This whole, incredible Bo Jackson thing seems to have happened overnight. 
</P>
<P>
It's clear now that it is going to be with us for a long time, too, in some 
form or another. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't it just a year ago that Jackson came to Baltimore with the Kansas City 
Royals and all but embarrassed himself? 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't this the guy who couldn't judge a fly ball? Wasn't this the player who 
looked as if he'd set a major-league record for striking out? 
</P>
<P>
Didn't millions of fans shake their heads in dismay when Jackson announced 
during the 1987 baseball season that he was going to take up NFL football as a 
"hobby"? 
</P>
<P>
Nobody dares sell him short any longer. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, right now, is the biggest thing in sports. 
</P>
<P>
He is being called the kind of star who comes along once in a decade, and he's 
probably more than that. Who else has become a big star in both football and 
baseball? At the age of 26, he should only get bigger. 
</P>
<P>
When he won the Heisman Trophy at Auburn University in 1985, he proved he is a 
great football player. 
</P>
<P>
When he ran for a team-record 221 yards and three touchdowns in the Los Angeles 
Raiders' 37-14 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in 1987, he proved he could be 
an outstanding NFL back. 
</P>
<P>
And this week Jackson, the baseball player, burst into the national 
consciousness in one unforgettable night. He was the MVP in the All-Star game 
with a 448-foot home run, incredible base-running and a catch in left field 
that only a man with his fleetness of foot could have made. 
</P>
<P>
National Leaguers could hardly believe what they had seen. 
</P>
<P>
Said the Los Angeles Dodgers' Tom Lasorda, the National League manager: 
</P>
<P>
"The guy has incredible strength. He's a threat on the base paths. He has a 
chance to be one of the greatest ever to play this game. He's awesome." 
</P>
<P>
Said St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Vince Coleman: 
</P>
<P>
"When Bo hit that home run, we couldn't believe it. It was off a quality pitch 
by Rick Reuschel, down and in. Bo inside-outted it. You just don't see players 
hit that pitch that far." 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't Jackson's longest homer of the year. He hit one 450 feet off the 
Texas Rangers' Nolan Ryan. His first major-league homer, in 1986, was a 
475-footer off the Seattle Mariners' Mike Moore. 
</P>
<P>
In a masterstroke of timing, Nike premiered its new Bo Jackson ad campaign on 
the All-Star telecast, featuring some of the top names in sports (Michael 
Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
It was Jackson's night, all right, and we have only seen the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
He was the subject of the cover story in Thursday's USA Today. If the All-Star 
game had been played Monday night instead of Tuesday, Jackson would have been 
on this week's Sports Illustrated cover instead of a has-been like George 
Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
What's next for Jackson? 
</P>
<P>
Will he continue to play both pro sports? Or will he quit one and stick to the 
other? 
</P>
<P>
We're not going to find out for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is in an enviable position. He has a five-year, $7.5 million contract 
with the Raiders, and his three-year contract with the Royals, worth $585,000 
this year, runs out after the season. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's agent, Richard Woods, is talking about bringing in a Brinks truck 
after negotiating this next contract with the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Woods is too smart to hurt his bargaining power by revealing Jackson's future 
plans, even if Jackson knows what they are. Wisely, he will let baseball bid 
against football. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I think Jackson is crazy if he plays another football game. 
</P>
<P>
The man, through baseball and endorsements, is going to earn all the millions 
he could ever need. He has nothing more to prove in football. He already has 
shown he's big-time in that sport. 
</P>
<P>
A long time ago on a charter flight back to Baltimore after the Colts had 
played an away game, Gino Marchetti said something about football that has 
stuck with me. 
</P>
<P>
"In this game," he said, "one play can ruin your career. That's all it takes 
for an injury to finish you forever." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was tougher than Marchetti; nobody was more fearless. But even he played 
with that realization deep within his gut. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson would be foolish to risk a football injury that would finish him for 
baseball and all that goes with it; he is 6-feet-2 and a muscular 225 pounds, 
but even he is human. The body, it would seem, is not made to take the 
punishment of baseball and football together. 
</P>
<P>
The young man is on top and we can only admire him. He has proven a lot of 
doubters wrong -- and there were many, not that long ago, who said he'd never 
make it in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
There's not an athlete anywhere who could generate the excitement Jackson can 
at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, my baseball-mad 9-year-old son started out of the house barehanded. 
</P>
<P>
"Better take your mitt," I told him, "if you're going to be the next Bo." 
</P>
<P>
"There'll never be another Bo," he said with finality. 
</P>
<P>
"That," I told him, "is what they said when Mickey Mantle was around."

COMMERCIAL BOAT REPORTS TAKING ALBACORE OFF BAJA CALIFORNIA COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The albacore watch is apparently over, for now anyway. The popular, yet highly 
elusive, tuna have been located close to shore off the Baja California coast. 
</P>
<P>
The Molly N, a commercial bait boat en route to Cabo San Lucas to fish for 
yellowfin tuna, reported that it caught eight albacore on jigs about 190 miles 
south of San Diego and 25 miles off the Baja coastline, in an area called 
Geronimo. 
</P>
<P>
The fish were in the 12-pound range, but according to Ron Dotson of the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, their proximity to the coastline could be 
good news for the San Diego fishing fleet, which has experienced poor albacore 
seasons the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
"The water conditions seem to be good, and I see no reason why these fish can't 
move up the coast, which is what they normally do," said Dotson, an albacore 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Dotson warned, however, that the Molly N was just passing through and that 
there have been no reports on the size of the school, and therefore it is 
difficult to gauge whether there is reason for albacore fishermen to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman at Fisherman's Landing in San Diego said the Royal Polaris, which 
received the report from the Molly N and radioed the news back to the landing, 
had been fishing the Alijos Rocks farther south and was in the area Friday. The 
boat is due back in San Diego this morning. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman at H&amp;M Landing in San Diego said the Spirit of Adventure 
departed at 8 p.m. Thursday and will be searching the area. PETE THOMAS

that took them to the West German port of Kiel. Bild printed a photograph of 
the three walking away from the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Bild identified the three as Jens Koenig, 24; Andre Koehler, 24, and Thomas

PULLARD, FORMER USC POLE VAULTER, IS FOUND DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Pullard, 38, a former star USC pole vaulter who became a Los Angeles 
police officer, was found dead Friday in his Canoga Park apartment, the Los 
Angeles Police Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The death was reported to the coroner's office as an "apparent natural death," 
although a determination was not made as to whether an autopsy will be 
performed, coroner's spokeswoman Deborah Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
After Pullard failed to appear for work on Wednesday and Thursday, police 
officers were sent to his apartment Friday afternoon to investigate and found 
him dead, a police official said. There were no signs of violence or forced 
entry, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-year veteran of the force, Pullard had been assigned to the Van Nuys 
Division but was temporarily working for the department's press relations 
section. 
</P>
<P>
Pullard's 1969 vault of 16 feet 7 inches while competing for Los Angeles High 
School still stands as the City high school record, and at the time was the 
National Interscholastic Federation record. It also made him the highest black 
vaulter of all time outdoors. He went on to become a star at USC and later, in 
1978, became the first black vaulter to clear 18 feet. 
</P>
<P>
His best vault was 18 feet 1 1/2 inch in '78. 
</P>
<P>
Pullard was eliminated in qualifying for the 1972 Olympic Games but made the 
1976 U.S. Olympic team as an alternate, although he did not compete. In 1980, 
his Olympic hopes were frustrated by President Jimmy Carter's ban on U.S. 
competition in the Moscow Games as a protest against Soviet intervention in 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, at age 32, Pullard tried again. He came three inches short of the 
minimum vault required to qualify for the U.S. trials. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Pullard remained active in track and field, working with local 
clubs and coaching high school-age pole vaulters at Birmingham High School in 
Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Pullard was a rarity among pole vaulters on two counts, both as a black and 
because he was left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from USC in 1974, Pullard worked briefly with pole vaulters in 
Nigeria. When he discovered that the Nigerians did not have a pole-vaulting 
pit, he manufactured one out of 120 bed mattresses tied together.

WHEN OLYMPIC SPORTS BECOME AFFAIRS OF STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
East German leader Erich Honecker was so infatuated with figure skater Katarina 
Witt that he made it plain to the government-sponsored newspapers that they 
could gain favor with him by publishing her picture as often as possible. 
</P>
<P>
In their recent eight-part series on sports in East Germany, West German 
newspapers Bild and Bild am Sonntag also reported that East German government 
officials arranged several meetings between Witt, a two-time Olympic gold 
medalist, and ski jumper Jens Weissflog, an Olympic gold and silver medalist in 
1984, in hopes that they would fall in love, marry and bear athletic children. 
</P>
<P>
But Hans-Georg Aschenbach, an East German ski jumper who defected to West 
Germany last August, told Bild that Witt and Weissflog were not attracted to 
each other. Weissflog was engaged to another woman, and Witt lived with a 
drummer in a rock band. 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans have not had much success in the lonely hearts department. 
Swimmers Roland Matthes and Kornelia Ender, who, between them, won eight gold, 
six silver and two bronze medals in three Olympics, married in 1978. But, 
according to Bild am Sonntag, their model marriage soon dissolved. They had one 
child, who is mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that Ender, who was East Germany's most popular female 
athlete before Witt, later was banished to Suhl, a remote village in the 
country's southwestern corner. 
</P>
<P>
As an indication of the quality of life there, the joke in East Germany is that 
Suhl stands for Socialist Underprivileged Hinterland. That was Ender's 
punishment, Bild am Sonntag reported, for writing anti-government letters to 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
Ender is now married to a former bobsledder, who was identified as the 
ringleader after he and his teammates were involved in a scandal, Bild am 
Sonntag said. A search of the bobsledders' hotel rooms, which was ordered after 
they were seen attending a forbidden movie, "Rambo II," on a trip to the West, 
yielded Western currency, clothing, addresses and pornography. While the other 
bobsledders were reprimanded, Ender's husband was removed from the team.

THE SPARKS IN REP'S 'ORINOCO!' SPUTTER, FAIL TO IGNITE A FIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
In "Orinoco!" at the San Diego Repertory Theatre, Mexican playwright Emilio 
Carballido strands showgirls Fifi and Mina on a deserted boat careening down 
the Orinoco River, and sets them to thinking about where they are going, 
whether they will ever get there -- and if they really want to. 
</P>
<P>
This constant wondering recalls Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" (now 
playing at the Old Globe Theatre), in which the characters use their wait to 
question the nature of reality and their role in it. 
</P>
<P>
Like "Godot," "Orinoco!" is more than the story of its characters. It questions 
the future of Latin America itself. Where is it headed? Has the pilot 
figuratively left the ship, as he literally has in "Orinoco!"? Can this 
struggling part of the world, like these down-on-their-luck performers, take 
control of its own destiny? 
</P>
<P>
As such, "Orinoco!" is a thoughtful addition to the bilingual Latino play 
series that the Rep started with "I Don't Have to Show You No Stinkin' Badges" 
two years ago and "Burning Patience" last year. ("Orinoco!" will be presented 
in Spanish on July 19, 21, 22, 25, 26 and 29). 
</P>
<P>
But, despite its humor, spunk and richness of philosophical allusion, it is by 
far the least dramatic of the three. The pleasures of this two-woman play come 
in fits and starts, and director Jorge Huerta never quite coaxes the parts into 
a rhythm that flows. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some of the moments are well worth waiting for. There is an anecdote 
about flax blossoms, for example, that seems a poetic crystallization of the 
eternal dialogue between the two halves of human nature -- the one that sees 
the darkness foreshadowed in our final end, and the one that sees through the 
veil of our end, the light of our beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
Fifi, the showgirl who believes in the indomitability of life, tells the story 
of the blossoms, which fight against despair when the scissors cut them down by 
saying, "The best is yet to come." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the flax is woven into cloth that again seems doomed by the 
scissors ("Just like life," Mina says dolefully), and then finds itself 
transformed into beautiful linen shirts, then paper, then sparks that fly to 
the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge of two-person plays lies in whether the differences between the 
two spark change or simply cancel each other out. 
</P>
<P>
As touching as Ivonne Coll often is as the mournful Mina, she does not bring 
enough life to a role whose whole purpose seems to be to throw cold water on 
Fifi's dreams. The tempo sags to a stop when Jeannette Mirabal, as the brightly 
festooned Fifi, dashes off stage to check on a prospective lover or the 
temperature of the waiting champagne. 
</P>
<P>
What we see when Fifi leaves is a burned-out Mina just about to sputter out. 
What is missing are the glowing coals of Mina's former fire that Fifi is trying 
to fan into a flame again. 
</P>
<P>
D. Martyn Bookwalter's set, a curving ship, looks better than it plays. The 
women don't seem to have room to do much more than steer the wheel or dance on 
deck. It should be interesting to see how the set works when it's used again 
for "Thin Air," the world premiere of the Lynne Alvarez play that moves into 
the same design and space Aug. 8-27. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Nordyke's spare lighting fails to suggest the colors of the brilliant 
natural beauty that brings such joy to the women as they describe the sunrise. 
The resulting starkness of the surroundings sadly parallels the starkness of 
the drama on stage. Pretty as the sparks in "Orinoco!" are, they just don't add 
up to a fire. 
</P>

CONGRESSIONAL CUT STRIKES FEAR IN THE ARTS OF SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The House of Representatives vote this week for a $45,000 punitive cut in the 
$171-million budget of the National Endowment for the Arts sparked fear and 
anger in San Diego's arts community. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Woodhouse, producing director for the San Diego Repertory Theatre, called 
Wednesday's budget cut "outrageous, depressing and frightening." 
</P>
<P>
"The historical level of funding is already a sad comment on the lack of 
understanding of the role of the arts in a healthy, curious and forward-looking 
society," Woodhouse said. "For such a mature, sophisticated world power to 
consider reducing funding because of two artistic works that may have offended 
some people is a frightening act. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the dollar amount that's frightening. It's the motivation behind it." 
</P>
<P>
The House vote was precipitated by a furor over endowment grants totaling 
$45,000 to two touring art exhibits: a show of photographs including homoerotic 
and sexually explicit images by the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, and 
a show of works by award-winning artists that included an Andres Serrano 
photograph of a crucifix dipped in urine. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA awarded the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of 
Pennsylvania $30,000 to organize the Mapplethorpe exhibit, and $70,000 to the 
Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N. C., for an 
exhibit in which it gave Serrano a $15,000 award. Neither exhibit traveled to 
San Diego or Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In proposing the cut, Rep. Charles Stenhold (D-Tex.) called the move a 
"symbolic gesture" to punish the endowment for financing the Mapplethorpe and 
Serrano projects. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter voted for the cut, as well as for 
another unsuccessful proposal that would have reduced the endowment's budget by 
$14 million. An aide to Hunter quoted the congressman as saying he wanted to 
"knock some sense" and "instill discipline into those people who make the 
grants." 
</P>
<P>
Old Globe Theatre artistic director Jack O'Brien, who serves on the endowment's 
opera-music theater grants panel, said that anything that cuts or restricts the 
endowment "is visceral to me." 
</P>
<P>
"I sit with those panels of my peers and we make basically nominal 
contributions to the cultural life of the land and expect the community to do 
the rest," O'Brien said. "John Houseman told me once he thought it a miracle 
that the artists sit in judgment on each other, and in the entire history of 
the endowment, there has never been a scandal about the misuse of funds. 
</P>
<P>
"To make an issue of Mapplethorpe or (Serrano) is to denigrate everything that 
the endowment has done." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien portrayed the endowment's budget as "lamentably puny. (Congress is) 
acting as if we're being indulgent and wildly over-funded, and we have the 
crumbs from the national table to be able to feed our artists." 
</P>
<P>
Video artist Louis Hock of San Diego deplored the House action, noting that it 
points toward art by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
"You have got to figure that some exhibits will be for some audiences and other 
exhibits for other audiences," Hock said. "Although the NEA funds the arts for 
all citizens in the United States, it doesn't mean every work that the NEA 
sponsored will be liked by every citizen. If we have art by majority vote, 
there would be no black art because there is not a majority, and no Chicano art 
because Chicanos are not a majority, and no Eskimo art." 
</P>
<P>
The real issue, Hock said, is the religious right trying to impose its beliefs 
on a federal agency. In recent weeks Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.), with the support 
of conservative Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N. C.), Alfonse D'Amato (R-N. Y.) and 
Slade Gorton (R-Wash.), has demanded a written guarantee that the endowment 
deny federal funds to artwork that "would be blatantly offensive to the vast 
majority of the American people." 
</P>
<P>
To Hock, "that confusion of morality with the idea of public decency is a bad 
omen. It's essentially mixing politics and a religious attitude toward 
morality." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Nelson, a trustee of the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art and immediate 
past chairman of the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, aligned himself with the 
sentiments of a recent opinion piece about the Mapplethorpe-Serrano furor that 
appeared in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
"The person who wrote the Op-Ed piece felt that, when you ask someone to pay 
for the piper, you have to learn to dance to their steps," Nelson said. "I 
realize that public support for the arts is extremely vital, even though it's 
only between 7 to 9% of a group's budget. It doesn't mean that any group should 
skew their approach to react to that. But (that money) is extracted from all of 
us, and is for use under penalty of law. We all have to be sensitive to that. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, politicians and the public at large have to be sensitive to 
the fact that arts on the cutting edge are going to annoy some people because 
it's going to get them to look at themselves, their relationships to their 
family and community. That's what art is supposed to do."

CONSORTIUM TO BUY COOKE CABLE TV SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Billionaire Jack Kent Cooke on Friday agreed to sell his Woodland Hills-based 
cable television system with 675,000 subscribers to a consortium of six 
companies. A similar deal had fallen apart in March. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke, whose businesses include the Daily News in Woodland Hills and the 
Washington Redskins football team, did not reveal the sales price of Cooke 
CableVision and sister company 1st CableVision. But cable industry analyst Paul 
Kagan in Carmel said he had heard estimates of $1.6 billion, or $2,400 a 
subscriber, which is in line with previous cable sales. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Cooke lost out in the bidding for Rogers Cablesystems. At 
that time, Cooke said cable systems were overpriced and that he planned to sell 
his holdings, Kagan said. The consortium members include Intermedia Partners of 
San Francisco; Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver; TCA Cable TV Inc. of Tyler, 
Tex.; Falcon Cable TV of Los Angeles; Chambers Communications Corp. of Eugene, 
Ore.; and a group controlled by the John Rigas family of Pennsylvania. Two 
members of the original consortium, Hawk Cable and Rock Associates, had dropped 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke and the consortium had struck a tentative agreement in January to sell 
the system for an estimated $1.5 billion, or $2,300 a subscriber. But Cooke 
pulled out of the deal apparently because Centel Corp. had just sold a cable 
system that fetched about $2,400 a subscriber, according to Kagan. 
</P>
<P>
After the sale, which must receive federal approval, Cooke's system will be 
split among consortium members.

PENTAGON LIFTS BAN ON TELEDYNE ELECTRONICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The ban on new government contracts slapped on Teledyne Electronics six months 
ago for its role in the massive Pentagon procurement fraud "Ill Wind" was 
lifted Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A Teledyne spokesman said the ban, imposed by the Defense Logistics Agency and 
in effect since Jan. 11, had caused "a serious disruption" in business at the 
Newbury Park subsidiary. However, he said the company had not attempted to 
quantify its lost business opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated $223.2 million worth of military work under way at the subsidiary 
when the ban was imposed was unaffected. Other Teledyne divisions were also not 
affected. The electronics division, which employs 500 of Teledyne's 44,000 
workers, has annual revenue of $75 million, virtually all of which is 
defense-related. The entire company last year had total revenue of $4.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
On March 23, Teledyne pleaded guilty to two charges stemming from the 
government's investigation into massive fraud surrounding the bidding on and 
awarding of Pentagon contracts. The company was fined a total of $4.36 million. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said private consultants, retained by defense contractors 
such as Teledyne Electronics, bribed government employees for information that 
gave their clients an edge in winning contracts. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Teledyne, prosecutors said the company and three of its managers 
agreed to pay defense consultant William E. Parkin $160,000 to assist them in 
obtaining Navy contracts handled by Navy electronics engineer and procurement 
specialist Stuart E. Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Parkin, Berlin and Woodland Hills consultant Fred H. Lackner, who also was 
involved in steering contracts to Teledyne, have already pleaded guilty to 
charges stemming from the investigation. Parkin and Berlin were sentenced to 26 
months in prison and fined $25,000. Lackner is awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
The three Teledyne Electronics employees went to trial. Two, George H. Kaub, 
vice president for contracts at the Newbury Park unit, and Eugene R. Sullivan, 
former comptroller of the unit and now assistant controller at the Teledyne 
Ryan Electronics unit in San Diego, were found guilty of wire fraud and 
conspiracy. Dale Schnittjer, vice president for finance at the Newbury Park 
unit, was acquitted.

SOME EMPLOYEES PUSHED TO WORK NEW BANKERS' HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bankers' hours have gone the way of teller's cages and green eyeshades, many 
employees of major financial institutions are learning. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo this week notified 5,500 branch employees that they must be willing 
to work evenings and Saturdays or look for another job. Other major banks that 
have opened their branches on Saturdays and stayed open later on weekdays for 
the last few months said they have been able to cover the extra hours with a 
combination of volunteers and mandatory assignments. 
</P>
<P>
The longer hours are largely the result of intensified competition that has 
emerged in recent months among the state's big banks. Wells initiated the move 
to extend hours, which traditionally were 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
All of the banks report enthusiastic customer response to the foray into 
Saturday banking, a territory that savings and loans had controlled for years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the retail business," Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kim Kellogg said. "If 
you work for Macy's or Nordstrom, you have to be willing to work weekends." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Wells has been relying on volunteers to work evenings -- the branches 
have been open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. since April -- and on Saturdays but now 
wants to start a more formal scheduling system, Kellogg said. 
</P>
<P>
An employee will not be asked to work every Saturday, when the branches are 
open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., and the bank will continue to allow employees who 
work the four hours on Saturday to take off an entire day during the week, 
Kellogg said. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg said the bank is trying to be sensitive to employees' objections. Those 
who decide to quit will be given counseling and help in finding new jobs as 
well as paid leave ranging from one to three months. 
</P>
<P>
At Bank of America, spokeswoman Cynthia Kasabian said: "Pretty much, we have 
been able to handle it on a voluntary basis, but that doesn't mean we wait till 
Saturday for people to volunteer." The bank assigns people to work when there 
are not enough volunteers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific uses a combination of volunteers and scheduled employees, said 
spokeswoman Deborah K. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate has been rotating Saturday duty among teams of employees, some 
of whom prefer to work Saturdays, said Joe Bernhardt, vice president and 
district manager of the Orange County and Inland Empire divisions.

ONLY MAJOR ISSUE UNRESOLVED INVOLVES FINANCING SYSTEM

<P>
House and Senate members working on legislation to rescue the savings and loan 
industry settled a procedural feud Friday, moving significantly closer to a 
comprehensive plan that will include tough financial standards for thrift 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
House members had been irritated and surprised by the Senate's offer Thursday 
of an overall package deal to replace the agenda of negotiations on each issue 
involved in the bailout. But the House conferees pondered the Senate proposal 
Thursday night and decided that they liked it because it accepts many details 
in the House version of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The positions of the two legislative chambers are very similar on the 
"overwhelming majority" of issues, House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. 
Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said. The two sides are "so close on everything," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
The sole major unresolved dispute involves the financing system, with the 
Senate and the Bush Administration favoring creation of a new agency that will 
issue bonds excluded from the federal budget. The House wants to get the funds 
through the sale of Treasury bonds, which are included in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not very far apart," said Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. 
Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). But he noted "a basic difference on the funding issue." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said House staffers will develop a detailed counterproposal over the 
weekend to offer the Senate. House conferees will consider their plan Monday 
and offer it to the Senate on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Capital Issue Discussed 
</P>
<P>
After conferees exchanged compliments on the new-found spirit of cooperation, 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) said: "We're all happy we agree; let's get to 
work." Members of the conference applauded. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting Friday dealt exclusively with the issue of capital -- that is, the 
amount of money to be put up by S&amp;L owners as the financial underpinning of 
their thrift institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The House members took tough elements of both bills to assemble a proposal on 
capital standards for submission to Senate negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of S&amp;Ls would be required to furnish $3 in capital for every $100 in 
loans made by the institution. If the owners put their own funds at risk, the 
legislators believe, they will be less likely to make loans on risky or dubious 
business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
The latest proposal, offered Friday by the House, says the owners must put up 
cash equal to 1.5% of the loan portfolio by June, 1990, en route to the 
standard of 3% by 1995. For now, the other 1.5% could come from such intangible 
items as goodwill, the value of an institution beyond its financial holdings 
and physical assets. 
</P>
<P>
The intangible category also includes the value of mortgage-servicing activity, 
which consists of the fees earned for collecting monthly payments from 
homeowners and other borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Tough Controls 
</P>
<P>
Under Friday's proposal, an S&amp;L calculating capital toward the 3% rule 
could include the value of mortgage-servicing rights it has purchased, but the 
fees on mortgages it already holds could not be included. This would prevent an 
S&amp;L from counting fees on some loans that may have gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;Ls unable to meet the capital standards would face the imposition of 
tough controls by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The use of junk bonds remains an unresolved issue, because the House bill would 
prohibit such investments entirely for S&amp;Ls. The Senate proposal, by 
contrast, would permit an S&amp;L to have up to 6% of its assets in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
After Friday's session, negotiators expressed confidence that they could finish 
work on the bill early next week.

FROM SURF TO TURF: RIPTIDES KEEP LIFEGUARDS IN THE SWIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Santa Monica lifeguard Lewis Chao knew that he had another rescue on his hands 
Friday when he saw the two boogie-boarders drifting out to violent seas. 
Moments later, a five-foot breaker slammed into 15-year-old DeWayne Pryor, 
tossing him off his board, while his uncle, Jeff Crawford, paddled futilely 
against the riptide that had swept the two into deep waters. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got another," Chao said as he and partner Kurt Fry, flinging their red 
lifeguard cans, ran toward the two swimmers. Fry guided Crawford out of the 
current while Chao pulled Pryor to shallow water. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like something was just sucking me in," said a shaken Pryor of Van Nuys 
as he toweled off the sand from his chest. "We were not in any trouble, but I 
couldn't come back." 
</P>
<P>
Chao smiled at the comment as he returned to his lifeguard's tower, a stone's 
throw away from the Santa Monica Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuing swimmers has been routine work for Chao and other Los Angeles County 
lifeguards during the last week. And county officials say heavy surf, which 
pounded Los Angeles County shores earlier this week before subsiding 
considerably Friday, has contributed to an 85% increase in the number of 
lifeguard rescues this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"They (rescues) are coming in 
</P>
<P>
bunches," chief lifeguard Howard Lee said on Thursday. "Surf's up and it's one 
busy year." 
</P>
<P>
Through July 12, lifeguards made 4,725 rescues, compared to 2,549 by the same 
date last year. County officials said the figures jumped after five- to 
seven-foot surf lashed county beaches from Sunday to Thursday. The high surf, 
weather experts said, was caused by a storm in the Southern Hemisphere two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'That's High' 
</P>
<P>
"We are at least three times . . . busier than last year," said lifeguard Lt. 
Russ Walker of Zuma Beach, where lifeguards rescued 194 endangered swimmers 
during the five-day period. "That's high considering we just have a handful or 
none on some days." 
</P>
<P>
At Santa Monica Beach, lifeguard Lt. Randy DeGregori said, "At some periods we 
were having multiple rescues, and our men were in the water every 10 minutes or 
so." 
</P>
<P>
While some lifeguards blame heavier surf and larger beach attendance, weather 
experts said the surf is not much higher than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"From our observations, this is really not an exceptional year," said 
oceanographer Richard Seymour, who has been measuring waves on the West Coast 
for UC San Diego's Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla for the last 
13 years. "Other social factors may be responsible -- like inexperienced 
swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riptides Normal 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it could be that the riptides are coming at crucial periods when there 
are lots of people at the beach," said Mike Frazer of the Santa Monica patrol. 
"Like when more people are on the beach -- the Fourth of July when we rescued 
more than 200 people." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said it is normal for West Coast beaches to experience riptides during 
the summer. The riptides result from winter storms in the Southern Hemisphere. 
Swells created by the storms lash West Coast beaches, creating holes in the 
beach floor. When the backwash heads to sea, the current intensifies in the 
damaged areas, creating problems for unsuspecting swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards spot riptides by looking for discolored and violently disturbed 
water. They advise swimmers in trouble to swim parallel to the shore to get 
away from riptides, instead of trying to struggle against them. "Many of them 
panic and that is when we go in for them," DeGregori said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Need to Be Active' 
</P>
<P>
But despite the busiest summer in recent years, lifeguards say they are not 
complaining. "Only when we make a few rescues do people realize our usefulness. 
We need to be active. We don't like looking like policemen," Chao quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Temkin, a lifeguard at Zuma Beach, agreed, but added, "Yeah, everybody is 
thankful except the 6-foot, 200-pound jock type who feels embarrassed by being 
saved in front of the girls."

COURT COURTS HOMELESS VETS -- UNDER A CANOPY, GRAFFITI 
</P>

<P>
San Diego Municipal Court will convene today in special outdoor session on a 
racquetball court, where the judge, bailiff, clerks and lawyers will wrangle 
over the criminal cases of homeless veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Believed to be perhaps the first time in the nation a county court has set up 
shop solely to deal with the criminal problems of one segment of society, the 
court will meet for one day only on a racquetball court at San Diego High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about an El Cajon ax murder here," said organizer Robert Van 
Keuren, executive director of Vietnam Veterans of San Diego. "We're talking 
about sleeping in public, jaywalking, public trespass, the types of tickets 
people get when they're homeless because they have no place to go. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dealing With Barriers 
</P>
<P>
"Then you rack up the failure to appears," Van Keuren said. "You're not going 
to appear in court when you've got no money to pay. . . . These guys have a 
fear of the court system, a fear of appearing in court. If they want to get a 
job, this is one more barrier that stands in the way of them getting back into 
the mainstream. So we're actually going to have a court to try to deal with 
this barrier, among others." 
</P>
<P>
Judge E. Mac Amos Jr., Municipal Court presiding judge, agreed to dispense 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard of situations where you might set special sessions for groups of 
cases," Amos said. "If you had a large group of protester cases, for instance, 
you might set a special session. But I've not heard of a situation like this 
being set up, for veterans, especially under these circumstances, so I think it 
is unique." 
</P>
<P>
About 45 deputy prosecutors and public defenders have volunteered to join Amos 
and court personnel in handling the cases, said Jay Wentz, a lawyer and head of 
the county Bar Assn. committee on the homeless. Defense attorneys met Friday 
with more than 80 veterans who are ready to face their back charges, said Steve 
Binder, a deputy public defender. 
</P>
<P>
One was Bob Brower, 28, who said he's been homeless for "a long time." 
</P>
<P>
"I got a bunch of illegal-lodging citations, traffic tickets, jaywalking," 
Brower said. "I hope this works because this lady's helping me get my driver's 
license, get back on my feet. But I can't do it until I take care of these 
things." 
</P>
<P>
James Brown, 48, who said he had spent the last two years homeless in San 
Diego, wanted to take care of "a couple" back tickets for drinking in public 
and "five or six" citations for riding the San Diego Trolley without paying. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a court here is a fine idea to take care of these things, a good idea, 
having them come out here to us this way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Amos will officiate from behind a folding table and under a blue-and-yellow 
canopy draped over the top walls of the racquetball court. Defendants standing 
at a lectern in front of the table will be able to read a handwritten sign hung 
Friday on the court's back wall announcing Amos' name. Or they can turn to a 
side wall to see the graffito, "Maria 'n' Frank 6/24/89." 
</P>
<P>
Although Amos will only hear misdemeanors, sentencing for those found guilty 
will call for alternative thinking, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's jails are "severely overcrowded," Amos said, adding that "many of 
these people don't have any money, so the imposition of fines doesn't make much 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the guilty ones may see "public work service" -- digging up weeds and 
picking up trash along the roads or volunteering with a church or service 
group, Amos said. 
</P>
<P>
"Public work service -- hey, I'd do that, yeah," said Tom Wilson, 38, who said 
he had been homeless since last summer. Wilson said he had "about five" tickets 
for jaywalking, illegal lodging and no-pay rides on the trolley. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try to get them all thrown out, though," Wilson said. "I sure 
ain't got the money to pay them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stand Down' Encampment 
</P>
<P>
The court is the centerpiece of a three-day "Stand Down" encampment, a tent 
city designed to provide legal, housing and health counseling for homeless 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one-stop shopping for homeless vets, that's the idea," said Van Keuren. 
The event will end Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In military parlance, a "stand down" is the rest period after combat. The 
"Stand Down" project was designed to give homeless vets three days' respite 
from the streets and access to social services so that they can "learn to help 
themselves," Van Keuren said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are about 5,000 homeless people in San Diego County, according 
to Frank Landerville, project director of the Regional Task Force on the 
Homeless, the camp and court are only open to homeless veterans, which number 
about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's camp drew 500 vets. This year's was expected to draw 600, Van 
Keuren said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the court session, about 55 lawyers were available Friday -- and 
were scheduled to volunteer throughout the three-day program -- for counseling 
on divorce and child custody matters, evictions, consumer issues and government 
benefits, said Dan Stanford, a San Diego attorney coordinating the civil side 
of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Problems that couldn't be solved on the spot were to be referred, among other 
sources, to "Project HELP," a homeless assistance program being staffed by 150 
law clerks serving summer internships at area firms, Stanford said.

DAIRY CLEARED OF LIABILITY IN 1985 LISTERIOSIS CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court jury Friday found that Alta-Dena Certified Dairy 
will not have to share financial liability for nearly $100 million in unsettled 
claims filed by victims of a listeriosis epidemic that killed 48 people and 
sickened hundreds of others in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In an 11-1 verdict reached after 3 1/2 days of deliberations, the jury spurned 
arguments by now-defunct Jalisco Mexican Products Inc. of Artesia that raw milk 
supplied by Alta-Dena to make cheese was infected with listeria bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the Lord has answered our prayers," said Alta-Dena founder Harold 
Stueve, 71, in a brief telephone interview. "We had nothing to do with this 
case in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'On Cloud Nine' 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Raymond A. Novell, who represented Alta-Dena in the case, said: "This 
was strictly an issue between two companies. Jalisco looked around for deep 
pockets and sued us. . . . I'm on cloud nine." 
</P>
<P>
Gary McPherson, former owner of Jalisco, would only say: "We lost. We will 
finish settling." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the verdict may have extinguished chances that families of those killed 
and children born with birth defects will receive full compensation for their 
injuries, said Kim Miller, an attorney for more than 100 plaintiffs who watched 
the case from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised that it came out this way. We really believed that the milk 
contained the bacteria when it left Alta-Dena," Miller said. Now, she added, "a 
lot of the significantly injured plaintiffs will have to take small 
compensations. There will not be enough funds to properly compensate these 
victims from Jalisco or its insurance proceeds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Small Insurance Policy' 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the problem is that "Jalisco had a small insurance policy to begin 
with -- about $10 million -- almost three-fourths of which has already been 
depleted in settlements of claims." 
</P>
<P>
An investigation led by researchers from the federal Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta counted 142 cases of listeriosis between Jan. 1 and Aug. 15, 
1985. The deaths included 20 fetuses, 10 newborns and 18 adults. 
</P>
<P>
McPherson and cheese maker Jose Luis Medina both pleaded no contest in 1986 to 
misdemeanor criminal charges. They were sentenced to 30 days and 60 days, 
respectively, in Los Angeles County Jail. They were fined a total of about 
$48,000. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the trial, presided over by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard 
Lavine, Jalisco attorney Roy Brisbois used expensive models, video 
presentations and testimony from medical and food scientists to prove that the 
cheese was infected by Alta-Dena's unpasteurized raw milk. 
</P>
<P>
Brisbois' direct evidence of a link between the milk and epidemic, however, was 
based largely on the fact that the same strain of bacteria that contaminated 
the cheese was found after the outbreak in a carton of Alta-Dena sour cream 
taken from a truck at a local dump. The same bacteria turned up in a sample of 
caseinate -- which is used to make sour cream -- taken from an Alta-Dena 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
The same strain of bacteria was also found in body fluid taken from an elderly 
man who consumed only Alta-Dena raw milk before he died of cancer in 1982. 
While the incident occurred three years before the listeriosis outbreak, health 
officials said it constituted direct evidence to back up the discovery of 
listeria in the carton of Alta-Dena sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
"The only common link is the milk. . . . It's the only explanation that makes 
sense," Brisbois insisted in final remarks to the jury. "I'm asking you to 
agree with the best scientific minds in the government that we are right." 
</P>
<P>
But Novell, in his final remarks, called Brisbois' evidence "the three sows' 
ears of epidemiology" and blamed the epidemic on "filthy conditions at the 
Jalisco plant." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that listeria was never detected in milk produced by Alta-Dena's 
herds. Between Dec. 1, 1984, and June 30, 1985, Alta-Dena also supplied 26 
million gallons of milk to 30 customers. Only Jalisco had a problem, Novell 
said. These facts weighed heavily in Alta-Dena's favor during deliberations, 
members of the jury said. 
</P>
<P>
Said juror Dina DiBella, 27, of South Gate: "There just wasn't enough evidence 
to prove that the milk was contaminated before it got to the Jalisco plant." 
</P>
<P>
With the trial over, Stueve -- who sold Alta-Dena in February to the American 
subsidiary of a French firm -- said he and his two brothers plan to devote 
their time to producing and distributing Stueve's Natural raw certified milk.

ALLSTATE'S DROPPING OF SMALL GROUP HEALTH COVERAGE STINGS MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing a liver transplant operation that will cost at least $140,000 and 
possibly much more, Grayce Aul, a Canoga Park housewife, has lost her regular 
health insurance policy, one that would have given her nearly full coverage. 
</P>
<P>
All she has been able to obtain in replacement is a conversion policy that 
provides bare-bones coverage, including a basic $100-a-day hospital benefit and 
a maximum surgical benefit of a little more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
It was not her illness that led to Aul losing her regular policy. The loss was 
due to a decision by Allstate Life Insurance Co. to stop selling health 
insurance to 14,000 small groups, averaging just three people each, including 
the one to which Aul belonged. The consequences of that decision were that Aul, 
along with others in these groups who were very ill with continuing diseases, 
could not obtain any other adequate insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The case illustrates the plight that critically ill people can fall into 
through no doing of their own, and of one of the many gaps that exist in 
American health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The facts of the Aul case were confirmed by Aul herself, her physician, Stephen 
A. Borowsky of Northridge, and by executives of Allstate Life who were 
interviewed at company headquarters in Northbrook, Ill. They add up to what may 
be a choice between an early death or poverty for a woman and her husband who, 
in their 50s, are financially well off now. 
</P>
<P>
Aul and Dr. Borowsky are both active in the United Liver Assn., a Southern 
California support group for victims of liver disease. Its officers report that 
insurance problems plague many of those facing high expenses as a result of 
required operations and recuperative drugs and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"They're facing the fact they have an incurable illness, their ways of living 
have changed, and they have all these physical and psychological stresses, and 
added to them are the insurance problems," said Kathleen Memel, a Beverly Hills 
psychotherapist who moderates support groups for the association and is a 
member of its board. "We hear about them constantly." 
</P>
<P>
Aul agreed to have her name used and her situation checked with her doctor and 
her insurer. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think it's fair to pull the rug from under me," she explained. 
"We paid high premiums for years before this happened and so have thousands of 
others. I'm not alone. There must 
</P>
<P>
be many others wondering just as I am today what's going to happen to them." 
</P>
<P>
Aul had been insured since 1981 under a small group policy carried through her 
husband's business, Aul Pipe &amp; Tubing Inc. of Vernon. The policy benefits 
were generous, the coverage comprehensive and there was originally no limit on 
the amount the insurer would pay during the policyholder's lifetime. Nine 
people were covered under Aul Pipe &amp; Tubing's group plan, and premiums last 
year ran a total $5,345 a month. 
</P>
<P>
But on Feb. 17, the Aul firm received a 90-day notice of termination from 
Allstate. 
</P>
<P>
"The group insurance industry has experienced rapid changes over the last few 
years, principal among those changes being the development of managed health 
care programs," said Allstate's letter. "We do not currently have a managed 
care program to offer to our group insurance customers, nor does our volume of 
business warrant the extensive investment that would be required in order for 
us to develop an effective program. We have, therefore, regretfully decided to 
withdraw from the group insurance market. In order to effect this withdrawal, 
we are terminating existing policies." 
</P>
<P>
One of those covered under the Aul firm's policy died of cancer before the 
policy's cancellation date, and another person covered has diabetes. Six others 
covered were generally healthy and were quickly able to obtain another 
comprehensive health insurance policy. Mrs. Aul represents the ninth person who 
was covered under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
But Aul -- who has been ill with primary biliary cirrhosis for seven years and, 
according to her doctor, would have about five years life expectancy without an 
eventual transplant -- said she and the other women with pre-existing disease 
could find no company willing to sell them comprehensive coverage. They had to 
settle for the conversion policy Allstate was required to offer by law. 
</P>
<P>
On May 8, Aul received another letter from Allstate. "Congratulations!" it 
began. "Your request for conversion of your Group Health Insurance has been 
approved with an effective date of May 1, 1989." Her premium was $1,520 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Aul purchased the coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"But this policy was almost nothing," she told The Times. "Its hospital benefit 
of $100 a day (for a maximum 70 days) is only a tiny fraction of what a daily 
hospital stay costs. And it leaves almost all the cost of a transplant to me." 
</P>
<P>
"The actual average of a single transplant is about $140,000 or $150,000," said 
Dr. Borowsky. "Sometimes it doesn't take, and the patient needs to go for 
another one. And then there may be complications. I've heard of a total price 
of $380,000. And then there is post-care for 10 or 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
Post-operative medication alone would cost Aul at least $1,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, Borowsky said, "I don't think anyone will sell her a 
(comprehensive) policy." 
</P>
<P>
Allstate officials wouldn't, as they made clear in comments that were 
considerably more pointed than the language of the Feb. 17 termination letter. 
</P>
<P>
"People who are insurable will not take conversion policies," said David 
McPherson, executive vice president for administration at Allstate Life. "Only 
the uninsurable will, and the cost of insuring them is enormous. To keep the 
price down, the states have decided the minimum package is all that is 
required. The policy we offered Mrs. Aul complied with state law. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that people like Mrs. Aul have a problem, but we can't offer her 
more than other people in her class." 
</P>
<P>
McPherson and Robert Seiler, senior vice president and general counsel of 
Allstate Life, said that Allstate decided to drop its small group policies as 
part of a general move out of the health insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
Rapidly escalating medical costs, and a continuing inability to control them, 
as well as a general assessment that the federal government is apt to create a 
national health insurance system sooner or later, helped convince the company 
to sell all its group policies, they said. 
</P>
<P>
They did not say that Allstate had been losing money on the policies, but they 
said future trends were not promising. 
</P>
<P>
"We realistically don't know if there's any way you can control costs short of 
national health insurance," Seiler said. He said it would have cost anywhere 
from $100 million to $300 million for Allstate to have established a HMO, a 
managed care program, and even that might not have worked to successfully 
control costs. 
</P>
<P>
So, the executives explained, Allstate sold all its large group policies to 
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. But, they said, Metropolitan was not interested 
in buying the 14,000 separate small group policies. Allstate was left with 
those. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to exit, terminate our (small group) contracts," McPherson said. 
"And the law requires that you treat everybody the same." 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive, however, to the plight of Aul and other uninsurables, the Allstate 
officials said, they and other insurers have been supporting creation of an 
"uninsurables pool" under which a state or federal mechanism would spread the 
risk of insuring such people to the insurance industry as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixteen states have authorized such pools," McPherson said. "In California, 
the enabling legislation was introduced but not approved." 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, legislative consultants said that in 1986 and 1988 bills were 
actually passed that would have established such a pool, but that in both 
instances they were vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian on grounds that the 
benefits were too extensive and could be a drain on state tax funds. 
</P>
<P>
New legislation is pending this year and, this time, the consultants said, 
Deukmejian aides have suggested certain cost safeguards that, if adopted, would 
result in Deukmejian signing a bill creating such a pool.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 ARRESTED AFTER COVERT INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five employees of a Ford Motor Co. subsidiary in La Mirada have been arrested 
on drug charges after a three-month undercover investigation, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Four men and one woman who worked at Predelivery Service Corp. were booked for 
investigation of narcotics sales over the last two weeks and released, a Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were identified as Juan Abreau, 36, of Buena Park; Rose Armenta, 
33, of La Mirada; Domingo Bastanchury III, 42, of Chino Hills; David Estrada, 
45, of Anaheim, and Guy Grahados, 32, of Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials initiated the investigation with the Sheriff's Department, 
said Robert Garber, the firm's manager. Sheriff's narcotics detectives also 
worked with private investigators who made undercover drug buys in the plant, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The plant, which employs about 120 people, prepares Ford automobiles for 
delivery to dealerships. The five employees arrested have been fired, Garber 
said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GIVING OUT LEAFLETS IN SHOPPING MALL OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A West Los Angeles anti-nuclear group has won a court order allowing it to 
distribute information to patrons of shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California called Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin's ruling "a victory for freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
Lewin granted a preliminary injunction that bars mall owners from preventing 
individuals or groups from entering a mall "simply to hand out information or 
talk to patrons," ACLU officials said. The ACLU had sued Culver City's Fox 
Hills Mall on the anti-nuclear group's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Westside SANE/FREEZE were prevented from distributing information 
decrying nuclear testing by a policy that prohibited advocating political 
issues in the mall -- with the exception of voter registration or circulation 
of ballot petitions, ACLU officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin reaffirmed on Wednesday a 1979 decision "which recognized that today's 
shopping malls are yesterday's town squares," said ACLU attorney Robin Toma.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRED SECRETARY RETURNS WITH A GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A secretary who had been fired from her job at a Century City law firm returned 
with a gun Friday but surrendered without incident after a lawyer coolly 
excused himself and summoned authorities, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Rone Ellis, about 35, was booked at the West Los Angeles Division on suspicion 
of assault with a deadly weapon. Detective Steve Osti said Ellis readily 
complied when officers ordered her out of a 34th floor office at Sidely &amp; 
Austin, 2049 Century Park East. 
</P>
<P>
Managing partner Charles Vogel said Ellis told police that she was "just trying 
to scare" those in the office. "Well," Vogel added, "she succeeded. It was a 
good act." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis was fired on Wednesday for a reason Vogel declined to discuss. He said 
the North Hollywood resident returned about noon Friday, went to the office of 
Rex Beaber, sat at the attorney's desk and said she wanted to talk. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a moment and I'll continue that thought with you," Vogel quoted Beaber as 
saying just before leaving the office to summon help. 
</P>
<P>
Other employees were evacuated while waiting for police to arrive. They were 
back to work by 1:30 p.m., Ellis said.

DIVER SNARED BY LINES ON TRAP DIES

<P>
A 15-year-old Malibu scuba diver died despite doctors' efforts to save him 
Friday night after he became snagged in underwater lines and ran out of air 
while apparently trying to free lobsters from a trap off the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Robert McLaughlin was reportedly near death when he was flown by a Navy 
helicopter to Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks after the 
diving accident Thursday. A hospital spokeswoman said he died at 6:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Coast Guard, McLaughlin and a diving partner, Sara Graves, 18, 
were diving in 60 feet of water in Fry's Harbor off Santa Cruz Island when he 
became entangled in the lobster lines and ran out of air. 
</P>
<P>
After trying to keep McLaughlin alive by sharing her own dwindling oxygen 
supply, Graves rose quickly to the surface to summon help from the crew of a 
Santa Barbara diving and pleasure boat, the Vision, that they had helped 
charter. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Fritzler, one of the boat owners, said McLaughlin and Graves belonged to a 
29-member group called Malibu Divers, which is connected with a scuba shop in 
Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"They were both apparently low on air, and he was attempting to release some 
lobsters when he got trapped," said Fritzler from his office in Santa Barbara 
after talking to members of the crew by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"She attempted to 'buddy-breathe' him," he said, sharing the mouthpiece to her 
oxygen tank. "When she ran out of air, she made an emergency ascent." 
</P>
<P>
After Graves reached the surface, one of the officers of the vessel, Bill 
Brigham, dived into the water, freed McLaughlin and brought him up, Fritzler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials said McLaughlin's pulse, heartbeat and other vital signs 
were undetectable when he was rushed to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Graves suffered nausea and showed some signs of the bends -- a blood disorder 
that afflicts divers who rise too rapidly from the ocean. She was treated at 
the hospital Thursday and released.

PLAYA DEL REY ROAD COLLAPSE SNARLS TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A two-mile section of a busy oceanfront thoroughfare in Playa del Rey was 
closed to all traffic Friday in the midst of the rush hour after a broken sewer 
main caused the roadway above it to sink. The road was expected to be shut down 
through the weekend, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
City personnel barricaded all roads leading onto Vista Del Mar between Culver 
Boulevard and Imperial Highway, said Kevin Walton, a communications supervisor 
with the Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The incident, which did not involve any sewage spill, occurred when sewage 
gases finally ate through the top side of an old concrete outfall line 
installed in 1922, according to Ray Jellison of the city's Department of 
Sanitation. He said the road directly above the ruptured pipe then sank, 
eventually opening a three-foot-wide hole in the street. 
</P>
<P>
Jellison said the damage to the pipe was "not enough to cause any real problems 
with sewage, which is still flowing."

FOUR-STATE SURVEY OFFERS INSIGHTS INTO REGIONAL DIFFERENCES; 
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIANS FOUND RELIGIOUS, BUT IN UNORTHODOX WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Californians, who tend to be rootless and highly mobile, are about twice as 
likely not to have any religious affiliation as are residents of other parts of 
the nation, a new survey has found. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Golden State appeals to the religiously unorthodox, with nearly one in 
three residents believing in reincarnation and more than one in five practicing 
Eastern-style meditation -- more than twice the percentage in the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"California is a surprising mix," declares Phillip E. Hammond, a professor of 
religious studies and sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. 
"It's least religious in some ways and most in others. . . . There's a lot of 
loose religiosity floating around." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Four States Surveyed 
</P>
<P>
Hammond is conducting a $249,000 study of regional differences in religious 
styles. Funded by Lilly Endowment, his survey is part of a project to help 
mainline church leaders confront the widespread challenges awaiting American 
Protestantism next century. The data was obtained from 2,600 telephone 
interviews last fall with people aged 24 to 60 in California, Massachusetts, 
Ohio and North Carolina. Equal random samples were taken in each state. 
</P>
<P>
Californians are about twice as likely to identify with nondenominational 
churches but only half as likely to be evangelical as are Protestants in the 
other states, the survey shows. "Nondenominational," Hammond explained in an 
interview at his oceanside campus office, "means independent congregations that 
don't recognize larger organizational connections." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Definition of Evangelical 
</P>
<P>
"Evangelical" refers to conservative, affiliated denominations such as the 
Southern Baptist Convention, the Church of the Nazarene and the Assemblies of 
God. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, only 49% of Californians hold membership in a church or 
synagogue, compared to 68% of the combined respondents in the three other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Another finding is that Californians tend to drop out -- and stay out -- of 
church and synagogue involvement to a greater degree than residents elsewhere: 
59% of Californians reported a dropout period of two years or more, compared to 
a combined 45% in the other states. And there were fewer "returnees" who later 
became active again -- 49% versus 58%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Families Not Close 
</P>
<P>
Hammond also found that Californians are less likely to be surrounded by family 
members and close associates who share their religious views -- a finding that 
supports the perception that ever since Gold Rush days, Californians have 
tended to be more mobile and less rooted than people in other areas of the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said he and his colleagues chose Massachusetts to represent the Eastern 
Seaboard and North Carolina to represent the South. Ohio, "a one-state mirror 
for all 50," is regarded by pollsters as a microcosm of the country because of 
its demographic balance. Indeed, in the survey questions, Ohio always came out 
in the middle, Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
West Coast Represented 
</P>
<P>
West Coast religion is distinctive, in Hammond's opinion. So while California 
is unique, the state is also representative of the Pacific states, particularly 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond, who is a past president of the professional Society for the Scientific 
Study of Religion, found that Californians are less inclined to pray, read the 
Bible regularly, take the Scriptures literally and say mealtime grace. They 
also are less likely to have had a "born-again" experience than the combined 
respondents of the other states. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to believing in reincarnation and ghosts, and in practicing 
meditation techniques such as those taught by Transcendental Meditation, Zen 
and other "New Age" groups, Californians are more "religious" than their 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Morality's Role Uncertain 
</P>
<P>
Hammond also found that people who tend to disavow "conventional" sexual and 
family norms are positively associated with "unconventional" religious styles, 
particularly belief in reincarnation and the practice of meditation. But 
Hammond said he is not sure how to interpret this. 
</P>
<P>
"Do people adopt the 'new morality' because they practice meditation, or the 
other way around?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The morality measure in the survey was based on asking interviewees whether 
they thought premarital sex, homosexual relations and abortion were wrong, and 
whether they thought "the husband ought to have the main say-so in family 
matters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women's Ordination Favored 
</P>
<P>
The gray-bearded Hammond stresses that his data analysis so far is 
"preliminary" and "provisional." But, pointing to stacks of computer printouts 
during the interview, he added: "The religious differences we are finding are 
true differences. . . . We are developing confidence as the probability 
patterns build up." 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said he was surprised to find widespread approval for women's 
ordination, with the only scant resistance being in North Carolina. Even there, 
75% of the respondents approve of women ministers, and in heavily Roman 
Catholic Massachusetts, it's 86% -- highest of the four sampled states. The 
Vatican prohibits women priests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Differences on 'Born Again' 
</P>
<P>
He sees stronger regional differences in what people mean when they say they 
have been "born again": 
</P>
<P>
"I think being evangelical in North Carolina is quite a different experience 
than being evangelical in California. The mainline people -- the Baptists -- in 
Carolina have been 'born again,' " he said. "It's a part of their culture. Here 
in California, a 'born-again' (person) is apt to have been a dropout, or one 
not reared (as) anything. It's a kind of 'entry-level' expression, I'm 
guessing. It's more strongly tied to conservative views -- theological and 
social and political -- than it is in North Carolina." 
</P>
<P>
In like manner, Hammond predicts that the bottom lines of his survey will show 
marked regional differences in what it means, for example, to be a Roman 
Catholic or a Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to show that mainline religion has no single problem, so 
there is no single solution," he concluded. "And there will be considerable 
variation . . . not just regional, but within regions. . . . There will be an 
intensification of religion as a consumer item, and I think California is 
leading the nation in this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND PRACTICES 
</P>
<P>
A survey of religious styles in California compared to an average of samples 
taken in three states, Massachusetts representing the East, North Carolina 
representing the South and Ohio representing Middle America.

EVANGELICALS' CONFERENCE STRESSES NEW STRATEGIES

<P>
About 4,000 evangelical Christians opened a conference this week to forge new 
strategies for spreading the faith in a rapidly changing world. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to preach to everyone in the world by the end of this century and 
try to take advantage of political changes such as liberalization in the Soviet 
Union and the growth of Christianity in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the 10-day convention, dubbed Lausanne II after a similar 
gathering in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1974, represented 191 countries, making 
it one of the largest gatherings of its kind, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Opportunities Cited 
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address, the Rev. Leighton Ford, chairman of the Lausanne 
committee that is sponsoring the conference, said the evangelical movement is 
facing new opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we wait expectantly to see what the new openness and longing for freedom 
in our world -- as shown in the spirit of glasnost and the events in China -- 
will mean for the future of the Gospel," said Ford, a Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
Ford said he welcomed delegates from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary, East Germany, Romania, Cuba, Mozambique and other Communist countries 
to the convention. 
</P>
<P>
But another official said that the Soviet delegation had not arrived and that 
the list of those who are in Manila had not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
Ford also noted an increase in interest in evangelism among major Christian 
denominations. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we do not hear the word moratorium, and many of these same historic 
churches are rethinking the need for aggressive missionary outreach and some 
have called for the '90s to be a decade of evangelism," said Ford, a 
brother-in-law of the American evangelist, the Rev. Billy Graham. 
</P>
<P>
Graham was set to speak at the Manila conference, but commitments in London 
prevented him from coming, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Ford said that by the year 2000, world evangelicals should be able to reach 2.5 
billion people who have not heard the Gospel. 
</P>
<P>
He also cited an increase in the number of missionaries from developing 
countries and the need to face economic and social issues in spreading the 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
"(Before) our world was not quite so clearly aware of the 'troubles' in 
Northern Ireland or of apartheid in South Africa, where the Gospel has been 
wrapped in the sectarian robes of race and power," Ford said. "Now, we are 
aware, and we stand with our brothers and sisters in those areas where they 
seek to faithfully live and speak for Christ." 
</P>
<P>
He told the delegates they must find ways to make the faith attractive to 
people in widely differing parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Indians see Christ's peace in a way that Englishmen don't. Brazilians see it 
in a way that Nigerians don't. Pacific Islanders see it in a way that Germans 
don't," Ford said. "But as we focus in these next 10 days on Christ, we may 
learn to proclaim his peace as he did." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Thomas Wang, Lausanne II international director, said continued 
suffering has helped in the steady growth of Christian churches in China since 
the world's most populous country fell under Communist rule in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chinese Church Growth 
</P>
<P>
"Suffering is one of the important reasons for churches to grow," said Wang, an 
American. "I believe that has been the main reason for the Chinese churches to 
grow from 800,000 members in 1949 to 50 million today." 
</P>
<P>
China forced a halt to religious activity during the 1966-76 Cultural 
Revolution but has since allowed churches to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
Wang said about 300 Chinese church representatives had been expected to attend 
the Manila conference, but China's crackdown on the democracy movement has made 
it virtually impossible for Chinese to obtain exit visas. 
</P>
<P>
Wang said he expected that seven Chinese church leaders who were outside China 
when the crackdown began would attend.

KKGO-FM TO ADD CLASSICAL TO ITS JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
KKGO-FM, the area's only commercial all-jazz radio station, will begin 
programming classical music in January. 
</P>
<P>
"We've decided to come to the rescue of the classical audience," said KKGO 
general manager and president Saul Levine, referring to the rumored format 
change at all-classical KFAC-FM. 
</P>
<P>
KKGO, which has been an all-jazz station since its inception in 1959, will 
continue to play jazz around the clock on its AM station, KKGO-AM (540), which 
had been a low-power station but is being expanded with new equipment including 
a 25,000-watt transmitter. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said he plans to turn over the lion's share of programming hours on its 
FM station (105.1) to classical music. Classical music will be heard from 7 
a.m. to 9 p.m. on the FM station. The remaining night and early morning hours, 
the station will simulcast the jazz being broadcast on the AM signal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very dedicated to the jazz format and we wouldn't do anything that 
would take jazz off the air," Levine said. "We were cast in this dilemma: We're 
devoted to jazz but we also weren't going to stand by and see L.A. left without 
a classical music station. So, we're going to do both. We think it will be a 
nice mix. Actually, we're hoping classical listeners will listen to jazz too." 
</P>
<P>
According to industry observers, KFAC-FM (92.3) general manager Jim De Castro 
told his employees last month to expect a change to a contemporary or album 
rock format at the station in September. However, this information had not been 
made public. The station was purchased by Evergreen Media Corp. in January for 
$55 million and speculation of a format change has been widespread since then. 
(Evergreen owns several rock radio stations around the country.) 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Levine said he had decided that KKGO-AM would begin 
broadcasting classical music in July. He decided against that plan when he 
became convinced that KFAC would indeed change formats and realized that this 
switch would leave no commercial classical station on the FM dial. 
</P>
<P>
Levine further maintained that the sound distinctions of the two musical 
formats would best be served with jazz -- which tends to use fewer instruments 
-- on AM and classical orchestras broadcast on FM stereo. 
</P>
<P>
"A jazz group with piano, drums and a sax will sound very good on AM, whereas 
50 violins with strings that go way off the end of the sound spectrum will 
sound better in FM," Levine said. "For those who want to hear jazz in full 
fidelity on stereo, they'll still be able to hear it at a certain time on FM." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the FM station would continue to cover special jazz events such as 
the Playboy Jazz Festival or the Long Beach Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll preempt the classical programming," Levine said. "I'm sure our classical 
audience that doesn't want to hear it will understand and come back afterward." 
</P>
<P>
Jazz fans had mixed reactions to the change. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bob Popescu, owner of Catalina Bar and Grill, a jazz club in Hollywood: "I 
think it's a bad idea, because for people like me that listen to KKGO all the 
time in my car . . . it's the only station I listen to, and I don't want to 
switch around. I may not continue to listen to KKGO." 
</P>
<P>
Said KKGO listener Ann Erb: "I think it's an excellent combination: jazz for 
the evening, classical in the day," 
</P>
<P>
Levine said his station has been acquiring a library of classical recordings 
over the past few months and now has "thousands of works." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the classical music community expressed relief that another 
commercial station plans to pick up the classical format. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly need these stations to service the classical music lovers of 
Southern California," said Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra spokeswoman Norma 
Flynn. "We're very pleased that KKGO and Saul Levine will be coming in. He's a 
knight in shining armor." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a wonderful idea," said Rae Macdonald, production manager of Los 
Angeles Master Chorale, who said she listens to jazz at night and classical 
music by day. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction among KFAC staffers to KKGO's attempt to rescue classical programming 
was a bit more hesitant, however. Some worried that the station's manager and 
Levine had struck a deal that might preclude another station owner from 
stepping forward and picking up KFAC's classical format and library. Sources 
say De Castro has been peddling KFAC's library and its call letters for the 
past few months anticipating a public outcry over the format change. 
</P>
<P>
But, Levine said that the price -- estimated by industry insiders at more than 
$1 million -- was too steep. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no deal between us," Levine said. "And there's no 
understanding, no payments, not anything. We're just proceeding on our own 
without any kind of contact with (KFAC)." 
</P>
<P>
Classical music can also be heard on KUSC-FM (91.5), a public radio station. 
However, the number of hours of classical programming on that station has 
dropped as more news programs and other forms of musical programming have been 
added.

SAM DONALDSON WARMING UP FOR A NEW NEWS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
About ABC News' new "PrimeTime Live" series: It will, as the title suggests, be 
broadcast live, it will be co-anchored by Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer and, 
in a departure from weekly network newscast tradition, it will have a studio 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
But there won't be re-creations of news stories, dramatizations that to a 
certain extent will be utilized in a new NBC News program, "Yesterday, Today, 
Tomorrow," and in CBS News' revamped "West 57th." 
</P>
<P>
That's the word from Donaldson who, while saying he is certain those two 
programs will be responsible about their re-creations, said that "I leave it to 
them, gladly." 
</P>
<P>
In January, he gladly fled the White House beat he had covered since 1977 to 
work on what will be ABC's latest attempt to launch a second prime-time news 
series to join its 11-year-old "20/20." 
</P>
<P>
With Sawyer, who left CBS' "60 Minutes" in February for a reported $1.6-million 
annual stipend at ABC, their one-hour Thursday series premieres Aug. 3 at 10 
p.m. (West Coast viewers will get it on a tape-delay basis). 
</P>
<P>
"PrimeTime Live," whose on-air staff includes former NBC White House 
correspondent Chris Wallace, has had four practice runs so far, and will do 
four more in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
When it bows, Donaldson said, viewers will see a topical broadcast, one with 
investigative pieces, but a program that generally spotlights current stories, 
with each segment containing some live reporting. 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, "I'd like to see the first story of each broadcast be one which 
swings with the thing people are talking about that week, the hot story if you 
will." 
</P>
<P>
"We're also going to try to do a lot of the old 'Person to Person' stuff," he 
said, referring to the old CBS series in which Edward R. Murrow interviewed 
celebrities and others either in their homes or by long-distance, he in New 
York and the subject at home. 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson and Sawyer will co-anchor from a New York studio, "but it is our 
intention, both of us, to get out of the studio and not just sit there on those 
chairs," Donaldson said. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer was not available for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson, although accessible, was somewhat busy himself this week. In 
addition to work on "PrimeTime," he filled in for the ailing Ted Koppel on 
Wednesday's "Nightline." He also was preparing for his regular Sunday stint on 
"This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the new program will have a studio audience, he explained that it 
"gives us the energy of being able to talk to people, some of whom may be just 
off the street." 
</P>
<P>
"But a lot of them will be people we've invited," and will be identified as 
ABC's guest experts on various subjects being scrutinized in a given broadcast, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have a studio audience every Thursday," he said. "But I don't promise 
you that we will interact with them every Thursday. We'll do that only when it 
is sensible to do that. This isn't 'Donahue' or 'Oprah' or 'Geraldo,' and we're 
not going to use a studio audience that way." 
</P>
<P>
There has been some controversy over the news re-enactment segments planned for 
CBS' re-tooled "West 57th," to be anchored by NBC alumnus Connie Chung, and 
NBC's "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow," which is getting a three-program tryout 
that starts a day before "PrimeTime" premieres. 
</P>
<P>
Former CBS News president Richard S. Salant has decried news re-creations by 
news organizations, although they aren't new. CBS' "You Are There" in 1953-58 
re-enacted historical moments such as the Boston Tea Party. So did an ABC News 
bicentennial special several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson, like Salant, is against re-creations by broadcast news 
organizations, even though he emphasizes that he feels the NBC and CBS news 
programs doing them "will do it responsibly, to the extent they can, and I'm 
sure they'll be honest about it with their viewers." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, he said, is that "if you hold yourself out to be doing a news 
broadcast, it automatically, in viewers' minds, means that this is the real 
McCoy, that these guys are going to show us, tell us, talk to people, for 
real." 
</P>
<P>
Even if a news program is honest about its dramatizations, he said, and tells 
viewers " 'This isn't the real McCoy; we weren't there when it happened but 
we're going to re-create it faithfully,' I think you set up questions in the 
viewer's mind about everything else you do. And I don't think you ought to be 
in the business of being confusing about your mandate and who you are." 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson spoke by phone from Washington, where he lives and from where he will 
commute to New York for "PrimeTime." He said the program has a two-year 
commitment from ABC/Capital Cities chairman Thomas Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean ABC will stick with the program's format if it proves a 
misfire, Donaldson said: "He's no fool. He's not saying, 'If you put a bomb on 
the air, I'll stick with that bomb for two full years.' No, of course not. 
They'll change it, they'll modify it, maybe they'll throw me off." 
</P>
<P>
What he believes the commitment means, he said, is that if the first version 
isn't successful, "we're going to keep on trucking" during the two-year period 
until a version that works evolves. 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson intends to keep spending his Sunday mornings on the Brinkley 
broadcast unless it becomes clear that he can't do that and "PrimeTime" too, he 
said. In that event, he will give up the Brinkley program. 
</P>
<P>
He also will continuing living in Washington unless it becomes clear that it 
interferes with his "PrimeTime" duties, he added. If that happened, he would 
move -- but very reluctantly. "I don't like New York," Donaldson said. "I love 
Washington."

ROBERT HILBURN: THE HEAVY HITTERS OF COUNTRY, R&amp;B MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elvis Presley was far and away the most successful record artist of the modern 
pop era, a point that Wisconsin researcher Joel Whitburn has documented in a 
series of books devoted to the history of the Billboard magazine pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
But who are the most successful artists in country music and rhythm and blues, 
the two styles whose fusion in the '50s gave birth to rock 'n' roll and which 
have continued, in varying degrees, to influence the pop-rock mainstream? 
</P>
<P>
Whitburn supplies the answer in a pair of new books: The top R&amp;B and 
country artists, respectively, are James Brown and Eddy Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
The books -- "Top R&amp;B Singles 1942-1988" and "Top Country Singles 
1944-1988" -- chronicle the magazine's weekly pop and country charts for the 
years involved and assign points to individual artists for every week they have 
a single on the charts, with bonus points for Top 10 or No. 1 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's victory isn't a surprise. Despite such worthy rivals as Aretha 
Franklin, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, Brown remains a major presence in 
R&amp;B. His passionate vocal and performance styles have influenced hundreds 
of artists, both in rock and in R&amp;B -- from Mick Jagger and Prince to 
Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
But Arnold's victory will probably be a surprise to most contemporary pop fans 
because Arnold is far less known today than such other country artists as 
Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold, who enjoyed his greatest success between 1945 and 1969, was a break 
from Nashville's hard-core "hillbilly" tradition -- someone whose smooth vocal 
style was closer to pop in many ways than the rural emphasis of such rivals as 
Roy Acuff and Hank Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold, whose 91 Top 10 country hits included "Bouquet of Roses" and "Make the 
World Go Away," helped win new fans for country music among previously 
skeptical pop fans and is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. But he 
has far less influence on today's crop of "back-to-basics" country stars 
(including Randy Travis and Dwight Yoakam) than such former contemporaries as 
Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-one-year-old Arnold lives in semi-retirement near Nashville. Brown, 55, 
has been in prison in Columbia, S.C., since December, serving a six-year 
sentence for failing to stop for a police car, a felony in that state. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that chart success is not an exact measurement of sales, but 
Whitburn's stats do provide the most comprehensive evaluation of an artist's 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular R&amp;B singles artists, according to Whitburn's research 
(along with the number of points they received in his evaluation system): 
</P>
<P>
1 -- James Brown (11,872 points -- 57 Top 10 hits). 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Aretha Franklin (8,732 -- 48). 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Ray Charles (8,462 -- 40). 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Temptations (8,065 -- 42). 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Louis Jordan (7,361 -- 54). 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Stevie Wonder (7,122 -- 42). 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Marvin Gaye (7,029 -- 33). 
</P>
<P>
8 -- B.B. King (6,760 -- 24). 
</P>
<P>
9 -- Fats Domino (6,735 -- 39). 
</P>
<P>
10 -- Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips (6,282 -- 30). 
</P>
<P>
Whitburn, who has published nearly three dozen musical research books since 
forming his company in 1970, also notes in "Top R&amp;B Singles" the most 
successful R&amp;B artists by decade: Jordan in the '40s, Domino in the '50s, 
Brown in the '60s and '70s, and Prince so far in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Ross, he says, has achieved more points as a solo artist (4,541) than as 
a member of the Supremes (4,405). If the figures were combined, she would move 
into second place, ahead of Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
However, Michael Jackson's solo points (3,525) place him slightly behind the 
points he earned as a member of the Jackson 5 (3,805). Surprisingly, Elvis 
Presley, with 3,934 points, ranks higher on the charts than the either the solo 
Jackson or the Jackson 5. 
</P>
<P>
The most successful country artists: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Eddy Arnold (17,092 points -- 91 Top 10 hits). 
</P>
<P>
2 -- George Jones (16,198 -- 77). 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Johnny Cash (13,356 -- 51). 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Merle Haggard (12,171 -- 70). 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Conway Twitty (11,905 -- 72). 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Ray Price (10,870 -- 46). 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Webb Pierce (10,791 -- 58). 
</P>
<P>
8 -- Willie Nelson (10,570 -- 37). 
</P>
<P>
9 -- Marty Robbins (10,550 -- 47). 
</P>
<P>
10 -- Dolly Parton (10,191 -- 51). 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Brown in the R&amp;B field, no one dominated the country charts for two 
decades in a row, according to statistics in Whitburn's "Top Country Singles." 
Arnold was the leader in the '40s, followed by Pierce in the '50s, Jones in the 
'60s, Twitty in the '70s and Nelson so far in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that struck me about the country charts is the loyalty of the fans," 
Whitburn said. 
</P>
<P>
"When an artist breaks through with a couple of Top 10 hits, he's almost 
guaranteed of a long career. We found five country artists who had hits in five 
different decades. It's almost the opposite in R&amp;B, where there is an 
enormous amount of turnover on the charts. You obviously have some R&amp;B 
artists with long careers, but not nearly as many." 
</P>
<P>
A few of Whitburn's pop books are sold in stores, but most of his collections 
-- including the new R&amp;B and country volumes -- are available only by mail 
order through his company. Catalogues may be obtained by writing him at Record 
Research Inc., Menomonee Falls, Wis. 53051. 
</P>
<P>
LIVE ACTION: Tickets go on sale Monday for Elton John's third Forum show (Aug. 
18) and his Pacific Amphitheatre appearance (Aug. 19). . . . Bob Dylan will be 
at the Pacific on Sept. 8 and at the Greek Theatre on Sept. 9, while Santana

PAYDAY FOR AN ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT

<P>
As controversy over government support of the late Robert Mapplethorpe's 
homoerotic photography dies down, art world business goes on as usual. 
Christie's New York this week announced plans to auction Mapplethorpe's 
collection of art and furniture, valued at more than $3 million. Proceeds of 
the Oct. 31 sale will go to the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation to benefit AIDS 
research and to photography collections at major museums. 
</P>
<P>
The photographer, who died in November of AIDS at 42, established the 
foundation over a year ago and put about $500,000 into it before his death, 
according to attorney Michael Stout, executor of the estate. At his death, 
Mapplethorpe left the bulk of his estate to the foundation. Assets of the 
foundation could total $5 million to $25 million, depending on proceeds of the 
auction and how Mapplethorpe's photographs are marketed by his studio, Stout 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's auction of about 530 objects -- divided into 193 lots -- will not 
include any of Mapplethorpe's photographic work. Among pieces to be sold are 
contemporary artworks, Impressionist and modern paintings, 19th-Century and Old 
Master drawings, prints, sculpture, decorative arts, furniture and photographs 
by other artists. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the most expensive items -- including four works by Andy Warhol (valued 
from $30,000 to $1 million), a Tony Smith sculpture ($100,000 to $150,000), a 
small still life by Belgian Expressionist James Ensor ($300,000 to $400,000) 
and a landscape by French intimist Edouard Vuillard ($200,000 to $300,000) -- 
will be sold separately in November sales of contemporary and modern art. (All 
estimates are preliminary and may be adjusted before the sale, according to 
Christie's officials.) 
</P>
<P>
The Mapplethorpe foundation and auction is patterned after "the Warhol model," 
Stout said, though less money is involved. Warhol's hoard of 10,000 objects 
brought $25.3 million in a 10-day sale last year at Sotheby's. Auction 
proceeds, several pieces of real estate and some of the late artist's work went 
to the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts benefiting nonprofit 
organizations that are involved with exhibitions, art education, historic 
preservation and urban planning. The foundation this year made 58 grants 
totaling nearly $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe was a far more selective collector than Warhol, but he had strong 
acquisitive instincts. Confessing an addiction to collecting in a recent House 
and Garden interview, Mapplethorpe said, "I'm doing my best not to do what Andy 
did. For every great thing, he had 10 pieces of junk. I just don't have room in 
my life for all that." While Warhol stored his collection in stacks of boxes 
that eventually filled all but two rooms of his six-story townhouse on the 
Upper East Side, most of Mapplethorpe's collection is displayed in his 
3,500-square-foot loft and studio at 35 W. 23rd St., above a discount office 
furniture store. 
</P>
<P>
The loft is a clean-lined, white-walled space artfully crammed with treasures 
and equipped with a photographic studio. Raw-boned Arts and Crafts furniture by 
Gustav Stickley mingles with high-tech coffee tables designed by Mapplethorpe, 
a Biedermeier mirrored shelf, one of George Nelson's black marshmallow chairs 
from the '50s and delicate burr-wood desks attributed to Gio Ponti. 
</P>
<P>
A rainbow of solid-color Italian glass bottles and vases fills a long eye-level 
shelf above a deck of cabinets. Scandinavian ceramics cluster near one side of 
the fireplace, while neoclassical statues sit on the hearth. Walls of a den 
area are almost completely covered with such objects as tribal masks, a 
crucifix, a cross-shaped mirror and small artworks ranging from a Brice Marden 
abstraction to 19th-Century drawings of animals and assorted images of male 
nudes. 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe acquired most of the objects to be auctioned during the '70s and 
'80s in New York, according to Dmitri Levas, his photography stylist and 
collecting partner. "Robert liked to find things that had already been found by 
stores. He didn't like to go to flea markets," Levas said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a hunter myself. I would do the scouting. But he loved to collect. If I 
brought him a Polaroid (of a prospective purchase), he would really perk up," 
Levas said. 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe's first major collection consisted of photographs, which in 1982 
he sold at Sotheby's for $98,203. Around the same time, Sam Wagstaff, 
Mapplethorpe's companion who died of AIDS in 1987, built a highly regarded 
photography collection, which he sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1984 for 
an undisclosed amount, reportedly about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the most valuable pieces in the sale were gifts or bequests from 
Wagstaff. Stout declined to state the total amount of Mapplethorpe's 
inheritance from Wagstaff but said he got "several million dollars," much of it 
in art. The most expensive contemporary piece in the auction, Warhol's 
silk-screen on canvas, "Little Race Riot," formerly belonged to Wagstaff. The 
four-panel work, currently in Warhol's retrospective exhibition, is valued at 
$700,000 to $1 million. The Ensor and Vuillard paintings were also inherited 
from Wagstaff. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the contemporary artworks came from trades with artists, according to 
Tina Summerlin, Mapplethorpe's former studio manager. Among these are portraits 
of Mapplethorpe by Warhol (valued at $80,000 to $120,000), David Hockney 
($50,000 to $75,000), Francesco Clemente ($10,000 to $15,000) and Don Bachardy 
($1,000 to $1,500). 
</P>
<P>
When Levas met Mapplethorpe, in 1980, the photographer already had his Arts and 
Crafts furniture and was beginning to buy glass. "The '50s were known for 
pretty wild shapes, but Robert went more for beautifully made, pure forms in 
the '50s glass and ceramics he collected," Levas said. "He was basically a 
Minimalist who loved things that were simple in form and color, and he went at 
it in an obsessive way." 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe also liked art that has "a strong masculine quality," Levas noted. 
That quality is evident in dozens of drawings, photographs and prints and in 
the neoclassical sculpture that Mapplethorpe bought and photographed during the 
last year of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a keen eye for the history of photography and knew that classical busts 
were often the subject of 19th-Century photographs," Levas said. But the 
sculptures were also a matter of convenience for the artist when he became too 
ill to schedule sittings for portraits or venture outside his studio, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe's foundation and studio offices may move into the loft on 23rd 
Street, where he lived and shot all of his pictures since 1985. His former 
business office and printing facility, at 24 Bond St., will probably be sold, 
Stout said, but no decisions about the property have been made. 
</P>
<P>
In the last months before his death, prices for Mapplethorpe's photographs 
ranged from about $5,000 for prints to $20,000 for unique images. A current 
show at BlumHelman Gallery in Santa Monica offers 24x20-inch prints from 
editions of 10 for $10,000 and diptychs for $20,000. Mapplethorpe's auction 
record is $16,500, set last April at Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation will take a "quite conservative" approach to marketing 
Mapplethorpe's work, the attorney said. The studio will only print negatives 
that the photographer authorized and only in the small editions he intended. 
The foundation will maintain an archive of Mapplethorpe's work and keep all 
one-of-a-kind pictures that he had in his possession at his death. Images 
produced in editions will be sold, at the rate of a few per year, by the Robert 
Miller Gallery in Manhattan.

DAWNING OF THE 'DAY OF THE LOTUS' 
</P>

<P>
After a 3-year hiatus, the 12th "Day of the Lotus" festival returns to Echo 
Park Lake this weekend, representing 16 Asian-Pacific Island cultures and aimed 
at promoting intercultural understanding. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the festival will feature a flower exhibition on the park's 
25,000-square-foot island, in addition to the arts, music, dance programs, 
dragon boat races, sport competitions, food and community service booths. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day festival runs today and Sunday at the north end of the park between 
Glendale and Park boulevards, sponsored by the city of Los Angeles and 
Pepsi-Cola West. 
</P>
<P>
Dragon boat races will begin at noon both days, preceded by the blessing and 
"opening" of the dragon's eyes -- to ensure safe and successful races -- by the 
Rev. Karuna Dharma, abbess of the International Buddhist Meditation Center. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty entries are expected in the races, including teams from Asian and 
Pacific community organizations, the Los Angeles Police Department and local 
media, including 1986 winners from KCBS-TV. 
</P>
<P>
After a traditional Chinese lion dance, a kung-fu demonstration and Thai 
classical dancers performing at noon, official opening ceremonies begin at 2 
p.m. today with the singing of patriotic Samoan songs and the uncovering of a 
Samoan umi in which a pig has roasted since Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Music and dance by Asian and Polynesian groups will continue today until 9 p.m. 
and Sunday from noon to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
On Echo Park Island, dozens of floral designers, growers, suppliers, botanical 
specialists and members of flower societies will present lectures, 
demonstrations and displays with the underlying theme of Asian-Pacific cultural 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"The general public might get the impression that this is just a flower show, 
but . . . it's more than that," said co-chairman Dennis J. Wollen. "The 
emphasis is to show how flowers are used in different cultures, rather than to 
simply display how they are arranged or hold 'how to' talks to show how they're 
grown." 
</P>
<P>
Live lotus flowers symbolizing purity, cleanliness and creativity are in bloom 
in a corner of Echo Park Lake and hundreds of peach-colored silk lotuses, 
imported from China, will be displayed in arrangements adorning the bridge 
leading to the island. Designed by Mike Hashimoto and Sets Umeda, the 
3-foot-high arrangements will be lit at night and incorporate dried lotus pods, 
lotus leaves, pussy willow and gold fans. 
</P>
<P>
Other flowers and greenery donated by wholesale florists from the Los Angeles 
Flower Market, including orchids, ginger, lilies, tea flowers and bird of 
paradise (the official flower of the city of Los Angeles), will adorn 
exhibitors booths. 
</P>
<P>
In honor of the Recreation and Parks Department's 100th anniversary, the 
TreePeople of Beverly Hills will plant a tree and inaugurate a series of floral 
and plant lectures and demonstrations today in a gazebo constructed on the 
island. TreePeople president Andy Lipkus will discuss reforestation and the 
care and importance of trees today at 12:30 and 2 p.m. and Sunday at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A small lotus pond and fountain, with lilies as tiny as an inch in diameter, 
will be installed on the island, and Bill O'Keefe of O'Keefe Water Gardens will 
lecture on "The Mystery of the Lotus" both days at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Other lectures will include talks on bonsai by Ted E. Matson of the Descanso 
Bonsai Society, today and Sunday at 4 p.m.; on orchids by Wellington Paul of 
the Southern California Orchid Society at 5 p.m. Saturday, and on ikebana, the 
oldest known form of flower arranging, today and Sunday at 6 and 7 p.m. by four 
members of Kado Kyoju Kai-Ikebana Teacher's Guild, founded in Los Angeles in 
1938. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to displays by the six lecture/demonstration groups, 26 exhibitor 
tents will feature displays by international award-winning designer Osamu 
Honjo; San Lorenzo Nurseries, one of the largest wholesale florists in the 
state, and the Exotic Seed Co. and Rare Fruit Trees of Vista, exhibiting 
tropical fruit and rare Asian trees such as the white Chinese peach trees. 
Daisy and James Lee of the Chinese Knot Promotion Center in West Covina will 
design a lotus and give knot-tying demonstrations on the island, and other 
artisans will be represented adjacent the stage area. 
</P>
<P>
A juried art exhibition of works by junior and senior high school students 
along the "Day of the Lotus" theme will include drawings, paintings, 
photography and prints. 
</P>
<P>
More information and a complete schedule of performances is available by 
calling (213) 485-5548 or (213) 485-4825.

The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, administered by the county Health 
Care Agency division of environmental health, responds to calls on chemical 
spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. Sometimes it goes to 
the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire departments over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County (16 city departments plus the 
county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the county through 
mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county station in 
Irvine. HAZMAT is called in most, but not all, incidents. Following is HAZMAT's 
spill response log for May.

Fourth-quarter 1988 taxable sales in Orange County reached the highest level in 
two years and were 10% higher than the comparable period for the year before. 
In fact, sales were higher in all four 1988 quarters than in 1987's. San Juan 
Capistrano, Laguna Beach and Orange recorded the largest increases between 
fourth quarter 1987 and 1988; Los Alamitos and Huntington Beach had the only 
declines.

COUNTY TAXABLE SALES COMPARISON 
</P>
<P>
Although fourth-quarter 1988 taxable sales in Orange County were 10% higher 
than in 1987's comparable period, that increase was less than those recorded in 
three of the four contiguous counties. Nearly one-fifth, 19%, of such sales in 
the five-county area took place in Orange County; 10% of those in the entire 
state.

Based on erroneous information from old company publications, Friday's obituary 
of Richard G. Adams, former secretary and general counsel for the Times Mirror 
Co., said that he had joined the company in 1930, instead of 1931, and retired 
in 1960, instead of 1966. Also, he attended the University of Colorado and not 
the University of Oklahoma.

Slime makes Kay Sterner cringe. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that she's afraid of the make-believe psychomagnetic goop that 
threatens to drive Manhattan residents crazy in "Ghostbusters II." And it's not 
that she's afraid she'll succumb to its supposed diabolical powers. 
</P>
<P>
No, Sterner is concerned that anyone would create the idea of slime at all, or 
make fun of the discipline she and other members of the Spring Valley-based 
California Parapsychology Foundation have devoted much of their lives to. 
</P>
<P>
"They are distortions of the truth and they hurt people . . . especially young 
people who are impressionable," the parapsychologist said about the recently 
released movie. 
</P>
<P>
For Sterner and her colleagues who investigate bizarre psychic phenomena in San 
Diego County, parapsychology is not to be taken lightly, as Bill Murray, Dan 
Aykroyd and Co. do in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as much as Sterner bristles about the movie, there are some noticeable 
similarities between the ghostbusters of New York City and the 
parapsychologists of San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, they believe in psychic happenings. They live to investigate 
these strange occurrences. And they want to help people who cross paths with 
ghosts, or other mysterious phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
But, if you call on Sterner's services, don't expect her to come clad in the 
baggy brown jumpsuit and high-top sneakers preferred by her celluloid 
colleagues. Sterner's ghost-busting garb is her everyday wardrobe: double-knit 
pants, white button earrings and a beige blouse dotted with tiny red and blue 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hates to Be Called a Psychic 
</P>
<P>
And don't expect the wisecracking affability of Murray's character, Dr. Peter 
Venkman. Sterner pointedly tells you over and over again that she hates to be 
called a psychic. If you mispronounce a word, she won't hesitate to correct 
you. 
</P>
<P>
Should you question her credentials, she'll note that she has a doctorate from 
UCLA in education and psychology, has helped members of the British royal 
family with psychic endeavors and was once among the most sought-after 
parapsychologists in the world, shuttling from the United States to Europe to 
perform experiments. She has taught accredited courses in parapsychological 
research at San Diego State University and other colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Many people who call the California Parapsychology Foundation to report unusual 
happenings are terrified. About two months ago, Sterner and another 
parapsychologist visited the Rancho Penasquitos home of one such family, whose 
members reported pots and pans flying around their kitchen, cabinet doors 
slamming of their own volition and furniture rearranging itself in the living 
room. They even heard voices. 
</P>
<P>
Such psychokinetic activity is nothing to be afraid of and often happens to 
families with children in puberty, according to Sterner. The explosion of 
energy that occurs during those years is usually the culprit that triggers the 
activity, she said, especially among children of parents who are psychic. 
</P>
<P>
This investigation, however, wasn't wildly adventurous. When the team went to 
observe the Rancho Penasquitos home, they saw nothing as dramatic as what the 
family had reported. That's not unusual . . . ghosts generally don't appear on 
command. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get there, usually nothing happens," Sterner said. "The children are 
all quiet and on best behavior, sitting with their hands folded." 
</P>
<P>
She tried to assure the family that the weird occurrences would eventually 
stop, but they insisted on moving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strange Footsteps 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Sterner's best-known accomplishment in parapsychology is her purported 
discovery of spirits and ghosts haunting the Whaley House in Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, docents working in the historic two-story mansion began reporting 
strange occurrences. They heard footsteps in an upstairs bedroom and piano 
music in the parlor. Sometimes they smelled cigar smoke or perfume. 
</P>
<P>
Sterner investigated and concluded that several of the Whaleys, a 
turn-of-the-century merchant family, still inhabit the home in spirit. Without 
knowing the history of the house or family, Sterner accurately recounted 
incidents that had occurred on the property. Her findings were later 
substantiated historically, according to museum director June A. Reading. 
</P>
<P>
The staff at Whaley House still hears the sounds, and, on occasion, visitors to 
the house report whiffing Thomas Whaley's cigar. 
</P>
<P>
One recent day, a telephone call dragged Sterner off the flowered, velvet couch 
in her Spring Valley home that houses the parapsychology foundation. The caller 
was a woman who thought she had seen a ghost superimposed on a movie she was 
watching on television. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Associates Help Out 
</P>
<P>
Sterner talked with the woman for about 15 minutes, took her name and phone 
number, then promised to have another foundation member check it out. She turns 
such tips over to one of five or six core group members, who include a La Jolla 
tax attorney and a young federal budget analyst who, probably to Sterner's 
dismay, says he loves and even envies the fictional Ghostbusters. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone has had experiences that defy empirical reasoning," said Kris 
Sorenson, a University of San Diego graduate whose studies in philosophy led 
him into parapsychology. "There is something out there that's going on . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
That something is no more than the psychic energy everyone is born with, 
parapsychologists maintain. Whether it's labeled intuition or precognition, 
psychic ability or simply a gut feeling, everyone has the power to tune in to 
the "inner voice" that can guide them toward good experiences or away from bad 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to have people understand how truly remarkable we all are," Sterner 
said. "And that we all have these powers to a degree."

MISSED MANNERS -- IN PRAISE OF INHIBITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN TIERNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have a theory about all the unpleasant behavior taking place in public these 
days, but first let me tell you about the last time I saw my good friend Carly 
Simon. It was also the first time I saw her, but I'm following the standards 
for friendship laid down by Mickey Rooney when he recently was quoted as 
saying, "John F. Kennedy was one of my best friends. We first met in the 
elevator at the Waldorf Astoria, and we spoke again later at the White House." 
I never shared the intimacy of an elevator with Carly Simon, so I wouldn't go 
so far as to call her one of my best friends, but I did come within 12 feet of 
her once at a record store in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
My good friend was sitting on a platform signing her new album for a line of 
people that stretched half a block. That celebrity buzz was in the air, and 
Carly looked properly glamorous, except for one disconcerting detail. She was 
eating a Milky Way bar. There was a chewing-tobacco-size wad bulging in her 
cheek, which she was cheerfully masticating as she chatted with fans, 
occasionally opening her mouth -- and remember, this is no small mouth we're 
talking about -- to say "Really?" and providing a glimpse of caramel 
stalactites dripping from her teeth. This was not my image of how a star should 
behave, unless the star is Mr. Ed. I wanted to run up and tell my good friend, 
"Carly, there is a reason your mother told you not to talk with your mouth 
full." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there are two reasons for inhibitions like this. One is societal 
well-being: The world would be a more pleasant place if no one ever had to look 
at another person's half-eaten Milky Way. The other reason is personal shame: 
You might be classified as a slob. But, unfortunately, neither reason seems to 
carry much weight anymore, not even among people outside the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
A recent book title sums up the attitude I keep seeing on the street: "What Do 
You Care What Other People Think?" I'm talking about the woman on the bus who 
showered me in a cloud of debris brushed from her hair and filed from her 
nails. The man behind me at the movie who plopped his old Nikes six inches from 
my nose. The strangers in the elevator doing a graphic post-game analysis of 
last night's date. The teen-ager who made that extra effort to make sure 
everyone heard him using the sidewalk as a spittoon. The man who, at the start 
of an all-night flight to Europe, emerged from the plane's bathroom and walked 
up the aisle in a pajama shirt, black knee-high socks and boxer shorts. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not trying to argue that people are inherently ruder than they used to be. 
I've always been suspicious of trend-watchers who announce the discovery of 
something like "The New Obnoxiousness" -- and then, five years later, upon 
noticing that there are still a few polite souls left, trumpet "The Return to 
Gentility." I suspect that the percentage of utter boors in any society remains 
fairly constant over time. 
</P>
<P>
But certain environments bring out the boor in everyone, a fact long known to 
sociologists and Morton Downey Jr., and what has changed recently is the public 
environment in which most of us operate. We spend much more time among 
strangers. This trend has been going on for decades as people leave small towns 
for the anonymous big cities, but it has accelerated because of the recent boom 
in air travel. The traffic on American carriers has risen 65% in the past 
decade, to 455 million passengers last year, which means that on any day any 
city is crawling with out-of-towners. 
</P>
<P>
And what happens to those millions of conventioneers and tourists and sales 
reps when they go on the road? They quickly realize that they are not likely to 
enter into any lasting relationship with anyone they run into. (Unless, of 
course, they are Mickey Rooney, but that's another problem.) This changes the 
equation for inhibitions. You might refrain from depositing your nail filings 
on a fellow passenger if you knew tomorrow she might be depositing her nail 
filings on you. But you know you won't be seeing her tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, your victim may well be inspired to go off tomorrow and deposit her 
nail filings on someone else's lap, who will then retaliate against someone 
else the next day, who will then -- well, you can see that the world would be a 
more pleasant place if you would just put away the nail file now before this 
senseless cycle begins. But there's no personal incentive for you to be 
inhibited. The situation is the same sort of public-policy problem as the 
greenhouse effect (although I believe I'm the first to explicitly link global 
warming and nail filings). You see, the world would probably be a more pleasant 
place if everyone cut back on driving cars that emit gases that warm up the 
atmosphere, but this is not going to happen because every person realizes that 
his or her little car makes no difference in the global scheme of things. Why 
be the only one to make the sacrifice? So people go on driving -- and clipping 
their nails and putting their smelly sneakers on the seat. 
</P>
<P>
The only solution, I think, is to rely on the second reason for inhibitions: 
personal shame. This, too, tends to be forgotten nowadays -- if you're 
surrounded by strangers, who cares if they think you're a slob? But it may be 
possible to reinstitute a sense of shame by reminding people of another 
consequence of today's travel: You never know whom you're going to run into. 
</P>
<P>
I can offer one cautionary tale: A man, frustrated at being stuck for several 
blocks behind a woman driving slowly, pulled up next to her at a traffic light 
and shouted an obscenity while flashing her the finger. Then he realized, as 
she looked back in shock, that it was his wife's aunt. 
</P>
<P>
Try to keep this story in mind the next time you feel like dispensing with an 
inhibition. There is a moral, and it's the same moral I hereby offer Carly 
Simon: No matter where you are, a good friend may be watching.

THE CEREMONY OF DRILL: ART AND RITUAL, PERFORMED WITH SNAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY ALLEN, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How glorious: all the fine young men marching across the lawns of Washington -- 
Ft. Myer, the Ellipse, the Iwo Jima Memorial, the Marine Barracks and so on. It 
is summer now, and time for the evening parades and twilight tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
How sad, too: Close-order drill is a ritual from a lost era, like fox hunting. 
It is a souvenir of both the 18th-Century dream of a clockwork universe and the 
ancient Greek dream of a world in which wars would be decided by courage and 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like they're robots," an eighth-grader named Arnaud Voermans said 
recently, as he watched the sentries at the Tomb of the Unknowns do their 
ponderous strut through a light rain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like they're walking on air," said Jennifer Willett, a classmate at 
Brigantine North School in New Jersey. They were here on a class trip. They had 
just laid a wreath in front of the tomb. Now they watched the sentry march 21 
paces back and forth, a floating robot, a mechanical ghost who executed each 
step on the side of his foot, not the heel, then rolled the foot in, each foot 
touching a single imaginary line, as if he were not only walking a tightrope 
but trying to do it without waking anybody up. 
</P>
<P>
This is the gait of ceremonial drill, a gait practiced by both the Army and the 
Marines -- the Marines call it "slide and glide." The idea is to keep the head 
from bobbing, to get men and rifles moving together with an evenness that looks 
lethally self-conscious. It's part of the infinitely detailed aesthetics of 
American drill, delicate and implacable at the same time, a balancing of 
rigidity and ease. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, drill is part of the city's life, like the theater in New York. 
Troops have always gone through "the usual maneuvers in a masterly manner," in 
the words of a newspaper describing the Marines parading past Thomas Jefferson 
on July 4, 1801. The ritual at the Tomb of the Unknowns will end only when 
America ends. Dress-blues platoons slide through the winter twilights of 
inaugural parades like Kodachrome ghosts with their red ears and white gloves, 
the same white gloves that fold flags over coffins at Arlington National 
Cemetery, in the manner of the disembodied hands that appear in cartoons to 
paint a picture across the screen, although at Arlington Cemetery the picture 
is a flag that gets smaller and smaller until it is nothing but a fat triangle 
of blue stars being handed to a widow. 
</P>
<P>
Heels crack -- Army heels, at least, with the metal clickers on them. The 
Marines don't do that. They bang rifle butts, however. When done well, a 
platoon of rifle butts at once, this movement makes a crisp crashing noise. 
When done very well, on the concrete troop walk at 8th and I streets, it makes 
a sort of wet pop, like the sound of a bone breaking. 
</P>
<P>
The command for this is "order arms." 
</P>
<P>
HHhhO . . . Oooorrderrr . . . Then comes an utterance that is theoretically the 
word "arms." Actually, it is a hoarse bark that is driven upward by the 
officer's diaphragm with such pneumatic force that you expect to see a wisp of 
vapor trailing from his mouth like the mist from a pop-top soda can. 
</P>
<P>
The butts come down. The Friday night audience at the Marine Barracks goes, 
"Ahh." 
</P>
<P>
Drill teaches discipline but it no longer moves troops across battlefields. It 
is a technology that has become art by virtue of its uselessness. It is a 
sacrament for remembering heroes and burying our dead. It is performed all over 
America: by Girl Scouts in berets doing the endless, earnest shuffle of dress 
right, dress; by color guards marching out at the start of banquets, bridge 
dedications and playoff games to do that slow, wheeling high-step reminiscent 
of pistons working inside some old ship's engine room; by ROTC types in chromed 
helmet liners and sunglasses, and by old American Legion guys who fire a ragged 
salute on Memorial Day while little kids crawl around their feet, grabbing the 
ejected brass shells. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Navy, the Air Force and the Coast Guard have their color 
guards and drill teams, but the serious drill is done by the Army and the 
Marines. 
</P>
<P>
They hold each other in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to know about drill, there's two places you ask," says Marine 
Gunnery Sgt. D.L. Hall. "The Marines of 8th and I, and Black &amp; Decker." 
</P>
<P>
Says Army Sgt. 1st Class James P. Savage, at Ft. Myer: "I can show you Marines 
when we have joint-service ceremonies, you got to beat it into them with a 
baseball bat. The Army is the senior service, much as the Marines don't like to 
hear it. In the Military District of Washington, the Army will be the overseer 
of ceremonies." 
</P>
<P>
"In the winter, they wear earmuffs," says a Marine sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
"The Marines have done a good job of advertising themselves," says Army Maj. 
Tom Askins. 
</P>
<P>
The Army and Marines work with the same commands and basic movements. Their art 
is founded on the ideal of perfection, an 18th-Century aesthetic that got 
buried in the great landfill of 19th-Century romanticism and 20th-Century 
modernism, whose Promethean struggle and alienated individualism are not 
encouraged by drill instructors. 
</P>
<P>
Army Staff Sgt. James White gets a biblical lilt in his voice as he stands in a 
parking lot addressing a platoon of young soldiers who are learning to drill 
the Ft. Myer way: "Everything needs to be precise. When it's precise, then we 
create precision. Who has to make a correction and who does not have to make a 
correction? Who has accomplished the mission? Who got it right the first time? 
I want to hear one pop, all together." 
</P>
<P>
You see and hear perfection when drill has a quality that gets described with 
words like "tight" or "locked on" or "crispy" or "snap." The 14th revised 
edition of the Guidebook for Marines defines "snap" as: "In commands or 
signals, the quality that inspires immediate response. In drill, the immediate 
and smart execution of movement." 
</P>
<P>
Snap is to drill as swing is to jazz, an unmeasurable but conspicuous precision 
that gives you a rush you have to feel to understand. It can happen toward the 
end of basic training, when your platoon is out drilling for the millionth time 
and suddenly it comes together, it feels like the moment when your airplane 
lifts off the ground, a smoothness, a sense of possibility and infinite vista, 
oddly enough, given the fact that all you can see is the head of the man in 
front of you, the stubbled phrenology of the military world view. Nothing can 
stop you, and you can't do anything wrong. Power and virtue, together at last, 
rifles cracking from shoulder to shoulder. The men in front of you wheel into a 
column left, the platoon curling 90 degrees with the deft tidiness of a Slinky 
going downstairs. You know that when you hit the pivot point you'll turn with 
the same bite. It has a satisfaction that verges on the smug. 
</P>
<P>
Snap comes from attention to detail: the thumbtacks holding the cloth tight on 
a dress cap; the corsets that the Army wears -- for back support, they say, but 
it's hard to imagine they haven't noticed the look that they create; the safety 
pins at the waists of trousers to get the bottoms just touching the shoes, but 
never breaking; the blacking on the bottoms of shoes; white gloves in a perfect 
row down a rank standing at parade rest; the men on burial details lifting 
weights six hours a day and drilling with empty caskets so that the full ones 
float from church to hearse to grave with the rectilinear ease of a cursor 
moving across a computer screen. At Eighth and I, the Marines rehearse the 
evening parade twice each Friday morning, with critiquers scoring the execution 
of each command, then reviewing the second rehearsal on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Members of ceremonial drill units usually stand within an inch of six feet 
tall. Even those differences are hidden by lining men up by height, front to 
back and right to left. If a man lowers his head too far when looking down to 
fix bayonets, he is taught not to correct himself even a fraction of inch, lest 
there be a visible shift in the crescent of light reflecting from the visor of 
his dress cap. Better to be wrong and look right than the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
One civilian in 10,000 can see the differences between Marine and Army drill, 
but they are profound and philosophical, like the differences between the 
Spartans and the Athenians. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines favor a severely classical drill, a style that impresses you with 
its modesty, not its difficulties. It values clarity and directness (with 
occasional bits of bombast like the spotlighted bugler playing taps on the 
Barracks parapet). It is Apollonian to the point of being forbidding, of 
Blake's "fearful symmetry." To the Army, it may well look mechanical to the 
point of arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
Army ceremonial drill has more texture to it. Rifle butts ease to the ground. 
There's a tendency to add a subliminal curve here, a hint of a pause there, 
until the simplest of gestures, such as a salute by the corporal of the guard 
at the Tomb of the Unknowns, acquires a mysterious gravity. In facing 
movements, heels may flare out a little more than necessary -- a mannerist 
touch that comes from the same instinct that leads boys to customize cars. The 
slide and glide of the Tomb sentries can have a catlike delicacy. To Marine 
purists, it may look a little cute. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the Army decided that flag details were folding flags too 
quickly at the ends of funerals. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to do it in 60 seconds. It was too showboaty," says Staff Sgt. Kenneth 
Moomey. "We shoot for 90 seconds on the flag fold. We're averaging 88 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Drill is both art and ritual -- art in its working out of meaningful forms, 
ritual in the way that it is intended to change not just the people who do it 
but the people who see it. (Gen. George Patton said in 1945: "Ceremonies are 
important as a means of impressing our enemies, our allies and our own 
troops.") Drill also fits into a category that anthropologist John M. Roberts 
calls "judged display," like figure skating, the Miss America pageant, or jams 
and jellies at the state fair. On the other hand, we don't think of judged 
displays as having larger, metaphorical meaning, the way drill does. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter that we can't quite define drill. Its meaning is so clear in 
our minds that we never question it. Anthropologists, sociologists and 
psychologists don't study it. (Imagine the dissertations that would fill 
libraries if close-order drill were done by the Eskimos or 19th-Century slum 
dwellers or the insane.) We take it for granted, maybe because it has been part 
of Western thinking at least since the ancient Greeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The Greeks believed they were morally superior because of the way they 
fought," says Victor Hanson, author of a new book called "The Western Way of 
War-Infantry Battle in Classical Greece." Drill was a practical matter of 
teaching troops to fight in the tight formations called phalanxes, which drove 
over their enemies by sheer pushing power and discipline. "The way they did 
drill was more complicated than it is now, but they did it in cadence, like us, 
with flute players setting the time, and a large variety of commands -- raise 
spears, relax spears, that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the persistent legend that wily American sharpshooters defeated the 
British in their drilled formations, George Washington recognized early on that 
the war could not be won by farmers hiding behind trees. He asked Baron von 
Steuben to take Frederick the Great's drill and make it suitable for his 
volunteers. Von Steuben believed that each country's drill should reflect the 
"natural genius" of its people, hence the American style with its ordinary 
gestures and common-man simplicity, as opposed to the German goose step, or the 
huge and hearty arm swing of the British. When American drill is good it looks 
effortless. 
</P>
<P>
Western soldiers continued to fight in drilled formations until about the time 
of the American Civil War, when rifling increased the range and accuracy of 
military muskets so radically that troops were slaughtered if they did not take 
cover. The mass use of the machine gun in World War I was the final blow to 
most stand-up maneuvering by troops under fire, although British generals 
thought it suitable for the Battle of the Somme, in which 14,000 troops, 
advancing at a walk, were killed in the first 10 minutes of the battle. 
</P>
<P>
Still, we do it. Drill has remained as the cheapest item on the basic-training 
curriculum, and as a means of teaching discipline and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance of close-order drill could not be overestimated," writes Col. 
David Hackworth, the most-decorated hero of Vietnam, in his autobiography, 
"About Face." He recalls: "I was so proud to be a cog in that finely tuned 
machine. I loved the discipline: the relentless repetition -- basic drills 
reinforced again and again -- that conditioned a soldier to react to orders not 
only on the parade field but on the battlefield as well." 
</P>
<P>
It is an art of obedience, not responsibility. You do what you're told, and 
only what you're told. A million recruits have heard the preparatory command 
"forward" and have stepped off expecting "march," only to find themselves 
walking across a parade field in a silence that will be broken by a sergeant 
shouting, "Do not anticipate the command."

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: WESTMINSTER; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE, JURORS GATHER IN DEATH-CASE REUNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors in the Joselito Cinco murder trial in Westminster reportedly were 
shocked to hear that he committed suicide last year, six months after he was 
sentenced to death for the slaying of two San Diego police officers. 
</P>
<P>
When many of them called the court and the district attorney's office to ask 
questions, the prosecutors and the judge decided that they should have a 
reunion to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
Friday morning, most of the jurors and the prosecutors got together with 
Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas in his courtroom to talk about the case. 
Afterward, Cardenas treated everyone to lunch at his expense. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent eight months together on this case; we became like family," Cardenas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cinco, 26, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the Sept. 14, 1984, 
slayings of Kimberly Sue Tonahill, 24, of La Mesa and Timothy Ruopp, 31, of San 
Diego when the officers confronted him and some of his friends in Balboa Park. 
Another officer was wounded in the melee. The case came to Orange County on a 
change of venue from San Diego County because of the voluminous publicity about 
the case there. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors returned a death verdict against Cinco, rejecting life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Cinco claims he shot the officers in a drug-induced state during an argument 
with them. On June 10, 1988, Judge Cardenas refused to set aside the jury 
verdict and sentenced Cinco to death. 
</P>
<P>
"The jurors just had a lot of questions about what happened, and the 
prosecutors and I thought it would be good for us to all get together again," 
Cardenas said.

CONTROL TOWER MANAGER TOM REA IS PROMOTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Wayne Airport control tower Manager Tom Rea has been promoted to assistant 
air traffic manager at the Federal Aviation Administration's regional control 
center in El Toro, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rea's move was not connected with recent criticism of El Toro center, known as 
Coast TRACON, by the National Transportation Safety Board, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Fowler, a member of the operations staff at the FAA's western regional 
headquarters in Los Angeles, has replaced Rea at the FAA's John Wayne Airport 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler also worked previously as an air traffic controller at Los Angeles 
International Airport. At John Wayne Airport, he will supervise a staff of 26 
controllers. He said Friday that he might ask for one or two more controllers 
later this year, when new air safety zones are scheduled to be implemented 
around John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Takeoffs and landings totaled 533,484 at John Wayne Airport in 1988, compared 
to 623,519 at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft arriving and departing John Wayne Airport are controlled within a 
five-mile radius by the FAA tower there. Beyond that radius, aircraft are 
controlled by Coast TRACON.

CIGARETTE BUTT BLAMED FOR JETLINER SMOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smoke in the rear cabin area of an American Airlines BAe-146 jetliner at John 
Wayne Airport brought fire crews to the aircraft Thursday night immediately 
after the plane landed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
However, no damage was reported, and the smoke was traced to a cigarette butt 
thrown into the wastebasket in the aircraft's rear lavatory. 
</P>
<P>
Al Becker, spokesman for Dallas-based American, said smoke was reported when 
Flight 381 from San Jose landed with 50 passengers aboard at 10:23 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"All passengers were deplaned normally through the front stairs. . . . There 
were no injuries," Becker said. "The airplane went back into service this 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
"Under federal law," Becker said, "smoking is prohibited in all lavatories, and 
those announcements are made on board the airplane."

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: DO ANGELS HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gene Wojciechowski 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty-three questions to ponder (one for each victory) as the Angels attempt 
the unlikely: a second-half as good as the first. 
</P>
<P>
1) Is this the sequel to "Damn Yankees?" 
</P>
<P>
2) Was Minnesota Twins Manager Tom Kelly serious when he said the Angels were 
the team to beat in the American League West? 
</P>
<P>
3) Has Kelly been reading too many of Gary Gaetti's batting gloves? 
</P>
<P>
4) If American League Manager Tony La Russa needed a left-hander to pitch to 
Von Hayes in the All-Star game, why didn't he use Angel Chuck Finley rather 
than Milwaukee's Dan Plesac? 
</P>
<P>
5) What's more important: complete games or keeping reliever Bryan Harvey 
sharp? 
</P>
<P>
6) There hasn't been an injury to a member of the Angel starting rotation yet, 
has there? 
</P>
<P>
7) When does the Doug Rader Temper Tantrum Watch end? 
</P>
<P>
8) Why do we get the feeling that the Aug. 21-Sept. 3 trip (Kansas City, Texas, 
Boston and New York) will make or break the Angels? 
</P>
<P>
9) Is 1990 the year some major league team hires the other Lachemann (Hint: 
Marcel) as its manager? 
</P>
<P>
10) How long can the Angels succeed with Wally Joyner as their cleanup hitter? 
</P>
<P>
11) What's more annoying at Angel games: beach balls, video instructions on 
when to clap or the sound of breaking glass every time a foul ball falls into 
the crowd? 
</P>
<P>
12) Do you think Nolan Ryan regrets signing with the Texas Rangers? 
</P>
<P>
13) If the Angels don't fade like watercolors, does that mean Mike Port earns 
Executive of the Year honors? 
</P>
<P>
14) Will all those who said Jim Abbott wasn't ready for the majors please stand 
up? 
</P>
<P>
15) Is this the place where I apologize for saying that Bert Blyleven wouldn't 
make a difference? 
</P>
<P>
16) If Rader can have his contract extended halfway through the season, why 
can't Blyleven, whose agreement ends at the end of the year? 
</P>
<P>
17) Is it too late to find a true leadoff hitter? 
</P>
<P>
18) Will Skippy the Lobster be voted an honorary playoff share should the 
Angels make it that far? 
</P>
<P>
19) Why won't Port say the Angels went after Rickey Henderson? 
</P>
<P>
20) Whatever happened to Mark McLemore? 
</P>
<P>
21) Just a thought, but couldn't the curators of the Angels Hall of Fame bend 
the rules a bit to include the jersey of Mr. Jimmie Reese, a keepsake if there 
has ever been one? 
</P>
<P>
22) At what point will Harvey's lack of consistent work catch up with the 
Angels? 
</P>
<P>
23) Now that Bo Jackson has snapped a bat over his head, what will Chili Davis 
do next in response? 
</P>
<P>
24) Does Mike Witt finally have his act together? 
</P>
<P>
25) Can the Angels possibly end the season first in home runs and earned-run 
average? 
</P>
<P>
26) Will shortstop Dick Schofield's dismal batting average ever see the light 
of the .240s? 
</P>
<P>
27) Can the Angels afford another losing streak like their first, when they 
dropped 11 out of 14? 
</P>
<P>
28) Will reliever Greg Minton be able to give Rader 30 more appearances this 
season? 
</P>
<P>
29) Does Tony Armas actually lead the team in batting average? 
</P>
<P>
30) How is it possible that Jack Howell has nine more homers than Joyner? 
</P>
<P>
31) What happens if the Rangers complete a rumored deal that has All-Star 
designated hitter Harold Baines leaving Chicago for Texas? 
</P>
<P>
32) Did you know that the Angels led the division at the All-Star break in 
1979, 1982 and 1986? And that in each of those three years they ended up 
winning the AL West? 
</P>
<P>
33) Did you know that none of that means a single thing in 1989? 
</P>
<P>
34) Do you think Bruce Hurst regrets signing with the San Diego Padres? 
</P>
<P>
35) Which 1989 Angel baseball card do you think is worth the most on the 
collector's market these days? 
</P>
<P>
36) Did you say Abbott's? 
</P>
<P>
37) How is it that Angel pitchers have been selected for three of the past four 
All-Star games and not one of them has played? 
</P>
<P>
38) Has anyone noticed that Angel left-handers have a 21-11 record this year, 
as opposed to 11-16 in 1988? 
</P>
<P>
39) Can you believe that Abbott has a better record than Witt? 
</P>
<P>
40) Why did the Brewers trade Bill Schroeder? 
</P>
<P>
41) If Devon White's batting average continues to slide, will the same thing 
happen to his place in the order? 
</P>
<P>
42) Will Jim Eppard ever get to stay in Anaheim long enough to establish a 
mailing address? 
</P>
<P>
43) Will someone remind me not to let the Angels' Quad Cities affiliate book my 
hotel reservations? 
</P>
<P>
44) Who has bigger arms, Brian Downing or Bo? 
</P>
<P>
45) Is it possible to reduce the size of the Angel halo on the caps? It looks 
like a doughnut. 
</P>
<P>
46) Why is it no one is talking about the Kansas City Royals? 
</P>
<P>
47) Can it be true: The Angels don't miss Bob Boone? 
</P>
<P>
48) Do you think Gene Mauch regrets his decision not to return as Angel 
manager? 
</P>
<P>
49) You know those miniature toy figures of major league baseball players that 
are the rage? Is it true the Jose Canseco model shows him signing a speeding 
ticket? 
</P>
<P>
50) Did Ronald Reagan really say that Anaheim Stadium was the most beautiful 
ballpark in America? 
</P>
<P>
51) Do you think Reagan might have forever cost his party the Republican 
precincts in the Fenway Park and Wrigley Field area? 
</P>
<P>
52) Can we expect one more Angel trade before season's end? 
</P>
<P>
53) Is this where I'm allowed to amend my preseason prediction of an Angel 
fifth-place finish to third, behind the A's and Rangers?

MAKING A NAME;

FARYNIARZ USES FAST START IN TRAINING CAMP TO BECOME A FAMILIAR FACE IN RAM 
DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some questioned why the Rams opened rookie camp a week sooner than the rest of 
the league with only one of their 14 draft choices signed, forcing some 
second-year veterans to report a few days early just so the team had enough 
players to run routine practice drills with faceless free agents. 
</P>
<P>
What's the use? Why not save a week's worth of operating costs and use the 
money, say, to sign some draft picks? 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson has a quick answer, though he can't spit out Brett 
Faryniarz's name fast enough. You try it. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do is realize, as I told these guys, that Brett Faryniarz was 
in this group last year," he said. "Nobody knew how to spell his name. I still 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
Faryniarz (pronounced Fair-i-nez) was a free-agent outside linebacker from San 
Diego State who ended up making the 45-man roster, a longshot comparable to 
Orlando winning the NBA title next season. 
</P>
<P>
With all the time and money pumped into scouting combines and draft research 
these days, talented players rarely fall through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
But Faryniarz did. And if not for that first week of rookie camp, before 
attentions were turned to high-priced draft choices and veterans, Faryniarz 
figures he'd be in the real world today, working some 9-to-5 shift. 
</P>
<P>
The first week of camp is a free agent's only real chance to make a name. Even 
if it's a funny-sounding one. 
</P>
<P>
"It may have been an attention getter to some extent, a name like that," 
Faryniarz said. "They refer to you as that guy over there with the weird name." 
</P>
<P>
No one wants to be John Doe when there's a football team to be made. 
</P>
<P>
So what's it like to be a new free agent in town, a player who never received a 
signing bonus and was overlooked through 12 rounds of drafting scrutiny? 
</P>
<P>
"Very lonely," Faryniarz said. "The day I flew in was the day I met my first 
person on the team. You got all the young veterans, they know each other. The 
rookies (draft choices) know each other from (mini) camp. All of a sudden 
you're here, and everyone's talking to everybody. And I don't know anybody." 
</P>
<P>
He remembers being issued uniform No. 63b, not even a linebacker's number. And 
when exactly did they start using the alphabet on jerseys? 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't fun, but that's part of being a free agent, I guess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Faryniarz knew he needed to make some noise in a hurry. Getting pushed around 
in practice was a one-way ticket out of camp. Faryniarz made sure he got 
involved in a few scrapes, just to raise some eyebrows. Maybe he'd get lucky 
and even get yelled at. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking, whatever I do, I'm not going to let people push me around," he 
recalled. "I'm going to have a lot of pride. I was trying to play intense and 
show the coaches. I kind of picked up on what they wanted to see." 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, he climbed the depth-chart ladder: 10th string, ninth string, eighth 
string, seventh string. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, Faryniarz, a converted defensive end and pass-rush specialist, arrived 
at a time when the Rams were switching defenses to a five-linebacker scheme and 
were in need of outside pass rushers. 
</P>
<P>
If Faryniarz was anything, he was quick. He made a few big plays in a scrimmage 
against Dallas. Another big break came when the Rams decided to release Woody 
Vann, a special teams star who hadn't progressed much as an outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard from a few vets that they let Woody go for me," he said. "Maybe it was 
true. If it was, I was flattered at the time, because there were still three 
weeks to go." 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks until the final cut, that is. Faryniarz had somehow survived the 
summer, helping himself with quarterback sacks in exhibitions games against 
Denver and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
As the countdown continued toward the final cut, Faryniarz was confident he had 
impressed but, as he said, "Once the coaches get in that room, anything can 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Aug. 29, 1988, Faryniarz nervously awaited word on the final roster 
decision. He was waiting at the Quality Inn in Anaheim with free agent David 
Diaz-Infante. Faryniarz was sure both had made the team. Then Diaz-Infante got 
a phone call telling him he'd been released. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on my way out, walking down the hallway and I hear my phone ring," 
Faryniarz said. "Right when I picked it up, they hung up. So I put it down and 
I went to the elevator, and there were about six guys in there with their heads 
down, and I'm acting normal, thinking maybe I made the team. And they said, 
'Yeah, we got the phone call.' And I go, 'Oh, bleep.' " 
</P>
<P>
Faryniarz went to practice anyway, figuring he wasn't leaving until someone 
ordered him off the complex. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived at the front gate, he saw Ray San Jose, the Rams' 
administrative assistant in charge of giving players the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
"He's at the front gate and comes walking up," Faryniarz said. "And I'm looking 
at him. Now, he's either going to say, 'OK, Faryniarz, get your playbook,' or 
he's going to say, 'Hey, how ya' doing.' And he said 'How ya' doing' and I 
said, 'Just great!' " 
</P>
<P>
Faryniarz walked through the gates into paradise. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like walking down that aisle, where you go from the Russian border to 
the American Embassy," he said. "I was thinking, 'Are they going to shoot me or 
what?' " 
</P>
<P>
They didn't shoot. Instead, they gave Faryniarz No. 51, a real linebacker's 
number. Dick Butkus' number. 
</P>
<P>
"It meant a lot because I wasn't just kept around because I was paid such a 
high bonus or anything," he said. "They had no strings. I could have been 
terminated as fast as they got me. It meant a lot to me that they released some 
people that they put some money into to keep me. I've always been like an 
underdog, and it's kind of fun." 
</P>
<P>
He played mostly special teams during the season, but managed one game-saving 
sack to preserve the Rams' 12-10 victory over the Saints in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
On third and three at the Rams' 10, Faryniarz sacked quarterback Bobby Hebert 
for a six-yard loss with 4:01 left, forcing the Saints to settle for a field 
goal, which left them two points short of victory. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the highlight play in my life," he said. "I had something like that 
in college, but this is the pros. Everyone sees it." 
</P>
<P>
Faryniarz is glad he never gave up on himself, despite the opinions of 
well-paid draft analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my doubts as a free agent," he said. "I thought I should have been 
drafted, but once they pass you by, you think, 'Well, maybe they do know what 
they're doing when they draft, so you got to respect that.' But there are 
always a few you overlook." 
</P>
<P>
The few and the proud. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was missed because I was only about 215 pounds the spring before my 
senior year," he said. "That's when the scouts came out and timed us and 
weighed us, so they figured I was underweight as a pre-combine list or a future 
draft choice." 
</P>
<P>
That's old news. The important thing was that Faryniarz fought hard and made 
the team. Maybe next year the coach will get his name right. 
</P>
<P>
"Robinson still calls me FARINYERZ," he said, not complaining a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The team added fifth-round cornerback Alfred Jackson and eighth-round guard 
Warren Wheat to the list of signed draft choices, leaving seven unsigned. It's 
a big seven, though, with two first-round picks and three seconds in that 
group. The Rams also announced the signings of free agent tight end Gary 
Knudson from Arizona State and runing back Vince Weathersby from the University 
of Washington.. . . Until the arrival in camp of Greg Bell and first-round 
choice Cleveland Gary -- and it may be awhile -- second-year runners Gaston 
Green and Robert Delpino will share the tailback position. Delpino played 
fullback last season, but Coach John Robinson wants to expand his options. "We 
really want to see Delpino as a runner," he said.

CALLENDER'S LEGAL BATTLE WITH RAMADA CONTINUES; 
</P>
<P>
PIE-CHAIN FOUNDER PERMITTED TO SELL HOLDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Donald W. Callender, founder of the Marie Callender Pie Shops chain, can sell 
his 2.5 million shares of Ramada Inc. stock, an Orange County Superior Court 
judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
But the preliminary order issued Thursday by Judge Eileen C. Moore does not end 
Callender's legal skirmishes with Ramada. 
</P>
<P>
And according to Robert Crockett, an attorney for Ramada, restrictions remain 
on the number of shares Callender can sell each month without first getting 
Ramada's approval. 
</P>
<P>
The court order stems from a long-simmering dispute between Callender and 
Ramada over the terms of a 1986 agreement in which the pie-and-sandwich chain's 
founder sold the company to Ramada for nearly $57 million in cash and Ramada 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Callender, in turn, agreed not to sell any of his Ramada shares until May, 
1990, when he could sell 1 million shares. The remaining 1.5 million shares 
could not be sold until May, 1991, under the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Since selling the chain, Callender has filed four lawsuits accusing Ramada, a 
Phoenix-based hotel and casino company, of fraud and failing to live up to its 
obligations under the 1986 sale contract. Ramada has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramada sold the Marie Callender chain to Wilshire Restaurant Group 
Inc. for about $54.5 million in May. The transaction was part of a 
restructuring by Ramada, in which the company's hotel and restaurant businesses 
are being sold. 
</P>
<P>
On April 17, Ramada agreed to sell its 800 hotels to New World Development Co. 
Ltd. of Hong Kong for $540 million. A shareholder meeting to approve the 
transaction is scheduled for July 31, and the sale is expected to be completed 
within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Callender sought court approval to sell his Ramada shares because he wanted to 
be able to sell the stock before the hotels are sold. "Every other shareholder 
can sell right now if (he or she) wants to," said Callender's lawyer, Robert 
Waier of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Don Callender "certainly doesn't intend at this point to cast all of his 2.5 
million Ramada shares into the open market," Waier said. 
</P>
<P>
Waier said he does not know how many shares of Ramada Callender actually plans 
to sell. 
</P>
<P>
What is certain, according to the attorney, is that the court order prevents 
Ramada from trying to enforce any contractual restrictions that would prevent 
Callender from selling his 6.3% stake in the company. With the court order, 
"they can't withhold their consent," Waier said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
But Crockett, Ramada's lawyer, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Crockett, a provision of the 1986 contract bars Callender from 
selling more than 100,000 Ramada shares within a 30-day period without the 
company's consent. With the court order, "he can now sell less than 100,000 
shares" at a time on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
Ramada's lawyer said the company "has no position" on whether it would allow 
Callender to sell more than 100,000 shares per month. But he added that if 
Callender asks Ramada for permission to sell more than that at a time, the 
dispute could end up back in court. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County lawsuit, which actually is two consolidated cases, is 
scheduled to begin trial on Nov. 27 to address other issues still in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
A second trial is set to begin on Nov. 21 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles 
concerning Callender's alleged failure to pay franchise fees on eight 
restaurants. A class action suit by Callender also is pending in Orange County 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Callender has about 150 restaurants in 17 states. Of those, 105 are in 
California.

Phoenix Group, a Newport Beach investment company headed by entrepreneur 
Charles Missler, said Friday that it has purchased Netcom Research Inc., a 
Fountain Valley maker of computer workstations. 
</P>
<P>
The current value of the purchase is less than $100,000, but the sellers could 
receive as much as $1 million depending on the company's future performance, 
said Netcom spokesman Charles Harrocks. 
</P>
<P>
Harrocks also said Netcom will hire eight new employees in the next five months 
and that present management will remain.

Phoenix will attempt to combine Netcom's technology with telecommunications 
equipment made by Resdel Engineering Corp., an Irvine subsidiary of Resdel 
Industries, which is mostly owned by Phoenix. Resdel is a maker of 
anti-submarine warfare communications equipment. CHARLES STROUSE

HAMMOND CO. PAYS OUT $2 MILLION IN TENDER OFFER FOR 13.5% OF ITS STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Hammond Co., a Newport Beach mortgage banking firm, paid out more than $2 
million Friday to complete its successful tender offer for 13.5% of its own 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
The company paid $5 a share to acquire the stock, which consists of 275,000 
shares from the public and 130,000 shares from Thomas T. Hammond, the company's 
chairman. The latter's stake in the company remains 32%. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing the total number of shares outstanding is a well-established method 
for a company to bolster its stock price when it believes the shares are 
undervalued. Hammond stock closed Friday at $4 a share, unchanged for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Because more shares were tendered than Hammond had sought, the company ended up 
buying 76.4% of each shareholder's tender. That is a result of the Dutch 
auction rules under which the tender offer was made. 
</P>
<P>
Under a Dutch auction, shareholders offer their stock at prices within the 
range set by the company. The company then accumulates the stock, beginning 
with shares tendered at the lowest bids and working up the ladder until it 
reaches its target number of shares. But it pays all shareholders the price per 
share it took to acquire the last share needed. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond had offered to pay between $4 and $5 for each share.

THE CEREMONY OF DRILL: ART AND RITUAL, PERFORMED WITH SNAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY ALLEN, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How glorious: all the fine young men marching across the lawns of Washington -- 
Ft. Myer, the Ellipse, the Iwo Jima Memorial, the Marine Barracks and so on. It 
is summer now, and time for the evening parades and twilight tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
How sad, too: Close-order drill is a ritual from a lost era, like fox hunting. 
It is a souvenir of both the 18th-Century dream of a clockwork universe and the 
ancient Greek dream of a world in which wars would be decided by courage and 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like they're robots," an eighth-grader named Arnaud Voermans said 
recently, as he watched the sentries at the Tomb of the Unknowns do their 
ponderous strut through a light rain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like they're walking on air," said Jennifer Willett, a classmate at 
Brigantine North School in New Jersey. They were here on a class trip. They had 
just laid a wreath in front of the tomb. Now they watched the sentry march 21 
paces back and forth, a floating robot, a mechanical ghost who executed each 
step on the side of his foot, not the heel, then rolled the foot in, each foot 
touching a single imaginary line, as if he were not only walking a tightrope 
but trying to do it without waking anybody up. 
</P>
<P>
This is the gait of ceremonial drill, a gait practiced by both the Army and the 
Marines -- the Marines call it "slide and glide." The idea is to keep the head 
from bobbing, to get men and rifles moving together with an evenness that looks 
lethally self-conscious. It's part of the infinitely detailed aesthetics of 
American drill, delicate and implacable at the same time, a balancing of 
rigidity and ease. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, drill is part of the city's life, like the theater in New York. 
Troops have always gone through "the usual maneuvers in a masterly manner," in 
the words of a newspaper describing the Marines parading past Thomas Jefferson 
on July 4, 1801. The ritual at the Tomb of the Unknowns will end only when 
America ends. Dress-blues platoons slide through the winter twilights of 
inaugural parades like Kodachrome ghosts with their red ears and white gloves, 
the same white gloves that fold flags over coffins at Arlington National 
Cemetery, in the manner of the disembodied hands that appear in cartoons to 
paint a picture across the screen, although at Arlington Cemetery the picture 
is a flag that gets smaller and smaller until it is nothing but a fat triangle 
of blue stars being handed to a widow. 
</P>
<P>
Heels crack -- Army heels, at least, with the metal clickers on them. The 
Marines don't do that. They bang rifle butts, however. When done well, a 
platoon of rifle butts at once, this movement makes a crisp crashing noise. 
When done very well, on the concrete troop walk at 8th and I streets, it makes 
a sort of wet pop, like the sound of a bone breaking. 
</P>
<P>
The command for this is "order arms." 
</P>
<P>
HHhhO . . . Oooorrderrr . . . Then comes an utterance that is theoretically the 
word "arms." Actually, it is a hoarse bark that is driven upward by the 
officer's diaphragm with such pneumatic force that you expect to see a wisp of 
vapor trailing from his mouth like the mist from a pop-top soda can. 
</P>
<P>
The butts come down. The Friday night audience at the Marine Barracks goes, 
"Ahh." 
</P>
<P>
Drill teaches discipline but it no longer moves troops across battlefields. It 
is a technology that has become art by virtue of its uselessness. It is a 
sacrament for remembering heroes and burying our dead. It is performed all over 
America: by Girl Scouts in berets doing the endless, earnest shuffle of dress 
right, dress; by color guards marching out at the start of banquets, bridge 
dedications and playoff games to do that slow, wheeling high-step reminiscent 
of pistons working inside some old ship's engine room; by ROTC types in chromed 
helmet liners and sunglasses, and by old American Legion guys who fire a ragged 
salute on Memorial Day while little kids crawl around their feet, grabbing the 
ejected brass shells. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Navy, the Air Force and the Coast Guard have their color 
guards and drill teams, but the serious drill is done by the Army and the 
Marines. 
</P>
<P>
They hold each other in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to know about drill, there's two places you ask," says Marine 
Gunnery Sgt. D.L. Hall. "The Marines of 8th and I, and Black &amp; Decker." 
</P>
<P>
Says Army Sgt. 1st Class James P. Savage, at Ft. Myer: "I can show you Marines 
when we have joint-service ceremonies, you got to beat it into them with a 
baseball bat. The Army is the senior service, much as the Marines don't like to 
hear it. In the Military District of Washington, the Army will be the overseer 
of ceremonies." 
</P>
<P>
"In the winter, they wear earmuffs," says a Marine sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
"The Marines have done a good job of advertising themselves," says Army Maj. 
Tom Askins. 
</P>
<P>
The Army and Marines work with the same commands and basic movements. Their art 
is founded on the ideal of perfection, an 18th-Century aesthetic that got 
buried in the great landfill of 19th-Century romanticism and 20th-Century 
modernism, whose Promethean struggle and alienated individualism are not 
encouraged by drill instructors. 
</P>
<P>
Army Staff Sgt. James White gets a biblical lilt in his voice as he stands in a 
parking lot addressing a platoon of young soldiers who are learning to drill 
the Ft. Myer way: "Everything needs to be precise. When it's precise, then we 
create precision. Who has to make a correction and who does not have to make a 
correction? Who has accomplished the mission? Who got it right the first time? 
I want to hear one pop, all together." 
</P>
<P>
You see and hear perfection when drill has a quality that gets described with 
words like "tight" or "locked on" or "crispy" or "snap." The 14th revised 
edition of the Guidebook for Marines defines "snap" as: "In commands or 
signals, the quality that inspires immediate response. In drill, the immediate 
and smart execution of movement." 
</P>
<P>
Snap is to drill as swing is to jazz, an unmeasurable but conspicuous precision 
that gives you a rush you have to feel to understand. It can happen toward the 
end of basic training, when your platoon is out drilling for the millionth time 
and suddenly it comes together, it feels like the moment when your airplane 
lifts off the ground, a smoothness, a sense of possibility and infinite vista, 
oddly enough, given the fact that all you can see is the head of the man in 
front of you, the stubbled phrenology of the military world view. Nothing can 
stop you, and you can't do anything wrong. Power and virtue, together at last, 
rifles cracking from shoulder to shoulder. The men in front of you wheel into a 
column left, the platoon curling 90 degrees with the deft tidiness of a Slinky 
going downstairs. You know that when you hit the pivot point you'll turn with 
the same bite. It has a satisfaction that verges on the smug. 
</P>
<P>
Snap comes from attention to detail: the thumbtacks holding the cloth tight on 
a dress cap; the corsets that the Army wears -- for back support, they say, but 
it's hard to imagine they haven't noticed the look that they create; the safety 
pins at the waists of trousers to get the bottoms just touching the shoes, but 
never breaking; the blacking on the bottoms of shoes; white gloves in a perfect 
row down a rank standing at parade rest; the men on burial details lifting 
weights six hours a day and drilling with empty caskets so that the full ones 
float from church to hearse to grave with the rectilinear ease of a cursor 
moving across a computer screen. At Eighth and I, the Marines rehearse the 
evening parade twice each Friday morning, with critiquers scoring the execution 
of each command, then reviewing the second rehearsal on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Members of ceremonial drill units usually stand within an inch of six feet 
tall. Even those differences are hidden by lining men up by height, front to 
back and right to left. If a man lowers his head too far when looking down to 
fix bayonets, he is taught not to correct himself even a fraction of inch, lest 
there be a visible shift in the crescent of light reflecting from the visor of 
his dress cap. Better to be wrong and look right than the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
One civilian in 10,000 can see the differences between Marine and Army drill, 
but they are profound and philosophical, like the differences between the 
Spartans and the Athenians. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines favor a severely classical drill, a style that impresses you with 
its modesty, not its difficulties. It values clarity and directness (with 
occasional bits of bombast like the spotlighted bugler playing taps on the 
Barracks parapet). It is Apollonian to the point of being forbidding, of 
Blake's "fearful symmetry." To the Army, it may well look mechanical to the 
point of arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
Army ceremonial drill has more texture to it. Rifle butts ease to the ground. 
There's a tendency to add a subliminal curve here, a hint of a pause there, 
until the simplest of gestures, such as a salute by the corporal of the guard 
at the Tomb of the Unknowns, acquires a mysterious gravity. In facing 
movements, heels may flare out a little more than necessary -- a mannerist 
touch that comes from the same instinct that leads boys to customize cars. The 
slide and glide of the Tomb sentries can have a catlike delicacy. To Marine 
purists, it may look a little cute. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the Army decided that flag details were folding flags too 
quickly at the ends of funerals. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to do it in 60 seconds. It was too showboaty," says Staff Sgt. Kenneth 
Moomey. "We shoot for 90 seconds on the flag fold. We're averaging 88 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Drill is both art and ritual -- art in its working out of meaningful forms, 
ritual in the way that it is intended to change not just the people who do it 
but the people who see it. (Gen. George Patton said in 1945: "Ceremonies are 
important as a means of impressing our enemies, our allies and our own 
troops.") Drill also fits into a category that anthropologist John M. Roberts 
calls "judged display," like figure skating, the Miss America pageant, or jams 
and jellies at the state fair. On the other hand, we don't think of judged 
displays as having larger, metaphorical meaning, the way drill does. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter that we can't quite define drill. Its meaning is so clear in 
our minds that we never question it. Anthropologists, sociologists and 
psychologists don't study it. (Imagine the dissertations that would fill 
libraries if close-order drill were done by the Eskimos or 19th-Century slum 
dwellers or the insane.) We take it for granted, maybe because it has been part 
of Western thinking at least since the ancient Greeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The Greeks believed they were morally superior because of the way they 
fought," says Victor Hanson, author of a new book called "The Western Way of 
War-Infantry Battle in Classical Greece." Drill was a practical matter of 
teaching troops to fight in the tight formations called phalanxes, which drove 
over their enemies by sheer pushing power and discipline. "The way they did 
drill was more complicated than it is now, but they did it in cadence, like us, 
with flute players setting the time, and a large variety of commands -- raise 
spears, relax spears, that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the persistent legend that wily American sharpshooters defeated the 
British in their drilled formations, George Washington recognized early on that 
the war could not be won by farmers hiding behind trees. He asked Baron von 
Steuben to take Frederick the Great's drill and make it suitable for his 
volunteers. Von Steuben believed that each country's drill should reflect the 
"natural genius" of its people, hence the American style with its ordinary 
gestures and common-man simplicity, as opposed to the German goose step, or the 
huge and hearty arm swing of the British. When American drill is good it looks 
effortless. 
</P>
<P>
Western soldiers continued to fight in drilled formations until about the time 
of the American Civil War, when rifling increased the range and accuracy of 
military muskets so radically that troops were slaughtered if they did not take 
cover. The mass use of the machine gun in World War I was the final blow to 
most stand-up maneuvering by troops under fire, although British generals 
thought it suitable for the Battle of the Somme, in which 14,000 troops, 
advancing at a walk, were killed in the first 10 minutes of the battle. 
</P>
<P>
Still, we do it. Drill has remained as the cheapest item on the basic-training 
curriculum, and as a means of teaching discipline and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance of close-order drill could not be overestimated," writes Col. 
David Hackworth, the most-decorated hero of Vietnam, in his autobiography, 
"About Face." He recalls: "I was so proud to be a cog in that finely tuned 
machine. I loved the discipline: the relentless repetition -- basic drills 
reinforced again and again -- that conditioned a soldier to react to orders not 
only on the parade field but on the battlefield as well." 
</P>
<P>
It is an art of obedience, not responsibility. You do what you're told, and 
only what you're told. A million recruits have heard the preparatory command 
"forward" and have stepped off expecting "march," only to find themselves 
walking across a parade field in a silence that will be broken by a sergeant 
shouting, "Do not anticipate the command."

SOME WAYS TO GET YOUR CHILD OFF THE COUCH AND INTO SHAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRI KOBREN, Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The adults of America are on a fitness kick -- jogging, swimming, biking, 
pumping iron, filling up health clubs and making sports-shoe manufacturers 
rich. Mornings, you find us in the malls, walking briskly. Evenings, we're on 
the street, marching off our low-fat, high-fiber dinners. 
</P>
<P>
The children of America are different. 
</P>
<P>
"The fitness boom has not filtered down to children," declares Raymond Stinar, 
associate professor of physical education at Maryland's Towson State 
University. Studies by the federal government, by the physical education 
teachers of America and by private researchers show that too many of our 
children are overweight, inflexible, muscularly weak and lacking in aerobic 
endurance. 
</P>
<P>
They can't run for 20 minutes, haven't the upper-body strength for push-ups and 
chin-ups, aren't flexible enough to touch their toes when they sit on the floor 
with their legs straight out in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Stinar says, the tests that determine youngsters' status actually 
might be adding to the problem: Children who couldn't achieve high performance 
scores might have been turned off from activity. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason the fitness boom for adults took off is that the activities are 
basically non-competitive; people could use themselves as the standard," 
explains Charles Kuntzleman, a Michigan-based physical educator, author and 
creator of fitness curricula. "But with kids, we haven't done that. We're 
setting them up for failure because we're always trying to get them to excel." 
</P>
<P>
The sociological situation has also made them sedentary. They're bused to and 
from school, they sit all day at their desks and then go home and sit some more 
in front of a TV, video game or computer. A lot of parents consider that safer 
than having their children playing on streets or playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers, who might have supervised the play a generation ago, are working 
themselves now. And fathers, who used to have evenings Think about it: When was 
the last time you saw the kids in your neighborhood lined up to jump 
double-dutch or red-hot-peppers? Or watched them race a football across three 
back yards? Or found a hopscotch they'd chalked on the sidewalk? 
</P>
<P>
and weekends off for family fun and games, are now helping with the housework 
and grocery shopping. 
</P>
<P>
But the situation isn't entirely bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"About 20% of children have adopted a healthy life style," Kuntzleman says. 
"They're involved in sports. They're running, swimming, going to programs at 
the Y, getting quality physical education at school. And if you banned physical 
education from the schools, that 20% would still find a way to be active." 
</P>
<P>
There are no hard-and-fast rules, of course, but to many observers it seems 
that a lot of the active youngsters have active parents. 
</P>
<P>
"When mom and dad are involved in activity, that's a life style they pass on to 
the children," says Neal MacDonald, director of operations at Baltimore's Union 
Memorial Sports Medicine Center. 
</P>
<P>
Stinar agrees: "If a parent wants to produce fit kids, he or she has to be 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
That means going out and biking with them instead of taking them to the 
fast-food store in the car. It means the whole family walking in the evenings 
instead of plopping down on the sofa to watch TV. And it may also mean playing 
with them instead of just telling them to go play. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are, they don't know how. 
</P>
<P>
Think about it: When was the last time you saw the kids in your neighborhood 
lined up to jump double-dutch or red-hot-peppers or other rope-jumping games? 
Or watched them race a football across three back yards? Or found a hopscotch 
they had chalked on the sidewalk? 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are poor game-players," Stinar says. "They don't know how to play by 
themselves or in small groups. We've organized all their free time for them." 
</P>
<P>
Physical education teachers can, of course, teach games and encourage lifetime, 
non-competitive activities. But when P.E. classes meet no more often than twice 
a week in most elementary schools, teachers just don't have enough time to 
create fit kids, Stinar suggests. Parents must find a way to pick up the slack 
-- and not, the experts say, by setting up more league-type sports. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids should play with other kids. The idea is to have parents give them 
instruction and occasionally do family things," says Kuntzleman, whose book, 
"Healthy Kids for Life," urges parents to build fitness activities into their 
children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
Give them bikes and Pogo sticks, he suggests. Celebrate their birthdays with an 
activity, rather than just ice cream and cake. Spend part of your vacation time 
in a family activity -- swimming, sailing, walking, backpacking. Help the 
junior jocks find the right sport, which might not be your sport or another 
child's sport, and show the less-athletic kids the joys of non-competitive 
activities in which the goal is to increase endurance rather than to win races. 
Reward progress with a T-shirt or sweat band, "which really rings the kid's 
bell," he advises, but don't try to push your children to do more than their 
minds and bodies can handle. 
</P>
<P>
"The 4-, 5-, 6-year-old can't run three miles," he warns. "But he can spend 
some time on his scooter, and some on his bike, and run for a while, too, and 
cover the distance." 
</P>
<P>
Reward activity with more activity, suggests Linda Vanderhoff, executive 
director of the Maryland Commission on Physical Fitness. Have everyone in the 
family establish a personal goal -- an increase in time or distance walked, for 
instance -- and when they have all met it, celebrate with a family hike or 
visit to the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Unstuff your shirt and join the games. "You'll find it's fun, the children will 
enjoy it and activity will continue," Stinar says. 
</P>
<P>
There are just a couple of cautions. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people would argue that kids could get hurt doing adult activities," 
MacDonald says. "But for the most part, kids will stop if they start feeling 
uncomfortable or bored. I think kids' bodies are a little more 'forgiving' than 
adults' bodies. It's probably safer for kids to do adult sports than for adults 
to do kids' sports." 
</P>
<P>
"At 6, 7, 8 years old, a child can jog so long as he doesn't push himself to 
the point that it's too intense, or that it's drudgery," Stinar says. "A lot of 
research has shown that strenuous activity doesn't harm kids, but that if 
they're not enjoying it, it can turn them off."

MEN SHOULD START TALKING ABOUT CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELISE T. CHISOLM, Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My good friend Betsy -- not her real name -- found out she had breast cancer 
six months ago and has told a few of us all about it. She is coping well after 
treatment, and her disease is in remission. 
</P>
<P>
My friend Alex -- not his real name -- has prostate cancer and isn't talking 
about it. He has never told anyone but his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason I know he has it is that his wife told me; she needed someone 
with whom she could talk. She was horrified at first. "Why him?" she asked. 
After the tears, the worry set in. His problem was also diagnosed six months 
ago, and his cancer, like Betsy's, is in remission after radiation treatment. 
But Alex is losing his ability to perform sexually, and he and his wife are 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
Both Betsy and Alex have a good chance of living long and happy lives. Betsy's 
mental attitude is great. She is buoyant and hopeful. But Alex is quiet and 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Some of my best friends have had breast cancer. Most of them have beaten the 
disease. And apparently, some of my best male friends have had prostate cancer 
and I just never knew it. I feel sorry about that. I would have liked to have 
sent cards, offered prayers and hope for them and their families. As most of us 
have learned, cancer affects the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
142,900 New Cases 
</P>
<P>
One out of 10 women in the United States will get breast cancer. The American 
Cancer Society estimates that there will be 142,900 new cases this year. And an 
estimated 103,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in the United 
States in 1989. About one out of 11 men will develop the disease. 
</P>
<P>
I am so proud of women. Where once they could not talk about that area of their 
body, now they can. We talk about mammograms and breast examinations as 
routinely as if they were just dental checks. That is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
From Julia Child and Betty Ford to Shirley Temple Black, women who have 
survived breast cancer have told their stories of pain and gain, and the road 
to wellness. 
</P>
<P>
If you did not see NBC's "The Ann Jillian Story" or "Destined to Live," you 
missed wonderful stories. "Destined to Live" was hosted by Jill Eikenberry from 
"L.A. Law," herself a breast cancer patient, and this docudrama wasn't medical, 
it was more philosophical and personal. 
</P>
<P>
Jill talked to many famous women -- Nancy Reagan, Gloria Steinem -- housewives 
and career women about their bouts with cancer, and then the film cut to her 
elderly aunt who had cancer years ago, and how her faith had held her together 
and she had overcome. 
</P>
<P>
I was so impressed with the courage and positive attitude of these women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not So Grim 
</P>
<P>
The statistics on breast cancer are not as grim as they once were. Localized 
breast cancer is nearly 100% curable today, and the same is true of prostate 
cancer in men. 
</P>
<P>
But now I want to tell you why I think it is important to be like Betsy with 
her cancer rather than like Alex. 
</P>
<P>
First, Alex's wife thinks he would be much better off if he talked about his 
illness -- the treatment and the prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
I realize that men have been conditioned to keep things about their sexuality 
to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Some people don't even know where the prostate gland is. Although men can and 
do brag about sexual prowess, they do not want to talk about impotence, much 
less admit it. The old saw that "men don't cry and women are the weaker sex" 
still flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
Prostate cancer is, also, not always the end of a man's ability to perform 
sexually, but many men are macho about being ill, almost cloistered -- and 
especially so if it represents an affront to their manhood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proven Wrong 
</P>
<P>
Women who are afraid they will lose their sexuality because of breast cancer 
and mastectomy have been proved wrong and have found out that breasts are not 
the only things that make them attractive or desirable. 
</P>
<P>
I guess what I am saying is that men go by a double standard. They might talk 
about their wives' recuperation from breast surgery at a party, but you don't 
hear them talk in a group about their "prostate trouble" or prostate cancer in 
a serious way. There is still that bravado. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing Alex, I think it would be much better if he knew that we all know he is 
ill and suffering from fear and doubt. 
</P>
<P>
People who can talk about their illnesses are much better off psychologically. 
Denial is normal at first, but you can't go forward with it. Support from loved 
ones is essential. 
</P>
<P>
My friend Alex suffers alone, and I hate that. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I'm being a little hard on men, but even Dr. John Laszlo, author of 
"Understanding Cancer," admits there is an unneeded "shamefacedness to prostate 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Have to Kill 
</P>
<P>
I recommend this excellent book for its candor and its information on the 
emotional side of dealing with cancer. Cancer kills 460,000 Americans annually, 
but it doesn't have to, and now we know that. Four out of 10 patients who get 
cancer this year will be alive five years after diagnosis.

PERSONAL WATERCRAFT RIDERS CUT WAKE OF INJURIES, IRKED BOATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BRUSKE, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ANNAPOLIS, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Take one seaworthy snowmobile with a gas-powered engine that will make it go up 
to 40 m.p.h., and you have the latest rage -- or annoyance, some say -- on the 
nation's recreational waters. 
</P>
<P>
Known by brand names such as Jet Ski or Wet Jet, these marine motorcycles are 
generating huge sales for their manufacturers and rising concern among boaters 
and officials in several states. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers like to describe these highly maneuverable aquatic hot rods as 
"personal watercraft." But marine police have an unprintable term for them. 
Last year, 20 people were killed in personal watercraft accidents nationwide -- 
a fourfold increase from 1987 -- and 254 were injured, according to the U.S. 
Coast Guard. Several serious accidents, but no deaths, were reported in 
Maryland waters. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you about these darn things," said angry Annapolis area boater 
Yvonne Gilder, who, like many other pleasure-craft owners, already has a 
collection of horror stories. Gilder tells of being harassed by aggressive 
personal watercraft drivers, some of whom get their thrills by jumping over the 
wakes of other boats or racing in tight circles in congested waterways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inherently Safe 
</P>
<P>
But even critics agree on one thing when personal watercraft are compared with 
the "all terrain vehicle," the three-wheeled, off-road motorcycle banned after 
design problems were linked to hundreds of deaths. By most accounts, personal 
watercraft are inherently safe and manage to withstand the worst abuse. It's 
just that they are driven too often by joy riders who don't give a lick for 
safety or common boating courtesies, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem we're facing is not the equipment. It's the people who are 
operating them that's the problem," said Al Simon, chairman of Maryland's Boat 
Act Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Some personal watercraft owners think they're getting a bum rap because of a 
few bad apples. Simon and other officials, trying to quell the open warfare 
that has sprung up between the personal watercraft crowd and owners of bigger 
craft, this month will consider imposing several restrictions because of the 
growing number of accidents and complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland Department of Natural Resources police said they receive up to a dozen 
complaints about mischievous PWs each weekend. "They come out like a swarm of 
bees," said department police Maj. Frank Wood. "They're out riding them like a 
toy in a real boating environment." 
</P>
<P>
Most drivers, many of them teen-agers, don't wear helmets. "There is no 
protection on a PW," said Natural Resources police Cpl. Randy Whitter. "If the 
PW hits something, you're going to hit it, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Deaths in Florida 
</P>
<P>
The nation's worst problems with personal watercraft are in Florida, where 11 
of last year's 20 deaths occurred. The latest death under investigation is that 
of a 9-year-old boy who was driving a craft when he was struck and run over by 
a second scooter operated by a 33-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
Florida plans to implement several new rules, including a ban on nighttime use 
and wake-jumping and a minimum age requirement of 14 for owners and 16 for 
renters. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are thrill seekers," Simon said. "It's scary, and there's no law 
against it." 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers refuse to say how many personal watercraft are in use. But 
dreading a repeat of the all terrain vehicle debacle, which wiped out millions 
of dollars in profits, the industry has mounted a safety campaign, offering to 
cooperate with state regulators and distributing literature and training films 
to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone has recognized it is a usage problem. We're dealing with 
people who buy these machines and are not traditional, experienced boaters," 
said Douglas Freeman, spokesman for Kawasaki, which makes Jet Ski. "We 
recognize the fact there is a significant number who are not familiar with 
traditional boating regulations." 
</P>
<P>
Bad publicity has stung dealers sorely, but they say sales are still soaring. 
"We give people pamphlets. We beg them to please use the machine responsibly," 
said Alan Cohen, general manager of Cycle World near Baltimore. "But once they 
leave the door, they do what they're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Personal watercraft have one safety advantage over other motorized watercraft: 
no propeller. They are driven instead by a high-powered stream of water, hence 
the use of "jet" in some brand names. Prices begin around $2,000.

PHOTOGRAPHY: IT TAKES PLANNING, A KEEN EYE AND LUCK TO CAPTURE THE BIG PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You hear the crack of a ball against Bo Jackson's bat and, if luck is on your 
side, you get the picture. However, it takes a little luck, because as a 
professional photographer you may just as likely be focusing on the pitcher at 
that crucial moment. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is one of the most difficult sports to shoot because its long periods 
of inactivity lull you into a false sense of security. Then, in a split second, 
the third baseman makes a dive for a ball rocketing down the third-base line. 
Or perhaps the center-fielder and shortstop collide in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
There are things you do have control over -- such as focus, exposure, 
composition and timing -- but then you also have to worry about being blocked 
by the batboy, the umpire, the on-deck batter or the first-base or third-base 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Major League Baseball All-Star game, which was played Tuesday at Anaheim 
Stadium, is a good example of the trials and tribulations professional 
photographers must go through on an almost daily basis. There were 748 members 
of the media covering the game, 70 of whom were photographers. 
</P>
<P>
The preparation for the game was typical of what photographers go through to 
get pictures of an event in the next morning's paper. 
</P>
<P>
The day started about 1 p.m., even though the game didn't start until 5:30 p.m. 
First there was the planning meeting attended by all photographers and film 
editors. Things such as messenger pickup for film, game-shooting strategy and 
the type of film to be used were discussed and decided on. 
</P>
<P>
All the pictures were shot in color, even though most would appear as black and 
white in the morning newspaper. Kodak Panalure paper was used for making 
black-and-white photographs from color negatives. 
</P>
<P>
A lottery was held to determine which photographers would shoot from what 
locations. The best shooting locations are the field-level spots on both sides 
of the dugout. Those locations provide the best shooting angle of second base, 
third base and home. 
</P>
<P>
The photographers arrived at the stadium at 2:30 p.m. As usual, there were 
plenty of photo opportunities both inside and outside the stadium. For example, 
outside the stadium you could take pictures of vendors, tailgate parties and -- 
on this July night -- parking attendants wearing tuxedo shirts and ties. There 
was even a booth making personalized baseball cards. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the stadium, the players were warming up and taking batting practice. 
There was little spontaneity because of the crush of photographers all trying 
to get the same pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The talk at game time was about how difficult it would be for the batters at 
twilight. It's no different for photographers who have to deal with half the 
field in sunlight and the other half in shade. You can't just pop up a strobe 
and fill the picture in with fill-in flash. The action is too far away. 
</P>
<P>
The big play of this night came early -- Bo Jackson's home run in the first 
inning -- which is not normally the case. The best angle for this picture was 
the first-base photo well. It showed Jackson swinging and then watching the 
ball fly out of the stadium. There was a smattering of action the rest of the 
game, but it was clear that Jackson's home run was the picture everyone wanted 
to see. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Jackson came out of the dugout to receive his Most Valuable 
Player trophy. It's a moment that most athletes hate but most photographers 
want. In this case, Jackson stayed for about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball pictures look as if they are spontaneous, but they actually require a 
lot of preparation. Photographers get only one chance to shoot a picture, so 
they want to make the very best of that chance. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it requires a little luck.
