Are two of the prerequisites for participation in the game show "Win, Lose or 
Draw" that one should be devoid of all drawing ability and possess absolutely 
no knowledge of the geography of the world? On a recent show, the performance 
of a young female rock star was nothing short of pathetic. On the whole, I find 
the show an embarrassment as the celebrities' and contestants' deficiencies are 
revealed before thousands of viewers. What schools have these people attended?

KTTV should be complimented for airing the funeral mass of Cardinal Timothy 
Manning live and without commercials on June 29. The ceremony was handled in a 
dignified and informative manner by the stations' commentators. Channel 11 did 
the Los Angeles community a fine public service by preempting its regular 
programming to air an important and affecting event.

EYEWITNESS AT TIAN AN MEN SQUARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Edward A. Gargan, the Beijing bureau chief for the New 
York Times from 1986 to 1988, was in Beijing from mid-May until June 22 
researching a book about economic and political change in China. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A YOUNG STUDENT, HIS GLASSES a bit askew, his clothes wrinkled and unwashed, 
waved at me from under the army-green awning of his tent on Beijing's Tian An 
Men Square on Saturday afternoon, June 3. He looked tired, the weariness of the 
past weeks of marches, hunger strikes and speeches slowing his words, weighing 
his shoulders down. He motioned me into the tent, lifting the strand of twine 
that demarcated the inner sanctum of his university's encampment. We stepped 
over soiled padded mattresses and patterned cotton quilts and settled onto low, 
three-legged stools in a corner. He lit a cigarette from a package I pushed 
toward him and exhaled a cloud of bluish smoke as if expelling a last worry 
from the recesses of his soul. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, students sat on quilts, silently playing cards, the soft slap of 
cardboard on a makeshift table somehow audible through the din of loudspeakers 
in the square. My friend -- he and I had met a week or so earlier as I wandered 
among the tents of Tian An Men Square -- produced two aluminum cans of warm 
soda, a carbonated orange concoction that had become the principal beverage of 
China's democracy movement. We sat quietly. The jubilation of the previous 
weeks, the exhilaration of speaking freely, of proclaiming to the world that 
China, too, wanted democracy, was being gnawed away by uncertainty, by the wait 
for the forces of the state to act. 
</P>
<P>
It had been two weeks since Li Peng, the uncompromising and doctrinaire premier 
whose resignation the Tian An Men demonstrators were demanding, had appeared on 
national television to announce the imposition of martial law in the capital. 
"It must be stressed," Li had said, his face bathed in sweat, stumbling 
occasionally in the harsh staccato delivery of his orders, "that even under 
such circumstances, we should still persist in protecting the patriotism of the 
students, make a clear distinction between them and the very, very few people 
who created the turmoil, and we will not penalize students for their radical 
words and actions in the student movement." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the shadowed cool of the tent, shimmers of heat like crinkled cellophane 
rose from the baked concrete expanse of the square. About 100 feet from where 
we sat, a 30-foot-tall, almost luminescent white statue of a stylized woman, 
her short hair puffed as if by a gust of wind, her hands holding aloft a 
flaming torch, stood amid a small sea of blue and red nylon igloo tents. Four 
ideograms, cut from fabric and sewn on a curtain of white cloth that hung at 
the base of the sculpture, read minzhu zhi shen, the Goddess of Democracy. 
</P>
<P>
I asked my friend about the statue. He nodded as he talked, smiling slightly 
and tugging on his cigarette. He was nervous, more nervous than I had ever seen 
him, and less willing to chat. "Many people have come to see the statue," he 
said. "I think when they see it, they understand. This statue is a symbol 
against feudalism, against anti-democratic tendencies. It is face to face with 
the portrait of Mao Tse-tung. That picture is the face of tyranny. The statue 
represents the mass image of the people." He stopped speaking and I thought it 
best to leave. 
</P>
<P>
That night, the army came, with tanks and guns. I never saw my friend again. 
</P>
<P>
PRELUDE 
</P>
<P>
Friday night and Saturday morning, June 2-3. For two weeks, the people of 
Beijing -- steelworkers, old men with wooden canes, swaggering young taxi 
drivers, aproned shop girls, grandmothers with gray hair wrapped into buns, 
college students in bold T-shirts reading ji shao shu, ji shao shu ("very, very 
few") -- had stopped the Chinese army from entering their city. 
</P>
<P>
They swarmed over the Liberation-brand trucks, arguing, cajoling, pleading with 
the soldiers not to advance, not to raise their weapons against their own 
people. At critical intersections and main trunk roads, barricades of 
red-and-yellow public buses, blue-and-white-striped water trucks, coal trucks 
and garbage trucks blocked the march of the People's Liberation Army into 
Beijing, a city it had taken without firing a shot in the autumn of 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the middle of the night, 5,000 young, unarmed recruits were 
double-timing down Changan Avenue toward Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
The phone jolted me awake. I was staying with another journalist in an 
apartment in Jianguomenwai Compound, the largest of the four walled residential 
areas for diplomats and journalists, on Changan Avenue a little more than a 
mile from Tian An Men Square. It was a reporter, a friend of mine, saying that 
troops were moving from the east. I telephoned two other American journalists, 
and in minutes we were dashing down the stairs -- the elevators, as usual, were 
broken -- and speeding from the compound to catch the army. 
</P>
<P>
In soft-soled boots, the soldiers moved almost silently, just the thump of 
rubber on the asphalt of the six-lane road that slices Beijing in half from 
east to west. They wore white shirts and green pants and carried small 
backpacks and metal thermoses. They moved swiftly, urged on by platoon leaders 
counting cadence in the night air. 
</P>
<P>
It was 2:30 in the morning, yet almost magically, the citizens of Beijing 
materialized on the streets. Youngsters on bicycles swept up the avenue raising 
the alarm, windmilling their arms as they rode. From the hutongs, the alleys 
that burrow into the old residential areas of the capital, people rushed, some 
still in pajamas or nightgowns. 
</P>
<P>
I was in a car full of journalists, and we raced abreast of the jogging troops, 
trying to outrun the column, to witness what we believed would be a major 
confrontation. We screeched into the parking lot of the Beijing Hotel, a few 
hundred yards east of Tian An Men Square, 10 minutes or so ahead of the column 
of soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
I bolted from the car. Looking back, I still could not see the soldiers we had 
passed. At the western edge of the hotel, a convoy of civilian trucks roared 
up, horns blaring, to block the width of Changan Avenue. A wave of applause 
surged through the rapidly filling streets, and bare arms sprouted above the 
sea of heads, two fingers forked in V signs. Then, in front of the hotel, 
students and citizens, men and women, linked arms in a line across the avenue, 
perhaps 50 in all, facing the wave of troops. A young woman with a ponytail and 
glasses was crying, large tears dropping darkly onto her pink blouse. A man who 
put his arm through hers hushed her, "Don't be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Under the hazy yellow glare of street lights, everyone was still. At first 
faintly and then louder, the sound of thousands of pounding feet swept over the 
crowd. A student shouted through a hand-held electronic megaphone, "The whole 
people have stood up," a paraphrase of Mao Tse-tung's line when he declared the 
establishment of the People's Republic some 40 years earlier from atop Tian An 
Men, the Gate of Heavenly Peace. "Let the whole world know." 
</P>
<P>
I circled through the crowds in front of the Beijing Hotel. Cars of foreign 
journalists squeezed through the throng, and the lights of television cameras 
bathed clots of people in eerie white pools. The head of the column came into 
sight, and the line of people across Changan Avenue huddled closer. A chant 
burst from the crowd: "Go back, go back, go back." 
</P>
<P>
As the troops moved forward, still tightly bunched, five or six abreast, in a 
moving river of humanity, the crowd pushed against the column, funneling it 
toward the line of protesters linking arms. Almost instantly, the soldiers were 
swallowed by the mass of people, surrounded like an invading organism and 
pushed back. The young soldiers grabbed each other, their eyes fearful, 
astonished, uncomprehending. They stumbled sideways, backward, the column 
disintegrating into clumps of sweating troops wildly looking about for a place 
to hide. 
</P>
<P>
A soldier fainted next to me, caught by two companions before he fell to the 
pavement. The crowd took up another chant: "Sit down, sit down." Others 
countercalled, "Down with Li Peng." Then, as if on command, the soldiers 
hunched down, some on the street, many more on the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Two teen-agers, perhaps 18, a boy and girl arm in arm, drifted over to me, 
innocence and wonder on their faces. "It's marvelous," the girl said in 
carefully syllabled English. "The people of Beijing are marvelous. I don't 
think these soldiers have ever seen anything like this, never since liberation. 
It's like the Philippines. It's really people power." 
</P>
<P>
The tension of the crowd had dissipated like air rushing from a balloon. It was 
3 o'clock. Once again the people of Beijing had stopped the army from reaching 
Tian An Men Square, from moving against the students who protected the Goddess 
of Democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere, soldiers crouched on the sidewalks or in front of buildings, and 
people talked softly to these frightened youngsters in uniform. "Don't be 
afraid of the people," someone said. "With the people, the country has hope. 
The people don't want you to hurt them." Some soldiers cried, wiping their eyes 
with the backs of their hands. "They're not from Beijing, you know," a man 
pushing a bicycle told me. "They're from Liaoning. They know nothing. They 
don't even know why they are here." 
</P>
<P>
Popsicle vendors maneuvered their wheeled ice chests through the crowds crying, 
"Bing guan, bing guan." Two young women shoved a wad of bills into the hands of 
one and marched off with two cartons filled with popsicles, which they began 
passing out to soldiers huddled along the east side of the Beijing Hotel under 
a propaganda banner reading, "Firmly oppose turmoil. Maintain order and 
stability." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, the young soldiers rose, urged on by the people, and began 
straggling back east on Changan Avenue. I walked with a group of soldiers for 
the first mile, tracing my route home, their ragged retreat cheered by 
bystanders who lined the sidewalks in the predawn hours. Rhythmic clapping and 
laughter carried the soldiers on, out of the heart of Beijing, away from Tian 
An Men Square and what the students called "the throat of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday afternoon and evening, June 3. In my student friend's tent, I 
recounted the events of the previous night. He had slept through it, too 
exhausted to venture over to the Beijing Hotel to witness the river of soldiers 
staunched by a determined citizenry. Like many of the students in the square, 
he possessed a tough optimism, but an optimism that often collapsed into doubt. 
In the space of a few minutes, he would insist that the students would triumph, 
then he would turn gloomy. "I think the Communist Party in China is the shadow 
of feudalism," he said. "They will not compromise with the students. Maybe the 
government will win. They have the guns." 
</P>
<P>
Great swaths of the square, only a week before crowded with blanket-covered 
lean-tos, tents and cardboard shacks, were now empty. Small mounds of discarded 
clothes or books or crumpled quilts dotted the 100-acre field of concrete. 
Still, perhaps a hundred crimson banners of China's colleges and universities 
flapped above the dwindling clusters of settlements. 
</P>
<P>
I walked north from the tent, toward the towering red walls of the Forbidden 
City, an immense portrait of Mao hanging over the central portal, which edges 
Changan Avenue and the northern boundary of the square. Looking to the right, I 
could see the Revolutionary History Museum, and to the left the Great Hall of 
the People. After Mao's death, a blocky columned mausoleum was erected in the 
southern half of the square to display the preserved corpse of the Great 
Helmsman. Curiously, during the entire occupation, the mausoleum remained 
undisturbed. One day, I had even managed to buy from a souvenir seller a blue 
polyester baseball hat imprinted with a rendering of the mausoleum. 
</P>
<P>
On the west side of the Great Hall of the People, a pink-columned edifice where 
the rubber-stamp parliament gathers, a contingent of 5,000 soldiers armed with 
AK-47 assault rifles was surrounded by singing, chanting, hectoring crowds. 
Some soldiers passed their canteens to protesters to have them refilled. Others 
accepted proffered sticks of ice cream. An officer stood and tried to lead his 
troops in song, a futile effort to drown out choruses of the socialist hymn the 
Internationale from the crowd. A student orator lectured the troops. There was 
no sense of crisis, of impending cataclysm. It was, as far as I could tell 
then, another in what had become a series of routine nonviolent victories over 
the army. 
</P>
<P>
I left the square sometime after 6 o'clock, in time to get back to my friend's 
apartment for the half-hour evening television news program, which provided not 
only the sole window into China's leadership but also an excuse to eat. We 
threw together a bowl of pea and bacon soup and some toast. 
</P>
<P>
At precisely 7 o'clock, the broadcast opened with a dour-faced Li Peng, oddly 
attired in a Western jacket and tie, reading a bizarre speech about global 
environmental problems. "What in the hell. . . ?" I muttered. My friend, who 
works for a Hong Kong magazine, had stopped taking notes, the surprise evident 
on his face. Even as Li spoke, it would turn out, armored vehicles were 
grinding into Beijing from the west. 
</P>
<P>
As darkness crept over the city, the streets and boulevards teemed with 
restless, skittish streams of bicyclists and pedestrians. By 8:30, the inner 
city, what was once contained by the old city wall, was electric with tension. 
I walked outside the compound to talk to people pedaling west, toward the 
square. "There's been shooting at Muxidi," someone said, referring to one of 
the distant western districts of the capital. Truckloads of workers in yellow 
hard hats -- looking tough, alert and confident, to my eyes -- sped down the 
Second Ring Road, a six-lane highway that encircles the inner city and skirts 
the diplomatic compound, on their way to man the people's roadblocks, I 
figured. 
</P>
<P>
At the Jianguomenwai Bridge, I watched a procession of about 40 canvas-backed 
army trucks lumber north, jolting to a halt at a roadblock, where they were 
swallowed up by chanting crowds waving fists and V signs. "This isn't the 
people's army, it's a traitor's army," a man shouted as he pounded on the 
fender of an army truck. These troops clutched rifles between their legs. At 
one point, a group of workers burst from the crush around the truck waving 
steel helmets and webbed bandoliers taken from one of the trucks. 
</P>
<P>
THE MASSACRE 
</P>
<P>
Late Saturday and early Sunday. At midnight, while I was doing some work in the 
apartment, I got another phone call. A reporter yelled into my ear, "The army's 
moving from the west." I immediately called two other reporters, one of whom 
had an almost-new Toyota sedan. "Let's go," I shouted. "They're moving on the 
square, the army." I rushed around collecting my camera and notebook. I stuck a 
flask of Scotch in my back pocket, thinking that it might serve as a 
last-recourse antiseptic if someone was shot. 
</P>
<P>
It was impossible to drive across the city on Changan Avenue, now a sea of 
barricades. So we sped north and west on the Second Ring Road, careening 
through roadblocks, a sign in our window reading jizhe -- journalists. As we 
circled the center of the city and headed south toward the Fuxingmen Bridge, 
the commotion in the streets was intense. Bicyclists, who in Beijing usually 
crawl sedately along the road, were tearing along highways and down side 
streets in packs. People were running away from the bridge. We rounded a curve 
that brought the bridge into sight. 
</P>
<P>
A wall of flaming buses down the entire length of the bridge lit the sky like 
day. The reporter driving the car slammed on the brakes, sliding the car into 
the curb along the highway. We ran, crouched over, toward the on-ramp that led 
to the inferno. The other two reporters hung back, talking to a group of people 
at the base of the ramp. The stutter of automatic weapons crackled in the air, 
mixing with the low whoomph of a bus's exploding gas tank. As I got closer, I 
could see a column of armored personnel carriers crashing through the flaming 
blockade. "They're firing at children," someone hollered at me as I ran past. 
People were lying next to the hedges that lined the ramp but I couldn't tell 
whether they were dead or alive. A man who had followed me up the ramp, shaking 
in anger, screamed, "Kuomintang fascists!" The gunfire was too intense for me 
to get closer, so I retreated to where my two friends were waiting. A man, 
almost hysterical, said that he had seen 30 people shot -- "old people, young 
people." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you a journalist?" a woman asked, her words clutching at me in despair. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, yes, I am," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you," she exhaled, "thank you." 
</P>
<P>
I could see the alarm and shock on my friends' faces. They said they had been 
told that people who had been killed were brought down the ramp just before we 
got there. We stood for a moment behind a telephone pole, stunned, peering at 
the column of armor roaring over the bridge. It was simply too dangerous to 
stay where we were, so we jogged back to the car. In the years I lived in 
Beijing, it was never more than a gray, placidly boring city where people's 
public emotions were confined to drinking games and cooing over babies. A wave 
of student protests that swept the country in 1986 had petered out when the 
government shook the fist of repression. It was inconceivable that the army 
would actually fight its way into Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
We decided that we had to get to Tian An Men Square before the first assault 
troops. We were scared, but we only talked of that much later. 
</P>
<P>
We wound east through the inner city streets, dense with people. At one 
roadblock, we slowed to weave through barricades lined with thousands of 
people. Suddenly, someone pointed at our "journalist" placard and started 
clapping. Then another, and another. Applause swept us along. V signs were 
waved in front of our car. The people of Beijing wanted us to be there to 
record that night. 
</P>
<P>
"God, I can't believe it," one of the reporters said. "I can't believe it." She 
said it again and again as we drove. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter on a motorcycle drew up alongside and handed me a soldier's hat. 
"Hang on to this for me," he shouted. I stuffed it under the front seat. He 
pulled away. Days later, the cap was discovered under the seat. It was soaked 
with blood. 
</P>
<P>
We parked the car just north of Changan Avenue, next to Zhongnanhai, the old 
imperial compound where the Chinese communist leadership lives and works, a 
couple of blocks west of the square. Hurrying toward Changan, we were ahead of 
the army. The next day, I learned that many people had died at Xidan Road, just 
to the west. 
</P>
<P>
We ran toward the square, rushing along with a tide of retreating people, some 
on foot, others pedaling furiously on their black bicycles. Breathing heavily, 
unsure of escape routes, the other two reporters and I stopped under the 
portrait of Mao affixed to the face of the Forbidden City. We agreed that if we 
were separated, we would meet by one of the stone lions that guard the archway 
to the ancient city. 
</P>
<P>
As I looked east, about 30 or 40 yards away, I could see an armored personnel 
carrier ablaze. I ran over to take some pictures. People were heaving cardboard 
boxes and blankets on the searing metal surface. I could see the fractured 
silhouette of a 50-caliber machine gun pointed crazily into the starless sky. 
</P>
<P>
"They killed too many people," cried a young girl who grabbed my sleeve as I 
scribbled notes. "We hate them. We hate them." It was 1:30 a.m., June 4. 
</P>
<P>
Still the army had not made it to the square. Then, loudspeakers on the massive 
floodlight stanchions edging the square blared to life. "A serious 
counterrevolutionary rebellion is taking place in the capital tonight," a voice 
echoed. "Rioters have furiously attacked soldiers and stolen their weapons and 
ammunition. . . . The counterrevolutionary rebellion must now be resolutely 
counterattacked. . . . Residents should strictly abide by the specific 
regulations as provided by the martial law. . . . Safeguard the constitution 
and defend the security of the socialist motherland. . . . The personal safety 
of anyone who ignores this warning cannot be guaranteed." 
</P>
<P>
I wandered along the northern edge of the square, watching. Buses were on fire, 
their window frames white with flames that billowed from the vehicles' innards. 
Nearby, the Goddess of Democracy flickered with each surge of fire. A bus 
rocketed through the crowd on Changan Avenue, its driver wrestling with the 
huge steering wheel as he pointed it toward the main gate of the Forbidden 
City. The bus sliced through the gate, jackknifing across the inner entrance in 
what seemed to be an effort to block soldiers from charging through. Over the 
heads of the horde of people, blue flashing ambulance lights spun as the white 
vans crept toward the square from the east. A woman with long black hair 
wearing a white satin dress clacked past me on white spiked heels, swinging a 
white patent-leather purse. I watched her for a moment, stopped by the sight of 
her effortless saunter, her studied obliviousness to the building storm. 
</P>
<P>
To the west, I heard the thunder of engines and the churn of tank treads; the 
crowd turned to watch as a wave of closely set pairs of headlights came into 
view. I looked at my watch. It was 1:45. Dozens of tanks, the barrels of their 
cannons almost parallel to the ground, shuddered to a halt almost 100 yards 
from the western edge of the square. I heard sporadic cracks of rifle fire. 
Behind the headlights, through my binoculars, I could make out the shadows of 
troops, thousands of steel helmets glinting faintly in the darkness as the 
soldiers moved behind the tanks, running toward the wall of the Forbidden City. 
I hurried to where my two friends were to meet me. They were not there. 
</P>
<P>
People walked or ran aimlessly through the square, across Changan Avenue, as if 
they did not know where to go. I trotted toward the lights of the tanks. There, 
about 100 yards from the wall of armor that spread across the avenue, not more 
than a hundred people formed a thin line, not linking arms, but standing 
quietly. I ran up behind them. I wanted to see their faces, to look in their 
eyes, to see these people who stood unarmed in front of the Chinese army. The 
people, baby-faced students and weathered workers, gazed toward the army that 
had come for them, some vacantly, some worried, some, it seemed, without fear. 
Suddenly there was a sharp popping sound, then a rattle, like firecrackers 
going off in a neighbor's back yard. Some people in front of me fell to the 
ground, awkwardly, as if broken apart. I dove onto the pavement and began 
crawling backward. I bumped into another American journalist who was also on 
all fours, holding his bicycle upright. The bicycle seemed to tower over us, a 
target for the bullets flying over our heads. I suggested that he abandon the 
bicycle, that perhaps we needn't draw attention to ourselves. "It's not your 
$500 bicycle," he shot back. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd retreated, some running bent over, some crawling. Two young men ran 
by me furiously pushing a bicycle cart. On the flatbed of the cart a man lay, 
bathed in blood. More people ran by, carrying a woman whose shoulder was soaked 
red. There were some screams, but now I cannot remember many. Instead, there 
was a silent anger and a frenzy to move the wounded to the ambulances. A chant 
of "ji shao shu, ji shao shu," -- "very, very few" -- erupted from the mob, 
which regrouped in straggly lines of 40 or 50 to face the troops. Again, a wave 
of people moved to meet the army, and again the rifles cracked. More people 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
I ran farther east, past the edge of the square. Behind me, helmeted troops ran 
around the line of tanks, their engines thundering as they crept forward. 
Another bus sped through the retreating crowd, young men leaning from the 
windows waving bamboo poles fixed with crimson flags, the driver, in a 
snow-white headband, barreling suicidally toward the oncoming tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"Ba gong, ba gong, ba gong," the crowd chanted. "Strike, strike, strike." 
</P>
<P>
People swarmed by me, some moving to the square. Many were weeping. Now the 
sound of gunfire was almost continuous. Threads of yellow light shot from the 
southern edge of the square, machine-gun tracer bullets, I later learned. 
</P>
<P>
I stopped a young man to talk for a moment. "I don't believe it," he said, his 
voice shaking. "How is this possible? How could we prepare?" He stopped 
abruptly as another young man lying face down on a cart, blood seeping through 
his clothing, was pushed past us. The first young man put his hands on his 
face. "You must support the Chinese people," he said, turning to me. "You must 
go to your country and support the Chinese people." 
</P>
<P>
"Si duo le, si duo le" -- "Many are dead, many are dead" -- I heard this again 
and again as the crowd fell back under the crackle of gunfire, retreating 
eastward, down Changan. I was caught between my desire to see what happened on 
the square and the gunfire from the troops to the west. I ran, then walked with 
the throng, too frightened to figure out how to get back to the square. The 
journalist with the bicycle weaved toward me through the crowd. I hopped on the 
back and we rode east, back to the diplomatic compound. 
</P>
<P>
I learned what happened later at Tian An Men by talking with students and the 
few foreign reporters who stayed till dawn. As the avenue on the north side of 
the square emptied of people, a strange quiet enveloped the square. Bicyclists 
circled over the expanse of concrete. In the tents that had been set up earlier 
to treat hunger strikers and ailing students, doctors in stained white coats 
worked furiously. Students filtered out of their tents, away from the edge of 
the square where the growling APCs were assembling. In some tents, they told 
me, despite the gunfire, the roar of tanks, students slept. I could only 
understand it as a response of catatonic, paralyzing fear. 
</P>
<P>
Near 3:30 a.m, Taiwanese rock singer Hou Dejian, who was on a hunger strike at 
the Monument to the People's Heroes, a squat pillar set atop friezes of 
socialist heroism in the middle of the square and for weeks the command center 
for the student leaders, walked over to the row of soldiers at the north end of 
the square. There, I later learned from several eyewitnesses, he managed to 
negotiate time for a retreat for the thousands of students still huddled on the 
steps of the monument and in the tents scattered across the square. 
</P>
<P>
At 4 o'clock, the floodlights on the square were doused and only the headlights 
of APCs and an occasional television light pierced the darkness. A wave of 
soldiers moved from the Great Hall and marched onto the southern half of the 
square, their rifles, bayonets fixed, pointed before them. Twenty minutes 
later, the lights came on again. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the APCs moving," a Western reporter told me days later. "It was 
eerie, the dark outlines of the APCs against the floodlights, the elongated 
shadows stretching into the square." As the APCs churned over the northern edge 
of the square, a column of students started pouring toward the southeast corner 
through a gantlet of student marshals holding hands, forming a tunnel to 
apparent safety. It was 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later, the first soldier was on the monument. Five minutes after 
that, about 100 yards away, the Goddess of Democracy toppled forward, ground 
under the tracks of an APC. 
</P>
<P>
What happened in the next 60 minutes may never be fully known. The next day, 
many students told of APCs rolling over tents filled with students, grinding 
their bodies to a pulp. A senior American diplomat said later that many 
students were crushed to death. There have been dozens of firsthand accounts of 
bodies being burned on the square with flame throwers, of soldiers shoveling 
bodies into piles "like cordwood," one Chinese told me. 
</P>
<P>
There is, too, a tale -- maybe apocryphal -- of students standing to protect 
the Goddess of Democracy. In the days that followed, as I visited university 
campuses, I heard the story over and over: A dozen students had linked arms 
around the statue, facing the armor that would devour them. "They were run 
over," a student said to me, tears streaming down his face. "They were all 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, though, the students who retreated south escaped the square unharmed. 
A Western reporter who walked the last yards with the students said that he saw 
no one shot during the withdrawal, that even the last stragglers made it off 
the square alive. "I was impressed by the calm," he told me, "indeed the 
serenity of the students." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Chinese army fanned throughout Beijing, the rattle of 
machine guns and automatic rifles filling the air. Tanks pushed through the 
streets, bashing through barricades, retaking the city from its own citizens. 
</P>
<P>
AFTERMATH 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning, June 4. It was 4:30 when I made it home. I could barely absorb 
what I had seen, and, somehow, I slept for several hours. The morning sun, 
rising through Beijing's gray-brown haze, brought little solace. The 
continuing, sporadic gunfire reminded me of what had happened the night before, 
and what was still taking place. I talked to a fellow reporter about going back 
out on the streets, something we regarded as dangerous, but something we 
thought we should do. We took bicycles -- the road was impassable to cars -- 
and gingerly headed back toward the square where we could hear gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
Changan Avenue bore the scars of battle. Twisted steel lane dividers pretzeled 
across the road. Flattened garbage cans, gutted buses and pulverized concrete 
barriers lay like the entrails of madness the entire distance to the square. As 
we weaved through the debris, Beijing's residents peered from the mouths of the 
hutongs, staring at the wreckage. There were few bicyclists. One, a tough, 
grizzled youth, pumped up behind us. "It's dangerous," he informed us. "Aren't 
you scared?" I assured him that I was. 
</P>
<P>
I did not see what happened next, just the result. But four people, three 
flight attendants from Air France and a Portuguese reporter for a Hong Kong 
magazine, described the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the morning, about 10:25, a frail line of about 60 protesters, 
unarmed, walked past the Beijing Hotel toward the army, pleading with their 
eyes to stop the slaughter. Rifles chattered. Dozens of people slumped onto the 
pavement. Another line of protesters pushed toward the wall of soldiers, and 
again the rifles crackled. More people fell, blood spreading across their 
chests, some wounded, some dead. In all, more than 50 people were killed or 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"They just stood there and died," the Portuguese reporter said. "The first time 
the troops started shooting, it lasted for 60 seconds. I was looking at my 
watch, counting the seconds." There were, the reporter told me, four lines of 
protesters and four fusillades before the suicidal effort was extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
We rode up to the Beijing Hotel just after the slaughter. There were still 
bodies on the street, some being hefted onto bicycle carts, others just lying 
there. The other reporter and I ran through the upper floors of the hotel, 
straining to find a better vantage point on the square. We tried locked door 
after locked door. One door opened into an office full of Chinese security 
officers with walkie-talkies. We rushed to the balcony, but the security people 
forced us back. Racing back down the hall, we found a stairwell to a fire 
escape that led to the roof. Shoving aside planks that had been piled on the 
exit to block access, we ran to the edge of the roof. Chinese security people 
on another corner of the roof began moving toward us. We stared for a minute, 
perhaps two, toward the square, the scene of the previous night's carnage. 
</P>
<P>
There, on the vast expanse of deathly gray, like a piece of chalk ground 
beneath a heel, was a stain of white, the shards of the Goddess of Democracy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN THE DAYS THAT followed, I tried to learn as much as possible about what had 
happened all over Beijing. I visited a few Chinese friends, but already the 
suffocating blanket of repression was falling on the city. Chinese were being 
told not to talk to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
At one campus, the Institute of Politics and Law, I saw a makeshift wake. In 
the rotunda of the administration building, the battered body of a student, his 
skull crushed, lay on a table surrounded by blocks of ice. Students filed 
slowly past, small swatches of black fabric pinned to their sleeves. No one 
knew the student's name, only that he had died when the army moved into 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Three days after Tian An Men, as authorities began to round up worker and 
student leaders, some of whom were later executed, a radio broadcast from Hong 
Kong brought China, and the world, the voice of Chai Ling, a 23-year-old 
student at Beijing Teachers College and one of the most prominent student 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"I am Chai Ling," the voice said. "I am still alive. Ours was a peaceful 
protest. The ultimate price of a peaceful protest was to sacrifice oneself. Arm 
in arm, shoulder to shoulder, we sang the Internationale and slowly walked 
toward the Monument to the People's Heroes. We sat quietly at the monument 
awaiting with dignity the arrival of our executioners. We realized that what 
was happening was a conflict between love and hate and not a battle of brute 
forces. My compatriots, even at the darkest moment, dawn will still break."

OUTTAKES: RUNNING OUT OF FUEL?

<P>
A just-out book about the making of "Star Trek V" -- by director/co-star 
William Shatner, and his daughter, Lisabeth Shatner -- purports to tell the 
behind-the-scenes account of "the most spectacular 'Star Trek' movie yet!" 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the book -- "Captain's Log: William Shatner's Personal Account of the 
Making of 'Star Trek V' " -- was published by Pocket before the "spectacular" 
film's anticipated box office grosses didn't roll in. 
</P>
<P>
In 4 1/2 weeks, "Star Trek V" -- generally panned by the critics -- has to date 
grossed less than the previous films -- just $45.7 million and is sputtering 
badly. Compare previous screen Treks: "I" totaled $82.2 million; "II," $78.7 
million; "III," $76.4 million; and "IV," $109.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Harve Bennett argued, "You can't make those comparisons -- not 
considering that this is the summer of the great (blockbuster) blitz. Relative 
to the box office of 'II' and 'III,' we are off just 18%. Being off 18% this 
summer is not exactly chopped liver." 
</P>
<P>
As for the critical knocks singling out Shatner's direction: "Listen, I don't 
think there's one critic in the world who knows what the (heck) a director 
does." Bennett applauded Shatner for "creating a working environment of fun and 
energy -- we had a good time." 
</P>
<P>
(As for the possibility of another sequel: "In the words of Spock, 'There are 
always possibilities.' ") 
</P>
<P>
According to reps for Shatner, "He is being inundated with scripts to direct." 
</P>
<P>
They declined to specify the inundations. Pat H. Broeske

<TEXT>
<P>
Is parodist Weird Al Yankovic in hot water with the Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts &amp; Sciences, which routinely takes action to prevent unauthorized use 
of Oscar's image? 
</P>
<P>
In his offbeat comedy, "UHF," due out Friday from Orion Pictures, Weird Al does 
an Indiana Jones "Raiders" send-up in one sequence -- scheming to steal a prop 
Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Academy exec administrator Bruce Davis said the organization would wait until 
the film's release before considering legal action.

Author-writer-director William Peter Blatty, currently completing Morgan 
Creek's "Exorcist: 1990," insists that his sequel will be "the last serious 
word on the subject." Meanwhile, his next project, "Demons 5, Exorcists 0," 
will send up the subject that made him a household name. 
</P>
<P>
"The script's completed, and Fox (which released '1990') has first refusal," 
said Blatty. "It's about a convention of priests beset by an evil presence." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's producer Steve Wizan's tentatively titled "Repossessed," a spoof 
written and directed by Robert Logan. It's about a woman -- played by 
"Exorcist" star Linda Blair, no less -- once possessed by a demon, who now 
seeks help when she feels that ole black magic returning. Leslie Nielsen is an 
off-kilter priest, Ned Beatty an evil evangelist and Morton Downey Jr. cameoed 
as a disbeliever. 
</P>
<P>
Wizan claims, "It's not an 'Exorcist' spoof. We're sending up all horror 
pictures. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Blatty said he's aware of Wizan's project: "I hope it's fun. And I'm sure it's 
not at all like the film I'm preparing." Leonard Klady

I applaud Gillespie for trying to fight the lawyers, educate the legislators, 
tolerate the crusading, immature professional "consumerists" and reform the 
insurance companies. Anyone who has had a claim against an insurance company 
knows insurance reforms are needed, but the insurance companies should not be 
destroyed in the process. Despite the article's constant references to the 
clothes Gillespie wears, her dresses and shoes are unimportant -- it is her 
ideas that really matter.

ON THE RECORD: A BLENDING OF STYLES IN CELEBRITY CHAMBER GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Celebrity chamber music, the superstars getting together to form a supernova, 
proving that they can submerge their egos in the interests of intimate 
ensemble, is more often a lark for the performers than a service to the 
composer. But the exceptions can offer memorable rewards. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Grammophon in notes for its new recording of the complete Beethoven 
string trios (427 687, 2 CDs) offers no information on the performance history 
of the ensemble composed of violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, violist Bruno 
Giuranna and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. The results, however, indicate that 
they did not meet in a studio, shake hands and sit down to sight-read some fun 
stuff. These performances not only crackle with virtuoso intensity: they are of 
a piece, and they are Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
Not a trace of flippancy here. Even in the hyper-extended Opus 3, rhythms are 
precise, phrases fully formed. And in the three trios of Opus 9, Beethoven's 
splendid warm-ups for the Opus 18 quartets, Mutter/Giuranna/Rostropovich, 
whether assuming a single voice or as three individuals, give us the full quota 
of fiery drive, conversational elegance, Olympian serenity -- whatever the 
music calls for. The darkly rapturous slow movement of the Trio in D, Opus 9, 
No. 2, says it all. A splendid achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrities of the recent past, violinist Henryk Szeryng, cellist Pierre 
Fournier and pianist Wilhelm Kempff assembled in 1970 for the first and only 
time to contribute the six big Beethoven piano trios to Deutsche Grammophon's 
massive, limited-circulation Beethoven bicentennial release. The trio 
recordings return now as a readily obtainable, mid-priced DG set (415 879, 3 
CDs). 
</P>
<P>
The results are curious, with Szeryng, normally the aggressive player, 
deferring to the senior member, Kempff -- the dozing man's pianist -- in 
matters of tempo (slow, when his is 
</P>
<P>
the opening gambit, slowed-down when he is preceded by Szeryng) and dynamics 
(narrowly soft). 
</P>
<P>
Kempff dominates not through physical strength but strength of will, imposing 
his underemphasis, his miniaturization, presumably in the interests of Good 
Taste and Classicism, in which intensity and music-flexing were at one time 
verboten. 
</P>
<P>
Add to Szeryng's frustration and Kempff's browsing Fournier's earnest, 
gray-toned cello and you wind up with, well, very little. 
</P>
<P>
Another mid-priced reissue (EMI/Angel Studio 63124, 3 CDs) offers the piano 
trios with opus number as well as some snippets without recorded in 1970 by the 
young, powerhouse assemblage of violinist Pinchas Zukerman, cellist Jacqueline 
du Pre and pianist Daniel Barenboim. Their playing here, whether or not always 
in accord with the chamber music ideal of thinking with a single mind, was -- 
and is -- so imbued with vitality and affection, to say nothing of sheer 
mechanical skill, that academic critical standards become irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
While the perfection of an interpretive concept may be the end-all of chamber 
music, if what emerges after years of ensemble gestation is playing of solid 
proficiency, one would much rather have the stars in less than perfect 
alignment. 
</P>
<P>
These thoughts are inspired by Germany's dozen-year old Abegg Trio -- violinist 
Ulrich Beetz, cellist Birgit Erichson, pianist Gerrit Zitterbart -- offering 
every last scrap Beethoven wrote for their combination of instruments on four 
individual Intercord CDs (860.860 through 860.863). 
</P>
<P>
But the humor of, say, the flashing finales of Opus 1, No. 2 or Opus 70, No. 2 
elude these people; the heavenly arches of the 'Archduke' are flattened out in 
their rhythmically square reading, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Much is made in Intercord's program notes about the performers' adherence to 
the fast tempos indicated by Beethoven's original markings (as recalled by 
Czerny). 
</P>
<P>
OK, but Abegg speed plus Abegg stolidity do not add up to liveliness. It might 
be noted in this connection that the more or less ad hoc 
Perlman-Harrell-Ashkenazy trio, in EMI/Angel's 1987 set, play nearly everything 
faster, and far more imaginatively, than the Abegg without citing (or, perhaps, 
even being aware of) historical precedent.

DANCEWATCHING: DANCERS CHEER KALEIDOSCOPE'S RETURN; 
</P>
<P>
CAL STATE L.A. PROVIDES A HAVEN FOR THE FESTIVAL 
</P>

"Good catch!" yelled choreographer Ferne Ackerman above the music as one of her 
dancers deftly slipped into a long cloak's sleeves after tossing it skyward in 
the darkened Playhouse at Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"Great," she cried out as another slid sensuously across the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Rehearsing a work called "Flame," six members of Ackerman's Big Flood Dance 
Company were draped in flowing robes, black on the outside and colored on the 
inside, that Ackerman said symbolize people's appearances "on the surface and 
below the surface." 
</P>
<P>
Effective movement isn't all that Ackerman has been cheering about lately. She, 
along with many others, is applauding the return of Dance Kaleidoscope, the 
annual summer festival that ceased after eight years in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Big Flood is among 24 troupes and solo artists scheduled for the two weekend 
event, Friday through July 23 and July 28-30 at Cal State L.A. Three mixed-bill 
programs, each repeated once, will feature performance art as well as dance. 
</P>
<P>
This year's festival roster, which includes three world premieres, "looks 
great," said choreographer Karen Goodman, a former Kaleidoscope participant. It 
represents "some of the better performers, in terms of what's going on in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
The now-defunct Los Angeles Area Dance Alliance first presented the showcase 
for local, mostly up-and-coming dance artists in 1979. It was discontinued 
three years ago, a few months after the alliance fell victim to financial and 
administrative troubles, but not before giving exposure to more than 150 
troupes and soloists at the John Anson Ford Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
With partial funding this year from the City of Los Angeles, Cal State L.A. has 
agreed to fully sponsor the festival. Once again, low-budget troupes and 
struggling soloists will be provided with a rent-free venue and other 
production resources such as stage lighting and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The notion to revive Kaleidoscope at the university was initiated by Donald 
Hewitt, a former Kaleidoscope organizer who teaches ballet at the campus, five 
miles from the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt got the idea after observing Cal State L.A.'s growing commitment to 
dance. In addition to hosting the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, 
the university is evolving into a home for the Joffrey Ballet, which will spend 
a seven-week rehearsal residency there beginning in August. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew (the university) was building its visibility in the arts," said Hewitt, 
director of Dance Kaleidoscope 1989. "I thought this would be in line with 
that, and yet add the local, grass-roots angle." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hewitt brought his idea to Clif Harper, chairman of the university's 
theater arts and dance department, who willingly passed it on to Cal State L.A. 
President James M. Rosser. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to provide new artists with exposure and provide a forum in which 
L.A.'s contributions to the arts can be expressed," Rosser said, noting that 
the university's stated mission is to be "a focal point of the arts." 
</P>
<P>
"We think Kaleidoscope is something that deserves to be kept alive." 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the $40,000 festival came mostly in the form of free facilities and 
services, such as audio equipment provided by the university, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Solicitation for corporate donations proved unsuccessful so far, but dancers' 
customary honorariums totaling $7,000 will be paid by the Los Angeles Cultural 
Affairs Department, a city official said. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, efforts were made to avert controversies and pitfalls that 
dogged previous festivals, Hewitt said. One especially divisive issue involved 
a policy allowing organizers to invite some groups while others were required 
to audition. 
</P>
<P>
"There was selectivism," charged a disgruntled choreographer in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, everyone who wanted to dance in Kaleidoscope redux had to audition. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to start off again fresh," free of "negativity and mistrust," said 
Lula Washington, director of Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theatre and one of 
a 10-member panel that chose this year's participants. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said pains were also taken to avoid criticism that festival evenings 
was interminably long, squashing too many acts into each program. 
</P>
<P>
After about 100 artists and groups auditioned in February, "we took 24, instead 
of about 40 or more groups," Hewitt said. "We wished to upgrade the quality, 
</P>
<P>
and we did," he added. "A lot of new, emerging people applied. We really tried 
to reach out and get a wide selection of different kinds of dance." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran choreographer Lola Montes and prominent dancers, arts administrators 
and others served on Kaleidoscope's selection committee: 
</P>
<P>
Sasha Anawalt, free-lance dance writer; Donald Bradburn, professor of dance at 
UC Irvine; Barry Glass, director of the Aman Folk Ensemble; Warren Lucas, 
dancer and choreographer; Gail Matsui, project director, Japan America Theatre; 
Tim Miller, performance artist and co-founder of Highways performance space; 
Montes, director of Lola Montes and her Spanish Dancers; Judy Scalin, director 
of the dance department at Loyola Marymount University; Lula Washington, 
identified above; Lee Werbel, grants manager for the National/State/County 
Partnership.

INSIDE CAA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Inside the Agency," Michael Cieply's July 2 article about CAA, the 
Hollywood talent agency: 
</P>
<P>
The guys at Creative Artists do nothing all day but stroke people they like and 
"kill" people they don't like. They wield a ridiculous amount of power over the 
minds of an entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
Their power is derived not from ability or excellence or even intelligence. It 
comes simply from forming a coterie -- it's all "who you know." 
</P>
<P>
You can see why this sort of thing has such a negative effect on the Hollywood 
"product." In the case of CAA, they usually sacrifice artistic integrity for 
increased company profits. When they "package" a deal, putting the script, the 
actors and the director together, more often than not all of these "elements" 
are in-house. 
</P>
<P>
The game is money and power. The American public gets lousy programming as a 
result.

TEARS DIDN'T HURT MERMAN'S APPETITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martin Gottfried's lovely 30th anniversary tribute to "Gypsy," (July 2) struck 
a particularly nostalgic chord in me. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the New York production, I was working for columnist Earl 
Wilson, whose office was upstairs from the Broadway Theater. Every Wednesday at 
3, the air would be split by that wonderful brassy fanfare of the overture. 
</P>
<P>
While interviewing and becoming friends with cast members, I had the pleasure 
of watching the show backstage. My favorite memory is of Ethel Merman coming 
offstage at the end, wiping away the tears from "Rose's Turn" as she cheerily 
belted: "OK, where you guys wanna go for dinner between shows?"

WHO'S EXPLOITED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tro Konialian's July 2 letter bemoans the commercial excess of today's artistic 
productions, specifically Andrew Lloyd Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera." One 
passage of his letter:" . . . If I were the world-renowned composer . . . I 
would require stipulations in the production and advertising contracts to 
protect my art from being exploited and tainted by modern business tactics and 
commercialism." 
</P>
<P>
I admire Mr. Konialian's vision of Lloyd Webber, Zola-like, penning his latest 
opus with stiffened fingers in a freezing loft somewhere, but Konialian should 
suggest those stipulations to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking about the "exploited" artist who had the idea of incorporating 
and selling shares in himself and who makes more money in one hour than most 
people make in a year and who personally approves of each item of tainting 
exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
The driving force behind the commercialism of Mr. Lloyd Webber's art is Mr. 
Lloyd Webber. 
</P>
<P>
It is likely that much of his creative artistry will be remembered for the next 
few years, and it is a virtual certainty that his business innovations will 
live forever. So don't cry for Lloyd Webber, Mr. Konialian.

THOSE OLD ROCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Never Too Old to Rock" by Robert Hilburn, June 25, and the letters 
that followed on July 9: 
</P>
<P>
I think the media makes too big an issue over whether musicians such as the Who 
are "too old to rock," and spends an inordinate amount of time mulling over the 
merits of new music vs. old music, pop music vs. rock music, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Music is music! It's meant to be enjoyed, not analyzed, scrutinized and 
categorized to death. 
</P>
<P>
And if it's truly good music, it doesn't matter if the artists are 21 or 91.

I disagree with Jonathan Gold's findings in "The Search for the Perfect Fried

Kizzy's Back Porch in the Marina. It is fried in peanut oil and it is 
absolutely delicious.

INSIDE CAA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found Cieply's article interesting and informative. However, CAA co-founder 
Mike Ovitz's impassioned and often smarmy plea (in the accompanying article, 
"Straight Talk") for "everyone (in the business) to root for each other" almost 
made me lose my lunch. 
</P>
<P>
If I ever had any doubts about Hollywood agents getting an unjust reputation 
for being sharks, Ovtiz's statement helped me make up my mind. 
</P>
<P>
What a pitch -- I'm surprised he wasn't holding a puppy in his photo.

NEW VIDEOS: OUTDOOR FURNITURE (THE STANLEY WORKS; 1989) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

THE DISTINGUISHING characteristic of outdoor furniture may be rough-and-ready 
simplicity, but its construction tends not to be. Because the furniture 
(chairs, benches, tables and planters) has to be sturdy to survive active use 
and must be joined and finished to endure the elements, it should be built with 
particular care. That means selecting the right wood, cutting the varied and 
many pieces precisely, using the proper hardware correctly, and painting and 
staining carefully. To do this you also need the correct tools, including a 
chisel, bore bits, block plane, wood file, miter box, a hammer, a crosscut and 
coping saws, drill and screwdrivers, among other items. Building outdoor 
furniture, like building furniture, is a challenge, and one needs precise 
directions if hours of frustration and failure are to be avoided. The 
"Build-It-Yourself" brochure and video offer just that -- easy-to-follow, 
step-by-step directions, well organized and adequately illustrated. It should 
help the do-it-yourself handy-person. Available at select hardware counters or 
order from The Stanley Works, P.O. Box 1800, Department PR89, New Britain, 
Conn. 06050. ($14.95) Sam Hall Kaplan

HAIR-CARE CHAINS FIND COMPETITION IS RAZOR SHARP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supercuts and Fantastic Sam's emerged in the mid-1970s by offering 
no-appointment-needed, moderately priced haircuts. They were an instant success 
with both men and women, filling the void left by the disappearing neighborhood 
barber and beauty shop. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, as competition has intensified for a share of the $24 billion 
Americans spend annually on their hair, the franchised haircut chains have 
turned to increasingly aggressive marketing and new services to attract 
customers and boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
They are redesigning their salons -- abandoning bright colors in favor of 
subtle grays and mauves. Both companies also have begun to offer hair styling 
and conditioning (in addition to the standard haircut), and are selling shampoo 
and conditioning products. 
</P>
<P>
Supercuts even went a step further by hiring Dan Garvey, a nationally 
recognized stylist, to serve as the company's education director. 
</P>
<P>
Most visibly, both companies have hit the airwaves with provocative television 
commercials. The Supercuts commercials feature clips of outrageous hair styles 
and lively music, while spots for Fantastic Sam's suggest that a permanent wave 
may be the perfect cure for a woman's romantic woes. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the changes, especially the new salon decor, seem to have been 
embraced by consumers, two recent marketing gimmicks backfired: 
</P>
<P>
* Earlier this year, Fantastic Sam's made a deal with General Mills to place a 
coupon for a free children's haircut on 20 million boxes of Cheerios. When 
children by the bus and carload appeared at salons, many franchisees rebelled, 
refusing to honor the coupons and imposing restrictions on redemption. Many 
complained vehemently to General Mills and Fantastic Sam's that they lost 
thousands of dollars by redeeming the coupons. They also argued that they had 
not been properly informed about the promotion before the boxes hit store 
shelves in April. 
</P>
<P>
* In a less dramatic marketing flop, Supercuts tried to sell discount coupon 
books as Christmas "stocking stuffers" to encourage return visits. When most 
customers said no thanks, Supercuts tried to give them away. Even then, 
franchise owners said few coupons were ever redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
Beauty industry observers are watching the franchised haircut war with 
interest. The amount spent on hair care has been increasing for several 
reasons, according to American Salon's "Green Book," an annual report 
considered the bible of the beauty industry. 
</P>
<P>
As they approach middle age, Baby Boomers are spending more on their 
appearance. The Green Book says people of all ages are spending more on beauty 
services because beauty has been redefined to represent good health. And men, 
who formerly shunned beauty salons, are spending more each year on everything 
from permanents to manicures. In fact, men make up about 65% of Supercuts' 
customers, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
One big reason that the number of franchised beauty salons has increased is 
that virtually anyone can start one and be successful. The financial 
requirements are relatively modest -- usually $5,000 to $25,000 for the 
franchise rights and less than $100,000 for the building and equipment. In 
exchange for fees and royalties, franchisees receive national and regional 
advertising support, training, advice and other support services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hurting Independents 
</P>
<P>
According to the Green Book, there are 8,000 chain-owned salons in the United 
States. New York-based Glemby International leads the list, with 1,515 
company-owned salons located primarily in upscale department stores. Regis 
Corp. of Minnesota operates about 1,400 company salons in malls and department 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
On the franchise side, Supercuts has 550 salons and Fantastic Sam's about 
1,325, including those in Canada, Japan and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Hair Performers, based in Illinois, has 300 franchised salons. 
Massachusetts-based Command Performance has about 270 salons. These firms and 
about a dozen smaller companies are in the midst of expanding, according to the 
quarterly Franchise Handbook. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Mugnai vice president and publisher of American Salon, the official 
publication of the 48,000-member National Cosmetology Assn., said he expects to 
see more franchising in future years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the franchises are hurting the independents, but not driving them out 
of business," Mugnai said. 
</P>
<P>
He said independent salon owners are responding to pressure from franchised 
salons by expanding the number of services that they offer, hiring better 
stylists and capitalizing on their individual talents and flair to attract 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
While many independents may feel threatened by franchises, one Southland barber 
-- whose shop is next to a Supercuts in a Pasadena shopping center -- said he 
benefits from the millions of dollars that the chain spends on advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"They bring a lot of people to the area," said Rod Otto. But Otto sees the 
traditional one-chair barbershop ultimately going the way of the American 
buffalo. "It will eventually be extinct." 
</P>
<P>
John Lewis, president of Fantastic Sam's, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a great increase in the number of franchised units and a slowing in 
independent businesses," he said. "People want to go into business for 
themselves, but they don't want to reinvent the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
While declining to offer sales figures, Lewis said Fantastic Sam's, founded by 
barber Sam Ross in 1974, is capitalizing on the need for a moderately priced 
haircut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strict Rules 
</P>
<P>
"We are a Chevrolet," said Lewis. "We are absolutely a middle market company 
offering an excellent quality haircut and other services at a reasonable price 
in a wholesome environment." 
</P>
<P>
Fantastic Sam's does not set the price of services offered by its salons, but 
in the Los Angeles area, a haircut and shampoo are available for about $10. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, it has been a very good business for me," said Silvia Anorga, who 
with her husband, Edward, owns Fantastic Sam's outlets in Pico Rivera, 
Montebello and East Los Angeles. "I do wish the company would do more," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Anorga, who also owns three beauty supply stores, said she chafes under the 
company's strict rules about which products franchisees may use. "We need more 
flexibility because there are only three (brands) we can work with," Anorga 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Lieberman, who opened her 11th Fantastic Sam's salon in St. Louis this 
week, said she is generally pleased with the support from the company. However, 
Lieberman, who said she has lost thousands of dollars by redeeming the Cheerios 
box coupons, said she is still hoping that the promotion will generate repeat 
business. Gary Grace, who owns 20 Supercuts salons in Hawaii and California and 
is considered the company's most successful franchisee, says stylists enjoy 
working for Supercuts because they don't have to draw their customers, as they 
would in an independent salon. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people from small salons say the person who sat in their chair the most 
was themselves," said Grace, a former franchise consultant. 
</P>
<P>
San Rafael-based Supercuts and Memphis, Tenn.-based Fantastic Sam's take 
totally different approaches in collecting fees from their franchisees. 
Fantastic Sam's charges franchisees a flat fee of about $200 a week, while 
Supercuts' franchise holders pay a 15% royalty on sales. Supercuts says it can 
justify the high royalty because its 550 stores generate twice the sales volume 
of other franchised operations, with about 1.5 million haircuts a month. 
Supercuts charges $8 for a haircut, although about 20% of the salons are 
experimenting with a $9 price, according to Betsy Burton, chairman, chief 
executive and president of Supercuts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Benefits Offered 
</P>
<P>
"We are the volume leader in this business," said Burton, who helped arrange a 
purchase of Supercuts from its founders in 1987 by a group of investors, 
including herself. "We offer (franchisees) the largest return on investment in 
the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Burton would not disclose the level of that return on investment, but said 
nationwide sales volume is expected to increase to $150 million in 1989 from 
$140 million in 1988. "We intend to double in size in the next five years," 
Burton said. "I think you'll begin to see some consolidation in the industry -- 
the big will get bigger." 
</P>
<P>
Burton said one of the most serious problems for the franchises is the dearth 
of new stylists. She said government grants that enabled many cosmetology 
students to go to school have dried up in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
To attract employees, Supercuts, which pays about $5 an hour to beginning 
stylists, offers a variety of benefits, including paid vacations, health 
insurance and educational seminars. 
</P>
<P>
The company also has encouraged franchisees to abandon the old orange and royal 
blue colors and change to a new sophisticated gray and mauve theme. 
</P>
<P>
"Supercuts was on its way out because it was outdated," said Peggy Newkirk, who 
manages several stores for Gary Grace. Years ago, "we had so many customers it 
didn't matter if we kept the old ones," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, as more salons began competing for the moderate-price 
haircut business, Supercuts fell behind. Now, Newkirk said, her stylists have 
been given new tools and much more freedom to create the best look for a 
client. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekday morning, eight men were in her salon. Four were in the 
chairs and four more were waiting on a comfortable grape-colored couch. 
</P>
<P>
"I come here because it's the quickest and most convenient," said Mark Empey, a 
26-year-old student at Art Center School of Design. "I've been disappointed 
(with the haircut) a couple of times, but it's not permanent damage -- hair 
grows out."

DISCRIMINATION REMAINS A PROBLEM AT SOME JOB AGENCIES, BUT IT'S HIDDEN AND HARD 
TO FIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHACHTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Audrey Quintero, a Berkeley woman just starting a week of training for her new 
job as a counselor at a temporary help agency, couldn't believe what she was 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The point of this business is to make money, Quintero recalled the trainer 
explaining, no matter what the laws say about discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
So if a company calls and says it wants to hire only men, just fill out the 
"male" section of the job order form under the heading "Appropriate Dress," the 
trainer told Quintero. If the company wants only women, fill out the "female" 
section. Don't worry; the authorities won't be able to figure out the code. 
</P>
<P>
When an employer says he will hire only "the highest-qualified candidate," the 
trainer told Quintero, that means that she should send only whites. And if they 
tell her that they don't want gays or Latinos or blacks? "We simply comply." 
</P>
<P>
Quintero -- who recounts the story in a lawsuit she filed against the 
employment agency, Temporaries Inc. -- may have stumbled upon the dirtiest 
little secret of the personnel industry. 
</P>
<P>
Government experts, lawyers and employment agency workers say a small but 
persistent share of the nation's 20,000-odd permanent and temporary placement 
services continue to engage in systematic, surreptitious discrimination against 
women, minorities and older workers. 
</P>
<P>
Although lawyers for Temporaries Inc. have dismissed Quintero's charges as "a 
figment of this woman's imagination," hers is only one of several recent cases 
to contend that plantation-era attitudes endure in the fast-growing personnel 
placement business: 
</P>
<P>
* A division of Kelly Services, the temporary industry's second-biggest 
company, entered into a consent decree in March with the federal Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission to settle charges that for at least five 
years its Phoenix office had made job assignments on the basis of its workers' 
race. 
</P>
<P>
When customers asked Kelly Assisted Living Services -- which supplies nurses 
and health aides to shut-ins -- not to send blacks, Latinos or American 
Indians, the firm met their demands, former company supervisors told the EEOC. 
Managers reminded the staff every couple of months not to place blacks on jobs 
in Sun City, a 99%-white retirement community. The rationale, Kelly officials 
told the commission, was to save minorities the embarrassment of being rejected 
by clients. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly did not admit any wrongdoing in agreeing to pay up to $5,000 in back 
earnings to employees who lost assignments, to train workers in its anti-bias 
policies and to allow the EEOC broad access to its records for a three-year 
monitoring period. 
</P>
<P>
* Early in June, the commission filed a lawsuit charging that another Kelly 
division in Phoenix had discriminated against a Latino woman by withdrawing her 
from a job assignment because her temporary employer at an apartment complex 
didn't like her accent. 
</P>
<P>
Together, state and federal authorities received 348 complaints of 
discrimination by employment agencies of all kinds last year. Kelly, with 
564,000 employees, was the subject of 45 bias charges -- about 13% of the 
total, close to its share of the temporary help market. 
</P>
<P>
* Interplace/Transworld Recruit, a Los Angeles-based subsidiary of Japan's 
scandal-plagued Recruit Co., is under investigation by the EEOC, which charged 
late in May that the firm used a secret code in its internal records to keep 
track both of job applicants' ages, race and sex and of employers' hiring 
preferences. 
</P>
<P>
If an employer wanted to hire whites between ages 20 and 35 only, for instance, 
an Interplace memo instructed agency workers to write, "Talk to Mary; Suite 
20-35," on the job order. "Do Not Talk to Maryanne" meant that the employer 
refused to hire blacks, according to the memo, one of several company documents 
that the commission made public in court filings. 
</P>
<P>
* Employees of another Recruit subsidiary in Los Angeles, Recruit U.S.A., made 
plans for a hiring campaign for IBM Japan in which non-Asians would be denied 
consideration, according to another memo filed in court by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Recruit lawyers say there is no evidence that the companies discriminated 
against job seekers, and they have charged in court that the EEOC violated 
criminal law by publicizing its investigation. Officials of IBM Japan have said 
Recruit misunderstood their wishes and that they have no indication that the 
commission suspects IBM of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Industry leaders acknowledge that, 20 or 30 years ago, discrimination was as 
widespread in the personnel placement business as it was everywhere else in the 
hiring world. But they are insistent that such acts today are the isolated, 
outlaw practices of a handful of placement workers willing to violate clear 
company policies to boost their earnings or satisfy customer demands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pander to Requests 
</P>
<P>
"To do this on a regular or one-time basis is suicidal," said Samuel R. Sacco, 
executive vice president of the National Assn. of Temporary Services, 
headquartered in Alexandria, Va. "Even if we wanted to do it, we can't afford 
to discriminate, because we don't have enough people in this country to fill 
the job orders we've got." 
</P>
<P>
But civil rights authorities say it is clear that some placement firms -- 
whatever their official policies -- are perpetuating job bias by pandering to 
their clients' discriminatory requests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to have a policy, but the bottom line is they're out there to make 
money, and unfortunately it's the clients' wishes that reign supreme," said 
Sandra J. Padegimas, a trial attorney in Phoenix for the EEOC. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Eaton, a regional manager in Downey for United Temporary Services, had her 
ethics put to the test early this year. 
</P>
<P>
A client needed a receptionist. The qualifications? "Blond, blue-eyed, thin and 
unmarried," the personnel clerk told Eaton, president of the Los Angeles County 
chapter of the California Assn. of Temporary Services. "I said, 'Do you realize 
you just violated every labor code there is?' " 
</P>
<P>
Abiding by the policy favored by her trade association, Eaton said she refused 
to fill the discriminatory job order. Instead, she offered to send the best 
qualified candidates to the job, whatever their color, looks or background -- 
and thereby lost a customer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult as business people to walk away from business," Eaton said. 
"However, we have to make decisions about what kind of business we want to have 
and how we conduct that business." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest employment firms -- Kelly and Manpower -- train their employees to 
walk away from clients who list illegal racial, sexual or age-related 
characteristics when they place an order for permanent or temporary workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Strict Policy 
</P>
<P>
"If you were to ask me to swear on a stack of Bibles I know for sure no field 
office is doing that, I couldn't do it," said Mitchell S. Fromstein, chief 
executive of Milwaukee-based Manpower and its British parent, Blue Arrow PLC, 
the world's largest employment services company. "But I would be shocked and 
disappointed if I learned anybody was." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly's policy, likewise, leaves little room for doubt: "We will not accept any 
order or be involved in any situation that requires or implies discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Donna J. Rheaves says that when she tried to follow that policy, she was 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
Rheaves had enjoyed working for Kelly in the Washington suburbs, so when she 
moved to Phoenix, she took a job in 1984 at Kelly Assisted Living (known at the 
time as Kelly Health Care), with responsibility for hiring and firing home and 
institutional health workers. 
</P>
<P>
This was not the Kelly that Rheaves had known before. When county agencies 
called for temporary workers, the Phoenix office sent blacks, reasoning that 
most of the county's clients were black, Rheaves said. If retirees in Sun City 
said they would not accept minorities as home aides, Kelly wrote the racial 
preference on the job order and sent only whites. 
</P>
<P>
Rheaves, who is black, refused to go along. "I'm of the thinking that I didn't 
want to be sued," she explained. "If a company or a private individual said, 'I 
don't want a black person, will you send me a white person?' I said, 'We are an 
equal opportunity employer.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although Reaves helped boost the office's revenue and had been promoted just a 
month before, Kelly fired her without warning in January, 1985, for what EEOC 
investigators later concluded were trumped-up reasons. Kelly paid Rheaves 
$28,000 to settle her discrimination charge and later signed the consent decree 
ending the broader investigation that she had inspired. 
</P>
<P>
But Rheaves has yet to rebound from the experience. With her 8-year-old son, 
she has been on and off welfare, sometimes sleeping in a car, while she has 
struggled to get a permanent job. When companies learn that she once filed a 
discrimination case against an employer, Rheaves explained, they grow wary. 
</P>
<P>
"People look at you as a troublemaker," said Rheaves, who now lives near 
Atlanta. "I sometimes do regret what I did. It's hurt my son. We've had to live 
a whole different life style. And it seems like I can't get back to where we 
were." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Catch 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights agencies laid down the law against discrimination by employment 
services in the early 1970s. A series of EEOC decisions struck down such hoary 
industry practices as reserving higher-paid jobs for whites and assigning 
blacks only to domestic work, or policies against referring women for 
management jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Catching agencies in the act of discrimination has grown harder since then. Job 
seekers often are unaware that they have been the victims of bias -- they may 
get a placement, just not the best one -- so government officials are dependent 
on workers within employment firms. 
</P>
<P>
"And when they leave, they don't want to say anything, because they'll be 
blackballed," said Carol Schiller, regional administrator in Los Angeles for 
the California Fair Employment and Housing Commission. Hamstrung by a lack of 
funds, Schiller has dropped plans to conduct a hearing on employment agencies' 
conduct. But she has been invited to lecture the local temporary help 
association in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Japanese companies -- unaccustomed to operating in a multicultural land 
-- have become a focus in the United States of complaints about employment 
discrimination. The personnel placement industry is no exception to the trend. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ongoing investigation of Recruit, former employees contend 
that Persona, another large Japanese employment services firm with U.S. 
headquarters in Los Angeles, has systematically discriminated against 
minorities and women in job placements. Several of the ex-employees have 
themselves filed bias charges against the company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used Coded References 
</P>
<P>
When Persona established U.S. operations four years ago, ex-employees say, 
separate files were kept for job applications from older women and blacks to 
avoid placing such workers in Japanese-owned companies that preferred not to 
hire them. Or a black dot would be used to signify a black's application. 
</P>
<P>
The former employees say a gummed note describing the job seeker's appearance 
was attached to most applications, designed for easy disposal if some 
government investigator came snooping. Later, they said, coded references to 
applicants' race, age and sex were placed in personnel records. 
</P>
<P>
Persona President Muneaki Ueda -- seated in his downtown Los Angeles office 
beneath a photo showing him arm in arm with Florence Griffith Joyner, the black 
track star who is Persona's celebrity spokesperson in Japan -- denied that the 
company has ever set out to discriminate. 
</P>
<P>
Some employees may have made furtive notes about job seekers' characteristics, 
he conceded, but if so, they were violating company policies. Yet Ueda 
acknowledged that until recently, workers received little training in those 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
"The corporate policy was clear in my mind, and I thought that all the managers 
were clear," said Ueda, who also had difficulty, during an interview, recalling 
one of his chief critics, a man who was his top assistant from 1985 to 1987. 
"But I cannot be 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Ueda said he wants Persona to be a leader among Japanese companies in 
understanding American business norms. 
</P>
<P>
How? He's conducting seminars for other Japanese businesses on how to abide by 
anti-discrimination laws.

JAMES FLANIGAN: ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES BECOME BIG BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The environment is hot. Environmental issues are center stage this weekend at 
the Paris summit of the world's largest industrial nations. And the environment 
is a focus of increasing concern among Americans worried about asbestos in 
their walls and ceilings, contaminants in their soil and Lord-knows-what in 
their air and water. 
</P>
<P>
On a less foreboding level, the environment is hot in financial markets. 
Fidelity Investments is launching a mutual fund devoted to environmental 
companies. Investment banking firms are vying to raise financing for new and 
promising companies in air and water cleanup and hazardous waste disposal. 
</P>
<P>
There is even an environmental venture fund, run by First Analysis Corp., a 
Chicago research firm. Traditional venture capital backers of semiconductors 
and software, such as Pittsburgh's Hillman Foundation, are now putting money 
behind environmental firms. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of industry is it? Fragmented and relatively unknown, in one sense. 
Analyst Kay Hahn of Chicago Corp., an investment banking firm, calculates that 
the combined annual revenues of 60 publicly traded environmental companies 
totals only $10.5 billion, including the $3.6 billion in revenue of Waste 
Management Inc., the industry's largest company, and the $2 billion revenue of 
Browning Ferris Industries, the No. 2 firm. 
</P>
<P>
But in another sense, the environment -- $30 billion in public and private 
expenditure annually, more than that if you count catalytic converters on 
automobiles -- is on the verge of becoming a major industry of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a young man or woman thinking about a career, that means that an 
environmental or chemical engineering degree could give you a good start. If 
you're an investor, it means that the field might reward a close look. If 
you're in business for yourself, it means that you already know how important 
the environment has become -- or you'll soon find out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Cleanup Bills 
</P>
<P>
Two decades of laws -- from the 1970 Clean Air Act through Superfund and other 
laws on toxic wastes -- have created the regulations. And U.S. industry is 
spending increasing amounts to meet them. According to a list drawn up by First 
Analysis, industry and local governments will spend $17 billion in 1990 to 
clean up current and past wastes and dump sites -- up from $6 billion this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The bill for removing asbestos will rise to $3 billion from $1 billion. Garbage 
collection and disposal will go to $24 billion from $18 billion; sewage system 
improvements to $7 billion from $5 billion; air emission controls 
(non-automotive) to $4 billion from $3 billion, and nuclear waste management 
will cost over $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Where's the money for all this cleanup to come from, in a time of budget 
restraint in Washington? From companies and communities that have liabilities 
from current or past waste disposal. Not new laws but lawyers at work are the 
push behind cleanup today. 
</P>
<P>
Things are serious. In New Jersey today you cannot transfer ownership of 
commercial property without working out liability for past waste disposal. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has banned future use of asbestos, but commercial reality 
dictates its removal from existing buildings. "Some big companies won't rent 
space if you have asbestos in the building," says Bud Ingalls, chief financial 
officer of the Brand Cos., a Chicago area asbestos abatement contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Banks and insurance companies are looking very carefully at liabilities. "They 
won't lend without seeing a remediation (cleanup) action plan," says Joseph De 
Franco, president of Separation &amp; Recovery Systems, a hazardous waste 
treatment company in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Firms that you wouldn't think of have problems -- railroads, for instance, have 
liabilities over creosote, the traditional chemical treatment for railroad ties 
that has been judged hazardous. The railroads have pits of the stuff from 
decades past. But time does not diminish liability under environmental rules. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing how big the job is, railroads are getting into the cleanup business -- 
Union Pacific has acquired U.S. Pollution Control Industries, a small company. 
Other big companies, particularly engineering firms like Bechtel, Fluor 
</P>
<P>
and Parsons, will be getting in, too. "Environmental cleanup is a construction 
project in reverse," says analyst Hahn, "it needs a general contractor." 
</P>
<P>
The big companies will be acquiring smaller firms for their environmental 
expertise. Such names as Canonie Environmental, Groundwater Technology, 
Chambers Development can expect to become acquisition candidates -- if they're 
lucky. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tough business. Environmental projects frequently take years because 
legal wrangling over liability precedes the actual cleaning up; small firms can 
go broke waiting for revenues. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a promising business, not only here but also overseas, where 
environmental measures have lagged those of the United States. European 
countries don't even have catalytic converters on their cars. But with their 
leaders discussing environmental issues this weekend in Paris, things are 
changing there, too. And cleaning up is poised to become a world growth 
industry in the '90s.

MILKENANGELO?

<TEXT>
<P>
Men of vision and purpose are not easily daunted. 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true in the case of Michael Milken who, thankfully, has 
decided to utilize his tremendous talent and energy in positive ways by 
continuing to offer his unrivaled counsel to the business community. ("Milken 
Resigns Drexel Post, Will Open Southland Consulting Firm," June 16.) 
</P>
<P>
"The will to do, the soul to dare," as Sir Walter Scott wrote, has been 
reflected in the human spirit throughout history. Handicapped by arthritis, 
Renoir, with brushes taped to his hands, continued to paint masterpieces; when 
he could no longer hear his music, Beethoven composed some of his greatest 
symphonies. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think it's overstating the point that Milken belongs in the same 
company with these revered artists. Under tremendous personal pressures that 
would have sent most of us into an irreversible tailspin, he has found a way to 
continue to help people build businesses.

NO DEFENSE FOR FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding your June 11 Viewpoints column, "Should Defense Firms Switch From 
Swords to Plowshares?": 
</P>
<P>
Having done some business with defense contractors, I know that retraining 
workers on the production line is not a problem. That's a matter of a few weeks 
at most. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is in feather-bedded management. How is somebody going to learn to 
be competitive in the marketplace on a fixed-price item? In civilian 
production, cost overruns are not forgiven or accommodated. Cost overruns mean 
bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
Universities should gear up to teach executives how to get along with fewer 
people, how to cut salaries, including their own, and how to motivate workers 
to do quality work and fire those who don't do the job. If universities are 
unprepared to teach courses like these because the professors lack the 
background, they can enlist qualified instructors from the world of small 
business entrepreneurs.

HOW THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENED IN ARIZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PHOENIX 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the go-go, boom-boom days, they said what happened to savings and loans in 
Texas could never happen here. 
</P>
<P>
Highflying thrifts lent millions on tracts of desert dirt, but Arizona was 
different, they thought. Land flipped from buyer to buyer at higher and higher 
prices. S&amp;Ls offered loans without down payments, and some even made 
themselves partners in risky ventures. Even the oldest, most conservative 
savings banks got caught up in the pandemonium. 
</P>
<P>
But the multibillion-dollar bust in Texas, the birthplace of the nation's 
S&amp;L crisis, would never happen here, they said. 
</P>
<P>
It did. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the eight S&amp;Ls based in the Phoenix area are insolvent and have 
been taken over by regulators. The real estate market is in a free fall. 
Quarterly losses have run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Estimates 
of taxpayers' costs to clean up just the Arizona thrifts climb as high as $6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar to Texas 
</P>
<P>
"I think what happened in Phoenix is very similar to what happened in Texas," 
said Gene Rice, chairman of MeraBank, Arizona's largest thrift. "The market 
became overbuilt because of too much optimism in financial institutions and 
out-of-town investors. Then, when it collapsed, everyone ran for a corner." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, added thrift analyst William Ferguson, "appears headed in almost the 
exact direction Texas went in. The ratios look about the same." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the collapse of the thrift industry in Arizona, far removed from 
the plunge in oil prices that helped trigger the Texas debacle, points out how 
pervasive the S&amp;L crisis is, and how few lessons the industry has learned 
from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
In Arizona, the worst is not over, and in the end, taxpayers will be stuck with 
a lot of tracts of dusty desert far outside Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the bill awaiting taxpayers for the Arizona problem is only a 
fraction of the $50-billion to $75-billion tab for Texas, and experts say 
Arizona didn't suffer as much fraud as the Lone Star State. But on a percentage 
basis, the Arizona crisis actually looks worse than Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Texas has 204 thrifts; Arizona has only 11. Five of them -- all in Phoenix -- 
are insolvent, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. In Texas, 90 
S&amp;Ls were declared insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
"There's tremendous concentration in this market," said Bob Stallings, chairman 
of Western Savings, who was recruited last spring from a Dallas thrift. "I'm 
seeing some of the same problems here and, in fact, even worse." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rise of Repossessed Assets 
</P>
<P>
Repossessed assets at Arizona thrifts rose from $207 million at the end of 1986 
to $1 billion at the end of 1988. Regulatory capital, a measure of the 
institutions' solvency, has plunged to $343 million in 1988 from $1.13 billion 
in 1986. Earnings have reversed to a $657-million loss in 1988 from a 
$110-million profit in 1985, with an additional $195-million loss in the first 
three months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
And a recent poll in Phoenix found that despite the government's $100,000 
deposit insurance, six out of 10 consumers believed that S&amp;Ls were risky 
places for their savings. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona officials have gone to Washington to ask for special consideration in 
the Bush Administration's S&amp;L bailout plan and to plead for a guarantee 
that the land won't be dumped at fire-sale prices. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators now control the bulk of thrifts' real estate assets in Arizona -- 
more than $10 billion worth. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important economic factor in Arizona is what happens with the Bush 
plan," said state Banking Commissioner Hank Rivoir. "The (regulators) could 
kill Arizona's economy for years to come, or they could give us just a flesh 
wound." 
</P>
<P>
Like Texas, Arizona has a liberal real estate law that allowed the risky 
S&amp;L lending practices. 
</P>
<P>
When Texas was booming, developers armed with easy-to-get loans overbuilt; when 
oil turned down, the market crashed. In Arizona, an overbuilt market began to 
crash after the 1986 federal tax law removed tax breaks for some real estate 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate values actually have fallen faster than they did in Texas, 
Stallings said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buyers Stay on Sidelines 
</P>
<P>
The crash is the result of concern about the future of the insolvent thrifts 
and whether the government will end up dumping assets. For now, potential 
buyers are on the sidelines, watching prices plummet. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is pushing down trying to find the bottom. You keep pushing, and 
there's nothing there," he said. "Dallas-Fort Worth was never as bad as values 
indicated they were, and I'm seeing the same thing here." 
</P>
<P>
Western Savings, Stallings' thrift, is much like some Texas S&amp;Ls. One of 
Arizona's oldest thrifts and today the state's second largest, Western plunged 
into aggressive real estate lending, much of which turned sour. It needed big 
returns on investments to repay depositors. It even ventured into the junk 
bonds and preferred stock of a much-troubled Dallas real estate investment 
firm, Southmark Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Western lost. A $46.5-million investment in Southmark is now worth less than 
$10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Like other Arizona thrifts, Western has offered depositors some of the highest 
interest rates in the country just to keep money in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators forced the ouster of Western's top management and encouraged 
Stallings' hiring. But it was too late. In June, regulators declared Western 
insolvent and took control. 
</P>
<P>
MeraBank had losses of $209 million last year and $29.2 million in the first 
quarter of this year. Analysts say that despite its more conservative 
management, MeraBank teeters on the verge of insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
"With the way the Arizona market has tanked, even the best-run thrifts have 
trouble surviving," said SNL Securities analyst James Marks. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime MeraBank chairman Rice says he's been through five downturns in the 
S&amp;L industry, each one worse than the previous. 
</P>
<P>
"In good times, everyone thinks it will last forever. In bad times, everyone 
thinks it will never turn around. And they're both wrong," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift does have the advantage of an agreement between regulators and its 
parent company, Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which also owns the state's 
largest public utility. The agreement is that Pinnacle will maintain adequate 
levels of capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressing for Mercy 
</P>
<P>
Rivoir, the banking commissioner, has assembled an advisory committee and gone 
to Washington to press for mercy. Stallings has proposed his own plan and met 
with business leaders whom he says are eager to help. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts are hiring loan experts from Texas and importing some of the techniques 
developed there to survive the thrift crisis, said Phoenix banking consultant 
Deborah Bateman. 
</P>
<P>
But investors and thrift executives can do little more than wait for Washington 
to decide their fate. Bateman said she knows of investors who are ready to grab 
banks, thrifts and their assets dirt-cheap, but regulators have put everything 
on hold until the Bush plan is passed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got conservators that are baby sitters right now," she said. "Nothing is 
going on."

JAPAN'S H-2 ROCKET PROGRAM SPUTTERING TOWARD TAKEOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<DATELINE>

TOKYO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The H-2 rocket, Japan's great hope for entering the international 
satellite-launching market, is hurtling toward a commercial void, little able 
to pose serious competition to Europe or the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for blastoff in early 1992, the H-2 will be Japan's first entirely 
home-built rocket and will enable the nation to launch satellites in the 
international market for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Launch costs look astronomical, and industry analysts say the rocket will be 
unable to compete with U.S. and European satellite launchers for at least five 
years after the 1992 launching. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the government subsidizes it, the H-2 satellite launches will not be 
cost-competitive against the Europeans and the Americans in the medium term of 
five to 10 years," said Keisuke Kasagi, aerospace analyst at brokerage W. I. 
Carr (Overseas) Ltd. in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, lead contractor in the development of the 
rocket, is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no answer at this time on whether H-2 will be more expensive to start 
with than its competitors," said Toshio Masutani, general manager of the space 
systems department at Mitsubishi Heavy. 
</P>
<P>
The H-2 will be able to put into orbit satellites weighing a total of 2.2 
metric tons, the same as the Ariane 4 launched by France's Arianespace and 
competitive with the 2.4-ton space shuttle of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costly Prototype 
</P>
<P>
The government has set a target of 14.72 billion yen ($105.35 million) for the 
cost of building the first H-2 rocket, according to Nippon Oils &amp; Fats, a 
supplier of rocket fuel. 
</P>
<P>
That figure includes only the manufacture and material costs of a single H-2 
and is divorced from the massive funds being spent on developing a prototype. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi's Masutani said engineers are working hard to reduce the cost of 
building the rocket and analysts agreed that ruthless cost-cutting may show 
considerable success. 
</P>
<P>
The stumbling block is fuel. 
</P>
<P>
The H-2's sophisticated double-stage boosters require 99 tons of liquid 
hydrogen and 118 tons of solid propellant. 
</P>
<P>
The solid fuel will cost about 670 million yen ($4.78 million), industry 
sources said. Liquid hydrogen is much more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for oxygen-hydrogen supplier Toyo Sanso KK said 99 tons of liquid 
fuel costs about 2.828 billion yen ($20.2 million). 
</P>
<P>
Comparative costs for European and U.S. rockets were not available, but 
analysts said the H-2 may be seen as a fuel guzzler for two reasons. 
</P>
<P>
One is weight. Arianespace launches from an equatorial site in French Guiana so 
rockets soar straight into orbit over the Equator, an optimum position for 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
The H-2 needs an elaborate, heavy steering system to guide it from its launch 
pad in Tanegashima in southern Japan to pierce the earth's atmosphere above the 
Equator. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have a 10% (efficiency) loss because we are not underneath the 
Equator, but this is our national policy, so there is no way to change," said 
Mitsubishi's Masutani. 
</P>
<P>
The H-2's double-stage engine, in which the second booster roars into action 
during the rocket's ascent, is also seen as a voracious fuel guzzler. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is currently unable to launch satellites for other countries with its 
existing H-1 rocket without prior permission from the United States, which 
helped build it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Preoccupied' With Rocket 
</P>
<P>
Many here view the H-2, which annually claims the lion's share of the space 
budget, as a project of national pride. 
</P>
<P>
"I am preoccupied with the H-2 rocket. This is a major project for Japan which 
we must make succeed," said Yutaka Kume, president of Nissan Motor. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Japan may try to corner the quality end of the market by gaining 
a reputation for infallibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in the future satellites will be much more expensive systems, much 
bigger and much higher priced," said Mitsubishi's Masutani. "So I think 
customers' first requirement will be reliability. They need a 100% successful 
launch record," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Insurance companies are also watching very carefully which systems are the 
most reliable," he said, noting that insurance for satellites is very costly. 
</P>
<P>
In order to gain a reputation for reliability, Masutani said the H-2 will have 
three or four test launches over the two and a half years after its debut in 
1992.

WHEN THE LOBBYISTS THROW A LEARNING CURVE

<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine how Californians would feel if lobbyists for the automobile industry 
drafted a bill to reduce state regulation of automobile emissions and labeled 
it a "reform." Or if lobbyists for the cigarette industry designed legislation 
to strike down state restrictions on smoking in public places. 
</P>
<P>
This is precisely what the national textbook industry is now doing in 
Sacramento. Lobbyists for the Assn. of American Publishers and individual 
textbook publishers have written legislation to change the way state and local 
districts buy textbooks. The lobbyists persuaded Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) to 
introduce the bill (SB 594), and its sponsors claim that it will "reform" state 
textbook adoption procedures. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bill's original sponsors, the Council for Basic Education in 
Washington, withdrew support when it realized that the measure served only the 
interests of the textbook industry. Without this organizational fig leaf, the 
Maddy bill stood undisguised as the industry bill. 
</P>
<P>
The publishers' lobbyists won the endorsement of the California Teachers Assn. 
by promising classroom educators a majority on the state committees that review 
textbooks, but their bill does not provide funds to compensate substitutes for 
absent teachers. Nor do the lobbyists care that the bill simultaneously reduces 
the slots available on textbook review panels for mathematicians, scientists, 
historians and other subject-matter specialists. 
</P>
<P>
This seems to be a precedent -- the first time the textbook industry has openly 
intervened to lobby for legislation that sets the ground rules for the 
consumers of their products. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, text publishers who want to win a place on the state's recommended 
list must meet state standards of quality in the various subject areas. The 
state list serves as a consumer report for teachers and local districts. 
</P>
<P>
California spends more than $400 million each year on textbooks for 11% of the 
nation's public-school children -- the biggest textbook market in the country. 
For years, textbook publishers have competed to win a spot on the state's 
recommended list. But many of them became annoyed when the state began raising 
quality standards in science, mathematics and reading. Publishers first 
grumbled but complied. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, publishers are supposed to submit new history texts; once again they 
have been told that the current crop of books is not good enough. The state 
framework insists on the kind of stirring prose -- and visual materials -- that 
will interest kids in history. For the first time in recent memory, small 
publishers have a chance to compete with the major houses, since "boutique" 
publishers can produce vivid narratives just as well as (perhaps better than) 
bureaucratic conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the prospect of open competition proved too much for the industry. 
The response was to draft legislation that would emasculate the entire adoption 
process. In the original version of SB 594, the state was required to accept 
virtually everything any publisher submitted, without regard to standards of 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors claimed that this legislation would "reform" textbooks and eliminate 
"state control," but in fact it would have stripped the consumers -- local 
boards, teachers and students -- of any voice in the marketplace. Without state 
adoption standards, publishers would have no incentive to change existing texts 
-- the same books already reviewed as bland, superficial and devoid of 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the original Maddy bill, such nationally prominent educators as 
Chester Finn Jr., assistant secretary of education in the Reagan 
Administration, wrote to complain that it would subvert the new history 
curriculum. So the textbook industry lobbyists watered down their bill. 
</P>
<P>
The current version, still wending its way through the State Legislature, 
retains state adoption but on terms defined by lobbyists for the textbook 
industry. About the only feature left of the original Maddy measure is that it 
turns over control of the State Curriculum Commission and all textbook review 
commissions to teachers, replacing a policy in which no group holds a majority. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, the text publishers moved their political campaign to another 
arena. Lobbyists for the publishers' association opposed a motion before the 
State Board of Education to allow teachers and local school districts the right 
to spend as much as 30% of textbook funds on educational materials that are not 
textbooks. Until now, only 20% of public funds could be spent on novels, 
biographies, histories, computer programs, plays and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
The publishers lost this one, fortunately. On Friday, the state board agreed to 
give teachers the discretion of spending up to 30% of public funds on 
non-textbook materials, thus supporting the right of teachers to select the 
books they want to use, even if they are not textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Inadequate textbooks have contributed to the dumbing down of American 
education. If the industry succeeds in derailing reform of curricula and texts 
by lobbying the state Legislature, the children of California -- and the nation 
-- will be the losers.

CHENEY FIGHTS TO REFORM, NUNN FIGHTS FOR POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When new Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney embarrassed President George Bush 
by casually offering an opinion that the Soviet Union's glasnost experiment 
might fail, institutional Washington groaned. Everybody had been waiting for 
Cheney, who leads a politically charmed life, to make his first boner. No way 
Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, a cautious pro, would have uttered that 
kind of slip, pundits mused. Too bad Nunn isn't running the Pentagon, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet consider: Cheney's first months in office show he possesses an admirable 
grasp of both defense requirements and Defense Department bureaucratic 
tomfoolery. Cheney has already stuck his neck out with several challenges to 
Pentagon inertia, making him an intriguing study in contrasts with Nunn, the 
Senate Armed Services Committee chairman. Hyped by the Washington pundit corps 
as a power broker in defense affairs, Nunn continues his ultra-safe policy of 
looking the "thoughtful observer" but abjuring any action that might disturb 
the Pentagon status quo. Cheney is fighting to reform the Pentagon by saying 
what he thinks and taking chances; Nunn is fighting to hold his prestige by 
saying little and doing less. 
</P>
<P>
One of Cheney's first acts was to cut $10 billion, a serious sum, from the 
fiscal 1990 defense budget request. He did this not by the time-honored ruse of 
"stretch outs" -- buying weapons over a longer period but at a higher price per 
unit. Cheney actually named projects to cancel, including the V-22 Osprey 
tilt-rotor aircraft, the F-14D naval interceptor and the aerospace plane. The 
latter is a project aimed at creating a sort of cross between a fighter plane 
and the space shuttle, so expensive it might make the B-2 bomber seem like a 
K-mart special. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, Cheney ordered Pentagon planners to use real numbers in 
long-term projections. Throughout the Caspar W. Weinberger years, countless 
Pentagon exercises in unrealism were made possible by budget assumptions -- no 
future inflation or dramatic annual increases in appropriations. The General 
Accounting Office estimates the current five-year defense spending plan is $93 
billion out of whack. Reality-based planning is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Cheney unveiled his plan for procurement reform, fulfilling a Bush 
campaign pledge. Cheney's recommendations resemble those of Ronald Reagan's 
Packard Commission: a big cut in procurement personnel (on the theory that, at 
a certain level of overstaffing, bureaucrats devote so much energy to writing 
each other memos that their purpose gets forgotten); meaningful authority for 
the procurement undersecretary, and another attempt to form a high-level 
procurement review committee. Recent iterations of this, with such names as 
Defense Systems Acquisition Review Council and Defense Resources Board, have 
been co-opted into glorified rubber stamps. 
</P>
<P>
What has Nunn been up to? He has spent the first six months of the new Congress 
maneuvering on the MX-Midgetman missile funding controversy, an issue with a 
high quotient of media sex appeal, but one that may be rendered moot by a 
strategic arms reduction treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Most Republicans in Congress want to put 50 existing 10-warhead MX missiles on 
trains for partially mobile basing; most Democrats want a new generation of 
truly mobile single-warhead Midgetmen. The Democratic Party has a political 
investment in the latter concept: It was invented by Nunn and Sen. Albert Gore 
Jr. of Tennessee so Democrats could vote against the MX while declaring, with 
full macho, that they had a better missile in mind. Midgetman would have 
several nuclear-stability advantages over MX, but since single warheads would 
be carried in single missile-transporter combos, they will also be far more 
expensive. This is perhaps the first major defense issue in postwar history 
where conservatives favor the cheaper option. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn has been shuttling to the White House, lecturing Bush and Cheney on the 
fine points of projected Midgetman appropriations for the mid-1990s, going so 
far as to warn that any strategic arms reduction treaty won't pass the Senate 
unless Bush drops his posture of asking the Soviets to dismantle their mobile 
ICBMs in return for our agreement to forgo building any. That's right -- 
Democrats are insisting a Republican President not persuade the Soviets to 
demolish a nuclear weapon. 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of issue Nunn likes: technocratic quibbling, done under the 
kind of big-deal circumstances that guarantee invitations to Sunday morning 
talk shows. When it comes to nuts and bolts, Nunn has almost never worked to 
cancel a bad weapon or cut an overstaffed department. For example, the biggest 
Pentagon reform since Nunn became chairman of Armed Services -- reorganization 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- was championed not by Nunn but by GOP Sen. 
Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn's fear of offending the Pentagon where it really hurts, in funding and 
personnel, stems in part from his representing Georgia, a state of military 
bases and defense contractors. It may also be in his genes. Nunn's great-uncle 
was Rep. Carl Vinson, longtime chairman of the House Armed Services Committee 
and a man legendary for never saying no to the military. Today there's a U.S. 
aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, and not because the military wanted to 
commemorate its eponym's war record or statesmanship: Naming a ship after the 
politician who kept the funds flowing is a way for the Pentagon to send a 
message that anyone who plays by its rules may someday be remembered. There'll 
never be a USS Richard Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
One reason British seamen fight so bravely may be the inspirational names of 
their ships. They sailed to the Falklands on vessels christened not after 
committee chairmen but with names such as HMS Brilliant, Invincible and 
Broadsword. Perhaps future U.S. sailors will ship out on the USS Caspar 
Weinberger, Spirit of Overruns or Lee Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
How have Cheney's initiatives fared? Nunn's committee has not yet acted on 
them; the House Armed Services Committee, chaired by Rep. Les Aspin of 
Wisconsin (hmm . . . fine name for a minesweeper) has. Aspin swore, "this time 
it's different," that his committee would resist restoring pork-barrel programs 
Cheney wanted to cancel. Sure enough, the committee voted to do just that. Days 
later it voted again -- to add nearly $10 billion to the acquisition budget, 
funding the V-22 and F-14D, among others. It was classic Capitol Hill double 
talk, allowing congressmen to come down squarely on both sides of an issue. 
</P>
<P>
What are the merits of Cheney's proposed cuts? The V-22 project causes a 
genuine quandary. It calls for construction of an aircraft that could take off 
vertically, then tilt its propellers to fly like an airplane. The V-22 would 
perform roles now played by heavy helicopters, but fly farther, faster and be 
harder to shoot down. The trouble is V-22s are fantastically expensive, about 
$30 million each -- more than twice the costliest helicopter. The V-22 makers, 
a consortium of Boeing and Bell, assert this high price would hold only at the 
start; after production got rolling, the price would fall. But we've heard that 
before. Cheney is said to have suspected price-gouging. Congress may be happy 
to play along. 
</P>
<P>
The F-14 is another story. This aircraft is a nearly 20-year-old design -- a 
huge, hard-to-fly fighter the Navy is phasing out in favor of the modern F-18. 
Among other things, the F-14 requires more maintenance than any combat aircraft 
in the current front-line inventory. Continuing F-14 production would be little 
more than a federal subsidy to Grumann, its manufacturer. During the House 
committee session, Democratic Rep. George J. Hochbrueckner from Long Island, 
N.Y. -- where Grumann is headquartered -- gave a heart-tugging speech about his 
patriotic commitment to the aircraft while waving plastic models the way kids 
do. Committee members applauded, then authorized $1 billion for just 12 F-14Ds 
-- an absurdly inefficient production rate. They might as well have voted a 
special dividend directly to Grumann stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
On the aerospace plane front, funding has been kept alive after the personal 
intervention of Vice President Dan Quayle, who -- as chairman of the new 
National Space Council -- said he was not discouraged by the many technical 
objections against anything other than general research into aerospace 
technology. Remember that Spiro T. Agnew, another vice president with a 
sophisticated grasp of space science, once declared the United States would 
have men on Mars by 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Cheney's proposed changes will be lauded in the abstract but opposed 
in the specific by Pentagon dead weight and congressmen whose districts might 
suffer from genuine discipline. Interestingly, Cheney, who wanted a businessman 
as undersecretary for procurement ("weapons czar"), sounded out more than 20 
candidates before he found John A. Betti, an executive in Ford's technology 
division, willing to take the job. 
</P>
<P>
In press reports this has been attributed to distaste with the position's 
powerlessness. The opposite is true. People line up around the block for 
impressive-sounding but powerless Pentagon slots, such as civilian service 
secretaryships. In these jobs, one may log two years of tedious ceremonial 
appearances then sashay through the revolving door to a six-figure life of 
placing a few influence-peddling phone calls as a consultant or vice president 
of an aerospace concern. If, however, the weapons czar had the power to crack 
down on contractors, who would shower money on him later? It was Cheney's 
desire to make the weapons czar job meaningful that scared people away.

Abortion is a surface solution to a root problem. The root problem is the 
unwillingness of men and women to accept the consequences of their choice to 
have sex. The exercise of one's free choice to have sex has social 
consequences, be it babies or sexually transmitted diseases. With freedom comes 
responsibility. Any exercise of personal rights must be balanced against the 
rights of others, including the unborn. I applaud the court's move to correct 
the self-centered mentality of this "me-first" generation.

CONTROVERSY OVER SUPREME COURT'S ABORTION DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the wide range of opinions advanced by the Supreme Court on abortion, it 
is obvious that its nine justices are not guided by basic law but are simply 
voicing their separate prejudices -- echoing, for the most part, those of the 
Presidents who appointed them. 
</P>
<P>
Is this the way the law should be determined? Should the moral views of 
Presidents, of legislators, of sects and our Puritan elders be imposed upon 
all? 
</P>
<P>
"Morality" seems to vary in direct proportion to wealth and how tight the thumb 
screw of necessity is tightened. Our well-fed Reagans, Bushes, Ed Meeses, and 
Orrin Hatches -- all males -- can well afford their exalted puritan postures. 
They have it made. Would their attitudes change if they were teen-age tenement 
girls, with only one dress fit for school, and that one getting too tight? Let 
them be destitute, hungry, pregnant, and thinking of suicide, and we'll see. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy will be settled, in the end, by the law of necessity. As the 
pressures of population and pollution rise, the moral aristocrats will hear 
them as the rattle of tumbrels. ELLIOT W. MICHENER

TIME TO HEED CONSUMER CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California must take stronger action to assure that its food supply is safe 
from pesticides that can cause cancer and other illnesses. The Legislature may 
be on the verge of passing a measure that purports to provide that protection 
but ignores critical problems. The lawmakers should be talking more about 
phasing out carcinogenic pesticides and phasing in pest control measures that 
reduce reliance on harmful chemicals. Instead, they seem intent on taking 
half-measures to head off a potential ballot initiative. Failing to heed 
consumer concerns now could be a big mistake and lead to harsher controls 
enacted by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly has just passed AB 2161, sponsored by Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan 
(D-Fresno). It would establish a long-overdue testing program for pesticide 
residues in processed foods, expand monitoring of raw agricultural products and 
improve protection for infants and toddlers who can tolerate less exposure to 
some pesticides than adults can. 
</P>
<P>
Bronzan's bill is fine as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. It 
gives the agricultural and chemical industries too much control over pesticide 
regulation and takes too little action to reduce pesticide use. Critics like 
Ralph Lightstone of the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation point out, 
for example, that there is already a state law requiring a plan for monitoring 
processed food. The Department of Health Services "prepared the plan, which was 
apparently not welcomed by some industry groups," says Lightstone. "It was 
never formally released, and has been gathering dust in the governor's office 
for the past four years." 
</P>
<P>
More can and must be done. Based on extensive animal testing, the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency has already identified, but not acted against, 
13 pesticides that either clearly cause cancer in humans or probably do so. 
These pesticides include alachlor, a weed-killer used on beans and corn, and 
captan, a fungicide used on fruits and vegetables. Federal indecisiveness 
should not stop California, which has long had higher standards. AB 417, 
proposed by Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly (D-Sacramento) would phase out these 
chemicals over a 5-to-8-year period. The acutely hazardous pesticide aldicarb, 
used on watermelons and cucumbers, would also be phased out. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly's bill, which the Legislature so far has ignored, also calls for more 
research into alternative pest-control methods. It also would transfer 
decisions about health impacts of pesticides from the state Department of Food 
and Agriculture to the health department. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups support Connelly's bill; growers and chemical 
manufacturers support Bronzan's bill. The environmentalists and farm-worker 
attorneys are considering a pesticide-safety ballot initiative along the lines 
of Connelly's bill. In a fair fight -- one not fought with tons of money and 
simplistic slogans -- odds are that the same voters who approved the insurance 
initiative could be persuaded to go for tighter pesticide controls. 
</P>
<P>
Once again the Legislature's credibility and concern for public interest is at 
stake. It should not try cosmetic touches but should have an open and thorough 
dialogue about real public concerns. It probably won't. And once again 
lawmaking may slip out of lawmakers' hands.

CONTROVERSY OVER SUPREME COURT'S ABORTION DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To all the pro-choice feminists and their followers: Please stop hiding behind 
those masks of concerned groups for the poor and needy women to legalize 
abortion. Besides, babies don't kill their mothers on the abortion tables, it 
is the mother and her supporters who kill the baby. We can't close our eyes and 
ears to individual responsibility. This responsibility does not depend on 
taxpayers' money but only on the active consciousness of each individual: women 
and men alike. 
</P>
<P>
The poor and needy women, as well as the aborted babies, are only scapegoats, 
an excuse for our hardened hearts and very rational minds. If we truly want to 
protect our individual rights, then let's stop depending on the government's 
money and let's start doing something by our own free choice, like teaching our 
children at home about love and respect for human life, for one another and, 
especially, for our own bodies, minds and hearts. Only when we give that love 
and respect to ourselves can we expect the same from the others. 
</P>
<P>
May God help us all in this battle for innocent lives.

CONTROVERSY OVER SUPREME COURT'S ABORTION DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court upheld the Missouri statutes concerning abortion. Since the 
Roe vs. Wade decision was passed down by the Supreme Court in 1973 much has 
been discovered about the development of the baby within the mother's womb. One 
such discovery is that after just a few days a heartbeat and brain waves can be 
detected. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-abortion protagonists base their position upon the "woman's right to 
choose." This type of reasoning is at best faulty because it fails to consider 
the human rights of the unborn child living within the womb of its mother. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion is not only a moral issue, it is a constitutional one. Unborn children 
have the same cherished rights, as the Declaration of Independence states, to 
"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," as well as such constitutional 
rights to "due process" and protection from "cruel and unusual punishment." 
</P>
<P>
The constitutional rights of the unborn must be protected.

Regarding the abortion controversy ("Dislike Abortion Ruling? We Voted for It," 
by Martin Schram, Op-Ed Page, July 10), are there others, like me, who have had 
their pro-choice leanings strengthened because of the actions of the pro-life 
demonstrators? They seem to show so much hostility to the women who have made 
this choice. I get the feeling many of them want the women punished for 
perceived sexual transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
I do not think a baby should ever be a punishment.

WHY BUILD NEW CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES WHEN EASTERN CLASSROOMS GO BEGGING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MUELLER, John Mueller grew up in Los Angeles, attended the University 
of Chicago, received his graduate education at UCLA, and now teaches at the 
University of Rochester (which, while doing well at attracting students, would 
be happy to have more Californians). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Demographics are creating an absurdity for higher education. In much of the 
country -- particularly the Northeast and Midwest -- the number of high school 
graduates is declining. As a result, colleges and universities there are 
experiencing reduced enrollments and in some cases are going out of business. 
Meanwhile, California is thinking about pouring tax money into the creation of 
universities (including three new, fantastically expensive University of 
California campuses) to handle its burgeoning surplus of young people. 
</P>
<P>
The solution to this absurdity is clear. Instead of building new schools, 
California would be better off using at least some of its money to encourage 
Californians to go to college back East. 
</P>
<P>
Not counting the ever-accelerating expense of building a campus in the first 
place, it costs at least $20,000 to educate the average undergraduate at the 
University of California. If each qualified California high school graduate 
were automatically awarded a state scholarship of a fraction of that amount to 
go to school elsewhere, many of them would enter Eastern schools, filling 
classes there and saving Californians millions -- eventually billions -- in tax 
money. To avoid simply rewarding the rich, many of whom already send their 
children to Eastern colleges, the scholarships could be graduated by income. 
</P>
<P>
There is something of a precedent: New York state has a tuition-assistance 
program that gives money to New York students to go to any college, public or 
private, in the state. A California version would allow its students to use the 
money at any acceptable school in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Although the higher-education system in California is excellent in many ways, 
it has tended to reduce the mix of educational opportunities for Californians. 
Because of the existence of huge, attractive, low-tuition state schools, 
smaller, more-individualized private colleges have never developed in 
California the way they have in the East. By assisting Californians to attend 
such schools, the state would not only save enormous amounts of tax money; it 
also would provide a wider range of higher-education alternatives for broad 
segments of its population -- not just for the rich. And it can't hurt 
California if more of its future leaders have early contact with their peers in 
other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
A California tuition-assistance program also could change with the times. If, 
for example, California found its population of high school graduates to be 
declining, it could reduce the program, encouraging more students to stay home. 
If it builds new campuses to handle its looming surplus, it might eventually 
find itself with a set of expensive, useless buildings to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
The program should appeal to those who are concerned about putting some 
controls on California's remarkable, but sometimes harmful, growth. The planned 
new campuses, of course, will create jobs and stimulate the economy, but at the 
same time they will tend to drive colleges and universities in the East out of 
business, encouraging people there to join the crowd moving to California. If 
the money were used instead to improve transportation or reduce pollution, or 
if it were returned to the citizens in lowered taxes, the same funds would aid 
California's economy but without wastefully creating unemployment in the East. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the state education system is to provide quality higher-education 
opportunities for deserving Californians. It does not follow, however, that 
these opportunities must be found within California. 
</P>
<P>
It may seem more than a bit radical to suggest that state tax money be used to 
support out-of-state colleges, but the state now buys plenty of things from 
other states when they can be obtained more inexpensively there. Why not 
education as well? By encouraging more of its high school graduates to attend 
colleges outside the state, California could save money, moderate its growth, 
increase the variety of educational opportunities for its citizens, maintain 
flexibility to meet future needs and help the many fine colleges whose only 
mistake has been to be located in some other state.

ALICE KAHN: A BIRTHDAY PARTY TAKES THE CAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a mythic figure somewhere between Mother Goose and the Good Witch of the 
North, Dear Abby came for us. "What should I call you?" asked my 10-year-old 
daughter, Hannah. "Should I call you Abby or Dear?" 
</P>
<P>
"Call me Abby, honey," said Pauline Esther (Popo) Friedman Phillips, a.k.a. 
Abigail Van Buren. She sat not in a golden coach or a pumpkin shell but in a 
huge white stretch limo with smoked-glass windows and a bar and a phone and a 
television set and a VCR. 
</P>
<P>
"This is so cool!" Hannah whispered in my ear as we drove off into the Beverly 
Hills sunset. 
</P>
<P>
But what do you talk about with Dear Abby? Perhaps I should just turn to her 
and say what's on my mind: 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ABBY: My mother died before my daughter Hannah was born. She was such an 
indulgent grandma, always sending my older daughter, Emma, beautiful little 
dresses and toys, even if she couldn't afford them. I know it sounds 
irrational, but I keep dreaming she'll come back and do something special for 
Hannah. Am I nuts? 
</P>
<P>
FAIRY-TALE BELIEVER 
</P>
<P>
Abby had written to me. Not because I wrote to her, but out of the blue -- 
wonderful letters saying kind things about my column. I called and asked to 
take her to lunch, but she was busy churning out the six columns a week a 
working girl must do to pay the limo bill. Now, Hannah and I are her dinner 
guests. We follow her into an elegant French restaurant. I realize that Emma 
will kill me for this later. 
</P>
<P>
Rows of young waiters, like a Busby Berkeley chorus line, fall in with, "Good 
evening, Mrs. Phillips" and "Nice to see you, Abby." We are seated in her 
private dining room, which looks out over the dimly lit scene. "This way, we 
can still watch the couples smooching," she says. 
</P>
<P>
I'm reminded that she was no sob sister when she entered the old boys' world of 
journalism in the '50s. She made it on saucy one-liners, like her response to 
the reader who wrote, "What's the difference between a wife and a mistress?" 
"Night and day," Her Dearness responded. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps others, besides her hairdresser, know the secret of how Abby, who 
turned 71 on the Fourth of July, still looks like a girl of 50. As she sits 
between Hannah and me, I note her blue-and-white silk dress and matching coat, 
her pearl-and-diamond necklace, her purple pumps and purple Chanel bag, and the 
perfect red nails on her tiny white hands. 
</P>
<P>
Hannah struggles to eat the huge filet mignon, even after she has brushed aside 
the yucky stuff called foie gras. I am enjoying my duck in raspberry sauce, 
which at 24 bucks a pop ain't chopped liver. I'm acquainted with Abby's 
biography because my older daughter had done a report last year on the famous 
Sioux City twins -- Abby and her sister, Esther Pauline (Eppie) Friedman 
Lederer, a.k.a. Ann Landers. 
</P>
<P>
I tell Abby that we have a few things in common besides the fact that her dad 
from Minsk and my dad from Pinsk came to Midwestern America and opened movie 
theaters. Like her, I didn't start writing a column until my late 30s and, like 
her, I began with the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to the Chronicle, I didn't even have a Social Security number," 
Abby says. "I said I'd gladly do it for free, but they insisted I be paid." 
</P>
<P>
I suggest, "They'd take it for free today." 
</P>
<P>
Every question I ask Abby turns out to be a cliche. "What did you think of 
Nathanael West's 'Miss Lonelyhearts'?" 
</P>
<P>
"Honey, everyone always asks me that." 
</P>
<P>
Hannah asks the questions nobody has ever asked before: "Are those real 
diamonds? . . . Is that really your chauffeur? . . . Are you friends with any 
movie stars that you like?" 
</P>
<P>
Singing waiters arrive bearing a special chocolate Charlotte cake with a candle 
in it for Hannah's "birthday," which was actually three months ago. It is just 
the kind of dramatic deed my mother would have done. 
</P>
<P>
Sated with cake, Hannah announces: "This is the fanciest restaurant I have ever 
been to. This is the longest dinner I have ever sat through." 
</P>
<P>
We leave. The coach awaits us. The chauffeur-cum-bodyguard takes us to Rodeo 
Drive and follows us as we stroll. Cameras roll as celebs and long-legged 
ladies enter a Leroy Neiman gallery opening. A few doors down, there's another 
bash for an artist whose oeuvre consists of paintings of Brooke Shields on 
motorcycles. A man gets out of his Rolls-Royce and says to us, "Three girls out 
on the town?" 
</P>
<P>
Abby takes Hannah's hand and leads her up Rodeo on a docent's tour through this 
big-ticket Disneyland. Then she kisses us good night and sends us to bed. 
</P>
<P>
Later, I tell Hannah, "I wish I hadn't had wine. It seemed like such a dream." 
</P>
<P>
"But it was like a dream to me too," she says. "Did you see her rings? We're 
talking big ones." 
</P>
<P>
Hannah may remember the sparkly things -- the chandelier in the restaurant and 
Abby's diamond earrings. But when I think back to that night in Beverly Hills, 
I'll remember Mama.

ON VIEW: CHARITY ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH A DAY AT THE RACES 
</P>

Social folks are traveling up and down the coast in summer's passion for 
escape. Directors of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club John C. Mabee (president), 
Clement L. Hirsch, Joe Harper and Stewart Bowie are among those inviting pals 
to the July 26 Del Mar opening of thoroughbred racing. 
</P>
<P>
The racing charity days are jam-packed. Social Service Auxiliary of San Diego, 
headed by Sally McClenahan of La Jolla, goes to the races July 27 with a batch 
of hostesses: Kay Wall, Dot Herrick, Marjorie Edmunds, Jean Hope, Jo Brady, 
Margaret Maund. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Country Friends host 500 at the track July 31 with Connie McNally of El 
Cajon and Jean Newman of Escondido, with proceeds to go to the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
HIT BIT: Day Nursery Artisan Auxiliary hosts its sixth annual Golden Mallet 
Invitational Polo Tournament with pageantry and an alfresco luncheon today in 
Carpinteria. Gloria Holden and her daughter Geannie Holden Sheller are talking 
about chukkers. In fact, the auxiliary committee has been educating friends on 
polo etymology. A game of polo is divided into six seven-minute chukkers (a 
period of play) and a 10-to-15-minute halftime, plus a 30-second overtime. 
</P>
<P>
AGENDA: Couturier Oscar de la Renta will appear for Saks Fifth Avenue on Monday 
evening at Hotel Bel-Air to honor the UCLA Art Council, which is restaging its 
incredible Thieves Market on Oct. 27-28 in a giant hangar at Santa Monica 
Airport Center. The hangar is being crammed with collectibles by Marian Nandel 
and Muriel Simkin and cohorts. 
</P>
<P>
TOP OF THE TOP: Mix hugs and kisses with shrimp, chili and Caesar salad, stir 
in 400 well-wishers, every TV cameraman in Los Angeles. Bump Pasadena against 
Hollywood, with guests from Penny Bianchi to Barry Diller. Sift in offspring -- 
Tawnia, Chelsea and Cody Cannell. And, oh, yes, Marcia and Stephen J. Cannell 
-- crown them with stars and halos. That was the 10th anniversary of Stephen J. 
Cannell Productions Inc. the other night at Chasen's. 
</P>
<P>
What a crowd: Brandon Tartikoff, Warren Littlefield, Dr. George and Mary Regas, 
Gabriella and Dr. John Santaniello, Michael Lansbury, Juanita Barrett, Ben 
Vereen, Dan and Joni Baker, Joseph and Carolyn Cannell, Connie Selleca, Susan 
Dey, Barbara and Howard Golden. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cannell: "The first year I sort of felt like a dog that had wandered onto 
the freeway. . . . You can't measure success in Nielsen ratings and numbers of 
shows on the air. You can only measure in friends. So many of you here held our 
hands when our son, Derek, died. I learned so much about what friendships 
really mean." (The Cannells' teen-age son died in an accident eight years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
MEDICIS. At the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce's annual Medici Awards 
evening, guests circled around the Exposition Park lily pond in early twilight 
and smelled the roses. Then it was on to the California Museum of Science and 
Industry terrace for William M. Clossey's party, Caroline Ahmanson's (she's the 
dinner founder) Summary of the Arts in Los Angeles and the awards. 
</P>
<P>
Then followed Somerset Caterers' splendid feast. Actor Richard Thomas presented 
the awards to All Nippon Airways, Anheuser-Busch Co., Bullock's Department 
Store and Eastman Kodak. Prominent in the crowd were John and Liz Argue, Koji 
Yamashita, Mary Rock, Ray Remy and Wallace Smith. 
</P>
<P>
BREEZY PACE: Friends of Suzanne Marx, who has given her all to raise funds for 
the Nancy Reagan Drug Center (Diane Disney Miller recently gave another 
$100,000), is just back from son Jason's graduation from Princeton. She's to be 
honored at a cocktail buffet Wednesday evening at the home of Dr. and Mr. Kurt 
Wagner by Kathie Wagner, Liz Lewis, Poppy Paulos, Sharon Takiff and Tina 
Brackenbush. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific Bank hosted a cocktail reception at Sotheby's in Beverly Hills 
to launch the Summer Auction of Jewelry West to be held Monday at 10:15 a.m. 
and 2 p.m. at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

AMONG THE MANY LITTLE INNS IN THE FRENCH QUARTER IS SONIAT HOUSE, REGARDED AS A

<P>
Candles flame and lamps line the carriage entrance to Soniat House, where 
shadows dance across ancient walls and water spills musically into a lily pond 
. . . and the throaty whistle of a paddle-wheeler echoes off the Mississippi. 
It is the cocktail hour, and Burley Eugene, the kindly black man with the bow 
tie and huge smile, hurries up a spiral staircase clutching a bottle of 
champagne for the couple watching the horse carriages passing below their 
balcony, while gas lamps flicker in the growing darkness. 
</P>
<P>
While the couple sip the champagne, the happy music of a calliope drifts from a 
river boat and suddenly the night is filled with magic, soft street noises and 
the sweet scent of jasmine. 
</P>
<P>
In our lineup of little inns in the French Quarter, the Soniat House, at 1133 
Chartres St., stands out as a leader. Hidden in a peaceful corner, it is 
considered New Orleans' finest small inn. Offering the comfort of an earlier 
era, the Creole-style townhouse of a one-time plantation owner provides shelter 
for guests in 24 rooms, no two alike. 
</P>
<P>
English and French antique furniture from the collection of proprietor Rodney 
Smith sets Soniat House a world apart from other inns. Oriental rugs cover 
floors, and guests snooze in brass and four-poster beds alongside elaborately 
carved tables and chairs. There is the sheet-metal side table by sculptor John 
Dickinson, and walls are hung with paintings on loan from the New Orleans 
Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast at Soniat House -- fresh-baked biscuits, homemade strawberry jam and 
orange juice -- is served on Villeroy &amp; Bosh porcelain, either in one's 
room or in the courtyard with its fountain, magnolia trees, hibiscus and 
wisteria vines that climb the ancient walls. 
</P>
<P>
Some stroll around the corner to Croissant d'Or, a French patisserie that turns 
out fresh blueberry, almond and raspberry croissants, along with apple and 
praline tarts, cafe au lait, espresso and cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
Dating from 1829, Soniat House is a lovers' choice, with wrought-iron 
balconies, spiral staircases and a courtyard that inspires romance. Guest rooms 
of various sizes and shapes are priced from $100 a day single to $115/$145 
double, with suites fetching $175 to $400. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street at silver-haired Mrs. Junius Underwood's French Quarter 
Maisonettes (1130 Chartres St.), seven rooms go for the bargain rates of 
$39/$45 a day. While Soniat House features Jacuzzis in several of its rooms, 
Mrs. Underwood's Maisonettes provide showers, a settling quiet and the warm 
hospitality of Mrs. Underwood herself, who steers guests on tours throughout 
the French Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Old and snug -- the little inn dates from 1825 -- French Quarter Maisonettes 
wraps itself around a sunny flagstone courtyard where the plants are tended by 
Jesse Palmore, who has served Mrs. Underwood and her guests for more than a 
quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
Ground-floor guest units open onto the courtyard and its locked gate, while 
those overhead look down on both the courtyard and a fountain that serves as a 
centerfold for this friendly and surprisingly inexpensive hideaway whose 
neighbor is the 1734 Ursuline Convent. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its reassuring tranquillity, Mrs. Underwood's Maisonettes is only a 
short stroll from the French Market and Jackson Square, where artists set up 
easels to capture the scenes of passing carriages and buildings that have stood 
since the South's opulent pre-Civil War era. 
</P>
<P>
Vying for the attention of the discriminating guest is the little 16-room 
Maison de Ville, directly behind the Court of the Two Sisters at 727 Rue 
Toulouse and only steps off Bourbon Street. The oldest structure serving as a 
hotel in the French Quarter, Maison de Ville is a former private residence with 
rooms that overlook a fetching courtyard and a fountain where guests take their 
morning meals. 
</P>
<P>
It is here that Tennessee Williams completed "A Streetcar Named Desire." Rooms 
at Maison de Ville feature French antiques and marble fireplaces. In the 
evening there is the glow of lamps, and the air is redolent with the perfume of 
flowers. This is old, old New Orleans -- an ancient shelter squeezed between 
Bourbon Street and Rue Royal. Rates range $100/$135 for a single to $110/$145 
for a double. 
</P>
<P>
Barely a block away, the same proprietor operates the renowned Audubon Cottages 
at 505 Rue Dauphine, where naturalist James Audubon turned out several of his 
celebrated paintings. Half a dozen cottages face private courtyards, with 
guests sharing a garden and an inviting swimming pool. It was Audubon Cottages 
that Elizabeth Taylor chose as a hideaway during one of her theatrical 
appearances in New Orleans. The rates: $275/$325. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Ste. Helene: Although this little 16-room, European-style hotel falls 
into the budget category (summer rates start at $58.50), it offers excellent 
value. A complimentary continental breakfast is served in the courtyard and the 
swimming pool is an inviting attraction on one of those muggy New Orleans 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
Situated in the heart of the French Quarter, Hotel Ste. Helene (508 Chartres 
St.) was the original home of the Pacific Concert Saloon. While rooms are a 
trifle small, they are both clean and comfortable. Ask for accommodations with 
a balcony overlooking the pool. 
</P>
<P>
Rising at the far end of the French Quarter, The Frenchmen (417 Frenchmen St.) 
is both bright and cheery, with a brick courtyard, swimming pool and a deck for 
sunbathing. 
</P>
<P>
Rooms feature period pieces, air conditioning and ceiling fans. A full American 
breakfast is served on the patio or in the privacy of one's room, and snacks 
are available in the hotel's cafe. 
</P>
<P>
With its wrought-iron chairs, marble-top tables and the heady fragrance of 
magnolia blossoms, The Frenchmen exudes a true sense of the South. Its only 
disadvantage is the rather long walk to the center of the Vieux Carre. Rates: 
$64/$99, single or double (including breakfast). 
</P>
<P>
In the same neighborhood, Lamonthe House, at 621 Esplanade Ave., glows with the 
warmth of a bygone era, a Victorian gem that's crowded with gilt-edged mirrors, 
candelabra, four-posters and 18th-Century armoires. 
</P>
<P>
I recall when the late proprietress, white-haired Gertrude Munson, poured 
morning coffee from a 200-year-old Sheffield urn, returning in the evening to 
stir flaming cafe brulot, a blend of brandy, coffee, curacao and spices in a 
ritual she conducted with the aplomb of a symphony conductor. 
</P>
<P>
Now that she's gone to her reward, the urn has been retired and coffee is 
prepared instead in an ordinary vessel. Still, with the soft ticking of a 
Victorian clock and rooms filled with period pieces, one senses a feeling of 
having crossed the threshold to a time of early Southern comfort. 
</P>
<P>
The old three-story mansion with its green shutters faces Esplanade Avenue and 
magnolia trees that burst with blooms the size of popcorn balls. Lamonthe 
House: 20 rooms and suites priced $75/$195. Parking is available without 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
The bargain buy in the French Quarter is Grenoble House, at 329 Dauphine St., 
where a third-floor, split-level suite capable of sleeping six guests rents for 
$735 a week, which figures out to less than $123 per person. (One-bedroom 
suites start at $375 a week.) 
</P>
<P>
A wedding of three townhouses dating from 1834, Grenoble House offers the 
amenities of a modern hotel without losing the charm of an early New Orleans 
residence. Featured at the 17-suite inn are kitchens, exposed brick walls, 
fireplaces, lofty ceilings, spiral staircases and a combination of contemporary 
and antique furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
Guests barbecue in the bricked courtyard with its swimming pool and potted 
plants, and afterward they relax in the hotel's cheery lobby. This small, 
all-suite hotel is a block off Bourbon Street. 
</P>
<P>
Le Richelieu: This inn at 1234 Chartres St. is the hideaway of Beatle Paul 
McCartney whenever he's in town. Housed in an old mansion and an ex-macaroni 
factory, the hotel is known for its friendly staff and four-diamond AAA rating. 
</P>
<P>
Guests sunbathe on the patio, where lunch is served beside a swimming pool. 
Other meals are taken in the Terrace Cafe, and parking is complimentary. Most 
rooms at Le Richelieu are equipped with ceiling fans, and its balconies 
spotlight either the courtyard or the French Quarter. Rates: $65 single, $75 
double; suites from $185. 
</P>
<P>
Just around the corner from Soniat House, the Hotel Villa Convento at 616 
Ursuline St. is operated as a small inn by Larry and Lela Campo and has 24 
comfortably furnished rooms. Rates are surprisingly inexpensive ($39/$59), with 
suites going for $89. No. 401 offers a bird's-eye view of the Mississippi. 
Others overlook the patio and the street. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast is served in the courtyard with its fountain and garden, or one can 
step out the front door to Croissant d'Or, the French patisserie directly 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
The Cornstalk: This small hotel operating out of an 1800s mansion at 915 Royal 
St. is colorful, albeit a trifle scruffy. Just around the corner from Bourbon 
Street, it got its name from the cornstalk posts on the lacy iron fence out 
front. There are those who enjoy The Cornstalk and others who grumble that it's 
a bit seedy. Nevertheless, The Cornstalk exudes the sort of atmosphere that 
appeals to the adventurous lodger. 
</P>
<P>
The former home of the first chief justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court, The 
Cornstalk provides rooms furnished with four-poster and tester beds along with 
a display of interesting antiques. Rates from $65 single to $75 double, with a 
continental breakfast and newspaper delivered to one's room. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the French Quarter we visited the city's smartest new hotel, The 
Windsor Court at 300 Gravier St., with its smartly furnished suites, swimming 
pool, sauna and steam room. The suites have his-and-her dressing salons, wet 
bars, marble baths and kitchenettes. 
</P>
<P>
Without question, The Windsor Court is the handsomest hotel in New Orleans, its 
corridors lined with art and its lobby providing the feeling of an expansive 
den. It is here that high tea is served each afternoon to the accompaniment of 
chamber music. The Windsor Court: 300 rooms and suites ($145/$195).

HOT PROPERTY: PARADISE LOST FOR 'MAGNUM' CO-STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHN HILLERMAN, who co-starred with Tom Selleck as Jonathan Higgins in the TV 
series "Magnum P.I.," has put his Waikiki penthouse on the market. 
</P>
<P>
"When doing 'Magnum,' it was my principal home for eight years," he said, "but 
I am no longer working over there. I'd like to keep a foot in Hawaii, but I 
can't quite justify owning anything so grand." 
</P>
<P>
The 10-room, 3,500-square-foot penthouse -- on the 38th floor of a residential 
tower -- has a 280-degree view from the ocean to the mountains, including 
Diamond Head. Asking price is $3.6 million; the penthouse is listed with 
Diamond Realty in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Hillerman is renting a penthouse near the Hollywood Bowl while negotiating with 
Universal Studios to do another series. "I'd love to do something again with 
Tom (Selleck)," he said, "and I will, if the opportunity ever arises, but he's 
doing movies now, and I like the routine of a series." 
</P>
<P>
When Hillerman sells his Waikiki penthouse, he said, "I'll buy a little place 
in Hawaii and a place here." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he bought a home at Lake Arrowhead. It has an elevator and a 
floor-to-ceiling TV screening room. "I spend about three days a week here," he 
said from his Hollywood apartment, "and I spend the rest of the time at Lake 
Arrowhead. I have a boat on the lake, and I love it there." 
</P>
<P>
JACK BENNY'S former estate, in the old movie colony area of Palm Springs, has 
been sold. 
</P>
<P>
The late comedian used to live there in the late '50s and early '60s, said Tom 
Ogle of Century 21/Van Lizzen Realty in Palm Springs, who represented the 
seller. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old home has been sold a couple times since Benny owned it, 
according to Ogle, and this time, it went for only $360,000 despite its 
amenities: a total of six bedrooms, including two in a guest house facing a 
swimming pool, and a circular drive and electric gates. 
</P>
<P>
"It was considered a fixer," Ogle explained. 
</P>
<P>
He described the buyer as a corporate executive from Los Angeles, who plans to 
remodel the home and use it for entertaining large parties. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of party houses, a rumor streaked through the real estate community 
last week that the Sultan of Brunei is buying producer AARON and CANDY 
SPELLING'S still-unfinished, 56,000-square-foot Holmby Hills mega-mansion for 
$65 million. 
</P>
<P>
But Spelling's spokesman, publicist Warren Cowan, denied the rumor. "There is 
no truth to it," he emphasized, "and Candy says, 'No way. We have no intention 
of selling it now or forever.' " 
</P>
<P>
MARGE DURANTE, widow of the late Jimmy Durante, was honored the other day with 
the dedication of The Durante Pub, off the lobby of The Inn at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The Inn, a $40-million development of Winners Circle Resorts International, 
will open July 28, about the same time as the July 26 opening of the Del Mar 
racing season. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel, with 123 guest accommodations, was built on the site of the original 
Hotel Del Mar, which was a popular getaway place for Durante and such other 
Hollywood greats as Bing Crosby, Rudolph Valentino and Rita Hayworth. The Hotel 
Del Mar was razed in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
MARK HUGHES, founder and president of Herbalife International (manufacturers of 
vitamins, nutritional supplements and weight-loss products), has purchased a 
new, 10,000-square-foot home in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean-style house, north of Sunset Boulevard, was designed by David 
Ross and built by Martin Selko as a spec house for Columbia Residential 
Development. Hughes paid about $6.5 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes sold his Bel-Air home, known as "Liongate," last year to the daughter of 
billionaire entrepreneur Marvin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes had purchased "Liongate" in 1984 from singer Kenny Rogers, who named the 
house for the decorative lions he installed at the front gate. Rogers sold 
"Liongate" to move into "The Knoll," a Beverly Hills landmark he later sold to 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
SIR GORDON WHITE, chairman of the U.S. division of the British conglomerate 
Hanson Trust PLC, is putting more than $3 million into remodeling a new house 
he bought for $7 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
He's adding a guest house and redoing the existing house, which is in Beverly 
Park. That's the posh subdivision overlooking Beverly Hills, but White's house 
is one of the few with no city view, we're told. 
</P>
<P>
White owns homes in London and New York City, but this is his first purchase in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
A Holmby Hills mansion will be the site today of an annual fund-raiser for the 
Culver City-based Los Angeles Coastal Cities Unit of the American Cancer 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
Designed in 1939 by the late architect Paul Williams, the two-story, Colonial 
style mansion, behind gates, is nearly 7,000 square feet in size and has a 
tennis court, 50-foot-long pool, a pool house and a motor court, all on about 
1.6 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The exteriors were used in the 1981 movie "Mommie Dearest," and the entire 
property was used in the '50s film "The Swimmer," starring Burt Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
The house was also used in the final episode of the TV series "Moonlighting," 
and it can be seen on an upcoming segment of the ABC-TV show "20/20." But if 
you can't wait for "20/20" and can afford a $200 donation, you can see it today 
at the garden party. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. and Mrs. Robert Birndorf own the house, which is for sale for $9 million 
and is listed with Joyce Rey and Cecelia Waeschle of Rodeo Realty.

'CASTLE' CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have just read Art Sandford's "King of Castle Frets Royally Over Remodeling" 
(June 11), and I find that the ignorance that many people possess regarding 
sensitive remodeling of an older home is not limited to those who are simply 
sold a bill of goods by an insensitive or greedy contractor. 
</P>
<P>
I looked at the photo of the Sandford's charming Fillmore home and mentally 
compared it to my own 81-year-old home in Highland Park, which happens to be a 
Los Angeles City Historic Cultural Monument. 
</P>
<P>
While I have no problems with the Sandford's desire for more living space and 
certain modern conveniences, such as a shower and central air conditioning, I 
do find fault with the idea of changing the design and character of this house 
with stucco and new (most probably aluminum) windows. A second-story addition 
on this particular house is another item that has to be looked at very carfully 
as to what it will do to the overall feel and architectural integrity of this 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The idea we are looking at now is to dig out the basement area and replace the 
brick foundation with a modern one covered with a brick veneer to match the 
original. This will give us three additional rooms and a third bathroom, as 
well as bringing the house up to modern seismic standards, which is a very 
important factor in Southern California. I hope that the Sandfords might be 
willing to consider this option. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the possibility of adding on to the back of the house, if there 
is room to do so, but any addition should be designed to go with the rest of 
the house, as in shingle siding and wooden windows.

INDUSTRIAL LEASE FORMS AVAILABLE IN 'PLAIN ENGLISH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "plain English" industrial lease form designed to reduce landlord-tenant 
litigation is now available throughout California and can be purchased from 
realty boards or through the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Claman, senior partner of the law firm of Greenberg, Glusker, Fields, 
Claman &amp; Machtinger, authored the leases in cooperation with the Society of 
Industrial and Office Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
"Every provision in the lease forms and riders has been written in concise and 
direct sentences comprehensible to laymen," Claman said. 
</P>
<P>
The new system of leases summarizes all business points on the first page of 
the lease, addresses and resolves issues that often lead to litigation, reduces 
negotiation time and drafting expense, Claman added.

CONDOS FOR 'AFFLUENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the article by David W. Myers "New Downtown Apartments Aimed at 
Affluent" (June 25), foes of this complex have missed an important point of 
having such apartments in the city: to begin to alleviate the horrendous 
commutes and gridlocked freeways that Los Angeles has become famous for. 
</P>
<P>
The reference to "affluent yuppies" is such a tired cliched, and pointless when 
you consider that $1,500 per month is standard for anyone (not just yuppies) to 
pay for rent in most of Los Angeles. Considering the cost of a mortgage these 
days, it doesn't even seem "upscale," it seems average. 
</P>
<P>
For people who need to work downtown or who like the urban life style, such 
apartments and condos will be a welcome relief from life styles of the outlying 
areas. Perhaps a greater variety of places to eat and shop will be drawn to the 
downtown area and L.A.'s heart will become a fun place to live and work, equal 
to towns like Boston and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, whether we like it or not, L.A. will continue to attract record 
numbers of new citizens from colder climes, and they're willing to commute 
downtown from Palmdale, if that's what it takes to live here. Do we want them 
on our freeways, or do we provide affordable housing for them that's closer 
than an hour and a half on the freeway?

CHECKLIST FOR CHOOSING HANDYMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, Collins is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here's some advice from experts for anyone about to hire a handyman: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Plan to avoid surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Plan exactly what you want done, how you want it to look and how much you want 
to spend. Meticulously prepared plans will be helpful for obtaining accurate 
bids. What is not shown on the plans will not be included in the finished 
product -- or in the estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shop around before hiring a handyman. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of places to find qualified handymen. Start with neighbors, 
your insurance agent or a local realtor. Local hardware stores often keep a 
bulletin board for posting business cards of local handymen. The H.O.M.E.S. 
Guild at (800) 647-3337 offers free referrals to tradesmen throughout the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ask for references. 
</P>
<P>
Ask the handyman for a list of jobs he or she has completed recently in your 
area. A skilled worker should be proud of his work and ready to provide the 
information. Among others, the questions you might want to ask those references 
include: Did the handyman stick to the schedule? Did he offer suggestions and 
advice when appropriate? Were you pleased with the work and the way it was 
done? Did the handyman listen to you when you had a problem and help resolve 
it? Did he make any necessary corrections? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Look at samples of the handyman's work. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever possible, visit the handyman's previous work sites to determine 
whether the completed work meets your own standards. This is particularly 
important for cosmetic work, even if the recommendation comes from a next-door 
neighbor, because everyone's standards are different. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Check licensing. 
</P>
<P>
If the work to be done is in excess of $300, a handyman must have a license. 
Call the local Contractors' State License Board to determine if the handyman is 
properly licensed, either as a general contractor or for a particular trade, 
and that the license is in good standing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Set a definite appointment time and determine a way to reconfirm to avoid being 
stood up, which is the biggest complaint coming from both sides of the 
handyman-client relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Payment. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid making final payment for work that has not been completed. It is 
customary for a partial payment to be made before the work is begun if there 
are materials to be purchased for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Saving money. 
</P>
<P>
If materials will be needed, it may be less expensive to purchase small items 
-- smoke alarms, toilet seats, outdoor flood lights -- yourself. If he has to 
buy them for you, the handyman probably will charge a premium to cover his own 
time.

HOME IMPROVEMENT: STEP BY STEP, TECHNIQUES FOR PAINTING OUTDOORS; 
</P>
<P>
FOR YOUR OWN COMFORT AND TO HELP PAINT DRY BETTER, WORK IN THE SHADE IF 
POSSIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By READERS DIGEST, For The Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The warm days of spring and fall are ideal for exterior painting. 
</P>
<P>
Work in the shade if possible. The paint will dry better and you'll be more 
comfortable. Wait for clear, dry weather and let at least two days pass after 
the last rain. 
</P>
<P>
PAINTING SEQUENCE: Begin by laying drop cloths to protect walks, shrubs and 
other areas. Start painting the main parts of the structure first: siding, 
shingles and other large areas. Then do the trim -- windows, doors, cornices 
and so on. Next, paint decks, porches and patios. 
</P>
<P>
Start at the top and work across in horizontal stretches. Paint gables before 
painting the eave lines. Paint dormers before painting lower sections. Use a 
clean drop cloth to protect roofing that's beneath the area you're painting. 
</P>
<P>
SIDING: Clapboard siding should be painted with a brush. Load the brush by 
dipping a third to a half of the bristle length into the paint. Gently tap the 
brush on the can sides to dislodge extra paint. Do not wipe it against the 
can's edge. 
</P>
<P>
Paint the bottom edge of the board, working the paint into the crevice. Next, 
apply paint in short strokes across the face of the siding and spread it with 
smooth, even strokes. Paint an area about 3 feet wide and five boards deep. 
After one section is completed, move to the next one and work from the dry area 
toward the area just painted. If the siding has grooves, paint them first. 
</P>
<P>
Paint vertical siding from top to bottom. On flat surfaces, a roller speeds 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
TRIM: On the eaves, brush a 2-inch paint band to separate them from the siding. 
Then finish them with a roller. Use small brushes, 1 inch to 2 1/2 inches wide 
for other trim. 
</P>
<P>
WINDOWS, DOORS, STAIRS: On windows, paint horizontal dividers, then vertical 
dividers, then the sides of the surrounding wall trim. 
</P>
<P>
On doors, begin with the panels. Then, paint the horizontal and vertical 
boards. Paint across the top of flush doors, and then down. 
</P>
<P>
When painting stairs, paint alternate steps so you can use the steps while the 
paint dries. 
</P>
<P>
SPRAY PAINTING: Paint for spraying must be thinned to spraying consistency and 
strained through a filter to remove lumps and dirt. Spray outdoors on a calm 
day. Protect surroundings from the spray. Adjust the spray pattern to suit the 
surface being painted. Use a narrow fan pattern for small areas and full width 
pattern for large areas such as walls. 
</P>
<P>
Keep the gun about 6 to 8 inches from the surface. Move the gun parallel to the 
work surface and overlap each stroke by one-half. 
</P>
<P>
Clean equipment thoroughly after use. 
</P>

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: A COOL WAY TO REDUCE HEAT IS WINDOW FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I want to install residential window film myself to block the sun's 
heat and stop the fading of my curtains and furniture. What type of window film 
is best so the sun's heat isn't blocked in the winter too? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Installing window film yourself is one of the best methods to control 
the summer sun's heat and glare. It lowers your air-conditioning costs and 
improves your comfort. An added benefit is that it blocks nearly all the 
ultraviolet rays, so it protects your curtains and furniture from fading. 
</P>
<P>
There are many types of window film available and each has its specific 
sun-control characteristics. Generally, the ones that block the most solar heat 
in the summer, also block it in the winter. With proper cleaning, window film 
should last 10 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
There is a special type of residential "insulating" window film that uses a 
low-E (low emissivity) coating. This low-E coating is the same type of coating 
that is used on the new super-energy-efficient thermal replacement windows. 
</P>
<P>
It is as effective at blocking the sun's direct heat as ordinary window film 
and better at blocking reflected heat from patios and walks. 
</P>
<P>
Although insulating film does block some of the sun's heat in the winter, it 
also reduces the heat loss back outdoors. Overall, energy is saved and your 
heating bills are lower too. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you aren't concerned about stopping the summer sun's heat, insulating 
window film is often a good idea. In addition to the winter energy savings and 
stopping fabric fading, it increases the shatter resistance of window glass. 
This is important for children's safety. 
</P>
<P>
Residential insulating window film is available in several degrees of tint. 
After installation, you generally won't even notice the lighter-tinted film on 
your windows. There are also more reflective insulating window films available 
that block even more summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to install insulating window film yourself. Cut the window film with 
scissors about 1 inch larger than the window glass area. Using a spray bottle, 
wet the indoor surface of the window with water. 
</P>
<P>
Peel off the backing, wet film's adhesive surface and place it against the 
glass. Position the film on the glass and squeegee it to force out the excess 
water. Cut the excess film overlap with a razor blade and let it dry. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 331 for a small sample piece 
of low-E insulating window film to try on your window, heat-blocking and 
performance specifications, addresses of manufacturers and do-it-yourself 
instructions and diagrams. Please include $1 and a self-addressed envelope.Fan 
No Replacement for Air Conditioner 
</P>
<P>
Q: I was going to install a whole-house fan in our new home along with central 
air-conditioning. Will installing a whole-house fan reduce the size of the air 
conditioner that I need? 
</P>
<P>
A: A whole-house fan (which draws fresh air from the windows and exhausts it 
through the attic by way of an opening in the ceiling) can reduce your 
air-conditioning costs and make you more comfortable, but it won't reduce the 
size of air conditioner you need. An air conditioner is sized to meet the 
cooling needs for the hottest times of the day when you wouldn't be using your 
whole house fan anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Use the whole-house fan at night and early morning. It will keep the house cool 
well into the late-morning hours. However, during hot and humid weather, you 
may be better off not alternating the use of a whole-house fan and air 
conditioner each day. Too much moisture is absorbed by the house at night and 
your air conditioner may run longer to remove it the next day.

SPECIAL FORMULAS TARGET PESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when everything seems to be going along so well, those pesky garden pests 
show up and begin to consume the bountiful meal in your garden. 
</P>
<P>
You can usually control them in one of several ways: by physically removing 
them, by bringing in other insects that are their natural enemies or by using a 
packaged product containing active ingredients to kill the pest. 
</P>
<P>
Caterpillars, budworms and other critters can be handled very nicely by the use 
of one of the bacillus thuringiensis products. This is not a chemical; rather 
it is a bacteria which, when eaten by the unsuspecting worm, causes one last 
stomach ache. 
</P>
<P>
Ants are also having a field day now. Silica gel compound is a very safe 
product that is neither a chemical nor a germ. It causes an insect's feet to 
stick together -- so it also works on silverfish and other creepy crawlers. 
</P>
<P>

BETTER SKYLIGHTS MAKE INSTALLATION AND UPKEEP EASIER FOR HOMEOWNERS. 
</P>

Skylights: For the past 20 years or so, they have been one of the hottest 
"accessories" to be added to the home. And during that time, the reasons for 
adding them have gotten better and better. 
</P>
<P>
Not many years ago, skylights were "net energy wasters." What they gained in 
terms of free light and wintertime solar heating, they more than lost in terms 
of winter heat loss and unwanted summer heat gain. 
</P>
<P>
To solve that problem, the major makers formed a committee to discover ways to 
improve efficiency. What they found was that most energy loss was taking place 
through highly conductive metal skylight frames, and through air leaks. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take them long to remedy that situation. Improved seals and gaskets 
were the answer to air leaks. To combat conductive losses through the frame, 
some makers switched from metal to vinyl or fiberglass. Others stayed with 
metal, but installed "thermal breaks," insulating barriers of plastic between 
inner and outer shells of the frame. 
</P>
<P>
With those improvements, skylights turned into net energy gainers. And with the 
introduction in the past few years of new energy-efficient glazing systems such 
as Low-E glass and Heat Mirror, energy performance has gone up another notch. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a good skylight can probably pay for itself in energy savings in 15 
years or less, including the price of installation. And some are so easy to 
install that you can do the job yourself, cutting pay-back time even further. 
</P>
<P>
If all this convinces you to put a skylight or two in your home, here are some 
tips and features to look for. 
</P>
<P>
SIZING: As a rule of thumb, a skylight should have an area roughly equal to 
1/23 the area of the room it will serve. If you want extra light -- perhaps for 
a plant room -- you should increase the size. You'll also need a bigger 
skylight if your ceilings are higher than the usual eight feet. 
</P>
<P>
GLAZING: Single- glazed skylights are OK in the West or other regions where the 
climate is mild. But even there, double glazing can help fight excessive heat 
gain. In colder climates, single glazing just doesn't make sense. Here you 
should consider, in order of increasing effectiveness, double glazing, Low-E 
glass, and Heat Mirror systems. What about plastic? There was a time when the 
plastic bubble ruled the roof. But over the years, glass has begun to take 
over, partly because of its flat, crisp look, and partly because of the 
efficiency of the new glass glazing systems. Double-glazed plastic still 
performs well, however, and if you live in the hail belt, plastic's impact 
resistance is a strong selling point. 
</P>
<P>
FEATURES: If you plan to try installing a skylight yourself, you'll want a 
self-curbing design with an easy installation system. Try to get ahold of the 
installation instructions for any skylight you are considering. If you don't 
like what you see, investigate another brand. Some makers such as Wasco 
actually encourage do-it-yourself installation. Others don't. 
</P>
<P>
VENTING OR FIXED? Skylights that open may cost 50% more than fixed types, but 
that can be money well spent in some cases. Located high in the ceiling, an 
open skylight does a good job of venting off hot, stuffy air. I have two 
skylights in my bedroom and opening them both can usually get me through a hot 
summer night without air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Some venting skylights are designed to open so you can clean them from inside 
the house, and this can be a boon if you live in an area with dusty or polluted 
air or heavy bird traffic. If your skylight will be located high in a cathedral 
ceiling, you might want to invest in a motorized opening system, controlled by 
a wall switch. I run my bedroom skylights by hand with a long extension crank. 
It's not particularly easy to handle. 
</P>
<P>
SHADES: At certain times of the day or year, a skylight can let in too much 
light. For those occasions, a shade is the answer. Most makers offer them as 
options. I put a light tan roll-up shade on the skylight in my dressing room. I 
still get lots of light, but I keep direct sun off the clothes in the open 
closets, and that helps prevent fading. If you want to block off light almost 
completely, a shade in a dark, opaque color will do the trick.

GRAND OPENING FOR ONE CIVIC PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One Civic Plaza, a six-story office tower that combines with the new 
eight-story Ibis-Carson Hotel to create the focal point of the city of Carson's 
new civic center complex, will hold its grand opening on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
The $25-million development of Muller Co. of Irvine, with some 40% of its space 
already leased, is described as "the first quality mid-rise office structure in 
the city of Carson" and is an integral part of a master-planned, mixed-use site 
to be known as Civic Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The site will include a free-standing restaurant, a convention center and 
retail facilities, in addition to the 224-room Ibis Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The 120,000-square-foot tower is situated across from the existing 
70,000-square-foot Carson Community Center and close to Carson City Hall. Its 
northerly border is adjacent to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The project features a reflective blue-glass and white-band exterior and was 
designed by Gilbert Aja Associates of Irvine. The builder was Oltmans 
Construction Co. of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
An entry drive to the building traverses a palm-lined Civic Plaza drive and 
leads to a landscaped motor court with 10 38-foot palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
The floor plan, with each 22,000-square-foot level providing up to 14 corner 
offices, can accommodate tenants requiring from 1,000 to 60,000 square feet. 
Other building features include on-site security guards and monitoring 
services, card-key access and four parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of 
building space. 
</P>
<P>
The Seeley Co.'s Torrance and Los Angeles offices are exclusive leasing agents. 
Tenants include Rancho Dominguez Bank on the tower's ground floor, U.S. Bancorp 
and Allied Industrial Distributors.

A SUBURBAN WAR OF REVENGE; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS ATTRIBUTE 10 DEATHS TO WAVE OF GANG VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 19, 1988, two men on a motorcycle rode past Marvin (Flash) McFee, an 
Altadena gang member and drug dealer, fired a bullet into his chest, and 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
It was, as murders go, a humdrum affair that a local newspaper described in a 
few sentences: "A 22-year-old man died in an apparent gang-related drive-by 
shooting outside an Altadena residence Sunday night. The victim was 
unidentified. Circumstances of the shooting were not detailed." 
</P>
<P>
But McFee's murder was far more significant than anyone suspected. 
</P>
<P>
Altadena sheriff's deputies now believe it sparked a war of revenge between 
black gangs which has brought a wave of violence to Pasadena and Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
Since the death of McFee, who was a member of the Altadena Block Crips, at 
least 10 people have been killed in shootings that have bounced back and forth 
between Pasadena, the stronghold of the Bloods, and Altadena, turf of the 
Crips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
225 Died Last Year 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of deaths pales in comparison to the 255 who died last year 
in gang-related homicides in Los Angeles, it marks a turning point for these 
two suburban communities. 
</P>
<P>
What was once a sporadically violent standoff on the fringes of the gang war in 
Los Angeles, has become a war of its own. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no such thing as a fistfight anymore," said Pasadena Police Officer 
James Deal Jr., a member of the department's four-man gang unit. "The way I see 
it, they're playing for keeps." 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, the fight has become more violent in the past two months than 
ever before. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a group of gang members tossed a Molotov cocktail through the 
window of a house on West Palm Drive in Altadena. Nine people escaped the fire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Died a Week Later 
</P>
<P>
Cennie Brown Earby, 34, was trapped in her bedroom. She was burned on more than 
90% of her body and died in a hospital a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe the intended victims were Kelvin Turrentine, who they 
suspect is a Crip member and who was shot in the buttocks a few days after 
McFee's death last year, and Wallace Brown Jr., another suspected Crip member. 
</P>
<P>
Since the firebombing, at least seven others have been wounded in drive-by 
shootings in Pasadena and Altadena. Another Altadena house was firebombed a 
week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what you call retaliation," said one man as he huddled with some 
friends at the King's Village housing complex in the heart of the Pasadena's 
Bloods territory. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, it was like this," he said, shadow boxing with the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's like this." He formed his fingers into the shape of a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
County Sheriff's Deputy Steve Underdown strapped on a flak jacket and, armed 
with a couple packs of cigars and a .357-caliber pistol, headed off for a 
patrol in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
For the last year and a half, Underdown has been a member a four-man team that 
as part of its duties monitors gang activities in the Altadena area. 
</P>
<P>
During his tour of duty, the streets have taken a definite turn for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where McFee was shot," he said as he guided his unmarked patrol car 
past a house on Calaveras Street. 
</P>
<P>
His partner, Joseph Key, turned a spotlight on the house across the street. 
"The record for most shot up," Key said. "Fifteen reported." 
</P>
<P>
The house is for sale, as are two others within a few dozen yards. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Key and Underdown's tour of the streets would have been a short 
affair, a few stops here and there, mostly at the homes of drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
This night, it takes hours. On some streets, the names of victims blur together 
as the unmarked patrol car cruises past. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number and severity of gang-related attacks has come with 
startling speed, Underdown said. 
</P>
<P>
He chuckled when he reminisced about more peaceful days, when four years ago, 
Bloods and Crips faced off in a tackle football game at Charles White Park. 
Parents served hot dogs, deputies walked the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
As he drives past the park, Underdown points to a spot nearby: "This is where 
Kelvin Turrentine got it." 
</P>
<P>
The teams in this new game between Bloods and Crips have been developing for 
the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Police Sgt. Monte Yancey said there are two dominant factions of 
Bloods in the city: the Pasadena Denver Lane Bloods, who claim the northwestern 
quarter of Pasadena, and the Squiggly Lane Bloods, who largely operate in the 
border areas between northwest Pasadena and southwest Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the Denver Lane Bloods are related to a "set" in South-Central 
Los Angeles that goes by the same name. The Pasadena group also goes by the 
name Devil's Lane Bloods. Why this set, one of 36 in Los Angeles, migrated 
north is unknown to police. 
</P>
<P>
Altadena is claimed by the Altadena Block Crips, who mainly operate on the west 
side of the community. There is also a small group of Crips based near the 
northern border of Pasadena, named the Raymond Avenue Crips. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials estimate there are about 300 Bloods and 200 Crips in 
both cities, although the violent core of "old gangsters" may number just a few 
dozen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bloods Are Dominant 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the conflict in Los Angeles, the Bloods are the dominant group in this 
suburban dispute. Pasadena, in fact, is one of the few cities in the county 
that is identified as a Blood stronghold, law enforcement officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Turley, a member of the Community Youth Gang Services Project, a gang 
intervention and mediation group funded by the county and the city of Los 
Angeles, said Altadena and Pasadena were largely Crip territory in the early 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But he believes the balance of power began to shift in the early 1980s. 
Underdown said the beginning of crack cocaine sales on the street in the 
mid-1980s also exacerbated the conflict, not only bringing gang members out 
into the open, but also sparking turf wars over drug territory. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was out on the street," Underdown said. "It didn't take long for 
things to get bad." 
</P>
<P>
There were a few shootings in Pasadena and Altadena that came with the crack 
cocaine trade, but McFee's death sparked a back-and-forth style of attack that 
no one had seen before. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shot Up a House 
</P>
<P>
Two days after McFee's shooting, a pair of suspected Bloods were wounded near 
Summit Avenue and Claremont Street in Pasadena. The next day, a carload of 
gunmen shot up a house on Thurin Avenue in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, six apartments were shot up at the King's Villages apartments 
in Pasadena. The next day, Kelvin Turrentine was wounded in a drive-by shooting 
near Altadena's Charles White Park. 
</P>
<P>
In this hazy world of revenge, police often can only guess whether attacks are 
related to drugs, gangs, personal fights or none of the above. 
</P>
<P>
But as some gang members say, the reasons no longer matter. "We just don't get 
along," said one youth recently as he stood on the street in front of King's 
Villages with a red baseball hat on his head, the symbol of a Blood. 
</P>
<P>
The animosity has reached a peak this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks, Underdown believes, started with a traffic accident June 10. That 
day, he said, suspected Blood member Damion Thomas was run off the road in 
Pasadena by a gray Hyundai sedan that had been identified in previous drive-by 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was riding a motorcycle, which burst into flames when he crashed. Thomas 
suffered third-degree burns on his arms, legs and face. He has since been 
released from a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drive-By Shooting 
</P>
<P>
For the next two weeks, there were shootings in Pasadena and Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
The first to die was Rickey Rivers, 28, who was shot June 26 on the 2200 block 
of Casitas Avenue in Altadena. Investigators are not certain Rivers' death was 
gang related. 
</P>
<P>
Paxton Valentine III, a 19-year-old known Blood member, was killed in a 
drive-by shooting on Casitas Avenue in Altadena the next day. A suspect later 
told sheriff's deputies that Valentine was killed "so Flash can rest easy." 
</P>
<P>
The house on West Palm Street was firebombed three days later. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings over the past year have left in their wake contradictory 
perceptions about the violence, ranging from comfortable ignorance to a 
hardened acceptance of the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
The suburban gang conflict jumps from block to block, covering residential 
neighborhoods where startling events like a firebombing on one street can go 
unnoticed three streets over. 
</P>
<P>
Two blocks away from the firebombed house on West Palm, resident Michael 
Jackson didn't hear the sirens that night. He knows there are drug emporiums 
nearby, but in his ethnically mixed neighborhood, he guesses there are many 
neighbors who don't. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Situation Has Improved 
</P>
<P>
At the King's Villages housing complex, which police squad cars patrol at least 
a few dozen times a night, some residents say the gang situation has actually 
improved over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a difference," said one 65-year-old resident. "Last year, it was so 
bad the police wouldn't come here. Now I can come out and feel safer." 
</P>
<P>
But she still doesn't want her name published. "I don't hear anything," she 
said. "Don't use my name. I've got to live here." 
</P>
<P>
Others agree with police that the situation has grown more violent. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of King's Villages said her niece was shot a few months ago by 
gunmen who mistook her for a rival gang member. "Just about everybody knows 
someone who has been shot," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, her apartment was hit by shotgun fire. It sounded like someone 
throwing gravel against the wall, but she knew it was shotgun pellets. "You can 
tell the difference," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrested More Than 100 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, deputies in Altadena have arrested more than 100 people in 
sweeps that involve stopping known gang members and, sometimes, youths who just 
seem suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
Underdown said the theory is, if they can confiscate a few guns or temporarily 
take a few people off the streets, the conflict has a chance to die down. 
</P>
<P>
But the sweeps also have thrown a disconcerting component into the already 
jittery neighborhoods of Altadena and northwest Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
While police officers usually recognize the people they stop, sometimes they 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just standing here with my girlfriend," said 19-year-old Anthony Dion Mann 
after Pasadena Police Officers Derrick Carter and James Deal Jr. stopped to 
question him. "I'm a decent human being." 
</P>
<P>
Mann had not been doing anything unusual, but Carter and Deal thought they 
recognized him. They explain it's their job to keep a close watch on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Target of a Drive-By 
</P>
<P>
In a few minutes, several adults come out of the apartment building next to the 
parking lot Mann is standing in. "It's not right," one man told the officers. 
"They're not doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
Deal and Carter try to explain again, but eventually decide to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"They do it to me all the time," Mann said, glaring at the two officers as they 
walk away. 
</P>
<P>
The officers received a warmer reception when they stopped to talk with a 
16-year-old they have talked with many times about drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was the target of a drive-by shooting a few days after the Altadena 
house was firebombed. 
</P>
<P>
"You're lucky," Deal said to the boy. 
</P>
<P>
He asks him whether he knows who did the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The boy shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
Does he know why he was shot? 
</P>
<P>
He shakes his head again. 
</P>
<P>
"He crept up and started shooting," the boy said. 
</P>
<P>
The first bullet caught him in the leg, cracking a bone in two. He hobbles 
around the sidewalk on crutches. A bright red pair of warm-up pants covers a 
long leg cast. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always like this in the summer," the boy said.

JUDAISM PERVADES WRITER'S LIFE AND HER PLOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Faye Kellerman was little, she used to climb into the apricot tree in her 
Sherman Oaks back yard and fantasize, sometimes speaking lines from her 
daydreams out loud. "Is this child normal?" her grandmother would fret. 
</P>
<P>
Now 37, Kellerman climbs into the office studio above her bedroom and 
fantasizes still. She figured out long ago that "if I can put it down on paper 
then I'm a writer, not a weirdo." 
</P>
<P>
Kellerman, who lives in Beverlywood, recently published her third and most 
ambitious novel, a 600-page mystery set in Elizabethan England titled "The 
Quality of Mercy." 
</P>
<P>
Like her earlier, contemporary mysteries, "The Ritual Bath" and "Sacred and 
Profane," the new novel features a pair of seriously star-crossed lovers. 
Rebecca Lopez, the exotic protagonist of "The Quality of Mercy," is a conversa, 
a secret Jew posing as an Anglican in Elizabethan England, where Judaism was 
outlawed from 1290 until Oliver Cromwell lifted the ban in 1656. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Imaginative Account 
</P>
<P>
Cursed with a good mind in a bad century for women, Lopez falls in love with a 
silver-tongued playwright named William Shakespeare, who is neither Jewish nor 
single. The rest is historical suspense fiction, including a highly imaginative 
account of how Shakespeare came to write "The Merchant of Venice." 
</P>
<P>
Kellerman will sign copies of "The Quality of Mercy," published by William 
Morrow &amp; Co., on July 20 at Vagabond Books in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Although much of "The Quality of Mercy" is fanciful, it is grounded in 
Kellerman's considerable knowledge of a great many subjects. "I write about 
what I know," Kellerman said, and, as the author's blurb on one of her books 
indicates, that covers a lot of territory. She "is not only a gifted 
storyteller but a dentist, an expert fencer, a musician who plays four 
instruments, a guitar maker -- and the mother of three young children." 
</P>
<P>
She is also the wife of psychologist-turned-mystery writer Jonathan Kellerman, 
who works at his own word processor in another part of their sprawling Westside 
home. Her husband is her favorite mystery writer, Kellerman said unhesitantly, 
and the couple regularly critique each other's work. "It took many years to 
learn how to do that without having a cold night," she noted. 
</P>
<P>
Kellerman sought training in dentistry because "I thought it would be a good 
profession to practice. It still may be. I don't know." Although she has done 
only volunteer work as a dentist, she considers it excellent preparation for 
her career as a mystery writer. "I have a very good knowledge of anatomy and 
forensics." In "Sacred and Profane," a forensic dentist helps solve a murder by 
tipping the police to the likelihood that the victim was deaf -- a deduction 
she makes from the condition of the dead woman's teeth. 
</P>
<P>
What the publisher's blurb fails to mention is Kellerman's knowledge and love 
of Orthodox Judaism, which pervades her daily life. The Kellermans live where 
they do, in part, so they can walk to their temple on the Sabbath. Her ketubah 
-- her marriage contract, beautifully hand-lettered in Hebrew -- hangs in a 
place of honor over the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
The realities of observant Jewish life also inform her novels. Rina Lazarus, 
the heroine of Kellerman's modern mysteries, packs kosher brown-bag lunches of 
salmon and noodle kugel for the man she loves -- big, red-headed police 
detective Peter Decker. But her religious values don't allow her to entertain 
him overnight without benefit of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the Orthodox Jewish world was a very interesting one that had not 
been portrayed accurately in the medium," Kellerman said. She fact-checks all 
matters of Halakha, or Jewish law, with Orthodox rabbis, but her meticulousness 
has not exempted her from criticism from some parts of the Jewish community. 
She has been chided for setting a scene of sexual violence at an Orthodox 
ritual bath. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, she said, she gets fan mail from young Orthodox women who 
say they identify with feisty Rina Lazarus. 
</P>
<P>
Kellerman likes Rina, too, but she emphasizes that she is not Rina or any of 
her other characters. Rina might not approve of the fact that Kellerman, though 
married, does not cover her cascade of brown curls, as Orthodox women 
traditionally do. "I admire her," Kellerman said, "but I'm not going to cover 
my hair just because she does." 
</P>
<P>
Fiction gives Kellerman the opportunity to explore alternative lives, if only 
in her mind. "It's fun writing because you put yourself into other worlds," she 
said. Kellerman says she has no trouble getting inside the skin of Decker, the 
Los Angeles police detective, raised a Baptist, who is so unlike his creator. 
</P>
<P>
"I can feel what he's like," she said. "There's a very masculine side to me. 
Maybe that's why I took all those math and science courses." 
</P>
<P>
Kellerman also attributes some of Decker's authenticity to the hours she spent 
with her brothers, and to a good ear. "I listen to people," she said. "I'm a 
big eavesdropper." 
</P>
<P>
Kellerman has finished two more books featuring Decker and Lazarus, "Milk and 
Honey," to be published next year, and "Day of Atonement," scheduled for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demanding Project 
</P>
<P>
"The Quality of Mercy" was a far more demanding project than a modern mystery, 
Kellerman said, because of the extensive research involved. 
</P>
<P>
Her initial idea for the book, about three years ago, was to have Shakespeare 
and Shylock from "The Merchant of Venice" solve a crime. Later, she came upon 
an account of the life and death of Roderigo Lopez, (the father of her 
heroine), the physician to Queen Elizabeth, a converso who was executed for 
treason at the instigation of the Earl of Essex. 
</P>
<P>
Kellerman's book is both a mystery and a fictional account of what happened to 
Lopez. It is a work of the imagination -- it includes, for instance, a scene in 
which Queen Elizabeth takes the heroine to bed ("I figured, 'What the hey,' " 
Kellerman said, "this is fiction"). But every word, every detail, had to be 
grounded in fact. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy, the author said. She learned that the Elizabethans didn't eat 
tomatoes -- they believed they were poisonous -- that an improperly doffed hat 
was deemed an insult, and that the word incontinently meant "immediately" to 
Shakespeare and his contemporaries. She studied Elizabethan history, culture, 
medicine, cooking. 
</P>
<P>
She also learned as much as possible about "The Merchant of Venice." She found, 
though, that she could not read the plays and poems of Shakespeare while she 
was trying to write about him. "To put words into his mouth was terribly 
intimidating," she recalled, and his body of work "showed too much of the 
genius and not enough of the human being." 
</P>
<P>
She decided not to have her fictional Shakespeare quote real Shakespearean 
lines, as some other writers have done. "He can't talk like a poet all of the 
time," she said. "Sometimes you yell at your spouse, and you don't do it in 
verse!" 
</P>
<P>
Writing "The Quality of Mercy," Kellerman said, left her with the conviction 
that crime doesn't change and that she was "really glad to be living in the 
20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
Shuddering at the thought of both Elizabethan sanitation and anti-Semitism, she 
said: "You can keep your courtly behavior, just give me my microwave. Good 
title for a country-Western song, nu?"

DEVELOPERS JOIN EFFORTS TO LAUNCH JOBS PROGRAM 
</P>

<P>
In an effort to channel some of the benefits of a proposed 272-home development 
to local residents, developers have teamed up with a community college and two 
social-service agencies to design a construction-trades training and placement 
program that will be launched this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The joint effort will direct local youth toward the building industry by 
training participants at Pasadena City College and matching both skilled and 
non-skilled workers to contractors throughout the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell/Anderson Inc. of Pasadena and Southwest Diversified Inc. of Newport 
Beach are planning to build homes on about 40 acres of the 220-acre site known 
as the La Vina property at the northern tip of Lincoln Avenue. Most of the land 
lies within the Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The development was approved May 3 by the county Regional Planning Commission. 
The Board of Supervisors, which has yet to schedule a hearing, must approve the 
project before construction can begin. 
</P>
<P>
The Urban League, based in Pasadena, will handle recruitment for the program. 
The group will refer area residents interested in non-skilled jobs to Foothill 
Area Community Services Inc., or FACS, another Pasadena-based nonprofit agency. 
FACS will evaluate and match unskilled workers with area subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
Those people interested in learning skilled trades will attend Pasadena City 
College for a semester and receive a certificate after they complete courses. 
They too will be placed through FACS. 
</P>
<P>
At least 100 Altadenans have already signed up for the job program, said Andrew 
Oliver, a spokesman for the developers. The developers are providing seed money 
for the program and will help the participating agencies seek more funding. 
</P>
<P>
James Crayton, associate dean of the college's Community Skills Center, said 
four new classes will be offered in September. The free 18-week courses include 
landscaping, plumbing, telephone installation and security guard training. 
Crayton said he expects the classes to fill up quickly because of the virtual 
guarantee of employment upon completion of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Cantwell, president of Cantwell/Anderson, said he has requested that 
classes in carpentry and electrical and concrete work be added as more recruits 
are enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothill Area Community Services agency is setting up a data bank with 
names of workers and contractors to help with placement, said Ross Lee, the 
agency's human resources director. 
</P>
<P>
"(Construction) is a continuing source of employment," he said. "We will be an 
ongoing center where people can come for referrals." 
</P>
<P>
The organization is applying for about $165,000 in county funds for the first 
three years of the program, Lee said, adding that he expects to place 300 
construction workers the first year. 
</P>
<P>
The Urban League, which will assess participants' experience and help them 
decide what trade to pursue, is still working out its program budget. 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell said he is excited by how the program evolved from residents' concerns 
about how the $100-million project would benefit the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, though, the developer had doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first started thinking about it we thought, 'Omigosh, would it be a 
long bureaucratic task that would just burden the development with 
inefficiencies and slowdowns?' " But he is confident the plan will work because 
of the constant demand for construction workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're committed to putting the trade people together with the awarded 
subcontractors," he said. "We felt it was not only a socially responsible thing 
to do but would make good business sense." 
</P>
<P>
Although the ultimate decision on who is hired will be made by the 50 
subcontractors working on La Vina, the contractors will be very eager to have a 
ready pool of employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In each trade we're talking about (needing) very large numbers," he said. The 
development is scheduled for completion in five years, but employees might be 
retained to install swimming pools or gazebos and to landscape the 35 acres of 
common space. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the La Vina contractors, recruits in the program will be matched 
with contractors throughout the San Gabriel Valley who need workers, said 
Oliver, who will coordinate the program. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Stewart, president of the Altadena chapter of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, had pressed the developers to start an equal 
opportunity program. She argued that residents of the predominantly black and 
economically depressed Lincoln Avenue neighborhood two blocks south of the 
project should be compensated for the additional traffic it would generate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's terrific," Stewart said of the plan. "It's going to be a boost 
for the community. Once you get training for work, no one can take that away 
from you." 
</P>
<P>
A homeowners group, Friends of La Vina, is not as happy about the proposal. The 
group has complained that the density of the project and the increased traffic 
it will create would disrupt the wildlife and semi-rural nature of the hillside 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"(The developers) are trying to buy support from the community," said Friends 
leader Adolfo Miralles. Although only about three dozen group members attend 
meetings regularly, Friends has more than 1,000 supporters, he said. "What 
they're doing (about the job training) is a very commendable thing, but it does 
not change the merit of the project one iota." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Shackleford, an Altadena contractor, had apprehensions about the 
development. "I was concerned they were just going to come in here, take the 
local resources and impact our community and not put anything back," he said. 
But now, Shackleford said, he is convinced that the developers are sincere 
about helping the community.

VICTORY FOR LIBRARY AND CITIZENS, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Friends of the Library of Monterey Park are justifiably elated with the 
Appellate Court's decision to reinstate the Board of Library Trustees which was 
abolished by the Monterey Park City Council. 
</P>
<P>
This is not only a victory for the Friends and the people of Monterey Park with 
its tradition dating back to 1929 of a management board, but a 
precedent-setting case as well. There has never before been a California court 
ruling that libraries should be overseen by an independent board and that city 
officials cannot legally disband the board. This decision affects libraries 
throughout the state of California and is also of nationwide interest. 
</P>
<P>
While (the council majority) considered the funding requirements of the Library 
Municipal Act archaic, the facts are that the council exercises final budget 
approval and it even has the much coveted line-item veto. How much more control 
does the council need? So all we can conclude is that the members wanted 
absolute control. But such control . . . politicizes the library to the 
detriment of the community. Even George Washington feared the absolute control 
of kings! 
</P>
<P>
The Friends are committed to preserving the library as a center to supplement 
the formal system of free public education and as a source of information and 
inspiration to persons of all ages, cultural backgrounds and economic status.

MALIBU COLONY REBUFFED IN EFFORT TO LIMIT SHOPPING CENTER'S HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SPENCER S. HSU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission has rebuffed residents of the Malibu Colony 
in their efforts to shorten the business hours of Malibu's largest shopping 
center, located just across the street from the wealthy seaside enclave. 
Representatives of a homeowners group, whose members include actors Larry 
Hagman, Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith, argued before the commission Thursday 
that the center's builder, Reco Development Corp., is violating a 1987 
agreement limiting hours. Tenants of the center, Malibu Colony Plaza, include a 
24-hour Hughes supermarket and a soon-to-open restaurant to be operated by 
celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the residents' complaints about noise, parking and security, the 
commission voted to accept changes sought by Reco in the 1987 agreement. That 
agreement, reached after lengthy negotiations with the residents, included 
concessions by Reco aimed at preserving the neighborhood's character by 
providing landscaping and shielding the Colony from public access, in addition 
to limiting the center's operating hours. The homeowners group, which includes 
about 35 owners of million-dollar properties along Malibu Road, sought midnight 
closing times for Puck's restaurant and for the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal Expected 
</P>
<P>
The commission's vote means that the supermarket will be allowed to stay open 
around the clock and the restaurant until 2 a.m. A spokesman for the homeowners 
group, the Old Road Committee, said it would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Meredith and several other residents attended the session Thursday to 
help plead their case. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked, and I also feel very badly because it's my home, where I live," 
said Meredith, 79, when it became clear that the vote would go against them. 
</P>
<P>
Puck also attended the hearing, accompanied by his wife, Barbara Lazaroff, and 
both insisted that their restaurant would not cause any trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't run a bar; we run a restaurant," Lazaroff said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be friends with the neighbors," Puck added, "because they are all 
rich (and) they will be our customers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiations Disputed 
</P>
<P>
Roy Crummer, the owner of Reco until he sold the company last month, said he 
had negotiated Hughes' hours before the 1987 agreement with the homeowners 
group. The homeowners disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
In voting 7 to 2 to accept the changes sought by Reco in its building permit, 
the commission appeared to accept the conclusion of its staff that restricting 
the center's hours was not within its jurisdiction -- even though several 
members of the commission acknowledged that they thought Reco was reneging on 
earlier promises. 
</P>
<P>
But homeowners' attorney Joel Klevens said the commission acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very disappointed that the commission did not see fit to enforce its own 
conditions and that it instead sought to undermine the process of negotiation 
and compromise it had endorsed less than two years ago," Klevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the $12-million, 100,000-square-foot shopping center was completed this 
spring. Adorned with a mission-tile roof, carved stone columns imported from 
Mexico, semicircular brick arches and two fountains, landscaped with palm trees 
and bird-of-paradise plants, the center has drawn general praise even from its 
opponents.

ABSENTEE OWNERS, NEGLECTED HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sad change is rapidly spreading throughout my hometown of Arcadia, a "City of 
Homes." 
</P>
<P>
I'm not referring to the ostentatious, overbuilt, $1 million-plus houses that 
have been popping up here like giant, gaudy mushrooms, but to the increasing 
number of vacant, uncared-for homes that have evidently been bought for 
speculation by absentee owners. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these are obviously cared for: plants watered, lawns mowed and papers 
picked up. Many others are left to decay, month after month, while papers pile 
up, lawns and even trees die, and waist-high weeds take over otherwise withered 
yards. These eyesores can be found on street after street, looking worse and 
worse as the months pass and the weeds grow. 
</P>
<P>
Is our city alone with this blight? Why aren't these absentee owners made to 
tidy up . . . and keep up? 
</P>
<P>
Seems we've gone from being a gracious "City of Homes" to a growing "Ghetto of 
Vacant Houses."

SCHOOL CLOSING LEAVES A VOID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young is a man of his word. He told me and other 
representatives of the Friends of Fernald, in response to our entreaties to him 
to reverse his February, 1986, decision to close the Fernald School, that if he 
did not go forward with his decision to close the Fernald School, he could not 
at a later time close the Corinne E. Seeds University Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Young is also a good student. He has learned from his Fernald 
battle. The Friends of Fernald asked him to move the Fernald School to another 
location, rather than to close it; but he insisted on sticking to his decision 
to close the Fernald School. However, even though he won the war, the scars he 
bears from the battles have led him to adopt a different strategy with respect 
to UES. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than follow his original plan of closing UES, he proposes to move it, an 
alternative he denied to the Fernald School. The demise of the Fernald School 
has left an unfilled void in the community's ability to service the needs of 
children with learning disabilities. If UES is to be moved, UCLA should revive 
the Fernald School and move it also.

DISTRICT CALLED INSENSITIVE OVER ITS HANDLING OF MEDICAL CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rejecting claims for medical-bill reimbursement by several students who became 
ill at a school-sponsored concert in April, the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified 
School District board has forwarded the claims to the district's insurance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said denying the claims is a routine step before turning 
them over to the insurance administrator, but parents nevertheless called the 
board unsympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen students singing at the district's "Stairway of the Stars" performance 
April 13 at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium experienced dizziness, nausea, 
headaches and fainting after complaining of smelling strange odors. The 
audience of 2,550 was evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica fire officials were unable to find evidence of fumes or toxic 
substances and speculated that the cause was mass hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
Mass hysteria, which doctors prefer to call "group conversion reaction," is a 
type of psychosomatic symptom that generally occurs in high-stress situations 
within a tight-knit group, according to Dr. Michael Propper, a resident in 
psychiatry at the UCLA Center for Health Services at Veterans Administration 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8 Filed Claims 
</P>
<P>
Eight students filed claims, ranging from $388 to $1,285, against the school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The school board denied that it was insensitive to the students' claims. The 
board last week asked for immediate feedback from the insurance company before 
the company makes a final decision is made on the claims, said board member 
Della Barrett. Usually the board is not involved in the review of claims and 
receives only a periodic summary of the insurance company's decision on claims, 
Barrett and other district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, we're real concerned about the children and their families. . . 
. We're concerned about something happening during a school-sponsored event, 
and I want to make sure the right thing is done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Pearson, the district's director of pupil and administrator services, 
said letters were sent to parents, offering assistance in filing claims. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Taub, who submitted a claim for $1,285 for her 11-year-old daughter's 
ambulance, emergency room and doctor's bills, said last week that she has not 
received any letters from school district officials. She said she is "disturbed 
at the apparent lack of caring on (the school board's) part." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adults Also Affected 
</P>
<P>
Taub also said the mass-hysteria theory was nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
"There were adults also affected. I received medical treatment, and I'm not an 
adolescent and I am not given to hysteria." She said she and her daughter, 
Vanessa, had sore throats and shortness of breath. Vanessa said the auditorium 
smelled like a "mix of gas and paint" and that she fainted right after she was 
taken outside. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Santa Monica in June rejected claims for five students' medical 
bills, said Chuck Cota, liability claims supervisor for the city. "We didn't 
see any basis for any liability. . . . We investigated it, and the Fire 
Department was out there. We couldn't find the source of any toxic-fume 
escape." 
</P>
<P>
The students can pursue their claims against the city by filing lawsuits within 
six months of when the claims were denied, Cota said. No lawsuits had been 
filed as of last week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UCLA and Los Angeles County Department of Health Services 
researchers, who have sent a questionnaire to several hundred students who were 
at the Civic Auditorium, have not determined a cause for the symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of a group effect has to be considered, because the people 
that were affected primarily were in a specific area" of the auditorium and 
were stricken in rapid succession, said Dr. Michael Propper, a resident in 
psychiatry at the UCLA Center for Health Services at Veterans Administration 
Medical Center. "But the other side is that we haven't interviewed any of the 
people yet."

At least 112 anti-abortion protesters affiliated with Operation Rescue were 
arrested by Baltimore County police as they challenged a new state law barring 
the blocking of entrances to medical facilities. Police estimated a crowd of at 
least 400 people on both sides of the abortion issue gathered for a 
demonstration and counterdemonstration in front of the Baltimore Women's 
Medical Center. Anti-abortion forces view the Maryland law against blocking 
medical facilities, passed at the last General Assembly session, as vague and 
unconstitutional. It provides for a $1,000 fine and a prison term of up to a 
year for offenders.

Gunfire was reported in Somalia's capital of Mogadishu, but diplomats said the 
city appeared generally calm one day after clashes between religious worshipers 
and security forces left 23 people dead and 59 wounded. Police said the 
violence erupted when religious demonstrators attacked security forces. But 
witnesses said it appeared troops opened fire as Muslim worshipers left their 
place of prayer.

Police said the murder of a Hells Angels leader in a bloody barroom brawl in 
San Leandro last month may have been part of a power struggle between the 
motorcycle clan and an Aryan Brotherhood prison gang. Michael (Irish) 
O'Farrell, known to authorities as the No. 2 man in the Hells Angels, died in 
the bar fight on June 6. Aaron (Jerry) Marsh has been arrested in connection 
with the murder. Police said Marsh, identified as a member of the white 
supremacist-oriented Aryan Brotherhood, may have killed O'Farrell to gain 
status within his own organization. O'Farrell was repeatedly stabbed and shot.

A Sacramento disc jockey accused of making anti-gay jokes on the air has 
apologized after being reprimanded by his bosses. Pat Garrett of radio station 
KWOD offended many homosexuals last month when he complained that his 
girlfriend had left him for a man named Bruce, who was probably "a limp-wristed 
queer" or "faggot." Calling the remarks "verbal gay bashing," gay leaders 
gathered 350 signatures on a petition calling for a boycott of the station and 
its advertisers. The station's management agreed to publish an apology in the 
gay media and to establish a policy prohibiting anti-gay remarks on the air.

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said it will swap its 22% stake in 
Italian computer maker Olivetti for a large holding in Carlo de Benedetti's 
main industrial holding company. The announcement ends speculation that 
AT&amp;T would sell its Olivetti stake because of differences that emerged a 
year ago over the firms' industrial alliance formed in December, 1983. Under 
the new agreement, AT&amp;T is selling to De Benedetti's Italian holding firm 
Compagnie Industriali Riunite 100 million Olivetti shares at a price of $8.31 
each, for a total of $832 million. Then, AT&amp;T will buy 182.5 million CIR 
shares, also to total $832 million.

Thunderstorms soaked much of the nation's midsection and portions of the West. 
There was flooding in northern Texas, where the storms dropped five inches of 
rain in Lucas and covered Highway 69 near Greenville with three feet of water. 
Winds gusted up to 50 m.p.h. in Barton County in central Kansas. More than two 
inches of rain fell in an hour at Kansas City International Airport. The 
mercury in Upper Michigan dropped to a record low of 36 degrees in Marquette. 
In the West, an area of low pressure extended from the desert Southwest across 
Nevada to Idaho. Unstable air produced thunderstorms across portions of eastern 
Washington, Idaho, Montana and across the New Mexico and Colorado Rockies.

About 30 East Germans have taken refuge in West Germany's embassy in Budapest, 
Hungary, hoping to win admission to the West, the West German newspaper Bild am 
Sonntag said. It quoted a Bonn official as saying many East Germans had been 
drawn to Hungary after it began dismantling its border fence with Austria in 
May, leading them to believe they could make their way to West Germany via 
Hungary. But Hungarian border patrols were turning back East Germans, the paper 
said. News of this had caused would-be emigrants to take refuge in the embassy 
in the hope that it would find a way out for them.

The state of Alaska wants Exxon to continue cleaning up its spilled oil during 
the long northern winter and to resume cleanup operations in spring, according 
to letters from state officials to the Coast Guard. Exxon wants to pull out of 
Alaska in two months, on Sept. 15, according to plans submitted to the Coast 
Guard, and a company official said that Exxon was going ahead with 
demobilization plans. The state wants containment booms maintained at salmon 
hatcheries and sensitive bays in Prince William Sound, where the Exxon Valdez 
spilled about 11 million gallons March 24. State officials also want Exxon to 
collect oily debris and continue shoreline cleanup, especially at heavily oiled 
beaches, as long as weather permits.

Nicaragua's social development is on "the verge of disintegration" and Western 
powers should increase aid to the struggling Central American nation, Oxfam, a 
private British philanthropic agency, said. "The United States' embargo on 
trade with Nicaragua and unstable commodity prices have combined to cause 
economic collapse," Oxfam said in a publication marking the agency's 25 years 
of work in Nicaragua. Oxfam said it is appealing to the 12 Common Market 
nations to support peace moves in Nicaragua and to promote the disbanding and 
resettlement of the U.S.-backed Contras.

A soldier in Sri Lanka mistook Indian peacekeeping troops for rebels and opened 
fire, sparking a gun battle that left at least two Sri Lankan soldiers and two 
Indian soldiers dead and wounded at least five others, an Indian government 
spokesman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The clash, which occurred early Friday, was the first of its kind since Indian 
troops were sent to Sri Lanka nearly two years ago, but the spokesman called 
the incident a mistake and said both countries consider the matter closed. 
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan soldier fired on an Indian patrol of between 20 and 30 soldiers 
passing a remote jungle camp, setting off a brief fire fight, said the 
spokesman, who requested anonymity. The shooting occurred near Vavuniya, about 
140 miles northeast of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange of fire between the two sides "lasted for a short while. It was 
stopped when the mistake was realized," the New Delhi spokesman said. "It was 
decided to treat the matter as closed and not to publicize it.

TRAIL ADVOCATES PUSH TO GET DEVELOPMENT PLAN BACK ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Jim Miller wants to air it out, really let the workaday cares melt away 
and commune a bit with nature, he saddles up his 15-year-old quarter horse, 
Pat, and heads into the San Diego County outback on a trail. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had some wonderful experiences," said Miller, a real estate attorney who 
lives in La Mesa. "I'll go on one of those hills above Sweetwater Reservoir and 
see a couple hundred Canadian geese circle and circle and come in on the lake. 
The honkers are just yakking and they set their wings and come skiing in. It's 
quite a sight." 
</P>
<P>
Miller worries, however, that the tidal wave of development in many parts of 
the fast-growing county could shut out residents in the years to come from the 
chance to enjoy the sort of backcountry pleasures that can be experienced only 
by hitting a trail. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a cadre of trail advocates, Miller is pushing these days for the 
County Board of Supervisors to reinstitute a moribund plan outlining a network 
of hiking and horseback riding trails to be developed throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
The trail plan was undermined by a pro-growth board in the early 1980s. 
Battered but not defeated, trail boosters now want to see the plan returned to 
its original vigor, complete with provisions requiring property owners to grant 
easements for future trails as their land is developed. 
</P>
<P>
Although such actions could spark opposition from property rights advocates 
concerned about losing exclusive use of their land, backers of a trail network 
contend that the effort to preserve existing trails and establish new ones must 
move forward before time runs out. 
</P>
<P>
"The more subdivisions the county puts through, the more trail opportunities we 
lose," said Miller, president of the San Diego County Trails Council. "It's 
simply not fair to future generations for someone to say the property they are 
developing for resale to new residents should be excluded from properly 
designed recreational uses." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the county's trail network has advanced only when developers 
were willing to voluntarily dedicate a public right of way for a trail. All too 
often, builders simply chose not to grant the easements, and the result has 
been a patchwork system missing numerous key links. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tantamount to developing a road system and saying that no one has to 
provide a road unless they want to," said Jack Redfern, the county's trails 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the trail network say the plan is a cost-effective way to provide 
recreational opportunities and ensure that residents will be able to enjoy the 
open space areas that remain after the dust of the development boom settles. 
</P>
<P>
"In most cases, studies have shown that there is a direct relationship between 
the quality of health and decreased crime in areas which provide open space," 
said Dick Hubbard, a leader of the North County Trails Coalition, a group 
advocating the countywide trail network. "From an economic point of view, open 
space and recreational amenities pay for themselves. Trails can be provided at 
little or no cost and provide maximum recreational opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Pam Bender, a horsewoman who enjoys the trails around her Rancho Santa Fe home, 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"They provide such a great benefit for an area," Bender said. "They're a crime 
deterrent, and they get people to get out in the community. So often, people 
live their lives just getting in the car and going from the garage to the store 
and back again." 
</P>
<P>
Miller emphasized that trails mapped out in the plan would be dedicated as a 
public right of way only when a piece of property is submitted to planners for 
a development project. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not putting a trail across anyone's living room, we're not going to put 
it across the corner of their vacant property," he said. "It's done when the 
property is developed." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he argues that the trails add to a parcel's price tag, adding an 
amenity that serves as a potent drawing card when houses sprout from the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Any developer who has any sense of fair play plus a natural acumen to make 
money should just be overjoyed and tickled pink to work with the county and 
whatever city to provide trails," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Potential pitfalls may be raised by a handful of opponents, but Miller and 
others see ready answers. 
</P>
<P>
Maintenance costs? Most trails virtually take care of themselves, with hoof, 
foot and mountain bike traffic keeping the path smooth, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Liability risks? Miller says he has not found anywhere in the state where a 
government agency has paid a damage award for an injury sustained on an 
officially sanctioned trail. 
</P>
<P>
Trail boosters envision an integrated system with major trails, such as the 
California Riding and Hiking Trail and the proposed San Dieguito River Valley 
Park Trail, linked up with smaller paths leading from suburban communities. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the county has more than 50 miles of trails formally dedicated for 
public use. Other existing trails, however, have yet to be recognized as 
official rights of way. Still others remain a glimmer in the eye of trail 
advocates eager to see the rural outback crisscrossed by a web of interlinking 
dirt pathways. 
</P>
<P>
While the Board of Supervisors has yet to take up the issue of a countywide 
trail network, the group increasingly seems to be favoring the idea. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the board has approved trail systems in several unincorporated 
sections of the county, including Rancho Santa Fe and Ramona. Advocates were 
upset, however, when members of the board failed to show for a meeting in April 
that drew nearly 200 supporters of the trail plan. 
</P>
<P>
Various cities have taken up the cause. A proposed park bond in Encinitas would 
include $1 million for a citywide trail system. Officials in Poway, meanwhile, 
have for years worked hard to maintain a network of trails in that inland city 
and were recently awarded more than $150,000 to build new paths. 
</P>
<P>
Trail advocates, meanwhile, have scored victories of their own in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Bender and others, for instance, convinced the developer of the 500-acre 
Horizon Country Club in Rancho Santa Fe to include a perimeter trail around the 
property, even though the subdivision was not designed to attract horse people. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's group, meanwhile, has volunteered countless hours to forge trails in 
the Sweetwater area and also helped secure $75,000 in state money to restore a 
lengthy stretch of the California Riding and Hiking Trail through San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits are well worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me we have a recreational resource right under our noses that we 
ought to pay attention to," Miller said. "Trails open up a community to a 
higher level of conviviality, of socialness (sic) and niceness. It's a 
situation where, as a society, we have a resource that's not taking anything 
from anyone, but it's giving a lot back."

NURSE REGISTRIES HAILED, ASSAILED BY HOSPITAL STAFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is 6:45 a.m., and the medical reinforcements are arriving at Kaiser 
Permanente's towering Panorama City hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen nurses and attendants in sensible shoes and collarless white 
shirts, part of a small army of temporary medical workers brought in each day 
to staff Southern California hospitals during a continuing nursing crisis, sign 
in near the bustling emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
"We need them to function," said Anita Zermeno, operating room nursing 
supervisor. But while most of the temporaries are capable, Zermeno said, some 
have such limited abilities that she must give them easy assignments. She also 
orders a staff nurse to watch over them, which she said is galling since a 
temporary nurse is paid at least $5 an hour more than a staff nurse. 
</P>
<P>
"Here comes someone getting the big bucks and all they can do is a 
hysterectomy," Zermeno said. "Give me a break." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
40% of Staff 
</P>
<P>
A national nursing shortage has made a number of medical facilities reliant on 
agencies, commonly known as registries, that supply temporary nurses and 
attendants. In some hospitals at times, 40% of the nursing staff is from 
outside registries, while the figure is as high as 80% in some nursing homes, 
health-care specialists said. 
</P>
<P>
Some hospital officials now see the registries, once considered a solution to 
staff shortages, as a part of the problem. Critics said that registries are 
competing with institutions for nursing school graduates and are draining off 
staff nurses by offering pay that hospitals cannot match. 
</P>
<P>
Members of an association of state nursing homes grew so frustrated that they 
persuaded Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) to introduce legislation 
that would put the agencies out of business -- even though without them many 
hospitals and nursing homes would have trouble staffing their facilities. 
Felando put the bill, sponsored by the California Assn. of Health Facilities, 
on hold after the registries rose up in protest. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my druthers, they would not exist," Donna Robinson, associate 
director of nursing at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar, said of the 
registries. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the nursing shortage was brought on by a changing business climate 
that has made traditionally male-dominated careers more attractive to women who 
ordinarily might choose nursing as a vocation. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some nurses are deciding against the long hours and pressure 
of working on a hospital staff. If they go to work for a registry, they can 
pick and choose from the jobs offered. They can turn down a job if they don't 
like the hours or the hospital. If they feel like taking a vacation, they can 
just go. 
</P>
<P>
They also earn more money because hospitals pay premium rates to the registries 
for skilled nursing personnel, although the difference in wages is partly 
offset by the health benefits offered to hospital staffs. 
</P>
<P>
A registered nurse is paid $15 to $17 an hour to work in a nursing home, while 
registries may pay upward of $27 an hour. Olive View, a public hospital run by 
Los Angeles County, pays $573.50 to the registry for a nurse to work a single, 
12-hour shift on the weekend in critical care. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business is doing very, very well now," said Pat Donohoe, vice president 
of business development for NSI Home Health Care. 
</P>
<P>
The industry as a whole is booming, according to health-care observers. 
Hospital nursing supervisors said they get several calls a week from new 
registries springing up. "It's a gas war out there," Penny Hammer, nursing 
supervisor at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, said of the competitive 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Figures on the usage of registry nurses at hospitals demonstrate the importance 
of registries to the delivery of health care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Costs 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986-87 fiscal year, Los Angeles County paid $1 million for temporary 
nurses at its six public hospitals, including Olive View. In the previous 
fiscal year, the figure was $3.3 million. This year, it is expected to soar to 
$12 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The University of California's teaching hospitals have seen a similar growth 
pattern. UCLA Medical Center spent $2.4 million for registry nurses in the last 
nine months of the 1986-87 fiscal year, according to figures gathered by the 
California Nurses Assn. That amount nearly tripled last fiscal year, to $6.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
All this has put the nurse who is looking for work in an advantageous position. 
"Every registry in town is fighting to get that nurse," said Carmen Baker, 
regional director of STAT Nurses Registry, which has an office in Granada 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The increasingly competitive market among registries has caused some of them to 
begin offering benefits and even bonuses and vacations to nurses to encourage 
them to sign up. Several agencies have resorted to hiring nurses over the 
phone, without checking their credentials, some hospital officials say. 
</P>
<P>
This has led to problems. Hammer said one agency sent a nurse attendant who was 
unable to take a patient's temperature. The attendant, it turned out, had never 
worked at a hospital before. "I called the registry. They had not checked her 
references. They just put her to work," Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dangerous Errors 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, Hammer said, nurses have showed up in clothes so dirty that 
they had to be sent home to change. One temporary nurse administered a 
potentially fatal dose of medication to a patient, Hammer said. The patient 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
And another nurse assistant at Valley Presbyterian cursed a patient who was 
complaining of pain. "She said, in effect, 'It's in your head.' She fired 
four-letter words off" at the patient and at the hospital and walked off the 
job, Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the criticism, however, nursing supervisors agree that the vast 
majority of registry nurses are skilled professionals who know their jobs as 
well as most staff nurses. 
</P>
<P>
"We screen very carefully," Baker said. "The nurses that we send out are highly 
qualified." Before sending a nurse on a job, STAT checks to see that the nurse 
has at least one year of hospital experience, as well as experience in 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and a nursing license. 
</P>
<P>
"The mama-and-papa registries are the ones that are hurting us," Baker said. 
"When we refuse a nurse, they sign up with the mamas and papas who are working 
out of their homes." 
</P>
<P>
Chip Baker, director of human resources for ARA Living Centers, a large nursing 
home company in California, said there are many "fly-by-night" agencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horror Stories 
</P>
<P>
Jean Orr, chief of the state Bureau of Personnel Services in Sacramento, has 
heard the horror stories. Although her office is supposed to regulate the 
industry, the vast majority of registries are not required to file papers with 
her, or are operating outside the law. Only 50 agencies are registered with her 
office, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can find 50 in any community of Southern California right now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
By law, nursing agencies must register with her office only if they require 
employees to pay them a fee to work. Many are paid directly by hospitals. Then 
there are others that operate without required licenses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've got white shoes and a clean white shirt, you can be a nurse's aide 
and open a registry," she said. "There is a whole unregulated industry out 
there. No one really has a handle on it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hospitals Blamed 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of Rose Ann De Moro, assistant director for collective bargaining 
of the California Nurses Assn., the hospitals have only themselves to blame for 
the situation. Hospitals would be better able to hang on to staff nurses if 
they paid them more and gave them more freedom in setting their hours, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals are making registries a very appealing place to go," she said. "It's 
not like registries are out there trying to overthrow the hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
Now nurses are feeling their power. "You're seeing a whole different kind of 
nurse these days," said Shirley Hamill, associate director for the Western 
United States of Upjohn Health Care Services, which operates a nursing agency. 
This new crop of nurses is more assertive, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nursing agencies "give them another option to keep them in the hospitals," said 
William York, executive director of AMI Health Care Staffing, a nursing agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem Worsens 
</P>
<P>
But spokesmen for health-care facilities say just the reverse is happening -- 
nurses are being drained from the hospitals. Registries have "worsened the 
situation," said David Helmsin, a spokesman for the California Assn. of Health 
Facilities, which represents nursing homes. Registries "are like vultures 
almost, feeding on a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
The agencies have not only forced hospitals to compete with them for nurses, 
but with one another, critics say. Hospitals with bad reputations, or in poor 
areas, may find it difficult to locate even a temporary nurse on some days. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson at Olive View said it can take as many as 44 phone calls to find a 
nurse. Then, "it's not unusual for a registry to call two hours before" a shift 
begins "and say, 'Nurse Jane Doe cannot work for you.' We do a little checking 
and we find Nurse Doe is at Northridge" Hospital Medical Center, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is magnified in nursing homes, which run on slim financial 
margins because they depend more heavily on government reimbursement. They 
cannot afford to pay nurses what acute-care hospitals pay. As a result, keeping 
staff becomes difficult. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changing Staff 
</P>
<P>
Nursing home officials said some facilities are run almost entirely by 
employees of registries, which may change daily. A nurse on the floor only one 
day may not notice signs that a patient is deteriorating, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires three hours of nursing care per patient a day. It also 
requires that a registered nurse be on duty at all times at larger facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Nursing homes have trouble attracting required ancillary staff, which include 
nurse's aides, and hire registry personnel at up to $20 an hour for jobs that 
normally pay about $5 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a strain on budgets. The cost of registry employees for ARA's 30 
California nursing homes doubled from 1987 to 1988, and there is a chance that 
it will double again this year, officials said.

MOURNING ON MELROSE; 
</P>
<P>
MERCHANTS FEAR PARKING LIMITS WILL HURT SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years now, black has been the color of choice on Melrose Avenue. The 
whimsical neon-studded beacon for trendy shoppers, which boasts such novelty 
stores as Wacko and Retail Slut, may attract more people in black clothes than 
most funerals. 
</P>
<P>
These days, however, it's the Melrose merchants who are in mourning. 
</P>
<P>
The merchants say that a highly restrictive public parking proposal expected to 
win the Los Angeles City Council's approval by the end of the year would be the 
death of the pedestrian thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
"It would just totally kill us," said Sebastion Giefer, owner of Joys &amp; 
Toys, a children's shop. "We can't deal with it. Where are our customers going 
to go to find parking?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Parking Limits 
</P>
<P>
The proposal that has Giefer as wound up as one of his toys would severely 
limit parking in most neighborhoods off Melrose during the day and prohibit it 
at night. Giefer and other concerned merchants say the restrictions would make 
Melrose -- which many consider to be the city's premier walking street -- 
virtually inaccessible to anyone living outside the immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
Others say that a threat to Melrose is a threat to the city's quirky 
personality, because it is the only thoroughfare in Los Angeles, and one of the 
few in the world, that offers such an eclectic mix of goods. People shopping 
the one-mile strip can find everything from ceramic figurines to leather sexual 
devices and foods ranging from All-American burgers to Italian osso buco. 
</P>
<P>
But that concern may not be enough to sway city officials, who are expected to 
side with disgruntled neighbors in the dispute. Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who 
represents the area, said residents have a legitimate beef against visitors who 
clog their streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Melrose has become one of the city's great streets," Yaroslavsky said. "But we 
have to balance that jewel in L.A.'s crown against the blemish that exists on 
the side streets." 
</P>
<P>
Several people who were shopping on Melrose recently were dismayed when 
informed of the preferential parking proposal. Harry Fisher, a Los Angeles 
native living in Allentown, Pa., who regularly visits Melrose when he is in 
town, said he might stop shopping there if parking is restricted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd circle for about 15 minutes and then I'd go somewhere else," Fisher said. 
"It's already hard enough to park here. Less parking would be an incentive for 
staying away." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Mazalatis of Los Angeles, sitting under an umbrella at a restaurant 
called The Burger That Ate L.A., predicted that restrictions would "kill the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favored Spots 
</P>
<P>
The narrow residential streets near Melrose have always been the favored 
parking sites for visitors, because the city provides only limited metered 
parking along the thoroughfare. Residents who live on the streets crossing 
Melrose between Fairfax and La Brea avenues say their neighborhoods often 
resemble large parking lots on busy shopping days. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers usually start arriving shortly after noon, when many of the shops open. 
The parade of cars, with radios blaring and seats filled with boisterous 
people, can last well into early morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Weiner, a homeowner and president of the Melrose Action Committee, said 
business operators should provide parking for their patrons. "We feel that the 
businesses have been very irresponsible," she said. "It isn't fair for people 
to come home at night and be forced to park two blocks away." 
</P>
<P>
Merchants respond that the city bears the burden of finding parking places, 
having encouraged the decade-long transformation of Melrose from a stretch of 
mom-and-pop shops serving the neighborhood into a mecca for avant-garde 
businesses attracting international jet-setters, skinheads, punk rockers -- and 
middle-America tourists whose only nod to the black fashion ethic is the socks 
they wear with their shorts. 
</P>
<P>
"Every other city with this type of shopping has municipal parking lots," said 
James Zimmerman, co-owner of an imported ceramics store called Cottura. "L.A. 
is the only place that doesn't. And that's why we have this problem. We're 
treated like stepchildren here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$8,000 Monthly Rents 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman is one of the leaders of Merchants on Melrose (MOM), an organization 
devoted to protecting the interests of about 200 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
He said that merchants, who pay as much as $8,000 a month in rent for Melrose 
locations, have too much invested in the street to go down without a fight. 
They have hired an attorney to represent them in the dispute and may even 
challenge the city in court if officials go forward with plans for preferential 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
Constitutional law specialist Carl Grumer said that merchants, whose businesses 
are a source of sizable sales tax revenues for the city, may have legitimate 
grounds for challenging the parking plan. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to merchants, Grumer, an attorney hired by the merchants, said 
preferential parking may even constitute a restraint of trade. Yaroslavsky, 
however, said business people have nothing to fear from permit parking, which 
has already been upheld as constitutional by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we have a permit parking district pending, merchants say it will be 
a disaster for them," Yaroslavsky said. "But we don't know of anyone who has 
gone out of business." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residents Pay a Fee 
</P>
<P>
Under city guidelines, preferential parking is considered only in areas where 
two-thirds of the residents of a six-block or larger area favor the idea. Once 
a district is approved, residents pay $15 annually for parking permits. They 
are also required to purchase permits for guests. 
</P>
<P>
There are 30 preferential parking zones in the city -- up from 20 two years ago 
-- with the lion's share of them in crowded Westside communities, including 
Westwood and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
One permit parking zone already is in place along a short stretch of Melrose 
between Crescent Heights Boulevard and Harper Avenue. That district is far to 
the west of the heavily traveled pedestrian path that most people know as the 
Melrose shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal calls for permit districts on each side of the busy 
thoroughfare. The northern district would stretch from Gardner Street to La 
Brea and from Melrose to the West Hollywood line. The southern district would 
run from Gardner to Highland Avenue and from Beverly Boulevard to Melrose, 
leaving only six blocks of Melrose side streets unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shuttle Bus a Possibility 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said the city is exploring ways to ease the parking crunch that 
will result from the permit districts. Running a shuttle bus out of the parking 
lot at Fairfax High School at Melrose and Fairfax avenues has been under 
consideration for several months. The city could also purchase parcels of land 
along Melrose for use as parking lots with the $8 million in parking meter 
funds that are allocated to Yaroslavsky's 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
The catch, however, is that any additional parking probably will not become 
available for at least a year, meaning that permit parking would precede 
anything designed to offset its effect. 
</P>
<P>
John Strobel, co-owner of Angeli Caffe, said there is no way merchants can wait 
for new parking to be provided -- while their customers shop elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to hurt our business a lot," he said. "And it could be disastrous. 
This is a famous street. Where else will people go, some god-awful mall?"

A SPOUSAL TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent commentary ("Judge Mirrors Spousal-Abuse Myths," July 9) by Joyce 
Faidley unfairly criticizes Judge Bernard E. Revak for comments he made during 
the sentencing of Cmdr. Larry J. Evans for spousal rape. Faidley's passion for 
the plight of battered women causes her to ignore facts that fully support the 
comments made by Revak. 
</P>
<P>
An orchestrated effort was made by battered-women groups like Faidley's to 
intimidate Revak to make an example of Evans. The public pressure began with 
television appearances by Mary Evans three days before Cmdr. Evans' sentencing 
and was culminated by a courtroom filled with Mary Evans' supporters and a 
petition signed by battered women (most of whom knew little about the details 
of Cmdr. Evans' case) urging Revak to impose the maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Revak deserves credit for resisting this lynch-mob mentality and doing his job, 
which is to impose sentence based on individual merits. Revak properly 
considered that Larry Evans overcame poverty and segregated schools in the Deep 
South to earn a scholarship to Harvard Dental School, the privilege to practice 
dentistry and a distinguished 17-year military career. 
</P>
<P>
Faidley fails to acknowledge that Mary Evans psychologically abused her husband 
by carrying on an open affair with another man during the marriage. The stress 
and anxiety resulting from Mary Evans' infidelity caused Cmdr. Evans to be 
hospitalized with hypertension a few weeks before the sexual assault. Mary 
Evans exacerbated this volatile situation by inviting Cmdr. Evans back into the 
family residence, resuming a sexual relationship with him while continuing her 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
While Cmdr. Evans' violent reaction was deplorable, California directs Revak to 
consider these unusual circumstances. They also support his comments that Mary 
Evans bore some responsibility for the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Faidley criticizes Revak for lamenting that state law required him to send a 
man of Cmdr. Evans' caliber to state prison. Perhaps Revak understands that the 
state prison population is bursting at the seams (approximately 82,000 inmates 
in a system designed for 37,000). Incarcerating Cmdr. Evans will cost the 
taxpayers of the state $19,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
Revak commented that it would be far more appropriate to require Evans to use 
his skill as a dentist and perform community service for battered women or poor 
people, rather than languishing in prison. Interestingly enough, this 
alternative was proposed by a respected female forensic psychologist who 
frequently evaluates offenders for state judges. 
</P>
<P>
Faidley's commentary fails to mention that Revak protected Mary Evans during 
the trial. He limited the defense's cross-examination of her, which sought to 
elicit details of her sexual relationship with her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Over defense objection, Revak permitted Mary Evans to testify about prior acts 
of spousal abuse committed by Cmdr. Evans, even though they were totally 
unsubstantiated. These rulings contributed to the conviction of Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Faidley criticizes Revak for imposing only an 11-year term. The judge could 
have imposed as little as three years. Faidley cannot seriously argue that a 
potential spousal rapist would not be deterred by 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic that Faidley attacks Revak for being insensitive to victims of 
domestic violence. As a prosecutor, Revak represented the interests of hundreds 
of victims of violent crimes. He knows the physical and emotional trauma 
suffered by them. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the motives of Faidley and the battered-women groups must be 
questioned. Three months before Cmdr. Evans' trial, Mary Evans said she did not 
want to see her husband go to prison and lose his military and dental careers. 
Months later, Mary Evans was before the television cameras, with the 
battered-women groups urging her on, demanding that her husband be sentenced to 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
But, once the camera lights dim, what about the future of Mary Evans and the 
Evans' three children? Will Cmdr. Evansd' serving 11 years in prison solve the 
complex problem of spousal rape? Are the three children better off with their 
father in prison and unable to support them? Faidley seems to think so. Perhaps 
Mary Evans will realize one day that Revak understands the tragedy of family 
violence far better than Faidley and her battered-women groups do.

REFLECTIONS: 'I CAN'T PAINT A PICTURE, BUT GIVE ME A PAIR OF SCISSORS . . .'

Two years ago, Margaret Eaton would have scoffed at the idea of doing anything 
other than the political consulting and lobbying she had done for years. Yet, 
after rising from door-to-door soliciting for a grass-roots labor organization 
in Cleveland to becoming field director for the National Abortion Rights Action 
in Washington, Eaton chucked it all -- without a clear notion of what she would 
do next. The 32-year-old woman fell into creating handbags as Christmas gifts, 
then delved into creating artsy earrings, necklaces and pins out of clay and 
plastic. Now, from the workshop in her North Park home, Eaton is busy crafting 
hundreds of pairs of earrings to sell this fall at art shows in Southern 
California. Times staff writer Caroline Lemke interviewed her, and Vince 
Compagnone photographed her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
My mom says ever since I was a little girl I always was very interested in 
politics in some way, even if it was just what was on the news or what was 
going on in the neighborhood. I was always asking, "Why are these people doing 
this?" and "Is it the right thing to do?" 
</P>
<P>
I went to a small, private liberal arts college, which was expensive. I come 
from a big family of 12 kids, and I had financial aid for the first three 
years, but in the middle of my third year there was a problem and I didn't get 
my financial aid. And it was so expensive I was going to drop out for a year 
and get a job. The first job I found was with this political organization in 
Cleveland. They were working on issues that affect labor and the people in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
I was 19 years old, and I learned more in two weeks working that job than I 
learned in 2 1/2 years in college. I got really interested, and, before I knew 
it, I was running one of these operations, and I was an organizer. I just kind 
of moved up the ladder from there. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I finished (with politics), I had been a lobbyist in the state of 
Washington, I had run a successful City Council campaign in Seattle, and I had 
worked on a big union election campaign in California for the California State 
Employees. That was very exciting. So I tried all these things I really wanted 
to do before I actually gave it up completely. 
</P>
<P>
I never thought I would quit until the last year and a half. I never thought I 
wouldn't do it forever, but then something just happened. It wasn't like this 
conscious choice that I didn't want to do political work anymore because 
somehow I don't believe in it. If anything, my feelings about certain things 
are still very, very strong. I just had this other part of me. I've always been 
a tinkerer. I sewed clothes when I was in high school. That's how I got 
started, by making handbags. 
</P>
<P>
There's a place in Seattle where I was living, an open-air market that has 200 
spaces reserved for artists and crafts people who live in the state. My sister 
and I got a space, and I started making different kinds of purses and handbags 
and tote bags out of upholstery fabric with big cabbage rose prints. And we 
made a little money. 
</P>
<P>
It was so exciting. I got into the whole thing of if you make 10 bags and sell 
them for this amount of money. . . . Everyone kidded me. They said, "Oh, you're 
just organizing this little world," because I was putting all my political 
organizing skills into this. I love cash-flow projections, and I love 
strategies and time lines. 
</P>
<P>
I switched to jewelry because I like shapes. Even when I made handbags, the 
thing I liked was coming up with the most unusual shape you could make for a 
handbag. I'm much better at sculpting things instead of painting. I can't paint 
a picture, but give me a pair of scissors . . . 
</P>
<P>
This year, I'm going to do about 30 art shows. I'll do about 18 in the fall, 
every weekend. That's why all summer now I'm making stuff to get ready to sell. 
I do pins, earrings, bola ties, bracelets and necklaces. 
</P>
<P>
I think people aren't meant to do one thing their whole life. I think that 
people who do do one thing their whole life are either very driven and very 
passionate about it, or they're trapped and they can't leave their job.

ALBERT W. BATES, EX-NEWSPAPERMAN, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Albert W. Bates, former editorial page director of the Orange Coast Daily Pilot 
and one-time public relations assistant to the U.S. postmaster general, died 
Saturday in Hemet after a long illness. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
Bates was with the Daily Pilot from 1961 until 1972, when he joined the U.S. 
Postal Service during the Nixon Administration. He retired from that post in 
1974. He began his newspaper career in the Midwest, and from 1929 to 1934 
served as executive director of Sigma Delta Chi, the national journalism 
society now known as the Society of Professional Journalists. He was one of 
only two people to twice win the society's coveted Wells Key for services to 
journalism and the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the society in the middle of the Depression, Bates became a public 
relations consultant for the meat packing firm of Swift and Co. in Chicago. He 
moved to Honolulu in the late 1940s as a director of public relations for a 
company there. He later became vice president of Hill and Knowlton publishers 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
While with the Daily Pilot, Bates received the California Newspaper Publisher's 
Assn. award in 1968 for the best editorial page in California. 
</P>
<P>
He also belonged to the Public Relations Society of America, the National Press 
Club, Orange County Press Club, Dutch Treat Club-West and the Huntington Beach 
Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Marianne of Hemet; two daughters, Lynn Bryan of 
Etna, Calif., and Katheryn Hill of Norfolk, Va.; a son, Albert K. Bates of 
Summer Town, Tenn., and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
No funeral services are planned. The family has requested that any memorial 
contribution be sent to the Ramona Hospice in Hemet.

talks with the government, their leader said. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of demonstrations by high school students and anxiety by the people, 
we have decided to seek a solution through dialogue," said Lee Man Ho, leader 
of more than 6,000 teachers who formed a union illegally earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 teachers at more than 500 schools across the country joined the

DEVELOPER TRIES TO PUT HOUSES ON EASTPORT SITE; 
</P>
<P>
MISSION CANYON OWNERSHIP KEY TO LAND-SWAP PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Real estate developer Ray A. Watt's complex land-swap proposal would pave the 
way for his firm to build hundreds of high-priced homes on Santa Monica 
Mountains property embroiled in a protracted legal battle pitting developers 
against homeowners and the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Watt, one of California's biggest and politically well-connected builders, is 
seeking to construct up to 750 homes in the Mission and Mandeville canyons area 
west of the San Diego Freeway and south of Mulholland Drive. As part of a 
complex series of high-stakes deals, Watt has proposed that his company obtain 
Mission Canyon from Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Discussion 
</P>
<P>
Watt's tentative proposal -- a copy of which was obtained by The Times -- is 
under discussion at the same time that Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) 
is trying to negotiate an agreement with city and county officials involving 
many of the same properties, including a proposed landfill in Elsmere Canyon in 
the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Under Watt's three-page plan, which has been distributed to numerous city, 
county and federal officials, the following would occur: 
</P>
<P>
Watt Industries would make the Hatchet Ranch it owns north of Jackson Hole, 
Wyo., available to the U. S. Forest Service, which has long sought to obtain 
the property in scenic Buffalo Valley. In exchange, the Forest Service would 
give land in Elsmere Canyon to a city or county government agency for a 
landfill. Watt's company would also provide 630 acres that it owns in adjacent 
Whitney Canyon for access to the dump. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) plans to introduce a bill shortly to swap 
rights to the Wyoming property for Elsmere Canyon. Under the measure, the 
Forest Service would not acquire the Hatchet Ranch but would obtain a "scenic 
easement," which means that the property could only be used for ranching and 
farming, not for real estate development, said Wallop spokesman Stan Cannon. 
Watt would still own it. 
</P>
<P>
Watt would share in the "tipping fees, surcharges and other revenue sharing" 
from the landfill, which would have a capacity of about 200 million tons. Watt 
did not specify his percentage in the proposal. But one of those privy to the 
negotiations said the developer is asking for $3 for each ton of garbage, or 
$600 million over several decades. 
</P>
<P>
Watt would deed 1,200 acres next to Rustic and Sullivan canyons in the Santa 
Monica Mountains between Mission Canyon and Topanga Canyon Boulevard to a 
federal or state parks agency. In exchange, Los Angeles County would deed 
Mission Canyon to Watt and all of Rustic and Sullivan to a park agency as 
permanent open space. 
</P>
<P>
The city would permit Watt Industries to build 300 housing units in Mandeville 
Canyon and as many as 450 other residences in Mandeville and Mission canyons. 
Homes in the area -- some of which afford spectacular views of Brentwood and 
the Westside -- sell for upwards of $500,000. Numerous city permits and 
approvals would be necessary for the project to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Watt Industries would pay the county up to $70 million to offset the costs of 
closing Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons as possible landfill sites. The 
county has been determined to retain the canyons as long- term landfill 
options, especially with Los Angeles rapidly running out of dumping space. 
</P>
<P>
Various officials involved in the behind-the-scenes discussions -- including 
Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Mike Gage -- say Watt is a factor in the negotiations. 
But Gage called Watt's initial proposal "totally unacceptable to the city," and 
Berman said he would not be party to a package that includes construction of 
750 homes in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Clout 
</P>
<P>
Still, Watt's political and financial clout and strategically located 
landholdings have prompted some of those involved in the process to suggest 
that he could be an impediment to an agreement. Environmentalists, meanwhile, 
privately express concern that Watt could wind up with the city's support to 
build far more houses in the mountains than otherwise might have been 
politically possible. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very high-power, he's a very wealthy man, he's got lots of friends in 
City Hall," said Nita Rosenfeld, who heads the Mandeville Canyon Assn.'s 
governmental committee. "It's going to be a formidable battle to make sure that 
he doesn't get away with anything." 
</P>
<P>
Watt Industries in Santa Monica, one of scores of real estate companies in 
which Watt is a principal, posted $420 million in housing sales in 1987, the 
second highest total in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Like other large land developers, Watt has been generous to elected officials 
who decide on real estate projects. Since 1984, Watt, his companies and company 
employees have given at least $155,000 in campaign contributions to city and 
county politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The top recipients have been the campaign committees of Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley, $25,850, and County Supervisors Deane Dana, $21,000, and Mike 
Antonovich, $17,600. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Influence 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possible influence of Watt's contributions, Gage replied: 
"Contributions are never a factor in weighing people's proposals in this 
office." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the influential Los Angeles law firm of Manatt, Phelps, 
Rothenberg, Tunney &amp; Phillips is representing Watt on his land-swap 
proposal. Bradley has retained the firm to represent him in the city attorney's 
inquiry into his ties with two financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Berman has been contacted by Charles T. Manatt, a senior partner in the firm 
and a former national Democratic Party chairman, and Mickey Kantor, a 
well-connected Democratic attorney from the firm, according to Gene Smith, 
Berman's chief Washington aide. Neither Manatt nor Kantor returned phone calls 
to discuss the Watt proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Watt, 70, was out of town and could not be reached last week. He lives in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really the one who should be discussing it," said Meg Gilbert, director 
of special projects for Watt Industries. "It's sensitive and complicated." 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-acre Mandeville property where Watt proposes to build 500 
single-family homes already has a long and controversial history. It is owned 
by Eastport Associates, which filed for bankruptcy after it was unable to 
develop the property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$69-Million Offer 
</P>
<P>
Eastport has accepted a $69-million offer for the land from Watt-Terramics Co., 
another of Ray Watt's companies, said Robert Greenfield, an Eastport bankruptcy 
attorney. He said Eastport will ask the bankruptcy court to approve the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Eastport had received approval from the city in 1978 to build 300 residences on 
the property and 200 more if it could construct a secondary road to the site. 
</P>
<P>
But a lawsuit filed by the homeowners and other problems -- including Los 
Angeles County's refusal to approve the secondary road across county-owned 
property -- prevented the company from beginning construction by June, 1987. At 
that time, its most recent approval extension expired and, with it, the 
authority to build the 300 homes, said Deputy City Atty. Tom Kathe. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Legislature passed a bill sponsored by state Sen. Joseph B. 
Montoya (D-Whittier) that stipulated that any housing projects approved by a 
county Board of Supervisors would carry over when a new city is formed. 
However, a little-noticed provision in the measure had the effect of extending 
Eastport's subdivision approval until Jan. 1, 1992, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
"When we heard that, we were flabbergasted," Kathe said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastport had maintained that the construction approval never lapsed. But when a 
judge ruled otherwise, the company sought legislation that would apply 
retroactively to its project, said K. Phillip Nierim, Eastport's attorney. "I 
was principally responsible for drafting the legislation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge's Ruling 
</P>
<P>
The city argued that the law did not apply to the Eastport property, but 
Bankruptcy Court Judge Barry Russell ruled that it did. Watt-Terramics' 
$69-million offer had been contingent upon such a ruling, Eastport attorneys 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has appealed Russell's decision and the three Mandeville homeowners 
associations plan to file a supporting brief, said John B. Murdock, the 
associations' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
If Watt's proposal is accepted, the city presumably would drop its appeal. 
Acquiring Mission Canyon would give the developer the property for the road 
that is required to build the full 500 units. He would then need approval for 
the additional 250 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfeld of the homeowners association said Watt's plan appears to be a bid to 
circumvent the public process. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the man come in and show the public what he's going to do and then we'll 
talk."

RESCUE FAILS, TWO CHILDREN PERISH IN FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two children died in a house fire Saturday despite rescue efforts by Sheriff's 
deputies and a neighbor who were turned back by thick smoke and flames. 
</P>
<P>
County fire officials said the blaze at 2057 Lucien St., in the Willowbrook 
area, broke out shortly before 5:30 p.m. It took fire units only eight minutes 
to knock down the flames, said Inspector Joe Silva of the county Fire 
Department, but it still was too late to save the boy and girl who were trapped 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were identified by the coroner's office as Oscar Monterosa, 2, and 
Kenia Miranda, 3. The children were not related. 
</P>
<P>
According to neighbors, a woman who was inside the two-story house raced 
outside with an infant clutched in her arms, screaming that other children were 
trapped. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just screaming -- hollering," said Christina Silva, a neighbor and no 
relation to Joe Silva. "I guess there was too much smoke (for the woman) to 
grab the other ones." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flames Confined to Inside 
</P>
<P>
Christina Silva and another neighbor, 13-year-old Rocio Labrada, said heavy 
smoke poured from the house but the flames apparently were confined to the 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies arrived shortly before county fire units, said Labrada. 
</P>
<P>
"The cops (deputies) got here and tried to get in but couldn't," she said. 
Labrada said she saw a woman outside whom she believed was the mother of one of 
the trapped children. "She was crying. It was so sad." 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department spokesman Silva said a neighbor also was unsuccessful in rescue 
efforts. Several adults reportedly were inside the house when the fire broke 
out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire apparently began in the upstairs, rear bedroom in which the two 
youngsters died. Their bodies were found near a closet. Most of the damage was 
confined to the bedroom, Silva said. Investigators were trying to determine the 
cause.

HAWTHORNE MAY CUT JOBS TO TRIM PROJECTED DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hawthorne will probably have to resort to layoffs to offset at least part of a 
projected $2.5-million deficit in the city's $44.8-million budget for 1989-90, 
City Manager R. Kenneth Jue has told the City Council in his annual budget 
message. 
</P>
<P>
The city's 1989-90 budget is "in serious trouble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit occurred because the city received $1.1 million less in paramedic 
fees and sales taxes than anticipated for 1988-89, and an equal shortfall is 
projected for 1989-90, Jue said. 
</P>
<P>
To offset the deficit, Jue has asked all city department heads to reduce 
spending by 10% and has urged the City Council to increase revenues by raising 
city fees. 
</P>
<P>
Even with those measures, Jue warned in a somber, three-page letter 
accompanying the two-volume budget document that he has "requested the 
personnel director to research layoff procedures since it will probably come to 
that." 
</P>

<P>
Personnel Main Target 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Betty J. Ainsworth said in a telephone interview Friday that the council 
is "reviewing (Jue's) recommendations and considering the measures we will have 
to take to make up the lost revenues." The council is expected to set the date 
for a public hearing on the budget at its July 24 meeting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The city already has cut its capital expenditures, travel and supply costs, so 
"personnel will be the main targets of any additional slashes," Jue said in his 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting personnel will mean cutting services, and he warned: "The reduction in 
personnel will result in limited hours that staff will be available to the 
public and will likely cause delays on construction inspections." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne's per-capita expenditures are the lowest of 10 full-service South Bay 
cities, Jue reported. A survey of 1986-87 figures, the most recent available, 
show that Hawthorne spends $361 a year for each resident of the city, while the 
per-capita expenditures of neighboring full-service cities average $545, he 
said. A full-service city provides all of its own public services rather than 
contracting for police and fire protection, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of top City Hall administrators called together by the city manager 
to advise on the budget recommended that the council approve fee increases 
totaling $2,575,000 to resolve the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The need to increase fees or impose new ones "has never been more paramount," 
Jue said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed expenditures for 1989-90 reflect "zero growth" in all city departments 
except the Police Department, which plans to hire five more sworn officers, Jue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"One's immediate reaction to a budget deficit is to cut services," Jue said. 
"However, I feel that we are operating all departments at minimum staffing 
levels already, and we vitally need five additional police officers just for 
starters." It will cost about $300,000 to hire five officers, Jue said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next several years, the city plans to increase the police force to 100 
officers from 85, to cope with population growth and an increase in crime, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988-89, the city had expected $700,000 in paramedic fees and received 
$160,000, and anticipated sales tax revenues of $6.6 million but received only 
$6 million, for a deficit of about $1.1 million, Jue said in his letter. A 
similar shortfall in 1989-90 and the $300,000 for additional police services 
makes up the $2.5-million deficit in the current budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REVENUES FROM PROPOSED FEE INCREASES 
</P>
<P>
To help Hawthorne offset a projected $2.5-million deficit in the city's 
$44.8-million budget for 1989-90, city administrators have proposed fee 
increases yielding an additional $2.575 million in revenues. Here are the 
additional revenues produced by city fees if the adminstrators' recommendations 
are adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Building, planning and engineering fees: $200,000 
</P>
<P>
Development impact fees: $750,000 
</P>
<P>
Sewer service, street cleaning and tree trimming: $720,000 
</P>
<P>
Refuse collection: $550,000

BULGARIA TEEN-AGER USES UNDERCOVER PLOY TO JOIN EXODUS

A teen-ager hiding under a blanket in the trunk of a car was among 3,800 ethnic 
Turks who arrived in Turkey from Bulgaria in the past 24 hours, Anatolian news 
agency reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"If they'd caught me, I'd have been put in prison for the rest of my life," 
18-year-old Nihat Nurettinoglu told the agency after arriving in the trunk of 
his sister's car. 
</P>
<P>
Nurettinoglu said he had not been given a passport with the rest of his family 
because he was eligible for military service. Turkey says many families in 
similar situations in Bulgaria have left their young men behind. 
</P>
<P>
The new arrivals, carrying as much luggage as they could over the 
refugee-clogged border, brought to 146,000 the number of ethnic Turks who have 
fled Bulgaria since early June, Turkish officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Turks say they are escaping from a five-year program of forced 
assimilation, including compulsory name changes. Bulgaria says those going to 
Turkey are tourists.

STORIES ON FLIGHT OF TONY ALIENGENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is to express my appreciation for the wonderful news stories that 
you are writing about the flight of Tony Aliengena around the world and across 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
The amazing thing is that his and Lance Allyn's trip is to places that are not 
on the map. My 20-year-old world globe does not show Tumen, Bratsk or Mirnyi, 
not to mention Providenia. David Puckett's terrific map (July 2) may cause a 
million California readers to focus in on the vastness of the Soviet Union. I 
for one, a pilot of a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza based in Orange County, 
am sometimes aloft with these California adventurers, looking down on the 
wilderness (without rescue systems) and with my head in the engine compartment 
thinking about alternators, fuel system, hot pistons, oil pressure, magnetos 
holding together and hoping that the Russian navigators also know emergency 
landing fields. 
</P>
<P>
Although they are no Lindberghs, Howard Hugheses or Wiley Posts, these 
California fliers in their small Cessnas, Beechcrafts, flying over this great 
Siberian topography, they are in some ways "pushing the outside of the 
envelope."

A MAN WHO DIED COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED: HOW IS IT THAT HE WASN'T? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The kid in front of me squirmed and twisted a good deal. He was long and bony 
and his knees hurt him during the 40 minutes of kneeling. The men next to him 
were better padded. They had the big rounded shoulders of ex-fighters, now 
accustomed to heavy lifting, still in their work shirts, black men with Spanish 
names. They were brother-images to the man in the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
Visible in the open casket under a veil of white gauze was the forehead of Juan 
Antonio Jimenez, age 43. He lay banked by flowers in a Westminster chapel, in 
one of those moments of rented luxury that are granted the poorest bereaved. 
And beneath the comfortable folds of his satin bedding lay the legs that had 
been infected with the gangrene that killed him. 
</P>
<P>
His ordeal, as you may have read, lasted 20 days. He had been struck and hurt 
on the road north of Brawley and lodged in a desert hospital that had neither 
means nor equipment to deal with his injuries. There were nine that could, 
including four major centers in Orange County. The desert doctors strove 
mightily to get Jimenez admitted -- still alive, still savable -- to one of the 
nine. Not one felt able to take him. 
</P>
<P>
All of these Houses of Healing had good and sufficient reasons, issued through 
spokespersons, for turning Jimenez away. UCLA couldn't take him because he was 
too far off. Three San Diego hospitals couldn't find doctors to admit him. UC 
San Diego suggested Orange County because it was, after all, his home. UCI 
Medical Center adjudged itself full. St. Joseph couldn't take him because it 
didn't have a Medi-Cal contract. Fountain Valley thought he was too far away. I 
forget why Western Medical couldn't take him, but no doubt the reason was sound 
and clothed in the fact that no one without money or medical coverage has a 
legal right to be healed. Juan Jimenez would not be lying beneath a brown cross 
in Westminster if he'd had a Blue Cross in his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Bienaventurados los que sufren porque ellos seran consolados. 
</P>
<P>
 The priest recited the liturgy and the audience responded softly in Spanish. I 
think I was the only Anglo there, surely the only blond. The Jimenez widow and 
her household of eight shared their sorrow in the accustomed pew. My lack of 
Spanish left me free for somber reflections of another kind. 
</P>
<P>
How could a county of generous people be so collectively stingy? 
</P>
<P>
We live in the most-favored county of a well-favored state. Yet we can't afford 
to save a neighbor who mortally needs our help. Are we so busy making our own 
little pile of money and keeping it that we've forgotten we have neighbors? Was 
there no way we could have assured the funding of needed facilities without 
endless delay and further studies? 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, we could have and should still. 
</P>
<P>
Unless a decade of self-devotion has turned us into a county of clerks, 
assistant administrators, company spokespersons, mid-rank bureaucrats, 
subcommittee co-chairmen and dancing figures on a WordPerfect screen. Unless 
we've become so businesslike about passing the buck we've forgotten what our 
business is. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Jimenez was our business because he was our neighbor. Part of our county. 
One of us. So were the heavy-shouldered mourners saying the rosary in 
Westminster. They do the county's hard work, getting their nails dirty so we 
can keep ours clean. Those who don't know this aren't up on things, and those 
who don't care have souls that are running on empty. 
</P>
<P>
Yet we let him die on a Sunday morning of gangrene. Nobody dies of gangrene in 
a civilized place anymore. It is like a man dying of scurvy because nobody will 
give him an orange. 
</P>
<P>
In 62 unsheltered years I have seen death in most of its forms. I cannot 
remember one that has saddened me more. This one seemed tragic because it 
needn't have happened, suggesting a medieval carelessness about life unworthy 
of a glamorous county in this modern age. 
</P>
<P>
I never knew Jimenez and didn't know his family. But I had to go to his rosary, 
and I did and left by the side door.

NEEDY CLOSE TO HOME

<P>
I volunteer at the Share Our Selves (SOS) in Costa Mesa. We help feed and 
clothe our poor. As I read in the paper that our President is going to help the 
Polish poor, I wondered: If the president of either country came to our 
facility, would they be surprised at our own number of poor? Even the City 
Council of Costa Mesa is going to vote on whether to renew the lease for us, 
with a no vote considered because "there are no poor in Costa Mesa." 
</P>
<P>
We have mothers with children living in cars with no cooking facilities, so 
when we give them their bag of groceries, it has to contain food that doesn't 
have to be cooked.

Let's wake up and hear the cries of our own poor and help.

EMPLOYED WOMEN VS. HOMEMAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wendy Leece's letter (July 9) gave me the chills -- not because Mrs. Leece has 
chosen the life style of a full-time homemaker but because she and her 200 
friends who "have no intention of working outside the home" appear to be 
ignoring the reality that at some time most of them will be forced by necessity 
to contribute to their own support and that of their families. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics tell us that a majority of those women, due either to divorce or the 
death or disability of their spouses, will need to become financially 
productive. 
</P>
<P>
Working women do not cause broken marriages, as Leece implies. Homemakers with 
no marketable skills are often the victims of broken marriages. 
</P>
<P>
Living "simply" probably means that Leece will be ill-prepared when the 
"breadwinner" can no longer provide the bread. 
</P>
<P>
I urge Leece and her 200 friends to get trained and get ready or they will 
become displaced homemakers struggling to survive.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Revisionist Historian" Paul J. Bodnar's letter to The Times (July 9) was 
highly typical of religious right-zoomed-out-weebies and their continued 
attempts to present a reshapen historical fiction. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to remind Mr. Bodnar about that concept called "Separation of Church 
and State." It is the view that these two channels of power should be kept 
distinct. Now, our founding fathers were struck by this idea as being a rather 
swell one, and subsequently used in the First Amendment to our Constitution, 
thus keeping said powers separate, and preventing homogeneity between religious 
sects. 
</P>
<P>
I think this information adequately challenges Bodnar's allegation that "our" 
churches are "the reserved place of honor and respect for the American flag."

CITIZENS GROUP TO MEET ON CONTROLLED GROWTH

STOP (Stop Those Old Politicians), a citizens group formed by Rancho Palos 
Verdes resident Joel Justin King, will hold a public meeting Wednesday at 7:30 
p.m. at the Peninsula Center Library, 650 Deep Valley Drive, Rolling Hills 
Estates. 
</P>
<P>
King said the group advocates city ordinances in Rancho Palos Verdes that would 
limit development, limit City Council terms to two years -- a matter that the 
California Court of Appeal recently ruled is preempted by state law -- and 
lower rates for cable television on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.

EMIGRANT HAS HIS OWN SLANT ON GETTING AWAY FROM BIG-CITY BUSTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost half of all Los Angeles County residents are so disenchanted with the 
strains of big-city life, a recent Times poll showed, that they have considered 
moving within the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Seavey wants to show them the door. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old founder of Emigrants, a Pasadena-based relocation service, 
makes it his business to help people flee the crime, smog, traffic and 
skyrocketing home prices of Southern California for cheaper and greener 
pastures. 
</P>
<P>
His company's name is a bulky acronym for Endangered Metropolitan 
Inhabitants/Growth Opponents Resettling in Arcadian Neighborhoods, Towns and 
Suburbs. Arcadia refers not to the San Gabriel Valley community, but to an 
ancient Greek region that has come to symbolize a simpler, rustic life. 
</P>
<P>
For $45 a year, the 75 clients he has landed since founding the service in 
February get a copy of his quarterly newsletter called "Greener Pastures 
Gazette" and are invited to join him in a monthly rap session to commiserate 
over urban woes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Frantic Lives' 
</P>
<P>
"So many people are living frantic lives, chasing their own tails . . . barely 
hanging on," said Seavey, who lives with his wife and 9-year-old son in Sierra 
Madre. "The urban environment has become very brutish for some people." 
</P>
<P>
Seavey, a former social worker who has a degree in journalism from the 
University of Iowa, says he does not advocate specific communities for 
relocation nor is he interested in having everyone escape metropolitan Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he says he's merely responding to a social reality, trying to offer 
solutions and ease stress for Angelenos, 60% of whom believe the quality of 
life here has changed for the worse over the past 15 years, according to the 
same Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
"I want people to realize their life goals, to be able to focus on their inner 
needs and to do it within an environment that is healthy," said Seavey, who 
also teaches a course, "Find Your Personal Eden," at the Institute for 
Contemporary Concepts in West Los Angeles. "I'm just here to help them make the 
jump." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Population Shifts 
</P>
<P>
Increasing numbers of residents, according to state population records, are in 
fact taking the leap. 
</P>
<P>
The number of driver's license address changes, one of the few statistics 
demographers can use to determine the number of people leaving an area, show a 
growing exodus from metropolitan Los Angeles, said Elizabeth Hoag, research 
manager for the state Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 198,000 drivers moved away from Los Angeles County in 1985. More than 
204,000 left in 1986. The following year 210,000 left. And last year the number 
was 255,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the same period, however, there was a net increase in the county's 
population, mostly due to a high birth rate and the yearly arrival of about 
130,000 foreign immigrants, both documented and undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of people leaving are white families, the elderly and middle-class 
blacks, Hoag said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shuffling In and Out 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of have this picture in my mind of thousands of people from outside the 
United States shuffling into Los Angeles and thousands of people who were born 
here or who moved here a long time ago shuffling out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of picture that Seavey has too, although he cautions that forming 
a service called Emigrants had nothing to do with race. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, there's some white flight out there," he said. "But I'm not here to 
judge the prejudices of my clients. I'm just here to provide information." 
</P>
<P>
The people he provides information to include Diane, a former clothing designer 
in her 40s who lives in Sierra Madre on income from personal investments. 
Diane, who is single, said she would like to find a more pristine environment 
where she could pursue her love of landscape painting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
View of Trees 
</P>
<P>
"I have a nice yard and everything, but it's really hard to find a place around 
here where you can get a view of the trees and the hills," she said. "I've been 
thinking about Santa Fe. . . . Being able to see the sky and the weather 
conditions would really increase my sensory joy." 
</P>
<P>
Another client is Susan, a 49-year-old psychologist in West Los Angeles who 
says excessive pollution has caused health problems for her. She is concerned, 
however, that a smog-free community might also lack some of the big-city 
culture she needs to feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want a place with clean air, it might turn out to be a fairly 
unsophisticated, redneck community," she said. "That could be a problem. You 
want to make sure you have a certain number of like-minded people around you." 
</P>
<P>
And there's Ellis, 42, a former distribution executive for a Los Angeles 
newspaper who is living in a Hollywood apartment off the profit from the sale 
of his house. After being robbed and having his car broken into, he never 
leaves home without a canister of tear-gas spray, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear of Crime 
</P>
<P>
"There's an absolute epidemic of crime here," he said. "I'm looking for a 
forgotten area, a place like Appalachia or something, a place that people don't 
even think or read about." 
</P>
<P>
Seavey, a Pasadena native, became interested in relocation trends while living 
in central Oregon for several years. He said he has mailed information about 
moving to rural areas to as many as 30,000 people since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But few of those people, Seavey said, have kept in touch with him, so he does 
not know how effective his advice has been. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I've helped people move," he said. "But I don't get glowing letters 
back saying: 'Thanks, we're having a wonderful time in our new environment.' "

COVERAGE OF THE ABORTION ISSUE IN TUSTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your (July 9) article regarding the rescue in Tustin was clearly biased against 
Operation Rescue. You, and many others, persist in calling Operation Rescue 
militant. According to Webster, "militant" means "engaged in warfare" or 
"aggressively active." Neither is true of Operation Rescue. Singing, praying, 
sitting and going limp cannot be construed as aggressive by any stretch of the 
definition. 
</P>
<P>
You also called the demonstration "boisterous" and said the two sides "taunted 
one another." Having participated in two rescues myself, I find this hard to 
believe. Operation Rescue strongly recommends that rescuers be quiet and 
prayerful (as evidenced by your own photos). I have never seen one of them be

Concerning the Orange County Transportation Commission refusing to buy Southern

a hike in the sales tax in November (June 24): 
</P>
<P>
How dare the commission hold the Orange County Transit District and the voters 
hostage! We need the proposed light rail that will be built on the right of 
way. It will run from Santa Ana to Buena Park, feed into rail systems in Los 
Angeles County and lessen the congestion on the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The voters should defeat the tax increase just to teach the commission a 
lesson!

RECYCLING REFUSE FROM HOUSEHOLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My cleaning lady, a longtime family friend, and I are responsible for recycling 
everything possible in this household and the apartment complex. On her 
biweekly visits, all sacked newspapers, aluminum cans, glass bottles and 
plastic bottles are collected. The newspapers are donated to her church and 
everything else she sells to Santa Ana Recycling Centers. She uses all small 
glass jars for canning jams, jellies and fruits and vegetables, and I am lucky 
enough that some come back full. 
</P>
<P>
As I dump my trash, I always fill up the waste basket at the dumpster with 
recyclable materials. From my long experience at this large apartment complex, 
practically no one recycles. This is a tremendous waste and an unnecessary cost 
to the taxpayer on landfill dump fees. There is room at the rear on the 
sidewalk for one large recycling bin. Let everyone put everything recyclable 
into this one bin and the city can sort it out upon collection. 
</P>
<P>
Make it simple to recycle at apartment complexes, such as this one, and you 
will have a great success. I would estimate that a third of the contents of the 
dumpsters were recyclable materials.

THE CARWASH AND THE DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to my May 27 letter, Richard Shedenhelm (Letters, June 17) says 
"profitability should determine land use," and adds that my call for a 
moratorium on the corner of Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards, where a 
developer wants to level the neighborhood's carwash, service station and coffee 
shop to build an upscale two-story retail complex, is politically dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
I take that to mean that my call for Councilman Joel Wachs to protect the 
present site to "allow us time to meet (with the developer) and discuss the 
alternatives to total destruction" is a threat to the political freedoms of 
this land. Hardly. What is politically dangerous, however, are untrue 
statements made by overzealous, uninformed and ignorant developer sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
The members of this community want all developers to make a profit and be 
successful. Our concerns are exactly the words of Shedenhelm: "The 
entrepreneurs who fail to accurately forecast the wants of consumers sustain 
losses." 
</P>
<P>
Shedenhelm states that I am in fact substituting my personal preferences over 
that of my neighbors. Where was Shedenhelm during rallies attended by members 
of the Briarcliff Improvement Assn., the Studio City Residents Assn. and the 
Studio City Chamber of Commerce -- who all oppose removal of existing 
improvements? 
</P>
<P>
He states that market forces of profit and loss should be the only 
considerations in determining the viability of a development, and infers that I 
am against an "owner's inalienable right to peacefully use his property as he 
himself determines." Read my letter again, Mr. Shedenhelm. I supported owners' 
rights to redevelop, but not freely when there is strong opposition from 
consumers and residents. 
</P>
<P>
When some developers are allowed to proceed with redevelopment plans without 
considering the desires and needs of the surrounding community, it is 
commercially dangerous. One Studio City retail project was allowed to proceed 
over the protests of the neighborhood residents. Today it remains only 
partially occupied, and this community is stuck with it.

ASSESSING THE RECORD OF IRVINE MAYOR AGRAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fortunately, other citizens of Irvine as well as Mayor Larry Agran (July 10) 
are able to see the hypocrisy in using pseudopatriotism and religion to hide an 
inability to deal with problems or mask bigotry. That's why the citizens have 
always elected Agran by such overwhelming margins. 
</P>
<P>
We have found that few local issues are solved by Republican or Democratic 
solutions. In Irvine, with a City Council that listens to the community and 
solves problems with a pragmatic approach, we feel we are retaining a high 
quality of life, a safe environment for our children and protecting the value 
of our homes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts to misrepresent Agran's view on growth and roads, the facts are 
clear to anyone who will objectively look at his voting record since 1978. 
Agran is for planned growth, but growth that is done with community input. 
</P>
<P>
An example would be the reduction of traffic within our village associations 
while at the same time widening those streets that do not dissect our 
individual villages. These changes were made after detailed studies that 
involved traffic experts and residents. The response of the Board of 
Supervisors to these changes was to pull our transportation funds. The citizens 
can see through this political ploy. One only has to drive down Lake Street in 
Huntington Beach where the entire street has been replaced with houses to 
realize who is improving roadways. Of course, this "unplanned" growth pattern 
is more in keeping with that of the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
It should be obvious that Orange County has only two effective legislators -- 
John Seymour and Marian Bergeson -- and because of this, our county suffers. 
</P>
<P>
If more Orange County residents would look beyond the misleading labels and 
elect more people with intelligence and integrity like Larry Agran, we would be 
on the way toward solving our pressing needs.

GOVERNOR VETOES FUNDS FOR PARKLANDS

Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed from the state's 1989-90 budget a $3-million 
appropriation for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to acquire land near 
Malibu Creek State Park and in the Santa Susana Mountains. In his veto message 
last week, Deukmejian said there were insufficient funds from a 1984 parkland 
bond act to make the purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director, said the organization 
would seek funds from other state sources for the land purchases. "I think we

A GOLF COURSE IN LAGUNA LAUREL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So home buyers "cherish a view of a golf course second only to an ocean view," 
this, according to The Times business section ("Orange County Plays Catch-Up on 
Golf Courses," July 9). Well, that explains it, but it doesn't justify the 
potential loss of one unique and environmentally fragile coastal region which 
is the next target for golf course community construction. I'm talking about 
Laguna Canyon and the Irvine Co.'s planned "Laguna Laurel" housing project, 
which, if it ever succeeds, would put 3,200 homes, shops and services around a 
276-acre playground for mattress magnates, or the likes thereof. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, grading and construction of the golf course, homes, offices, 
pro shops, restaurants, gas stations and stores will irreversibly destroy 
Orange County's last remaining natural and extraordinarily beautiful passage to 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
I shudder to think about the effects water and flood runoff will have upon the 
nearby ocean. The chemicals and pollutants that it will take to achieve the 
prestigious, manicured look preferred by golf course community homeowners 
(according to The Times) will undoubtedly burden an already overburdened sea. 
Not to mention the native coastal canyon animals and plants it will upset and 
destroy. Mule deer, bobcat, coyote and mountain lion aren't the golfer's 
greatest caddy companions. 
</P>
<P>
I find it appalling that with an 18-hole Monarch Beach Course just a few miles 
down the coast and, not one but two 18-hole courses under construction just a 
few miles around the corner on the Irvine Coast, the developer plans yet 
another in Laguna Canyon. That's getting bloody selfish. 
</P>
<P>
The only "open space" these county Planning Commission-sanctioned golf courses 
provide is open space for those who like to follow little hard balls around 
once-beautiful native lands. Now come on, is that really civilized?

JOURNEY INTO SPACE THE FIRST THREE DECADES OF SPACE EXPLORATION BY BRUCE MURRAY 
(W. W. NORTON: $19.95; 354 PP.; ILLUSTRATED; 0-393-02675-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Collins, Collins, a former astronaut and author of Liftoff (Grove), 
is working on his fourth book, this one about the planet Mars. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is an uncommon organization, a place that 
doubles as a part of Caltech and as an active NASA center. Over the years, some 
of the space program's most imaginative and cost-effective work has emerged 
from JPL, all involving unmanned exploration. JPL has brought us the planets -- 
sun-seared Mercury, the swirling clouds of Venus, the deserts of Mars, the 
gaseous giant Jupiter, ringed Saturn, and obscure Uranus -- and next month, 
after an incredible 12-year odyssey, a Voyager spacecraft will give us our 
first close-up look at Neptune. No one else on Earth -- certainly not the 
Soviets -- could do this. Today, 20 years after the first lunar landing, JPL 
remains a national treasure. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Murray was the director of JPL from 1976 to 1982. He is also co-founder, 
with Carl Sagan, of the 125,000-member Planetary Society. A geologist by 
education and an explorer by nature, Murray packs 30 years of planetary science 
into this readable but somewhat unbalanced account. His prose swings from that 
of seasoned bureaucrat to that of enthralled scientist, depending on how close 
he is to one of his beloved planets. Pondering the sorry state of NASA in the 
aftermath of the Challenger explosion, for example, he explains somewhat 
pompously that "the time had come for me to put into literary form that view 
from within." 
</P>
<P>
He is awe-struck, in contrast, when writing about the signals coming from 
Voyager: "(Its) faint, wailing voice as it whispers back the secrets of 
Neptune. For one marvelous moment, just as the last decade of this careening 
century begins, an invisible resonance of precisely tuned radio waves will 
vibrate across three billion miles. This sound box of the Solar System should 
provide the greatest live video of our century." 
</P>
<P>
This last quote encapsulates the book's major strength and weakness. Murray 
loves his planets and assumes everyone else does too. He explains them very 
well, and the lay reader certainly will be caught up in the beauty of these 
remote places, but he goes overboard. Neptune most definitely will not "provide 
the greatest live video of our century." I don't know what will, but Jupiter 
won't come close to Armstrong's first step on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
Given that this book's subtitle is "The First Three Decades of Space 
Exploration," it is strange that Murray skips over some big chunks of history 
and almost totally ignores manned space flight. The Gemini program is not 
mentioned, for instance; a chart of significant events jumps from John Glenn's 
Mercury to the Apollo fire that killed Grissom, White and Chaffee. Gemini was 
essential in building the foundation that allowed Apollo to reach the moon 
before John F. Kennedy's deadline of the end of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
A more accurate subtitle would be "How I Hate the Shuttle." It is certainly 
true that putting all of NASA's launch eggs in the shuttle basket was a 
fundamental mistake. The decision was made in the early 1970s, and it siphoned 
off money from the planetary program later in that decade and into the 1980s. 
Even worse, it made sure that no expendable launch vehicles would be available 
to compete with the shuttle. Then came the Challenger accident and the shuttle 
was grounded. Hence there was a long dry spell during which JPL's wonderful 
machines could not get off the launch pad. 
</P>
<P>
Murray certainly needed to explain in this book how the shuttle crimped his 
operation, but hardly a page goes by without a new diatribe, and it can get 
tiresome. He writes of "NASA's obsession with the Shuttle . . . " " . . . 
NASA's fixation on the Shuttle was such that it overrode any sense of 
responsibility for future American space science and exploration." "The Shuttle 
had always catered to the need for fantasy in us all. Now it served no other 
purpose." "Once again NASA mortgaged America's future in space in a desperate 
bid to retain the Shuttle as its means and the ill-conceived space station as 
it ends." And so on. 
</P>
<P>
For as long as I have known NASA, there has been a certain tension between its 
manned and unmanned components. Some scientists, such as James Van Allen, are 
just flat against manned exploration because a robot can generally get the job 
done a lot cheaper. One counter argument (as a former astronaut, my prejudices 
lie in this direction) is that the public's consistent support for the manned 
program helps not only NASA, but components of it, such as JPL. Murray does not 
refute this in the case of Apollo, pointing out that ". . . Viking, Voyager, 
and the Mariners . . . became a reality decades earlier than they would have if 
Apollo had not happened." But the shuttle is different, he says. 
</P>
<P>
He may be right that the shuttle has blocked a lot of brilliant planetary 
science, but what neither he nor anyone else can say is what would have 
happened to NASA without a shuttle. Extra money might have gone to JPL, but I 
doubt it. In my view Murray overestimates the public's fascination with 
planetary science. For example, he writes that when Voyager flew by Jupiter in 
1979 and photographed its gaudy atmosphere, "The swirling Red Spot became a 
cultural symbol overnight." I don't remember that. 
</P>
<P>
To the Soviets and their space program, Murray is generally kind. General 
Secretary Gorbachev is depicted as listening attentively for hours and asking 
intelligent questions of his space experts, while, over lunch, President Reagan 
tells a few jokes and then startles his guests by remarking that "one can't 
help but think about creationism" because no one has yet found life anywhere in 
the universe. To me a strange omission was not mentioning the Soviet shuttle. 
If our shuttle is such a mistake, and the Russian program as well thought out 
as he says, how do you explain their shuttle? Perhaps the Buran had not yet 
flown before Murray finished this book, but surely he knew it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Murray is more adept at criticizing than offering solutions (other 
than to give JPL more money), but he does have a strong suggestion to make 
about NASA's future: "The first human landings on Mars beckon as the next great 
milestone in human exploration, now that Earth orbit and the moon have been 
visited." The author explains the exciting science he expects to be performed 
on Mars, and why he chooses it rather than any other of the planets. Instead of 
competing Apollo-style with the Soviets, "we can go to Mars together in a 
resounding victory of human intelligence and spirit over runaway technology and 
political change." Murray believes that there is ". . . a longing for the two 
nations to do something together for a change, something on behalf of the human 
species. Our powers are so great and our accomplishments so feeble." 
</P>
<P>
In my view, Apollo was not a feeble accomplishment, but I won't quibble with 
the sentiment behind Murray's words. I agree wholeheartedly that Mars should be 
our next destination and NASA's focal point. No other space goal can revitalize 
our space agency, or contribute so mightily to the political and economic 
health of this country. The United Sates can go it alone or the two superpowers 
can form a joint venture, but it seems preferable to mount an international 
campaign and invite any country with the cash and the technology to join in. 
</P>
<P>
Murray comes through as a prickly character who says what he thinks. Apparently 
he didn't get along very well with the NASA administrators for whom he worked, 
nor did he approve of our country's leadership, at least as far as space was 
concerned. ("Jimmy Carter was too honest to mislead but too narrow to lead.") 
But Murray understands why he was considered a maverick; and when one of his 
NASA bosses tells him "I don't trust you, Bruce" he cheerfully explains to the 
reader why not. Most writers would not include such a passage. 
</P>
<P>
So it is an honest book and a very good one if you are fascinated by far-off 
places with strange geology and wonderful names (Io, Europa, Ganymede, 
Callisto). Or if you are interested in the sophisticated robotic machines that 
visited these planets and moons, and the brilliant people at JPL who milked the 
last drop of scientific information from them.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: CULTURES IN CONFLICT BY URS BITTERLI (STANFORD UNIVERSITY 
PRESS: $34.50; 215 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONJA BOLLE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The work of a prominent Swiss cultural historian, "Cultures in Conflict" seeks 
to transform the history of colonialism into cultural history by representing 
the mental structures or world view of the actors on both sides, explorers and 
indigenous peoples. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing on the voluminous literature on voyages and colonization roughly from 
the middle of the 16th through the 19th centuries, Urs Bitterli classifies the 
types of encounters between Europeans and "others." His system proposes three 
categories. The first type of encounter is "contact" -- what Europeans do when 
they see natives and what natives do when they first see Europeans. Such a 
model of mutual ignorance allows both (from the historians' point of view) to 
make mistakes and arrive at misconceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Bitterli mentions the creation story told by the Cherokee and their neighbors, 
which grew up in response to cultural conflict: God created men by taking three 
pieces of dough, molding them into a human shape and baking them in an oven. 
The first man, incorrigibly impatient, demanded to be removed prematurely, and 
was consequently undercooked and pale; from him are descended the white men. 
The second figure, nicely browned, was the ancestor of the Indians. God's 
delight in this figure made him forget the third, who remained in the oven and 
burned. This figure was the ancestor of the black men. 
</P>
<P>
This myth, Bitterli contends, is the result of the second type of cultural 
encounter, "collision," in which the colonized feel that they have got the 
short end of the stick and revolt. These revolts in turn are brutally 
suppressed. An example is the Spanish colonization of Hispaniola (latter-day 
Haiti and Dominican Republic). 
</P>
<P>
The third type of contact is "relationship," examples of which are William Penn 
and the English Quakers in Pennsylvania and the French Jesuit missionaries in 
Canada. In this model, the Europeans study the natives carefully and manage to 
live in relative peace with them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems with Bitterli's classification system is that it does not 
cover even all the encounters described in the book. It is unclear, for 
example, into which category the Australian and South Pacific explorations 
fall. Second, what does Bitterli's typology contribute to our understanding of 
the works of writers like the Jesuit Father Le Jeune, who wrote extensively on 
the Iroquois? 
</P>
<P>
Third and most important, given the later history of colonization, many readers 
will find it offensive to draw distinctions between the various types of 
encounters in North America, for example. The peaceable efforts of the Quakers 
and Jesuits were exceptions rather than the rule; the violent events in 
Hispaniola have been called by historian Pierre Chaunu a "microcosm of the 
entire history of America." A comprehensive account of colonialism, taking into 
account the perceptions from either side, would be valuable. This, however, 
Bitterli does not accomplish with his categories.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE EARTH IS ENOUGH GROWING UP IN A WORLD OF TROUT AND OLD

<P>
Harry Middleton's vivid and moving memoir is part autobiography and part homage 
to the two old men who taught him to love the outdoors. In a few brief but sure 
strokes, Middleton sketches his family circumstances, with a stunning 
description of a tough military father. Near the military base where 
Middleton's father is stationed on Okinawa, one of the author's schoolmates is 
killed by an old hand grenade the boys find in a creek bed. The young Middleton 
is immediately packed off to live with his grandfather and granduncle on the 
family farm in the foothills of the Ozarks. On the bus trip across the States, 
the boy fears he is being "handed over to tobacco-chewing, brain-damaged 
hillbillies." 
</P>
<P>
Instead he finds two old eccentrics with whom he feels instantly at home. 
Grandfather Emerson and Uncle Albert own a tract of miserly "hardscrabble" 
land, but they revel in their wilderness of ancient, tenacious trees and wild 
game. Their lifeblood is liberty and solitude, the possibility of hunting and, 
most of all, of trout fishing in Starlight Creek. The old men raise vegetables 
but no animals because, whereas tomatoes are never in a hurry, animals have a 
habit of requiring attention just when the "trout were rising or something more 
interesting or illuminating was happening up in the mountains or deep in the 
woods." 
</P>
<P>
The farm is in fact so unproductive that a state agricultural agent calls it 
"an agricultural disgrace." The scene with the agent, in which the old men can 
barely conceal their pride at having kept the land so wild and pristine, 
contains their whole philosophy. In answer to the agent's advice to cut down 
the useless trees and plant valuable pines, Emerson protests: "Certainly the 
world isn't experiencing a shortage of telephone poles." Instead he asks for 
advice on how to preserve the trout's environment. Trout are "finicky, 
civilization upsets them. They'd rather die than have any part of it." Albert 
then invites the fellow to go fishing in a perfect place where there's a sly 
old trout, adding: "Of course, if you hook him we expect you to do the decent 
thing and let him go. If a man is careful and lucky, some of life's thrills can 
be experienced more than once." As the agent withdraws in fury, he rebukes 
them: "Goddamn old hippie communists. Men your age, too. You ought to be 
ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
In the old farm house that "tended to embrace the practical rather than the 
needless, the theoretical, dispensable or the visionary," there are no modern 
conveniences except a radio, so that Albert can play his Hohner harmonica along 
with a weekly blues program from Memphis. Another indispensable item in their 
life is books: hundreds of them. In the evenings and in foul weather, the old 
men attend Roman orators, converse with Mark Twain, are aggravated by Evelyn 
Waugh. When it appears that the young Middleton is bitten as hard by the bug of 
writing as of fishing, they build him a desk, and eventually, a chair, 
straight-backed and plain like everything else in the house. "No writer writes, 
I hear tell," says Emerson, "unless he's uncomfortable with something, even if 
it's just a chair."

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: RUNNING THE AMAZON BY JOE KANE (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 
278 PP.)

Adventurer Joe Kane tells the story of the first expedition to run the entire 
length of the Earth's longest river, 4,200 miles from high in the Andes 
Mountains almost at the Pacific Coast across Brazil to the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, ten people -- nine men and a woman from various countries -- set out 
on the journey, brought together through several sponsors and for various 
reasons: scientific interest, filmic possibilities, reckless enthusiasm or 
habitual addiction to adventure. The group's first challenge was finding the 
source of the river, a goal that has obsessed explorers from the time of the 
Spaniards. Kane weaves the history and legend of the South American interior 
into his text, as well as comments on the current situation ("In the four 
centuries since Pizarro's butchery the Colca valley has regained a delicate 
equilibrium, though it is not nearly as productive as it once was. Now there is 
also a new joker in the deck, the $900 million Majes project, which, if ever 
completed, will pump Andean water westward over the mountains into Peru's 
coastal plain"). 
</P>
<P>
Their starting point located, the travelers set out in kayaks, and the trip 
begins in earnest. The Polish participant "each day prepared himself as if for 
combat. . . . He carefully applied a combination of lotions and sunscreens that 
looked exactly like war paint." And combat it is. As the river becomes 
increasingly wild, the group breaks into those who run the rapids and those who 
elect to portage. Each day's run is a dramatic tale: "Though it was midday, no 
sun reached the water. The river itself was a mess -- fast, mud brown, roiling 
from the rain and still rising, studded with boulders that towered over our 
little fleet. This was the Acomamba Abyss." Along the way there are the 
inevitable near-disasters, discomforts and triumphs. Kane carries off a 
terrific adventure story, a torrent of stories from the first dusty road to the 
final champagne drunk at the Atlantic.

<P>
Julia, I bring 
</P>
<P>
To thee this ring, 
</P>
<P>
Made for thy finger fit; 
</P>
<P>
To show by this 
</P>
<P>
That love is 
</P>
<P>
Or should be, like to it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loose though it be,

<P>
The joint is free;

<P>
So, when love's yoke is on, 
</P>
<P>
It must not gall, 
</P>
<P>
Nor fret at all, 
</P>
<P>
With hard oppression. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
But it must play,

<P>
Still either way,

And be, too, such a yoke

As not too wide

JUNG'S WARNING TO WEIMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was appalled at the innuendo and falsity in Russell Jacoby's characterization 
of Jung and Jungians in the course of his review of Jerome Bernstein's "Power 
and Politics" (Book Review, July 2). First, Jung read the Zurich newspaper 
every day, and had frequent and lengthy commentaries about the state of 
political realities throughout his writings. Second, the old canard linking 
Jung to Nazi sympathies was cleverly put forth in Jacoby's review, but just as 
mistaken and offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Jung did not believe that the "Jewish psyche" was inferior. He did not focus 
his psychology on "the creative Aryan unconscious" and in fact fought the 
Nazification of the psychological society of which he was president until he 
resigned. His numerous warnings about the collective psychosis that seized the 
German people were made before many people saw clearly into the nature of the 
madness that it was. His whole psychology could be said to be a way of becoming 
more individual, and thus less susceptible to totalitarianism and mass 
hysteria. Jung did not glimpse an ecstatic Wotan (a Germanic god) to be 
celebrated when he looked at Nazism. He saw civilization as a thin veneer over 
more primitive and destructive gods in the German psyche that were not brought 
to consciousness and integrated in psychologically responsible ways. 
</P>
<P>
If Jung were as Jacoby portrays him to have been, why were so many of his most 
creative followers, including the late senior analyst in Los Angeles, James 
Kirsch, Jewish? The problem with Jacoby's attack on Jung is that the false 
connection, the exasperating lie, is left in the residue of memory after the 
charges have been answered.

DON'T BLAME IT ON ISLAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Kelley's review of "The Closed Circle" (Book Review, June 18) is Arab 
bashing at its finest. Kelley states that David Pryce-Jones' book is brave, 
honest and thoughtful. I concede that it is indeed brave to publish such a 
text; Pryce-Jones made honest observations regarding common Arab behaviors that 
are unfortunately often true. 
</P>
<P>
But, he was in no way honest about the causes of this behavior and certainly 
not thoughtful when continuously blaming it on Islam. Pryce-Jones asks: "Why is 
it that representative and parliamentary institutions, protection under the 
law, individual rights and guarantees, have failed to take root in Arab soil?" 
The answer is, no Arab country is following an Islamic system of government 
true to the teachings of the Koran, which guarantees all of the above and so 
much more. If Muslim Arabs engage in lying, cheating, violence, bribery, and 
self-destructive acts, it is because they have failed to institute Islamic 
ideals. 
</P>
<P>
I must conclude with a remark about the arrogant manner in which Pryce-Jones 
compares the Western system of justice and the "Orientalists." Islamic law is 
far more "civilized" and "modern" than Western democracy. In this country, the 
Civil Rights Act could easily be overturned simply by a change in the majority 
vote of the people. In Islam, rights such as race and sex equality are 
guaranteed and are irrevocable. Thus a misinformed public cannot change certain 
unalienable rights just because they feel like it in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
If journalists would start judging religions by their content instead of their 
imperfect followers, most misinformation about Islam would vanish.

MAN-GODS IN THE MEXICAN HIGHLANDS INDIAN POWER AND COLONIAL SOCIETY, 1520-1800 
BY SERGE GRUZINSKI TRANSLATED BY EILEEN CORRIGAN (STANFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: 
$32.50; 223 PP.; 0-8047-1513-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alejandro Morales, Morales' most recent novel is The Brick People (Arte 
Publico Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The late Cuban author Alejo Carpentier stated that in the everyday reality of 
Latin America one finds myriad examples of the "marvelous real." Those cases 
where the illogical has become logical, where people are transfigured into 
animals, where myth, fact and fiction share a common ground, this is the region 
of Carpentier's the "marvelous real" and the region where French historian, 
Serge Gruzinski, found the subject of the Mexican man-gods. 
</P>
<P>
Gruzinski has taken an unorthodox, speculative, creative path away from 
classical historiography to the study of the intra-history, the popular 
culture, of the marginalized Indian population of central Mexico during 
different eras of colonial Mexico. His sources are not the official histories 
written by the well-educated nobles or clergymen of the time; instead, he 
relies on the testimonies of Indian peasants who lived at different stages of 
the colonial period and who declared themselves "man-gods" or the incarnation 
of a god or gods. These man-gods and their followers were accused of idolatry 
and witchcraft and doomed by the Inquisition. Gruzinski deconstructs these 
documents to reveal the dynamics of indigenous acculturation as Indian and 
Christian mythologies merge in the Indian's syncretic world view. 
</P>
<P>
The author analyzes four cases of man-gods: Andres Mixcoatl, 1537; Gregorio 
Juan, 1659; Juan Coatl, 1665 and Antonio Perez, 1761. Gruzinski describes their 
individual biographies, discussing the qualities that enabled these men to rise 
above the colonial repressive society and lead a subversive cultural 
resistance. The man-gods attempted to understand and overcome the profound 
changes that were crushing their society, and by overtly doing so they became 
centers of power that directly challenged the Catholic Church and the Spanish 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
Gruzinski includes the man-gods' testimonies, which offer the reader a rare 
look into Indian thinking and a critique of colonial society. Andres Mixcoatl 
describes his deification, "My name is Andres. I am a Christian. . . . I often 
preached in plain daylight at Tulancingo, Huayacocotla, Tututepec, Apan and 
many other places. It was at Tepehualco, about four years ago, that I became a 
god." Later Andres states: "In all the places where I spoke, and in many 
others, I preached to the 'macehuales' that if they did not recognize me as 
god, they would die, that I would bring down hail and frost to make them all 
perish. They ought not, therefore, to believe the friars, but rather what I 
told them. The rest was only deception." 
</P>
<P>
The juxtaposition of Gruzinski's thoroughly engaging poststructuralist analysis 
with the man-gods' actual testimonies creates in his history a quality of 
fiction. An extra dimension is Gruzinski's study in that he has captured the 
idea that in Mexico, and in Latin America in general, history and fiction 
enhance one another, that somehow history creates fiction and fiction creates 
history. This reviewer's opinion is that Gruzinski's examination of the Mexican 
past through the eyes of mystic warriors may be understood as an allegory of 
time that examines the past and the future of Mexico, not the apocalyptic 
future that Carlos Fuentes foresees, but one that holds the promise of more 
man-gods. The author puts forth Emiliano Zapata, the caudillo of the Mexican 
Revolution, and asks whether Zapata was the last man-god. 
</P>
<P>
Gruzinski has demonstrated by using concrete cases how Indian cultures 
constantly change and survive by re-creating their own traditions and how 
marginalized societies, in order to construct a new identity, create new 
syncretic cultural forms. Although at times the translation suffers from 
meandering sentences, the text is an altogether intriguing voyage with the 
man-gods, through their places, peoples and times.

GROWING UP JAPANESE-AMERICAN; 
</P>
<P>
THE FLOATING WORLD BY CYNTHIA KADOHATA (VIKING PRESS: $17.95; 196 PP.; 
0-670-82680-4) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Grace Edwards-Yearwood, Edwards-Yearwood's novel, In the Shadow of the 
Peacock, was recently published in paper by Ballantine Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Floating World," Cynthia Kadohata's first novel, centers around the Osaka 
family, part of a migratory wave of Japanese-Americans traveling through the 
Pacific Northwest searching for work in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Olivia, through whom this remarkable story is told, listens as 
her grandmother, Obasan, laments," my memories are a string of pearls and 
rocks." Obasan, who has outlived three husbands and seven lovers and who 
scandalized society as a young woman by smoking cigars when women were not even 
permitted to smoke cigarettes, complains to everyone who will listen but mainly 
to Olivia, "because she is the oldest (of the children) . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Olivia's family is in constant motion, saying goodby, packing, unpacking, 
looking ahead and wondering what the next stop will bring. Though they are on 
the move, she feels secure within the cocoon-like closeness of her family. "We 
were stable traveling through an unstable world while my father looked for 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Traveling however, in the narrow confines of the family auto and sharing one 
motel room, the girl becomes a reluctant witness to the dynamics of her 
parents' unhappy relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Osaka, whom everyone calls Charlie-O, had married Olivia's mother when 
she was seven months pregnant by another man. Just as the family seems 
unconnected to their temporary surroundings, Olivia's mother, well mannered and 
refined, appears to float in a private world of disappointment, unconnected to 
Charlie-O's love for her. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you want?" said Charlie-O very quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want anything," my mother said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't understand -- I want you to want something." 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't want you to be mad," my mother said to the window. A small steam 
circle formed on the glass where she was talking. I felt very old suddenly, 
because I knew she'd only said that for him. What she'd said first was closer 
to the truth: She didn't want anything he could give her." 
</P>
<P>
So the family remains in motion, in pursuit of equally elusive emotional and 
financial fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, while driving to visit some friends, Charlie-O said, 'should I 
make a right here?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'No,' I said. 
</P>
<P>
"He turned anyway, too sharply, and we ended up in a ditch. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Whoops, sweetie-dog,' he said. "I thought you said yes. I thought she said 
yes." 
</P>
<P>
"We sat there for several minutes, as if we'd simply come to a very long 
traffic light. Eventually Charlie-O said, 'all right,' and got out of the car, 
slipping almost immediately and falling to the ground. My mother and I got out 
to help him. He lay on the ground with his eyes open, blinking. We lifted him 
into the car, then patted down the dirt round the wheels. We weren't sure 
whether that was what we were supposed to do, but it made us feel better. I 
pushed in back with my brothers while my mother accelerated, the wheels 
whipping dirt into the air. The car didn't budge. Despite protests from my 
mother, my father got out of the car. 'Aw, I can help,' he said. He pushed with 
my brothers and me. I found myself pushing harder than before. My legs 
stretched out as I tried to get into a good position, and my cheek rested 
against the cool metal of the trunk. The effort took me over, and I realized 
how badly I wanted my father to be able to say later that he helped get us out 
of that ditch. I thought that would help the marriage somehow. But it was no 
good. The car remained stuck. Finally my mother and I found a house, and a man 
came to help us. My mother took over the driving." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout their travels, Olivia, her mother, and her stepfather remain caught 
up in this heartbreaking tug-of-love. 
</P>
<P>
Before settling in Arkansas where Charlie-O buys into a garage business, their 
search takes them through Oregon, Washington, Wyoming and California. They 
travel lightly, taking care not to offend as they traverse a post- World War II 
landscape pockmarked by memories of midnight arrests and mass internments. 
</P>
<P>
They act politely, smiling at strangers: " 'Smile at them,' my grandmother 
would say. 'Hakujin (white people) don't know when a smile is an insult.' She 
always said her experience showed that if you hated white people, they would 
just hate you back, and nothing would change in the world; and if you didn't 
hate them after the way they treated you, you would end up hating yourself, and 
nothing would change that way either. So it was no good not to hate them. So 
nothing changed." 
</P>
<P>
As the family moves, Kadohata skillfully draws us into Olivia's world by 
allowing us to see through her eyes "a pet camel in someone's back yard, or a 
set of elderly twins dressed the same way down to their canes." 
</P>
<P>
We see the dimensions of small towns when she says, "I like the downtowns best, 
the way the neon and shadows cut into each other when the streets are empty." 
</P>
<P>
And the landscape assumes a surreal aspect ". . . when cars went by, far away, 
the beams were so bright they seemed to be ropes of light pulling the cars 
behind . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
On the road, Olivia learns how her great-grandparents in Hawaii were forced by 
the local school- board to give their children American names so that "today, 
their original names are just shadows following them." 
</P>
<P>
Olivia's coming of age is convincingly detailed and her adolescent dreams are 
rendered with such tenderness that her sexual awakening only seems to enhance 
her innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Kadohata's prose also renders scenes of horror and loss: Olivia, now a young 
woman living in California with her boyfriend, notices ". . . there was an 
influx of Chinese refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia around the time Andy and I 
moved, and the children all played outside until bedtime. Our first year there, 
a mass murderer was loose in Los Angeles, and the children stopped playing 
outside for a while. The murderer had strangled someone across the street and 
his presence hung like fine dust over the rows of stucco apartments and rooming 
houses in the neighborhood. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
At the beach with a party of friends, she observes ". . . a boat apparently 
stuck on a sandbar, sat near shore. Several times during the afternoon someone 
swam out to explore . . . so I swam out to the boat. I could smell it as I 
neared, a moldy, old, sad smell. On deck, the floor was damp and blackened, the 
steering wheel corroded. A plastic flag whipped in the wind. For a moment I 
stared at the flag, the only moving thing except for myself on board. I gasped 
when I saw a pair of children's shoes hanging from a nail -- I thought they 
were feet hanging down. Inside the shoes I found a damp pair of socks wrapped 
around two quarters, a nickel, a penny. The boat jolted with each wave. The 
shoes had an eeriness about them, and it didn't surprise me that none of the 
afternoon's explorers had taken the money. I got the feeling the shoes' owner 
had passed away; and out of respect for him or her, I rewrapped the coins and 
replaced them. There was something about the care with which the socks were 
wrapped that indicated a conscientious, serious child; also, something about 
the 56 cents touched me, for at one time I believed that pennies could buy a 
great deal and so deserved to be wrapped carefully. . . ."

Kadohata writes compellingly of Olivia's coming of age, her determination to 
grow beyond her parents' dreams; and break free, or at least outdistance, the 
yoke of guilt bequeathed by Obasan's death. We feel the poignancy of 
Charlie-O's fumbling search for a meaning to his personal chaos, his need for a 
moral order to still the shifting sand beneath his feet. And filtering through 
these small personal struggles looms the larger one of a people trying to find 
a workable niche in an alien, sometimes hostile, environment 
</P>
<P>
As Obasan notes, memory is indeed a string of pearls and rocks, but Kadohata's 
imagery makes the pearls shine and the rocks glow.

BLOODY SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mystery writers are often so prolific one name isn't enough. Erle Stanley 
Gardner was also A. A. Fair; John Dickson Carr was also Carter Dickson. Barbara 
Nickolae is a Southern California writer who has previously been Nickolae 
Gerstner and Barbara Pronin, which internal evidence suggests is her real name. 
Under any byline, her new Finders Keepers is an unusually expert and clever 
work. Its plotting, while highly improbable in real-world terms, is ingenious, 
eminently readable and suspenseful. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is the Monterey Peninsula. Shannon Buchanan, a young single mother, 
homeless except for her battered car, is arrested and charged with kidnaping. 
The cops say the golden 3-year-old she knows is her daughter is in fact a child 
she kidnaped outside a San Diego store a year before. 
</P>
<P>
The mother's story is shaky. She's made an itinerant living as a waitress and 
sidewalk portrait artist, earning just enough to support herself and young 
Mandy. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Phil Tewkes is moved by Buchanan's anguish. Then again, the San Diego 
parents are sure Mandy is their lost Suzanne. And there seems to be a death 
certificate for the child Buchanan gave birth to. The ambitious district 
attorney and his smooth political aide see the conspicuous case as a nice boost 
toward the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
The book has begun with the murder of a woman, and now a body turns up in 
Monterey Bay. It is linked to the case; the author is drawing in the strands of 
her intricate plot. Buchanan is clearly victim not perpetrator, which makes the 
circumstances of her arrest the more mysterious. 
</P>
<P>
Nickolae's unfolding of the complicated back-story is very skillfully handled, 
and the climax -- with its nicely concealed switch -- is grand theater. 
Whatever the artifices of plot, the emotions of mothers and child and entirely 
credible. An admirable debut. 
</P>
<P>
"John Sandford" is said to be the pseudonym of a Pulitzer Prize-winning 
journalist, whose habitat, at a wild guess, is the Minnesota-St. Paul area, 
where Rules of Prey is set. 
</P>
<P>
The ingredients are familiar enough: a cat-and-mouse game between a crazily 
smart serial killer and the detective who is trying to nail him. The detective 
is a womanizing bachelor who drives a Porsche, being rich from inventing 
computer games. He's also in constant trouble for killing people (five notches 
so far) in line of duty. Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood rolled into one, 
you'd have to say. 
</P>
<P>
The killer leaves provocative notes on the bodies ("Never carry a weapon after 
it has been used," for example). He's a mild-mannered lawyer, the source of 
whose mania is never really clear except that he seems to be a 97-pound 
weakling who never got in shape. 
</P>
<P>
There is a love interest. Several, actually, including an intended victim who 
got away from the killer, and a television reporter who never heard of 
off-the-record. (On the other hand the detective hands out false information 
without a tremor of guilt.) 
</P>
<P>
Sandford orchestrates the two men's parry-and-thrust with rising tension. The 
killer escapes one trap in a vivid tragical-comical burst of action. The last 
pursuit, colored by a heavy overlay of cynicism, is a rousing cap to a sleek 
production that is a Book-of-the-Month main choice, and seems hand-tailored for 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever her regrets about the singing career that was not to be, Margaret 
Truman has become a first-rate mystery writer. Murder at the Kennedy Center is 
her eighth. Like the others, including the excellent "Murder at the CIA" in 
1987, the new one draws on an I-was-there expertise that makes the Washington 
political scene clang with credibility. 
</P>
<P>
It's presidential nomination time in an unstated near-future year. One of the 
leading Democratic hopefuls, Ken Ewald, is enjoying a gala televised 
fund-raiser at the Kennedy Center. Afterward, a sexy campaign staffer is found 
shot to death in the shrubbery outside. 
</P>
<P>
McKensie Smith, a campaign adviser retired from law practice to teach at 
Georgetown, is dragooned into defending the candidate's son, who is the chief 
suspect. (It was Ewald's gun, and the son had been sleeping with the victim.) 
But nothing, thankfully, is simple. Political espionage, betrayal, blackmail, a 
corn-pone Southern rival, a television evangelist, an opera singer and agents 
of a Panamanian strongman named Morales are all on view. The proceedings are 
well-paced, colorful and entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
Truman, who took some sharp jabs at the CIA last time, is in "Murder at the 
Kennedy Center" having a trenchant say about the difference between the 
practical politics of compromise and a corrupting cynicism whose only goal is 
power. The Truman book is a Literary Guild main selection. 
</P>
<P>
The clubs are manifestly discovering that crime pays. The profitability may be 
explained partly by the huge success of television's "Murder, She Wrote" and 
the enchanting Angela Lansbury as mystery-writer Jessica Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
Art has now imitated art. Gin and Daggers, as by Jessica Fletcher and Donald 
Bain, is the first of what promises or threatens to be a series of new 
mysteries (apparently not novelizations of show scripts) starring Fletcher as 
first-person narrator. 
</P>
<P>
The setting of "Gin and Daggers" is London and the English country house. 
Jessica, abroad to address a mystery writer's conference, spends a weekend with 
a grande dame, an Agatha Christie-like figure who is found dead, and not by her 
own hand either. Her last book hadn't sounded like her at all. 
</P>
<P>
Suspects include a sullen protege and the author's niece, among others. At its 
least successful, the book struggles to pay obeisance to the show by having 
Fletcher's pals, including the sheriff, from Cabot Cove, fly in unannounced to 
help her. The book is a cut above most novelizations but well shy of Ruth 
Rendell terrain: a tightly focused fan work. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Fleming wrote as a hedonist who prospered by dramatizing a life's worth of 
fantasies -- acquisitions, indulgences, guilt-free sex and violence. John 
Gardner writes in Win, Lose or Die as a military affairs reporter who describes 
the operations of a Harrier VTOL aircraft as lovingly as Fleming described 
Pussy Galore. Gardner is long on facts, short on feelings. 
</P>
<P>
This is the eighth of the counterfeit James Bonds by Gardner, who is no kin 
stylistically or otherwise to the late American writer of the same name. Bond 
is back on Navy duty aboard a ship where Bush, Gorbachev and Thatcher are to 
hold arms-reduction talks. M, and possibly Q and R, know that there is to be a 
terrorist attack on the ship with the aim of holding the three world leaders 
for several zillion dollars in ransom. The terrorizing group, BAST, is a 
private enterprise of generally Middle Eastern persuasion but no known 
theological ties. Its leader, who intends to dispose of practically everyone, 
is as colorless a supervillain as ever Bond has faced. Call him Drabfinger. 
</P>
<P>
Bond couples predictably if distractedly with three ladies, two of them are 
wiped out almost instantly. He does a commendable dogfight with one of the 
terrorist's minions in a matching Harrier. But it is all so unamusing and 
juicelessly programmatic. The persistence of the series, despite these pallid 
copyings, is the ultimate tribute to the richness of Fleming's original 
invention.

Peary fails to identify the special qualities that earn a film a cult following 
-- as opposed to critical or box-office success. The 150 movies he discusses in 
these two volumes include some of the best Hollywood films ("Citizen Kane," 
"The Wizard of Oz," "Singin' in the Rain"), foreign classics ("Children of 
Paradise," "Beauty and the Beast," "The Seventh Seal") and an assortment of 
camp curiosities, some of which enjoy genuine cult status ("The Rocky Horror 
Picture Show," "Pink Flamingos," "Mommy Dearest"). 
</P>
<P>
Viewers looking for a more interesting video than "Working Girl" might want to 
browse through a copy of "Cult Movies" for suggestions, but they'll probably 
leave it in the bookstore. It's hard to imagine anyone sitting down and reading 
these pedestrian commentaries. To a field already overloaded with fluff, Peary 
brings precious little.

ENDPAPERS: PROTECTING THE SHOULDERS WE STAND ON 
</P>

<P>
To the uninitiated, copyright law seems the domain of only high-priced lawyers 
and best-selling authors. Yet this wide-reaching law affects everyone who 
writes, publishes, sells, buys or even reads a protected work. Authors and 
publishers praise copyright for fostering creativity and encouraging 
publication, but it also limits the utility of protected works and constrains 
public access to information. 
</P>
<P>
Copyright extends to art, motion pictures and computer software, but books and 
magazines remain at the center of legal and philosophical clashes. Last April, 
a group of publishers stirred these debates anew by suing Kinko's Graphics 
Corp., alleging that book excerpts copied and sold to students at the request 
of university faculty violated copyright. The law expressly allows multiple 
photocopies for classroom use, although the amount of copying within this 
public privilege of "fair use" is amorphous at best. 
</P>
<P>
Copyright grants exclusive rights of reproduction and distribution to authors, 
who often assign them to publishers. The rights are exclusive, but not 
comprehensive. Readers may still buy and sell books and check them out at 
libraries, and "fair use" allows the public to quote and copy protected works 
within "reasonable" limits. Authors' rights and public rights are not found in 
nature; they are established by act of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
After two decades of debates, hearings and reports, Congress passed the current 
copyright act in 1976. For the first time, fair use had changed from a judicial 
doctrine for dismissing small or socially beneficial infringements to a 
statutory provision. Authors and publishers feared that fair use would 
undermine their survival. Copyright, they argued, was their source of economic 
livelihood and the wellspring of creative energies. Educators, researchers and 
librarians, however, asserted that fair use was paramount to their success and 
growth. Reasonable amounts of materials must be photocopied and quoted, they 
contended, for effective teaching and research and for the advancement of 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Congress largely accepted the latter argument, reaffirming fair use for such 
purposes as teaching, research, criticism and news reporting. Yet the scope of 
permitted use remains unclear. All circumstances must be evaluated together, 
particularly the purpose of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the 
amount and substantiality of use and its effect on the potential market for or 
value of the original work. The law gives only these general factors; nowhere 
does it set exact limits. Fair use is instead an inherently flexible "rule of 
reason" to be determined by the circumstances of each case. 
</P>
<P>
The key argument for fair use lies in the Constitution, which empowers Congress 
to "promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited 
times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings 
and discoveries." Exclusive rights may encourage authors, but limits on those 
rights promote further progress by the public. The words of Isaac Newton from 
1675 may well apply to copyright: "If I have seen further (than others) it is 
by standing upon the shoulders of Giants." Fair use allows us to stand on 
shoulders, although not for a free ride. Copying should not substitute for 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Fair use is most important for education. The law favors nonprofit uses over 
commercial purposes, and educators "promote progress" in keeping with the 
Constitution. American campuses are also centers of extensive photocopying for 
research, study and classroom distributions -- the basis of the Kinko's suit. 
The distinction between fair use and "free ride" for academia engenders 
sophisticated and mysterious battles, usually among faculty, administrators, 
legal counsel and librarians. Rarely do clashes erupt into lawsuits with 
publishers. 
</P>
<P>
The complexities of copyright for education have precluded clear rules and 
absolute limits. Publishers insist that all photocopying for teaching and 
research should adhere to one of two procedures: Either obtain permission from 
the copyright owner, or stay within prescribed fair use guidelines. But these 
seemingly simple alternative often fail. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with the first alternative (obtain permission), teachers complain, 
is that requests for permission go unanswered or require high royalty fees. The 
Copyright Clearance Center, which does not acknowledge Fair Use, collects fees 
and instantly grants photocopying rights on behalf of thousands of publishers. 
Unfortunately, fees of a few dollars per copy compound for large classes of 
students. Another problem with the first alternative is that classroom needs 
must be met on short deadlines, leaving too little time for formalities. Some 
publishers respond to this objection by allowing copies of recent materials -- 
such as a short article from today's newspaper -- while insisting on the 
formalities for less time-bound materials. 
</P>
<P>
As for the second alternative (stay within Fair Use guidelines), many find it 
more problematic still. Developed jointly by representatives of authors, 
publishers and educators, the guidelines first appeared in a congressional 
report accompanying the 1976 Act. These standards interpret Fair Use to allow 
single copies of articles, book chapters and other short works for research or 
teaching. Multiple copies for classroom uses must meet elaborate and rigid 
rules and be confined to fewer than 2,500 words from an article, with 
privileges further dependent on the number of authors, the immediacy of the 
need, and the overall frequency of copying. Full compliance requires teachers 
to document every word, author and instance of duplication. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines have been attacked then and now as unrealistic for higher 
education, but they were virtually the sole explanation of Fair Use, and the 
congressional report gave them the imprimatur of law. The guidelines received 
an enormous boost in 1983 when New York University adopted them to settle a 
suit much like the current Kinko's case. Publishers had sued NYU, several 
faculty members and a commercial copy shop for excess photocopying. 
</P>
<P>
Through legal strategies and effective publicity, many academics now follow the 
Fair Use guidelines. Publishers' efforts this year include the Kinko's suit and 
a booklet titled, "Questions and Answers on Copyright for the Campus 
Community," prepared jointly by the Assn. of American Publishers and the 
National Assn. of College Stores. The booklet reiterates the guidelines but 
declines to assure that they offer shelter from liability. For example, the 
guidelines allow single copies for personal use, but the booklet stipulates: 
"There is no automatic exception for making even one unauthorized personal copy 
of a copyrighted work." The booklet ultimately seems to retreat from Fair Use, 
urging users to seek permissions instead. If the publishers do not firmly 
endorse Fair Use under some set of guidelines, who else will? 
</P>
<P>
Copyright owners have legitimate and serious concerns in an era of cheap and 
convenient photocopies, but the public must protect its rights of Fair Use with 
equal vigilance. Congress established Fair Use as a flexible rule of reason; 
the guidelines convert the law into quantitative mandates. Congress allowed 
multiple copies for classroom distribution and left the amount of copying to 
overall circumstances; the guidelines displace those conditions with word 
counts and exact parameters. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines are not law. They were not enacted by Congress, and no court has 
read them into Fair Use. NYU follows the guidelines by a voluntary settlement 
not binding on anyone else. Yet, whether through convenience, apprehension, 
lack of alternatives or effective persuasion, many colleges and universities 
have adopted the quantitative standards as their official policy. Copyright 
standards do more than avoid liability. They directly affect teaching and 
research, and thus affect the growth of knowledge, the exchange of ideas, and 
the progress of creativity. Our campuses support these missions, but they often 
lose sight of copyright's role in the equation. Everyone should respect 
protections. Everyone should also resist the erosion of Fair Use.

STAGE WEEK : OLD AND NEW FARE FOR PCPA ANNIVERSARY

Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts' Theaterfest celebrates its 25th 
anniversary this year -- in Solvang and Santa Maria -- with a summer-long 
program of old and new fare. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The Fantasticks' was our very first musical, 'A Man for All Seasons' our 
first play and 'Fiddler on the Roof' our audience's most beloved and requested 
show," said artistic director Jack Shouse of the three reprises. Also on this 
summer's lineup: "The Nerd" by the late Larry Shue (author of "The Foreigner"), 
"Evita" and "Quilters." 
</P>
<P>
James Pickering, who created the role of "The Nerd" at Milwaukee Repertory 
Theatre, will reprise it at PCPA. The story finds Pickering's character making 
a birthday visit to a man whose life he saved in Vietnam. The meeting turns 
into a shambles when it looks as if the nerd will never leave. Kenneth Albers, 
who directed the original production in Milwaukee, will repeat his duties here. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nerd" and "Evita" are already on the boards, with "The Fantasticks" 
opening Thursday and "Fiddler" and "A Man For All Seasons" on the July 27. "A 
lot of people from Los Angeles see our work in Solvang," noted Shouse, who'll 
spend the next months shuttling between the Solvang and Santa Maria sites. "We 
primarily service the central coast. But in the summer, our audiences come from 
all over the state." 
</P>
<P>
THEATER FILE: Feb. 21 will be the opening night for that six-week engagement of 
Andrew Lloyd Webber's roller-skating spectacular, "Starlight Express" at the 
Pantages, part of its previously announced spin through the Southland. It will 
play San Diego first, opening at the San Diego Civic Theatre Dec. 26 . . . 
Chazz Palminteri's one-man show, "A Bronx Tale" has extended -- again -- at 
Theatre West. It will play through Aug. 27, before heading for a run at New 
York's Cherry Lane Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, the International City Theatre season continues Aug. 4 with 
"Autumn Elegy," Charlene Reddick's story of a 50-years married couple facing 
cancer. Deborah LaVine directs . . . Charles Lanyer has the title role in 
Thomas F. Bradac's staging of "Cyrano de Bergerac," opening July 22 at the 
Grove Shakespeare Festival. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Theatre Center is offering a new subscription package, the 
six-play "Exploring Downtown L.A." Included are pre-show hors d'oevres and 
entertainment at a string of area eateries. The cost: $96. 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSS FIRE: "Romeo and Juliet" is enjoying a popular summer in 
productions at the Grove Shakespeare Festival in Garden Grove and the Old Globe 
in San Diego. Here's what critics had to say about Richard E.T. White's San 
Diego staging. 
</P>
<P>
From Dan Sullivan in The Times: "Leaving the Old Globe, you wonder if you 
haven't see (the play) too often. Leaving the Grove, it's a new play again, 
filled with possibilities. Shakespeare is a genius or a drone, depending on his 
helpers." 
</P>
<P>
From Welton Jones in the San Diego Union: " 'Romeo and Juliet' doesn't work 
very well as a screwball comedy. Nor as a summer romp of crazy, lovable 
teen-agers. Anybody with even a casual knowledge of the play might have sensed 
as much. But with this production, White has proven it." 
</P>
<P>
Grumbled Jonathan Saville in the (San Diego) Reader: "This is a traditional -- 
which in this case means unimaginative -- staging, in which there is a paucity 
(not quite a total absence) of new ideas to illuminate familiar passages or to 
throw fresh perspectives on the actions and themes of the play." 
</P>
<P>
Said the San Diego Tribune's Bill Hagen: "White's approach to the play is 
pretty straightforward, although he does put extra emphasis on the (male) 
camaraderie . . . 'Romeo' is a play that sags when the title characters aren't 
in the forefront, which is all too evident in this sometimes-static 
production." 
</P>
<P>
And from William E. Fark in the (Escondido) Times-Advocate: "White has wisely 
chosen to leave the story in its original Renaissance setting and draw 
parallels to the present . . . Little has been cut from the manuscript to 
accommodate this modern approach, but the pace is brisk with a few dull spots. 
Even so, the play runs well over three hours."

ART NEWS: JOKER'S SLASH ACT AN ARTLESS ENDEAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Batman" may have grossed $142 million as of last week, but the movie is making 
a few enemies too. Some are indignant over a scene in which actor Jack 
Nicholson as the Joker maniacally defaces master works of Western civilization. 
</P>
<P>
Courting actress Kim Basinger who plays Batman's love interest, Nicholson 
wreaks havoc in Gotham City's Flugelheim Museum, laughing wickedly beneath his 
silk beret all the while. 
</P>
<P>
Smash! Nicholson tips over a sculpted Degas dancer with the tap of a walking 
stick. Splat! He and his goons toss cans of paint against the walls and go 
after a Rembrandt. Psssssssst! They spray-paint Gainsborough's iconic "Blue 
Boy." 
</P>
<P>
Not one official at the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical 
Gardens in San Marino, where "Blue Boy" is housed, had seen "Batman," a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
But when Ron Haver, who heads the County Museum of Art's film department, saw 
"Batman" for the first of three times, his jaw went crashing to his chest. 
Though he otherwise "loved" the film, its museum scene is "socially 
irresponsible" and sets a dangerous example, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many nuts out running around that could easily be influenced by a 
combination of a Jack Nicholson and Joker," said Haver, observing that audience 
members at one theater he attended hooted gleefully every time a painting was 
destroyed. "Anti-heroes are powerful symbols to sub-literates. Even if the 
scene arouses one person to try to emulate (the actors) and one masterpiece is 
defaced, it has done a disservice. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the movie industry make such a big thing about being socially 
responsible," continued Haver, a widely respected authority on film. "They 
don't represent premarital sex because of AIDS and they don't encourage drug 
use. But they'll take something innocuous -- or innocuous to them -- and make a 
big laughing thing out of it. And it's not. It's absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
Critics for the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Boston Globe and 
Newsweek magazine did not object to the scene. In fact, writers for the latter 
three described it as one of the Warner Brothers movie's best or liveliest 
sequences. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times' Sheila Benson sided with Haver, however. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing could keep the "orgy of slashing and splashing" from being "a true 
stomach churner. Not in today's world of indiscriminate art whackos," film 
critic Benson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, incidents of art vandalism continue to claim headlines worldwide. 
Perhaps the most infamous case involved the man who shattered part of 
Michelangelo's Pieta with a hammer in 1972. As indigenous as murals are to Los 
Angeles are the graffiti-makers who mar them. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Warner Brothers said phone calls for a comment on the issue 
made to "Batman" producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
Still, others in the art world were not bothered a bit by the "Batman" 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't find it socially irresponsible at all," said Charles Desmarais, 
director of the Laguna Art Museum. "I assume that people raised with a healthy 
attitude won't be changed by some quirky scene in a film." 
</P>
<P>
Artist Christopher Williams, whose work is included in "A Forest of Signs: Art 
in the Crisis of Representation" at the Museum of Contemporary Art, felt that 
the Joker's widespread product tampering -- he poisons cosmetics -- makes a 
more worrisome suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"That seems a lot more dangerous to me than destroying artworks," Williams 
said. "Nicholson's act of (art) vandalism was so casual really. There wasn't 
any passion or political agenda behind it. He was just waltzing through on his 
way to have tea with (Basinger's character) Vicki Vale." 
</P>
<P>
FREEDOM OF ART: The Los Angeles-based Lannan Foundation has awarded a grant to 
Washington Project for the Arts (WPA) to help present "Robert Mapplethorpe: The 
Perfect Moment," a photography exhibit to be shown at the WPA from July 21 to 
Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit was recently cancelled by the Corcoran Gallery of Art, another 
Washington museum, to avoid exacerbating a congressional battle over National 
Endowment for the Arts funding. Controversy over such federal funding had 
erupted over the exhibit, which contains some of Mapplethorpe's 
homoerotic-themed images. 
</P>
<P>
The grant "serves in part as acknowledgement of our concern with the troubling 
challenges to First Amendment rights now facing the cultural community in this 
country," said Lisa Lyons, Lannan Foundation director of art programs. Citing 
Lannan Foundation policy, Lyons would not disclose the amount of the grant. 
</P>
<P>
Neither would Philip Brookman, WPA director of programs. But he said it was one 
of two major gifts given to support the exhibit, which will cost the WPA about 
$80,000 to stage. 
</P>
<P>
The show, organized by the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of 
Pennsylvania, is scheduled for a stop at the University Art Museum at UC 
Berkeley from Jan. 17 to March 18.

AUDIENCE MEMBERS SAY PLAY HITS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was intermission at a recent performance of "Roleplay," a musical set in a 
therapy group, and outside the theater Robert Burke held center stage. In a 
gathering of audience members, he was the sole veteran of group therapy. Or at 
least he was the only one who would admit it. 
</P>
<P>
Burke, of Long Beach, was asked if the play seemed true to life. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, in that the people don't have monumental problems," he said. "They have 
daily issues. They're adjusting, they're dealing with things." 
</P>
<P>
The play, which runs through July 30 at Group Repertory Theatre in North 
Hollywood, depicts five women and their therapist. One character, a single 
mother, has difficulty making her son obey. Another is afraid to speak her mind 
to her boyfriend. Another is torn between a successful career and the needs of 
her family. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it reminds me of what I heard in group," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
That's no surprise, as the play was based in part on a women's group run by 
therapist Margaret Paul in West Los Angeles. Paul attended a recent 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I laughed my head off," she said. "Many of the incidents were right off my 
group. It was quite startling to see them." 
</P>
<P>
Another therapist who saw "Roleplay" is Jeri Darling, who practices in Encino 
and North Hollywood. She said the work illustrates one of the big advantages of 
group therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"Now there is a real need for the kind of support you can get," she said. 
"Group seems to be making a comeback. It was hot in the '60s, and in the '70s 
individual became more prominent. Groups took a step back. But today we don't 
have the extended family around that we can count on. For a lot of people, the 
group situation is the only place they can get that kind of support." 
</P>
<P>
Theater exaggerates, of course, and in "Roleplay" the group goes so far as to 
help organize a showcase for a member who wants to make a comeback as a singer. 
One woman arranges catering. Another handles decorations. Another rounds up 
audience members. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat there and wished I'd had that kind of support," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
The therapist in "Roleplay" drew mixed responses. Burke admired her and found 
it realistic that she drew truths from her clients. But therapist Paul thought 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"She was cold and she was controlling," Paul said, "and to me that does not 
make for good group. She did not role model a centered human being. Clients 
have to see that to grow and flourish." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Benster, a veteran of group, said she liked the fact that the characters 
changed slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"In group you notice that the same issues come up over and over in different 
garb," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Eager for audiences, "Roleplay" authors Doug Haverty and Adryan Russ sent a 
mailing to 50 therapists. Haverty said the mailing has drawn therapists and 
their clients. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly something is working. "Roleplay" has been extended twice at Group 
Repertory. Performances are Saturdays and Sundays at 5 p.m. "Toward 
Perestroika!" plays at the traditional 8:30 time.

PLAYING ROLES WITHIN ROLES; 
</P>
<P>
IN THERAPY AT GROUP REPERTORY THEATRE, CHARACTERS' STRUGGLES EMERGE IN MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Group therapy. The mood is edgy, tentative -- a little hopeful, a little 
combative. The psychologist eyes her five patients. Who wants to go first? 
Suddenly, one of the women opens her mouth . . . and begins to sing. 
</P>
<P>
"There are probably very few group therapies where people actually break into 
song," said Doug Haverty, whose "Roleplay" is at The Group Repertory Theatre in 
North Hollywood. (Haverty wrote the book, Adryan Russ wrote the music and they 
both wrote the lyrics.) But convention was never a consideration for this duo. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in group therapy, and I started to see the dramatic possibilities of 
re-creating that as a musical," said Russ, 46, who became pals with Haverty 
when both were classmates in the Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. "I'd begun to work on it by myself, but I was having 
a hard time, because I'm not a book writer. I write music and lyrics. Doug 
would always come up to me after I'd taken a stab at dialogue and say, 'You 
know, if you tried this. . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Haverty agreed to co-write, on the condition that -- with the 
exception of a few songs -- they'd start from scratch. It took three years to 
get their work on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideas I gave him were actually things we were doing in my own therapy," 
Russ said. One technique was role playing, in which a patient assumed the 
persona of another (for example, their mate) and had a mock confrontation with 
herself. Another technique, called "Behind My Back" had group members standing 
behind a member's back, saying things they would not say to her face. Another 
was "If You Really Loved Me," a listing exercise of crippling emotional 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Although Russ often taped her own sessions -- with the permission of the group 
-- and later transcribed them ("I need to listen to something a few times to 
understand what went on"), the characters of "Roleplay" are not carbons of her 
real-life fellow patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose some of the women in the group could think that one or two of the 
characters are based on them," Russ said. "One of them was a businesswoman like 
Liz. Another, like Sage, believed in reading cards. But that's the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
If any one person is represented on stage, Russ believes, it's her. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm in everyone. I'm like the businesswoman. I have my own editing 
business. I relate to that whole 'Do it at home, be your own boss' thing. 
Dena's a singer/songwriter. I used to make my living as a songwriter. Sage is a 
peacemaker. I was in the Peace Corps. Like Molly, I always feel that I'm fat. 
And there's that part of Chlo about never getting enough love. I think when you 
come from a very loving family -- then go out in the world and find out it's 
not always like that -- you can never get enough." 
</P>
<P>
The final judgment on therapy, she stressed, is affirmative. 
</P>
<P>
"There was another musical about group therapy some time ago, 'Walls.' When I 
saw it, it made me want to do mine even more. I didn't think it presented 
therapy in the proper light -- at least what I think it is. For me, it's a very 
positive thing. I'm a believer. And from the feedback we've gotten, it seems 
audiences are getting more from the show than just entertainment: stepping into 
other people's shoes, doing the role play, seeing things from another point of 
view." (See accompanying story.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Haverty (a member of Group Rep, where his "In My Mind's Eye" ran in 1984, with 
Russ' incidental music) is also enjoying another point of view -- as a man 
involved in what is, unarguably, a woman's story: "It's funny; I seem to be 
able to write women better than men. I grew up in a family of boys -- I have 
three younger brothers -- so women fascinate me. I study and collect them. When 
they tell me things, I remember them. All of my plays either have a female lead 
or really strong parts for women." 
</P>
<P>
(Here, he's also outnumbered: In addition to Russ and the six cast members and 
six understudies, the stage manager, choreographer, assistant director and 
director are all female.) 
</P>
<P>
Like Russ, Haverty, 36, hopes that the therapy theme is having therapeutic 
effects. "I wanted to present a subject people are either afraid of or make fun 
of -- and show it can be a rewarding thing. Adryan had a really good experience 
in group therapy. At the beginning it was scary, it was always challenging, and 
at the end she felt better. I think this is something that makes audiences 
appreciate their own lives, and shows there is still some humanity about 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
As the play moves into its 12th week (the show has been extended twice), both 
authors continue to show up each weekend (with Russ commuting from Santa 
Barbara) to work with the actresses, watch the performances and check out 
audience reaction. What next? Russ' fantasy future includes regional stagings 
on the way to an East Coast production. Haverty says he's "listening all the 
time, trying to streamline," although he admits the cuts are painful -- and 
slow. 
</P>
<P>
As an actor-turned-writer, however, he admits that the responsibility 
definitely feels good. "You get to be the parent," he said. "And when the 
audience laughs or cries, you have a sort of shared parentage." 
</P>
<P>
With due credit to the offspring. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like Adryan and I have written a good floor plan, a springboard -- and 
that these women have colored and built this incredible house," he said. "The 
life and humanity they bring is what catches audiences up, makes them feel 
good. They make the show."

NEWSMAKERS: A LESSON IN UNSELFISHNESS: PRINCIPAL EXPELS HIMSELF

Norman Najimy, principal of the only school in Richmond, Mass., taught School 
Committee members a hard lesson in altruism. In tears, they fired him for it, 
just as he had asked. The financially strapped Consolidated Elementary School 
earlier had been forced to cut another $50,000 from the budget, and Najimy 
said: "My choice was easy. Cut two teachers or can one principal." Supt. George 
St. Pierre said the selfless action will save the district more than $40,000 
and help preserve computer, lunch and basic skills programs. Najimy will stay 
for the summer to help train a teacher-principal, who will get an extra $3,000 
per year for limited supervisory duties. "This was the shortest and saddest 
meeting in our history," committee member Donna Slowick said after the 
20-minute session in which Najimy was dismissed. St. Pierre said: "Most of the 
committee was in tears, including the chairman of the board."

 -- The Iraqi government is offering a $1.6-million first prize in an effort to 
learn how water reached the high terraces of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, 
one of the ancient world's seven wonders. INA, the Iraqi news agency, said 
engineers are being asked to develop a way to water the gardens built by King 
Nebuchadnezzar without modern pumps, to keep them authentic when they are 
renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vice President Dan Quayle told the Young Republicans National Convention in 
Nashville that the anniversary was near for "Neil Armstrong and Buzz Lukens' 
walk on the moon." Astronauts Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took the first steps on 
the moon on July 20, 1969. Republican U.S. Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens, 
however, was recently sentenced to 30 days in jail after being convicted of 
having sex with a 16-year-old girl. Quayle also called for the GOP to reach out 
to blacks and other minorities. He arrived on stage after "Dixie" blared from 
the loudspeakers as noisy delegates displayed a few Confederate flags. Young 
Republican Chairman Rich Jacobs later defended the song and the flags as shows 
of regional pride. But Thomas L. Hayes, one of about 40 black delegates, said 
he was offended and blamed fringe elements of the party. "These are intelligent 
people, and they know what the Confederate flag represents," Hayes said. DAVE 
JOHNSON

DESPERATE WOMAN CALLS FOR HELP AND LEARNS HOW TO BE A MOMMY

<P>
Desperate and crying hysterically, Terri De Primo's only thought was to get 
away from her two small children for an hour or so. The day and evening had 
been a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Steven, 2, had a cold and demanded constant attention; Nikki, 4, wouldn't 
listen, was all revved up and running through the house. When bedtime came, 
neither child was able to calm down and go to sleep. And, as usual, there was 
no relief for Terri from this round-the-clock child care, no family member or 
friend she could turn to who might give her a break from her children. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at 3 a.m., Terri couldn't take it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
She stuffed some diapers into a Miss Piggy bag and shoved Steven and Nikki 
outside, locking the door behind them. "Get out! Get out!" she screamed. "You 
don't want to listen? That's fine. You take your Miss Piggy bag and you get the 
hell out of my house." 
</P>
<P>
It was dark outside, wintertime, and the children, dressed in their pajamas and 
jackets, were terrified and crying. "Mommy! Mommy! Let us in! The bogeyman's 
coming to get us!" they howled, banging on the door. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring their pleas, Terri went to an upstairs bedroom, covered her head with 
a pillow and sobbed. Confused and afraid that she might harm her children if 
she didn't get away from them for a little while, Terri had all kinds of 
thoughts racing through her mind: 
</P>
<P>
Why can't they listen to me? I love them more than anything in the world, but 
why can't they see I need a break sometimes? Why is this happening? This is 
exactly what happened to me when I was young, and I vowed when I had kids I 
would never do this to them. 
</P>
<P>
Depressed and isolated, married to a man who seldom came home, 28-year-old 
Terri had no friends, no phone, no car. The only thing in life she could count 
on was being the constant caretaker of her two preschool children. And it was 
not a role for which life had prepared her. Shunted from foster home to foster 
home since age 3, Terri knew little of what it was like to have a stable, 
secure family life. 
</P>
<P>
Terri desperately wanted to give her children what she never had. But she 
didn't have it to give; things were falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as she became aware again of her children outside, she struggled to gain 
control of her feelings. After about an hour, she went downstairs and let 
Steven and Nikki in. The two exhausted children went right to sleep. But Terri 
couldn't stop crying. By 6 a.m., she had made an important decision. 
</P>
<P>
At exactly 8 a.m., she went to a pay phone and called the group home for 
adolescent girls where she once had lived. "Call us if you ever need help," 
they had told Terri when she left. Now she dialed the number and waited. A 
voice answered at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
"Help me," sobbed Terri into the phone. "Something's not right in my family and 
I'm afraid. Life's not supposed to be like this." 
</P>
<P>
The phone call was the first step on a path that led Terri and her children to 
a smart, nurturing, 57-year-old woman named Hettie Richburg who would change 
all their lives. 
</P>
<P>
It's been five years since Richburg, then a registered nurse working at the 
Well Baby Clinic of the Baltimore City Health Department, walked into De 
Primo's life. She found her way there through her volunteer work at the 
Exchange Club Center for the Prevention of Child Abuse. The program, started 
locally in 1982, trains volunteers to work on an intensive, long-term basis 
with families displaying symptoms of abuse and neglect or those at risk of 
doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Richburg was in the program because she had seen firsthand in the clinic the 
frustration and difficulties experienced by so many mothers. And since her own 
children had grown and left the house, Richburg was feeling a bit of the "empty 
nest syndrome." So when she saw the Exchange Club ad for volunteers in the 
newspaper, she responded. 
</P>
<P>
It was a perfect match: Richburg was mature, patient and non-judgmental, just 
the type of person able to develop a trusting relationship and serve as a good 
parenting model. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'There Had Been a Crisis' 
</P>
<P>
De Primo was her first case, and Richburg was nervous when the center briefed 
her on the family's needs. "They told me she was really having a lot of 
problems and that she needed someone right away," said Richburg, settling back 
into a chair in De Primo's small, neat living room. "They told me there had 
been a crisis where she had put the children outside in the middle of the 
night. And that she had called for help." 
</P>
<P>
Richburg's first impression of De Primo remains vivid: "When I saw Terri, in my 
mind I saw this tiny, little frightened girl sitting in a corner trying to be a 
mommy. I honestly thought the kids were just going to take her over. She was 
just overwhelmed. She seemed frightened and was crying. But it was clear she 
wanted to talk. So I just sat and listened through her tears." 
</P>
<P>
Driving home hours later, Richburg found herself wondering how she was going to 
help: What have I gotten myself into, she wondered. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Richburg arrived at the De Primo house to take the children 
apple-picking. As they prepared to leave, De Primo approached shyly. "Can I go 
too?" she asked. "I think that's something I'd like." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Needed Her Childhood' 
</P>
<P>
The day was a huge success. "Terri climbed a tree and the kids were so happy," 
Richburg said. "We sat at the lake and fed ducks and it was just so much fun. 
And it didn't take me long to see that Terri really needed her childhood. I 
don't think she'd ever had one." 
</P>
<P>
De Primo was one of 10 children; her mother died when she was 2, and all the 
children were taken away from an alcoholic father and put into separate foster 
homes. "When I was growing up, I thought that everybody got beat, that 
everybody got yelled at," she said. "In this one family I lived with, I had to 
eat with the dog. I had to sit on the floor and eat with the dog. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're raised up in a world where everything is mean and everything is 
battered, that's the way you think it's supposed to be. How do you know whether 
you're right or you're wrong if you've never seen a good parent?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I met Hettie, she made me feel like I was part of something. What 
Hettie did was she listened to me. You know, she would come over, sometimes 
every day, and she made me feel like I was worth listening to. Sometimes she'd 
stay for an hour, sometimes for four hours. Sometimes she'd take us out and 
we'd spend the whole day with her. My kids loved her. They'd get up in the 
morning and it was 'Hettie, Hettie, Hettie.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Just Need You' 
</P>
<P>
But there were still bad times to get through. Richburg remembers getting a 
call in the middle of the night from De Primo. "Hettie, I need you," said De 
Primo, crying. "I don't know what for, but I just need you." 
</P>
<P>
Richburg and her husband drove to De Primo's house. Richburg put the children 
to bed and sat down with the other woman at the kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
De Primo remembers: "She made some coffee and we started talking and, just from 
her being there, I could feel all the tension going down. I knew I wasn't 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
Small moments, perhaps, but important ones. Slowly, patiently, Richburg was 
nurturing, mothering, filling in the emotional gaps for the hurt and lonely 
child who resided within De Primo. 
</P>
<P>
"My life started changing when I met Hettie," De Primo said. "She is my friend, 
my mother, the family I never had. I remember the first Thanksgiving we spent 
with her. I never went anywhere on holidays because I never had anywhere to go. 
Never. It was very depressing. Then Hettie invited us over to her house for 
Thanksgiving. And we had the best time. There must have been 30 people there, 
and everybody just made us feel so welcome." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Grandchildren 
</P>
<P>
Richburg said they are one family now: "Her kids are like my grandchildren. I 
told Steven the other day: 'Now don't you ever grow up and forget about me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Divorced now and studying accounting, De Primo finds that her life has changed 
totally. "My daughter is on the honor roll," she said. "My son still has his 
problems, but we work with them. And we have a man in our life now who's been a 
very good father image for my children. We have our ups and downs -- just like 
any other family -- but I would say my life has completely turned around." 
</P>
<P>
Zena Rudo, who directs the Exchange Club program, said that changing the 
parenting patterns in a family like De Primo's takes a "long-term commitment to 
that family. These mothers need continuing support. But you'd be surprised at 
how quickly child abuse stops when a volunteer makes that commitment and 
establishes a real, trusting relationship." 
</P>
<P>
The program has 30 active volunteers and has helped 1,450 children and their 
families since its inception seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Longer at Risk' 
</P>
<P>
"We figure we have a 95% success rate," Rudo said. "What we consider success is 
that the children are no longer at risk for child abuse and neglect, that it's 
a stable environment and that the parents use appropriate discipline and have 
good parenting skills." 
</P>
<P>
Here, however, is another way to consider success -- a moment that Richburg 
remembers with tears in her eyes: "When I first met Terri, Terri literally 
could not stand Steven. And Steven, in reaction, picked at her all the time. 
And she couldn't stand that. I tried to help her see that Steven really needed 
her love and wanted to make sure she was going to be there. And that's why he 
kept putting his hands on her. 
</P>
<P>
"But she just took it personally and thought he was trying to drive her crazy. 
Then one day -- I guess about six months after we met -- Steven came crying to 
her with some little thing and I saw Terri just reach out and wrap him in her 
arms." The voice telling the story wavered and then, as though describing a 
miracle, repeated the thought: "She just reached out and wrapped him in her 
arms." 
</P>
<P>
Richburg paused, lifting a hand to wipe her eyes: "You know," she said, "I 
still get tears when I think about it."

CASE OF MISSING BOY BECOMES TEST OF FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DUGGAN, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maurice Miles was born Oct. 3, 1986, in Baltimore, the son of an unwed mother 
who was borderline retarded and a father who peddled drugs on street corners 
before being shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was 4 months old, Maurice had been hospitalized twice with a 
broken arm, thigh, shoulder blade and shoulder socket, and a possible spinal 
cord injury. 
</P>
<P>
Even while he was immobilized in a full-body cast, according to a court 
petition, "his mother was observed throwing him into a crib on one occasion and 
shaking him profusely on another." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Returned to Mother 
</P>
<P>
The state took custody of Maurice after his second hospitalization, but he was 
returned to his mother seven months later -- despite a psychologist's report 
warning against it. 
</P>
<P>
Then he vanished. No one in authority has seen the boy for nearly two years -- 
and his mother adamantly refuses to say whether she knows where he is, for fear 
of being charged with child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Now the strange case of baby Maurice Miles has become the focus of a Supreme 
Court case that asks: Which is more important, the boy's safety or his mother's 
constitutional right not to incriminate herself? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is important, observers say, because it will help determine the 
extent of the power of juvenile courts to protect battered children in such 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The case has also prompted renewed criticism of Baltimore's troubled, state-run 
Department of Social Services. The agency was supposed to monitor Maurice's 
care by his mother, but lost track of the boy, then waited more than half a 
year before alerting the police. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore police at one point handled the matter as a possible homicide, but 
detectives could find no solid evidence that Maurice was dead. The case was 
turned over to the department's youth division and remains unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice's mother, Jacqueline Bouknight, 23, described by one of her attorneys 
as immature and "extremely limited" intellectually, has been locked in the 
Baltimore City Jail since April, 1988, for contempt of court for refusing to 
disclose his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
She has not been formally accused of a crime. But in an unusual civil 
proceeding, Bouknight, on the advice of her attorneys, has refused a Baltimore 
juvenile court judge's order that she produce Maurice -- or arrange for him to 
be found -- so the state can retake custody. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen months ago, the judge ordered her locked up until she changed her mind. 
Bouknight's attorneys appealed to Maryland's highest court and won an order 
releasing her. The state then appealed to the Supreme Court, which ordered her 
kept in jail until it reviews the case this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Bouknight's situation bears some resemblance to the well-publicized case of 
Elizabeth Morgan, a physician jailed for civil contempt in Washington, D.C., 
since 1987 for hiding her 6-year-old daughter in defiance of a court order 
giving visitation rights to her former husband. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Bouknight's time in jail, one of her attorneys said, she "has always 
denied that any harm has come to the child." 
</P>
<P>
But because police suspect Maurice was harmed or even killed by his mother, 
Bouknight's attorneys argue, their client would be supplying evidence against 
herself if she admitted having control over the boy and it turned out he had 
been abused. Compelling her to produce her son violates her Fifth Amendment 
right against self-incrimination, attorneys contend. 
</P>
<P>
If the Supreme Court agrees with Bouknight, "then it means the risk to children 
in this country will be substantially increased," because other parents in such 
situations could hide their children and invoke the Fifth Amendment, said Ralph 
S. Tyler III, an assistant Maryland attorney general who is seeking to keep 
Bouknight in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler, echoing numerous child-welfare advocates, said the power to coerce 
uncooperative parents by jailing them is the most potent weapon available to 
juvenile court judges in trying to rescue battered youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, we're going to be in a real mess" if Bouknight prevails, said Judge 
W. Don Reader of Stark County, Ohio, president-elect of the National Council of 
Juvenile and Family Court Judges. "I think the court, as a practical matter, 
loses its power to protect a child -- and protecting children is what we're in 
business for." 
</P>
<P>
The state, in court petitions, argues that the Fifth Amendment does not protect 
Bouknight from the judge's order that she surrender Maurice -- just as it does 
not protect citizens from certain other "potentially incriminating, 
state-compelled actions," such as standing in police lineups or supplying 
court-ordered blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Fifth Amendment does apply in Bouknight's case, she still ought to 
be forced to produce Maurice, the state says. The "juvenile court's statutory 
duty to protect this abused and neglected child outweighs his mother's 
constitutional privilege against self-incrimination," the state says. 
</P>
<P>
Bouknight's attorneys said the state has succumbed to "hysteria" in its concern 
about the case's potential impact on juvenile courts. 
</P>
<P>
There are other ways besides civil contempt for authorities to put pressure on 
a parent in Bouknight's situation, said George Burns, one of four Baltimore 
public defenders representing her. For instance, he said, they could use 
criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Burns said, for example, that laws "in virtually every state" make it a crime 
for a parent willfully to cause a child to become "in need of assistance" from 
a social services agency. He said Maryland authorities could charge Bouknight 
with criminally creating such a situation for Maurice by having concealed him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rely on Criminal Statutes 
</P>
<P>
If the Supreme Court rules for Bouknight, he said, "it won't be devastating at 
all. It'll just require (states) to rely more on criminal statutes, and not go 
the easy way with civil contempt." 
</P>
<P>
Burns also disagreed that the state's duty to protect Maurice "outweighs" his 
mother's Fifth Amendment right -- a right that one of Bouknight's other 
attorneys called "part of the backbone of our due-process system." 
</P>
<P>
The Maryland Court of Appeals agreed with Bouknight's attorneys and ordered her 
freed Dec. 19, after eight months in jail. But U.S. Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist granted an immediate stay, keeping her locked up. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, where is Maurice? 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys on both sides say the Baltimore Department of Social Services' 
failure to keep track of him is partly to blame for his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
Cristina Gutierrez, another of Bouknight's attorneys, said Social Services' 
handling of the case left her "appalled as a parent and appalled as a citizen." 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1987, when Maurice was hospitalized for the second time, the social 
services agency was notified of the possibility of child abuse, according to 
court documents. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I know about my client, her limitations might render her guilty of 
child neglect and an inability to learn parenting skills, but not a battering," 
Gutierrez said of Bouknight, who was not criminally charged with child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Her IQ is borderline retarded," Gutierrez said. "She grew up in and out of 
foster care, and she was basically left hanging. I don't think she even 
finished the seventh grade. . . . She has no skills at all." 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez recently arranged for her client to be interviewed in jail for this 
story, but canceled the meeting, saying Bouknight was too distraught. 
</P>
<P>
When Maurice was born, Bouknight was living in her grandfather's well-kept row 
house on Baltimore's North Washington Street. The infant's father, Terrance 
Miles, a convicted small-time drug dealer, was shot to death in 1988 at age 22. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began Counseling Sessions 
</P>
<P>
After Maurice's second hospitalization, the social services agency obtained a 
juvenile court order placing him in foster care. Bouknight, meanwhile, followed 
the agency's advice and began counseling sessions with a clinical social 
worker, according to court petitions. 
</P>
<P>
A juvenile court judge scheduled a hearing for Aug. 18, 1987 -- seven months 
after Maurice had been placed in a foster home -- to decide whether he should 
be returned to his mother, under monitoring from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney involved in the case, who asked not to be identified, said the 
judge's decision was to hinge on a psychologist's evaluation of Bouknight. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with her, the psychologist wrote: "She is not now able to relate 
constructively to her child, since the child is seen as fulfilling her needs 
rather than the reverse. She becomes totally frustrated and enraged to find 
herself unable to gain from her child what . . . she lacked in her own 
childhood. When her frustration mounts, she is likely to act out toward the 
child." 
</P>
<P>
Court records indicate that because of a bureaucratic snarl, the psychologist's 
report was not available for the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protective Supervision 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, with no objection from Social Services, the judge put Maurice back 
in his mother's custody. Bouknight signed an "order of protective supervision" 
that required her to refrain from striking her son and to cooperate with social 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, on Sept. 4, 1987, a caseworker assigned to supervise 
Bouknight visited the row house on North Washington Street for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Maurice appeared well-fed with good affect and hygiene," according to the 
agency's chronology, which is included in court records. 
</P>
<P>
Four days after the first visit, a Social Services parenting aide stopped by 
the row house. "Saw mother and child," reads the entry for that day, Sept. 8, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
No one in authority has seen Maurice since. 
</P>
<P>
From Oct. 13, 1987, to April 7, 1988, social workers visited the row house nine 
times but never saw Maurice, according to the chronology. Bouknight often was 
not home. When she was home, she told them that her son was with an aunt but 
refused to disclose the aunt's name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Relatives 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on April 7, a caseworker told a supervisor about Maurice's absences. 
The chronology indicates a suddenly frantic effort to locate him starting that 
day. The caseworker called clinics where Maurice had been treated, asked 
colleagues if they had seen him, and called or visited "every known relative" 
of Bouknight's from Baltimore to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a plan, when this child was returned to his mother, that he'd be 
watched over and protected, and these things weren't done," said Susan Leviton, 
a University of Maryland law professor and director of Advocates for Children 
and Youth, a nonprofit group. "What was going on all those months? What were 
these (social workers) thinking? What were they doing?" 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore agency has been criticized often in the past after children under 
its supervision were abused by their parents or in foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
J.C. Shay, a spokesman for Maryland's Department of Human Resources, said the 
department's social services agencies across the state are monitoring about 
6,000 children who live with their parents under orders of "protective 
supervision," as Maurice was. Citing confidentiality laws, he declined to 
discuss the Bouknight case. 
</P>
<P>
On April 12, 1988 -- seven months and four days after Maurice had last been 
seen by anyone from Social Services -- the caseworker reported him missing to 
Officer Charles Klein of the Baltimore police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Why Did You Wait?' 
</P>
<P>
Klein recalled recently that when the caseworker told him he had not seen 
Maurice for seven months, "I came about four feet up off the floor. I looked at 
him and I said, 'Man, are you for real?' And he said, 'What do you mean?' And I 
said to him, you know, 'My God, why did you wait so long?' " 
</P>
<P>
Klein said he "never got a straight answer." 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, after Bouknight failed to produce Maurice, a juvenile court 
judge sent her to the Baltimore City Jail, and there she remains. 
</P>
<P>
How long she will stay locked up is unclear. Civil contempt orders are intended 
to be coercive, not punitive. At some point, if Bouknight's attorneys can 
persuade a judge that the coercion has failed and that their client will never 
give in, she could be released. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, she waits for the Supreme Court.

BODY PARTS NEEDED FOR TRANSPLANTS; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE IN HUMAN ORGANS STIRS GLOBAL ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Turkish peasant claims one of his kidneys was stolen. Philippine prison 
inmates trade organs for reduced sentences. Brokers in human body parts take 
their cut of a shadowy market. 
</P>
<P>
The forces of supply and demand in the desperate world of organ transplants 
have created a commercial trade in human organs that worries health officials 
and ethicists worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The need for organs to replace faltering body parts is growing as research 
advances and surgery is more successful. But the number of donated organs has 
failed to keep pace. Doctors say too few people die in circumstances that 
provide transplantable organs. When they do, relatives are often too grieved to 
donate a loved one's organ or object for religious or cultural reasons. 
</P>
<P>
What to do about the organ trade varies. The United States, Japan and West 
Germany have banned it. In India, such trade thrives legally. Lawmakers in 
Britain and the Philippines have just begun grappling with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"There simply doesn't seem to be any country that has a public policy to 
generate enough organs to meet the demand," said Arthur Caplan, director of the 
Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization in May called for a global ban on commercial 
trafficking in human organs. Dr. Ursula Lehr, the West German health minister, 
spoke for the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of business-minded brokers taking advantage of the financial distress 
of people in the Third World, buying their organs for a pittance and reselling 
them to wealthy patients in developed countries, is awful for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But some ask, what's wrong if people, fully informed of the risks, decide to 
sell one of their organs, for example, a kidney? The question, however, becomes 
complicated when the potential donor is desperately poor. People can live with 
one kidney, and offers for transplantable kidneys have ranged in individual 
instances from $3,000 to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it really for us, who are not faced with those difficulties and that 
heart-rending decision, to deny people that choice?" Neil Hamilton, a British 
lawmaker, asked in recent parliamentary debate. 
</P>
<P>
"It really isn't a choice if you're coerced by poverty," said Caplan, the 
Minnesota ethicist. 
</P>
<P>
Others worry that selling organs would decrease the supply of donated organs 
and make transplants more expensive in general. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe . . . organs would go to the highest bidder rather than to the 
patient who needs them most," said Bernadette Haze, a spokeswoman for the 
Netherlands-based Eurotransplant, which matches organ donors and recipients in 
the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, West Germany and Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Britain, which has no law controlling the sale of organs, took up the issue 
this year after a Turk was arrested in Istanbul for arranging commercial 
transplants at a private London hospital. One of the "donors" contended that he 
was duped and robbed of his kidney. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged organ broker, Tunc Ay Kunter, was convicted May 18 and sentenced to 
two years in prison for brokering the sale of a Turkish peasant's kidney to a 
Libyan doctor. Police said Kunter confessed to arranging four such sales when 
he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Turkish law allows organ donation but outlaws selling, brokering or buying 
human organs. 
</P>
<P>
The peasant, Ahmet Koc, who got a two-year suspended sentence, contended that 
he went to the hospital for a physical connected to a job offer and thought he 
was being anesthetized for the checkup. After the kidney was removed, he said 
he was paid the equivalent of $4,267. 
</P>
<P>
British lawmakers have introduced legislation making it a crime to pay or 
receive payment for a human organ. Parliament is expected to pass it. 
</P>
<P>
Organ sales are not illegal in the Philippines, but in late May, the vice 
president of the Philippine Senate filed a bill to ban sale of human organs and 
tissues, calling practitioners "modern-day Draculas." 
</P>
<P>
Filipino Death Row prisoners began donating organs in 1976 as part of a program 
to reduce overcrowding without resorting to widespread executions, explained 
Pablo Rosales, assistant director of the National Penitentiary. Rosales said 
most donor inmates avoided execution and some were freed after spending a few 
more years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
When capital punishment was banned in 1987, prisoners started asking for money, 
he said. One prisoner who donated a kidney even complained to Rosales that he 
received only $95, without the cassette recorder he was promised. 
</P>
<P>
Media attention greatly reduced the number of people seeking prisoners' organs, 
Rosales said, and no prisoner has donated a kidney since last year. 
</P>
<P>
But Rosales believes organ sales continue with private donors, most likely poor 
slum dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kazuo Ota, chairman of the Japan Society for Transplantation, said he knew 
of several patients who had organ transplants in the Philippines and that some 
Japanese were acting as organ brokers. Organ sales are banned in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jorge Neumann of the Sao Paulo Heart Institute and a member of the 
Brazilian Assn. of Organ Transplants said that "certainly there exists a black 
market of organs in Brazil." But he said no statistics on organ sales were 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, reports in foreign newspapers that adoption rings were routinely 
buying babies in Third World countries and selling them to American and Israeli 
families whose children needed organ transplants prompted outrage from American 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department in October blamed the Soviet Union for the reports and 
said a European Parliament resolution criticizing the purported activity was 
based on "false and misleading statements and a discredited report by a Soviet 
front organization." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, selling organs has been illegal since 1984, and sentiment 
against the practice is high. But allegations of influence-peddling in 
arranging precious transplants surface from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Justice Department investigators said they had dropped an 
investigation into accusations that pioneering surgeon Thomas Starzl, head of 
transplants at Presbyterian-University and Children's hospitals in Pittsburgh, 
had given high-paying foreigners preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation followed newspaper articles that said about 28% of 
transplants performed by Starzl's team in 1984-85 were on foreigners who often 
weren't as sick as other patients or had waited a shorter time, but who had 
paid surgeon's fees four times higher than Americans who had the same 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Caplan argues for regulations to ensure that medical need, rather than money or 
influence, determines who gets available organs. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the field say the risk of exploitation would be reduced if a neutral 
party, such as government, replaced organ brokers. And donations might increase 
with incentives such as compensation to donors or their families for all 
medical costs, time lost from work or burial expenses. There could also be a 
break on inheritance or other taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, transplant researchers began looking at animal-to-human transplants. 
</P>
<P>
At a May meeting of the American Society of Transplant Physicians, researchers 
predicted that pigs would become the main source of donor organs once 
cross-species transplantation becomes practical. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always been a shortage of organs and there probably always will be 
unless we learn to take them out of animals," said Caplan. "I don't know if 
it's going to be biologically feasible, but I think that's the direction we 
have to try."

KIDNEY SALES BROKERAGE IS FLOURISHING IN INDIA 
</P>

BOMBAY, India 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abdul Hai, a stocky 34-year-old now in police detention, sells human kidneys 
for a living. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't jailed for dealing in kidneys; the sale of body organs is legal in 
India. Hai was arrested when a kidney donor complained of being mugged after 
refusing to pay Hai a commission. 
</P>
<P>
Hai says he is one of about 100 middlemen who procure kidneys for the ailing 
rich from Bombay's willing poor. 
</P>
<P>
Hai, who worked as a doctor's chauffeur before becoming a kidney broker, said 
he has arranged the sale of 20 kidneys since a surgeon suggested the business 
to him a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"People queue up, ready to give away a kidney. You can find such donors 
everywhere," he said in a cellblock interview. 
</P>
<P>
Hai was arrested May 12 after Dhanraj Agarwal, a street vendor, told police 
that two people attacked him and stole almost $2,000 he had been paid for a 
kidney. Agarwal said the attack came minutes after he refused to give Hai a 
commission, according to Police Inspector Appa Sahib Shinde. 
</P>
<P>
"We have detained him only on suspicion of robbery, and it doesn't matter to me 
if he sells 
</P>
<P>
kidneys for a living or not," Shinde said. Hai has denied involvement in the 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Hai told a reporter that he charged roughly $95 to $190 for matching donors and 
patients. India requires a kidney donor to officially affirm his desire to 
voluntarily give up a kidney, but before that moment the donor could already 
have collected $1,875 to $3,125 from the recipient, Hai said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doctors Divided 
</P>
<P>
The flourishing kidney trade has sharply divided Indian doctors along ethical 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
"The world knows that Bombay is a center for buying kidneys. I think it is a 
shame for us to be so notoriously known," said Kisan Mehta, head of the Life 
Foundation, a private group that advocates kidney transplants from cadavers. 
Indian laws prohibit transplants from the dead. 
</P>
<P>
"But what is ethics to a man who is dying?" asked Dr. Keshava Chandra Reddy, a 
kidney transplant specialist in Madras. The urologist said he and other 
surgeons from the Pandalai Cardiothoracic Foundation have transplanted 485 
kidneys in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Renal transplants became common in India about seven years ago when the 
anti-rejection drug cyclosporine became available locally. There are no 
official figures on the number of transplants performed in India. But since 
cyclosporine's introduction, at least $7.8 million has changed hands in 
connection with the estimated 4,000 kidney transplants performed in Bombay, 
according to Dr. B. N. Colabawalla, chief of the National Kidney Foundation.

A suspected car thief who sat in jail for 2 1/2 months, steadfastly refusing to

</P>
<P>
Authorities learned that their John Doe prisoner is really Brent Slattengren, 
27, after Slattengren's father, a judge in Minnesota, saw a picture of his son 
next to a story about a mysterious inmate in Oregon who would not reveal his 
identity.

LATIN AMERICA LACKS FUNDS TO PRESERVE BOOKS;

STORY OF LIBRARIES A SAD CHAPTER IN FISCAL CRISIS

BOGOTA, Colombia

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In her small laboratory, Maritza Vela Garzon gently opened a 400-year-old book 
as if it were a jewel case. 
</P>
<P>
The red-and-black Gothic type revealed a breathtaking antiquity -- and a tragic 
carelessness: There are thumb-sized holes in the first few pages. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone put Scotch tape on these pages," she said. "They thought they were 
doing the right thing, keeping a tear from worsening." 
</P>
<P>
The glue from the tape eventually ate through the old paper. 
</P>
<P>
Vela Garzon, the Colombian National Library's only staff expert in book 
preservation and restoration, hopes to repair the damage. It's a painstaking, 
frustrating task. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15th-Century Volume 
</P>
<P>
Among the library's 28,000 old and rare books are entire Jesuit libraries 
seized in the late 1700s by the Spaniards. The oldest volume was produced in 
1480. Many were written or illustrated by hand. 
</P>
<P>
They beg for attention. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of negligence," the library's director, Ruben Sierra, 
explained in an interview. "It's simply a lack of money." 
</P>
<P>
The same refrain can be heard across financially strapped Latin America, where 
governments struggling with big foreign debts, grinding poverty and other 
urgent economic and social problems have little time or money for cultural 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra said he has heard stories from state librarians of much worse situations 
in other countries. One national library's shelves are full of cats, he said, 
because it's the only affordable way they can deal with the rats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Austerity Program 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, compared to most neighboring countries, Colombia enjoys a thriving 
economy and a low inflation rate, running at about 25% a year. But its 
$20-billion debt is still burdensome, and a program of relative public 
austerity has been in effect for years. 
</P>
<P>
"They promised us some money, but it didn't come," Sierra said. "There's always 
something else that takes precedence. Last year, it was emergency flood aid for 
the coast. This year, who knows what it will be." 
</P>
<P>
Sierra said he expects to receive about 30 million pesos, the equivalent of 
about $80,000, to run the 900,000-volume library this year. It is less than 
half of what the library requested. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he is hopeful the government will come up with an extra 200 
million pesos (about $540,000) next year for creating a respectable 
conservation and restoration center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Laboratory 
</P>
<P>
Vela Garzon works alone in her small lab, crowded with equipment, much of it 
donated by the Organization of American States. She has one small chest for 
fumigating the several hundred old books infected with mold, a few dozen at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first step. There is much left to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"For right now, we can only take care of the most valuable or those that most 
urgently need attention." 
</P>
<P>
The library was created in the 1770s, when Colombia was still a colony of 
Spain. Authorities needed a place to shelter thousands of leather-bound volumes 
confiscated from Jesuit colleges and missions when the Roman Catholic clerical 
order was expelled from the Spanish kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
All the rare volumes have been catalogued; not so for the rest of the library. 
Boxes holding 40,000 books are piled high in the cellar. No one is sure when 
they arrived or exactly what they hold. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sierra, a predecessor solved a similar problem in 1972 by simply 
selling 15,000 books as scrap to a local paper company. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a barbarous act," he said. But he added that some of the books were 
salvaged, including historically important records.

PERCEPTION OF AIDES' CORRUPTION ERODES AQUINO'S POPULARITY

<TEXT>
<P>
As chief of the anti-smuggling agency in the Philippines, Jose Almonte calls 
himself an "economic warrior." 
</P>
<P>
His greatest challenge, however, is knowing if the enemy includes his own 
superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Almonte, like many who supported Corazon Aquino's rise to power in 1986, is 
waging a war against corruption in which battle lines are blurred. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for instance, he charged two Aquino-allied congressmen with 
smuggling, only to see Congress retaliate by slashing his agency's budget to 5 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popularity Eroded 
</P>
<P>
Charges of official corruption are striking deeper and deeper into the 
once-mighty moral shield of President Aquino's government. Although she is seen 
as untainted, the perception of graft by her underlings -- and her weak action 
against it -- has eroded her popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Almonte, a former army officer, fights smuggling with the same moral zeal that 
he once fought Communist guerrillas. In 1986 as a colonel, he helped plan a 
coup attempt against Ferdinand Marcos. When Aquino took power, she made him the 
first officer promoted to the rank of general and later appointed him to the 
bureau that battles smuggling, a popular crime in this nation of more than 
7,000 islands. 
</P>
<P>
"Corruption under Marcos was a wholesale theft of dollars from foreign loans," 
he said. "Now we see Filipinos stealing from each other." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent land-reform scandal, for instance, a group of people tried to cheat 
the government out of $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the size of Imelda Marcos's kitty for flowers," Almonte said. Even 
within his own department, known as the Economic Intelligence and Investigation 
Bureau, Almonte has a tough fight. The temptation to take bribes or make off 
with a confiscated container of imported goods is great among the bureau's 
low-paid workers. He has already fired 300 out of 1,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
But, he admitted, until Aquino comes out more strongly in both action and words 
against corruption, his crusade is constrained. For the first couple of years 
of her six-year term, she pursued a policy of reconciliation among Filipinos 
rather than exercising tough leadership against wrongdoers. 
</P>
<P>
Most observers say it is unclear whether there is any more or less corruption 
under Aquino than there was during Marcos. What is certain is that corruption 
is more easily exposed even as Filipinos expect more from Aquino, whose 
anti-graft campaign against Marcos helped to bring him down. Aquino has slowly 
tried to reform the court system, but the effort remains limited because she 
does not want to appear to be hand-picking judges and thus gaining favors. 
</P>
<P>
Three recent incidents, though, have forced Aquino to get tougher against 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
One was the land-reform scandal, known as the Garchitornena affair, that many 
observers say has set back a key Aquino program by six months. The president 
formed a special investigative body to clean up the affair in June and 
appointed a new chief of the land-reform agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Army Major Killed 
</P>
<P>
Another was the killing of an army major during a holdup that revealed deep 
military and police involvement in financial crimes, sparking an Aquino-ordered 
crackdown in military ranks. 
</P>
<P>
The third was political sniping by Aquino's nemesis, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, 
over her family's plan to "reform" their 14,000-acre sugar estate. The plan, 
using a legal loophole in the 1987 land-reform law, would leave two-thirds of 
the estate's ownership in family hands, while giving one-third of the 
corporation's shares to the 6,000 workers over the next three decades. Enrile's 
criticism of the plan angered Aquino. She launched a counterattack by bringing 
up Enrile's past deeds when he served as defense minister under Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
But more than just sparking a Filipino political feud, the dispute caused 
Aquino to make some careful admissions. She shelved the family land-reform plan 
for the time being and announced in a speech June 19 that "corruption has 
returned, if not on the same scale (as under Marcos), certainly with equal 
shamelessness." 
</P>
<P>
She promised renewed anti-corruption efforts that would "spare no one." She 
threw her support behind a new private group called the National Coalition for 
Transparency (meaning clean government). 
</P>
<P>
She tried to explain why no one from the Marcos era has been jailed for 
corruption, saying she feared being accused of waging a "political vendetta." 
The military came in for an attack too. She ordered Defense Secretary Fidel 
Ramos to remove "scalawags and misfits" from the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Order of Battle' 
</P>
<P>
Ramos quickly told commanders to draw up an "order of battle" against the 
corrupt in uniform, while claiming that the military justice system had already 
investigated or punished 1,195 service personnel. 
</P>
<P>
How far such talk will go is unknown. The battles over corruption are often 
seen by observers here as just shadow-play for the 1992 presidential race or as 
a reflection of public disappointment after the high hopes of Aquino's 
overthrow of Marcos.

UNION CIVIL WAR PRISON CAMP AN ALL-BUT-FORGOTTEN RELIC OF BRUTALITY

ELMIRA, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like some rusty bayonet or tattered battle flag hidden away in the attic, the 
Elmira prison camp is an all-but-forgotten relic of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the human suffering involved, maybe memories of the prison, which 
opened 125 years ago this month, are best left undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a flagpole, a small monument and two stone markers, there's nothing 
in the quiet Elmira neighborhood where the prison camp once stood to mark its 
presence. But buried beneath tidy rows of white headstones and shade trees at 
the Woodlawn National Cemetery are the remains of 2,973 Confederate soldiers 
who died at Elmira, many from starvation. 
</P>
<P>
The Confederacy's Andersonville prison in Georgia is remembered as the most 
infamous example of the inhumanity and deprivations of the Civil War, even 
though records show that a soldier imprisoned in Elmira stood little better 
chance of surviving than did one in Andersonville. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Death Camp?' 
</P>
<P>
Questions linger over whether those 2,973 Rebels died mainly because of the 
primitive state of medicine and sanitation during the Civil War, or whether 
they were victims of the Lincoln Administration's retaliatory neglect of some 
prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
"Can one say that, by design, this was a death camp?" asked J. Michael Horigan, 
an Elmira history teacher who spent much of the past year researching records 
from Civil War prison camps in Washington, D.C., and in the South. "I think one 
can say it, but you can't document it. The records on this camp are very 
incomplete. But circumstantial evidence certainly makes it look that way." 
</P>
<P>
Union officials ordered in May, 1864, that a complex of barracks at Elmira that 
had been used for three years to house Union soldiers be converted to a prison 
camp for captive Southerners. A 12-foot-high fence was immediately thrown 
around a 30-acre portion of barracks. 
</P>
<P>
There were 35 wooden buildings in the complex, each about 100 feet long and 16 
feet wide. Union officers in Elmira wrote the War Department that the barracks 
could accommodate 3,000 men comfortably and 1,000 more in a pinch. 
</P>
<P>
Orders came back from Washington that 10,000 men were to be housed in the camp. 
Men not lucky enough to get places in barracks would sleep in tents. Wooden 
barracks weren't constructed for all the men until well after winter had set 
in. 
</P>
<P>
On July 6, 1864, a train pulled into Elmira with the first 399-man contingent 
of prisoners on board. 
</P>
<P>
It was a ragged group of prisoners. Most had been captured during the grinding 
battles of the Wilderness in Virginia. Elmirans noted that their ragtag 
uniforms hardly made the men look like members of the same army. Some prisoners 
wore only shirts and underwear. Many had no shoes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grisly Beginning 
</P>
<P>
Things went wrong at the prison camp almost from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
On July 15, a train loaded with 844 Confederates and 128 Union guards bound for 
Elmira smashed head-on with a coal train near Shohola, Pa. Many of the wooden 
cars were reduced to kindling in the accident, which killed 49 prisoners and 17 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
Five prisoners escaped during the chaos, and it took three days for some of the 
wounded to receive medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fouled Pond 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inside the camp, a peril just as lethal, although slower in its 
effect, was taking shape. 
</P>
<P>
A stagnant body of water, called Foster's Pond, was within the fences of the 
prison. With so many men being sent to the camp -- there would be more than 
4,400 by the end of July, and 9,600 by the end of August -- the water quickly 
became fouled. The pond became a breeding ground of disease amid an extended 
heat wave that summer. 
</P>
<P>
Less than three weeks after Elmira opened, a local newspaper reported that a 
"deleterious miasma" hung over the camp due to the stagnant water. One Union 
surgeon called it a "festering mass of corruption." 
</P>
<P>
Prison administrators asked the Union's commissioner general of prisoners, Col. 
William Hoffman, for permission to dig canals connecting the pond with the 
nearby Chemung River to allow fresher water to pass through it. 
</P>
<P>
Approval for that project didn't come until October -- and prisoners didn't 
complete the canals until Jan. 1, 1865. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this falls into the realm of circumstantial evidence," Horigan says. 
"This is what I call the politics of delay. The sluice could have been done by 
August, 1864." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disease Spread 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, men were dying in droves. 
</P>
<P>
"The scurvy was among us, and as the cold weather advanced the death rate 
increased rapidly," wrote prisoner L.B. Jones. "Scurvy, typhoid, pneumonia and 
finally smallpox broke out to an alarming extent, carrying off great numbers of 
the poor fellows." 
</P>
<P>
Emory Thomas, a history professor at the University of Georgia, says doctors at 
Elmira weren't different from those practicing elsewhere during a war in which 
twice as many men died from disease than from battle-related wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors really weren't convinced about the germ theory of disease at this 
point," he said. "At this time they were dealing with very, very nuts-and-bolts 
things, like how to set a fracture properly and whether chloroform would kill 
and if ether was better than chloroform. These are important things, but we're 
not talking about great leaps forward in medical practice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rations Small 
</P>
<P>
The food at Elmira could have been another problem. Elmira prisoners after the 
war said a day's rations generally included two, 1-inch-thick slices of bread, 
2 ounces of meat and a pint of soup, often only the thin broth in which the 
meat was cooked. Union officers insisted after the war that rations at Elmira 
were more generous. 
</P>
<P>
"I was assured by a guard that the same rations were issued to the prisoners as 
to the U.S. troops stationed there," Confederate soldier Erastus Palmer 
recalled after the war. "There seemed to me to be some bad leak in it before it 
got to us." 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1864, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton had ordered that prison rations to 
Confederates being held in Northern camps be reduced to the same level as those 
Southern troops in the field were receiving. This coincided with the Lincoln 
Administration's general hardening of its treatment of Southern prisoners 
starting that year as news began to filter north of the deprivations being 
endured by Union soldiers at Andersonville, the Libby prison in Richmond, Va., 
and other Confederate camps. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Vindictive Man' 
</P>
<P>
Horigan calls Stanton a "very vindictive man" who exercised virtual dictatorial 
control over the Northern prison camp system. 
</P>
<P>
"Abraham Lincoln had very little to do with any decision-making as far as the 
prison-camp system was concerned," Horigan said. "One of the characteristics of 
his presidency was that he (delegated) power to his Cabinet members. He gave 
them an enormous amount of power and an enormous amount of leeway." 
</P>
<P>
Many of Elmira's prisoners blamed Stanton too. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my honest opinion that Secretary Stanton did this in retaliation," 
Virginia soldier Enos Lyons later wrote of conditions at Elmira. "Yes, men died 
in Elmira prison I know from hunger and want; this in a land of plenty. I was 
young and strong and determined I would not be carried out if I could help it, 
but many poor prisoners lay right down and died of hunger." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More than 20% Died 
</P>
<P>
According to figures compiled by an early-century historian of the Elmira 
prison, Clay Holmes, 27% of the camp's captives died. Pulitzer Prize-winning 
Civil War historian James McPherson places Elmira's mortality rate at 24%. 
</P>
<P>
By way of comparison, 13,000, or 29%, of the 45,000 Union soldiers imprisoned 
at Andersonville died. 
</P>
<P>
For the Civil War as a whole, 15.5% of the Union soldiers imprisoned in 28 
Southern camps died while in captivity and 12% of the Confederates in 24 
Northern camps died. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, have Elmira and other Northern prisons with high death rates -- Camp 
Alton, Ill.; Lookout Point, Md.; Johnson's Island, Ohio; and Rock Island, Ill. 
-- escaped Andersonville's notoriety? 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that Elmira and others lack infamy, I would guess it has to do 
with who won the war," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mismanagement on Both Sides 
</P>
<P>
Andersonville's commandant, Henry Wirz, was the only soldier executed after the 
Civil War as a war criminal, an act that caused lingering resentment for 
decades among some Southerners who claimed that he was made a scapegoat for the 
mismanagement of prison camps on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
And the only historic site operated by the National Park Service at a former 
Civil War prison camp is at Andersonville. Events including historic 
re-creations, memorial services and even an archeological dig will be held 
throughout this year to mark Andersonville's 125th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
But Elmira's anniversary will pass quietly. The chances are good that most of 
the people living in the well-maintained, turn-of-the-century homes around the 
former site of the camp won't give the historic significance of this year a 
second thought. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in the South know Elmira," Horigan said. "They know their 
granddaddy was there or whatever. And quite a few compare it to Andersonville. 
I don't think they're correct in doing so. Nothing else was Andersonville. 
</P>
<P>
"But why we only think of Andersonville when we think of Civil War prison camps 
I don't know. These places were bad places, all of them were. It was 
despicable, the way both the South and the Union treated their prisoners. It 
was the darkest chapter of the war." 
</P>
<P>
A Union surgeon called the camp a 'festering mass of corruption.'

LAW PUTS TEACHERS AT HEAD OF THE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Minnesota teachers will soon get more of a say over who gets to teach with a 
new law that will put them at the head of the class nationally in terms of 
self-regulation. 
</P>
<P>
A state law effective Aug. 1 gives teachers a majority of seats on the Board of 
Teaching, which operates independently of the Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The board grants licenses, sets standards, approves college programs for 
teachers and monitors professional conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just rearranging the chairs on the Titanic," said Bella Rosenberg, 
assistant to President Albert Shanker of the American Federation of Teachers in 
Washington. "This has gone further than any other legislation we've seen." 
</P>
<P>
She and other advocates of education reform say they hope the law will lead to 
better preparation of new teachers and greater accountability for the 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number of Board Members Cut 
</P>
<P>
A bill signed May 25 by Gov. Rudy Perpich reduces the board created in 1973 
from 15 to 11 members by attrition over the next few years while keeping the 
six members who are teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the board will be made up of a higher education faculty member, a 
school administrator, two current or former school board members and one person 
with no connection to education. 
</P>
<P>
The governor appoints all board members. Bills that failed recently in other 
states gave teacher unions the right to appoint board members. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll be a lighthouse of a new generation," said Ann McLaren, program manager 
of the National Education Assn.'s instruction and professional development 
division. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teachers Gain Control 
</P>
<P>
The 20,000-member Minnesota Federation of Teachers and some Board of Teaching 
members wonder why it took so long to give teachers the kind of control over 
their field that other professions enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been our argument, that all other professional boards -- hairdressers 
and barbers -- have a majority," said Jean Carlstrom, vice chairman of the 
Board of Teaching and a special-education teacher. "Because everyone's been to 
school they think they're an authority on education." 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota School Boards Assn. opposed the original bill but supported the 
final version because of an amendment giving the Legislature final say over the 
creation of any new licensing categories. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought the public would be well served to keep control of that ability to 
remove licenses and grant licenses for teachers," said Bob Meeks, the 
association's associate director for legislative services. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike doctors and lawyers who regulate their professions, teachers have a 
"captive audience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Preparation 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Teaching already is working on rules to require colleges to better 
prepare teachers to recognize which students need special attention, Carlstrom 
said. It also is considering increasing the student-teaching requirement to one 
year from one quarter, she said.

CHICAGO VOLUNTEERS PATROL CITY PARKS

<P>
Garfield Park is surrounded by some of the city's meanest streets, and sending 
four unofficial rangers to patrol the gang-infested area on expensive bicycles 
is what some are calling a tragedy waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"There's less crime in the park than in the neighborhoods around it -- that's 
the good news," said police Sgt. John Rooney, a member of the violent crimes 
unit. "The bad news is that I wouldn't advise anybody -- ranger or not -- to 
ride through Garfield Park on a $700 bicycle. The idea doesn't exactly strike 
me as a brainstorm." 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers in the Parks program, as conceived by city parks officials, was to 
be a network of hundreds of volunteers and off-duty police officers on 
horseback and all-terrain vehicles crisscrossing the city's parks -- good-will 
ambassadors backed by police powers and a $90,000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduced Pilot Program 
</P>
<P>
What it became after budget cuts was a $12,000 pilot program in Garfield Park. 
</P>
<P>
"We first envisioned this with rangers in 12 parks, guides for tourists in the 
lakefront parks . . . promoting our programs and teaching appreciation for the 
history and beauty of the parks -- at one point, even an 
eyes-and-ears-of-the-police kind of thing," said Jim Albritton, the Park 
District supervisor in charge of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The first element cut from the Rangers program was any kind of law-enforcement 
role. 
</P>
<P>
Though they carry two-way radios and are in touch with Park District 
supervisors -- who in turn can call police -- the rangers will have "very 
limited roles as peacekeepers," Albritton said. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is build good-will in the park, not break up fights. To make friends 
with the kids, report equipment that needs fixing, nudge people to clean up 
after themselves, keep an eye peeled for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
"But whether they should call in if they see a drug buy, for instance, that's a 
very touchy question," Albritton said. "We're still working on those 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Answers Needed 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said Park District officials had better come up with the answers 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a few gangs and lots of dope being sold in some parts of the park," 
he said. "There's potential for trouble if they get mixed up in that." 
</P>
<P>
Freda Collins, a former speech pathologist and construction worker who is the 
lone woman on the crew, said she believes her job is to be visible, "to 
encourage people to bring their kids and their picnic baskets back to the 
park." 
</P>
<P>
Each ranger receives an 18-speed trail bike, a uniform and three days of 
training. They work eight hours each day from June until early September, 
earning $6 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Collins' colleagues are fourth-grade teacher Isaac Battle, former military 
policeman Donnell Daniel and former marketing executive Randis Clark. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not so much worried about the danger; we all live in the area and know 
what goes down," she said. "That's what the police are for."

NESUHI ERTEGUN, 71; PRODUCER, RECORD INDUSTRY LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nesuhi Ertegun, who rose from a teen-age jazz fanatic to become a powerful 
record executive, died Saturday in New York after cancer surgery. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
Ertegun, who was born in Istanbul, created WEA International company, the 
distributor outside the United States of the music products of Warner Brothers 
Records, Atlantic Records, Elektra Records and MCA Records. He founded the firm 
in 1971 and remained its president and chief executive officer until 1987. He 
was also a writer, historian and producer of recordings by a wide range of 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Son of Ambassador 
</P>
<P>
Ertegun's fascination with jazz began when his father, then Turkish ambassador 
to Britain, took him to see a Duke Ellington concert at the London Palladium in 
1933. When his father became the Turkish ambassador to the United States, 
Ertegun and his brother, Ahmet, followed. The brothers began promoting jazz 
concerts in Washington in the early 1940s and had amassed a collection of 
20,000 records by the mid-1940s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1944, Ertegun and his first wife, Marili Morden, moved to Los Angeles where 
he opened a record shop. When the late actor Orson Welles suggested that 
Ertegun organize a band, he put together the New Orleans immortals Kid Ory, 
Mutt Carey and Jimmy Noone and founded the Crescent label to record them. 
Several years later, for the Contemporary label, he recorded such West Coast 
modern jazz artists as Shelly Manne, Shorty Rogers and Jimmy Guiffre. 
</P>
<P>
Ertegun lectured in the history of American music at UCLA, considered the first 
courses on the history of jazz given for college credit in an American 
university. 
</P>
<P>
In 1955, he moved to New York to help manage Ahmet's Atlantic Records, which 
the brothers started in 1948. He signed such artists as the Modern Jazz 
Quartet, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Charlie Mingus. He 
also signed pop singer Roberta Flack and produced recordings by Ray Charles, 
Bobby Darin, the Drifters and Big Joe Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Some performers criticized the Erteguns' motives. Mel Torme, for one, said: "I 
was ecstatic about singing with them . . . (but) the Erteguns basically are 
businessmen with a totally commercial approach." 
</P>
<P>
Ertegun was the first president of the National Assn. of Recording Arts and 
Sciences, which gives the record industry's Grammy awards. 
</P>
<P>
A soccer fan, he founded the New York Cosmos Soccer Club, now defunct, which 
brought international stars such as Pele to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Ertegun was also known for his flamboyance. Married four times, he spoke six 
languages and after his retirement, divided his time among his residences in 
New York City, Katonah, N.Y., and Binot, France. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Selma, his daughter, Leyla, and his son, Rustem.

WILLIAM B. CRITCHFIELD, 65; EXPERT PIONEERED STUDIES ON FOREST GENETICS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
William B. Critchfield, a pioneer and leading expert on forest genetics, died 
of a heart attack Tuesday in San Francisco. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
Before his retirement last year from the U.S. Forest Service, Critchfield's 
work in identifying and establishing relationships among tree species was 
considered a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the first to try to understand the role of genetic factors in 
the evolution of pine trees," said Connie Miller, who took over Critchfield's 
post at the Forest Service's Berkeley station. "Before that, work had been done 
on plants and animals, but not trees." 
</P>
<P>
His 1966 book, "Geographic Distribution of Pines of the World," continues to be 
considered the definitive text on the subject. He was internationally known for 
his work on pine tree evolution and frequently did consulting work in other 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
He also worked closely with the University of California's Forestry Department, 
helping graduate students with their careers. Miller said that future work on 
the so-called greenhouse effect will build on Critchfield's findings. 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota-born Critchfield grew up in North Dakota, and the story of his 
family's struggle during the Great Depression was recounted by his brother, 
Richard Critchfield, in the book, "Those Days," published in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Critchfield attended North Dakota Agricultural College before serving in the 
U.S. Navy during World War II. He received his doctorate from the University of 
California, and was on the Harvard research faculty before joining the Forest 
Service and returning to Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include two brothers and a sister. Services will be held Monday in 
Berkeley.

LONDON KIDNEYS-FOR-CASH SCANDAL PROMPTS ACTION TO BAN SALE OF ORGANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A government effort to ban trade in body parts was prompted by a 
kidneys-for-cash scandal at a private London hospital this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept of organs being bought and sold for money is entirely unacceptable 
in a civilized society," Health Minister Roger Freeman told a House of Commons 
committee during debate on proposed legislation outlawing organ sales. The bill 
is expected to pass Parliament later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Not all lawmakers agree. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill will cause death where there could be life, and to prolong suffering 
where we could provide relief," said Sir Michael McNair-Wilson, a Conservative 
Parliament member awaiting a kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reimbursed for Costs 
</P>
<P>
The legislation will make it a crime to pay or receive payment for a human 
organ, act as a broker in such transactions, or solicit buyers or sellers. It 
will, however, permit voluntary donors to be reimbursed for the costs of 
removing a kidney. 
</P>
<P>
British lawmakers acted after news reports in January that Turkish peasants 
were paid to donate kidneys for transplant surgery at the private Humana 
Wellington Hospital. Turkish authorities said donors were paid $3,200 to 
$5,600. 
</P>
<P>
After the disclosures, Humana Hospital barred two doctors and the General 
Medical Council, the disciplinary body for British physicians, opened an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said a Gallup Poll commissioned in February by the British Kidney 
Patients Assn. found that 87% of the respondents opposed commercial 
transactions in human organs. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether they would think the same if faced with the choice of paying for an 
organ or of one not being available, thereby causing death or prolonged 
suffering for a member of the family or a close friend, is another matter," 
McNair-Wilson said in committee debate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'List Is Growing' 
</P>
<P>
"We are discussing a shortage of organs for transplant, particularly of 
kidneys. The waiting list stands at 3,500 people, but the list is growing," he 
said. "Many people are suffering considerable discomfort for long periods. Many 
people, who could survive if they had a new kidney, die without cause." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman conceded that donations, which average 1,500 a year, were falling short 
of demand and noted that health authorities had been ordered to find ways to 
identify potential donors. The government has also asked health workers to 
record every death in intensive care and analyze why usable organs were not 
transplanted. 
</P>
<P>
After publicity about his plight, McNair-Wilson said a woman in Australia wrote 
to offer a kidney for $20,000. According to McNair-Wilson, the woman said she 
had lost her home in a fire, had no insurance and was sick of "pulling myself 
and my children up by the bootstraps." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dilemma Posed 
</P>
<P>
Neil Hamilton, who cast the only vote against the bill in committee, said he 
had pondered the dilemma facing one Turk who allegedly sold a kidney. 
</P>
<P>
"His daughter was suffering from a medical problem which threatened her life, 
but it could not be solved in Turkey without money," Hamilton said. "If he did 
not get the money for the operation, his daughter would die." 
</P>
<P>
A similar argument for the right to sell organs was advanced by Royden 
Harrison, emeritus professor of social history at Warwick University, in a 
February letter to the Times of London. 
</P>
<P>
"What possible objection can there be if one person, of their own free will and 
without duress, should sell their kidney to someone else?" he asked. "Nor is 
there any wrong done by the middleman who makes a profit out of this 
transaction. The seller is able to indulge in a few of the good things in life. 
The buyer may well be paying to survive."

EX-GEN. TEIICHI SUZUKI OF JAPAN; WAR CRIMINAL PARDONED IN 1958

<P>
Teiichi Suzuki, a former army general who helped plan Japan's economy during 
World War II and later was imprisoned as a war criminal, died of heart failure 
Saturday, his family said. He was 100. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki, who served as a lieutenant general in the Imperial Army, was the last 
surviving member of a group of top leaders convicted of war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
He was the primary planner of Japan's wartime economy, serving as state 
minister of the Planning Board from 1941 to 1943. After Japan's defeat in World 
War II in 1945, Suzuki stood trial along with wartime Prime Minister Hideki 
Tojo and other Japanese leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki was given a life sentence by the International Military Tribunal for the 
Far East in 1948, but he was released on parole from Sugamo Prison for war 
criminals in Tokyo in 1955 and given a full pardon in 1958. The trial of 28 
wartime Japanese leaders, charged with conspiracy to wage war and negligence in 
preventing war crimes, began on May 3, 1946, lasted 417 days, and cost $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 28 were condemned and hanged Dec. 23, 1948, including Tojo, who 
bungled a suicide attempt when he was about to be arrested. The others were 
Gens. Seishiro Itagaki, Kenji Doihara, Heitaro Kimura, Iwane Matsui and Akira 
Muto; and Koki Hirota, the only civilian. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 Declared Insane, 2 Died 
</P>
<P>
Among the remaining 21 defendants, one was declared insane, and Yosuke 
Matsuoka, a U.S.-educated former foreign minister, and Adm. Osami Nagano died 
of illness while the trials were in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Five died while serving prison terms, and the others, including Suzuki, were 
paroled after serving part of their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki, after briefly returning to government service after his pardon, dropped 
from public view and refused to meet reporters.

BENNETT PITCHES ENCINO-CRESPI TO LEGION WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Encino-Crespi Coach Scott Muckey was casually engaged in postgame conversation 
Saturday when his ace pitcher, side-arming right-hander Dan Carroll, wandered 
by wearing shower clogs and mumbled something unintelligible. 
</P>
<P>
"What was he talking about?" Muckey asked a pair of bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
"Couldn't tell," they answered in unison. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn side-armers," said a grinning Muckey, who is also the baseball coach at 
Crespi High. "They're almost as bad as lefties." 
</P>
<P>
And when you don't have any lefties, side-armers will have to suffice, and 
nobody develops them better than Muckey, who used yet another side-arming 
convert to beat Woodland Hills East, 6-3, in a District 20 Western Division 
game at Taft High. 
</P>
<P>
Encino-Crespi (12-8) and East (13-8) will play again at 5 p.m. today at Valley 
College to decide which team will advance to the playoffs as the second-place 
team from the Western Division. The second game of Saturday's scheduled 
doubleheader was canceled when the umpires left after the opener was completed 
and replacements could not be found. 
</P>
<P>
Muckey's latest project at Crespi is right-hander Pat Bennett who, by his own 
admission, "wasn't getting it done at all throwing overhand" and was converted 
last fall. Bennett (4-2), however, has made definite progress since the switch 
and he torpedoed East on eight hits to win for the second time in five days. 
</P>
<P>
"He changed me over last winter," Bennett said of Muckey, who asked Carroll to 
throw side-arm two seasons ago. "At the time, he didn't really know where I fit 
in. I was doing some catching, playing third base, and as a pitcher, I didn't 
have it." 
</P>
<P>
Against East, Bennett had plenty, especially early when he faced only 10 
batters in the first three innings. Even when East scored a run in the fourth 
to close to within 4-1, Bennett didn't seem to be in serious trouble; the East 
rally consisted of an infield single, a ground single up the middle, a bunt 
single and a hit batter with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of two Encino-Crespi errors, East added two runs in the sixth to 
cut the lead to 6-3, but Bennett, who will be a senior in the fall, retired the 
side in order in the seventh to give his team its fifth win in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's only jam came in the sixth. After nearly being hit by a pitch, 
leadoff batter Glenn Nahmias tripled to left-center, then started jawing at 
Bennett after arriving at third base. Thirty seconds later, the jawing stopped 
and Nahmias was back in the dugout after being picked off. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, East scored two runs in the inning, which finally ended when 
Bennett got Rich Shapiro to ground into a 4-6-3 double play, the third of the 
game for Encino-Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
Red hot Vic Seper helped give Encino-Crespi a 3-0 lead in the first with a 
run-scoring single to right. Seper drove in another run in the third with a 
double to left-center to give him 10 hits in as many at-bats. The streak was 
halted in the fourth when Seper grounded out with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
After allowing three runs on four hits in the first, right-hander Eric Rothman 
(3-3) settled down and allowed only one earned run over the next six innings. A 
fielding miscue in the sixth finally did him in. 
</P>
<P>
With the bases loaded and two out, Encino-Crespi's Mark Maurizi lofted a fly 
ball to shallow right field. Second baseman Mike Kimelman, center fielder Jason 
Shapiro and right fielder Rich Shapiro converged, but Rich Shapiro dropped the 
ball for a two-base error. Two runs scored to give Encino-Crespi a 6-1 lead.

WELCOMING THE CHALLENGE, NEW COACH MARK LOVETT BOLDLY PREDICTS A RESURRECTION 
OF THE ONCE-PROUD FOOTBALL PROGRAM AT ST. GENEVIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dusk is drawing a golden curtain on a summer's day at the Alemany High athletic 
field, but in a huddle of St. Genevieve football players the mood is dark. 
</P>
<P>
The Valiants have just been humbled by the home team in their first 
passing-league exhibition of the season. There were touchdowns at the end of 
many an Indian rainbow on this evening, leaving Valiant defenders to grapple 
with their own despair and self-doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mark Lovett had feared such a performance, but he also had predicted it. 
And now, standing amid the gloom of his weary charges, he would attempt to 
explain it. 
</P>
<P>
"Folks, they're supposed to beat the crap out of us," he begins. "They're 
Division I and we're Division VII. . . . We're just starting, just getting 
ready. This is just practice. There's no reason to get depressed about it." 
</P>
<P>
But depressed they are, and who could blame them? 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve, which had qualified for the playoffs in nine of the previous 12 
seasons, ended up 1-8 last season and was outscored, 255-38, in its losses. So 
excuse the returning players who might be experiencing a moment of doubt. Or 
worse, a flashback. 
</P>
<P>
They have been told -- promised, in fact -- by their new coach that they won't 
suffer through a similar season again. Was it a lie? 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous for the guys, but I think after our little talk they 
understand," Lovett would later confide. "That's the way it's supposed to go 
the first time around." 
</P>
<P>
His statement is made confidently. At the very least, it seems, he has 
convinced himself. 
</P>
<P>
Lovett, 34, was selected to coach St. Genevieve from a field of almost two 
dozen candidates, and not necessarily because of his background as an assistant 
the past three seasons at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
He was hired largely because he is a true optimist -- one who sees the world 
through rose-colored glasses. In Lovett's case, the shades likely are not only 
rose-tinted but also framed in a funky pattern. 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve's new coach has a well-developed comedic side to his personality, 
and that might come in handy because he has inherited what is left from a team 
that managed to score in double figures only twice. 
</P>
<P>
At last season's end, only 18 varsity players were suiting up for games. There 
had been twice that many for the Valiants' opener. 
</P>
<P>
So imagine Lovett's surprise when 61 players -- the majority of them varsity 
candidates -- showed up for his first team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of people there who weren't going to play football before," 
says Ernest Schneider, a starter on defense last season. "I think everyone 
wanted to see what our new coach was like." 
</P>
<P>
What they witnessed was half Knute Rockne, half Jerry Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"I had all my notes," Lovett says. "Before I went in I went over everything I 
wanted to say. I always do when I'm going to be talking somewhere. Funny thing 
is, I never end up looking at them. I just start going." 
</P>
<P>
His introduction was part fire and brimstone, part slapstick comedy. "I wanted 
to be a little funny so they wouldn't think I was a tight . . .," Lovett says. 
</P>
<P>
He cracked one-liners as he outlined his plans to crack the whip. He got down 
in a lineman's stance. He told them exactly what they were going to do to all 
those teams who had kicked sod in their face masks. 
</P>
<P>
And as his performance continued, Lovett could see his audience warming to the 
task. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys in the back were going, 'Uh, Uh. Yeah! That's right!' " Lovett says. "As 
soon as I saw that, I knew I had them." 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, the players found, their new mentor was enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out of the room all wanting to put on pads and start playing," 
Schneider says. 
</P>
<P>
Lovett promises the "New Valiants" are going to play wide open on offense, 
"knock the crap out of people" on defense, win, and have fun. And not 
necessarily in that order. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told, 'Coach, you win three games and you'll be a hero,' " Lovett 
says. "I said, 'Hey, we're going to win more than that!' We're going to win 
most of our games. I promise you we'll be over .500. We do that and we're going 
to blow this school away." 
</P>
<P>
He had the profile of Dom DeLuise but could show the intensity of Woody Hayes, 
and, better still, he wore shorts when he taught history class and the school's 
administration dared not say a word about it. 
</P>
<P>
His name was Mr. Whiskeyman and he was a football coach at Elkins Park Junior 
High in Cheltonham Township, Pa. There was another coach, too. Mr. Landau, a 
former professional football player. Same disposition. Same attire. 
</P>
<P>
They were the stuff of which idols are made. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Whiskeyman, he was like a Lombardi-type guy, except with a big gut, and, 
God, he was so emotional," Lovett says nostalgically. "These guys, I just liked 
their mannerisms I guess, because I decided right then that coaching football 
and teaching was what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
It took more than 20 years, but Lovett has accomplished his stated intention. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Whiskeyman would surely be proud -- particularly if he knew what had 
happened after Lovett left Elkins Park Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
Mumford High looked ominous and had a reputation to match. The walls of the 
three-story Detroit schoolhouse were of blue marbled brick and it was 
surrounded by spike-tipped black wrought iron. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a cop on every floor to make sure kids were going to class," Lovett 
says. "It was just after the Detroit riots, so things were a little crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Mumford was an all-black school, an environment that was completely foreign to 
that which Lovett had experienced in Cheltonham. "My junior high school was 
about 95% Jewish," Lovett says. "There were only three black kids in the whole 
school when I was in seventh grade." 
</P>
<P>
The Lovett family left Pennsylvania for Detroit in 1969 when Mark's father got 
a job with Motown Records. It didn't take long before Mark got a taste of what 
life would be like in the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
His first street brawl took place before he ever enrolled in school. He had 
been playing sandlot football with some friends from Mumford against a group 
from Cooley High. 
</P>
<P>
Lovett says the rival team reacted to his scoring the game-winning touchdown by 
pulling out knives and picking a fight. The Mumford team backed off and headed 
for home, being careful to stay together as a group on their walk. All except 
for Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
"I went down another block," he says. "I was just going slow, feeling good 
because we won. I was on this little Stingray bike that couldn't go very fast 
because it had these great big sprockets. And I'm just cruisin', you know, when 
I hear this (noise), so I turn around and there must have been 60 guys, a gang, 
coming after me. 
</P>
<P>
"So I'm hitting those pedals as fast as I can, but the bike's not going 
anywhere because it's got these big sprockets, and I got about 50 yards before 
they caught me. They said, 'We hear you're a new guy from Philadelphia. You're 
going to Mumford, huh? Well, here's your initiation.' Boom! They just started 
hammering me." 
</P>
<P>
Lovett's version of what happened next includes a rather gallant, if fruitless, 
attempt to fight back. The fight ended when the police arrived, but he had 
already been beaten up and thrown to the ground with the bike on top of him. 
</P>
<P>
"They all took off," Lovett says, "but I said, 'That's all right. I'll get them 
when we get to prime time,' " which meant during the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
But Lovett lost that battle, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Mumford had a good football field, but the team stunk," he says. "I remember 
one play when I was getting ready to call a punt on center snap and the guys 
are looking up in the stands showing off their uniforms. 'Heeey bab-ee, I'm 
playing today.' I'm back there saying, 'Hey, guys, let's go.' And they're like 
'Shut up, man. I'm trying to show my girl this here uniform.' 
</P>
<P>
"We lost almost every game, and after every game there was a fight, and we 
usually lost those, too." 
</P>
<P>
The following year he was back in a more tranquil setting. His father was 
transferred again, this time to Los Angeles. The family settled in Woodland 
Hills and Lovett attended El Camino Real High. 
</P>
<P>
Again, he was one of the few black kids in school -- and the only one on the 
football team. But he fit right in and went on to help the team to its first 
league championship. 
</P>
<P>
Lovett, a running back, still holds the school record for longest run from 
scrimmage, 92 yards against Reseda his junior year. Mark and his girlfriend, 
Pam, were selected "Class Couple." Life was good again. He accepted a football 
scholarship to Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Kush was so charming during Lovett's recruiting visit. He would meet 
Coach Frank Kush a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
"The stories?" Lovett says. "They're all true. (Kush) used the Army and Marines 
approach -- we're going to lure you in and once you're here, we're going to 
beat you down until there's nothing left except for bones. It was pure hell." 
</P>
<P>
Five years of it. "But we all stuck together," Lovett says. "We had to because 
we all knew that guy was going to put us through the same kind of hell." 
</P>
<P>
There was a redshirt year, then a season of mostly sitting on the bench, 
followed by three as a 6-foot-1, 210-pound starter at fullback. Lovett says he 
almost quit as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd dress for games and stand on the sidelines and try to dirty my pants to 
look like I was playing," Lovett says. "There was some old lady, an avid ASU 
fan I guess, who sat right behind our bench. 'Hey Lovett, how come you never 
play?' she'd say. I was like, 'Come on lady, leave me alone.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kush gave him similar treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't until my junior year he called me Mark," Lovett says. "I was '21' 
for three years. 'Hey, 21! You, 21, get over here!' Finally, my junior year I 
had a great block on Aaron Kyle, who ended up playing for the Dallas Cowboys. 
Just blew his butt off to the sideline and our running back was gone. I came 
off the field and Kush says, 'Great block, Mark.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lovett grabs his heart. "I was like, 'Whoa, what a compliment! That's it, I 
don't want to play any more today. I'm done. I don't even need to score a 
touchdown today.' The man called me by my first name!" 
</P>
<P>
As unhappy as he was at ASU -- even as a starter -- Lovett never let it be 
known to Kush. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always taught to do what the coach said. I was kind of a stooge guy," 
Lovett says. "I started, but every time he wanted to use me as an example, he 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Lovett recalls one instance in particular. He had been selected team captain 
for a game against Brigham Young during his junior season. He went out for the 
coin toss, stayed in for one play and was replaced by a freshman. Then another 
freshman started alternating with the first freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm standing on the sidelines, captain of the damn team, and thinking, 'What 
are you doing to me?' " Lovett says. 
</P>
<P>
"If I tried to sit down on the bench, he'd say, 'No, you stay right here.' So 
I'm walking up the sideline like a puppet with him and every time it's a 
crucial play or a crucial block had to be made it was, 'Get in there. Run this 
play.' Every scoring down I'm in there making the big block, then I get pulled 
out and the other guys go in. Second half, I'm going out for the coin toss 
feeling embarrassed. It's like, 'What's this 21 doing out here? He's not even 
playing.' That's the kind of thing (Kush) would do to me." 
</P>
<P>
After the season, Lovett's teammates voted him the team's sportsmanship award. 
"You know why?" Lovett says. "Because they said, 'Coach dogged him and he never 
said a word. He deserves that award.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lovett was voted team captain and most valuable player after his senior season, 
but his disdain for Kush's coaching methods grew. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I left, once I grew up, I said, 'You . . . I understand what you're 
about. You could do it a different way.' 
</P>
<P>
Which is precisely what Lovett plans to do with his own team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not as crazy as he was," Lovett says, referring to Kush. "But I am tough. 
It's just that I'm nice to them after I beat the crap out of them." 
</P>
<P>
John Fleming, who coaches the St. Genevieve linemen, played at El Camino Real 
in 1984-85 when Lovett was a coach there. 
</P>
<P>
He was among the players enraptured with an intense yet playful assistant who 
wore spandex shorts -- "pink spandex, checkered spandex, and this is before 
spandex was even in," Fleming says -- and drove a kit car that resembled a 
broken down dune buggy. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, football practice is a drudge thing, especially working out when 
it's hot in the summer," Fleming says. "But Mark always made it fun for us. And 
he showed alot of dedication and love for the sport. He was volunteering his 
time and after his car blew up, sometimes he'd bike to El Camino all the way 
from Van Nuys. Or, he'd catch the bus. I gave him rides home and so did a 
couple of other guys." 
</P>
<P>
But, despite the best efforts of Lovett and the rest of the Conquistadore 
coaching staff, the team continued to lose. In 1985, Lovett's last season as an 
assistant there, El Camino Real's offense scored only one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"You could tell it was dragging him down," Fleming said. "He'd try to stay up, 
but he'd get frustrated because we weren't hitting. I remember one time he 
threw down his clipboard and said, 'Fleming, hand me your helmet.' So I did. 
With no pads on he just went, crack, into another guy. One time he did it with 
no helmet on and he chipped his tooth. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked his style." 
</P>
<P>
Lovett spent the past three seasons coaching skill positions as a volunteer at 
Northridge while earning $4 an hour working from midnight to 8 a.m. as a 
security guard. "I was riding a damn bike everywhere," Lovett says. "It was 
like living through Kush's hell all over again." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors had winning records each season, but Lovett grew increasingly 
discontent with his lack of say about the direction of CSUN's offense. He also 
missed watching professional football on television on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived that seven-day-a-week life in college," Lovett says. "Those last three 
years at CSUN, I was burning out. Right now I want six days and then have my 
day of rest. Besides, I have too many hobbies to be a college coach." 
</P>
<P>
Among them: watching and taping movies, raising tropical fish, building model 
trains, and playing for and writing a newsletter for a two-time modified league 
champion softball team. In addition, he still plays football. 
</P>
<P>
"CSUN never knew, but on Saturdays I played in a flag football league down in 
L.A. at Martin Luther King Park," Lovett says. "Coach (Bob) Burt was always 
wondering, 'Why weren't you at the team meal?' 
</P>
<P>
"Because I'm in a ballgame, man. I'm out there scoring touchdowns. I figured if 
we weren't gonna score any at night at least I would score me one or two in the 
afternoon. But I never told him that. I'd say, 'I'm just not hungry. Can't eat 
in the afternoon.' " 
</P>
<P>
The man's own hand, which is guided by an evil spirit, has attempted to murder 
him. It's time for drastic measures. A gas-powered chain saw -- doesn't 
everyone stash one in the kitchen? -- is pulled out and, after a bloody battle, 
the hand is hacked off. 
</P>
<P>
But still, it lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this stuff," Lovett says, as the hand makes a run for it across his 
television screen. "I'm a real horror fan, so I like all the blood and guts." 
</P>
<P>
In all, there are more than 500 movies on tapes that line cabinets on both 
sides of the two TV screens and three video recorders Lovett has stacked neatly 
against the wall of the Van Nuys apartment he shares with his wife, Gayle, and 
children, Nicholas, 7, and Marki Jenel, 4 months. 
</P>
<P>
"I do a lot of dummying and make my own little tapes," he says. "I'll just cut 
out the best clips from a movie. I like 'Friday the 13th' and Freddie and all 
that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
His scariest tape? That would be the one with clips from last season's St. 
Genevieve games. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is a horror film," Lovett says, popping in the tape. "What I see is 
just laziness. No pursuit on defense. They're just joggin' around out there. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
As he speaks, another Valiant effort ends in disarray, prompting a distraught 
reaction from a coach on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"You see the coach throw his hands up?" Lovett says. "That's what the whole 
year was like." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the guys tell me that the coaches quit on them. I can't really say 
what all happened for sure. But I do know that we're not going 1-8 again or 
I'll be tossing up more than my hands." 
</P>

WOODFIN LOOKING TO TRIM WEIGHT WHILE FATTENING UP HIS RECORD

<P>
Olonzo Woodfin isn't exactly eating up the competition in the Appalachian 
Rookie League this season, but the Cleveland Indians don't seem too concerned 
with his 0-3 won-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, however, is watching closely the numbers on Woodfin's 
weight-loss chart, which became a key statistical category for the former 
Sylmar High left-hander when he reported to spring training in Arizona at a 
Rick Reuschelesque 245 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We said, 'Olonzo, we hope you brought your running shoes,' " said Dan O'Dowd, 
the Indians' director of player development. "I think he just enjoyed his 
mother's cooking during the off-season."

<P>
Woodfin, who was 6-foot-4 and weighed about 200 pounds when Cleveland selected 
him in the eighth round of the 1988 draft, said the combined length of his high 
school, Rookie League and Instructional League seasons contributed to his 
girth. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't work out as much I needed to," Woodfin said. "I thought I was in 
better shape, but once we got to spring training it was a big awakening." 
</P>
<P>
Woodfin was down to 237 pounds by the end of spring training. When he left 
extended spring training for Burlington (N.C) in June, he weighed 231. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd love to have him down around 215 to 220," O'Dowd said. "That's what he 
needs to do to take the pressure off his legs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure when I go down and see him (this) week, he'll be lean and mean." 
</P>
<P>
Woodfin says he currently weighs 225. By the end of the season he also hopes to 
trim some of the fat from his 5.40 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"Olonzo's got a good arm and the aptitude to learn," O'Dowd said. "He's just 
going through a maturing process." 
</P>
<P>
Happy Trapper: The players who don uniforms of unaffiliated minor league teams 
most often do so to catch the eye of major league organizations that looked the 
other way during the draft. 
</P>
<P>
But Mike Bible is having so much fun playing for the Salt Lake Trappers of the 
Pioneer Rookie League, he is not so sure that being sold to one of the 26 major 
league franchises would be a step up. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't ask for a better place to play," said Bible, a catcher from Saugus 
High and College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Bible, 6-1, 195 pounds, signed with the Trappers after missing the 1989 college 
season -- what would have been his junior year -- because of financial and 
transcript problems at Sonoma State. 
</P>
<P>
"I was up there (Sonoma) for about three weeks going to class, practicing with 
the team and working as a waiter until 2 o'clock in the morning," said Bible, 
who had been selected by the Houston Astros in the 27th round of the 1987 
draft. "I couldn't keep doing it." 
</P>
<P>
"I came home to Saugus, went to a couple of tryouts and didn't get any answers. 
They said, 'We'll call you if something turns up.' 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people kept telling me I should probably think of doing something 
else. To their faces I'd say, 'Yeah, you're probably right.' But inside, I knew 
I wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
In April, Trapper Manager Barry Moss was scouting a game at Loyola Marymount 
when he learned from a parent of one of the players that Bible was available. 
</P>
<P>
After a private tryout at College of the Canyons -- he had batted .500 as a 
freshman and .255 as a sophomore for the school -- Bible signed to become a 
Trapper. He was batting .270 before suffering a sprained ankle Wednesday night 
that will sideline him for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's doing a great job and I expect him to hit even better than he has so 
far," Moss said. "Usually, we have to take the college senior. So it's good for 
Mike and also good for us. It's an ideal situation for a Trapper." 
</P>
<P>
Riscen rehab: While Bible has only recently joined the Trappers' disabled, 
former Canyons battery-mate Fred Riscen is hoping to finally become activated. 
</P>
<P>
Riscen, a left-handed pitcher, was 6-1 with 3.53 ERA for the Trappers last 
season before missing his last few starts because of arm problems that have 
plagued him since his junior season at Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
On April 20, Riscen had arthroscopic surgery that revealed an anterior 
instability in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no tears or anything, but the muscles in front of the shoulder are 
weak," said Riscen, who attended Granada Hills High. "It's just the result of 
too much throwing. It just caught up to me. When I was younger, I could throw 
everyday and I never iced or anything." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has not pitched an inning this season, Riscen has been throwing in 
the bullpen and working with light weights to strengthen the arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a workout last Thursday in Salt Lake and threw harder than I did all 
last year," Riscen said. "But I can't get too excited because it's day to day. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't get it going pretty soon it could be it for me. I appreciate 
everything they've done, but I don't like to just be sitting around. I'm 
getting paid and I haven't done nothing yet." 
</P>
<P>
Travelogue: Doug Simons, normally a pitcher who has few problems with location, 
has run into trouble since being promoted from Visalia of the California League 
to Orlando (Fla.) of the double-A Southern League. 
</P>
<P>
Simons has found the strike zone -- he has a 2-1 record and had compiled a 1.47 
ERA after four starts -- he just can't find his luggage, which was shipped via 
United Parcel Service more than two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I took plenty of clothes when I flew out," said Simons, who played at 
Calabasas High and Pepperdine. "But my wife drove out and there wasn't a lot of 
room for her clothes in our little Honda. She's been living off three pairs of 
shorts and my shirts until our things get here. 
</P>
<P>
"The other problem is we have to eat out every night because we don't have any 
cooking utensils. We keep thinking, 'This is the day our stuff is going to 
come.' We finally went out and bought a pan."

DISTRICT POWERS STOCK WEST ALL-STARS' ROSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Putting players from powerhouses Woodland Hills West and Newhall-Saugus on the 
squad that will face the East team in today's American Legion District 20 
all-star game is like staging an all-star broadcast battle between Reagan and 
Scully: It just doesn't seem even. 
</P>
<P>
But take it from a partial observer: It's still a tough call to make. 
</P>
<P>
"The West may have more name recognition-type players," Newhall-Saugus Coach 
Tom Pedersen said, "but there are some pretty good ballplayers in the East, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Newhall-Saugus (17-5) and Woodland Hills West (21-3) own the best records in 
the district and players from both are on what is a potentially explosive West 
team. The starting time for the game at Birmingham High is 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no real formula to it," District Commissioner Mel Swerdling said of 
how rosters are filled. "I just try to get as much exposure for as many players 
in the game as possible. It usually turns out pretty even." 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills West sends pitchers Pat Treend and Lance Gibson and its infield 
of Ryan McGuire (1B), Paul Geller (2B), Rick Banuelos (SS) and Del Marine (3B). 
</P>
<P>
Newhall-Saugus sends George Lopata (1B), Corey Byars (3B), Brad Anderson (SS) 
and Ben Ealy (OF). 
</P>
<P>
Panorama City, champion of the Eastern Division, will be represented on the 
East roster by five players: unbeaten right-handers Roland De La Maza (6-0) and 
Dave Unter (5-0), and Joe Cascione (2B), Shane Wight (SS) and Dave Garcia (OF). 
Sun Valley will be represented by the outfield trio of Shad Martinez, Herman 
Murillo and John Campbell.

WEST HILLS OUTSLUGS RESEDA, 29-19 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It all started innocently enough, with each team scoring two runs in the first 
inning. Soon thereafter, however, the floodgates opened and the linescore 
started to look like a ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
West Hills scored 10 runs in the bottom of the second and scored in every 
inning but the sixth to defeat Reseda, 29-19, Saturday in a District 20 Western 
Division game at Chaminade High that was called after eight innings because of 
the 10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-eight runs? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if that's a record or what," Reseda Coach Frank DesEnfants said. 
"But I am sure of one thing -- they should not be playing Legion games at that 
field." 
</P>
<P>
Several players took advantage of Chaminade's right-field screen -- which is 35 
feet high and located approximately 240 feet from home plate -- collecting a 
total of 10 home runs and 17 extra-base hits. Terry Jenkins and Keyaan Cook of 
Reseda (11-11) each hit two home runs and teammate Tom Gibson added one. 
</P>
<P>
For West Hills (6-16), which had 29 hits, Aaron Weiss and Justin Stark each hit 
two home runs and Steve Roberts added another. Tony Collatos had four hits and 
teammates Bill Blair, Ted Corcoran, Cory Gresham and Stark each had three. 
Stark scored six runs and had five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Panorama City 17, Quartz Hill 6 -- Joe Chaparro homered, had five hits, five 
RBIs and pitched three innings of relief to lead Panorama City to an 
inter-division win at Quartz Hill High. Adam Clark had three hits, including a 
home run, for Panorama City (17-4). 
</P>
<P>
Encino-Tarzana 4-5, Van Nuys-Notre Dame 2-6 -- Bob Bookatz had two doubles and 
teammate Justin Bass had a double and a triple for Encino-Tarzana, which split 
an Eastern Division doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale 6-8, Newhall-Saugus 3-1 -- Newhall-Saugus could muster only a combined 
10 hits in a doubleheader at Saugus High. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Franklin and Scott Boulger hit home runs for Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake-Agoura 6, Ventura 2 -- Mike Suarez had two hits and an RBI for 
first-place Westlake-Agoura in a District 16 game.

BANNING BEATS CARSON IN GRID-HOOPS FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM DERMODY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took a lot of effort and more time than Banning football Coach Joe Dominguez 
would have prefered, but his Pilots finally prevailed with a 3-2 championship 
victory over rival Carson in the El Camino Grid and Hoops festival. 
</P>
<P>
Carson forced a second game of the 7-on-7 passing competition with a 6-5 win in 
the first championship game, but an hour later, on the last play of the second 
game, Banning quarterback John Ma'ae hit Travis Davis with a seven-yard score 
to give the Pilots a 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Mainly, it was a matter of the coach calling the right plays at the right 
time," said Davis, who had four touchdown catches in the two games against 
Carson. "I was working to get open and they were covering me pretty good, but I 
got in the hole a couple of times." 
</P>
<P>
Carson scored first when quarterback Armon Youngblood hooked up with Rashal 
Lotario on a 14-yard touchdown, and Bobby Perkins' 40-yard interception return 
gave the Colts a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Banning cut into the lead when Ma'ae connected with Davis from the 14, and tied 
the contest when Ma'ae returned an interception 36 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams' offenses sputtered until Banning started the game-winning drive 
with four minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Ma'ae was a little sluggish on offense, so one of the coaches suggested we put 
him on defense to see if we could perk him up," Dominguez said. "And sure 
enough, boom, he picks off that interception and turns the offense right 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Carson also forced the second championship game with a touchdown on 
the last play of regulation when Youngblood hit Lotario from 17 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Tydus Winans, who had four touchdown catches in the contest, gave the Colts the 
lead on the first play of the game when he grabbed a Youngblood pass on the 20 
and outran the defenders into the end zone. Carson scored again five plays 
later when Kenny Lincoln intercepted Ma'ae's pass at the one and ran it all the 
way back. 
</P>
<P>
Michael James caught touchdown passes of 29 and five yards, and Ma'ae and Davis 
teamed up to give the Pilots a 3-2 lead from one yard out. 
</P>
<P>
Winans scored, Banning's Davis scored and Winans scored twice more for a 5-4 
Carson advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Banning's two-minute drive resulted in a game-tying James touchdown from 23 
yards out, but Carson got the ball back with 4:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Winans caught an 18-yard pass to the 12 and one play later, Lotario hauled in 
the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
Because Banning beat Carson in the semifinals, the Colts had to play West 
Torrance before getting another shot at the Pilots.

WOMEN WHO MAN CLUB DOORS DECIDE WHO'S IN, OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the too-trendy world of L.A. nightclubs, getting behind the ropes can make 
or break an evening out. Those who work the door hold the fate of all 
club-goers in their hands, determining with a flick of a hand who gets in and 
who stays out. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a task for the faint-hearted and it's usually the domain of beefy guys 
named "Tiny" or Italian-suited men with moussed hair. The job description is 
alternately given as "being thrown to the wolves," "on the firing line" or "in 
the trenches." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Front Lines 
</P>
<P>
But, if club war is hell, that hasn't stopped a few women from working the 
front lines. 
</P>
<P>
When Djenat James worked at Nipper's, the exclusive champagne bar on Rodeo 
Drive, she got used to the shocked looks from men unaccustomed to finding a 
young woman running the door. "Sometimes when a man's standing there saying, 
'No, you can't come in,' sometimes they'll take it easier from a woman," she 
says. "But then a lot of times they'd look at me and say, 'Get your superior.' 
And I'd say, 'You're looking at her.' It was always a shock, especially with 
the men, to see a woman doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Caroline Clone recalls the time Richard Dreyfuss came to her club, Palette, one 
night when she was working the door. The actor didn't have enough money for the 
cover charge, and Clone told him to "go in and find your friends and leave your 
ID (at the door) because we have a policy," she recalls. "My staff was just 
laughing at me. I do not recognize celebrities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Men Show No Respect 
</P>
<P>
"Some men (who come to the club) don't have any sort of respect for women," 
says Janelle Thibodaux, who works the VIP door at the Apartment at the Stardust 
Ballroom. "Men don't seem to have any problem with pushing you out of the way 
or grabbing you. They think I'm this little girl, so I'll just walk right up 
the stairs and grab them by the shirt collar, and that kind of catches them by 
surprise." 
</P>
<P>
British-born Caroline Clone is the principal owner of Palette, born a hip West 
Hollywood restaurant in the early '80s and reborn recently as a nightclub with 
a Caribbean restaurant on the way. 
</P>
<P>
And although she oversees a large staff, she makes sure she's never far from 
the front lines herself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to check in and get back down there," she says over lunch at a West 
Hollywood cafe. "The last thing they expect is to see the owner of the club 
doing this. But I never want to lose touch with what's going on, and I want to 
let my staff see that I support them and that I can do it too. I've done every 
job there is to do in a nightclub." 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Clone (an adopted last name) cut her teeth on the British punk 
club scene when she was 16, deejaying at clubs like Louise's and Billy's, where 
the Sex Pistols reigned and she could dye her hair blue without anyone minding. 
</P>
<P>
She came to the United States in 1980 to pursue a career in film costuming and 
fashion design, but found she missed the club scene. "I call it club 
addiction," she says. "Once you've been behind the scenes at a show, you can't 
forget it." 
</P>
<P>
On a dollar bet she threw a bash at a local club that was a phenomenal success, 
and she was off again. 
</P>
<P>
When she took over Palette earlier this month, she vowed that there would be no 
"snotty" attitude at her club, which has different theme nights throughout the 
week, some nights catering to a gay clientele. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Check Everyone's ID' 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm working with a new person, I never put them straight on the door," 
she explains. "They have to come in and train for three or four weeks; 
otherwise it's like throwing them to the wolves, literally. The first night 
I'll baby-sit them for the first part of the night. It's very, very important 
that they check everyone's ID." 
</P>
<P>
Of the ability to work a door, "You can always tell if somebody's got it," 
Clone continues. "I don't want a tough, snotty kind of person. You've got to be 
able to size somebody up in 30 seconds, and if they're too stoned or don't look 
like they're going to mix in, you try to persuade them to come another night. 
Like if your mum and dad showed up and they think it's ballroom dance night, 
we're not going to take their money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abuse From Patrons 
</P>
<P>
While working the door at various clubs, Clone has taken her share of abuse 
from patrons who don't seem to care that she's a woman, letting out strings of 
epithets, demanding to be let in while intoxicated, threatening discrimination 
suits. She also deals with police officers who field occasional complaints from 
neighbors about the noise. 
</P>
<P>
Palette keeps an open-door policy with guests; there is no picking and choosing 
from a mob outside. 
</P>
<P>
But the latest in club exclusivity is being on the VIP list, meaning you know 
the club owner (or know someone who knows the club owner) and don't have to pay 
to get in. "I think the picking and choosing has been replaced by this VIP 
list," Clone says. "It's become increasingly important to people." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent night at Palette, Clone did have her share of would-be VIP-list 
crashers. She was polite but firm with each, even those who came back two or 
three times and insisted they must be on the list. 
</P>
<P>
Why would some risk embarrassment in front of their friends and insist they're 
on the VIP list when they know they're not? 
</P>
<P>
"It's worth a shot, isn't it?" Clone says with a laugh. "Maybe they think we'll 
like the way they look. Maybe they're trying to impress their friends and say, 
'Oh, I know so-and-so.' 
</P>
<P>
"To me everybody who comes into the club is special," she says. "They make an 
effort to dress up, and this is their entertainment. I think a lot of clubs 
forget that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wet Behind the Ears' 
</P>
<P>
Djenat James had barely turned 21 and was studying marketing at the Fashion 
Institute when she started working the door at Nipper's. "I was still wet 
behind the ears," she recalls, "and all of a sudden I was working in this 
sophisticated nightclub in the center of Beverly Hills. It was a matter of 
growing up very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
The club's strict dress code made it a little easier for her to turn away the 
"riffraff" who wanted to come in. And although she says she handled the club's 
clients politely but firmly, she still earned a reputation as having a steel 
arm from her less adoring patrons for her manner of blocking the door. 
</P>
<P>
"Being thrown to the wolves," she says, again using that popular phrase, "I 
learned very quickly to get very tough. Looking back on it now, I think I 
became very hard in order to survive. If I hadn't, they would have chewed me up 
and thrown me over the balcony." 
</P>
<P>
She left Nipper's to become the assistant maitre d' at Morton's, then left to 
set up restaurant operations at the downtown club Stock Exchange and to maitre 
d' in the Stock Exchange's VIP lounge. 
</P>
<P>
After a few months of that, she ran a club called WWIII in Hollywood, which 
gave movie studios a place to host movie premiere parties. There the guests 
were picked to go in, but James worked with a doorman, telling him whom to 
choose. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd cue him if there were important people out there," she explains, "press, 
celebrities, and that sort of took the pressure off me. It was fun because you 
had so many people to choose from. In other places you were really restricted, 
and here you could play. I was interested in getting a good variety of people, 
and I wouldn't choose them so much by what they were wearing, but if they 
looked like they'd have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time for Insomnia 
</P>
<P>
While WWIII was still going strong, she opened a sister club called Insomnia, a 
"smaller, more loungy club" that started to roll about 2 a.m., feeding off the 
clientele at WWIII. 
</P>
<P>
She also worked the door with a man, but took her share of harassment. "A lot 
of words were exchanged," she says. "People at that hour have had a few drinks 
and they'd start saying something. Actually we were more concerned that we 
weren't getting underage people in there." 
</P>
<P>
The clothes she favored included men's suits, or tailored women's suits. 
"People took you more seriously if you were wearing a pair of slacks and a 
blazer," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Modeling agents and casting directors who sometimes scout good-looking, stylish 
door people never appealed to James, who had modeled in Italy for a year and 
wasn't lured by any promises of stardom. "If I hadn't (modeled), it would have 
been so seductive," she admits. "You're constantly seeing celebrities coming 
in, and it's all very glamorous." 
</P>
<P>
James chucked the club life a year ago when she left Insomnia, pursuing a 
career in public relations and marketing and only recently has ventured into 
the night scene again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making the Connections 
</P>
<P>
She was savvy enough to make connections that would help the career she had 
planned. "Also when I moved here, I did not know a single person in L.A. and 
all of a sudden I was working in this very popular nightclub and I was 
interacting with these people. I was invited to dinner parties and broke a lot 
of ground fast. I think if I had been working in a department store, I wouldn't 
have made as many connections as I have now." 
</P>
<P>
She hasn't worked the club scene entirely out of her system; currently she 
represents several of the city's hot restaurants, and may do public relations 
for a trendy night spot when it reopens. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Apartment club is back after a brief hiatus, so is 26-year-old 
Janelle Thibodaux, who has run the VIP room door for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all new to me," she says, sitting in a hip coffeehouse and greeting the 
other regulars who filter in. "I had been going out to clubs for a long time, 
and doing this I had to be able to recognize faces, celebs as well as the local 
who's who about town. Basically I'm in charge of checking passes or letting 
people in if I know them or they're friends of the owner." 
</P>
<P>
Thibodaux kept her nice-girl demeanor for about a month before she toughened 
up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Say It With a Smile' 
</P>
<P>
"Last summer it was a mob scene, we had people backed up and everybody was 
shoving. You have to have so much patience, but you just start screaming. 
People would come up and say, 'I have an invitation,' and I'd say, 'Good, I'm 
glad, so does everybody else so you'll just have to wait.' But you say it with 
a smile." 
</P>
<P>
She still can't get over why it's a life-or-death matter to some to get into 
the club's VIP room, which she describes as a separate room to sit and get away 
from the crowds for a while. 
</P>
<P>
They push and shove, grab her arm and yank her out of the way anyway. "I get 
really angry because I'm not going to take this from anybody," she says. 
"There's no point in treating women like that." 
</P>
<P>
Thibodaux, who grew up in Houston and aspires to a career in fashion retailing 
(she works part-time at a boutique now), did a three-year stint of modeling in 
Europe and isn't waiting for her big show-biz break. 
</P>
<P>
With her tall, slim figure and high cheekbones it's easy to see why she's often 
told she should model. For work she dresses "sort of sexy, but not like the sex 
kittens at the VIP room. Sort of casual, sophisticated, jackets and dresses and 
skirts, but not all dolled up." 
</P>
<P>
And she sometimes regrets having to miss out on a lot of things, like ordinary 
social life with friends in the evenings, that her work precludes. Still, the 
life of a doorwoman does have its glamorous moments, like "when it's a really 
good night and there are good people there and the energy is up. Most of the 
time it's just like a job, but it is exciting."

JOHN CHERRY'S KILLING LEFT MANY VICTIMS; WAS THE ACCUSED ONE OF THEM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

MODESTO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Cherry was a friendly man, the sort who might have thought the two young 
Canadian hitchhikers who liked to drink beer, smoke a little pot and listen to 
loud music were no threat. 
</P>
<P>
But any freeway revelry ended quickly. At the barrel of a gun, Cherry was 
ordered by one of the young men to turn off Highway 99, drive down a narrow 
road and stop at a cornfield five miles south of Merced. 
</P>
<P>
There, with the smell of a herd of dairy cattle heavy in the air, the man with 
the gun ordered Cherry to lie down and fired a single .38-caliber bullet into 
his skull. 
</P>
<P>
Nine summers later, those who would abolish capital punishment point to Jerry 
Bigelow, once convicted and sentenced to death for Cherry's murder, as a strong 
argument to end state-sanctioned executions. For in a retrial last year, a jury 
adjudged him not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
As Bigelow tells it, he is every bit as much of a "victim" as the family of the 
man he was accused of murdering. He spent nine years in jail and on San 
Quentin's Death Row. He'd be there still if not for a defense team of lawyers, 
investigators and friends who came to believe in his innocence and convinced a 
jury of it in a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't beat the system," Bigelow, 29, said in an interview last week before 
he was deported to his native Canada. "I served nine years in prison. I didn't 
beat anything." 
</P>
<P>
But John Cherry's family and friends say Bigelow forever will be a little man 
who grew big only when he took a .38-caliber pistol in his hand, then got away 
with murder. 
</P>
<P>
The family that Cherry left behind gathered last week in the home of his 
sister, Glennis Morris, three miles outside Modesto. Through all the testimony 
and legal arguments, they say, the story of their son and brother was lost. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that they dwell on John's death. In fact, they rarely talk about his 
murder. But he lives on in family stories. His father, Ben, recalls fishing 
trips. His mother, Jewell, recalls Mother's Day flowers. His brother and two 
sisters remember his excitement at being an uncle to their growing families. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Bible talks about it, the death penalty cannot be wrong, say Ben 
and Jewell Cherry, who left their native Oklahoma and settled in the San 
Joaquin Valley in the 1940s to raise a family. But no matter how painful the 
loss of John Cherry was and how frustrating Bigelow's release is, this is not a 
family out for vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
"If he walked through the door, I couldn't shoot him," Ben Cherry, 72, said, 
explaining that he does not hate the man he is convinced killed his son. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had hatred in our hearts for Bigelow," sister Peggy added, "it would 
hurt us worse than it would hurt him. He doesn't care if we hate him or not. If 
we hate him, he wins again. He not only kills John and gets away with it, but 
then wrecks everyone in the family." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the family finds it hard to understand why Bigelow, who admitted so 
often and so freely to killing their son and brother, was found not guilty in a 
second trial, then set free. 
</P>
<P>
In the early and middle 1980s, after he was convicted in his first trial, 
Bigelow wrote letters to the state Supreme Court demanding that his appeal be 
dismissed and that his execution take place. To pressure the state, he told 
reporters from newspapers and a television station that he was guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was open and shut," said Keith Cherry, 33, the victim's brother. 
"I wasn't ready for that (acquittal). I thought it was just a formality." 
</P>
<P>
In a courtroom, however, nothing can be certain. And because of all that 
uncertainty, the circumstances surrounding the murder of John Cherry remain a 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Bigelow was the youngest of six children. As his lawyer Robert Bryan 
tells it, he was the runt, often accused of wrongdoing as a child and just as 
often beaten. He lived in foster homes off and on as a kid, dropped out of 
school after the eighth grade, got into trouble at age 15 for stealing a car. 
</P>
<P>
In the next years, he got into more scrapes with the law, though there was 
nothing major. In the summer of 1980, at age 19, he ended up in a jail in 
Calgary for a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
There he met Michael Ramadanovic, three years his senior. According to court 
documents, Bigelow and Ramadanovic, taking the opportunity of a strike by 
jailers, decided to walk away from the facility on July 18, 1980, for no 
particular reason other than Ramadanovic didn't like the food given him on his 
22nd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
The pair made their way south, committing burglaries along the way. By August, 
they were staying with two teen-age Canadian girls at the Waterway Motel off 
Interstate 5 in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cherry, 26, a sometime carpenter and not the sort to miss the 
birthday party of his best friend, said goodby to his girlfriend at their home 
in Chico around 6 p.m. on Aug. 24, 1980, and sped off for Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
He took his golden Labrador, Jack, $100 in cash, and his roommate's 1973 
Pontiac LeMans. He got a speeding ticket along the way, then stopped as he 
always did at a Shell station for gas and to let Jack run near Discovery Park 
in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Bigelow and Ramadanovic were at the same freeway stop. Exactly what happened 
cannot be known. 
</P>
<P>
But as prosecutors pieced it together, the plan was simple: Bigelow and 
Ramadanovic would hitch a ride, then one of them would pull a gun and steal the 
car and whatever money the driver had. Friends say Cherry never stopped for 
hitchhikers and believe the Canadians pulled a gun on him and forced him to 
drive off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Story Changed Often 
</P>
<P>
Bigelow has changed his story often, though he always has said that Cherry 
picked them up hitchhiking. In a statement to Merced County authorities after 
his arrest, Bigelow said Cherry offered to take them as far as Modesto. He had 
described Cherry as a nice guy, and they shared beer and pot as they went. 
</P>
<P>
When they reached Modesto, however, Ramadanovic pulled a gun and told Cherry to 
drive them on, Bigelow had claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Five miles south of Merced, they pulled off Highway 99 onto a narrow road. They 
crossed railroad tracks, drove past an almond orchard and farm houses and 
stopped along an irrigation canal. In his various statements, Bigelow recalled 
such detail as the men laughing when the dog urinated on a car tire. 
</P>
<P>
He also had said in early statements that he and Ramadanovic led Cherry into 
the cornfield. There, Cherry was ordered to lie down. Bigelow had stated he 
returned to the car to get boot laces with which to bind Cherry's hands. When 
he was at the car, he heard the single shot that crashed into Cherry's skull. 
</P>
<P>
That story changed after he was convicted in 1981. He started claiming he was 
the gunman. It changed again in his retrial. Bigelow's attorneys then 
maintained he had passed out from beer and marijuana in the back seat of 
Cherry's car when the murder took place. 
</P>
<P>
Ramadanovic admitted his role in the murder in 1981, and was sentenced to life 
in prison without parole. There was, of course, a key difference in his story. 
He named Bigelow as the triggerman, although he refused to testify in Bigelow's 
retrial last year, invoking his constitutional right against 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrested Within Week 
</P>
<P>
Bigelow was arrested within a week of the murder, after committing a robbery, 
using a buck knife, in Seligman, Ariz. He and his girlfriend were in the stolen 
Pontiac. They made statements about the body in a cornfield somewhere off 
Highway 99. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 31, 1980, Ramadanovic was arrested in New Mexico speeding along 
Interstate 40 in a stolen truck. He had Cherry's dog and the apparent murder 
weapon, the .38-caliber pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Ramadanovic quickly escaped from custody, and was arrested again, outside of 
Daytona Beach, Fla. By that time, he had an arsenal of five pistols, a 
sawed-off shotgun and 22 sticks of dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
Based on statements from the women Ramadanovic and Bigelow were traveling with, 
police from Sacramento to Merced had begun searching cornfields for Cherry. 
</P>
<P>
With the corn 10 feet high, it was a futile search. Detective John Harris of 
the Merced County Sheriff's Department passed within 30 feet of the body and 
did not see it. It wasn't until Oct. 9 that a farm hand, while harvesting, 
noticed the remains. 
</P>
<P>
Bigelow started talking to investigators soon after he was arrested. At one 
point, Bigelow told Harris, the lead investigator from Merced, that he was 
asleep in the back of the car when the murder took place. 
</P>
<P>
But from there the story evolved. 
</P>
<P>
"If you know juveniles, they'll keep trying until they're believed," Bigelow 
said in the telephone interview last week. "That was my mentality at the time. 
I wanted to be believed. There's no logic to it. At the time, I wasn't thinking 
straight." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'There Was No Plan' 
</P>
<P>
As he told it last week, "there was no plan" to steal a car, let alone to kill 
Cherry. They simply planned to head to Long Beach and Cherry offered a ride 
south to Modesto. Because he was asleep in the back seat, he said, he does not 
know what happened in the cornfield. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Merced in 1980, Bigelow faced a murder charge. His former partner in 
crime had fingered him. The women also implicated him as the man who pulled the 
trigger. Although he faced the potential of the death penalty, Bigelow refused 
court-appointed lawyers, explaining they all wanted him to accept a sentence of 
life in prison. He set out to represent himself. It took the jury less than a 
day in 1981 to return a guilty verdict and then he was sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
On Death Row, Bigelow dropped his claim of innocence and started making 
admissions. It all was calculated to inflame the public, he said, because he 
wanted to force the state into letting him drop his appeal and so he could be 
put to death. 
</P>
<P>
"After a year of being threatened, I got tired of it. I got tired of having a 
gun to my head," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
To underscore the point, he tried in 1982 and 1984 to kill himself with 
overdoses of prison-supplied pills, mixed with prisoner-made wine. When he woke 
up in the San Quentin infirmary in 1982, he broke a window and slashed his 
throat. 
</P>
<P>
"I was admitting defeat. . . . I've lost, goodby.' . . . It was just a hopeless 
feeling, a desire to get out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Trial Ordered 
</P>
<P>
He did not get his wish of death. In 1984, the state Supreme Court, under Chief 
Justice Rose Bird, reversed Bigelow's conviction and ordered a new trial, 
calling the first trial a "farce." The court unanimously found that the Merced 
County superior court judge should not have let Bigelow, a man of average 
intelligence and no talent in a courtroom, represent himself. Not even the 
Attorney General's Office, which argued for the prosecution before the high 
court, disputed the key point in the appeal: that the judge erred by refusing 
to appoint an attorney to advise him on points of the law. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Bigelow persisted in his stated desire to have his sentence carried 
out. His attitude changed, however, when lawyers Robert Bryan and Gayle 
Gutenkunst stepped in with their investigators, jury consultant and 
psychologists. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one case where the ability of a skillful attorney made all the 
difference in the world," said Superior Court Judge Harkjoon Paik of Monterey 
County, who presided over the retrial, which was transferred to Monterey on a 
change of venue. 
</P>
<P>
"From day one," the judge added, "I told both sides that this was not a death 
penalty case. I told the DA that he was making a serious mistake by going for 
the death penalty. . . . When an attorney tries to overreach, sometimes it 
backfires." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the roughly 260 men now condemned to death in California stand 
convicted of heinous crimes of multiple murder, killings of children or elderly 
people. Many others on Death Row have long records of violence. Given Bigelow's 
youth at the time of the murder and the fact that he had never been convicted 
of a major crime, Paik believes, few juries would have returned with a 
recommendation of death. 
</P>
<P>
Cherry's family believes that Deputy Dist. Atty. Gordon Spencer of Merced 
simply was outgunned by Bryan, an experienced courtroom attorney who handles 
murder defense trials throughout the country and specializes in cases in which 
the death penalty is possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time Helped Defense 
</P>
<P>
The passage of time helped the defense. Memories fade after nine years. One 
important prosecution witness was one of the women with whom Bigelow stayed in 
the Sacramento motel. She testified that when the two young men returned with 
Cherry's car, Ramadanovic, with whom she had paired off, was upset. 
</P>
<P>
She quoted Bigelow as telling Ramadanovic: "I don't know why you're so upset. 
I'm the one that shot him." 
</P>
<P>
Bryan attacked her by homing in on her lack of recall, focusing on her drug 
use. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer did seem to get some mileage from a defense psychologist. In notes of 
an interview with Bigelow in October, 1985, the psychologist quoted Bigelow as 
saying: 
</P>
<P>
"Went to the cornfield. 
</P>
<P>
"No thought. 
</P>
<P>
"Shot him and ran like hell. 
</P>
<P>
"Mind just blank." 
</P>
<P>
The psychologist concluded, however, that Ramadanovic was more violent and 
domineering than Bigelow and was the more likely triggerman. Bigelow simply 
made up the story as a way of puffing up his own importance. The defense theory 
was that Bigelow confessed to the killing, just as he would admit wrongs as a 
child to avoid beatings from his father, who died in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Childhood Beatings 
</P>
<P>
To buttress the sad story of Bigelow's childhood, one of Bigelow's sisters 
testified that her brother's beatings were so intense that the family fled the 
house to get away from his screams. 
</P>
<P>
Cherry's family agrees that child abuse is awful. "But what does that have to 
do with the crime?" Keith Cherry asked. 
</P>
<P>
What hurt them was that while the defense made Bigelow out to be a victim, John 
Cherry was made out to be a criminal. Bryan produced evidence that Cherry was a 
drug courier and implied the murder resulted from a failed drug deal with 
Ramadanovic. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and family members acknowledge that Cherry liked a good party. But they 
scoff at the notion that he was involved in any large-scale drug enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't that ambitious," a friend said. Cherry made ends meet by doing an 
odd carpentry job, his girlfriend testified. He never made much, and didn't 
file tax returns; they lived cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
The Monterey County jury acquitted Bigelow in May, 1988. But because of 
inconsistencies on the verdict form, Paik refused to accept the decision and 
declared a mistrial in an effort to have the case retried. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan appealed. A Court of Appeal ordered Paik to accept the not-guilty 
verdict. The state Supreme Court last month refused to review the ruling, 
opening the way for Bigelow's release. 
</P>
<P>
Death penalty abolitionists note that but for some luck, Bigelow might have 
been executed. Although the state has not executed anyone since 1967, the more 
conservative state Supreme Court of Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas affirms more 
than twice as many death sentences as it reverses. Given that record, Bryan 
wonders whether the Lucas court would have reached the same conclusion as the 
Bird court did when it reversed Bigelow's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very powerful statement against capital punishment," Bryan said of 
Bigelow's acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Laurence, director of the ACLU of Northern California's death penalty 
project, said: "Because we live in an imperfect world, innocent people are 
going to get caught up. Unless we are willing to execute innocent people, the 
only recourse we have is to abolish the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
In nine years since John Cherry died, there have been other deaths in the 
family he left behind. But there also have been births. Peggy adopted a girl, 
whose first birthday is coming soon. The elder Cherry recovered from a serious 
illness last year. 
</P>
<P>
"What can you do but put it out of your mind as much as you can? If I went out 
and killed him, if I hated him enough to kill him, I wouldn't be any better 
than he is," Ben Cherry said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the family can't help but think of the murder whenever they see a 
hitchhiker or pass one of the San Joaquin Valley cornfields. And they worry 
that Bigelow will commit more crime. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to ignore it and never hear about it again," said Glennis, 37, the 
eldest of the children. "But another part of you says, 'If I don't say 
something about this and if I don't speak out against this little creep, who is 
going to?' . . . I want him to know that he hasn't fooled the entire system. We 
know who really killed John." 
</P>
<P>
Bigelow replies: "I'm a victim in this; she's a victim in this. There has to 
come a point where it's over. She has to go on and live her life. I feel real 
sorry for her. . . . Twelve jurors found me innocent. That's the standard 
people go by in America." 
</P>
<P>
Bigelow faces some legal problems upon his return to Canada. He had served only 
a month of an 18-month term for a burglary when he escaped. He hopes that 
authorities will free him, given that he did nine years on California's Death 
Row and in jail. He also vows to live within the law, saying: "I lost my 
capacity to be a prisoner." 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to disappear in a small town in Canada, perhaps go back to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
But he also thinks his story should be told "properly," perhaps in a book and 
movie, saying: "I'd be foolish if I didn't take some advantage of the 
marketability of this story."

A SCANDALOUS TOUR OF WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a bright summer day, with a slight breeze swaying the dogwood trees, a 
gaggle of tourists prepares to board a sightseeing bus on Massachusetts Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The bus driver introduces himself: "Hi, I'm John Hinckley, and since I got a 
weekend pass from prison, I'm your driver." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after this unsettling news, a woman bearing a startling resemblance 
to Marilyn Monroe sashays toward the bus. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, the sex symbol practices a vaporous rendition of "Happy Birthday, 
Mr. President." Shadowing her and adjusting his power tie is a dead ringer for 
President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Fear not, this isn't some political time warp, just another day with Scandal 
Tours, one of Washington's newest and most entertaining attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Part history lesson, part theater-on-wheels, Scandal Tours is Washington's 
first tabloid sightseeing show. Started last August, the tour uses political 
satire, with a dollop of "Saturday Night Live," to dig up the vast array of 
skeletons in Washington's closets. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute city tour is historical infotainment, offering visitors a novel 
approach to Washington's corridors of power, where scandals always are lurking. 
</P>
<P>
Scandal Tours is a mud-slinging supplement to regular sightseeing tours of the 
city. It looks at the seamier side of the nation's capital -- its sleazy 
underbelly populated by Civil War-era mistresses, Watergate dirty tricksters 
and Iran-Contra plotters. 
</P>
<P>
From the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol and 
Pennsylvania Avenue, Scandal Tours buses also pass in front of all the city's 
post-card sites. 
</P>
<P>
Leading tourists on this irreverent jaunt is a theatrical troupe of guides. 
Using the front of the bus as a stage, actors from Gross National Product, the 
city's most popular company of satirists, portray such people as Bush, Monroe, 
Oliver North and Fawn Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Each actor mingles with the tourists and shares tidbits of documented scandal 
that stained the good name of -- for example -- former Presidents George 
Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Warren Harding and John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the actors' narration of historically verified scandals are 
tape-recorded re-enactments of Washington's "greatest hits" of sexual and 
political embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists hear Rep. Wilbur Mills drunkenly trying to explain why his companion, 
the stripper Fanne Fox (a.k.a. "The Argentine Firecracker"), has just taken a 
belly-flop in the Tidal Basin. 
</P>
<P>
They listen to Rita Jenrette, wife of former South Carolina Congressman John 
Jenrette, describe her own bump-and-grind congress on the third step of the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
The master of Scandal Tours' ceremonies is the actor playing Bush. 
</P>
<P>
As the bus passes the National Rifle Assn. building, he advises those on board 
that anyone seen brandishing a semiautomatic assault rifle "is just a 
legitimate sportsman out for a pleasant day's stroll." 
</P>
<P>
When the bus nears the Lincoln Memorial a Scandal Tours' guide describes 
Lincoln's wife, Mary Todd, as an undiagnosed manic-depressive with a penchant 
for over-decorating herself and the White House. Mrs. Lincoln also maintained a 
live-in psychic for seances in the Red Room. 
</P>
<P>
Passing the site of the historic Dolly Madison Hotel, the tour hears about 
Harding's gallivanting ways. It appears that Harding used the cover of his 
weekly card game at the hotel to escape into a tunnel to the town house of his 
mistress. 
</P>
<P>
As the bus stops in front of the Parthenon-style Treasury Building on 
Pennsylvania Avenue, a guide recounts the nasty blackmail payments paid by the 
first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
The hush money was demanded to stifle whispers of Hamilton's illicit affair 
with Maria Reynolds. A very thorough treasurer, Hamilton always asked for a 
receipt after he made his $1,000 monthly blackmail payments. The guide dubs the 
sordid mess "HamScam." 
</P>
<P>
Even Lafayette Park, one of Washington's most groomed environs, can't hide its 
soap-opera past. In Civil War days, Union Army Maj. Gen. Dan Sickles chose the 
park as the spot to shoot his wife's lover, Philip Barton Key, the son of 
Francis Scott Key. 
</P>
<P>
On the site of the ornate District Building the raffish life of Civil War Gen. 
John Hooker unfolded. There, Hooker received massages and other favors from 
women. The term "hooker" can be traced to Gen. Hooker's favorite companions. 
</P>
<P>
Scandal continues as the tour motors toward the marble portico of the John F. 
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. This prompts the actress playing Monroe 
to undulate toward the front of the bus, pucker her mouth and coo the "Happy 
Birthday, Mr. President" song the real Monroe suggestively delivered to 
President Kennedy at his birthday celebration. 
</P>
<P>
She then breathily lists the President's other rumored mistresses, including 
Louisiana stripper Blaze Starr and Judith Campbell Exner, former girlfriend of 
Chicago Mafia kingpin Sam Giancana. 
</P>
<P>
As the tour heads for the Watergate apartment complex, it shifts its calender 
to more contemporary imbroglios. Actors playing G. Gordon Liddy and Richard 
Nixon take center stage, crooning a sappy rendition of "The Way We Were." 
</P>
<P>
The one portraying Liddy points out which Watergate floor housed the 
burglarized Democratic National headquarters, and how he and his cronies holed 
up in the Howard Johnson's Motor Lodge across the street. 
</P>
<P>
The tour saves its juiciest morsel for last. As the bus pulls up in front of 
517 6th St. on Capitol Hill, tourists are invited for a hands-on inspection of 
Gary Hart's former town house, where he entertained aspiring starlet Donna 
Rice. 
</P>
<P>
This tour is conducted by an actress portraying Lynn Armandt, Donna Rice's 
duplicitous friend who sold her story and pictures to People magazine. In a New 
York accent she reels off Rice's paramours while urging tourists to paw the 
infamous alley garage door that was Rice's escape hatch from a stakeout of 
reporters.

BEAUTY, EASE, ECONOMY OF FLOWER-FILLED DRY GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
"I used to come in beet red from beating back the grass," said Tommy Steele of 
Pacific Palisades. "Now gardening is so much more pleasurable." 
</P>
<P>
Less time behind the lawn mower is just one of the benefits that Steele and his 
wife, Fiona, realized when they converted part of their large-lawn garden to a 
xeriscape -- or dry garden -- featuring drought-resistant plantings and much 
less grass. 
</P>
<P>
Drought-resistant plants are still the hot topic in landscaping, even though we 
made it through yet another year without any serious water shortages in most of 
the Southland. One reason is that less water is definitely in the future; if 
not this year, then sometime. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the Steeles have found out, there are other good reasons to convert a 
garden, at least partially, if not completely, to plants that need less water. 
Xeriscapes can be less work and, perhaps more important, they can be 
flower-filled and fascinating places for gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious candidate for conversion is the lawn. Steele came in beet red 
because his corner lot had a lot of lawn and much of it was on a steep little 
bank -- and he was mowing it with a push mower. He'd mow it, water it and then 
do it all over again a week later. 
</P>
<P>
After the Steeles remodeled their house, it was clear something had to be done 
with that lawn. "We tried to keep some of the 1940s California feel of the 
original house, and wanted the garden to have that same look," Fiona Steele 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Steele calls their pink-and-white house "The Beverly Steele Hotel" and 
their original landscaping idea was for plantings somewhat tropical in 
appearance, like those that surround the Beverly Hills Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Landscape designer Robert Cornell, of Cornell &amp; Wiskar Landscaping of Los 
Angeles, suggested drought-resistant plants. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew the look we wanted, but Robert Cornell came up with the design and the 
plants, sending us on field trips to nurseries so we could see what they looked 
like," Steele said. "It was a real education." 
</P>
<P>
The plan proposed by Cornell put tropical plants near the house, in a area 
designers are beginning to call "the irrigated zone," although in this case, 
even these doorstep plants are not that thirsty. 
</P>
<P>
The Steeles wanted bird of paradise and palms, neither of which need much 
water, but nearby are plumeria and hibiscus, which do need regular watering, as 
often as twice a week. Tommy Steele vetoed an automatic sprinkler system so he 
could water only when the plants need it. 
</P>
<P>
The ornery kikuyu grass lawn was kept because it needs less water than most and 
a power mower was purchased. "We wanted beauty on a budget and leaving half of 
the lawn alone accomplished that," Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
The new drought-resistant plantings were placed where the unmanageable slope 
began. The basic ground covering is ice plant, two shades of pink, one light 
and the other a brilliant red, to compete with the color of the house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Variety of Accents 
</P>
<P>
For accents there are tufts of blue-flowered statice, dwarf New Zealand flax, 
kangaroo paws, agapanthus and blue hibiscus. Other areas are covered with 
Mexican evening primrose, Mexican sage and Mexican abelia. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of dreading mowing the lawn on Saturday, I now look forward to a 
little pleasant weeding and cultivating," Steele said. "I can watch the plants 
grow and the flowers come and go and there are even enough to cut and bring in 
the house." (The statice is an excellent dried flower and the kangaroo paws 
last for weeks.) 
</P>
<P>
What Steele learned -- that xeriscapes can be pretty -- is the hottest news in 
drought-resistant landscaping. And perhaps it is a sign of the times that the 
Steeles garden won the Pacific Palisades Beautification Award. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is another sign of the times that the prestigious Pacific 
Horticulture (P.O. Box 485, Berkeley, Calif., 94701), a magazine devoted to the 
best and most glorious plants for gardens, is publishing articles such as 
"Designing the Dry Garden," in the summer issue. 
</P>
<P>
In the article, author Ron Lutsko, a San Francisco landscape architect, 
illustrates that a dry garden can also be a beautiful garden. He defines a dry 
garden as one that requires water only once a month during the dry times of the 
year, and he singles out certain perennials as one way to make dry gardens 
pretty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Untapped Resource 
</P>
<P>
The plants mentioned -- jewels like the "electrifying blue" Lithodora diffusa 
'Grace Ward' or delightful silvery-leaved bush morning glory -- make a 
compelling case for switching to a more drought-resistant scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The article also shows that dedicated gardeners have nothing to fear when water 
does become more precious. And they might even discover that those plants that 
can do without are more fascinating than many of the plants that cannot. 
</P>
<P>
Author Lutsko concludes: "I hope that imaginative gardeners will explore this 
untapped resource, take up the making of dry gardens and contribute to the 
evolution of a distinctive western landscape." 
</P>
<P>
Gardeners could see this as their challenge -- to make drought-resistant 
gardens more interesting and even prettier that their well-watered kin. 
</P>
<P>
Serious gardeners, and those who can only spend only an hour or two a week on 
the garden, should find helpful the "Water Conservation Symposium: Xeriscape 
for the Homeowner" at the Los Angeles County Arboretum (301 N. Baldwin Ave., 
Arcadia) from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Saturday. You can register by telephone: 
(818) 446-8251. The cost is $15 a person. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water-Conservation Garden 
</P>
<P>
Included will be talks on the need for water-conserving gardens (by Randall 
Ismay of Landscape and Water Management Consultants); on designing a xeriscape 
(by Lisa Iwata of Land Interactive); suitable plant materials (by John Dourley, 
former superintendent of Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden); the design of 
efficient irrigation systems (by William Caplinger), and the maintenance of a 
xeriscape (by Bob Baier). 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the seminar will be a lunchtime tour of the now-mature Water 
Conservation Garden at the arboretum, which was stunning this past spring -- as 
pretty and flower-filled as anyone could hope for. It still looks good as we 
get deeper into our dry season. 
</P>
<P>
This is the good news: Even though Californians will have to deal with drought 
in the future and with a dwindling supply of water during the next decade, 
gardens will be no less pretty and maybe a whole lot more interesting as a 
result.

WHEN BILLY MET ROB; 
</P>
<P>
COMEDIAN BILLY CRYSTAL LEAPS INTO A ROMANTIC LEAD UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A 
SPECIAL FRIEND, ROB REINER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting in the back of the UA Marketplace Theater in Pasadena on May 31, at the 
first test screening of their new comedy, "When Harry Met Sally . . . ," Billy 
Crystal and Rob Reiner were understandably nervous, their congenital Angst 
cranked up several notches. Longstanding pals, so attuned were they to each 
other's psyches they hardly needed to voice their mutual anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
For Reiner, the fifth movie he has directed and the first to be produced by his 
own company, Castle Rock Entertainment, represented his first undisguised 
attempt to address adult issues, specifically the difficulties faced by men and 
women in trying to establish friendships amid the quicksands of sexual desire. 
</P>
<P>
Having borrowed heavily from his own raw experiences as a divorced man, Reiner, 
who has since remarried, figured that older audiences would sympathize with his 
obsessively verbal characters, but what of the callow teen-agers in the crowd? 
Would they respond to a movie that offers melancholy jokes about inconvenient 
ex-wives, untrustworthy old boyfriends and clashing tastes in interior 
decoration? 
</P>
<P>
For Crystal, the ordeal was, if anything, even more pointed. Having established 
himself as a congenial stand-up comedian, with a chameleon talent for losing 
himself in ethnic accents and facial tics, a sort of Jewish leprechaun with a 
special sympathy for aging hipsters and show-biz types, Crystal couldn't help 
but wonder whether audiences would accept him as a reluctantly romantic leading 
man. 
</P>
<P>
His last movie, the unabashedly heartfelt "Memories of Me," in which he more or 
less played straight man to Alan King, had sunk without a murmur. And though, 
as this new movie's womanizing Harry Burns, he had more than his share of laugh 
lines to fall back on, Crystal worried that moviegoers might dismiss the guy as 
an unregenerate heel, because, in the movie's first few minutes, Harry kisses 
his old girlfriend goodby and then, without missing a beat, makes an obligatory 
pass at her best friend. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy is horrible," Crystal had kvetched to Reiner. "Look at the stuff he 
does to this girl -- he's constantly challenging her." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter," Reiner had said in trying to calm his fears. "They'll like 
you. And that's what makes her attracted to you. You can do the worst possible 
things to her, but, for whatever reason, Sally will say, 'That Harry, he's 
interesting.' " 
</P>
<P>
And so, they sucked in their breath. And waited. 
</P>
<P>
But not for long. 
</P>
<P>
Because as soon as Harry climbs into the front seat of Sally's 1976 Toyota 
Corolla for the overnight ride that will take them to New York and lead them 
into an 11-year courtship, Crystal has a bit of business that leaves the 
audience howling: He eats some grapes, turns to spit the seeds out the window . 
. . only the window is rolled up and the seeds just stick there, embarrassing 
evidence of his masculine callousness. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner and Crystal knew they were cooking. By the picture's midpoint, when Meg 
Ryan's engagingly rigid Sally Albright demonstrates in a crowded delicatessen 
how easily a woman can fake orgasm, the audience had lost control. 
</P>
<P>
"Yo!" Simultaneously, the right arms of Crystal and Reiner shot into the air, 
as if they had made a tie-breaking basket from midcourt in the final seconds of 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"It was frightening how much the audience loved it," Crystal later observed. 
"As soon as the credits started rolling, they started talking about the film. I 
think that's great. I've seen all the summer blockbusters, and nobody says a 
word when they leave them." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
With the advance industry buzz already hailing the $14-million feature as a 
summer sleeper, Crystal couldn't be faulted for any sense of vindication he 
might have. Back in 1975 he had walked off the original "Saturday Night Live" 
when, as a young and largely unknown comic, he refused to cut a seven-minute 
routine down to two minutes. Afterward, as his own career plodded along while 
"SNL" launched successive waves of comedians into movie success, he often had 
reason to wonder whether he had blown it. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, "Saturday Night Live" would put Crystal back into the limelight's 
full glare -- after four years of playing Jodie, the first avowedly gay 
character on network TV, in the spoofy serial "Soap"; after his own abortive 
attempt at a network series with "The Billy Crystal Comedy Hour" in 1984; after 
a disastrous first feature film, playing an improbably pregnant man in the Joan 
Rivers-directed "Rabbit Test." Crystal joined a born-again "Saturday Night 
Live" for its '84-85 season, and his "Mahvelous!" impersonation of Fernando, 
the seedily Continental Latin lounge lizard, became a household punch line. 
</P>
<P>
Now that many of the original "SNL" alumni are trapped in cookie-cutter 
comedies, Crystal, 41, does not seem unhappy that his own career took a slower, 
and possibly more rewarding, route. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel jealous or anything," he says. "I felt left out. It was because 
of getting bumped from the show -- and they were all friends of mine. It felt 
like a blown opportunity even though things were going very well on 'Soap.' And 
now, with this, I don't feel any sense of 'Hah, I told you.' I just feel 
personal vindication that the work is good." 
</P>
<P>
That the part of Harry Burns has afforded him such an opportunity is less a 
tribute to Reiner's foresight (the part was not specifically written for 
Crystal) than it is a measure of the psychic connection between the two 
collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
And for that connection, producer Norman Lear, who first cast Crystal as Rob 
Reiner's best friend in an episode of "All in the Family," deserves the credit. 
Crystal vividly remembers first meeting Reiner, who proved far cannier than the 
lumbering "Meathead" he played on TV. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the set," Crystal remembers. "Rob came out and said, 'I saw you on 
the Cosell show (Howard Cosell's variety series). It was good.' And I was 
nervous. I said a stupid word, 'Yeah, it was friendly.' The whole rest of the 
day, I kept thinking what a stupid thing to say. But that week, you could see 
then that Rob was clearly the smartest one at the table. He would rewrite, and 
you could see he was really good at it." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until about seven or eight years ago, however, that the two realized 
how deeply attuned they were. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting at my house talking about when we get depressed how it 
manifests itself physically," Crystal recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner admitted to headaches that felt like rubber bands across his eyes. 
Crystal likened his to "The Buddy Rich band tuning up at the back of my neck." 
Suddenly, the two were in hysterics. "It was two guys talking to each other 
like I don't think guys talk to each other," Crystal says. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, they refined their communication to the point that Reiner only had 
to say "Rubber bands" or Crystal "Buddy Rich" and either would know the other 
was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Comedy might have been the initial thing that drew us together," Reiner says 
of their particular brand of male bonding, "but now there is so much more going 
on, it is almost like the comedy is almost secondary now, it really takes a 
tremendous back seat." 
</P>
<P>
The late night split-screen telephone conversations that Harry and Sally share 
in the film as they compare notes on "Casablanca" were actually drawn from 
Reiner and Crystal's own habit of comparing notes by phone as they watch TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Rob and I are like Spin and Marty," Crystal says with a laugh. "If we lived 
next door to each other, we'd be connected with two paper cups and a string." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Crystal admits that he experienced an extra measure of anxiety when Reiner 
would tell him of his progress on the early drafts of "When Harry Met Sally. . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
The project, which matured over four years, had grown out of a 
let's-all-do-lunch meeting between Reiner, producer Andrew Scheinman and writer 
Nora Ephron. During the requisite small talk, Ephron began interviewing the two 
men about their troubles as single men. Following his divorce from fellow 
sitcom-star-turned-director Penny Marshall, Reiner wasn't at all thrilled by 
his re-entry into the single scene. So he threw out one of his pet theories: 
"Men and women can be best friends, but (only with) some sort of sexual 
something or other being thrown into the mix. The sexuality is always out there 
-- it's either acted upon or not acted upon. If it's not acted upon, one or the 
other or both will find someone else that they can be sexually involved with, 
and once they are, the friendship will eventually decay." 
</P>
<P>
Ephron, a longtime observer of the battle of the sexes, was inclined to agree, 
and she began fashioning a screenplay while Reiner was busy filming "The 
Princess Bride." It was only several drafts later -- with Ephron having mined 
so many of Reiner's true-life confessions that the director could claim the 
movie was autobiographical in spirit if not in fact -- that the collaborators 
turned to the matter of casting. 
</P>
<P>
Impressed by Reiner's own script readings, Ephron says, "I went through almost 
the entire casting process praying that Rob would come to his senses and play 
the part." 
</P>
<P>
But the balding Reiner had no interest in playing the young Harry. For a while, 
he was leaning toward Richard Dreyfuss, an old high school pal, but Dreyfuss 
argued for script changes showing other aspects of Harry's life, at which 
Reiner balked. Eventually, after considering a long list of actors, he finally 
made the call to Crystal. 
</P>
<P>
"In the back of my mind I had been wondering why isn't he talking to me about 
this thing. Inside I was dying a little bit," Crystal confesses. "Then one 
night he called. It was almost like he had been cheating on his wife or 
something. He said, 'I had to see everybody, I had to go through the process 
just to make sure you're the perfect guy.' I said, 'I haven't read it yet. What 
if I don't like it?' He said, 'I guarantee you'll like it. You'll hear your 
voice in it.' 
</P>
<P>
"The script was already on its way, so I read it, and it was the first time I 
said yes to anything without conferring with agents or managers. I could see me 
having a field day with this guy." 
</P>
<P>
Still, final revisions proved delicate. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to get Rob out and move me into Harry, and that's difficult when you're 
playing things that happened to somebody," Crystal says. 
</P>
<P>
The grape business, for example, developed during rehearsals. Crystal also 
suggested he speak in a patented funny voice, borrowed from a bartender he once 
knew, in the Temple of Dendur sequence. And he urged Reiner and Ephron to 
include a scene where Harry encounters his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
Harry's troubled admission that his wife has left him, which takes place while 
he and his buddy, played by Bruno Kirby, are sitting at a New York Giants 
football game -- an admission that is incongruously interrupted by a human wave 
-- came out of an old idea Crystal and Reiner had about two men having a 
serious conversation in the midst of a ball game. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the idea at Dodger Stadium," says Crystal, "so when the script came 
around, we said, 'Boy, let's put this speech in the wave.' Rob and I have 
always talked about the most depressing stuff while we're doing something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
"Billy always can be counted on to stick a line in, and there's a certain 
amount of that that worked very well for us," confirms Ephron. "But the 
essential script didn't really change." 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with the Reiner-Crystal juggernaut, Meg Ryan could easily have found 
herself odd woman out when filming finally began. But, she says, "If they ever 
thought they intimidated me, it would shock them. But their stature in the 
comedy world is awesome, so that was intimidating. They were very conscientious 
about making sure I felt OK, because it was very much like a pre-fab 
relationship that I'd come into. Usually, everyone comes in and negotiates 
their respective positions on a movie. That didn't happen on this one."' 
</P>
<P>
"There were times for her it was hard in the beginning," Crystal himself 
suggests. "But we're really open people. Meg, we just opened our arms to." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was Crystal who had reason to maintain his own distance from 
Reiner. Married 19 years, he felt he had to work to capture the emotional 
fallout of Harry's divorce. During filming, "I didn't live in the same hotel as 
Rob," he says. "I chose to live alone. Got every sad Frank Sinatra record I 
could. Didn't call home as much. And when I did call people, I'd call Meg or 
spend a lot of time with Bruno. So I don't know if I lived the part, but there 
were parts of it I had to feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
Lending his imprimatur to the finished film, Norman Lear, Reiner's creative 
mentor, proclaimed: "For me, Rob has drawn John Garfield out of Billy Crystal. 
Billy makes the first transition I've ever seen from a stand-up comedian to a 
leading man. We've seen stand-up comic to actor, but never stand-up comic to 
leading man. And it's Rob's push to go that extra step that makes that happen." 
</P>
<P>
Crystal isn't waiting to gauge the public reaction to "When Harry Met Sally. . 
. ." This week, he's off to the Soviet Union to explore his family's own roots 
and, in the process, film an HBO special, "Midnight Train to Moscow," for 
airing in October. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sort of the Ugly American in this," he promises. "It's sort of a comic's 
eye view of what's happening in Russia now. I'm not pulling any punches. What's 
good about Russia I'll say is good, and what's bad I'm going to talk about. I 
think it'll look like what would happen if Marvin Kalb freaked out in Red 
Square." He bursts into laughter at the thought. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, nothing is definite, but Crystal expects to set up shop at 
Reiner's Castle Rock when he returns. One project on the drawing board is a 
screen biography of his favorite among the characters he has created -- the 
aging comic, Buddy Young Jr. And eventually, after he acts in two or three more 
films, he wants to direct "Here Comes Mr. Sleep," an autobiographical 
screenplay dealing with his father's death when Crystal was 15. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if that means he intends to get more overtly serious, Crystal 
demurs. He doesn't rule out straight dramatic roles, but he says he would hate 
to give up the thrill that overtakes him when a daring comic riff pays off. 
</P>
<P>
As he puts it, "I really like sitting in a movie theater and being able to put 
your arm up and do that victory sign."

The universe of art is awash in words. It has become a sphere that communicates 
in the accents of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Except Ed Moses. 
</P>
<P>
At every turn one encounters art that is: (a) all words, like the crawling 
light signs of Jenny Holzer (b) words-and-pictures like Barbara Kruger's 
agitprop posters or (c) signs and images such as those of Matt Mullican. Words, 
words, words. Even the prevailing critical method grows from the analysis of 
words. Everybody is into verbal. 
</P>
<P>
Except Joe Goode. 
</P>
<P>
Once modern art was proof that vision is a language unto itself. Today pure 
painting, like pure poetry, has been capsized by the prosaic. There is still 
plenty of abstract art around but it most often either lapses into seductive 
decoration or collapses into scholastic sterility. One is inclined to 
mournfully pronounce the enterprise defunct. 
</P>
<P>
But dead art is a comatose princess waiting for a hero to snap her out of it. 
Who would have thought that the magic kiss would have come from two grizzled 
L.A. princes who might be considered over the hill in some circles ? But there 
they stand, Ed Moses, 63, and Joe Goode, 53, two scarred veterans from the 
'60s. In two recent exhibitions, their latest works represent such astonishing 
individual breakthroughs as to breathe new life into the exquisite corpse. Here 
is what they have to say about their work and their times. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Moses lives on Palms Boulevard in an anonymous blue collar residential 
section. His place is screened by a big stand of diseased eugenia but you can 
spot it by the beat-up van in the driveway and a peeling olive green studio 
sticking up over the hedge, barn-style. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors ringing at the gate are liable to be charged by two ferocious-looking 
Rhodesian ridgebacks that turn out to be amiable beasts just waiting to be 
petted. Moses comes loping out in a Levi jacket with the sleeves ripped off, 
jeans and soft leather boots. He has changed remarkably little. The face is 
lined and leathery, beard full, slightly scraggly and sprinkled with gray, his 
dark hair waves thickly over a skull that slopes sharply enough to make one 
wonder idly if there is another piece of his head lying around somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
He could be taken for a kindly Hell's Angel or a derelict Beat Generation poet. 
He developed something of a biker mentality as a kid hanging out in Torrance 
and Compton. Later he inherited the Beats' interest in Oriental philosophy and 
is a dedicated student of Buddhism. Some of his friends refer to him 
affectionately as "Crazy Old Ed Moses" but it's easy to see why he has had no 
trouble maintaining a string of attractive young girl friends since separating 
from his wife in 1975. He's been between romances for awhile now. 
</P>
<P>
"The last one," he says solemnly, "turned out to be even more neurotic than I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
Moses' most recent exhibition of 12 paintings at the L.A. Louver Gallery 
virtually sold out at $40,000 apiece. Moses' share must have been close to a 
quarter-million. Yet he claims to own nothing but his house and has neither 
insurance nor savings. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'll get turned on by a fancy car like a BMW and just buy it on the 
spot but it's like some sexual infatuation. The minute I get the thing home I 
lose interest and go back to my old van. The BMW just sits in the driveway or I 
give it to one of my two sons." 
</P>
<P>
Moses will not say what happens to the rest of the money but in the Venice art 
village his generosity to friends and needy artists is legendary. In an 
overheated art scene where name artists commonly have incomes in six figures, 
Moses can still lay authentic claim to monk-like dedication to art for its own 
sake. 
</P>
<P>
"You take Ed Ruscha. He's always been a chic guy and women adore him. You know 
lately he's been doing ads for men's fashions. He's going to be the next 
superstar and he'll just take it in stride because that kind of thing has 
always been part of his aesthetic. For a painter of my ilk there'll just never 
be a moment when that will happen." 
</P>
<P>
He prattles endlessly about fellow artists. 
</P>
<P>
"Donald Doe just about rotted out his stomach boozing but now he's OK. You know 
that guy really doesn't care about anything but art. You give him his materials 
and his jazz records and he'd be happy living in an outhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Moses suddenly remembers he's being interviewed. "Don't quote me on that stuff, 
OK? I don't want to get into a gossip mode here." 
</P>
<P>
He is more forthcoming in his general opinion of current art. 
</P>
<P>
"It talks about our values and culture and gets called art when it's nothing 
but a corrupted career product. If that's art then there's art and there's 
magic. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, the most surprising thing about Moses' new art is its looseness. He 
has been an acknowledged master for three decades. Back in the '60s, as a 
member of the fabled Ferus Gallery, Moses was regarded as something of a 
character. Ubiquitous at the endless parties of that rather freakish decade, he 
had only four exhibitions in 10 years. People assumed he worked very little. 
</P>
<P>
Well, good old Ed. He was real preoccupied. In 1959, he married Avilda Peters 
whom he describes as "a real Southern lady from Duke University. She had a 
poetic nature. She was wiser than I and always a mystery to me." 
</P>
<P>
They spent a year each in New York and San Francisco. In 1963 they went to 
Europe. Moses was fascinated by the old art -- especially Cimabue and Goya's 
black paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my madness caused our separation. Moodiness is an affliction of people 
like me who wonder what their participation is on planet Earth. My mother died 
the same year and it was a double whammy for me." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976 the Fellows of Contemporary Art presented a survey of his drawings at 
UCLA that proved Moses had been making art the whole time. In the '70s he also 
launched a series of unframed paintings that were taut grids of colored lines 
on canvas with liquid resin poured on their backs, partly inspired by Navajo 
blankets, which Moses discovered through his artist friend Tony Berlant. 
</P>
<P>
Drawings and subsequent paintings established Moses' artistic image as 
concerned exclusively with tight dynamic patterns of oblique interlaced 
strokes. In fact he did numerous other things including carpentry, renovating 
houses with architect Frank Gehry at least in part because he needed the money. 
Ever the artist, however, Moses translated this three-dimensional experience 
into his art. Lines in his resin painting were made by snapping a string soaked 
in paint exactly as a carpenter makes a chalk line. He also translated his 
three-dimensional building stint into environmental artistic experiments with 
space and light. These were widely seen by his peers in a studio he maintained 
on the Venice Boardwalk but never shown publicly. They formed a largely 
unacknowledged contribution to the California Light and Space art most closely 
associated with Doug Wheeler, Robert Irwin and James Turrell. The years went 
by. Moses made a series of solid-color canvases that laid a critical egg but 
were important for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a lecture by Frank Stella where he said he started painting by asking 
himself real basic questions like; 'How big do I want it?' 'What color?' I was 
just asking myself those same questions in the solid paintings." 
</P>
<P>
He was represented in a Museum of Contemporary Art exhibition by stunning black 
and red criss-cross paintings that were the apogee of his controlled manner. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, last year Moses was up to something radically new for him, paintings 
of wild, apparently random strokes that look like the work of a Zen ink splash 
artist thinking about Jackson Pollock. Although apparently spontaneous the 
strokes arrange themselves structurally so that they seem to move into deep 
space and sometimes even to float in front of the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
The artist says he vacillates between formalist concerns that he connects to 
Mondrian or Wittgenstein and emotional feeling he links to Rembrandt or 
Pollock. 
</P>
<P>
"The collision between modes ignites other possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Moses walks his visitor to a concrete pad behind the studio. He works there 
Pollock-fashion on canvases spread on the ground, sometimes leaping out of bed 
in the middle of the night in response to a sudden inspiration. He paints with 
both hands, having developed ambidexterity years back when he had to finish a 
show in spite of a broken right paw. 
</P>
<P>
"I like painting with the left one because I have less control and that 
increases the chances of something unexpected happening." 
</P>
<P>
Characteristically his paintings are mixtures of blacks, whites and tans with 
occasional eruptions of color. His strokes are blistered and crackled because 
he combines acrylic and oil paints that repel one another chemically. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing that stuff gives me one less factor of control. I don't want to be in 
control, I want to be in tune." he smiles. 
</P>
<P>
Moses' aesthetic grows partly out of his understanding of Buddhism and partly 
from a self-image as an alien to this culture. 
</P>
<P>
He sees Buddhism as nothing more than an attempt to live purely in the Now 
without either memory of the past or hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls a time when his sons were infants. 
</P>
<P>
"They got food poisoning. It really looked like they were dying. I was 
distraught. Then the doctor said, 'You're young, you can have more.' I was 
ready to kill him. A long time later what he was trying to say sunk in. It's 
not the individual thing that counts, it's the source and the search. I used to 
work on one drawing or painting at a time. Now I do many at once. You discover 
faster that way. 
</P>
<P>
"As a kid I was a displaced person. Nobody thought like I did. I couldn't read 
until I was 14. I flunked the IQ test. I was a 'moron' with an IQ of about 75. 
I flunked all these classes but knew I wasn't stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Crosby Moses' vitae says he was born in Long Beach in April 9, 1926 
under the adventurous sign of Aries. According to family lore, he was actually 
born on a steamer bringing his mother, Oliva Branco, from her little village 
near Hilo, Hawaii. She was from a Portuguese family but since Portuguese were 
low on the social totem pole she palmed herself off as Spanish. His father, 
Alphonsus Lemuel Moses, was an English teacher from Yarmouth, Nova Scotia who 
had a passion for Joseph Conrad and an entrepreneurial urge. 
</P>
<P>
In his late 20s, Moses pere decamped for the Sandwich Islands where he met and 
married 17-year-old Oliva. Alphonsus established a series of dry goods stores 
but finally went broke trying to help the natives. He went to Long Beach to 
import Kona coffee. Troubled times ensued. When the dust settled, Oliva was 
divorced and living in Long Beach with 2-year-old Ed. 
</P>
<P>
He describes her as "full of beans," a sharp, attractive Long Beach Flapper who 
sold clothes in department stores, frequented offshore gambling boats and 
became embroiled in Democratic politics. She dated a USC economics professor 
and Moses remembers endless discussions of Roosevelt and Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
He became a "contentious anarchist kid" who rebelled at every turn and focused 
on the visual world. He loved comics -- especially Smoky Stover and the 
Katzenjammer Kids. Since he couldn't read them he made up his own stories. In 
grammar school he was a regular visitor to the principal's office. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't see his father again until age 14. 
</P>
<P>
"He was this little-bitty guy with a chest like a sumo wrestler on top of these 
bandy legs. Looked like Winston Churchill. I was this rebellious, scruffy kid 
who couldn't read. We were devastated by each other." 
</P>
<P>
Either by coincidence or psychological shock, Ed could suddenly read. He 
enrolled at Long Beach Poly High School where he fought a lot. "I was mad at my 
size. I had stayed little physically so I got my ass kicked a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Ed only lasted three semesters in high school. World War II erupted. At 16 he 
got a growth spurt and the next year joined the Navy and became a surgical 
technician in the Pacific -- part of a team trained to follow invading forces 
onto beaches and jungles to treat the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"Things that happened that would have horrific connections for others were a 
spectacular adventure for me. I responded well in hairy situations and 
surprised myself that I didn't freak out when I was faced with having to care 
for mutilated people. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to talk about this too much. It's too easy to fall into hero-bull 
fantasies. Let's just say I learned that in situations like that you either 
find out you have good instincts or bad instincts. There's no time for 
strategy. It's all instinct. 
</P>
<P>
"What is a painter if he's not a professional into it for career or the money? 
Originally artists were tribal guys who didn't hunt. They made their masks and 
rattles and costumes and put them all together to do rituals about death, birth 
and terror. Terror is the most haunting thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Paranoia goes with the territory. If you develop the sensitivity it takes to 
be an artist you don't just respond to the good stuff, you get it all. I get so 
paranoid I want to go sleep in a tree." 
</P>
<P>
Back from the wars, Moses enrolled in Long Beach City College where he studied 
premed, psychology and philosophy. "My brain finally just kicked into gear." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he wound up at UCLA studying art to the disappointment of both 
parents. He cordially detested UCLA but kept drifting back after leaving in 
disgust. At the University of Oregon he hashed in a sorority and haunted a 
coffee house called The Duck where he soaked up girls, wine, Satie and Picasso. 
Back to UCLA. Off to Monterey. Back to UCLA. Off to Las Vegas with a 
particularly hip girl where he wound up as a lifeguard at the Flamingo Hotel 
and earned a fortune for giving swimming lessons: $20. 
</P>
<P>
These were the searching years. He tried everything to earn a living but he 
hated teaching and was rotten at mechanical drafting. Ed Moses had no choice 
but to do the impossible and become an artist. 
</P>
<P>
In a way the rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
He met painter Craig Kaufman at UCLA. Kaufman, generally acknowledged as the 
most artistically sophisticated of the budding artistic generation, introduced 
Moses to Abstract Expressionism and joined him as a general trouble-maker in 
the department. Both met the fabled curator Walter Hopps and participated in an 
exhibition at the merry-go-round on Santa Monica Pier that included Bay Area 
artists like Richard Diebenkorn and Clyfford Still. 
</P>
<P>
Moses talks of a distinct and often overlooked connection between his 
generation of L.A. artists and the San Francisco Beats. While he is quick to 
point out that he did not wear the Beats' "weird clothes," he did rub elbows 
with Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and Michael McClure through Wallace Berman, 
an L.A. artist dedicated to poetry. In many ways Moses' recent art carrys the 
northern spirit. 
</P>
<P>
He talks of faded names like the Syndell Gallery in Brentwood, the first Ferus 
Gallery behind the studio of folk painter Streeter Blair. His first show at the 
Ferus in 1958 was also his master's degree graduate exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls the '60s when the scene jelled as a time of "real aggressive 
competitiveness. Everybody was into one-upmanship. We all hung out and talked 
painting or women. It was a big stimulator. We'd meet at different studios with 
everybody striving for the better insight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd see some great Billy Bengston's at his place and think, 'I'll cut his 
ass.' but it all happened in a basic atmosphere of mutual respect. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody had any money except Craig, who had this little trust fund. It was us 
against the world. We were the cool ones with a special connection to the 
truth." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Ferus was founded by Ed Kienholz and Walter Hopps, "Bengston made 
the rules for the gallery. He had big opinions and a cutting wit. It was just 
easier to go along with him. He brought in Kenny Price, Bob Irwin and maybe 
John Altoon. The whole group resisted showing Diebenkorn. He was painting the 
figure then and we found that inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody resisted later when Hopps and Irving Blum (a later gallery director) 
brought in Ruscha. For a year everybody shunned him and called him 'The Water 
Boy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bengston and Larry Bell, stylish and personable, formed the public image of the 
Ferus and of West Coast art as slick, finish-festish hedonism but Moses points 
to other sensibilities in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"Price was the most genuine guy around. He just loved the magic of the 
enterprise. There are two kinds of artist-magicians. One does sleight of hand 
like a stage magician. The other is a magic-man like a tribal shaman. 
</P>
<P>
"There are princes and monks. Robert Graham is a prince and he lives like one, 
which he deserves. Everything in his life is directed to work, even women. He's 
the hardest worker in L.A. I'm a monk but we talk together a lot." 
</P>
<P>
"My only connection to planet Earth is this formless quest. There's no genetic 
code for that in this culture. To find the connection you have to go back to 
the ancient and the prehistoric. I used to ask myself, 'What are all these 
aliens doing on the planet?' until I realized the alien is me. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I have this fantasy of owning a big old craftsman house where a 
Portuguese woman is always cooking and all my friends drop in to eat and talk. 
I have two or three women who come and go." 
</P>
<P>
He chuckles, "The feminists are going to hate me for that but frankly I think 
they'd all like to have two or three guys coming and going. In the end, I just 
stay alone and live the way I want." 
</P>
<P>
The walls of the studio are bare. Dozens of big paintings stand in racks. Moses 
hauls out examples from several series. He wishes he didn't have to put them on 
stretcher bars but he does to satisfy convention. He would prefer to show them 
one at a time as objects of meditation. 
</P>
<P>
But the groups are fascinating. Each is distinct as if a fleeting mood had been 
captured on the wing -- a moment in time compressed and sustained over hours. 
Facets of Moses that flash through his conversation come out in the work. Here 
comes a group that is at once the spawn of a self-elected crackpot and and the 
creation of an intense intelligence that keeps art history at its fingertips. 
Sometimes he goes into orbit with slashing works like a philosophical samurai 
in the firmament describing new groups of stars with the tip of his sword. 
</P>
<P>
Moses makes sketches and reworks compositions but basically, as far as he is 
concerned, he is just letting it all hang out, acting as a conduit for work 
that just happens. If most of us tried it the results would be a messy doodle. 
How come Moses' mess comes out art? 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you just have to go through the wrestling match of 30 years. If you 
are a genius you can do it at once. I'm just a fool so I have to go through it. 
. . . "

JOE GOODE: A SURVIVOR FROM THE END OF A TUMULTUOUS ERA

The universe of art is awash in words. It has become a sphere that communicates 
in the accents of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Except Ed Moses. 
</P>
<P>
At every turn one encounters art that is: (a) all words, like the crawling 
light signs of Jenny Holzer (b) words-and-pictures like Barbara Kruger's 
agitprop posters or (c) signs and images such as those of Matt Mullican. Words, 
words, words. Even the prevailing critical method grows from the analysis of 
words. Everybody is into verbal. 
</P>

Except Joe Goode. 
</P>
<P>
Once modern art was proof that vision is a language unto itself. Today pure 
painting, like pure poetry, has been capsized by the prosaic. There is still 
plenty of abstract art around but it most often either lapses into seductive 
decoration or collapses into scholastic sterility. One is inclined to

</P>
<P>
But dead art is a comatose princess waiting for a hero to snap her out of it. 
Who would have thought that the magic kiss would have come from two grizzled 
L.A. princes who might be considered over the hill in some circles ? But there 
they stand, Ed Moses, 63, and Joe Goode, 53, two scarred veterans from the 
'60s. In two recent exhibitions, their latest works represent such astonishing 
individual breakthroughs as to breathe new life into the exquisite corpse. Here 
is what they have to say about their work and their times. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the '70s, Joe Goode ran into an art world acquaintance at his 
dealer, Nick Wilder. He announced he was leaving Los Angeles, moving to a ranch 
near Springville in the foothills of the Sierras. He was decamping, he said, 
because he was, "sick of chasing fame and fortune." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Goode sees himself as cynical and bitter on the eve of that old 
departure. It was the end of an era. The Wilder gallery was about to fold and 
the art world was in the sterile grip of Minimalism. Lingering '60s buoyancy 
had pretty well flattened out. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to find stimulation in the music but even that was gone." When he 
mentions music something makes you think of Roy Orbison. 
</P>
<P>
"There was too much going on I didn't like. The pursuit of money had become an 
obsession among the artists. There was a temptation to join that. I decided to 
reset my priorities." 
</P>
<P>
He married his girlfriend, a promising young artist named Natalie Bieser, and 
off they went to the idyllic outback. She has happily taken to raising horses, 
he has concentrated on the essence of art making and his work has increasingly 
reflected nature. 
</P>
<P>
"It occurred to me the other day that my art has always been sort of about the 
environment and now everybody is real concerned with that issue," he says 
thoughtfully. 
</P>
<P>
These days he is back in town part-time working in a Venice studio on Electric 
Avenue. It's a sparse, unlovely block with three converted industrial buildings 
walled behind a chain-link fence covered with tennis-court netting. Goode's 
flanking neighbors are Sam Francis on one side and Ed Ruscha and Laddie Dill on 
the other. Goode's place has a curious, haunted anonymity as if he has never 
quite decided to either move in or move out. There's a kind of tentativeness 
about Joe Goode. 
</P>
<P>
He's still trim but the face is somewhat careworn under the same old thinning 
rim of blond hair. Seems like Goode's hair has been thinning like that forever. 
He is perfectly polite to a visitor from the old days but now as then he speaks 
softly and seems to hold something back, something somewhere between simple 
shyness and secret anger. It's easy to understand why he's sometimes called 
Lonesome Joe. 
</P>
<P>
Elusiveness has always been part of his art. It seems utterly straightforward 
at first, but then it slips away. To this day his trademark works remain a set 
of milk bottle paintings that first brought him to notice in the '60s. A series 
of one-color canvases that lie on the floor with an attached step on which 
rests an ordinary milk bottle painted the color of the rest. Commonplace, but 
these works are somehow unforgettable. They exist less as objects than as 
memories. One remembers them as being enveloped in an actual colored atmosphere 
that is in reality, of course, not there. 
</P>
<P>
His works do such a good job of paralleling the operation of memory that 
sometimes on second viewing they seem disappointing exactly as do the objects 
of real cherished memories. Revisited, our childhood homes always seem smaller 
and shabbier than we remembered because we have changed them in our minds. In a 
funny way Goode reminds you of Giorgio Morandi. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year he unveiled a series of very large cobalt blue canvases at 
the James Corcoran Gallery. They are arguably the best work he has ever done 
and join Moses' new paintings in giving straight abstract art a significant 
shot in the arm. Wall-size, they appear as nothing more than fields of spongy 
color that nonetheless make a strong impression of combined silhouettes of 
foliage, water reflections and dark azure sky. They carry emotional depths at 
once mature and throbbingly romantic. The quirkiness and Pop surrealism 
characteristic earlier are completely gone so the paintings feel like the 
expression of a guy who has outgrown youthful eccentricities and is now simply 
himself. It is amazing how many years it takes to become oneself and the 
unforced profundity that comes with it. 
</P>
<P>
He seems vaguely surprised at the impression the new paintings made, even a 
trifle suspicious. He says he had no sense of making a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always worked the same way. One thing just grows out of another. I'm 
working on something and it suggests another problem and that becomes the next 
series. It occurred to me recently that almost all my work is about looking up 
and down at the same time and about looking through something to something else 
. . . in and out." 
</P>
<P>
Past work included a series where canvases were sliced with a sharp blade or 
blasted with shotgun pellets. Observers found overtones of violence in them 
that Goode himself does not see. He was just trying to create layers of depth. 
He explains the new paintings -- the "Water" paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to create the feeling of being submerged under water looking up 
through it to trees and sky -- not the literal image but the literal feeling. 
I've always thought of myself as an abstract painter but not a non-objective 
painter. I don't think you can just give the viewer a formal solution, you have 
to give him something to relate to emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
He points to some new works leaning against the wall. "These are waterfalls." 
</P>
<P>
Tall and narrow they are nothing but scrubbed surfaces in dark blues and greens 
that nonetheless convey the unmistakable impression of falling water. 
</P>
<P>
Goode invites his visitor into living quarters off the two studio rooms. His 
digs combine bedroom, living room and kitchen like a spartan bachelor 
apartment. A urinal in the john gives the place an impersonal air. His bed 
remains unmade and is almost humorously reminiscent of his old drawings of 
beds. His images often evoke a sense of ordinary peaceful dreaming disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighty-nine has been my best year. I have never really made much money from my 
art, far less than anyone else around. I've gone as long as five years without 
a sale." 
</P>
<P>
Money, or the lack of it, seems to haunt Goode. He was born in Oklahama City in 
fairly ordinary circumstances. As he describes his childhood the melancholy 
paintings of Edward Hopper and drift across ones mind. His folks were Catholic 
and married young. His dad, Bill Goode, was a display manager in a department 
store and also a painter of conventional portraits. Joe admired him and they 
often drew together but he didn't take it seriously at the time. His mother 
Mary (nee Waters), ambitious and sociable, was the head salesperson in the 
millinery department. 
</P>
<P>
Joe liked his Catholic grammar school and did pretty well, being athletic and 
sociable. When was 12, his parents divorced. Joe and his younger brother Dick 
lived with their mother. She was so busy he became something of a latchkey kid, 
cut classes constantly, signed his own report cards and composed his absence 
excuses. He claims he liked the freedom of the life but it gave him a taste for 
solitude. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he reached high school he had become "the kind of kid mothers don't 
want their daughters dating." He was seen as a schoolyard scrapper even though 
most of his fights were in defense of his sickly brother. He developed into a 
serious poker player who spent sleepless weekends playing with the boys. Later, 
as a poor beginning artist in Los Angeles, he sometimes made ends meet by 
betting the horses. The revered artist Robert Irwin taught him to handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Having finished with high school (he didn't graduate), Goode faced the 
inevitable youthful crisis of deciding what to do with one's life. His 
childhood friend Ed Ruscha had come out to Los Angeles to study commercial art 
at Chouinard Art Institute. Their buddy Jerry McMillan soon followed. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the night I decided. McMillan was home for Christmas vacation. We 
sat talking in my car. It got colder and the windows fogged up. When we got 
out, there was a foot of snow on the ground. I decided right then to go to 
California." 
</P>
<P>
He sold his '55 Ford, came West with $100 and moved into a communal apartment 
with Ruscha and the gang. He enrolled at Chouinard and did odd jobs. He 
operated a multigraph and along with his buddies worked lunch hours at Cassel's 
Patio, a legendary hamburger joint across from Bullock's Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great job. I was a waiter so I could make $30-$40 and get a free 
lunch to boot." 
</P>
<P>
It was 1959 and a peak moment at Chouinard. Irwin and Emerson Woelffer were on 
the faculty. Goode's fellow students included Ruscha, Larry Bell, Llyn Foulkes, 
Stephan von Huene, Ron Miyashira and Ed Bereal -- the first black artist to be 
taken seriously by the white gang that would become Los Angeles ruling art 
mafia. 
</P>
<P>
Goode remembers him fondly. He had married Judy Winans, a fellow art student 
and she was pregnant. They were broke and the hospital threatened to refuse to 
deliver the baby unless money was forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so worried I just sat around fantisizing and drawing these money bags." 
</P>
<P>
Bereal dropped over and Goode explained his dilemma. Bereal asked to borrow the 
drawings. 
</P>
<P>
"He was back in a few hours with $300. He'd sold them all in La Cienega 
galleries." 
</P>
<P>
His daughter Stephanie was safely delivered. Today she's a free-lance 
art-performance film maker in Boston. The marriage, however, was shortly over. 
</P>
<P>
"Financially they were grim times. That contributed to the divorce." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin encouraged Goode to do his own art his own way and get out of school as 
soon as possible, so by 1962 the artist was looking for a gallery. He made up a 
portfolio and was flabbergasted to be accepted by the first place he tried, the 
short-lived Huysman Gallery directed by Henry Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
A poster photo for an exhibition called "War Babies" caused a fatal flap for 
the gallery. The photograph depicted black Bereal eating watermelon, Jewish 
Larry Bell crunching a bagel, Asian Miyashiro with chopsticks and Catholic 
Goode with a mackerel. The table was draped with an American flag. At the 
height of the power of the John Birch society, it caused a scandal. The show 
went on but Huysman's backers withdrew and that was that. All the hot young 
artists were joining the Ferus Gallery but Goode -- showing his characteristic 
streak of recalcitrance -- joined the nearby Rolf Nelson Gallery which also 
introduced Judy Chicago (nee Gerowitz) and Lloyd Hamrol. Nelson's candle was 
brief if brilliant. Today he is a florist in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Goode took a studio on Western near Melrose and started building some staircase 
sculpture. His beginner's luck seemed to have fizzled out. His only sale had 
been a milk bottle painting for $300 and his new project seemed years from 
completion since he had to do odd jobs to live. Then an unknown new dealer in 
town -- Nick Wilder -- turned up offering a show. Goode agreed but said it 
might take two or three years to get ready. 
</P>
<P>
"Would it help," Wilder asked, "if I gave you $200 a month?" 
</P>
<P>
At the time it seemed like a miracle as the practice of dealers advancing money 
to artists was virtually unknown here. The move effectively launched Goode's 
full-time professional career and boosted him into the heady atmosphere of the 
'60s. There is a conservative streak in Goode -- maybe a vestigial scrap of 
Oklahoma, maybe just temperamental caution. Whatever it is caused him to remain 
less crazy and less flashy than the decade permitted. He was part of the gang 
that broadened out beyond the Ferus group to include artists like Ron Davis and 
Peter Alexander -- an altogether colorful bunch who stayed drunk on the decade 
and an influx of cash. The good times rolled but while others changed lovers as 
fast as their sequined bellbottoms, Goode had just two steady girls through the 
whole thing, Julie Wheeler and Mary Agnes Donohue. 
</P>
<P>
He traveled to Europe for the first time and later had exhibitions in England, 
Germany and Italy. For a while he tooled around in a Mercedes but it didn't 
last. Now there's a modest Toyota parked in the concrete yard and he can hardly 
wait for the weekend so he can get back up to the ranch -- to Natalie, the 
horses and a place where things grow naturally at their own pace. 
</P>
<P>
"An artist like Jeff Koons may make a big flash today but what he's doing 
doesn't leave him anywhere to grow. It probably says something about me that I 
like Jasper Johns better than Rauschenberg. I like the art of the past, but I 
respect it too much to copy it. For me, the two most significant artists are Da 
Vinci and Duchamp. They weren't just into themselves. Da Vinci was interested 
in everything. Duchamp had a perceptive vision that let him pull objects out of 
life and make art of them."

BEHIND THE HIGH COST OF L.A.'S ROCK DREAMS;

IN ROLE REVERSAL, BANDS PAY PROMOTERS FOR PRECIOUS EXPOSURE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Sunset Strip stands as a beacon to aspiring rock stars around the country. 
No club scene outside of London has introduced so many top-level rock bands. 
The legacy began in the '60s with such innovative forces as the Byrds, the 
Doors, Buffalo Springfield and the Mothers of Invention. It continued in the 
'70s with the Eagles, Van Halen, X and Motley Crue, and on into the '80s with 
Guns N' Roses, Los Lobos, Poison and Jane's Addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to tap into that success, bands of all varieties -- from 
country-flavored rock and punk to speed metal and glam rock -- have migrated 
here, dreaming of the day when they'll find their names on the marquees of such 
legendary clubs as the Troubadour, the Roxy, the Whisky and Gazzarri's. That 
migration continues today, but bands had better have some money in their guitar 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Under a controversial but apparently deeply entrenched "pay to play" system, as 
many as 800 bands are currently paying club promoters to be on the bill -- 
often $1,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, promoters rent the clubs for specific nights and then "charge" 
the bands to play on those nights. These promoters say that the "charge" is 
justified because exposure to record company talent scouts in the clubs often 
leads to big-bucks signings, yet few of the bands draw enough of a crowd for 
the promoters to make any money. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Hurowitz, general manager of the Country Club in Reseda, suggested that 
most of the venues involved in the "pay-to-play" system would close if not for 
the revenue coming in from these shows. 
</P>
<P>
Whisky general manager Louie Maglieri cites lack of record company support as 
another reason for the dominance of pre-sale ticketing in clubs on the Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days when we booked the room ourselves the record companies used to 
blow a lot of money here every night," he said. "Back then we had unlimited bar 
tab accounts with eight labels who used to pack the room with their employees, 
so it didn't really matter what we made at the door. But those days are over. 
Record companies are not into doing heavy promotion anymore." 
</P>
<P>
After two decades of booking his own shows at Gazzarri's, Bill Gazzarri was 
forced by soaring insurance costs to begin renting out his club in 1985 to 
independent pre-sale ticket promoters. But he believes bands stand to gain by 
the new system. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the promoters, I used to be open only on Thursdays, Fridays and 
Saturdays. But now bands get exposure almost every night of the week and as a 
result more groups are making it big much faster. Look at Ratt, Warrant and 
Guns N' Roses," Gazzarri said. 
</P>
<P>
"It all boils down to one thing. We're in the business of selling talent. If a 
band has the talent and uses the machine that is currently in place it now 
takes almost no time for that talent to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the clubs, however, aren't exclusively pay for play. The Roxy, Whisky 
and Country Club also rent to promoters who book "name" acts and pay them to 
perform because these bands can normally attract a healthy crowd. And not all 
bands play the game: Most pay-to-play activity involves commercially ambitious 
hard-rock and heavy-metal bands, as opposed to the underground and 
"alternative" rock bands that still play for money at numerous rooms around 
town. 
</P>
<P>
The "charge" in the pay-to-play system, the promoters argue, is simply a way of 
making the bands share some of the expenses -- or, more bluntly, help guarantee 
a profit. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Graham, the nation's most prominent concert promoter, attacks the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there always seems to be someone out there ready to take 
advantage of the desire of an artist to be seen and heard," Graham said. 
"People putting on these types of shows are not promoters. They're 
entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
"What they try to do is conduct their business with somebody else's money -- 
the artist's money. The only thing they contribute is their entrepreneurial 
zeal. 
</P>
<P>
"A show built on this premise does not sound like an evening of lyrical or 
musical discovery to me," Graham said. "But it certainly is a sad commentary on 
the times, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Mark Mason is a 29-year-old rock singer who has run into the system, paid the 
price and now is doing something to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
Mason grew up in Huntington Park with his own rock 'n' roll dreams. He 
headlined Gazzarri's on the Sunset Strip for two months in 1983 with a 
hard-rock group named Exception. He was paid $400 a night, and he thought he 
was on his way. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, after going through a variety of other bands and a tour 
opening for Van Halen, Mason approached the nearby Roxy, which for much of the 
last decade was arguably the most important pop showcase in the country. He 
thought he could ask for at least $500 or $600 for a show, considering his 
background. 
</P>
<P>
Mason was stunned to find out that the only way his band could step on stage 
was, in effect, to pay the club promoter to appear at the Roxy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason may have been stunned by the "pay-to-play" terms at the Roxy in 1987, 
but he accepted the deal. His band, in effect, paid $1,000 to do one show 
there. He subsequently paid another promoter about the same amount to do 
another show at the Country Club in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the money isn't a charge. Here's how pay-to-play works: Promoters 
typically book from four to five bands on a bill, allowing each group about 45 
minutes to perform. All acts are required to sign a legal agreement binding 
them to sell between 50 and 125 tickets for the show. Ticket prices range from 
$3 to $12, depending on the date and the band's position on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
If a band is required to buy, say, 125 tickets at $7.50 each, the band can then 
sell those tickets to fans and earn back the $1,000 so that it doesn't cost 
them anything to play the club. But most of the new bands don't have enough of 
a following to sell anywhere near 125 tickets, and there are only so many times 
they can get their friends and relatives to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Most musicians involved in pre-sale ticket contracts receive no payment for 
their performance, nor any percentage of the door or bar. In addition to buying 
tickets, bands have sometimes been required to pay additional charges for radio 
and magazine advertising. And there's more: Some promoters have been accused of 
tacking on rental fees for such amenities as risers and sound and lighting 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The practice was going on at some clubs well before Mason was introduced to it 
at the Roxy, but it has grown substantially since then. Among other Southern 
California rooms that frequently or exclusively operate on a pay-to-play basis: 
Goodies in Fullerton, Industry in Canoga Park, the Country Club and the Waters 
Club in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
After the Roxy and Country Club dates in 1987, Mason and his band, declaring 
that it was too expensive to keep going that route, began concentrating on 
non-pay-to-play venues in outlying areas. But he knew that the Hollywood clubs 
were where the real action was and where he stood the best chance of getting 
seen by the record companies. 
</P>
<P>
So he decided to make his frustration public. 
</P>
<P>
Though he says he was warned that he would be blacklisted at some clubs if he 
launched a public protest of the system, Mason said he received enough 
encouragement from members of such major bands as Kiss, Motley Crue and Guns N' 
Roses to go forward in creating a new, grass-roots coalition of local musicians 
called Rockers Against Pay-to-Play (RAPP). 
</P>
<P>
In the last few weeks, RAPP has taken to the streets, picketing clubs such as 
the Whisky, the Roxy and Gazzarri's. The organization has only about 100 
members at this point, but lots of bands share the resentment of the 
pay-to-play system, Mason says, and he hopes to recruit more of them. RAPP is 
calling on all local bands to participate in a Labor Day weekend boycott of all 
pay-to-play establishments. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't stand it anymore," Mason said. "I had to put this protest 
together. The pre-sale ticket policies adopted by club owners and independent 
promoters have got to go. Not only is this practice destroying a lot of good 
bands, it's screwing up the integrity of the entire scene. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of new bands with members younger than 22 years of age have no idea that 
musicians used to get paid to play music at Gazzarri's and the Whisky. Pre-sale 
ticketing is all they've ever done. Pay-to-play promoters are bringing up an 
entire generation of musicians who don't even know they're getting ripped off." 
</P>
<P>
Pre-sale ticketing has redefined what it means to be a working musician in Los 
Angeles. Not only are bands expected to perform music for nothing, promoters 
encourage them to spend every free moment developing mailing lists and 
canvassing local hangouts with tickets, flyers and business cards. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems senseless for musicians to go out and try to sell tickets every night 
to a bunch of people on the street they don't know," said Todd Michael, 
guitarist and singer in the rock band Rain on Fire. "That's a promoter's job. 
Artists are supposed to spend their time rehearsing and writing songs and 
creating music. 
</P>
<P>
"Promoters don't care about music anymore. They don't care about the quality of 
bands. Anybody who can sell a hundred tickets has a guaranteed spot on a show. 
It's not about how good you are, it's about how much money you have." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's absolutely obscene," Joey Gold, drummer for the rock group Love 
Hate, said of the pay-to-play system. Before his band was signed to Columbia, 
Gold says Love Hate was too poor to pay for its tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't scrape together $15 for a set of bass guitar strings," Gold said. 
"How were we supposed to come up with $750 for a gig?" 
</P>
<P>
Rock bands aren't the only ones who complain about pre-sale ticketing. A 
growing number of in-house booking agents, deejays and talent scouts are 
voicing concern over the controversial policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Pay-to-play is a travesty," CBS Records A&amp;R (artists &amp; repertoire) 
representative Danny Krash said. As host and talent scout for the cable 
television show "Rocking in a Hard Place," Krash is vehement in his opposition 
to shows that feature pay-to-play acts: "It's just another example of how 
musicians in this town are being taken advantage of." 
</P>
<P>
John Axelrod, A&amp;R representative for Atlantic Records, also disapproves of 
pay-to-play promotion. "Bands are not supposed to act as bankers for the clubs. 
Their job is to play music," Axelrod said. "Promoters need to understand that 
the bands are the ones who are doing the clubs a favor by playing for them and 
not vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
But, according to promoters, pre-sale ticketing is getting a bum rap. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody likes to blame it on the promoter, but the bands are just as much at 
fault," said Nelly Alloun, owner of Whoa Nelly Productions. "They don't think 
about all the expenses promoters have. We're just trying do our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Up until six months ago, Alloun booked pay-to-play shows at the Country Club in 
Reseda. During her tenure there, she developed a reputation for being a tough, 
no-nonsense promoter -- one unafraid to collateralize debts by impounding gear 
or taking bands to court. 
</P>
<P>
Although she no longer promotes concerts, Alloun still has opinions about 
pay-to-play: "If the bands in this city could draw a crowd the way bands did 10 
years ago, we wouldn't even be talking about pre-sale tickets right now." 
</P>
<P>
Producing live music in Los Angeles is not cheap. According to promoters, a 
typical pay-to-play show costs about $3,500 to put on. 
</P>
<P>
The standard rent for a club on the Strip runs about $1,500. Advertising 
expenditures vary dramatically, but average out at about $1,000. The price of 
stage technicians and security costs about another $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the number of pre-sale ticket promoters is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing about pay-to-play is that it almost always helps unknown bands 
enhance their draw," Jason Lord said. Lord's company, Jungle Productions, is 
one promoter booking shows at the Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
A former musician once subjected to pre-sale ticket policies himself, Lord 
believes that when a band is featured on a "sold-out professional presentation" 
-- the kind he says his company provides -- its ability to become recognized 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
Amazon, a hard-rock band from Philadelphia, agrees with Lord. According to band 
leader Tom Vitorino, Amazon has pre-sold tickets for a number of promoters, 
including CIA and Marcovich Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first started out, I was in shock. I didn't think it was too fair," 
Vitorino said. "But when you have something worthwhile for sale, people want to 
buy it. The world is run on a money basis." 
</P>
<P>
Some promoters believe pre-sale ticket shows give bands a good return on their 
dollar. "When I hear the term 'pay-to-play' it drives me up a wall," said 
Marcelle Broomall. "I don't think any of the bands on my shows are being 
cheated at all." 
</P>
<P>
Broomall is the head of Hi-Times, a company that promotes pre-sale ticket shows 
at the Roxy. Like Jungle, Sidekick and Future Star Productions, Hi-Times prides 
itself on producing what Broomall calls "stylistically cohesive" shows, 
headlined by signed acts. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, I feel for this situation," Broomall said. "But you've got to 
understand what's going on in Hollywood. Everybody is doing the pre-sale thing. 
I have no choice. I would love to see pre-sale absolutely stop, but it's not 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not invent the concept, the individual most often credited with 
popularizing pre-sale ticketing is Paul Shenker. In 1983, Shenker was brought 
in as an independent promoter to beef up attendance and book at the Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
Back then Shenker refused to book more than three bands on a bill. He sprung 
for the cost of advertising and gave each act a cut of the profits. These days 
Shenker heads up Future Star Productions and spends most of his time managing 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
"Pre-sale has gotten to the point where it's an abusive policy," Shenker said. 
"Somewhere along the way, promoters took a left turn." 
</P>
<P>
As the cost of rent, security, sound, and lighting equipment escalated, 
promoters increased the number of acts presented on each bill. To cover 
overhead and augment profits, promoters began to increase the price and the 
number of tickets bands were required to pre-sell. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Dave Snyder, nightclub business representative of the 
Musicians' Union Local 47, tried to stop pay-to-play by attempting to negotiate 
a perfunctory performance fee for showcase acts with local club owners, but his 
efforts proved fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
"The union has fought pay-to-play for years, but it's just degenerated to a 
ridiculous point," Snyder said. "It's hard to believe, but we met with as much 
resistance from the musicians as the club owners." 
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the pre-sale ticket phenomenon, various non-pay-to-play clubs 
are trying to attract industry attention with unique showcase concepts. 
</P>
<P>
The Coconut Teaszer invites industry representatives to attend a showcase 
called "L.A.'s Best Kept Secrets" every Tuesday and also features weekly club 
residencies for bands they feel deserve exposure. The Whisky puts on a "No 
Bozos Jam" every Monday and Wednesday, spotlighting dozens of unknown local 
acts. Beginning in August, the Palace will host a biweekly forum called "L.A. 
Alive" to focus attention on undiscovered Southland talent. 
</P>
<P>
In-house bookers such as Lucretia at FM Station, Dobbs at Raji's, Wayne Mayotte 
at Club 88 and Michael Nason at the Red Light District staunchly oppose 
pay-to-play promotion. Other venues such as Xposeur 54, Sasch, the Anticlub, 
Club Lingerie, Madame Wong's and the Club With No Name also manage to keep 
their doors open without resorting to pay-to-play. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers feel the pay-to-play system has damaged the reputation of local 
rock clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't count on any consistency in quality like you used to," said the 
Country Club's Lord. 
</P>
<P>
Agrees Dayle Gloria, proprietor of the Club With No Name (formerly the Scream): 
"Before, when a group played a famous club like the Roxy or the Whisky, it was 
a signal to the community that the band had really made it. Now it doesn't mean 
a thing." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem with pay-to-play concerts is that they give headliners a false 
sense of security. Gloria says that headlining acts begin to believe that they 
are selling out venues on the strength of their music, when in fact their 
audience is really just an assortment of individuals who bought tickets from 
the other bands on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pitiful. These guys are out selling tickets to their mothers and their 
fathers, their neighbors and friends," she said. "Sometimes it's even worse 
than that. Many of them are buying the tickets and just giving them away."

One of the most highly-charged elements of "Do the Right Thing," Spike Lee's 
controversial film about race relations in America, is the song that is heard 
repeatedly in the movie: Public Enemy's "Fight the Power." 
</P>
<P>
A tense rap about blacks taking control of their communities, the piece 
includes the lines: 
</P>
<P>
 Elvis was a hero to most, but he never meant (expletive) to me 
</P>
<P>
 You see straight out racist the sucker was simple and plain 
</P>
<P>
 (expletive), him and John Wayne, 
</P>
<P>
 'Cause I'm black and I'm proud, I'm ready, I'm hyped for some amp, 
</P>
<P>
 Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps, 
</P>
<P>
 Sample a look and you're looking at nothing but rednecks for 400 years if you 
check." 
</P>
<P>
 While Lee has been caught in a cross-fire of debate about whether his film is 
visionary or incendiary, Public Enemy itself has been involved in an even more 
heated, if lower-profile, controversy that has resulted in the disintegration 
of the group (at least temporarily). 
</P>
<P>
While the furor didn't stem from the words in "Fight the Power," it did spring 
from the extreme views and politics of the rap group. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published May 22 in the Life section of the Washington Times, 
Prof. Griff (ne Richard Griffin), Public Enemy's "minister of information," 
said: "The Jews are wicked. We can prove that." He added that the "majority" of 
Jews are behind "the majority of the wickedness that goes on across the globe." 
</P>
<P>
Though Griff didn't play a prominent role on Public Enemy's records, he 
appeared on stage with the group, "directing" a small cadre of uniformed 
"security" guards who carried replicas of the Uzi automatic rifle. He had 
previously been censured by group leader and main spokesman Chuck D (real name: 
Chuck Ridenhour) for anti-Semitic statements in interviews, but had been 
allowed to continue in the unit. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-Semitic statements published in the Washington Times were quoted three 
weeks later in an essay that in New York City's Village Voice. In his piece 
titled "The Enemy Within," pop music writer R. J. Smith -- a long-time 
supporter of Public Enemy -- condemned not only Griff's remarks, but also Chuck 
D's failure to immediately disavow them. Smith's story set off a protest in New 
York and triggered many pop music writers to re-examine the New York-based rap 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, the militant Jewish Defense Organization in New York began 
distributing leaflets denouncing Public Enemy and picketing screenings of "Do 
the Right Thing," urging a boycott of the film because of its use of the song. 
</P>
<P>
An apologetic Chuck D soon afterwards announced that Griff had been kicked out 
of the group. The group's label, Def Jam, and management company, Rush Artists 
Management, then released a statement that Public Enemy was "disbanding for an 
indefinite period of time." Chuck D has since been unavailable to the press, 
reportedly trying to sort out his future plans. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, neither Columbia Records, which distributes Public Enemy's albums 
for Def Jam, nor MTV, the rock music cable TV channel, has backed away from the 
outfit. Columbia last week released a concert video of the group to stores, and 
MTV is airing a promotional video of "Fight the Power." An MTV spokeswoman said 
the channel has received no viewer protests about the video. 
</P>
<P>
But the JDO, which has approximately 3,000 members in seven chapters in the 
United States, last week mailed letters to record industry executives 
threatening, according to JDO spokesman Leonard Fineberg, to "break in half" 
anyone who continues to do business with Public Enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Though Chuck D's silence has removed the group members at least temporarily 
from the dialogue, rock critics and the group's management company continue to 
reflect on the implications of the Public Enemy saga. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have generally been supportive of Public Enemy throughout the group's 
controversy-plagued three-year recording history -- despite danger signs in its 
1987 and 1988 albums that may, in retrospect, have signaled future anti-Semitic 
complaints. The group's 1988 album, "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us 
Back," was even named the best album of year by the more than 200 music writers 
from around the country who vote in the Village Voice's annual critics' poll. 
</P>
<P>
In both albums there were words of praise for Nation of Islam leader Louis 
Farrakhan, a black separatist who has gained particular notoriety for terming 
Judaism a "gutter religion." 
</P>
<P>
In "Bring the Noise," a song on "Nation," Public Enemy proclaimed, "Farrakhan's 
a prophet and I think you ought to listen to what he can say to you, what you 
ought to do." 
</P>
<P>
Village Voice writer Smith, who is white, noted in an interview with Calendar 
that numerous critics questioned Public Enemy last year about its social and 
political views after that endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
But the critics, he said, generally accepted the explanation that the rap unit 
did not embrace Farrakhan's anti-Semitic leanings, but did support other 
elements of his philosophy, such as economic independence for the black 
community. And ultimately, he added, many critics defended Public Enemy by 
saying that even if some elements of the group's beliefs might be 
objectionable, they were accurate and powerful reflections of the reality of 
the black community. 
</P>
<P>
While he still supports the rappers, Smith -- and other critics interviewed by 
Calendar -- still feel uneasy about the events of recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a happier world if you could rationalize everything," Smith said. 
"It doesn't mean that their album isn't the greatest album I can think of in 
the last couple of years. But it makes it harder to listen to." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran critic Dave Marsh, who delves into the political and cultural 
implications of pop music in his Rock and Roll Confidential quarterly, sees a 
contradiction in the reaction to Griff's comments. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to a late-'70s incident in which Elvis Costello made racial remarks 
about Ray Charles (and was decked by singer Bonnie Bramlett for them), Marsh 
said, "I think we all went too easy on Elvis Costello and too hard on Public 
Enemy. Chuck D said he was sorry and acted contrite. . . . but people are still 
seeking justifications for being punitive against him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The reference to Farrakhan is not ipso facto, in any way, anti-Semitic. That's 
like saying referring to Germany is anti-Semitic. . . . But almost everybody 
who's written at any length about Public Enemy has had to stick their hands 
into the Farrakhan tar baby." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson George, who for 10 years covered black music for Billboard magazine 
until leaving recently, also feels that critics went too hard on Public Enemy 
and doesn't believe the recent developments should be any cause for revising 
opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question they say Farrakhan's a prophet," George said. "But Chuck D 
was very specific about what they like about Farrakhan. That Prof. Griff is a 
(jerk) doesn't invalidate the record. And Public Enemy was signed by Rick 
Rubin, who is Jewish, and one of their first managers is Jewish, as is the 
photographer that shot most of their album cover pictures, and (so is) their 
publicist Bill Adler." 
</P>
<P>
Adler, a publicist for Rush Artists Management, the company that manages Public 
Enemy and such other rap acts as Run-DMC and LL Cool J, sees a difference 
between Public Enemy's music and Griff's statements in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in the philosophy of any band members that might be objectionable was 
on the records," he said by phone from his office in New York. "There's not 
much to argue with about the notion of black economic independence." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Adler, who describes himself as a "non-observant Jew," has found the 
situation personally exasperating. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very difficult for me," he said. "I have people from the JDO calling 
me a self-hating Jew. I'm enough of a Jew that it hurts, or at least makes me 
reflect, but I've been able to separate out the issue of anti-Semitism because 
it's embodied only by Griff, and I'd long since separated him from the group in 
my mind." 
</P>
<P>
But the JDO isn't backing off from its stance, criticizing the critics for not 
completely condemning Public Enemy. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones who are Jewish are the biggest cowards," Fineberg said. "I think 
they're afraid of creating a black backlash." 
</P>
<P>
And now the organization is focusing its rage on record producer Rubin, even 
though he is no longer associated with Public Enemy. Fineberg is calling for a 
record industry boycott of the producer, who now lives in Los Angeles and runs 
Def 
</P>
<P>
American Records. 
</P>
<P>
"We blame Rick Rubin," Fineberg said, calling the producer "self-hating Jewish 
trash. He is a child. The only thing that will educate him is to ruin his 
career. He could have put a crimp on (Public Enemy) in the first place. We're 
going to punish him for his lack of morality through strong but legal and 
effective means." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Def American said Rubin "is not commenting on threats made by 
the reactionary JDO." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, R.J. Smith, the Voice writer, believes the group has no one to blame 
but itself for the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Public Enemy brought on themselves all the hostility and rage and bad 
feelings and demonstrations," he said.

GOODBY TO THE ERA OF THE CELEBRITY; 
</P>
<P>
CHEFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The dinner party is over. The season of the celebrity chef is coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
It was a phenomenon of the '80s. Wolfgang Puck -- along with Alice Waters and 
Paul Prudhomme -- changed the way we ate. In return we gave them not only 
fortune, but more fame than any chef in America had ever dreamed of. Those 
who've already got it can keep their fame, but the next generation of chefs 
will have to settle for fortune. The era of adulation is over. This is not 
because people are no longer eating out; Americans eat out now more than ever 
before. And it is not because we lack a new crop of talented young chefs: The 
chefs who are getting started today are probably the best-trained group of 
cooks America has ever had. And it is certainly not because the restaurants 
that are opening up aren't any good. The quality of restaurants in America 
continues to rise. 
</P>
<P>
What is different is our attitude towards eating. Good food is no longer a 
delightful surprise -- it is simply what people expect to be served when they 
go out to eat. Americans have matured as diners -- and have become a little bit 
blase about the whole thing. They are no longer astonished by chefs who create 
wonderful new dishes, and they are certainly not ready to worship them. 
</P>
<P>
What a change! For the past 10 years you could hardly pick up a magazine or 
newspaper without finding the photograph of some chef staring out at you. They 
came smiling out of TV sets too, and when you walked into a bookstore there 
they were, celebrity chefs, looking up from the back of bookjackets. As the 
hostess of one trendy restaurant put it, the customers were so enthralled with 
the chef that it made her feel like "an acolyte to the Pope." Indeed, large 
numbers of people were willing to pay big bucks to meet the chefs in the flesh 
at charity galas. 
</P>
<P>
Not all chefs, of course, qualified for celebrity status; there seemed to be 
certain unspoken rules. In the first place, a celebrity chef had to be young 
(which meant that the late Jean Bertranou, founder of L'Ermitage and L.A.'s 
most influential chef, didn't qualify). And, with the exception of Wolfgang 
Puck (who compensated by launching two separate food trends), a celebrity chef 
had to be American. That left out the French (Claude Segal, currently of Ma Be 
for instance), the Italians (Antonio Tommasi, currently at Locanda Veneta), and 
the Asians (although Tommy Tang certainly tried). He (or she) had to be 
attractive -- or at least photogenic. Charisma was a definite necessity -- the 
lack of this important quality is the only reason that Bruce Marder, whose West 
Beach Cafe and Rebecca's were both real trend setters, never got the celebrity 
he deserved. 
</P>
<P>
A chef didn't get to be a celebrity by simply working in the kitchen; he had to 
own his own restaurant -- or at least a small piece of it. Everybody in L.A. 
loved Wolfgang Puck's food when he was working at Ma Maison, but he didn't 
become a celebrity until he opened Spago. The fact that the restaurant made a 
splashy design statement didn't hurt; the unique design of Trumps gave Michael 
Roberts added cachet too. And in addition to all of these qualities, the public 
was most pleased when its celebrity chefs were well educated and articulate as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, though, a celebrity chef had to stake out new territory. 
There was the California Cuisine crew (Puck at Spago, Michael McCarty and his 
bunch at Michael's, Michael Roberts at Trumps). John Sedlar at St. Estephe 
invented a newly sophisticated, French-inspired Southwest cuisine. Susan 
Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken created a new kind of cooking at City Restaurant 
by giving Third-World food real respect. Puck sealed his celebrity status by 
bringing us California-Asian cooking at Chinois. For a while it seemed that the 
possibilities were endless; celebrity chefs seemed to be opening new 
restaurants every minute, each time featuring some fabulous new food. 
</P>
<P>
In just 10 years we have gone from nouvelle cuisine to California cuisine, from 
Franco-Japanese to cross-cultural cooking. We've explored regional American 
food. We have discovered Thai food and 10 new regions of China. We have grazed 
and we have taken to tapas. We have had so much new food thrown at us that 
everybody's gotten tired of eating experiments. Nowadays nobody wants to hear 
about new cuisines. Nobody wants any new inventions. Our palates are jaded. We 
long for rustic fare, for meat loaf and mashed potatoes. Which is problematic 
for a chef. After all, how famous can you get serving food that any mom can 
make? 
</P>
<P>
Where does that leave the chefs who would be celebrities? Standing in the 
kitchen, staring at the stove. And, for some of them, wondering what they're 
doing there. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the picture of the four young men accompanying this story. They may 
look like members of a '70s-era band called "The Chefs," but the photograph was 
sent out with the press release that announced the opening of Michael's 
Restaurant in Santa Monica 10 years ago. If the chefs look arrogant in the 
photo, you should have heard them talk. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Frank (he's the one on the right, posed like a lead guitarist) was prone to 
announcements like this one: "In 6 months in France you can learn to be a chef 
in L.A." And of course he knew what he was talking about. At the ripe old age 
of 23 he was one of the city's most acclaimed chefs. When asked why he was 
going to work for Michael McCarty instead of opening his own place he said 
airily: "At my age I can afford to wait another year. I can wait for the right 
time and the right place. Backers are no trouble to find." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a journalist told Jonathan Waxman (the tall one in the back who looks 
like the bass player in every British band) that she would make him famous, and 
he smiled and said deprecatingly, "Don't do me any favors." He had every 
intention of being famous, his tone of voice implied, and he wouldn't need 
anybody's help, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
This was clearly a new breed of chef. And they knew it. One afternoon, as Mark 
Peel (standing in the middle where the drummer would be) fileted salmon for a 
terrine, he made the following pronouncement: "All chefs should go to college 
so that they're not dull." As for owner Michael McCarty (the one in the front 
pretending to be Mick Jagger), he said from the start that his restaurant would 
serve food that would "blow your socks off." He was proud of what he was doing, 
and proud of the people he was doing it with. "They're all here for two 
reasons. 1. Because they'd like to work with me, and 2. because I'm not a 
50-year-old Frenchman who owns the restaurant and is mean. We're doing 
something different here, and I'm allowing it to happen." Encouraging it, even. 
He expected his chefs to move on. "They all," he said, "one day will probably 
have their own restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
And of course he was right. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days it would have taken years for a young chef to open his own 
restaurant. But in the days of the celebrity chef, it often took mere hours. 
Ken Frank left Michael's within months to open his own place, La Toque. At the 
time he said, "The day I own my own restaurant I'll start making money." Today 
he says: "Those were famous last words. It was actually the day I stopped 
making money." Frank was to discover that fame and fortune do not necessarily 
go hand in hand; despite his status as a celebrity chef, his La Toque has been 
plagued by financial problems and a few years ago filed for Chapter 11 status. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Waxman waited four years before going off to New York to open, to 
great acclaim, Jams. It was followed, in rapid succession, by Bud's, Hulot's 
and Jams in London. Waxman hopped around the world, cooking and being charming. 
He was quoted everywhere; every time you opened a food magazine, there he was. 
As he said just last week: "I was the big-mouth frog who tried to eat too many 
flies. I tried to do too much. I burned myself out." He recently sold his share 
in all the restaurants but Hulot's and is now finishing his (long overdue) book 
while considering his next move. 
</P>
<P>
Michael McCarty billed himself as chef/proprietor when he opened his 
restaurant. But he never went overboard about being a celebrity chef, and over 
the years he began emphasizing the proprietor part of the equation. "You have 
to understand," he once said, "I'm a wheeler-dealer. It's all a matter of 
juggling time and money." He got out of the kitchen and kept juggling: in the 
air at the moment, a Michael's in New York and a big luxury hotel on Santa 
Monica's beach. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Mark Peel was in no hurry to be famous. First he went to college. 
Then he went from Michael's to Chez Panisse in Berkeley, and then to Spago, 
which he opened with Wolfgang Puck. He was head chef there for four years, 
working quietly in Puck's shadow. Just last month he and his wife Nancy 
Silverton opened Campanile on La Brea. "If you're talking about celebrity," he 
now says, "you're talking to the wrong guy. I don't want to be a celebrity 
chef. It's too much work -- traveling all over, having your picture taken. It's 
insidious. The danger is you stop paying attention to what you're supposed to 
be 
</P>
<P>
doing -- you stop thinking about cooking. And that's why I got into this 
business in the first place. I can't sing, I can't dance, I can't play the 
saxophone. But I really can cook. And that's what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
For a while, cooking is what lots of people wanted to do. The occupation, in 
fact, achieved such cachet that restaurants in New York and Los Angeles 
actually instituted "Chef for a Day" programs; wealthy patrons paid big bucks 
for the privilege of coming into the kitchen and cooking with the chef of their 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile professional cooking schools had long waiting lists. Parents who just 
a few years earlier would have slit their throats had their sons or daughters 
announced that they wanted to go work in a restaurant began speaking proudly of 
"My son the chef." You would have thought that working in a kitchen was a 
glamorous activity. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't. "I always thought working in a kitchen was really fun," says Jonathan 
Waxman. "I still love it. But I'm getting old, and it's a young person's game." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, you should know, is not yet 40. Old for an athlete and old for a cook, 
another profession that requires strength, stamina and the ability to withstand 
pressure, heat and noise. Seen through the glass at Citrus, or in the 
exhibition kitchen at Spago, restaurant cooking looks clean and easy. "Most 
young chefs," says Ken Frank, "don't know how hard the work is. You work 80 
hours a week; if you own your own place, add 25-30 hours. And very few break 
through to the top level. The odds of becoming Wolfgang are very slim." 
</P>
<P>
And becoming slimmer all the time. "It's a lot more expensive to open a 
restaurant today than it was a few years ago," says Jonathan Waxman. "And the 
big cities -- New York, Chicago, L.A., San Francisco -- are saturated. There 
are so many people vying for not that much business." Says Puck: "Maybe in a 
different place it might be different. But in L.A. there are already so many 
well-known chefs." 
</P>
<P>
Put another way, a Los Angeles chef today has to do more than just serve 
interesting food. He or she must have a keen business sense, watch the bottom 
line, and figure out a way to make good food that doesn't cost too much. During 
the height of restaurant madness money hardly seemed to matter. But in today's 
market, price has become the key to survival; faced with so many wonderful 
restaurants, diners are increasingly opting to eat in the ones that offer not 
only good food but good value as well. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to be a star on a tight budget. Which is difficult for some young 
chefs to swallow. They've gone to school, they've learned their craft and they 
know where to buy the finest ingredients; now they think of themselves as 
artists ready to serve their masterpieces to a waiting world. To their dismay 
they are discovering that Americans don't want to eat art; they just want to 
eat dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Frank thinks that the new mood is fine. "Look," he says, "let's be real. 
The level of admiration is quite out of proportion to the work that we do. 
Don't get me wrong. I love my job. But when I read the things that people write 
about chefs . . . the adjectives are too big. Chefs are not rocket scientists." 
</P>
<P>
Even the restaurant junkies seem to be noticing that. Five years ago I wrote an 
article about Foodies who ate all their meals in restaurants. Producer Jay 
Weston was one of them; he told me he had been so busy eating in restaurants 
that he hadn't had time to work in a year or two. Today he says he is as 
enthusiastic about eating as he ever was, but adds, "I'm more cynical about 
restaurants that I visit now. And more critical." 
</P>
<P>
He is not alone. Everybody has become more critical. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get put up on a pedestal," says Ken Frank, "people expect more than 
you can give them. Take me: People were always calling me a wunderkind. I may 
have been precocious, but I wasn't a genius. I just cooked food that people 
liked. Then when the slightest little thing was wrong people would say -- see, 
the butter's too cold -- he's no genius." 
</P>
<P>
Today few chefs are being called geniuses. You don't see that telephone company 
ad featuring Wolfgang and Alice any more either. And when was the last time you 
watched Paul Prudhomme on TV? Still, the chefs got more than 15 minutes of fame 
-- a lot more. Which, by American standards, is substantial. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the current trend can't last forever. Meatloaf, after all, 
has its limitations. So do mashed potatoes. Boredom will set in. And when it 
does, somebody is bound to come along to rescue us from the tyranny of simple 
cooking. In return, we just might make him (or her) a star.

THE CHEFS WHO WOULD BE STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ruth Reichl 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of them were born too late. Some of them were born in the wrong place. And 
some were simply born with the wrong attitude. These are the chefs who should 
have been stars -- and the reasons why they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Richard: By all rights Michel Richard should be a star. His Citrus is 
certainly the most interesting new restaurant to open in Los Angeles in the 
past few years; last year, in fact, Citrus was voted best new restaurant in 
America by a jury of his peers (Who's Who of American Cooking). 
</P>
<P>
Then too, Richard is a wonderful chef whose food is consistently surprising, 
delicious and inventive. What he cooks is uniquely his own, more Californian 
than French, more Richard than Californian. And watching him careen around his 
laboratory kitchen, it is clear that he revels in cooking; you will never see a 
chef who gets more pleasure from the act of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that Richard has enormous personal charm; it is impossible to meet 
the man and not be seduced by the force of his personality. 
</P>
<P>
So why don't you read about Richard in the social pages? Because his timing was 
wrong; Citrus opened a little too late. Had Richard opened a year or two 
earlier, he would surely have been forgiven the fact of being French and been 
made into a major star. As it is, he'll have to settle for being a very rich 
chef. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Healy: Healy has almost everything it takes to be a celebrity chef. He 
is young, American, handsome and bright. Everybody agrees that his food is 
wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when he was the chef at Colette, Healy seemed headed for fame. But by 
the time he opened his own Champagne 2 years ago, it was clear that celebrity 
was not in the stars. 
</P>
<P>
This is partly because Healy does not seem interested in staking out new 
territory; his food is resolutely French or California French. Still, with his 
good food and an innovative menu that blends French, Californian and Spa 
cuisines, Healy probably could have been a contender. 
</P>
<P>
Had he wanted to be. But both Healy and his restaurant have a modest quality 
unbecoming a star. The restaurant, opened without investors, is decidedly not 
splashy. And Healy himself works behind closed doors and is not prone to 
strutting around his dining room. Clearly this is one man who wanted to be a 
chef, not a star. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Schwartz: He turned meat loaf into upscale food when he put it on the 
menu at 72 Market Street. And Schwartz was among the first to identify the 
trend toward real American food. Still, you probably have never heard of him. 
</P>
<P>
For if celebrity chefdom is what he was after, Schwartz made one serious 
mistake: He went to work for a true blue celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
When Tony Bill is out front, who is going to go looking for the chef behind the 
scenes? 
</P>
<P>
Hans Rockenwagner: Rockenwagner, who had the audacity to give his restaurant 
his own unpronounceable last name, would probably like to be famous. And he has 
almost everything it takes -- a great pedigree in food, great looks, great 
food. He even has an attractive wife who works with him -- and a beautiful 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
But, while he has done well enough to open a second restaurant (the new Fama in 
Santa Monica), he's been plagued by bad timing. If Rockenwagner were only a 
little bit older, he would surely have been a star. But he came along after the 
first generation, and as Puck says, "The first wave paved the way for the next 
guys. And they're not as famous. Even in France, it's the same. Maximin is not 
going to have the impact that Verge or Troisgros did." 
</P>
<P>
Joachim Splichal: He is one of our best chefs, and his Patina, due to open 
early next month, is being eagerly awaited by sophisticated eaters. 
</P>
<P>
But after opening the 7th Street Bistro to great acclaim, he decamped, only to 
reappear a bit later at Max au Triangle. The restaurant, a critical success, 
closed in less than two years, and Splichal went on to consulting jobs in New 
York and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Splichal isn't American, and he doesn't cook American food. Still, in the early 
days of celebrity chefs, he probably would have become a star on the sheer 
strength of his cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Peel: With his brand-new Campanile the hottest restaurant in town, Peel 
would be the most likely candidate for next celebrity chef. He is bright, 
young, handsome and articulate. He's just finishing up his cookbook. And, as 
the longtime chef at Spago, he has certainly paid his dues. 
</P>
<P>
But Peel's rustic Italian fare is the soul of simplicity. People are more 
likely to come away saying, "What a delicious dinner," than "I've never tasted 
anything like that before." And that's not how stars are born. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, how are you going to make a star out of someone who says he doesn't 
want to be recognized on the streets? Someone who, when asked by a photographer 
from a national magazine, "Who is your groomer?" replies, "I don't have 
groomers." 
</P>
<P>
Toribio Prado: At 23 Prado is certainly young. And good looking. And he's 
certainly had an impact on the cooking of the city. 
</P>
<P>
His Cha Cha Cha sparked the Caribbean craze that swept through the city. And 
despite an east-side location and low prices, it managed to attract an upscale 
celebrity clientele. But Prado was plagued by a partner who stole the 
spotlight. Mario Tamayo was the life of the party, and Prado seemed like just 
another guy behind the stove. Moral: A chef who wants to be a celebrity has to 
get out of the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Evan Kleiman: When they talk about women in the kitchen, Mary Sue Milliken and 
Susan Feniger of City Restaurant always come first. Evan Kleiman, whose Angeli 
paved the way for the dozens of small authentic Italian cafes that came behind 
it, is always a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
Kleiman is young, American, attractive and bright. She has a couple of 
cookbooks that sell very well, and her two Angelis are so architecturally 
audacious that they are constantly popping up in design magazines. But Italian 
food has not traditionally received a lot of respect in this country, and 
Kleiman's food is more authentic than innovative. Other chefs were serving 
pasta with preposterous toppings; Kleiman was busy teaching us that Italians 
don't like a lot of sauce on their spaghetti. In the '80s that was not a road 
to fame. Ruth Reichl

Spectacular Mediterranean styling centers on the two-story, arched, glass entry 
of this custom home. Its angular garage, bay windows, hand-detailed plaster 
parapets, wood solar shades, tile roof lines and the rooftop deck are blended 
to shape the exterior of this four-bedroom, 3,170-square-foot home. 
</P>
<P>
With the needs of a family that enjoys entertaining in mind, the entire first 
floor has a layout that provides spatial and visual flow. The 
beveled-glass-lighted central entry hall -- with tile floors, curved stairway 
and arched porticoes -- introduces visitors to the multilevel living and dining 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
View Through the Arch 
</P>
<P>
The view through the right arch is of the living room fireplace -- framed by 
the curving staircase above; the formal room has a clear view and access to the 
circular rear garden entertainment patio. 
</P>
<P>
Even a demanding gourmet cook would be at home in this luminous-ceiling, 
island-style kitchen. Special features include a marble slab for making pastry, 
wine rack, separate island sink providing a second work area, a desk and 
bookrack, sliding-glass pass-through window and a pair of venting skylights 
over the double kitchen sinks. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen has direct access to all adjoining rooms, and the hall that leads 
from the garage. The exposed-beam-ceiling family-den, located directly off the 
kitchen, has a dining nook with a garden view and a pair of doors to both 
patios. 
</P>
<P>
The second floor is designed to provide the master suite a maximum of privacy. 
Features include a full walk-in closet and built-in dresser, tiled shower with 
attached spa open to the bedroom, corner fireplace and private patio with log 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
This house was built with a portion of the attic designed as an adult loft, set 
over the master closet and rooftop deck above the flat-roofed entry hall. A 
spacious laundry is set between two closets for better sound control. The 
second and third bedrooms are planned with views and ample storage in mind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plenty of Room for Hobbies 
</P>
<P>
The three-car garage includes two work bench areas, allowing plenty of room for 
family hobbies and direct access to the house for added security and ease of 
unloading groceries. 
</P>
<P>
Large-scale sample floor plan and exterior elevations for Plan 48805 can be 
purchased for $19.95. Fully detailed custom-style working drawings are $98 for 
the first set and $68 for each additional one ordered at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Allow at least four weeks for delivery. A large reproduction rendering of the 
exterior is available for $5.33. An outline specification booklet is $2.13. 
Also available are six home plan books illustrating nearly 1,000 plans for 
$14.85. Add $2 to all plan and book orders for postage and handling. Prices 
include sales tax, if applicable. Send all orders to: Hiawatha Homes, P.O. Box

MAKE IT A POLICY TO GET THE CORRECT INSURANCE; 
</P>
<P>
TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE COVERAGE COULD BE AN EXPENSIVE MISTAKE IN CASE OF LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and real 
estate broker. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
How much would it cost to rebuild your home if it burned to the ground? Is this 
the amount of insurance you carry on your home? If not, why not? 
</P>
<P>
The right amount of insurance. Smart homeowners insure their homes for the full 
cost of replacing their home, excluding the land and foundation value. But 
foolish homeowners either underinsure or overinsure. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't insure for the full replacement cost of your home, in the event of 
a loss, the insurance company may not be obligated to pay the full amount of 
your loss, even if you have only a partial loss. 
</P>
<P>
But many homeowners waste money by overinsuring, usually because the mortgage 
lender asks for an insurance policy for the amount of the mortgage balance. 
This is not the right way to determine the correct amount of insurance, because 
the mortgage balance is irrelevant to the home's replacement cost. Several 
states now have laws prohibiting lenders from requiring such overinsurance 
(California is the latest state to pass such a law). 
</P>
<P>
For example, suppose your mortgage balance is $100,000, but it will cost only 
$80,000 to rebuild your home in the event of a total loss. Obviously, you need 
only $80,000 of fire insurance. 
</P>
<P>
But many mortgage lenders would demand that you waste money and carry $100,000 
of fire insurance. However, many lenders can be convinced such overinsurance is 
a waste of money. Surprisingly, most insurance companies don't want 
policyholders to overinsure, even though the insurer earns extra premiums, 
because overinsurance encourages arson. 
</P>
<P>
How to determine your home's replacement cost. The cheapest way to determine 
your home's replacement cost is to invite one or more insurance agents to 
inspect your home and give their estimate of its replacement cost. 
</P>
<P>
If you purchase a guaranteed replacement cost homeowner's insurance policy, the 
insurer is then obligated to rebuild your home, even if the cost exceeds your 
policy limits. Most lenders now accept these guaranteed replacement cost 
policies even if the amount is lower than the mortgage balance. 
</P>
<P>
How to cut your homeowner's insurance cost. In addition to not overinsuring, 
another way to cut the cost of your home insurance is to raise the amount of 
the deductible. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive policies have $100 and $250 deductibles. If you can afford 
to pay the first $500 of any loss, you can save substantially on your 
homeowner's insurance premium. Better yet, if you can raise the deductible to 
$1,000, you will save even more. 
</P>
<P>
Another way to cut your home insurance cost is to lower the liability limit. 
The liability coverage on your policy protects you in case someone is injured 
on your property, such as a visitor falling down the front steps. At least 
$100,000 liability coverage is essential, but $300,000 to $1 million coverage 
is not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
However, ask your insurance agent if you can save money by lowering your 
homeowner's policy liability limit and purchasing a $1,000,000 or higher 
"umbrella policy" from the same insurance company. Umbrella policies are very 
inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
Still another method of cutting your homeowner's insurance is to compare 
personal property coverage. Some policies pay only the depreciated value of 
furnishings that are damaged or stolen, but other policies pay the full current 
replacement cost. 
</P>
<P>
Most policies insure personal property up to 50% of the replacement-cost policy 
limit for the building. If you are willing to accept personal property 
depreciated-cost coverage rather than replacement cost you can usually save 
substantially. 
</P>
<P>
Choose an insurance agent as much as you choose the company. When buying 
homeowner's insurance policies, ask friends for recommendations of the best 
insurance agents. Although you may be able to purchase cheaper insurance 
elsewhere, if the local insurance agent is known for top quality claims 
service, that is the company to select unless the premium is far above the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ask each agent how claims are handled. If they are settled locally, that is a 
big advantage. However, if claims must be approved in a distant office, perhaps 
a slight premium saving isn't worth the hassle. There is no substitute for a 
local insurance agent who realizes the customer must be satisfied if the agent 
is to prosper. 
</P>
<P>
Don't confuse mortgage insurance with life insurance. Finally, don't be 
confused about all the insurance agents who want to sell you mortgage 
insurance, which will pay your mortgage in case you become disabled or die. 
These policies have no connection with fire and liability coverage. 
</P>
<P>
They are essentially life insurance. If you already have adequate life 
insurance, you probably don't need a mortgage-protection policy. However, since 
these policies are extremely profitable for insurers, don't be surprised if you 
are continually harassed by many agents who want to sell you such insurance.

HOT IMPROVEMENTS VARY CITY TO CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An interesting result of a survey of home improvements conducted by Practical 
Homeowner magazine was the variance in the choice of people in different cities 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, while an interior face lift was rated first in Atlanta, Dallas, 
Cincinnati and Salt Lake City on the basis of how it might improve the value of 
a house, it was far down the list in some other cities. In Seattle, it ranked 
10th on a list of 10 such home improvements. 
</P>
<P>
What ranked first in Seattle? The installation of skylights, not even mentioned 
on other lists. 
</P>
<P>
Exterior painting got the nod in Los Angeles, central air conditioning in 
Philadelphia and a swinging glass patio door in San Francisco.

HOTEL'S HIRING OF OFFICIALS' RELATIVES CHALLENGED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two city residents say they will ask the City Council Tuesday to investigate 
hiring practices at the Compton Lazben Hotel, which is scheduled to open soon. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Walter Tucker's daughter, Camille, is listed on the hotel's personnel 
roster. She said she has been offered a job, but has not formally accepted. The 
wife of a city redevelopment official also was among the employees listed on a 
report submitted to the council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflict of Interest 
</P>
<P>
The hotel management's plan to hire Camille Tucker smacks of nepotism and poses 
a conflict of interest, said the two residents, Benjamin Holifield and Basil 
Kimbrew. Holifield was an unsuccessful candidate in last spring's City Council 
elections. Kimbrew is a political consultant who managed the campaign of 
Tucker's opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrew and Holifield said they want the council to determine whether influence 
at City Hall played a part in the hirings and whether the hiring process was 
open and competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Any council member who personally profits or has a family member "who may 
profit personally at the expense of the people" should not make decisions about 
the hotel, Holifield and Kimbrew said in a written statement distributed at a 
press conference Thursday morning outside the unfinished hotel and convention 
center complex. 
</P>
<P>
According to a list prepared for the City Council by the hotel, Camille Tucker 
is to be a concierge when the hotel opens Aug. 15. Darlinda Nuby, wife of 
Michael Nuby, deputy director of the city's Redevelopment Agency, is already 
working as an administrative assistant in the hotel's personnel department. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's daughter said Thursday: "I have been extended an offer but I have 
never formally accepted that offer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daughter Working Elsewhere 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that she applied for the job, but said she has not signed any 
documents, such as federal wage and tax forms, that would indicate she has 
accepted the hotel's offer. She said she is working "at a small luxury hotel," 
which she declined to name, in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tucker said: "If the hotel did hire any relatives of mine, I had nothing 
to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Nuby said he had nothing either "directly or indirectly" to do with his wife's 
hiring. He also said that his wife has considerable work experience that 
qualifies her for a job at the hotel, though he declined to elaborate. Darlinda 
Nuby, reached at the hotel, declined to comment, as did Jona M. Liebrecht, 
president of Lazben Hotel Management Co. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel and convention center, a joint venture between the city and a private 
developer, is next to the 91 Freeway at Alameda Street. The developer, Naftali 
Deutsch of Beverly Hills, has received loans and other financial subsidies from 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the hotel was to open in May, 1988, but construction delays and 
money disagreements between the city and developer pushed the opening back to 
next month. Deutsch and his family control the Lazben Hotel Management Co. and 
several construction and development firms involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
The delays and city loans to the developer made the hotel project, along with 
the city's entire redevelopment plans, a lightning rod for criticism, which 
became intense this spring when the mayor and two council members ran for 
reelection. Only the mayor survived the election contest. The councilmen, 
Robert Adams and Floyd James, were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrew managed the campaign of first-term Councilwoman Patricia Moore, who 
defeated James. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's personnel decisions came to light last week when the hotel 
management submitted a list of employees to the City Council. The developer had 
promised that Compton residents would be hired for a majority of hotel jobs, 
and Councilman Maxcy Filer had asked for a status report. 
</P>
<P>
Holifield and Kimbrew mentioned Nuby in their verbal comments during the press 
conference but their written statement about nepotism was aimed solely at the 
mayor. They could offer no evidence, however, that Tucker had anything to do 
with his daughter being offered a job at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
For too long, the Holifield-Kimbrew statement said, Compton has "been 
vulnerable to accusations of public officials profiting from their positions as 
public servants." The two men complained that nepotism is widespread in city 
government and pointed out that the mayor's daughter-in-law, Robin Tucker, 
works in the city manager's office. However, Robin Tucker worked for the city 
before she married the mayor's son, Walter Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Holifield and Kimbrew also complained that William James, the brother of former 
Councilman James, got a job as the city's contract compliance officer while 
James was in office.

LATINO PANEL OFFERS IDEAS TO BRIDGE BILINGUAL GAP 
</P>

<P>
Lynne Gadbury helps decide whether students with limited English skills also 
have learning disabilities that would qualify them for special education 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
In the last school year, she says, she rejected almost half of the students 
that teachers recommended for special education, and sent them back to regular 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers said the children were not creative and were having trouble expressing 
themselves, according to Gadbury. But she says the children, rather than being 
slow learners with disabilities, simply could not speak English. And most of 
their teachers could not communicate in the students' native language. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Problem 
</P>
<P>
The inability of students and teachers to communicate is a growing problem in 
the Long Beach Unified School District, officials acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
One of every four students in the district, including half of the Latino 
students, cannot speak English proficiently. But there are so few bilingual 
teachers that some special classes for non-English-speaking students are being 
taught by teachers who speak nothing but English, school officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the shortage of bilingual teachers, and Latino students' low test 
scores and high dropout rate, a Hispanic Advisory Committee has submitted to 
the Board of Education a series of proposals, including a recommendation that 
all teachers and administrators at some schools be required to learn a second 
language. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Pay Urged 
</P>
<P>
The five-member committee also recommended that the board: 
</P>
<P>
* Pay bilingual teachers a higher salary. 
</P>
<P>
* Agree to "an immediate" increase of 10% to 20% in the number of minority and 
bilingual employees. 
</P>
<P>
* Encourage bilingual teacher aides to attain teacher credentials. The 
committee's report did not offer a specific plan, but committee members said an 
internship program would be one possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the lack of bilingual teachers, many students not fluent in English 
often end up in regular classes, where they are "left to fend for themselves 
and sink or swim," said committee member Jerome Torres. "That's why our kids 
are doing so badly in the system." 
</P>
<P>
Latino high school seniors in the district recorded below-average test scores 
last spring in the California Assessment Program. While the overall average for 
12th-graders was 218 in reading and 234 in mathematics, Latinos averaged 198 in 
reading and 206 in math, according to district statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"The system is failing in meeting the needs of these children. The district is 
monolingual and monocultural," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
Latino children face a bleak future unless the public school system can offer 
role models and teachers who can communicate with students, committee members 
and other Latino leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
"What do we want for our future?" Edna Molina-Tobias, president of the Assn. of 
Hispanic Educators in Long Beach, said in an interview. "Do we want them to be 
busboys and grape pickers? Is that what we are destined to be?" 
</P>
<P>
Overall, school board members appeared receptive to the report, which board 
member Jenny Oropeza called "excellent." 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it's probably the most critical education issue we face in the Long 
Beach Unified School District," Oropeza said recently. "How are we going to 
teach these children who don't speak English? It's our responsibility. And I 
don't think we're doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Bobbie Smith said: "We know we have not done well in terms of 
reaching Hispanics and other limited-English speaking populations. But the 
district is working hard to recruit bilingual instructors and minorities." 
</P>
<P>
A big part of the problem, district officials said, is the dearth of available 
minority and bilingual teachers. For example, while 29% of the district's 
students are Latino, only 4% of about 3,000 teachers are Latino, according to 
district statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say they are trying to hire more Latinos and Asians, but few are 
applying. Supt. E. Tom Giugni said that of 382 applications received in recent 
months, 17 were from Latinos, for example. Of the 200 teachers hired last year, 
20 were Latino, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Accepted Practice 
</P>
<P>
The shortage of bilingual teachers has prompted district officials to hire some 
new teachers on the condition that they will learn a second language within 
three years, said Felice Strauss, president of the Teachers Assn. of Long 
Beach. The practice is accepted by the state and done in other districts, said 
Mike Garcia, program administrator for Language Development Services. 
</P>
<P>
But there is little follow-up to ensure that the teachers do indeed learn a 
second language. "Unfortunately," Garcia said, "we don't have the staff to 
follow on it as much as we would like." 
</P>
<P>
Committee members cited the district's difficulty in recruiting bilingual 
teachers in urging the school board to make internal changes, such as requiring 
teachers, administrators and other support staff to learn a second language if 
at least 30% of the students in their school can't speak English. 
</P>
<P>
If that requirement had been in effect in the last school year, teachers and 
administrators in 19 schools would have been affected, according to Roberto 
Uranga, the Hispanic committee's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Molina-Tobias, who teaches English language development at Benjamin Franklin 
Junior High School, said such a requirement would be "revolutionary, but we 
have to do something. 
</P>
<P>
"We are professionals. We have to keep up with the times. If that means taking 
courses in another language, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disagreement Expressed 
</P>
<P>
Board member Smith said the mandatory language requirement is "something we 
should take a look at. It's an interesting idea. . . . The average rational 
person knows that children have better self-esteem and tend to achieve better 
when they have role models or people who can speak their own language." 
</P>
<P>
Other board members and school officials disagreed with the proposed language 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Myrna Fujimoto, principal at Thomas Jefferson Junior High and one of the 
district's first bilingual teachers in the 1970s, said that a second-language 
requirement would be difficult to enforce. She suggested, instead, that 
teachers receive special training in how to deal with students who do not speak 
English properly. 
</P>
<P>
Gadbury, who speaks Spanish and has been screening students for the special 
education program since September, said she also favors special training. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Jerry Shultz praised the report, but expressed reservations about 
requiring teachers to learn a second language. He said he favors the concept of 
a pay differential for bilingual teachers and a program to encourage bilingual 
aides to become teachers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerns Not Named 
</P>
<P>
School board President Harriet Williams said the board probably would not 
approve a second-language requirement for at least a few years. Even then, it 
would probably apply only to new teachers. Supt. Giugni and Strauss, of the 
teachers' union, both said they have "some concerns" with a language 
requirement, but they declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and Strauss also expressed concern about the recommendation to offer 
differential pay to bilingual staff members. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm not for it," Williams said. "So many of our teachers give 
extra." It would be unfair, she said, to pay some more than others. "I get the 
feeling from staff and teachers that it would be very divisive." 
</P>
<P>
Strauss said that the best solution would be to make teaching a more lucrative 
profession in general. Bilingual people, she said, too often are lured away by 
companies offering jobs with higher salaries and more prestige than teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot needs to be done to improve the status of teachers," Strauss said. "We 
need to make teaching a profession people want to get into" by increasing all 
teachers' salaries and reducing class sizes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff to Review It 
</P>
<P>
Giugni said the district's staff will review the report before individual 
suggestions are forwarded back to the school board for further consideration. 
</P>
<P>
During the June 12 board meeting, Williams told the committee: "This is a good 
report. It will not be put on the shelf." 
</P>
<P>
But board members set no deadline for when they will consider implementing the 
suggestions, and said it may take years before some of the changes might be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said that the committee will be "monitoring very closely" whether the 
school district acts on the report. "We're not going to let this issue die," he 
said. "The bottom line is that the Latino community is here to stay. And the 
school district has to deal with that." 
</P>
<P>
The committee was formed about three years ago by representatives of various 
Latino, educational and church organizations. At the time, committee members 
told the school board they would like to prepare a report, and Giugni gave his 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
WHERE THE TEACHERS ARE NEEDED 
</P>
<P>
The greatest need in Long Beach schools is for teachers who speak Spanish and 
Cambodian.

RESIDENTS FEAR FOR SAFETY OF FUEL TANKS IN NORWALK

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Stock says he has been fearful ever since the U.S. Department of Defense 
began storing jet fuel in the huge tanks near his Seaforth Street home more 
than 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Stock says he is more concerned than ever after the recent release of a 
seismic safety study that identifies weaknesses and indicates that a strong 
earthquake could cause the tanks to leak, electrical connections to spark and 
possibly trigger an explosion. He has petitioned local and federal officials 
for three decades to close the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The depot was privately built in the 1920s on the southeast corner of Norwalk 
Boulevard and Excelsior Drive. The U.S. Air Force acquired the depot in 1951, 
and soon the site was surrounded by homes and heavily used Holifield Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
775,000-Million Barrel Capacity 
</P>
<P>
The facility has 12 fuel storage tanks with a total capacity of 775,000 million 
barrels. It also has several buildings, including administration, a laboratory 
and two pump station buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm damned worried," Stock, 62, said in an interview last week. "If it 
explodes, we're gone. If they have a fire, I don't think there's any way they'd 
put it out." 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials agree with Stock. 
</P>
<P>
"That tank farm is not safe to a certain extent," Mayor Grace Napolitano said 
in an interview. "They say they can correct the deficiencies. I really want it 
out of there." 
</P>
<P>
But a military spokesman defended the safety of the operation and said the 
Department of Defense will make $1.7 million in improvements suggested by the 
study, which was completed last month. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Pharris D. Johnson, commander of the Defense Department's seven-state 
Defense Fuel Region West, said the tank farm is strategically located and 
should not be moved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Intend to Improve It' 
</P>
<P>
"Overall the report said the tanks were expected to survive," Johnson said. 
"Although we feel the terminal overall meets or exceeds the industry standards 
and compares favorably with any like facilities in Southern California and the 
country, we intend to improve it even further where possible." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he did not know when the work would be completed. 
</P>
<P>
The tank farm is a key link in the military's fuel supply system. It supplies 
bases in California, Nevada and Arizona through a series of government and 
private pipelines, and by truck as well, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The seismic safety study by Libby Engineers of San Diego identified 
deficiencies that could prove potentially dangerous in a strong earthquake. The 
study found: 
</P>
<P>
Some leakage of jet fuel may occur at riveted joints of the large steel tanks, 
which also may buckle. But the study concluded: "It is believed the fuel tanks 
would sustain damage but not collapse." 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake may break pipes loose from the tanks, resulting in fuel spills. 
If there were leakage, asphalt-covered dikes around the tanks are expected to 
contain the fuel, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
A large movement of the tanks or other equipment in an earthquake could break 
electrical connections that are too short or too rigid and cause arcing. Also, 
explosion-proof electrical components that will not ignite vapors were not used 
in four instances where they should have been, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
A great quake probably would seriously damage administration and laboratory 
buildings or cause them to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Libby Engineers proposed $1.7 million in improvements to make the facility 
safer in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The seismic study was requested by U.S. Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente), 
who has met with Stock and other concerned citizens. Torres said he plans to 
hold a meeting next month with city officials and residents to discuss the 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
"The work has to be done immediately," Torres said in an interview. "If the big 
one comes, I'm sure fires could erupt." 
</P>
<P>
But Torres said he does not support moving the tank farm, given its strategic 
importance and the cost involved. He said he has seen no evidence that it poses 
a "clear and present danger" to the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tainted Soil Found 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in recent months that questions were raised about the 
safety of the tank farm. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 study by another consultant discovered about 3,800 cubic yards of soil 
contaminated with heavy fuel oil. Benzene, a cancer-causing agent, was 
detected. Lead was detected 27 feet below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Buried waste oil was discovered in 1985 at two areas in the southeast section 
of the tank farm when workers were digging to install a storm drain. The report 
also said two spills of unknown amounts of jet fuel occurred in 1968 and 1969. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said relatively high levels of benzene and another solvent were 
detected in water samples from test wells at relatively shallow depths. 
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that the ground-water contamination discovered is not a 
threat to the public, because it was detected well above the aquifer from which 
usable water is drawn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concrete Layer Proposed 
</P>
<P>
But the study recommends that a concrete cap be placed over the contaminated 
soil to prevent rainwater from percolating through to deeper ground water. 
Capping the contaminated soil is expected to cost $340,000. The Department of 
Defense will begin further study of soil and ground water contamination later 
this month, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Reports on the soil study were presented to state and county health departments 
and the Regional Water Quality Control Board as required by law, Johnson said. 
But city officials apparently were not notified. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he did not know why they were not informed of the results. "I know 
that by law the people who should have been notified were notified," Johnson 
said. "We're not talking about some real serious life-threatening problem here. 
We're talking about something we can deal with." 
</P>
<P>
But the apparent oversight has left some city officials and residents wondering 
whether tank farm officials are being forthright. City officials said they 
found out about the study last May. 
</P>

Block Wall Installed 
</P>
<P>
Johnson points to recent efforts to satisfy Norwalk residents, including the 
proposed installation of a block wall along Norwalk Boulevard and Excelsior 
Drive to better shield the facility from vandalism. The tank farm is surrounded 
by a chain-link fence that is topped with barbed wire. Johnson said the 
facility has suffered only minor incidents of vandalism, such as rock throwing. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be good citizens," Johnson said. "We feel we owe it to the citizens 
of Norwalk to maintain it in first-class condition and we intend to do 
everything in our power to do that." 
</P>
<P>
But for some residents, such as Stock, the Department of Defense will never be 
able to make the tank farm safe. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just throwing money away," Stock said. "There's no way they can make 
that facility safe when it's surrounded by residents."

'BOOM CARS' AROUSE AGONY AND ECSTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two sleek mini-trucks cruised slowly through the beach parking lot, proclaiming 
their presence with a steady beat of high-powered booms that rolled from the 
pickups to the sea, out-rumbling the surf. 
</P>
<P>
On this blue, lazy beach day in Long Beach, Jesse Gonzalez and Eddie Lopez were 
out "booming" in their mini-trucks, playing the usual bass-heavy rap and soul 
music to shake up their cabs a bit -- let the Cherry Avenue beach crowd know 
they were around. 
</P>
<P>
In the ever-evolving world of car crazes, "boom cars" packed with elaborate, 
expensive and achingly loud stereo systems have become a nationally accepted 
badge of status for the young and the male, as well as an earsplitting 
annoyance to anyone within their expansive range. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that's going on right now," Lopez said, explaining, with 
simplicity if not insight, why he has spent nearly $5,000 on sound equipment 
and collected $1,200 in tickets for playing it too loudly. "When hot rodding 
was in, why did you want to speed?" 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, a hefty 21-year-old trash collector from Long Beach, cruises in a black 
Chevrolet mini-truck that seems propelled not by the forces of internal 
combustion, but by waves of sound that vibrate his cab seat with a nervous 
jiggle. On his truck's hood is a spray-painted mural of a figure of death 
carrying a limp woman. 
</P>
<P>
"She died of sound, too much sound," quipped a friend. 
</P>
<P>
It is too much for many communities that liken boomers' sonic stakeouts to a 
recurring migraine headache. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Long Beach, southeast Los Angeles County cities and Los Angeles 
have been trying to dull the thump of boom cars with ticket-writing crackdowns 
and in some cases, anti-noise ordinances. A state senator from Norwalk has even 
introduced a bill, passed by the Senate and now before the Assembly, that would 
make it a violation of the state Vehicle Code to play a vehicle's sound system 
so loudly that it can be heard at a distance of 25 feet or more. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to sit at signals next to some of the deaf turkeys that own boom 
boxes and my whole body vibrated. They are a nuisance as well as a hazard," an 
angry Lakewood man wrote to Sen. Cecil Green (D-Norwalk), who introduced the 
anti-boom bill at the behest of city council members from boom-plagued 
Southeast cities. 
</P>
<P>
Even the hard of hearing are not immune. "I have been boomed until my bad ear 
had pain," an elderly Bellflower man wrote Bellflower City Councilman Randy 
Bomgaars, who has been crusading for quieter streets. "We're a society that's 
responding more and more to noise and chaos," Bomgaars complained. "We need to 
return to peace and tranquility." 
</P>
<P>
Audiologists warn that the thunderous volumes of boom systems damage the 
hearing of boom buffs, and local officials worry that boom car drivers, 
oblivious to emergency sirens, will careen into police cars and ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
Stories are legion of the decibel muscle of sophisticated car-music systems, 
which can take up the entire flatbed of a mini-truck. Speakers often number in 
the double digits in a single system, which typically costs from $2,000 to 
$15,000 but can range as high as $80,000. The sound can explode car windows, 
bulge doors and set speakers on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Police Lt. Ken Schack recalls one young man who pushed up the volume 
until he could flip a coin into the air. "Kaboommm, the quarter bounced up off 
the roof," said Schack, who has heard boom cars approach with their 
intimidating thumps from as far as four blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a youth," Schack continued with a hint of nostalgia, "all the cars 
had been lowered in the back. Now we have stereo systems that nobody can get in 
the car and listen to because they die of traumatic injury." 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly, but the roar of super-loud systems does take its toll on ears. "No 
rational person would say these are safe levels," said Maurice H. Miller, chief 
of audiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equal to Airplane Engine 
</P>
<P>
Dale Lincoln, co-owner of Car Radio Sound Center Inc. in Long Beach, says the 
average system he installs can attain volume levels of about 125 decibels, or 
about the same as an airplane engine. Workers exposed to that much noise in a 
factory would have to wear hearing protection. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez is not worried. "I haven't lost none of my hearing," said Lopez, whose 
3-year-old son, a budding boomer, likes to go cruising, even though he can 
barely see out the truck window. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez so far has spent about $1,800 outfitting his second mini-truck with a 
boom system. His first truck, in which he had installed $3,000 worth of sound 
equipment, "got taken away from me at gunpoint" by two men who rode off with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The tickets Lopez and his buddies collect are seen as a relatively minor 
hindrance to the rites of booming. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't worry about them because all you do is pay," said Juan Chavez, a 
21-year-old forklift operator whose black net pullover and black pants matched 
his black Mazda mini-truck. He has been ticketed in Downey, Compton, Signal 
Hill and Long Beach. The noise citations average about $90 apiece but are not 
moving violations and do not go on a driver's record . 
</P>
<P>
Not that boomers want to get ticketed or think they deserve it. 
</P>
<P>
"This ain't no crime. We're not hurting nobody," argues Gonzalez, a bell 
captain at a Long Beach hotel who cranks up the 700-watt system that consumes 
half the bed of his mini-truck when the situation warrants it, such as, "Girls, 
other cars, competition. Whenever you want to show off." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez has what he calls "a police button" on his system. "It lowers the volume 
just like that." At his shop, Lincoln has even installed hidden switches on the 
floors of boom cars, enabling drivers to instantly silence their speakers 
without taking their hands off the wheel when a policeman rolls into view. 
</P>
<P>
But even boomers can grow weary of riding around with an insistent blare in 
their ears. "Sometimes I don't put it in for two days or a week. I get tired of 
it," admitted 21-year-old Lalo Ponce, who has a pullout tape deck in his Nissan 
mini-truck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Has Declined 
</P>
<P>
While national sales of boom systems continue to soar about three years after 
the boom mania took hold, Lincoln says his boom system business has markedly 
declined during the past couple of years, from about 40% of his sales to 20%. 
He attributes the slump partly to police ticketing and partly to a police 
crackdown on cocaine sales, which he suspects have financed a lot of the boom 
systems he has installed. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Wilson, owner of American Car Stereo &amp; Security in Bellflower and Long 
Beach, also points to ticketing as the reason his boom car installations have 
fallen off within the past year. "It's costing me about $10,000 a month in 
sales," Wilson grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite increased police attention, the number of anti-boom tickets issued 
in the Long Beach-Southeast area is relatively moderate. Sgt. Don Reeves of the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said that since the beginning of the 
year, 96 citations have been issued to boomers in the six Southeast cities 
policed by his department: Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Hawaiian Gardens, 
Paramount and Lakewood. Long Beach traffic police estimate they write 6 to 10 
boom tickets a week. 
</P>
<P>
The citations are issued under the same section of the state Vehicle Code that 
Sen. Green is proposing to amend. Currently the code prohibits operation of a 
"radio system intended to make sound audible outside the vehicle when the 
vehicle is being operated upon a highway," wording that some local authorities 
say is too vague to clearly apply to boom systems. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is enact statewide guidelines that will allow local 
authorities to enforce the law," said Renay Montane, a legislative assistant in 
Green's office. The proposal would not, however, make the noise citations a 
moving violation. The penalty would continue to be a fine. 
</P>
<P>
Cities, meanwhile, have taken action on their own. Los Angeles in 1986 added a 
section to the city code prohibiting anyone from playing a car music system 
that can be heard for more than 200 feet in a residential area. The Huntington 
Park City Council recently passed an ordinance making it illegal to operate a 
car sound system "plainly audible" at a distance of 25 feet from the vehicle. 
Bellflower last spring adopted an ordinance that limits noise from a boom car 
parked on private property. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a universal complaint. It's just like graffiti. People are sick of it," 
Artesia City Councilman James Van Horn said.

WEST BACKS REFORMS IN EAST BLOC;

<P>
SUMMIT PLEDGES JOINT ACTION ON POLAND, HUNGARY 
</P>

PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush and the other leaders at the annual summit meeting of seven 
major industrial democracies agreed Saturday to take concerted action in 
support of economic reforms that have been launched in Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
But apart from promising to funnel surplus food to Poland through the European 
Community, the summit leaders did not pledge any specific sum of financial aid 
to the two East European countries. Instead, they said officials of nations 
interested in supporting Poland and Hungary would hold a meeting within the 
next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting on the 35th floor of the stark, angular Arche de la Defense, an 
arch-shaped office building in a Paris suburb, the leaders declared: "We 
welcome the process of reform under way in Poland and Hungary. We recognize 
that the political changes taking place in these countries will be difficult to 
sustain without economic progress." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unexpected Proposal 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose economic and 
political reforms in the Soviet Union have made possible the changes in Poland 
and Hungary, sent a letter to the leaders meeting in Paris in which he urged 
closer economic relations between the Soviet Union and the summit nations. 
</P>
<P>
The summit leaders, in addition to their pledge of support for Poland and 
Hungary, took a variety of actions in the first of two working days in the 15th 
annual economic summit. They: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Issued a brief declaration condemning political repression in China and 
agreeing that the World Bank should postpone new loans to that country. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spent an unusual amount of time discussing international environmental 
issues but came to few agreements on specific measures that the summit nations 
should take. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Planned measures to combat international drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Harmonious' Summit 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who attended the previous eight summits 
as an official of the Ronald Reagan Administration, described the 1989 edition 
as "the most harmonious" of all. 
</P>
<P>
So harmonious was it that the summit leaders decided to end their summit today 
after lunch, canceling a dinner that French President Francois Mitterrand had 
planned for them at the Elysee Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who came directly here from a four-day visit to Poland and Hungary, urged 
the other summit leaders -- from France, Britain, Italy, West Germany, Canada 
and Japan -- to endorse the concerted approach to aiding the two countries' 
reform movements. 
</P>
<P>
During his East European visit, Bush announced a modest aid package for both 
countries, including aid of $100 million for Poland and $25 million for Hungary 
to help develop private enterprise. He said he would like to see other summit 
nations make similar contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Although the summit nations' "Declaration on East-West Relations" included no 
specific financial aid, Baker told reporters that Bush got what he wanted "in 
the form of a commitment for concerted support" and quick action in 
rescheduling Poland's foreign debt. And some of the summit countries, Baker 
said, "are going to be making specific economic incentives available" to Poland 
and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The summit leaders announced that the representatives of "all interested 
countries" will meet "in the next few weeks" to discuss specific forms of 
support for Poland and Hungary. "We underline, for Poland, the urgent need for 
food in present circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
West German officials said their chancellor, Helmut Kohl, had proposed that 
surplus food from Western countries be channeled to Poland through the Economic 
Community. Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski had asked Mitterrand, as the 
summit's host, for credits to buy food, but the summit nations rejected that 
approach because Poland is already deep in debt to the West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support for Poland Pushed 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Bush was eager to follow up on support for reform in Poland and 
Hungary "as expeditiously" as possible, "and, in fact, had written the heads of 
state prior to coming to the summit requesting that this action be taken." 
</P>
<P>
The East-West declaration also: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Favors early conclusion of negotiations between Poland and the 
International Monetary Fund as part of Poland's debt rescheduling strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Applauds leaders in Eastern Europe who are working with reform movements to 
bring about greater political and economic freedom, but "strongly" condemns 
others who "are still endeavoring to resist this movement by taking repressive 
measures." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Calls upon the Soviet government to "translate its new policies and 
pronouncements into further concrete action at home and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
In a day devoted to foreign policy, the summit nations also turned their 
attention to China. In a written declaration, they "condemned the violent 
repression in China in defiance of human rights" and urged authorities there 
"to cease action against those who have done no more than claim their 
legitimate rights to democracy and liberty." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush's Steps Supported 
</P>
<P>
The steps endorsed at the summit reflect many of those taken by the Bush 
Administration. Many, including suspension of high-level contacts with Chinese 
authorities, have already been taken by the other six nations. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration made a special reference to "the grave concern felt by the 
people of Hong Kong" after the massacre in Beijing last month of pro-democracy 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The question of Hong Kong, now a crown colony of Britain, came up during a 
breakfast meeting between Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
The British have agreed to turn the colony over to China on July 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from that breakfast, held at the American ambassador's residence, and an 
evening meeting at the Louvre, Bush spent most of the day in the meeting room 
at the Arche de la Defense. 
</P>
<P>
On other matters, the summit partners commited themselves "to uphold 
international standards of human rights" and renewed their commitment to make 
"no concessions to terrorists or their sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Dissatisfaction 
</P>
<P>
While the issue of terrorism rarely divides the seven summit nations, the 
United States has been dissatisfied with what it views as West Germany's less 
than ardent law enforcement measures against terrorists and France's 
inclination to swap terrorists for French hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration on terrorism also said that the summit nations agreed to give 
priority to preventing such attacks as the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over 
Scotland last December, an act that caused 270 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The summit members devoted more time than in the past to environmental issues, 
which William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, 
said are "beginning to move from the margins to the mainstream of concern." 
Reilly credited Bush for this, but growing environmental concerns have become 
increasingly important politically in the six other summit nations. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly, the first EPA administrator to travel to an international economic 
summit conference, said there is an emerging consensus that "these issues are 
significant, are important, are worthy of concern at the very highest levels of 
government." 
</P>
<P>
However, the summit leaders, in the final communique they issue today, appeared 
unlikely to recommend specific action regarding such international 
environmental issues as deforestation, oceanic oil spills and 
chlorofluorocarbon emissions. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney hoped 
merely to gain support for an international summit conference on environmental 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Environment 
</P>
<P>
A Canadian official said the summit leaders focused on the environment during 
their one-hour evening session at the I. M. Pei-designed pyramid that serves as 
the new entrance to the Louvre. "It's clear that the world is moving to some 
kind of a law of the atmosphere," the official said, suggesting as a precedent 
the international maritime laws. 
</P>
<P>
American environmentalists who converged on Paris declared themselves 
unimpressed by the summit. "Rhetoric is terrific, discussions are great, but we 
feel it's time for specific commitments," said Rafe Pomerance of the World 
Resources Institute. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the international narcotics trade, which Canadian Finance 
Minister Michael H. Wilson called "an important part of the summit," the 
leaders made plans for a study and a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The study, an American initiative, will be of the laundering of drug money to 
obscure its source. "There is a common thread that goes through drugs, and 
that's money," said a senior Administration official who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, sought by Thatcher, will examine ways the industrial nations can 
cut down on demand for drugs. It will be held next summer in Britain.

INFORMANT SWITCHES TO THE DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
JAIL-WISE 'EXPERT' KNOWS WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT LYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, Times Legal Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jailhouse informant Leslie Vernon White, an admitted drug abuser and small-time 
criminal who for years bought his freedom by testifying for prosecutors, has 
now become an expert witness for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike an ordinary witness who has to stick to what he has seen or heard, an 
expert is allowed to give opinions in his field. Usually, the field is a lofty 
one, such as science or medicine. 
</P>
<P>
But White's area of expertise is the behavior of jailhouse informants. And his 
expert opinion is that most of them lie. 
</P>
<P>
"I base that on 12 years experience of watching them lie," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Tall, lean, with bad teeth and a half-dozen prison tattoos, including a 
swastika, White is far from the typical suited expert with a professorial air. 
</P>
<P>
Because he is in custody on a purse-snatching conviction, he testifies in jail 
clothes. And, because law enforcement officials are no longer among his 
friends, he is sometimes forced to wear chains -- something he said never 
happened while he was testifying for prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Why White switched sides is a mystery. Some who know him theorize that he had 
exhausted his usefulness to the prosecution. Others suggest he just got fed up 
with lying. White says he quit for love. He wanted to show his ex-wife that he 
could be a better person. 
</P>
<P>
Since March, judges at three murder trials in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and 
Solano counties have allowed him to testify as an expert. White has been paid 
for each appearance -- as is customary for an expert -- once by the court and 
twice by the defense. He received an average of $500 a case. 
</P>
<P>
In each instance, White testified that the prosecution's informants could have 
made up their stories. Although his performance earned good reviews from 
defense attorneys, its effect on juries was unclear. One case ended in a 
conviction, another in an acquittal and a third in a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
White's most impressive claim to expertise remains the convincing demonstration 
he gave last fall showing that confessions can be faked. Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies supplied him with the name of an inmate who was a suspect in 
a murder case. White then posed as a law enforcement official and, using a jail 
telephone, got other officials to divulge details of the case. Continuing his 
pose, White created a record that he and the suspect had shared a cell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decade of Experience 
</P>
<P>
White's credentials as an expert include a decade of experience. In that time, 
he claims he provided information to police in an estimated 150 cases and lied 
in three-quarters of them. 
</P>
<P>
He says he testified as an informant in 16 cases and lied under oath in three 
of them. This is a dangerous admission, because White could be prosecuted for 
perjury. But he believes he is safe in the three cases because the statute of 
limitations or other developments bar prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
He won't say whether he lied under oath in the other 13 cases, unless 
authorities formally grant him immunity. White says he wants to tell the truth, 
but without immunity prosecutors would "bury me." 
</P>
<P>
"Hypothetically," he said in an interview, "I think I've told the truth in two 
cases." 
</P>
<P>
White says he feels no remorse for framing other inmates. That, he says, is 
because he has no conscience. 
</P>
<P>
"Does it bother you . . . about having committed perjury and having sent people 
to jail?" he once was asked in court. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a bit," White replied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Source of Concern 
</P>
<P>
Still, White claims to be troubled by the behavior of some prosecutors and 
police. He says they knew for more than 10 years that he was a liar, but relied 
on him anyway to testify that other inmates had confessed. White's allegations 
of law enforcement misconduct are part of an ongoing probe by the Los Angeles 
County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
In his expert testimony, the veteran informant said law enforcement officials 
knew for certain in two instances that he intended to lie under oath, but did 
not try to stop him. In other cases, he said, police fed him details of crimes, 
then sat back and waited for him to come forward and claim a suspect had 
confessed those details to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had . . . law enforcement officers come down to the jail, put their foot 
up on the desk and tell me the complete details of a homicide from A to Z, 
including what the suspect drove and the fact of what color his car phone was, 
without stating a reason," White testified. 
</P>
<P>
In such instances, White said, the police did not have to tell him to fake 
confessions. They simply knew he would. 
</P>
<P>
Giving him inside information, White once told the court, was "like taking a 
car and putting the car on the hill and taking the emergency brake off. It's 
going to go down. There's no stopping it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serving a Sentence 
</P>
<P>
White, 31, is serving a nearly six-year prison sentence for purse snatching and 
failure to appear in court -- an extraordinarily severe penalty imposed after 
his demonstration triggered an ongoing review of Los Angeles County murder 
cases involving informants. 
</P>
<P>
His expert testimony includes some of the strategies he says he used so 
successfully over the years. 
</P>
<P>
White testified, for instance, how he would try to figure out what information 
detectives wanted and then would supply it. 
</P>
<P>
"You just simply sell them what they want and they buy all the time," he 
explained. In most cases where informants are used, he said, detectives "are 
desperate for testimony or information to corroborate their theory of the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Even in some cases where police already had an informant, White said there are 
ways to become involved. One sure way, he has testified, is to claim to have 
information that a defendant was trying to arrange to have a prosecutor or 
detective killed. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he had nothing to offer, White said, he would still try to call 
homicide detectives whenever he landed in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're coming down (from drugs after an arrest), you're extremely hungry 
and they don't like you to smoke in the cell," he testified, "so I make a call 
to homicide and get candy and cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Fails to Work 
</P>
<P>
"They always good for that?" asked a defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Always," White replied. 
</P>
<P>
While White portrayed some law enforcement officials as cynical and 
manipulative, he said others are honest and on the lookout for phony 
confessions. Accordingly, he said, a confession shouldn't be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Even if all sorts of details are available from the coroner's office -- an easy 
place to obtain information such as where and how many times a victim was shot, 
White says -- it is best to leave out some of them. 
</P>
<P>
In his expert testimony and in a series of interviews, White also provided 
information to support his claim that Los Angeles authorities had known for 
years that he lied. 
</P>
<P>
A generally nonviolent drug abuser, White first was committed to the California 
Youth Authority at the age of 8 for being "incorrigible." He said he began his 
career as an informant as a 19-year-old in 1977. He said Los Angeles police 
detectives quickly discovered how resourceful and unreliable he was. 
</P>
<P>
In jail for a series of robberies, White said he became a suspect in a murder. 
Although White said he knew nothing about the murder, he decided to string 
police along because they offered him a trip to the California Youth Authority, 
instead of adult prison, if he informed on other suspects in the case. 
</P>
<P>
White said he persuaded police that he was at the house where the murder took 
place by describing it in detail. An investigator he had hired to help prepare 
his defense in the robbery case provided him with the description by taking 
photographs of the house. White said he eventually ended his ruse by showing 
police the photographs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proves Unreliable 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles sheriff's homicide detectives apparently learned of his 
unreliability the following year. In that instance, White said he involved 
himself in an outrageous plot with one of his foster fathers, who was also a 
criminal. 
</P>
<P>
White falsely accused the foster father of kidnaping and killing a 2-year-old 
Ventura girl. He told authorities his foster father confessed to him over the 
phone. But White said he needed to be released from jail so that he could speak 
with his foster father in person to obtain more details. The foster father, who 
was to be paid for his role, instead alerted Los Angeles sheriff's homicide 
detectives, White said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Sheriff's Lt. Ernie Rogers, who was assigned to investigate the 
killing, recalled that he found White to be "a complete liar . . . I'm sure I 
told L.A. detectives about it and went on my merry way." 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, in 1980, the Los Angeles district attorney's office was 
formally told that White was unreliable. White, who then was in state prison 
for kidnaping, wrote the district attorney's office, saying he was paid by 
prosecutors and police to lie on the witness stand. "I can prove this and I 
will take polygraph tests and supply names of officials who are involved," 
White wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Referred to State 
</P>
<P>
Because its own staff was being accused of wrongdoing, the district attorney's 
office referred the case to the state attorney general's office. That agency 
investigated, then notified the district attorney's office that "our final 
appraisal was that White . . . lacked credibility." 
</P>
<P>
But, the very next year, the district attorney's office employed White as an 
informant-witness. The district attorney's office had him transferred from 
state prison where he was serving a sentence for kidnaping to the more 
comfortable Long Beach jail. Then a prosecutor helped him obtain a series of 
eight court rulings from the county's chief criminal court judge, each ordering 
that White be freed for as long as a week at a time. 
</P>
<P>
White claims that he ended his relationship with the district attorney's office 
last year because he wanted to change his life. He hoped to win back his 
ex-wife, he said, by proving to her he could go straight. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that he could no longer deal with prosecutors, he reasoned, might give 
him the willpower to stop using drugs and stop committing crimes. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Before his latest jailing earlier this year, White said he spent his last few 
days of freedom getting high. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't accomplish nothing for myself," he said in an interview. "Nothing."

'GREAT MISTRUST' BETWEEN COMPANIES, AQMD CITED IN STATE'S SLOWDOWN OF SOUTHLAND

<TEXT>
<P>
Regional air quality officials were stunned when the state Air Resources Board 
recently postponed a crucial vote on a far-reaching blueprint for clean air in 
the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
After five years of preparation and controversy, the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District governing board in March attracted worldwide interest when 
it approved the plan, an ambitious proposal that placed tough new air pollution 
controls on everything from cars to patio barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking that they had overcome determined opposition from major business 
interests, AQMD officials believed there was no stopping their effort to rid 
the four-county basin of smog within 20 years. AQMD officials thought the ARB's 
ratification vote was all but assured. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the state board three weeks ago rejected its own staff's 
recommendation and delayed the vote 60 days. ARB chairwoman Jananne Sharpless 
urged the delay, explaining that the long-term success of the clean-air plan 
had been jeopardized by "great mistrust" between the AQMD and business 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
What Sharpless did not mention publicly was that Gov. George Deukmejian, who 
appoints the ARB board, was also "very concerned" about the air quality plan's 
impact on the economy and had discussed those concerns with her only days 
before she called for a postponement. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks before the vote was delayed, the governor and members of his 
cabinet had been heavily lobbied by business interests, including the Los 
Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and the California Manufacturers Assn., which 
had long warned that the plan would be a blow to Southern California's economy 
and could cost thousands of workers their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But the lobbying did not begin or end with the governor. Indeed, business 
interests worked for months in Sacramento to win concessions in the air quality 
plan that they said they were unable to obtain from the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
* During their annual trek to Sacramento last month before the ARB vote, 
members of the chamber had a "substantial" conversation with the governor about 
the plan, chamber President Ray Remy said in an interview. Remy also 
acknowledged that he raised the issue when he joined Deukmejian in Mexico City 
in February to open a new state trade office. 
</P>
<P>
* Officials of the Western States Petroleum Assn., which represents oil 
refineries that would be subject to additional air pollution controls, held a 
series of private meetings in Sacramento with John Geoghegan, secretary of the 
state Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, who is also a member of the 
governor's cabinet. Their objections were later raised at cabinet meetings. 
</P>
<P>
* The California Manufacturers Assn. persuaded Sen. Ralph Dills (D-Gardena) to 
introduce a bill that critics said would have delayed the plan's adoption. The 
measure was introduced just one week before the AQMD was scheduled to approve 
the plan in March. Later, after the AQMD approved the plan, the bill was 
amended to make it take effect immediately instead of in January, in order to 
force the state Air Resources Board this year to take additional time to gather 
information if necessary before approving the plan. 
</P>
<P>
* The CMA also tried to have legislation introduced that would have required 
the Legislature to approve any increases in the AQMD budget beyond an 
established ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
* Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich prevailed on state Sen. William 
Leonard (R-Big Bear) to carry a bill that would have subjected all or parts of 
the plan to repeal or revision by initiative or a referendum vote. 
</P>
<P>
* Antonovich also encouraged a conservative public policy research group known 
as the Claremont Institute to undertake a critical analysis of the air quality 
plan. Although the findings were disputed by the AQMD, Antonovich used them to 
privately lobby some ARB members two days before their decision to postpone the 
vote. The institute is not affiliated with the Claremont colleges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seed Money' Used 
</P>
<P>
The Claremont Institute study was funded in part with $40,000 in "seed money" 
from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Commission, which was created 
by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. The nonprofit organization is 
funded in part by county taxpayers and by 100 corporations. EDC president 
Reginald Bottger said Antonovich suggested the commission contact the Claremont 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
* Business lobbyists prompted state Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) -- whose 
efforts in 1987 gave the AQMD significant new powers -- to call for Senate 
oversight hearings this fall on the district's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Presley also introduced legislation requiring the district to publish each 
year's new preliminary budget in advance of public hearings and preventing the 
district from increasing the final budget more than 10% over preliminary 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
All of the maneuvering demonstrated that business executives remain unconvinced 
they can work with the AQMD. They sought help in Sacramento because they said 
they could not get a fair hearing in El Monte -- a point the AQMD sharply 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
While business interests say they support the need for a clean-air plan in 
principle, they want assurances that the economic costs of proposed rules are 
considered by AQMD along with the potential benefits. The district has 
estimated the plan will cost $2.79 billion a year for the first five years but 
industry estimates are four times higher. 
</P>
<P>
The air quality management plan, which calls for the adoption of more than 120 
separate air pollution controls between now and the year 2007, is divided into 
three tiers. The first tier includes new controls that would be imposed during 
the next five years. These controls are based on available technology. The 
second and third phases become progressively more futuristic and rely on 
technology that is either just around the corner -- including methanol-powered 
cars -- or rely on unforeseen technological breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effect on Transportation 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, for example, the plan calls for 40% of all cars and pickup 
trucks, 70% of all commercial freight trucks and every bus to run on 
alternative cleaner-burning fuels. There would be stepped-up ride-sharing, and 
homes would have to be built closer to employment centers, theoretically to 
reduce commuting. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, manufacturers of consumer products from barbecue lighter fluid to 
underarm deodorants would be asked to reformulate their products so they 
produce fewer smog-producing emissions. Tougher restrictions on emissions from 
major pollution sources such as power plants and oil refineries also are 
envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
All of this has raised questions about the costs of dramatically reducing air 
pollution in the nation's smoggiest air basin where ozone levels are 
occasionally three times higher than federal standards allow. 
</P>
<P>
But despite protests from industry, AQMD Executive Officer James M. Lents 
insists costs have been taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
"Every major rule we've done has literally taken one to three years to develop. 
The biggest part of this debate in all of them is what is the cost and what is 
the air pollution result," he said. "To me the issue is (business doesn't) like 
the decisions. They want the district to make a different decision -- which is 
don't control them as much." 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the mistrust have been verbal exchanges between district 
officials and business representatives. Lents, for example, has likened 
business interests to "tempters" who deal in "misinformation" and called 
environmentalists the "conscience" of the district. 
</P>
<P>
"The district should be doing a better job building stronger ties and 
relationships with the business community and local government, and I don't 
think they've been particularly successful," chamber President Remy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gains Have Been Small 
</P>
<P>
Despite their efforts, the gains made by lobbyists for business and local 
government this year have been slight. Business lobbyists have fallen short of 
their overall goal -- to have major new restraints placed on the district's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Although Deukmejian forwarded the business community's concerns about the 
plan's cost to Sharpless, she said he did not suggest that the vote be delayed. 
That, she said, was her idea. She did so, she explained, to provide time to 
answer two specific questions. 
</P>
<P>
The ARB ordered the AQMD to return in August with a detailed accounting of how 
it would take economic costs into account in adopting new air pollution 
controls. The AQMD also must explain how cities and counties could be counted 
on to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials and environmental groups remain confident that the ARB will 
approve the plan in August without weakening it. Even industry representatives 
concede its approval is likely. 
</P>
<P>
The Dills bill, which would have required the AQMD to prove that its air 
quality plan was enforceable before getting ARB approval, was introduced too 
late to have any impact this year. Leonard was unable to introduce the 
legislation sought by Antonovich to subject the air quality plan to initiatives 
or referendums because he missed the deadline for proposing legislation. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Presley bill that would require the district to observe the same 
public notice requirements on its budget as other governmental agencies 
continues to move forward in the Senate. That bill would also allow the 
district to impose a $3 surcharge on motor vehicle registration fees to help 
fund the district's air pollution programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Politics' 
</P>
<P>
Clean air remains an attractive issue to most Sacramento lawmakers. As EPA 
Administrator William K. Reilly said recently, "Clean air is good politics." 
</P>
<P>
"The consensus for clean air has been holding. I don't think there's any breach 
in the wall," said John White, who lobbies for both the Sierra Club and the 
AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Legislature enacted a California Clean Air Act that goes far 
beyond its federal counterpart and beyond President Bush's proposals for 
strengthening the federal law. Moreover, the state Air Resources Board, which 
is appointed by the governor, recently adopted the most stringent tailpipe 
standards in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Lawmakers are repeatedly asking how a bill would affect our air quality plan. 
They say they're not going to sit here and start to peel off authority to 
prevent the AQMD from doing that," observed Gene Fisher, an AQMD lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
That clean air is "good politics" has not been lost on the business lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, right now a lot of people are concerned about cleaning up the air 
-- and we're among those," said Robert Getts of the petroleum association. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes our task much more difficult, certainly. We say you have to balance 
the health benefits and clean up benefits along with economic and socioeconomic 
costs you incur. It makes it a little more difficult to make some of those 
socioeconomic cases in the environment we have."

PERSISTENT DROUGHT PLAGUES MIDWEST FOR A SECOND YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Drought and drought-related pestilence are threatening large portions of 
America's desiccated heartland, now in its peak growing season but still 
thirsting for relief from the drought of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Areas deficient in rainfall this year never quite recovered from last summer's 
drought," said Ken Kunkel, director of the Midwestern Climate Center at the 
University of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
This year's drought is unlikely to approach either the geographic or economic 
scales of last year's, which was one of the costliest natural disasters in 
American history, driving up food prices and driving down important economic 
indicators. 
</P>
<P>
But the 1989 drought, building on last year's event, will affect tens of 
thousands of farmers and the economies of Midwestern states from Illinois to 
Kansas and from Missouri to North Dakota. Wide areas of the Southwest and West 
are also being affected by drought this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Here in northwestern Minnesota, swarming grasshoppers in numbers that have only 
been recorded in periods of severe drought are attacking fields of wheat, 
barley, sugar beets and oats. Soon they will move to the corn and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 60 years old, have been in this business 30 years and I've never seen them 
like this before," said University of Minnesota entomologist David Noetzel. 
"And the real tough part is still two weeks away for us." 
</P>
<P>
Noetzel has counted as many as 1,100 grasshoppers per square yard of ground, 
140 times what is considered normal. Farmers are routinely reporting 400 to 800 
grasshoppers per square yard, 50 to 100 times normal and the biggest 
infestations since the great Dust Bowl droughts a half-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
Damage from the grasshoppers is already estimated at $20 million, Noetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
In Iowa, traditionally the nation's biggest producer of feed corn, fields are 
dry as the corn plants enter the critical grain producing phase of their life 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
"We are short in topsoil moisture over 93% of the state," Dale M. Cochran, 
Iowa's agriculture secretary, said at week's end. And 99% of the state's fields 
have virtually no subsoil moisture vital to sustain corn plants that normally 
reach a height of eight feet. 
</P>
<P>
In North Dakota, a major producer of spring wheat and sugar beets, Gov. George 
Sinner declared a drought disaster last week. North Dakota State University 
estimates this year's losses so far at $540 million, about half of what drought 
cost the state last year. 
</P>
<P>
Wells providing drinking water to more than 100 small towns in Missouri, Kansas 
and Iowa have dried up, reported Donald A. Wilhite, director of the University 
of Nebraska's Center for Agricultural Meteorology and Climatology. 
</P>
<P>
Drought in Colorado has not only made conditions ripe for wildfires but also is 
driving black bears from their rugged mountain homes into the populated 
foothills around Denver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dutch Elm Disease 
</P>
<P>
Botanists in the suburbs of Chicago have reported the worst outbreak of deadly 
Dutch elm disease in 15 years as infected beetles prey on drought-weakened elm 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
Even farmers in Nebraska who used irrigation to escape the full thrust of last 
summer's drought are being affected this year because, unlike 1988, they began 
the 1989 growing season with fields that had virtually no stored moisture. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year people in the state were saying, 'What drought?' " said Wilhite. 
"This year they had the driest March on record for much of Nebraska. In 
two-thirds of the state rainfall was only 50% of normal. April was about the 
same. In May about half the state had only 10% of its normal rain and much of 
the rest of the state had only 50% of normal rainfall. Those three months were 
just devastating." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Winter Crop Losses 
</P>
<P>
Drought losses to the winter wheat crop in Kansas this spring are now estimated 
at close to $1 billion and may be larger when the harvest is completed in the 
next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is already at work on disaster legislation to help farmers hurt both 
by drought and by floods that affected farms in the East, South and Southeast. 
Last year farmers received close to $3 billion in government drought aid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insecticide Legislation 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota Legislature -- aware that grasshoppers thrive in drought because 
it eliminates the moisture-fed diseases and fungus that control them -- this 
year approved a controversial law requiring farmers to control locusts. If they 
refuse, local governments have the power to spray insecticides and to add the 
cost of spraying to a farmer's annual tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was opposed by environmentalists who claimed spraying could 
harm wildlife and other beneficial insects, such as bees. Organic farmers, who 
use no chemicals on their crops, opposed it -- as did farmers who have agreed 
to take their land out of production for 10 years in exchange for a relatively 
small annual payment from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Harsh Words' 
</P>
<P>
Clashes have erupted between farmers who want the bugs sprayed and those 
opposed to the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no violence, just a lot of harsh words," said Paul Anderson, a 
farmer in Warren, a member of the Marshall Township board and the township 
clerk. "It gets to be neighbor against neighbor. Usually it takes (a conflict 
over) water to create this kind of problem." 
</P>
<P>
"Most farmers want to spray," said Eldor Omdahl, 79, a retired farmer who has 
refused to spray. Omdahl donated 640 acres of his land in nearby Polk County to 
the Audubon Society for a bird and wildlife sanctuary, and spraying, he said, 
threatens the animals and birds. The remainder of his land is in the government 
reserve program and has no crops on it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of tension there. We don't know who will make the first move," 
said Omdahl, standing near his garden that has been largely eaten by 
grasshoppers. "They wanted my brother to spray and he ordered them off his 
land. It's a destructive situation. You have township officials administering 
the law and they are all biased farmers. . . . We didn't know anything about 
the law until the grasshoppers came. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cost issue with me," Omdahl added. "One of the reasons I put it in the 
(federal reserve) is for the money. But I like to protect wildlife. That's why 
I gave it to Audubon."

MYSTERY FLIGHT'S PILOT SAYS HE CAN'T REMEMBER GUNSHOT TO ABDOMEN

<P>
Lawyer Thomas Root told federal investigators Saturday that he had no idea how 
he suffered the bullet wound to his abdomen that doctors discovered after he 
was pulled from the Atlantic Ocean at the conclusion of a mysterious six-hour 
airborne odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
Root suggested to investigators that he may have suffered from oxygen 
deprivation, causing him to lose consciousness during the flight, National 
Transportation Safety Board official Andrew Alston told reporters after his 
40-minute interview with Root at the Hollywood, Fla., hospital where Root is 
recuperating. 
</P>
<P>
But Alston said "inconsistencies" between Root's statements and other available 
evidence must be resolved before the agency can determine what occurred during 
the attorney's bizarre 800-mile plane trip, which began Thursday morning in 
Washington and ended when his Cessna 210 Citation crashed about 14 miles off 
the Bahamian island of Eleuthera. 
</P>

'Large Inconsistency' 
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to disbelieve him at this point," Alston said. "We have some 
questions. . . . He doesn't remember a gunshot wound and we see one. That is a 
large inconsistency that we hope to resolve." 
</P>
<P>
An FBI agent separately interviewed Root on Saturday at the hospital, where he 
is in intensive care and listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
While no new evidence emerged to explain Root's shooting, documents drawn from 
official files of the Federal Communications Commission are shedding additional 
light on Root's troubled business affairs and those of the Georgia company with 
which he has been closely associated, Sonrise Management Services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Fears 'Sham' 
</P>
<P>
Applications for FM radio station licenses that were organized by Sonrise "bear 
all the indicia of the classic 'sham,' " one FCC law judge wrote in an official 
order filed earlier this year. The activities of Sonrise "could turn out to be 
a scam on innocent investors," Judge Walter C. Miller wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Root represented the applications before the commission and drew criticism for 
missing deadlines and appointments in pursuing them. 
</P>
<P>
The company is being investigated by regulatory officials in North Carolina and 
has attracted attention in several other Southeastern states. In addition, 
several federal regulatory agencies are examining both Sonrise's operations and 
Root's legal practice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Draws Comment 
</P>
<P>
Sonrise's recruitment of radio station investors was widely commented upon 
within the tightly knit community of lawyers here who handle license 
applications before the FCC, but they were unknown to the general public until 
after Root's dramatic plane flight raised questions about a possible suicide 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Root took off from Washington early Thursday en route to a legal proceeding in 
Rocky Mount, N.C. Shortly before arriving there he told air controllers that he 
was having trouble breathing, his plane veered off course and began heading 
south down the Atlantic Coast. About six hours and 800 miles after his takeoff, 
the plane ran out of gas and crashed into the water, at which point Root, 
wounded but alive, swam away. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very lucky guy," his attending surgeon, Dr. Robert Cohen, told the 
Miami Herald. "I don't know if he wanted to be lucky. We'll find out sooner or 
later." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suicide Attempt Denied 
</P>
<P>
Finding out, however, could be difficult. Root's family members, who have been 
visiting him in Hollywood Memorial Hospital, deny police suggestions that the 
gunshot wound he suffered two inches above his navel was self-inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
Root told investigators Saturday that he kept a loaded .32-caliber Smith &amp; 
Wesson revolver in the glove compartment of his Cessna 210. Family members have 
speculated that the gun could have gone off when the plane hit the ocean, but 
police say that powder burns on Root's skin indicate that the gun was fired at 
close range. 
</P>
<P>
Both the plane and the gun are now at the bottom of the ocean, several thousand 
feet down, and officials have no plans to try to raise them. And the NTSB's 
Alston said doctors would be unlikely to be able to tell exactly when Root had 
been shot, noting that the application of a pressure bandage on the wound 
immediately after Root was pulled from the water would make such a 
determination difficult. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blood Test Awaited 
</P>
<P>
The safety board does expect blood test results on Monday that may shed light 
on Root's suggestion that he suffered oxygen deprivation or the early theory by 
some investigators that he had blacked out from carbon monoxide inhalation. 
Oxygen deprivation would be unusual at the altitude Root was flying -- 10,000 
feet -- investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Root's mysterious trip has focused attention on his business ventures with 
Sonrise, which has organized at least 163 partnerships to apply for licenses to 
operate small FM stations across the country, including 16 in California. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, according to a sworn declaration submitted to the FCC earlier this 
year by the firm's chairman, Ralph M. Savage, Sonrise would collect about 
$90,000 from the investors, with $11,000 of it going to license application 
fees and engineers. Sonrise and its salesmen would keep about $47,000 while 
Root would take $32,000 for legal fees, Savage wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Stations Operating 
</P>
<P>
Sonrise and Root together would have taken in roughly $13 million over the last 
two years from investors, according to those figures. None of the investors 
have yet won permission to operate an FM station, according to FCC files. 
</P>
<P>
Commission lawyers have questioned whether the partnerships organized by 
Sonrise and represented by Root were independent or actually controlled and 
directed by Sonrise. Commission rules forbid any single owner from controlling 
more than 14 FM stations. In depositions given during commission proceedings 
and in interviews with The Times, several investors in Sonrise projects 
appeared to have only a passing familiarity with the projects they were 
applying for. 
</P>
<P>
Root has repeatedly been chastised by FCC officials for procedural failures. A 
year and a half ago, a lawyer opposing Root in a case filed affidavits charging 
him with having falsified a document submitted to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Trade Reports 
</P>
<P>
Separately, several news organizations have reported that federal officials are 
investigating whether Root may have been involved in the drug trade, although 
little evidence of that has surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
Root's brother, Todd Root of Burlingame, Calif., on Saturday strongly denied an 
ABC News report that the Customs Service had placed Root's plane on a 
drug-related watch list after it made several trips to the Caribbean. His 
brother, Todd Root told reporters, had no involvement in drug trafficking and 
had never flown the plane outside the United States.

CHINA ACTS TO CURB WEST'S INFLUENCE;

Newly appointed Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, acknowledging 
that Western values have won wide support among China's youth, has called for 
greater ideological control on university campuses, official media reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang's comments, made Friday at a national conference on higher education, 
came as authorities stepped up restrictions on access to domestic and foreign 
publications that challenge China's harsh new official orthodoxy. As portrayed 
in the state-controlled media, leading reformers and pro-democracy student 
demonstrators now have become counterrevolutionaries and criminals. 
</P>
<P>
The latest step aimed at wiping out uncensored views has been the removal of 
foreign newspapers and magazines from luxury hotels in Beijing. These 
publications -- including Hong Kong newspapers in English and Chinese, the 
International Herald Tribune and major U.S., European and East Asian 
newsmagazines -- routinely carry accounts of events in China that vary sharply 
with the official line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Not Clear' 
</P>
<P>
A sales clerk at the Jianguo Hotel, asked Saturday why no foreign publications 
were available, replied with a time-honored phrase traditionally used by 
Chinese to deal with dangerous questions during times of political crisis: "Bu 
qingchu," meaning, "It's not clear." 
</P>
<P>
If the ban on imported publications continues, visiting foreign business people 
and tourists in Beijing will have virtually no access to information on events 
outside China or to uncensored reports on developments inside the country. 
China has one English-language newspaper, the China Daily, but it carries only 
a small quantity of foreign news. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign residents of Beijing, however, have so far continued to receive their 
subscriptions to overseas publications, which come primarily by air from Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
A crackdown on domestic Chinese-language publications, including books by 
reformist intellectuals, is also being intensified. 
</P>
<P>
The state Press and Publications Administration has issued an urgent circular 
calling for the confiscation and destruction of books "related to planning and 
organizing counterrevolutionary rebellion, advocating bourgeois liberalization 
(a code term for Western-style civil liberties), pornographic publications and 
those spreading superstition," the China Daily reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influence of West 
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who replaced reformist leader Zhao Ziyang after a bloody military 
crackdown on pro-democracy protesters last month, said in his speech at the 
education conference that "quite a number of young people have been greatly 
influenced by Western culture and ideology in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
"Yet we have slackened correct ideological education among them," Jiang said. 
"As a result, they are not mentally prepared to face the hardships and 
complexities in socialist construction and reform." 
</P>
<P>
Jiang acknowledged, according to a report in the official People's Daily, that 
many young people wonder whether socialism or capitalism is superior, and they 
question why the Communist Party must continue to rule China. 
</P>
<P>
To deal with this, Jiang said, more political workers should be assigned to 
conduct "Marxist education" among young people, "so as to help them realize 
that the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system are 
indispensable for China to become prosperous." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese media reports Saturday indicated that the effort to exert ideological 
control now has extended even to Hong Kong, where the rebellious director of a 
leading Beijing-controlled newspaper, Wen Wei Bao, has been fired. 
</P>
<P>
State-run television reported that Lee Tze-chung, 78, was fired under 
instructions from the Hong Kong office of China's New China News Agency, which 
exercises control over Wen Wei Bao. 
</P>
<P>
Under Lee's leadership, the newspaper had maintained a reformist course, 
favoring the now-disgraced Zhao even after his fall from power and the 
subsequent massacre of pro-democracy protesters in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was replaced by Chen Bojian, a former vice director of the New China News 
Agency who was already working at Wen Wei Bao. Lee had attempted to fire Chen 
on Friday for attempting to stop the paper from criticizing the June 3-4 
military massacre in Beijing, according to a report by the Associated Press 
from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper had previously stated that official accounts of the crackdown 
were lies and called hard-line Premier Li Peng, President Yang Shangkun and 
senior leader Deng Xiaoping "a gang of thieves." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities apparently have decided that they must impose greater 
limits on access inside China to this kind of reporting, even if tighter 
restrictions disrupt attempts to lure business people and tourists back to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
The new crackdown on the sale of foreign publications at hotels was 
foreshadowed at an art and literary forum held Thursday under sponsorship of 
the Central Propaganda Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"During the unrest, some people used Hong Kong newspapers and magazines to 
support the wholesale import of Western values," Liu Baiyu, an author, said at 
the forum, according to a report by the Guangming Daily. "We must oppose this 
at all costs."

SPURRED BY SOVIET BUILDUP, U.S. TO BOOST AID TO AFGHAN REBELS 
</P>

Responding to a massive increase in Soviet shipments of military supplies to 
the Kabul government, the Bush Administration has decided to increase its arms 
supply to the Afghan resistance and will provide ordnance capable of destroying 
Afghan government airfields and aircraft, according to Administration 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
A senior official, disclosing U.S. intentions to increase shipments after a 
lull, expressed considerable irritation at what he described as the Soviet 
decision to make "an extraordinary (military) investment" to Afghanistan after 
the final Soviet troop withdrawal from that country on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets have put in orders of a magnitude more than we had anticipated and 
that they had ever done before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions of both superpowers to escalate arms deliveries despite their 
15-month-old agreement to end outside interference in Afghanistan suggest that 
both sides are determined to back a full-scale showdown between their 
respective Afghan allies, minimizing chances of an early political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, Washington and Moscow agreed to act as "guarantors" of the 
Geneva accords that the Soviets hoped would serve as "a model" for joint 
superpower efforts in resolving regional conflicts. The accords provided for 
the withdrawal of 115,000 Soviet troops stationed in Afghanistan and an end to 
outside involvement there. 
</P>
<P>
The senior U.S. official said that the Soviet Union had been "pumping in" arms 
at the rate of $200 million to $300 million a month since early March. By 
contrast, the United States at the height of its covert military program for 
the rebels supplied in one year a little more than $600 million worth. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States, which has continued to arm the rebels, began to reduce 
that assistance in the expectation that the Kabul government would collapse 
rapidly once the Soviet troops withdrew. In addition, the United States was 
ending, or cutting sharply, the supply of the most sophisticated weapons, such 
as Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and long-range heavy mortars. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the unexpected massive Soviet supply to Kabul is partly to 
blame for the poor performance by the Afghan resistance on the battlefield so 
far.

SOVIET PARTY, MINE OFFICIALS JOIN COAL STRIKES IN SIBERIA

Local Communist Party officials and mine executives have joined strikes in the 
Kuzbass coal region of western Siberia to protest centralized control over the 
industry, Soviet newspapers reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Mining Ministry and regional party committees appealed to 
miners in at least nine cities to return to work, according to dispatches from 
Kuzbass, one of the country's most important coal producing regions. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers described a chaotic situation in Kuzbass, which is about 2,560 miles 
east of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has developed into a battle by miners and mine executives to 
wrest control from the Moscow-based ministry, the newspaper Soviet Russia said. 
The miners want authority to set production levels and improve working 
conditions, housing, schools and food, it said. 
</P>
<P>
"Strike committees have formed in the mines," the paper reported. "Most of the 
people in authority have joined them. That includes many Communists, trade 
union representatives and party secretaries." 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of miners met Saturday night with Coal Industry Minister 
Mikhail I. Shchadov in Prokopevsk, about 1,600 miles east of Moscow, according 
to the official Tass news agency and a local mine official. 
</P>
<P>
"The minister is promising help," said Yevgeny G. Koslov, an assistant mine 
surveyor in Prokopevsk. "They are having a dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party newspaper Socialist Industry identified two mining 
executives who joined the strikes as Mikhail I. Naidov, head of a group of 
mines in Prokopevsk, and I.A. Khamin, director of the Baidayevsky mine in a 
town not identified. 
</P>
<P>
"Independence is just not possible," Naidov said, because Moscow-based 
ministries make up to 90% of the economic decisions affecting local enterprises 
and governments. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'You just mine the coal, and we will guarantee the rest,' " 
Socialist Industry quoted Naidov as saying. 
</P>
<P>
"But people do not have what they were guaranteed. People have nothing 
worthwhile, no housing, no food, no leisure facilities," said Naidov. 
</P>
<P>
"This is intolerable. It is not the mine but the individual who should be the 
master. The essence of the protest is this: We want to work more effectively," 
he was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Strikes have been spreading throughout Kuzbass, despite settlements reported 
with miners in two cities, Osiniki and Mezhdurechensk, where the strikes began 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had reported an end to the strikes Thursday, but miners then 
expanded their agenda from economic issues such as food, housing and health 
care to broader demands for political change. 
</P>
<P>
The government newspaper Izvestia, however, said the strikes spread because no 
one explained to residents of the region that the settlement in Mezhdurechensk 
applied to the entire area. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, thousands of miners and their families held rallies in towns 
throughout the region, newspapers reported. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis was the worst in Prokopevsk, where production was virtually halted, 
Socialist Industry reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Events in the Kuzbass have taken a sharp turn," the newspaper said. Although 
miners returned to work in Mezhdurechensk, in other mining towns in the area 
"the situation has sharply intensified." 
</P>
<P>
Published reports said miners were striking in nine cities in all.

A bomb hidden in a truck in downtown Kabul exploded Saturday, shattering the 
quiet of a Muslim holiday and killing at least nine people and wounding 49, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion prompted officials to increase security, which had been relaxed 
during the three-day Eid al-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice) holiday. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the Soviet-backed 
government blamed U.S.-backed Muslim guerrillas and unnamed "foreign agents." 
</P>
<P>
The bomb, which experts say may have contained as much as 1,100 pounds of 
dynamite, exploded at noon in a crowded bazaar area near the city's center, 
police and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion blew a crater six feet wide and three feet deep in the road, 
officials said. 
</P>

Hospital sources said at least 10 of the injured were in critical condition.

POLISH PAPER CALLS PROTEST AT AUSCHWITZ A 'PROVOCATION'

Poland's government newspaper Saturday described a protest by a group of Jews 
against a Roman Catholic convent at the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz as 
an "organized provocation" that terrified the convent's nuns. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Rzeczpospolita did not report that the seven American Jewish 
protesters, led by Rabbi Avraham Weiss of New York, were attacked and dragged 
away Friday by six Polish workers as police, priests and residents looked on. 
</P>
<P>
"How harmful religious fanaticism can be seems to be evidenced by this unusual 
incident," the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
It called the protesters the aggressors. "The attackers demanded, with 
specially prepared placards and hostile shouts, that the Carmelite nuns leave 
the convent," it said. They were guilty of an "organized provocation," it 
added. 
</P>
<P>
A report by the news agency PAP in other newspapers also ignored the violence 
against the protesters and accused them of shouting at the nuns in a hostile 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's new chief rabbi, Pinhas Menahem Joskovich, who arrived from Israel a 
few weeks ago, was not available for comment on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first violence in a dispute between the Roman Catholic Church and 
Jews outside Poland over the convent, established beside the former outer wall 
of the Auschwitz camp in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Jews say the convent is an intrusion because most camp victims were Jewish and 
Auschwitz is the most symbolic site of the Nazi Holocaust, in which 6 million 
Jews were killed. An estimated 2 million of the victims at Auschwitz were 
Jewish. Many of the others killed were Christians. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church agreed in 1986 to remove the nuns by last Feb. 22, but no 
action has been taken.

Friday's protest ended after a few hours, but the account in Rzeczpospolita 
described the nuns as being under siege from attackers who entered their 
grounds by climbing a seven-foot fence. 
</P>
<P>
"The Carmelite nuns are terrified by this turn of events, as they are cut off 
from the world and food supplies and mail are not reaching them," the newspaper 
said.

The group Food Not Bombs, which refuses to get a permit to distribute food to 
the homeless, defied a court order Saturday and resumed serving meals to people 
living across from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
One man was arrested as a breakfast of rice and cereal was given to people who 
apparently were camping under the olive trees at Civic Center Plaza, police 
said. The resumption of the giveaway came one day after police shut down the 
group's food program because it lacked a permit. Officers in riot gear clashed 
with activists and some of the homeless and arrested 10 people.

TWO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES FULLY CONTAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two raging Northern California fires, including one that scorched more than 
3,000 acres along the scenic Big Sur coastline, were declared fully contained 
late Saturday and a Riverside County blaze that torched more than 1,000 acres 
was brought under control, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 firefighters were still battling the timber-fed blazes in 
Northern California on Saturday, one in Lassen National Forest 18 miles 
northwest of Susanville and the week-old Big Sur fire still raging near the 
Ventana wilderness area. 
</P>
<P>
But state forestry officials said they encircled the two fires shortly before 
sundown and expected to bring them safely under control as early as tonight. 
"We don't expect them to escape," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lassen fire erupted shortly before 1 p.m Friday, after being accidentally 
started by a woodcutter, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Bernice Rummel said. 
By Saturday morning, the blaze had burned 400 acres, but light winds and gentle 
terrain helped firefighters win 50% containment by noon. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 firefighters battled the Lassen blaze, which burned just north of 
California 44. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 1,140-acre fire burning in foothills in Riverside County was 
brought under control. The blaze, on state land four miles east of San Jacinto, 
that was sparked by tractor exhaust Friday, consumed a two-story house and two 
mobile homes and forced about 250 homeowners and campers to evacuate. More than 
1,000 firefighters were on the lines. Three suffered heat exhaustion and two 
were slightly hurt in falls. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal firefighters, assisted by firefighters from Los Angeles and 
Riverside counties, used five air tankers, two helicopters, 51 engines, 10 
bulldozers and 36 hand crews to battle the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
In Big Sur, crews battled three flare-ups Friday and gradually began choking 
off the arson blaze, which has raced across the steep, brush-laden terrain 
since July 8. The flare-ups delayed some of the 1,560 firefighters on hand from 
finishing three miles of containment line along the blaze's northern flank near 
Molera State Park, according to forestry officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very, very tired," said Ted Bishop, a fire captain with the forestry 
department. "We finally are beginning to get this fire under hand, but it's 
been a tough battle." 
</P>
<P>
One firefighter, a prison inmate, was killed earlier in the week when a tree 
fell on him, and several others have been injured. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to 
the arrest and conviction of the person believed to have started the fire last 
week. On Friday the governor also approved an extra $4.9 million for the 
forestry department because of the extreme drought conditions throughout the 
state.

ANGELS CRY FOUL AFTER ORIOLES WIN, 11-9; 
</P>
<P>
BULLPEN LETS ONE GET AWAY ON DEVEREAUX'S DISPUTED HOME RUN IN NINTH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Rader's postgame address unfolded about the same way as the game he had 
just witnessed -- starting slowly, gradually gaining steam and then, finally, 
exploding. 
</P>
<P>
"Any loss is tough, but it's especially tough to lose them that way," Rader 
began, moments after his Angels were defeated in the bottom of the ninth 
inning, 11-9, by the Baltimore Orioles Saturday night on a controversial home 
run by Mike Devereaux. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a ballgame because we couldn't throw the ball over the plate and 
because a foul ball was called fair. I'm not saying that from a biased 
standpoint. Facts are facts. The ball was foul. We lose." 
</P>
<P>
Rader stared at the ground, mentally replaying Devereaux's drive down the 
left-field line and third-base umpire Jim Joyce's home-run signal. Rader's eyes 
narrowed into slits of red as he tried to fight back the words. 
</P>
<P>
He failed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to weigh my words very, very carefully," Rader said, "because the 
tempting thing would be to say that all you have to do is pop off in the press 
regarding the ineptitude or inadequacy of an umpiring crew and it seems to get 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"But being the diplomatic kind of person I am, I refuse to do that. But it sure 
seems to make some difference for some people . . . and I think that stinks." 
</P>
<P>
Rader's reference was as obvious as three of the names on Saturday's roster of 
umpires -- Jim McKean, Ken Kaiser and Larry Young. Those names comprise 
three-fourths of the crew that last week riled Baltimore Manager Frank Robinson 
to the point of threatening to retire. 
</P>
<P>
That threat ultimately went unheeded, but only after American League President 
Bobby Brown held an air-clearing meeting with Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
This series at Memorial Stadium reunited Robinson with McKean, Kaiser and 
Young, plus Joyce, who was filling in for regular member John Shulock, who is 
on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
And by Rader's implication, that reunion involved a gun-shy umpiring crew. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason this game took so long was because the strike zone was the size of 
this," Rader said, tossing a matchbook on his desk. "And all of a sudden, the 
foul pole is extended 10 feet south. 
</P>
<P>
"To lose a game like that is a shame." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels lost this one after rolling up a season-high 19 hits -- including 
four by utility outfielder Max Venable -- and taking a 9-7 lead into the bottom 
of the ninth inning with bullpen closer Bryan Harvey on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
As has been the norm with Harvey in recent weeks, he was wild. With one out in 
the ninth, he walked Mickey Tettleton and Randy Milligan, threw two wild 
pitches and surrendered a two-run single to pinch-hitter Larry Sheets. 
</P>
<P>
Tie game, 9-9. 
</P>
<P>
Out went Harvey and in came Bob McClure, Rader's third relief pitch of the 
night. Up stepped Devereaux, the former Dodger outfielder who began this series 
mired in a 1-for-23 slump. 
</P>
<P>
McClure worked the count to 1 and 1, then made a third offering that Devereaux 
drove down the left-field line. The ball hooked toward the foul pole and landed 
in the seats. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce called the ball fair, waving Devereaux around the bases on a game-winning 
home-run trot that ended in a joyous Oriole celebration at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety feet up the third-base line, however, livid Angels were converging on 
Joyce. Third baseman Jack Howell and Rader began the protest, which was 
heatedly picked up along the first-base line by Marcel Lachemann, the normally 
mild-mannered pitching coach who, in this instance, had to be restrained from 
Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best barometer of all," Rader said. "Marcel Lachemann is the 
consummate gentleman. To see him in that condition should indicate clearly how 
inadequate some people are." 
</P>
<P>
Television replays appeared to support the Angels' contention, showing 
Devereaux's ball slicing right to left in front of the foul pole. 
</P>
<P>
Crew chief McKean, speaking on behalf of Joyce, said: "I saw two replays of it 
and they were inconclusive. I couldn't tell from where I was. It was that 
close. But Jim Joyce called it a home run." 
</P>
<P>
And about Rader's remarks regarding the fallout from last week's dispute 
between Robinson and McKean's crew? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no comment to that," McKean said. 
</P>
<P>
A plate umpire has the authority to override a questionable home-run call, but 
Rader said that, given Saturday's circumstances, such an idea had no chance. 
</P>
<P>
"No way on earth," he said. "One team was already off the field. There were 
47,000 (Oriole) fans in the stands. And all the ruckus we were making? 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way in the world that play would get overturned, even if it meant 
getting it right. And that's a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Rader said he hadn't seen a replay but also said he didn't need one. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so obvious," he said. "That's the part that's so disturbing. It was so 
obvious. That's the most frustrating thing about it all." 
</P>
<P>
Even more so when your team wastes 19 hits -- including home runs by Dick 
Schofield and Lance Parrish -- and leads of 1-0, 3-1, 7-3, 8-6 and 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the real shame about a game like that," Rader repeated. "So many 
wonderful things by our players get overshadowed by it. 
</P>
<P>
"Max Venable gets four hits. Who's going to remember that tomorrow? Dick 
Schofield does some good things with the bat and on the basepaths. Who's going 
to remember that tomorrow? The heroics by a lot of our people are going to be 
completely forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
One swing of the bat and one circle of an umpire's right arm were all it took 
to rub them out. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels sent slumping pitcher Kirk McCaskill (2-5, 6.69 earned-run average 
in his last seven starts) back to Los Angeles for a medical examination. Dr. 
Lewis Yocum diagnosed the problem as an irritation in the joint of McCaskill's 
right elbow. McCaskill received an injection and was placed on a different 
dosage of the anti-inflammatory medication he had been taking. "For a long 
time, it looked like his arm was tired," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. 
"Considering how (little) he's pitched the last couple of years, that's to be 
expected. Some fatigue has set in there, and we wanted Dr. Yocum to look at him 
and check him out." Rader said he is considering skipping McCaskill's next turn 
in the rotation, scheduled for Thursday in Anaheim against Detroit. "If it's in 
Kirk McCaskill's best interest to take it very conservatively, then we will do 
so," Rader said. "We have an off-day Wednesday, so skipping him is no big deal. 
We can still keep everybody else on schedule." That would mean starting Chuck 
Finley in McCaskill's place, since Finley still would have had four days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Tettleton's steal of third base in the fourth inning was the first by a 
Baltimore catcher since Floyd Rayford accomplished it on Sept. 14, 1985. The 
Orioles definitely pick their spots when they attempt this. The opposing 
catcher on that date, too, was Lance Parrish, then playing for the Detroit 
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore's Phil Bradley saw his 16-game hitting streak come to an end when he 
went hitless in three at-bats and five plate appearances. Bradley also walked 
twice, including once with the bases loaded in the eighth inning, forcing home 
Bob Melvin with Baltimore's seventh run of the evening. . . . Max Venable's 
four-hit game was the first of his career. It came against the team that 
released him before the 1988 season, which resulted in Venable sitting out the 
year before signing a minor-league contract with the Angels last winter.

HOLYFIELD KO'S BRAZILIAN IN 2ND, SEEKS TYSON BOUT

The right fist moved swiftly through the cool, crisp air, landing on Adilson 
Rodrigues' right temple. He froze momentarily, as if shocked by the impact. 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues kicked his left leg high and crashed to the deck on his back, where 
he remained for 90 seconds after being counted out. 
</P>
<P>
With that one punch, and a right uppercut that set it up midway through the 
second round, Evander Holyfield appeared to have set up an early 1990 showdown 
with heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, who will fight Carl Williams Friday night 
in Atlantic City, N.J. Holyfield, who has now won 22 consecutive pro fights 
after a Yugoslavian referee threw him out of the 1984 Olympics, has stopped 
four heavyweights since moving up from the cruiserweight class last summer. 
</P>
<P>
For four minutes, before about 5,500 fans at Caesars Tahoe's outdoor stadium, 
Holyfield didn't look like the prohibitive favorite he was made by oddsmakers. 
In fact, many ringsiders gave Rodrigues the first round based on his fast 
start. 
</P>
<P>
"What you saw in that first round was what I envisioned for the whole fight," 
said Rodrigues' trainer, Angelo Dundee. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, Evander had other ideas. When you can KO a big heavyweight with 
one punch like that . . . that speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
Dundee wasn't nearly as diplomatic during the fight. In the first round, from 
the corner, he called Holyfield a "two-dollar bum." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, who at 207 pounds came in lighter than expected, caught the slightly 
puffy-looking, 221-pound Rodrigues at center ring. That silenced several 
hundred Brazilians, who were on their feet waving blue-green pom-pons and 
cheering wildly after their man's impressive first round. 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues began the second quickly, too, starting Holyfield off with some more 
jolting left jabs. But 30 seconds into the round, Holyfield caught the 
Brazilian on the ropes, where he landed some telling body shots. 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues, rocked for the first time, scrambled away, seeking refuge at center 
ring. But Holyfield caught him there with a right to the face that landed with 
a thud. 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues came apart in about five seconds. First came a short, right uppercut 
to the jaw that snapped his head back and caused him to back up a step. But 
Holyfield didn't immediately follow up. Instead, he stepped in, threw an 
inconsequential left, and then reached back for the winning right. 
</P>
<P>
It was thrown quick and hard, slightly over the top of his shoulder, and caught 
Rodrigues high on the right side of his head. By the time Rodrigues (35-3) got 
up, the TV guys were in the ring, setting up for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Through a translator, Rodrigues talked to reporters afterward: 
</P>
<P>
Question: "Adilson, have you ever been hit harder than you were by that punch?" 
</P>
<P>
Answer: "No, that was the hardest." 
</P>
<P>
Q: "Which one, the uppercut or the straight right? 
</P>
<P>
A: "Both of them." 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues, who was the World Boxing Council's No. 2-ranked contender (behind 
Holyfield), praised his conqueror afterward but wasn't ready to concede him the 
heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think Tyson is the best, but Holyfield is very good. I didn't see the 
last two punches. That happens, sometimes, when heavyweights fight." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield said he decided in the first round to let Rodrigues have his way. 
</P>
<P>
"He surprised me by starting so fast, so I decided to slow down a little and 
try to throw off his rhythm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, I got thumbed slightly in the first. Usually, I start the fastest, but 
I'm working real hard now on patience, watching for the other guy to make a 
mistake. It's part of the art of boxing." 
</P>
<P>
The word is that Tyson-Holyfield won't come about until early 1990, in part 
because it's believed that Sugar Ray Leonard will fight Roberto Duran or Thomas 
Hearns in November, and promoters don't like to crowd the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
If Tyson-Holyfield goes on hold, Holyfield would probably take a tuneup. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to fight someone soon," said Holyfield's manager, Atlanta auto dealer 
Ken Sanders. "Tyson, preferably, but if not him, someone else." 
</P>
<P>
And what does Tyson think of all this? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he (Tyson) was watchin'," Holyfield said, smiling. "I try to get 
better in every fight, and I'm sure he understands now I'm getting better." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sanders: "Evander is going to be the heavyweight champion of the world 
because he's a better fighter than Tyson and a better person." 
</P>
<P>
No one else in the audience seemed willing to concede all of that, but 
Holyfield did seem to have made his point about improvement. And he does seem 
to hit harder than he did a year ago, when he stopped but couldn't knock James 
Tillis or Pinklon Thomas off their feet. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, the soles of Adilson Rodrigues' size-12s were clearly visible 
for a minute and a half, and the view seemed to impart a clear message.

GUIDRY LEAVES WITH STYLE, AND A TOUCH OF CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Guidry didn't give style and class to the New York Yankees, he only lent it 
to them. The games he won, the pitching he gave them, that he leaves behind. He 
takes the style and class with him. 
</P>
<P>
What he left in the record book is his 1978 season -- one of the greatest 
seasons any pitcher ever had. It deserves a mark of special designation. 
</P>
<P>
The point of it would recall that what Guidry accomplished and what he did in 
the midst of the thunder and lightning that were the Yankees of the new legend. 
Guidry stood up in the hail of fire and remained unscathed. It wasn't as if he 
didn't understand what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
Pick a spot to find a memory. No, not the tiebreaker game against the Boston 
Red Sox, although it certainly was worthy. He took them into the seventh inning 
with a lead. That was the pitcher he was that year. 
</P>
<P>
But remember the night in 1982 when Reggie Jackson came back to Yankee Stadium 
in a California Angels uniform for the first time after being cast aside? It 
was April 27 and it was raining, and the Angels had a 2-1 lead in the seventh 
inning. Jackson had no home runs. Guidry, who then had considerable powers, 
threw his considerable slider right where he wanted it and Jackson hit one of 
his lightning bolts against the facing of the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
Before Jackson reached second base, the fans were beating their hands together 
and chanting, "Reg-gie! Reg-gie!" 
</P>
<P>
On the mound, subtly as he could, Guidry was clapping his pitching hand into 
the palm of his mitt as one virtuoso giving credit to the maestro. 
</P>
<P>
Guidry understood it all, everything that went from right to left, left to 
right and top to bottom in the Yankees clubhouse. That night, he acknowledged 
what Jackson had given to him and to the Yankees. That was the night the fans 
chanted, in the vernacular of the 1980s teen-ager, "Steinbrenner!" 
</P>
<P>
They were saying in their way that the man who didn't want Jackson anymore 
stinks. Margaret Plunkett, who was teaching fifth grade at St. Andrew Avellino 
School in Flushing, N.Y., wrote that she understood. And Guidry understood. 
</P>
<P>
Over in his corner of the clubhouse -- the L-shaped cubicle that became his 
after Sparky Lyle vacated it -- Guidry observed and absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
He had been treated harshly on occasion and he saw others treated with less 
than the dignity they deserved. He acknowledged that, but he knew how to stop 
his commentary just before he brought the fire down on his own head. But it was 
clear where he stood. 
</P>
<P>
In his way, he was something out of Kipling's tale of the cat who walked by 
himself. He thrived because he understood how others shrank from the owner's 
rages. "The only person you can get back at is him," Guidry said. "You want to 
try harder to show him you're doing a good job. That's what he wants. I try to 
make him look like a fool." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, he made a fool of a lot of people. He was 25-3, his .893 percentage 
the best any 20-game-winner has ever had. His earned run average was 1.74. The 
Yankees were 30-5 in games he started. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is a game of streaks and Guidry stopped the losing kind; 15 of his 
victories followed losses. Not even the New York Mets' Dwight Gooden has had a 
season like that. 
</P>
<P>
Guidry objected to being second-guessed by Billy Martin, who later claimed he 
developed Guidry at a calculated pace. Remember that until April 1977 Martin 
identified Guidry as a minor-league relief pitcher. That evaluation sparked one 
of the more lively exchanges of a lively season. 
</P>
<P>
When Guidry took his place among the best starters in the league, Martin 
claimed foresight. "There were some people who wanted to get rid of Guidry in 
the spring," Martin said. "I wasn't one of them. Gabe Paul wasn't one of them. 
Maybe it was the trainer." 
</P>
<P>
"Billy says he wanted Guidry?" Steinbrenner responded. "That's a lie. Billy and 
I wanted him gone. Gabe wanted to keep him." 
</P>
<P>
Whitey Herzog wanted Guidry. Paul was the general manager who refused to trade 
Guidry to the Kansas City Royals that spring. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a meeting at the end of spring training, George, Billy and me," Paul 
said. "I was ordered to send Guidry out. I said, 'Let's make a deal: Understand 
that it's over my objection, and when he becomes a successful pitcher for some 
other organization, you take all the responsibility.' 
</P>
<P>
"Billy, he didn't say much. Calculated? When Guidry got the chance to start, it 
was out of necessity." So much for Martin's eye for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Guidry had that magnificent year in 1978. The next season, when Rich Gossage 
had his thumb broken and the bullpen was a desperate place, Guidry volunteered 
to pitch relief between starts. Some years before, when Warren Spahn was 
clinging by reputation to the end of a great career as a starter, the Atlanta 
Braves were desperate for bullpen help. Bobby Bragan asked the great man to 
pitch relief. Spahn refused; the bullpen was for someone lesser. 
</P>
<P>
Guidry had the best earned run average in the league for the second successive 
season. He won 18 games, pitched relief three times and had two saves. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't tell the club he'd go to the bullpen if his contract was reworked; he 
didn't demand a clause that protected him if he hurt his arm in relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get caught up in that," he said. "A lot of guys say I'm crazy 
not to try to get every little bit I can. But I don't need a lot of money to be 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
He was thinking about how he could help a team that needed what he could do. In 
a cynical world, he was a sigh of relief. And a touch of class.

DODGERS DISCOVER NEW WAYS TO TAKE A LOSS, 2-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coming up with more creative ways to fall on their faces than a professional 
wrestler, the Dodgers dropped another game Saturday night, this time with two 
tumbles that only looked fake. 
</P>
<P>
Ever heard of an inning where a team gets four hits, only one batter makes an 
out, and the team still doesn't score? 
</P>
<P>
If not, then you also probably haven't heard of an inning where the same team 
allows consecutive bunt singles that wind up costing it the game. 
</P>
<P>
That team is the Dodgers, who aroused a mixture of boos and walkouts from the 
sellout crowd of 45,517 at Dodger Stadium in a 2-0 loss to the St. Louis 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
The runs came on former Dodger Pedro Guerrero's two-run double in the eighth 
inning. With the bases loaded and one out against starter Fernando Valenzuela, 
and boos following Guerrero's every step, the ex-Dodger launched a 2-and-1 
pitch into the right-field gap to score two runs and increase his average 
against his old team this season to .375 (15 for 40). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why the Dodgers trade me, I don't care," Guerrero said after the 
Cardinals posted their ninth victory in 11 games against the Dodgers this 
season. "I'm just glad somebody wants me." 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal starter and winner Joe Magrane started the eighth with a single to 
left field. Vince Coleman bunted toward toward first baseman Eddie Murray, who 
was charging on the play. The ball rolled under Murray's glove, and Coleman was 
given more than he bargained for, a single, as Magrane moved to second. 
</P>
<P>
That bunt worked so well, Jose Oquendo did the same thing a couple of pitches 
later, putting the ball just to Valenzuela's right for another single, between 
the pitcher and third baseman Jeff Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the ball goes by the pitcher, the third baseman has to get it," Dodger 
Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
"Stuff like that tears a manager up," Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog said 
afterward. "You'd like to get at least one out in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers finally did get an out when Ozzie Smith's grounder forced Magrane 
at home. But up stepped Guerrero, and down went Valenzuela, who lost his fourth 
consecutive game, falling to 4-9 despite his first complete game in more than a 
year (since June 8, 1988, in Houston). 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela should have expected as much. In his four starts against the 
Cardinals this year, he has gone 0-3, while the Dodgers have scored one run. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really pitched well against us all year," Herzog said, shaking hishead. 
"And not a win." 
</P>
<P>
He has been victimized by innings such as the Dodgers' fifth, in which they had 
four hits and only one batter was out. The inning also featured Rick Dempsey's 
third stolen base in five years and Jose Gonzalez's first hit against the 
Cardinals in 19 at-bats this season. 
</P>
<P>
And yet the Dodgers didn't score. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey and Gonzalez started the fifth inning with consecutive singles to right 
field. It was Gonzalez's fourth hit in his last 35 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Valenzuela to bunt. After Valenzuela fouled off two attempts, 
Dempsey decided, what the heck, and took off from second base on the next 
pitch. The ball was outside, and with the Cardinals charging the plate, there 
was nobody to cover third base as Dempsey picked up his first stolen base of 
the year, equaling his season high for the last eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But then Dempsey and Valenzuela got creative. And things got weird. On a 
1-and-2 pitch, Valenzuela decided to swing away, but he topped the ball, 
bouncing it in front of the plate. Running from third on contact, Dempsey found 
himself caught between third and home. He was tagged out in a rundown by third 
baseman Terry Pendleton, who then noticed Gonzalez wandering off second base. 
Pendleton threw, second baseman Jose Oquendo tagged, and the Cardinals had the 
double play. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked ugly, but it was a heckuva play," Herzog said. "Pendleton got caught 
by Dempsey the first time, but we got him back." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers came back with consecutive singles by Alfredo Griffin and Willie 
Randolph to load the bases. But Mickey Hatcher, on a one-strike pitch, grounded 
the ball to Pendleton to end the inning: No runs, four hits, three left. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, in a bit of timing that Dodger officials probably found 
curious, the left-field scoreboard showed a television replay of former Dodger 
Mike Devereaux, traded to the Baltimore Orioles in the spring, defeating the 
Angels with a home run. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem is, we put ourselves in a situation where we realize one hit could 
turn this game, this season around," Hatcher said. "I don't know if that puts 
added pressure on us or what, but that's what I was thinking when I was 
batting. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of saying, 'Hey, I'll get a hit and we'll win,' I'm thinking about 
this being a big situation where we really need a hit. Maybe we are thinking 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, Hatcher made one of the best acrobatic catches of the 
year, saving at least two runs. With runners on first and third, Pendleton 
drove the ball into the left-field corner, but Hatcher backhanded the ball on 
the run before tumbling into the left-field wall, where he lay still for 
several seconds while teammates rushed to his aid. But before they arrived, he 
jumped up, held up his glove to show the ball inside and ran into the dugout to 
a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't stumble, I don't make the catch," Hatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
After Saturday's game, the Dodgers announced that outfielder Chris Gwynn will 
be sent to Albuquerque today to make room for utilityman Mariano Duncan, who 
will return from the 15-day disabled list, where he had been placed with a 
strained hamstring. Gwynn, who said he is still not able to run hard after 
breaking his foot June 12, has hit .235 in 32 games. He just came off the 
disabled list July 6. This leaves the Dodgers with one more move, when they 
bring Ramon Martinez up from Albuquerque Monday. The likely candidate for 
demotion -- if he'll accept it -- is pitcher Ricky Horton. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Frank Jobe, Dodger medical director, confirmed that the results of Kirk 
Gibson's hamstring scan showed no abnormalities. Jobe emphasized, however, that 
soft tissue problems would not show up on the scan, known as a magnetic 
resonance imaging test. Gibson's daily rehabilitation is to continue as 
scheduled, and he will remain in the lineup most of the time. The left-handed 
hitter did not start against St. Louis left-hander Joe Magrane, but he also did 
not start against Magrane last week in St. Louis. Gibson entered Saturday 
batting just .132 against left-handers, with 12 hits in 91 at-bats. He was 
hitting .286 against right-handers. Gibson's replacement, Mickey Hatcher, 
entered Saturday's game hitting .329 against left-handers.

WALKER EVANS' OPERATION GROWS WITH SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The growth of off-road racing from its infancy in 1969 to its stature among 
motor sports today can be seen in the growth of Walker Evans' garage. 
</P>
<P>
When Evans, 50, the pre-eminent truck driver among off-road racers, built his 
first Ford racing pickup 20 years ago, he did it in his family's back-yard 
garage of about 1,100 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Today, three shops later, his racing team occupies a 10,000-square-foot garage 
with a crew of 17 full-time employees. And on the drafting board is a 
25,000-foot shop he has planned for a three-acre site on the west side of town 
alongside Highway 60. 
</P>
<P>
The new site will have its own practice course in the sandy wasteland of the 
Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at it, the future of off-road racing is unlimited," Evans said. 
"We may have gone as far as we can with desert racing, which I might add is my 
true love, but I see stadium racing continuing to grow until it becomes a 
world-wide sport. It has the same potential as motocross, perhaps even more so, 
because more people drive cars and trucks than ride cycles, and motocross has 
an international following. Stadium racing is really still a very young sport." 
</P>
<P>
Stadium racing, which was the brainchild of the late Mickey Thompson, did not 
evolve until 1979, when the first event was held in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"Even after I retire, which will probably be after next year, I plan to 
continue running a team. I would like to be the Roger Penske of off-road 
racing." 
</P>
<P>
Evans' introduction to off-roading came in 1969 as a driver for actor James 
Garner's American Motors team in a Rambler sedan in the Baja 500. He finished 
third in his class, but was fascinated by the winning pickup driven by Ak 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"Garner folded his team, but I was hooked and I knew I had to get a pickup and 
race some more in the desert. The only way was to build my own, so that's what 
I did." 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, with help from Bill Stroppe, a pioneer in the sport as a builder of 
Ford off-road vehicles, Evans built his first pickup for a few thousand 
dollars. He won the truck class in the first race he drove it, the 1970 Baja 
500. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Evans directs a six-truck team that is divided between desert and 
stadium racing -- with Evans the star attraction driving either a 4,400-pound 
Dodge Ram 150 at speeds of 130 m.p.h. across a dry lake or bouncing a nimble 
2,550-pound Jeep Comanche over man-made jumps and bumps in a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The trucks he drives today cost between $100,000 and $120,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole life is dictated by the racing schedule," Evans said as he checked 
the race and prerun dates in his office. "The season starts in January with the 
Anaheim Stadium race and doesn't end until November with the Baja 1000." 
</P>
<P>
It was the 1979 Baja 1000 -- which Evans drove solo from Ensenada to La Paz in 
a huge stock Dodge truck and beat the nimble desert buggies built exclusively 
for high-speed racing across Baja's changing terrain -- that solidified Evans' 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"That win really caught a lot of people's attention," Evans said. "No one had 
even considered it possible before that a truck could beat the buggies. Since 
then, guys like Ivan Stewart and Robby Gordon have done it, but 10 years ago it 
was really something different." 
</P>
<P>
Next for Evans is Saturday's Mickey Thompson Gran Prix in the Coliseum where he 
and teammate Rob MacCachren, a casino parking lot attendant from Las Vegas, 
will drive Jeep Comanches in the Grand National sport truck class. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 12 it will be back to the desert in his Dodge Ram for the Pahrump 
Station Nevada 500, a High Desert Racing Assn. race from Pahrump to Tonopah and 
back. Evans also fields a companion Dodge truck for Steve McEachern of Phoenix 
in desert races. 
</P>
<P>
This year he is also campaigning two Jeeps in the desert. One, a Cherokee, has 
been driven by Evans' son, Evan, 24, in the production passenger car class. The 
other, a Comanche, is driven by MacCachren in the 4-wheel-drive mini-pickup 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Evan Evans won four races in a row and appeared about ready to move up to 
bigger and faster equipment, but he suffered a broken back in a motorcycle 
accident last Thursday night that may end his career. 
</P>
<P>
He is paralyzed from the waist down. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Evans was riding a dirt bike near his home when he hit a ditch in 
the darkness and crashed. He was taken to Riverside Community Hospital, where 
his condition is listed as critical. 
</P>
<P>
"Evan has shown good aptitude for racing," his father said the morning of the 
accident. "The way things are going, I figure he might be ready for the big 
truck about the time I retire." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Walker said by phone from the hospital: "Obviously, this is a 
terrible setback for Evan. We hope for a better prognosis later, but there is 
no way to know what his future is right now. We are moving him to Loma Linda 
Hospital Monday for special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to get somebody in his (race) car to finish out the season 
because of our commitment to the sponsor. And he'll be sorely missed in the 
shop, where he's been one of our best workers, but we're just keeping our 
fingers crossed that there will be some improvement. Right now, he has no 
feeling from his navel on down." 
</P>
<P>
Walker thought about retiring at the end of this season, but his recent 
successes and some pleading from the Chrysler management has extended his 
racing career at least through 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"When I have a bad day I think about it (retiring) a lot, but when I have a 
good day I don't think about it at all. On the other hand, I've won just about 
every race there is, so there are times that I wonder what am I doing pounding 
around out there with all those younger fellows." 
</P>
<P>
Evans' portfolio of 78 major desert wins includes nine Baja 1000s, seven Parker 
400s, six Baja 500s, eight Mint 400s, five Fireworks 250s and nine SCORE 
Riverside closed-course races. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, though, I want that win in the Coliseum so bad, both for my sponsor 
and for my own personal achievement. That would make three in a row, and I 
don't think anyone has ever won more stadium races than that in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Mears, in a Nissan, won three straight in 1985 and is the only one. Robby 
Gordon, Evans' chief antagonist this season, finished first four consecutive 
times, but in the third race, in Seattle, he was disqualified for rough driving 
and Glenn Harris was declared the winner. "I know I can do it, but I'll need a 
little bit of luck and some breaks," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Evans won his first race this year in the Astrodome and followed it with a win 
in the Rose Bowl, where he was bulldozed across the finish line by Gordon -- a 
circumstance that found the Toyota team driver again disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Robby learned his lesson that he can't do anything he wants and get 
away with it," Evans said. "He is a fantastic driver, but he's got a lot of 
growing up to do." 
</P>
<P>
Evans' schedule includes 23 races, 10 in stadiums, nine in the desert and four 
at Don Brown's Glen Helen Park facility in San Bernardino for closed-course 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"Driving in the desert, and in a stadium, is almost like being in two different 
sports," Evans said. "I enjoy them both, but they are very different. 
</P>
<P>
"The desert truck is enormous. After sitting in the snug compartment of a 
stadium truck, you climb in the desert Dodge and it feels like you're sitting 
in a huge room. When you start running, the power practically tears up the 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's geared to run 130 m.p.h., but it's scary when you go that fast because 
the steering wheel has no feeling and the truck is very unpredictable at those 
speeds. 
</P>
<P>
"The tires swell up so that only about an inch and a half of tire is actually 
making contact with the ground. All you're running on is the center of the 
crown of the tire. And you don't stop real well at those speeds, either. 
</P>
<P>
"The stadium Jeep, on the other hand, isn't geared for more than 45 or 50 
m.p.h., but it has fantastic acceleration. It will get from zero to 50 a heck 
of a lot quicker than the big truck and 45 is as fast as you'll ever need 
because you're always in a turn or going over a jump. 
</P>
<P>
"On the desert you can pace yourself, but once the flag drops in the stadium 
you'd better put your foot to the floor and keep it there. There is no margin 
for error. You just stand on it." 
</P>
<P>
Which is one reason Evans' associates call him Thunder Foot. 
</P>
<P>
Evans points out that there is much more to fielding a racing team than drivers 
and vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"People see our two stadium Jeeps and our four desert vehicles and think that's 
all there is, but that's only what's out front. 
</P>
<P>
"We also built and maintain 10 chase vehicles for the desert and three 
prerunners for practice, plus we have two 18-wheelers for hauling our trucks to 
and from the races. There are times, when the crew is loading and unloading, 
that I think we're a glorified Bekins (moving van company), carrying cars back 
and forth all the time." 
</P>
<P>
It also takes a lot of personnel to race in the desert. Evans must line up 27 
additional workers for a race such as the Baja 1000. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nine pit stops and need three men to a pit," he said. "They're all 
volunteers, guys who live around here and take an interest in what we're doing. 
They take all the equipment needed for each stop with them and do all the tire 
changing and refueling and whatever else we need." 
</P>
<P>
If 23 races, running a busy racing shop and maintaining a family isn't enough, 
Evans also flies his own Cessna 180 and recently purchased a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not entirely a hobby. The plane gets me from Riverside to a race a whole 
lot faster than driving or taking a commercial plane, and it also gets me to 
Utah in a little more than two hours to enjoy our winter cabin. The chopper is 
great for flying low over a course to check out all the situations. You can see 
things from above that you don't see on ground level. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no end to the details and the preparation needed to win off-road races 
today. The competition is just as intense as it is for an Indy car or a NASCAR 
race." 
</P>
<P>
Spoken just the way Roger Penske would have said it.

MIKE DOWNEY: MONEY NO CHALLENGE FOR NUNN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A janitor at the Las Vegas Hilton was sweeping up after an evening of 
prizefighting last March. His broom came across a small slip of paper that 
looked suspiciously like a fighter's prize. 
</P>
<P>
He picked it up. Pay to the order of Michael Nunn, the bank check read, the sum 
of $1,000,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, a million and change," Nunn remembered. 
</P>
<P>
The middleweight from North Hollywood had just successfully defended his 
International Boxing Federation championship by flattening some Italian speed 
bag with legs named Sumbu Kalambay in the first round. Nunn showered, changed 
into some clean sweats and stuffed his payday into his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Strolling back through the hotel, Nunn was approached by some autograph 
hunters. He had a pen in his pocket. He pulled it out. Something else fell out, 
but nobody noticed. Not until the janitor noticed later that night. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, the janitor did not run out and try to cash the check. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's he gonna go?" Nunn wondered. "7-Eleven?" 
</P>
<P>
In the archives of mislaid paychecks, Nunn's million-dollar (and some change) 
mistake breaks the old record of $40,000 set by golfer Roger Maltbie, who left 
his winnings on a bar counter after a tour victory in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
This tale of carelessness, told by Nunn and his manager, Dan Goossen, is meant 
to illustrate Nunn's indifference to the color of money. Oh, he likes the stuff 
all right. He just bought his mother a new home in Davenport, Iowa, his 
hometown, and bought a new house in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike wants more than just money," Goossen insisted. "He's not in boxing just 
to get rich." 
</P>
<P>
That poor janitor, meanwhile, returned the check without even wanting a reward. 
Refusing one, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to practically stuff it down his shirt," Goossen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine that guy, if he'd kept that check?" Nunn asked. "Can you 
imagine him ordering a cup of coffee and then pulling the million-dollar check 
out and telling the waitress: "All I got is this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Michael (Second to) Nunn is a man whose income has gone from none to some, fast 
on its way to more. He will risk his undefeated record and IBF championship 
belt Aug. 14 at Reno against Iran (the Blade) Barkley, a man who, in his last 
two fights, knocked out Thomas Hearns in three rounds and got robbed by a 
12-round decision that went to Roberto Duran. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Nunn-Barkley fight is expected to get a shot at either Hearns 
or Sugar Ray Leonard, whose draw last month might have been exasperating, but 
at least kept the middleweight class the most interesting division in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
Who really won Hearns-Leonard? 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy won the fight," Barkley believes. "He won it easily enough to get the 
decision. Didn't nobody give Tommy a chance but one person -- me. Leonard is 
tough and courageous, but he just don't punch as hard as Tommy -- or me." 
</P>
<P>
"If I was paid to be a judge," said Nunn, who probably would have lost the 
check anyway, "I would have to say that Sugar Ray Leonard lost to Thomas 
Hearns. But, since Ray's my all-time favorite, my idol, I'm not sorry how it 
turned out." 
</P>
<P>
So, if you beat Barkley . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When I beat Barkley." 
</P>
<P>
When you beat Barkley, who do you want next -- Leonard? Hearns? Duran? 
</P>
<P>
"I'll beat them all," Nunn said, shy like most boxers." 
</P>
<P>
This bout against Barkley surely will be Nunn's biggest test yet. Nunn, 26, 
began his career banging out first-round victories over a bunch of local tomato 
cans at a ring in Reseda. Eventually he worked his way up to fights with more 
respectable opponents such as Charlie Boston, who was ranked once, and Mike 
(Moving On) Tinley, a tough guy from Philly. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, last July, Nunn stopped 1984 Olympic champion Frank Tate in the ninth 
round to take the IBF title. Since then he has defended it against Juan Domingo 
Roldan and against Kalambay, knocking out both to improve his record to 33-0. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley is no pushover. He is a rough customer from the Bronx who first started 
fighting thanks to his sister, Yvonne, whom he described as "a tough 
135-pounder." She used to beat up guys from the neighborhood, then made the 
Blade fight any guy too large for her to handle. Barkley is the type who is not 
easily discouraged by a good puncher. 
</P>
<P>
"And we still don't know for sure," promoter Bob Arum chimed in. "Is Michael 
Nunn a good puncher or isn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
Nunn scoffs at the whole idea, saying he not only can punch, but he can take 
one. He is not scared one bit of the guy whose right hand put Hearns on his 
back in three. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody's always trying to label me, doubt me," he said. "Bob Arum can say 
whatever he wants. People been saying I'm a snapper, I'm a runner, I can't 
punch. But I'm 33-0, so I'm doing something right. Tell Barkley to leave his 
hands down and jump right at me. See if I can punch." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Nunn is putting his mouth where his money is. He has a championship 
belt and is about to receive another nice purse. All he needs is a decent 
wallet.

WHILE ROSE AWAITS RULING, INJURIES TO REDS ARE MAKING THE POINT MOOT

Why suspend or fire Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose? 
</P>
<P>
He seems to have already been taken out of the race in the National League West 
by injuries to key players. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds have put 10 players on the disabled list since late March and still 
have five on it: shortstop Barry Larkin, third baseman Chris Sabo, second 
baseman Ron Oester, set up man Rob Dibble and starting pitcher Ron Robinson, 
out since March 19 because of an elbow injury. 
</P>
<P>
Only first baseman Todd Benzinger and right fielder Paul O'Neill, among the 
regulars, have avoided the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
The siege started with Robinson in spring training, then spread to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Catcher Bo Diaz, who was on the disabled list for 25 days because of a knee 
injury and is sidelined again by a similar problem; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Center fielder Eric Davis, out 15 days because of a hamstring injury; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Left fielder Kal Daniels, out 40 days because of a knee injury that 
required surgery; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitcher Danny Jackson, out 18 days because of shoulder and knee injuries; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Utility outfielder Herm Winningham, out 15 days because of a hamstring 
strain; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oester, out since June 7 because of a hamstring pull; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sabo, out since June 27 because of a knee injury; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dibble, out since Monday because of elbow tendinitis; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Larkin, a .340 hitter who was put on the disabled list Friday and could 
miss two to six weeks because of an elbow injury suffered in an All-Star skills 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds were 35-24 on June 11 and seemed to be coping with the distractions 
stemming from baseball's investigation of their manager's alleged gambling 
activity. But decimated by the injuries, they fell below .500 (44-45) by losing 
the first two games of the second half to the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game the Reds were forced to start three infielders who opened the 
season in triple-A Nashville, and they blew a 3-1 lead in the seventh when 
forced to use Norm Charlton and Kent Tekulve rather than Dibble. It was only 
their second loss in 34 games they have led entering the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Rose has refused to use the injuries as an alibi. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to play the hand you're dealt," he said after Thursday's defeat, 
"but it's a tough road when you've only got 21 or 22 players and you don't have 
a backup catcher, you don't have a backup infielder and your bullpen is 
crippled. But it's going to get better, I know it." 
</P>
<P>
It could get worse, of course. Rose could lose the protection of his temporary 
restraining order against Commissioner Bart Giamatti, which would leave the 
problem of the Reds' injuries to a successor. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Guidry was the last active New York Yankee link to their last World Series 
championship in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Though still believing he could pitch effectively if given time, Guidry retired 
Wednesday with a 170-91 record, including 25-3 in '78, when he was as 
dominating as any pitcher ever. 
</P>
<P>
He had a 1.74 earned-run average that year and registered 248 strikeouts, 
including 18 against the Angels on June 18, the most overpowering performance 
this writer has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
He was truly Louisiana Lightning, but at 5-feet-11 and 160 pounds, he was more 
than that. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger second baseman Willie Randolph, who played with Guidry for 13 years, 
said: "I've always believed that Ron Guidry, pound for pound, was the fiercest 
competitor I ever played with. Nobody wanted to give him a chance when he first 
came up. Too skinny, too small, they all thought. They couldn't see what he had 
in his heart. They couldn't see the size of it. They didn't know about his 
determination. I've never seen anybody with more." 
</P>
<P>
And like Randolph, Guidry strived to ignore the often fractious atmosphere of 
the Yankee clubhouse and the meddling of the owner. His retirement, following 
that of Mike Schmidt, represents 1989's second closing of a class act. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets opened the second half with a 5-1 victory over the Atlanta 
Braves. Keith Hernandez returned to the lineup and contributed a run-scoring 
single. Darryl Strawberry and Gregg Jefferies -- they of the broken toe and 
wounded bat, respectively -- each homered. 
</P>
<P>
But if one victory represents a fresh start, the most significant aspect may 
have been the pitching performance of Ron Darling, who was 6-6 in an 
inconsistent first half but said he is determined to fill the gap created by 
Dwight Gooden's injury. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that Darling's recent divorce weighed heavily on him in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"I have tried 100% to keep my head 100% in the game," Darling said. "Whether it 
is or not, who knows? Maybe subconsciously it's (the divorce) there. 
</P>
<P>
"For whatever reason, I didn't pitch well. Now the team needs me. It's time for 
me to step to the forefront. It's my time to shine. I intend to do that, 
especially until No. 16 (Gooden) comes back." 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Rangers have had a winning record in the second half only five times 
in 17 years. A lot of it, some believe, is mental, the Rangers being unable to 
cope with the fierce Texas heat of July, August and September. 
</P>
<P>
But General Manager Tom Grieve, who has been with the club in one capacity or 
another for virtually all of those 17 years, reflected on that record and said: 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of other hot places, places like St. Louis and Kansas City, 
and it doesn't affect those teams. I think what you're dealing with is talent, 
not weather." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the meeting Tom Lasorda had with his National League pitching staff 
before the All-Star game, Chicago Cub relief ace Mitch Williams, known as the 
Wild Thing, said: 
</P>
<P>
"He asked if any of us had a trick pitch and I said, 'Yeah, I'll throw a strike 
once in a while."' 
</P>
<P>
Williams threw them often enough to help the Cubs accumulate 31 saves in the 
first half, two more than they had all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rangers are to mount a second-half threat in the American League West, 
heat isn't the only hurdle. The heart of the Texas lineup needs some help. 
Rafael Palmeiro, Julio Franco and Ruben Sierra entered the second half with a 
combined batting average of .323 with 29 homers and 174 runs batted in. The 
rest of the Rangers were hitting a combined .239 with 29 homers and only 10 
more RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
With his Minnesota Twins seemingly out of the race in the West, the second half 
clearly represents a salary drive for relief ace Jeff Reardon, who is eligible 
for free agency when the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
Reardon, who converted 42 of 50 save chances last year, was only 14 of 21 in 
the first half and may have blown a shot at the most lucrative contract he will 
be offered. 
</P>
<P>
On opening day, Reardon rejected a two-year, $3.1-million offer from the Twins, 
who then withdrew it. On the basis of his first-half performance, he will have 
trouble getting a similar offer from the Twins or anyone else, though he 
remains undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be a free agent and I have to prove something to a few people," 
he said. "That's OK, I've done it before." 
</P>
<P>
Reardon first established his credentials after being traded by the New York 
Mets to the Montreal Expos, then re-established them after being traded from 
the Expos to the Twins. He will be 34 soon, however, and has been in 60 or more 
games for seven consecutive seasons.

Picking His Spots: After losing to the Chicago Cubs Thursday, San Diego Padres 
left-hander Bruce Hurst has a 1-6 record with a 4.14 earned-run average against 
teams with winning records. He is 6-1 with a 1.75 ERA against teams with losing 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Picking Spots II: After defeating the Minnesota Twins Thursday, Boston Red Sox 
right-hander Roger Clemens has a 9-1 record against teams with losing records 
and is 1-5 against teams with winning records. 
</P>
<P>
Alone at the Top: While the Milwaukee Brewers' Rob Deer and the Kansas City 
Royals' Bo Jackson face a number of challengers in the battle for the American 
League home run title, they have turned the strikeout race into a two-man 
affair. Deer, who set the AL record with 186 in 1987, had 100 strikeouts in 317 
at-bats opening the second half. Jackson had 96 in 312 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
New Goal: Royal first baseman George Brett had a string of 13 All-Star 
appearances, the longest among active players, snapped this year, but Brett is 
looking forward to next year's game in Wrigley Field. "That's a place I've 
never played," he said. "I'd love to come back and make it." 
</P>
<P>
Schooling: Cub outfielder Jerome Walton opened the second half by going four 
for four Thursday against the Padres, but he was also picked off first, thrown 
out trying to stretch a double into a triple and thrown out attempting to steal 
home. "He can hit, he can throw and he can also run," Manager Don Zimmer said. 
"He just has to learn when." 
</P>
<P>
Cubs II: Greg Maddux has supplanted the Dodgers' Tim Leary as baseball's best 
hitting pitcher. He has hit safely in seven of his last 10 starts and is 13 for 
43 this season, a .302 average. Leary, who hit .269 last year, is two for 33, 
an .061 average. ROSS NEWHAN

STRANGE PLANS A MAJOR EFFORT TO WIN BRITISH OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andy Rivera 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Curtis Strange, who became the first golfer in nearly four decades to win 
consecutive U.S. Open championships, has his sights set on another major -- the 
British Open. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking more and more about the British Open," he said of the tournament 
that starts Thursday in Scotland. "This year I really want to do well. Last 
year I was a little overwhelmed, then shot 79 in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to it and the PGA. I have a lot better attitude. I'm more 
fired up." 
</P>
<P>
Although Strange has not won any of the other majors -- the British Open, the 
Masters, or the PGA Championship -- he does not consider it impossible to win 
more than one a year. 
</P>
<P>
"But as far as winning all four majors in a year, I don't think it is possible, 
especially when a guy can't dominate our tour," he said. "Sure, if a Jack 
Nicklaus came out, it could be possible. It was always possible when he was 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
After the British Open, Strange will team with Greg Norman in next month's 
$750,000 Fred Meyer Challenge, a charity team tournament in Portland, Ore., 
Aug. 21-22. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus, Jerry Pate, Mark Wiebe and Miller Barber are among the confirmed 
entrants in the 13th annual Jerry Ford Invitational tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-am tournament will be played July 31-Aug. 1 on two courses -- Vail Golf 
Club and the Country Club of the Rockies at Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
Among the celebrities assembled by the former President will be Bob Hope, Clint 
Eastwood, Dinah Shore, Michael Jordan, Burt Lancaster, Robert Wagner and Julius 
Erving. 
</P>
<P>
Other pros who are committed to play include Scott Hoch, defending champion 
Gary Hallberg, Andy North, Calvin Peete, Mike Reid, Dale Douglass and J.C. 
Snead. PGA commissioner Deane Beman also is scheduled to play. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Thomas, technical director of the U.S. Golf Assn., believes that 
long-shafted putters should be banned, according to the August edition of Golf 
Digest. 
</P>
<P>
USGA officials would not comment officially, but the legality of the club was 
on the agenda of the last USGA executive committee meeting, and could be 
resolved at the next meeting in August. 
</P>
<P>
The Fujitsu National Team Championship Series is about to become the largest 
amateur golf tournament in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 golf clubs around the country are holding qualifying rounds for 
this two-person, best-ball event. With these numbers, it is probable that more 
than 50,000 golfers will make it the largest event in golf history. 
</P>
<P>
Mancil Davis, current world record holder for the most holes-in-one by a 
professional, got his 49th ace in the Boy Scouts of America annual golf outing 
at Las Colinas, Tex. Davis, who posted the hole-in-one on May 31, had a 2 
1/2-year dry spell between aces, his last one coming on September 22,1986. Art 
Wall Jr. has 45. 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire Country Club pro Rick Reilly, son of American PGA President Patrick J. 
Reilly, and three of his assistants (Laurie Sneddin, Jeff Puchalski, and Ken 
White) played 166 holes over a period of 15 hours as part of the PGA's 38th 
National Golf Day charity program. 
</P>
<P>
The group collected $24,500, the largest sum raised by a single course in the 
history of the program. Pledges are made by country club members based on the 
number of holes played and birdies made during the marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia leads the point standings for the Ryder Cup Team after the 
Greater Hartford Open with a score of 742.5, followed by Curtis Strange at 
666.25. Others include Chip Beck, 643; Tom Kite, 587.5; Paul Azinger, 512.5; 
Fred Couples, 473.542; Ken Green, 465; Payne Stewart, 450; Mark McCumber, 
419.167, and Mark O'Meara, 412.5. 
</P>
<P>
Ten of the Ryder Cup Team positions are reserved for the the players with the 
most points accumulated through the 1989 PGA championships in August. The 1989 
PGA champion, if eligible, is also an automatic team member. Team captain 
Raymond Floyd will select the final member, as well as a replacement for the 
PGA champion if he is ineligible or among those in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
A celebrity tournament to benefit the "Adopt-a Senior" home delivery meal 
project will be held Friday, Aug. 4 at Griffith Park. The deadline for entry is 
July 17, with a fee of $75. 
</P>
<P>
The Optimist Junior World Golf Championship will be held at four locations in 
the San Diego area, beginning with opening ceremonies today at 4:30 p.m. Torrey 
Pines, Balboa Park, Singing Hills, and Presidio Hills will all play host to the 
tournament, which attracts more than 750 entries from 33 countries. 
</P>
<P>
Former Bruin Duffy Waldorf leads the tour in driving distance through the 
Greater Hartford Open with an average of 278.1 yards, while Lee Trevino leads 
in putting accuracy with an average of 1.714 putts per hole. Other statistical 
leaders are Tom Kite, scoring (69.46); Bruce Lietzke, greens in regulation 
(.716); Lon Hinkle, eagles (11); Fred Couples, birdies (292); and Calvin Peete, 
driving accuracy (.881).

U.S. DAVIS CUP TEAM TO KEEP FAST COMPANY WITH BECKER-LED WEST GERMANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What all started as a simple revenge match five months ago in Florida is 
getting to be serious stuff for the United States Davis Cup tennis team. No 
more beating up on 98-pound weaklings from Paraguay. No more flogging of frail 
Frenchmen. 
</P>
<P>
Nope, it's the big leagues now, the heavy hitters from West Germany. Even 
though it is only a semifinal, it has the feel of Dempsey-Firpo, the smell of 
Yankees-Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is quite a journey this U.S. team has taken -- from Hugo Chapacu to 
Boris Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Today, when Captain Tom Gorman leads his group of John McEnroe, Andre Agassi, 
Ken Flach and Robert Seguso through its first practice session at historic 
Olympia Halle in Munich, the week of hype and hope will be underway. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, in front of a sold-out arena of 11,000 fans, many of whom paid $300 a 
ticket for the three-day session, McEnroe and Agassi will play singles against 
Becker and Carl-Uwe Steeb, and the first punches in this anticipated 
best-of-five donnybrook will be thrown. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Flach and Seguso will play Becker and Eric Jelen in doubles, and 
Sunday, the reverse singles from Friday will be held. The order of the singles 
is determined in a draw Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN will televise much of the action, starting with 2 1/2 hours Friday at 6 
p.m., Pacific time, and continuing with 3 hours on Saturday, starting at 9 
a.m., and 2 1/2 hours Sunday, starting at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the United States and Gorman face a tremendous challenge. 
</P>
<P>
First, they are facing the team that won last year's Davis Cup, and did so by 
beating a Mats Wilander-Stefan Edberg team on Sweden's home court. Part of the 
charm and part of the controversy of Davis Cup tennis is that visiting teams 
win about as often as sports teams from Atlanta. So the Germans' final-round 
win in Sweden was a shocker. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the United States must play on the surface chosen by the home team. For 
this match, Nikki Pilic, West German team captain, went with a carpet-like 
surface called Pegulan. Gorman isn't happy with the choice, saying that it is a 
surface almost never played on by the pros; that a Davis Cup surface should at 
least be something vaguely familiar to the players. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for Pilic's choice of that surface is the third reason this is such 
a tough challenge for the U.S. team. That reason is named Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Becker just won his third Wimbledon title. His game has never been better, nor 
has his popularity rating in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
And his serve-and-volley game was made for fast surfaces, such as Wimbledon's 
grass and the Olympia Halle's Pegulan carpet. Pegulan reportedly is not as fast 
as grass, but it may be neck-and-neck with an ice rink. Becker's 115-m.p.h. 
serves that looked like bullets at Wimbledon may slow all the way down to 
Gretzky slap shots in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
For the U.S. team, the road to Munich started in February in Ft. Myers, Fla., 
where the Americans swept Paraguay in a match that slopped over into silliness 
in terms of revenge and patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
The United States had been out of the main draw since 1987, mostly because of a 
stunning loss in Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
That match turned when Jimmy Arias lost a controversial five-set match to an 
unheralded and relatively unskilled player named Hugo Chapacu, amid 
drum-beating and rock-throwing. So when the Paraguayans got to Florida, they 
were treated like the Indians treated Custer. 
</P>
<P>
Not only were they beaten, 5-0, winning only two sets, but the whole thing took 
on the air of some sort of nationalistic pep rally. Agassi, a bit too young to 
know any better, acted as if he were pushing the flag upright on Iwo Jima. 
</P>
<P>
In April, France came to San Diego. This time, Gorman substituted veteran 
McEnroe for little known Michael Chang, who hadn't quite reached his 17th 
birthday at the time of the Paraguay match and was deemed to be "too 
inexperienced" for quality competition. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, was before Chang won the French Open and prompted Gorman, who 
is sticking with McEnroe and Agassi for the West Germany match, to poke fun at 
himself for "probably being the only Davis Cup captain in history to leave a 
French Open champion off his team." 
</P>
<P>
Against the French -- both Yannick Noah and Henri Leconte were slowed a bit by 
injuries -- McEnroe and Agassi were spectacular, as were the ever-present Flach 
and Seguso, and the United States won again, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Next weekend's match brings to mind West Germany's 3-2 win over the U.S. team 
in Hartford, Conn., in 1987. In that match, Becker beat McEnroe in a 6-hour 
20-minute thriller and Jelen dealt the United States its death blow by 
upsetting Tim Mayotte. 
</P>
<P>
Were the United States to win this weekend, the final would be played against 
the Sweden-Yugoslavia winner Dec. 15-17 in the 21,000-seat Coliseum at 
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Germans are the apparent favorite, Gorman is talking positive and 
stressing that McEnroe is playing well and has a strong supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
"McEnroe is McEnroe," Gorman said, "and Agassi and Flach and Seguso have never 
lost a Davis Cup match." 
</P>
<P>
And Agassi adds, "If we're gonna win the Davis Cup, we've got to beat Becker 
and the Germans, and we've got to do it on whatever surface, even if it's the 
Autobahn."

KING STUMBLES, FALLS INTO TIE WITH SHEEHAN

<P>
Betsy King learned the hard way that it's impossible to coast in a major golf 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
King blew a three-stroke lead on the final two holes finished with a 
double-bogey-bogey finish Saturday, dropping her into a tie with Patty Sheehan 
in the third round of the U.S. Women's Open at Lake Orion, Mich.. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan had a two-under-par 69, while King shot a 72. They were tied at 
three-under-par 210, two shots ahead of Colleen Walker, the only other golfer 
under par. 
</P>
<P>
Marie-Laure de Lorenzi-Taya, a French citizen living in Spain, who shot a 71, 
was next at 213. 
</P>
<P>
King started four under par and got to seven under par with a birdie on the 
13th hole, before the tough Scottish-style course began to strike back. 
</P>
<P>
King, 33, began her collapse with a bogey at the 520-yard, par-five 15th hole, 
where she put her drive in the tall heather that lines Indianwood's fairways. 
</P>
<P>
On No. 17, a 188-yard, par-three, King missed her tee shot on the left side, 
left her second shot short and in the rough, then hit her third shot 10 feet 
past the hole. She two-putted from there. 
</P>
<P>
King's 150-yard second shot to the final green went 20 feet above the pin. She 
ran her first putt five feet past the hole and missed the comebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hurlbert shot a three-under-par 68 to hold off Hal Sutton for a one-stroke 
lead after three rounds of the Anheuser-Busch tournament at Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Hurlbert has a total of 14-under-par 199. Sutton, seeking his first win in 
three years, came from four strokes back with a 65. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Zembriski rode a five-birdie front nine to a five-under-par 66 and a tie 
with defending champion Orville Moody for the lead after two rounds of the 
Greater Grand Rapids Open senior tournament at Grand Rapids, Mich. Moody shot a 
70. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders were at eight-under-par 134, one stroke ahead of Dale Douglass, who 
had a 69. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Allen, who had never finished higher than fifth in three years on the 
European tour, holed shots from off the green three times in a round of 
eight-under-par 63 that lifted him to a two-stroke victory in the Scottish Open 
at Gleneagles. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, 30, a native of San Francisco who lives in Phoenix and does not play on 
the U.S. PGA Tour, had a 272 total and earned $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Woosnam of Wales and Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain tied for second place.

METAPHORS FROM ARTIFACT ART;

<P>
CRAIG STECYK USES CASTOFF SURFBOARDS TO PUNCTUATE HIS MESSAGE ABOUT HAWAIIAN 
CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Craig Stecyk is an artist who finds much of his inspiration -- not to mention 
his materials -- in society's castoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Stecyk, 39, actually accumulated discarded paintings and sculpture for 10 
years, taking them out of trash cans. In 1983, he piled them on a gallery floor 
at Claremont Graduate School and lined the walls with information cards such as 
the ones that document archeological artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
He called the exhibit "Art Trash." 
</P>
<P>
In "Fishtale," three years later, he hung car parts trophy-style in USC's 
Atelier Gallery. The parts were the spoils of what Stecyk calls "trophy hunts," 
during which he cut the fins off abandoned '50s cars and collected hubcaps from 
freeway medians. Part of that installation is on view at the Muckenthaler 
Cultural Center in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
In his newest installation, "Papa Moana" (Hawaiian for ocean board), the focus 
is on derelict wooden surfboards that Stecyk collected from trash bins while 
growing up in Santa Monica during the '50s and '60s, back when the city was the 
center of mainland surfing activity. "Papa Moana" will occupy the Laguna Art 
Museum Satellite at South Coast Plaza through Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The relic boards, now brightly painted, range from 10 to 16 feet long and would 
barely be recognizable to a modern surfer. Today's boards are usually less than 
seven feet long and are made of foam and resin. The ones in the show date from 
the 1920s and '30s, before new synthetic materials made wooden boards obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
Stecyk salvaged the boards but was not sure what to do with them until about 10 
years ago, when he thought of incorporating them in a piece that would 
symbolize the hybridization of Hawaiian culture. 
</P>
<P>
Lining corrugated-metal walls in the shopping mall's dimly lit gallery, the 
boards are adorned with various images. There is a portrait of King David 
Kalakaua, the last Hawaiian king, who, before he was deposed in 1899, 
championed the resurgence of surfing and other traditional Hawaiian activities 
suppressed by missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
Another board carries, in calligraphy, a Zen statement, "Silence like a clap of 
thunder" -- a nod to the pervasive Japanese presence in Hawaii. Still another 
board is adorned with symbols from ancient Hawaiian petroglyphs, including a 
depiction of a man surfing. Other images -- on one board, the Nazi SS symbol is 
juxtaposed with the herald of the famed 1913 Armory Show of modern art in New 
York -- may not be so easy to interpret. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a mistake to think this piece is really about surfing," Stecyk 
said during an interview in Woodland Hills, where he lives with wife, painter 
Lynn Coleman, and their two sons. 
</P>
<P>
"They're metaphorical elements as much as anything else," he said. For Stecyk, 
the Hawaiian concept of koana -- the hidden or other meaning -- plays strongly 
in the installation. The Hawaiian language, according to Stecyk, has more 
multiple meanings than any other. 
</P>
<P>
"The shades and nuances of meaning are more important than the explicit 
meaning," he said. "It's a lot like art, or what art should be like." 
</P>
<P>
One tableau, entitled "Captain Cook Memorial," is a bust of the famous 
navigator, the first Western European in the Hawaiian Islands. It is mounted 
upside down in a box pierced by spears. The gentle sound of lapping waves is 
heard -- a recording, Stecyk said, made at Kealakekua Bay on the island of 
Hawaii, where Cook was killed in 1779 during a fracas with Polynesians. 
</P>
<P>
"He was stunned by a European trade knife, fell down and drowned in knee-deep 
water, which I think is a superb metaphor," Stecyk said. "One of the greatest 
mariners of all time in any culture drowning in knee-deep water, stunned by a 
trade knife that came from his culture. . . . I think he's a superb metaphor 
for that kind of (cross-cultural) fusion." 
</P>
<P>
The installation has a false front, metal doors flanked by two tall surfboards 
(the only two that Stecyk has built from scratch). It looks like a storefront. 
The mall setting "is one of the reasons that the facade evolved," Stecyk said. 
"It's vaguely reminiscent of an old surf shop in a certain sense, but again 
it's not quite." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, with its metal walls and split-bamboo flooring, the room seems to offer 
an off-kilter vision of an officers' club at an Army post in the South Pacific 
circa 1940. Recordings of Hawaiian music from the '30s are heard intermittently 
from an old floor radio, while a neon sign alternately flashes "Aloha" and "ha" 
-- a comment on the trivialization and commercial exploitation of a word that 
signifies an entire philosophical concept to Hawaiians. 
</P>
<P>
In a darkened back room, visible only through the porthole window of a locked 
door, is a 1950 Ford station wagon; flickering images of 1920s surfing at 
Diamond Head can be seen on an old TV, propped on the tailgate. 
</P>
<P>
"You walk in, and you're really not sure if it's a shop or if it's a crypt or 
if it's a shrine," Stecyk said. "I conceived of this as kind of a cultural 
curio environment of undetermined time frame, so when you walk in there's not 
really a year to it." 
</P>
<P>
Ambiguity -- koana -- "is kind of what I'm after with most of the stuff I do, 
at least with the installations," Stecyk said. "It's exciting to have an 
environment that you walk into, and it works on a number of different levels, 
instead of just kind of a sculpture on a pedestal or a painting in a frame on a 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
"These are a little more interactive. People can go through and determine what 
kind of experience they are going to have with it." 
</P>
<P>
Those experiences have run the gamut, said Stecyk, who has visited "Papa Moana" 
several times since its June 30 installation. "Some people have sort of violent 
attitudes about it," he said. "They say, 'Well, if this is art, I've got a 
whole garage full of art.' Which is a great statement." 
</P>
<P>
Another Hawaiian concept figures into "Papa Moana." It is mana, a person's 
spiritual essence that can be passed onto the person's possessions. While 
Stecyk often uses discarded objects in his works as a comment on society's 
wastefulness, the old surfboards are precious because of their past. 
</P>
<P>
"The prior history of the boards was important because they actually did have 
mana. They had been owned by people," the artist said. "Some of them had been 
owned by some fairly influential people," such as Tom Blake and Pete Peterson, 
who were instrumental in the popularization of surfing in the '20s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
Blake was the first to commercially produce a composite surfboard, with a 
then-high-tech material: plywood. Stecyk called Blake's board "the bridge point 
between past and future," between Hawaiian and mainland culture. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota native Blake was also the first haole (outsider) to win a surfing 
championship in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"These men were still active when I grew up," Stecyk said. Pictures of Blake 
and Peterson hang in "Papa Moana," alongside a photo of Duke Kahanamoku, the 
"father of modern surfing," a champion swimmer who rescued surfing from 
cultural oblivion and helped popularize it as a sport. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in Santa Monica, Stecyk had started bodysurfing and rafting by age 
6, surfing by age 10. He was also heavily influenced by the custom-car 
movement: His father was a partner of George Barris, the best-known of the 
customizers of the '50s and '60s. A third influence was art. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up around artists. My parents were involved with ceramics and 
photography and whatnot, and all of our neighbors were artists, and a lot of my 
parents' friends were artists," Stecyk said. "There was just a long pattern of 
involvement with art. It was kind of expected that you did that -- it was kind 
of expected that you have kind of a broad-based cultural approach to things." 
</P>
<P>
Also influenced by local gangs, Stecyk at age 15 adopted graffiti as his first 
art ventures. "I never thought of graffiti as vandalism," he said. "I always 
thought of (graffiti) as an art form." 
</P>
<P>
Designs adapted from gangs' insignia became a personal code that first graced 
his surfboards and soon graced buildings and other structures. His efforts were 
documented in several non-art publications, including Surfer and Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Later extensions of the graffiti were his "street rods," cast aluminum rods 
that were anonymously bolted to the ground in unauthorized locations, and 
painted metal plaques that were surreptitiously attached to buildings. 
</P>
<P>
This guerrilla approach to art has continued, in various forms, into this 
decade. A few years back, he would travel with a portable foundry looking for 
road kills. He would skin the animals killed by cars, make an impression in 
bronze of the innards, epoxy it to the road and reattach the skin. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, as part of a work called "Deep Six," he sank six bronze female torsos 
at unrecorded locations in Santa Monica Bay. Partly inspired by underwater 
archeological finds and also making a comment on the commercialization of art 
(by destroying his product), Stecyk called the process "reverse 
historification." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica has changed, but Stecyk, who maintains a studio in Ocean Park, 
still traces his work to his early environment. "In a certain sense, I guess 
what I do is partly autobiographical," he said. "There was always a feeling of 
heritage, no matter what your activity was, in Santa Monica. It was next to Los 
Angeles, but it was on the ocean, and you were very aware that you were 
different. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I never made a conscious decision to do things. It's just that the things I 
was doing were identified as art. Growing up in Santa Monica, there was always 
a feeling that there was an indigenous life style and perhaps, I would argue, 
an indigenous aesthetic." 
</P>

Twenty years. A blink of time in the universe but a fourth of a lifetime for

Buzz Aldrin, 59, sits at a desk in his Laguna Beach home, windows opening on a 
stunning view of the Emerald Bay coast of the Pacific Ocean. To his right, a 
wall of pictures and artwork document his career as an Air Force officer and 
astronaut.

"July 16 will be the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch," Aldrin said. 
"I'll be there, at the Cape, at the exact time of liftoff, to mark that

Four days later, Aldrin will be in Washington. In the company of Neil Armstrong 
and Michael Collins, Aldrin will stand with President Bush at the Smithsonian 
Institution. Along with the rest of the world, they will recall the great 
adventure: the day Armstrong became the first man to step on the moon, and 
Aldrin, 18 minutes later, the second, while Collins soared in lunar orbit above 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years after the moonwalk, Aldrin is clear-eyed, robust, physically fit. 
But he is clearly an angry man -- an explorer who is enraged at his country for 
failing to advance beyond the moon. Indeed, he is angry that the United States 
seems to have abandoned the moon itself. 
</P>
<P>
"America won the first moon race," Aldrin wrote in his new book, "Men from 
Earth." "But it is possible we will become a second-rate space power in the 
next century." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Aldrin repeatedly hit on the theme of America's squandering of 
the potential of the moon. It can serve as the U.S. launching pad to Mars, he 
said. The moon can provide "an ample supply of the isotope helium-3" to fuel 
nuclear fusion reactors that "would be almost completely devoid of 
radioactivity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The moon, Aldrin said, could also be used to collect solar energy and beam it 
earthward -- a cheap, renewable source of power. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrin's blue eyes flash. He jabs a finger at the interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
"We went six years without even flying one American into orbit, while the 
Soviets continued to perfect Soyuz I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and then (the 
space station) Mir," Aldrin said. "And we still haven't put an operating 
location in space." 
</P>
<P>
There is already a great, logical place for the United States to build a 
permanent, human-staffed space station, he said. "It's called the moon." 
</P>
<P>
America needs a thriving, active base on the moon, he said. "Initially, we need 
to build up, to set out, the facilities that then can serve man (on Earth) with 
lunar resources," Aldrin said. "We need information from telescopes to be 
placed on the far side of the moon. We need transmission bases and manned 
scientific investigations just like when they put people in Antarctica. We 
don't just put machines in Antarctica to send back lots of information. We put 
people down there." 
</P>
<P>
When Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin blasted off from Cape Kennedy (now Cape 
Canaveral) in Florida, Aldrin was generally described as the threesome's most 
accomplished scientist. An intense, driven man, he speaks tersely, using few 
adjectives. When he stepped onto the moon's surface 20 years ago, however, he 
was moved to say: "Beautiful! beautiful! Magnificent desolation." Later, Aldrin 
unfurled an American flag, planted the staff into the tough lunar surface and 
then gave the Stars and Stripes a snappy West Point salute. An estimated 500 
million people around the world watched television coverage of the historic 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, Aldrin said his most nervous moments came during the flag 
ceremony. "I suddenly felt stage fright," he wrote. "Since childhood, I'd been 
fascinated by explorers planting flags on strange shores. Now I was about to do 
the same thing, but on the most exotic shore mankind had ever reached." 
</P>
<P>
Before stepping onto the lunar surface, Aldrin performed a private religious 
ceremony inside the module. Using a small Communion kit given him by his 
Presbyterian pastor, Aldrin conducted a remembrance of Christ's Last Supper. "I 
gave thanks," Aldrin wrote in his book. 
</P>
<P>
Life has brought hard landings for the former astronaut since his historic 
moonwalk. Aldrin, who bought a condominium and moved to Orange County about 5 
1/2 years ago, had divorced twice before he met and married Lois Driggs Aldrin 
and moved to her Emerald Bay home. He has battled depression and overcome an 
addiction to alcohol. Aldrin has also encountered career frustration. Instead 
of another space job after Apollo 11, Aldrin was assigned to command the test 
flight school at Edwards Air Force Base, north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I went back to the Air Force and tried to find a home there," Aldrin said. "It 
was a challenging assignment, but inappropriate really for me to command a test 
pilot school. I'd never had any formal training in test piloting. Also, I'd 
been away from the military 11 years -- 3 1/2 years while getting my doctor's 
degree at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and 7 1/2 years at NASA 
(National Aeronautics and Space Administration). A much better assignment would 
have been at the Air Force Academy, as commandant of cadets. But they (in the 
Air Force) had other ideas in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrin was born in Montclair, N.J., and christened Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. He 
legally changed his name to Buzz, his lifelong nickname, about 10 years ago. 
The nickname was his older sister's fuzzy way of calling him "baby brother." 
</P>
<P>
He graduated in 1951 from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, third in his 
class. Aldrin was a fighter pilot during the Korean War and credited with 
shooting down two MIG-15 jets. After earning his doctorate from MIT, for which 
he wrote on orbital rendezvous techniques in space, he was tapped for the 
astronaut program in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his long years in the military, Aldrin now speaks acidly of the Air 
Force. "I've seen that the Air Force really doesn't know how to treat space 
people," he said. "They don't look after their promotions, their livelihood, 
anywhere near the way the Navy does." 
</P>
<P>
He retired with the rank of colonel in March, 1972. By then, Aldrin was 
experiencing periods of depression, which he candidly discussed in his first 
book, "Return to Earth." 
</P>
<P>
Now, years later, as he sits at his home in Laguna Beach, Aldrin says 
alcoholism was at the root of the depression. 
</P>
<P>
"The last person to be aware of the seriousness and progression of the disease 
of alcoholism is the person who's got it," Aldrin said. "So I was unable to 
really come to grips (with) what was troubling me at the time. And it was not 
depression or anxiety or nervousness. It was inherited, genetic traits (toward 
alcoholism) that I just fostered and encouraged, and thank God, the trauma of 
being put on a pedestal, and trying to live up to that, accelerated the 
progression (of the disease) so that I had a chance, before I was too old, to 
go through a recovery process. So all of that brought about this kind of 
turnaround and forced me to make that kind of recovery in '75 and '76. I had 
three years of stumbling around, but now it's 10 1/2 years" of continuous 
sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell it more simply," his wife, Lois, said. "What would you do at the 
age of 40, if you'd worked for this fantastic career where you reached the top? 
You'd want to go on! But what if you found suddenly that you couldn't go on in 
that career -- that your progress and your ideas in life were stopped? So who 
wouldn't get depressed?" 
</P>
<P>
America has made poor use of its former astronauts, Aldrin said. "I don't think 
we've done very well as far as establishing a rapport between all former 
astronauts on an annual basis," he said. "We haven't got a unity. We're taken 
advantage of because of that. We've played one against the other. We don't get 
the privileges that I think our status deserves, and it's because we're not 
unified. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I really know an awful lot about what we ought to do in the future 
in space," he said. "But I'm not consulted when decisions are made. I think I 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrin's permanent status as the second man to walk on the moon has led to 
endless interview questions and a suggestion in his book that he was 
dissatisfied with the decision. But Aldrin pointed out in the interview that 
Armstrong was both commander of the lunar expedition and had seniority because 
he was picked earlier for training as an astronaut. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have a hard time explaining why the junior member of the third group (of 
astronauts), the co-pilot, was given the privilege of saying the historic words 
of first putting his foot on the moon and then looking back and seeing my 
commander in the lunar module waiting his turn to come down to the surface," 
Aldrin said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is not bitter. "Why should I be? But how do I deny being bitter 
about it? How the hell can you answer that one except by saying, 'Listen, 
honestly, I'm a military man, I understand seniority.' " 
</P>
<P>
Aldrin, an international space consultant and lecturer since his military 
retirement, is now finding life good. He likes living in Orange County because 
"it's got growth and tremendous opportunity." He also enjoys being near the 
tranquility of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
His three grown children -- a daughter and two sons -- visit frequently.

ORANGE COUNTY GAVE A BIG PUSH IN DRIVE TO REACH THE MOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS and THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the early-morning darkness of a spring day in 1969, a convoy carrying a 
strange-looking cargo pulled out of a Rockwell International facility and 
snaked its way along Seal Beach Boulevard to the nearby Navy dock. 
</P>
<P>
The trucks and trailers were transporting a large section of the huge Saturn V 
rocket that would take man to the moon -- and back to Earth -- for the first 
time ever. 
</P>
<P>
The booster rocket, placed on its side aboard a specially built transporter, 
was so large that power lines had to be lifted and street lights twisted out of 
the way to allow the convoy to pass. It was then loaded onto a barge at the 
Navy dock for a long journey to the launch pad at Cape Kennedy (now Cape 
Canaveral), Fla. 
</P>
<P>
On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft lifted off with astronauts Neil A. 
Armstrong, Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. and Michael Collins aboard, and on July 
20, 1969, Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a role in something as important, as elegant and as challenging as 
putting a man on the moon was very satisfying," said William Dean, 59, who 
supervised the engineers and technicians who worked around the clock to perfect 
Rockwell's portion of the spacecraft. "We knew we were part of something that 
would be recorded in history as a milestone as important as almost anything 
that had happened in mankind." 
</P>
<P>
Dean was just one of thousands of Orange County workers who helped put the 
first men on the moon. At a time when "Midnight Cowboy" was playing on local 
movie screens and "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In" was perched atop the TV 
ratings, county aerospace workers were designing and building some of the key 
hardware for Apollo 11's half-million-mile journey to the moon. The Orange 
County operations of Rockwell, McDonnell Douglas and TRW Inc. performed major 
work on Apollo 11, and dozens of smaller local subcontractors made 
contributions too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Stages 
</P>
<P>
Because no single rocket was powerful enough to carry a spacecraft to the moon 
by itself, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration devised a plan for 
three rockets, or stages, that would be strapped together. Each stage would be 
discarded after it performed its task. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell plants in Seal Beach and Downey built Saturn V's second-stage rocket, 
which would propel the craft to an altitude of 103 nautical miles, then be 
jettisoned so that the third stage could take over. (The first-stage rocket 
would launch Apollo 11, then quickly fall away.) Rockwell also built monitoring 
and control systems for the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
The third-stage rocket was built by McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach. That 
rocket would bring the spacecraft into an orbit around the Earth, then fire its 
engines again to propel the craft toward the moon. 
</P>
<P>
The TRW San Juan Capistrano plant developed the engines used to lower the 
landing module to the surface of the moon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exciting Time 
</P>
<P>
The men and women who were part of the Apollo space program remember it as a 
time of hard work and extraordinary challenge, and they recalled the excitement 
of participating in what perhaps would be the most daring exploration ever 
undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, everyone was so busy and spirits were so high that it was 
really a wonderful place to work," said George V. Butler, an executive in 
McDonnell Douglas's space division in Huntington Beach during the Apollo 
program. "Those were some of the best years." 
</P>
<P>
President John F. Kennedy had issued the challenge to the nation in 1961: Land 
a man on the moon before the end of the decade. Indeed, in a speech to Congress 
in May of that year, Kennedy said of the mission, "No single space project in 
this period will be more exciting or more impressive to mankind or more 
important for the long-range exploration of space, and none will be so 
difficult or so expensive to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
The Apollo 11 mission marked the climax of an unprecedented nine-year effort to 
take man to the moon and back -- and to do it before the Soviet Union did. 
Although the previous Apollo missions had tested many of the technologies used 
in Apollo 11, landing a spacecraft on the moon and bringing it back would be a 
venture into uncharted territory. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knew what the surface of the moon was like," said Butler, now executive 
director of the McDonnell Douglas space station division in Huntington Beach. 
"We didn't know if Armstrong was going to sink to his knees or what." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Feeling of Importance' 
</P>
<P>
The TRW plant was charged with testing the engines used on the Eagle, the lunar 
module that would take Armstrong and Aldrin from the command module to the 
lunar surface. Those engines would play a critical role, performing as both 
brake and booster for the lunar module, and they had to allow Armstrong and 
Aldrin to change the direction of the module in case they needed to change 
landing sites at the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
"There was always that feeling of importance," said Benjamin Cruz, a 
33-year-old supervisor on the TRW program in 1969. "We knew we could do it. We 
were pushing the technological edge forward. Our reputation was at stake. I 
don't think there were doubts it could be done, but it was not an easy thing to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, TRW did its job well. Just as Armstrong and Aldrin were 
preparing to land on the moon, they saw that the intended landing site in the 
Sea of Tranquility was not the clear plain NASA planners had thought. Rather, 
it was a treacherous field covered with boulders the size of automobiles. The 
effort to land would provide some of the most tense moments of the mission. 
</P>
<P>
The TRW engines performed flawlessly, enabling Armstrong to take manual control 
of the Eagle and steer the spindly looking module into a safer area four miles 
west of the intended site -- and with less than 10 seconds' worth of fuel left. 
</P>
<P>
"Houston, Tranquility Base here," Armstrong reported back to NASA mission 
control in Houston after the 47-minute descent. "The Eagle has landed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cigars Passed Around 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas' Butler was watching at mission control in Houston as the 
Eagle set down on the powdery lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very tense and exciting time," said Butler, who recalled how he 
became anxious himself as the Eagle's fuel ran low and as Armstrong and Aldrin 
"seemed to take forever" to put on the spacesuits they would wear for the 
moonwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Those breathless moments turned into sighs of relief and shouts of jubilation 
as Armstrong placed his left boot on the moon's surface, did not sink, and 
uttered the words, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for 
mankind." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone got out cigars and puffed on them, including me," Butler recalled. "I 
sort of turned green, not being a cigar smoker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goose-Bump Time 
</P>
<P>
David A. Forge, 55, a test engineer for McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach 
on the Apollo program, recalled watching the moonwalk at home with his wife, 
Delores. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember sitting there with the biggest goose bumps I've ever had in my life 
and watching the tears running down my wife's cheeks," Forge said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an extremely hectic time, and we usually worked around the clock, six 
or seven days a week," said Robert G. Minor, then an engineering manager for 
the Apollo program and now president of Rockwell's space division in Downey. 
"But it was a very high-spirited time because this was a high-visibility 
program with lots of public support." 
</P>
<P>
The walk itself marked "a great day" for the nation, Minor said. "I look back 
at that as the pinnacle of when the United States was at the top of the 
technological tree. I don't think anybody on Earth compared to us. Obviously, a 
lot has happened since then." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the attention generated by the mission, Cruz said he and his fellow 
workers were too busy doing their jobs to fully comprehend the significance of 
it all at the time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Perspective 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't stand back and look at it like the nation did," Cruz said. "The 
realization comes after. Then we said, 'My gosh, look what we did.' " 
</P>
<P>
The lunar lander, after returning Armstrong and Aldrin to the orbiting command 
module piloted by Collins, was discarded, crashing into the moon's surface, 
where it will remain forever. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz cherishes the thought that he will be able to tell his 3-year-old 
granddaughter that a piece of his work will stay on the moon forever after. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Apollo program provided exciting and challenging work, its demands 
sometimes took a toll on family life. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us who worked on the Apollo program went through a lot of conscience 
problems associated with our responsibilities to our families and jobs," said 
Dean, the former Rockwell manager who today is president of a Silicon Valley 
aerospace firm. "We knew that our jobs were going to make the difference 
between the crew surviving a trip to the moon and getting back safely. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that was part of the reason why I hauled my children out to the TV to 
watch the moon landing," Dean said. "I wanted them to understand, in some 
fashion, that my absence had counted for something."

COUNTY LIKELY TO LEGITIMIZE DEVELOPER LYON'S COTO DE CAZA COPTER LANDING SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Lyon is not your typical commuter. For months, the eminent developer 
has ferried himself and passengers in and out of his sprawling Coto de Caza 
estate by helicopter, departing from what is Orange County's only residential 
helipad. 
</P>
<P>
This week, about a year after Lyon began the flights, the Orange County Board 
of Supervisors is expected to give him permission to land. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that Lyon, former chairman of Air Cal, built the heliport on his 
sprawling 130-plus acre homestead without getting the required local and state 
permits, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say it's illegal, but it was done without the benefit of the proper 
permits," said Dan Fricke, a county planner. 
</P>
<P>
When the supervisors take up the matter on Tuesday, they will consider granting 
after-the-fact permission for the helipad. County officials expect the matter, 
listed as a routine consent calendar item, to sail through without a hitch, 
setting the stage for Lyon to get final approval from the state, probably this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retired Air Force General 
</P>
<P>
An active pilot, retired Air Force Reserve brigadier general, big-game hunter, 
collector of classic autos, Republican Party contributor and noted 
philanthropist, Lyon declined through his secretary to talk about the heliport. 
</P>
<P>
A background report prepared by the county, however, shed some light on the 
heliport. It consists of a grass surface supported by subterranean concrete 
blocks. The report says that "flush mounted (upward directed) perimeter 
lighting is proposed to facilitate night operations." 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the planning division, says Lyon's Bell Long Ranger 
helicopter will be based at John Wayne Airport and "will operate on a flight 
path remaining south of the San Diego Freeway to El Toro Road and then to Coto 
de Caza," flying at about 1,500 feet. It says Lyon would probably use the 
helicopter an average of three to a maximum of five round trips per week. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lyon agreed to open the facility to Coto de Caza residents in the 
event of earthquake, fire or "other similar acts of nature," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach consultant hired by Lyon to get the permits said the former 
Air Cal chief simply was unaware that the permits were needed when he built the 
landing pad at his Coto de Caza home. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he was initially aware there were requirements for it," said 
Jeff Wright, owner of Heliplanners, a one-man outfit which shepherds helipad 
proposals through the permit process. "When he learned that there were, he had 
his firm contact us to go ahead and get permits and make it nice and legal." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Riesen, airports chief with the state division of aeronautics, said such 
scenarios are not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the major problems is most people don't realize there's a state law for 
private heliports," Riesen said. "It's ignorance on their part. Once we notify 
them and explain the law, we work with them to get these things legalized." 
</P>
<P>
Though the state has the final say in permitting heliports, he said, few 
safeguards exist to prevent someone from plunking down a back-yard landing pad 
-- as long as neighbors don't complain. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enough people to police it," Riesen said. "When we find one, we 
notify local government officials and they have the responsibility for 
enforcing the law. As a last resort, we can go to court and get a restraining 
order to shut a heliport down, but that doesn't happen very often." 
</P>
<P>
Lyon's neighbors hardly seem to mind the flights into his helipad. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who would complain about it would complain about a car going down the 
street backfiring," said Dave Chase, who lives a half mile up the road. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Todd, a neighbor just across the street from Lyon's property, said the 
developer has made a concerted effort to avoid flying over neighbors' homes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is America; the guy's succeeded in life and he should have a chance to 
enjoy it," Todd said. "My concern is with these other helicopter pilots who 
bring people up to look at real estate and end up hovering right over the 
fairway." 
</P>
<P>
Wright said Lyon's six-passenger helicopter usually is parked at a corporate 
heliport at John Wayne Airport, then flown to the Coto de Caza estate to pick 
him up. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the choice of sitting on the freeway for two hours, or getting to work 
in a few minutes by helicopter, if I had the money, I'd go by helicopter," 
Wright said.

Looking Back -- In honor of the 20th anniversary of the first manned moon 
landing, the Museum of Natural History and Science in Newport Beach will offer 
a 45-minute presentation on NASA's first 25 years at 1 p.m. Saturday. The 
program will include slides and videotapes on the projects Mercury, Gemini, 
Apollo, Skylab and the space shuttle, and will be presented by Steve Lattanzio 
of Orange Coast College. Museum admission for non-members is $2 for adults, $1 
for students and seniors. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is also offering an Aug. 5 field trip to an observatory owned by 
Orange County astronomers, near Anza in San Diego County. Participants will see 
the crescent moon, Saturn and several other planets, star clusters, nebulae and 
galaxies. Transportation is not provided. Fees are $5 per person, $4 for 
students.

KINDNESS WAS ON DISPLAY AT YARD SALE FOR POOL VICTIM, 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When the loss is great enough and it seems the happiness of yesterday is 
overshadowed by the uncertainty of the future, Christy Kolbet will tell you 
that there is refuge in the kindness of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
There were the two children who dropped off their favorite toys, the toddler in 
the red jumpsuit who put a nickel in the donation box and the anonymous young 
man who stopped by just long enough to add his $5. 
</P>
<P>
These people didn't know Kolbet or her son, Jonathan Weston, yet that didn't 
seem to matter. They came Saturday to Kolbet's Tustin house, joining hundreds 
of others at a yard sale to help pay 2-year-old Jonathan's mounting medical 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been so nice, so kind," said Kolbet, 39. "People we didn't even 
know have helped. It's such a wonderful thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home in Foothills 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan was 23 months old on March 30 when he and two other toddlers wandered 
into a back-yard swimming pool at an unlicensed day-care home in Tustin. One 
child died, while Jonathan and Melissa Dianne Polsfoot, 20 months, both 
suffered severe brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
The operator of the day-care home, Diane Brooks, and her 24-year-old daughter 
were charged with failing to obtain a family day-care license, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the toddlers apparently managed to open a gate in a fence 
that separated a play area from a star-shaped swimming pool behind the family's 
ranch-style home in the Tustin foothills. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan is hospitalized at Western Neuro Care Center in Tustin, undergoing 
daily physical therapy while his mother and father, Derek Weston, 28, keep a 
vigil at his bedside. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not moving," Weston said of his son. "All he does is open his eyes. The 
doctors aren't giving us much hope that he'll ever be able to walk or talk 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Weston, a carpenter, said life since the accident has been a blur of "working 
and spending time at the hospital. I get up at 5 in the morning and I get off 
at 5 in the afternoon. Then I go to the hospital. Every day. We come home and I 
start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
Kolbet, who is on leave from her job with Allergan Pharmaceuticals in Irvine, 
said she spends an average of 10 hours a day at her son's bedside, hoping for a 
miracle. 
</P>
<P>
"He moves his eyes and he looks at me," she said. "I know he recognizes me. At 
least I think he does. We can't lose hope. We're not going to abandon our 
child. We're not going to give up on him." 
</P>
<P>
Therapists are working with Jonathan's legs, massaging his muscles and trying 
to teach him to swallow again. The hope, Kolbet said, is that her son will 
improve enough so that he can come home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm learning a lot through all this," she said. "A lot about therapy and how 
to handle all this." 
</P>
<P>
The accident has also taken its toll emotionally. Weston and his wife attend 
regular meetings of POND (Parents of Near Drowners), a support group, and they 
also undergo professional counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"We sought help because we want to make it," Kolbet said. "We want to get 
through this. Our mental health is important in helping Jonathan." 
</P>
<P>
Neither will speak about what happened at the day-care home and they are 
reluctant to sound bitter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say anything about that right now," Kolbet said. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate goal is to provide the best care possible for their son and try 
to deal with medical bills that have already surpassed $200,000. At this rate, 
Kolbet said, her maximum $1-million catastrophic health-care policy will be 
eaten up within a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone has any idea about what catastrophic health care costs," 
she said. "You think $1-million coverage is a lot, and it isn't. After the 
insurance runs out, what do we do then?" 
</P>
<P>
The yard sale was a start, with friends, neighbors and strangers pitching in to 
bring items to the house to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"Things just keep coming in," Kolbet said. "People are really trying to help 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Some people came by to buy clothes or books or some of the other items 
scattered across the front lawn, while others simply dropped coins or bills in 
a donation box and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want the best for my son," Kolbet said, "because we can't lose hope. We 
want the best care, the best therapists. He deserves that." 
</P>
<P>
Family friends said a fund in Jonathan's name had been established and that 
donations can be sent to the Jonathan Weston Account, World Savings, 18351 
Irvine Blvd., Tustin, Calif. 92680.

KRAFT LAWYERS TO ENTER NEXT PHASE FIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His family adores him. Close friends support him. Former co-workers boast he 
was personable, bright, a hard worker. But the question for Randy Steven Kraft 
is whether their testimony, if it happens, will be enough to spare him from a 
death verdict. 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old computer consultant, convicted by a jury two months ago of 16 
Orange County murders, returns to Superior Court in Santa Ana on Monday as his 
attorneys begin their case in the penalty phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claim Kraft may be the most prolific serial killer in the country, 
responsible for at least 45 murders in three states over 11 years. But for 
Kraft's death penalty hearing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown has chosen to 
introduce just eight slayings in addition to the 16 murders in the conviction. 
Those occurred in Oregon and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's lawyers acknowledge that the jurors will begin their penalty 
deliberations convinced that Kraft killed 24 people. Their efforts in the next 
few weeks, they have said, will focus on Kraft's background and character -- 
not a defense of the eight out-of-state slayings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try like hell to save his life," said Kraft lawyer C. Thomas 
McDonald. "But no, it's not going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, who had lived a quiet life style in Long Beach's gay community, was 
arrested May 14, 1983. Two California Highway Patrol officers had stopped him 
for a traffic violation on the San Diego Freeway at 1 a.m. and found a dead 
Marine in the front passenger seat of his car. 
</P>
<P>
Though Kraft has claimed his innocence in all the killings, he has not 
testified. And much of the evidence against him was left unexplained, such as 
color pictures of some victims, obviously dead or unconscious, found in his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
But many people after the Kraft trial have speculated that the defense lawyers, 
knowing Kraft would be convicted, have invested much of their time preparing to 
fight the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers have kept their plan a closely guarded secret. Superior Court Judge 
Donald A. McCartin gave Kraft's lawyers more than a month to complete their 
preparations after prosecutors completed their penalty case. 
</P>
<P>
"Will we see a lot of Randy's friends, or will it be the shrinks?" one law 
enforcement official said, wondering whether Kraft's lawyers will rely on 
psychiatrists to explain their client to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
If Kraft's lawyers argue to jurors, with help from psychiatric testimony, that 
Kraft didn't know what he was doing, or couldn't help himself, the problem they 
face is Kraft's claims of innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"How can his lawyers argue he has such a twisted mind he shouldn't be sent to 
the gas chamber, when their position in the trial has been that Kraft has never 
killed anyone?" a defense lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft has not testified. His lawyers decided against it after McCartin refused 
to guarantee them he would limit cross-examination by Brown. 
</P>
<P>
But the question arises again. If Kraft takes the stand and continues to claim 
his innocence, he could open the door for Brown to ask him about dozens of 
other slayings the jurors have never heard about. 
</P>
<P>
The defense also might keep Kraft off the stand if they are convinced their 
only real chance to save him is through appeal. The defense claims Kraft has 
not had a fair trial because the judge should have separated the case into 
several trials. 
</P>
<P>
"Put anyone on trial for 16 murders, and the jurors will inherently believe he 
must be guilty," Kraft lawyer James G. Merwin has said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Mate' Ready to Testify 
</P>
<P>
Another question is whether jurors will hear from Kraft's former "mate" as they 
referred to each other -- Jeff Selig, who has not testified to date. But Selig 
reportedly is still friends with Kraft, and is ready to testify on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
While Kraft's lawyers have adopted the public posture that their client is 
innocent, they have tried to learn more about what makes a person become a 
serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
They have reportedly hired as a consultant James Alan Fox, a Northeastern 
University associate professor in criminal justice, who has written extensively 
about serial killings. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent book he co-wrote with another Northeastern professor, Jack Levin, 
they said that "in most respects (serial killers) are extraordinarily 
ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
"Many mass killers are otherwise law-abiding citizens who belong to the local 
church, pay their taxes, attend ballgames, play with their children and 
complain about corruption in high places." 
</P>
<P>
They also wrote in their book, "Mass Murder (America's Growing Menace)," that 
"public support for the execution of mass murderers is now overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Support From Kin 
</P>
<P>
But McDonald and Merwin say they are going into the next phase of the trial 
fighting. And Kraft will no doubt have strong support from his three sisters, 
his brothers-in-law and nieces, and his parents. Most of them have already 
attended portions of his trial, and in guarded statements, have said they 
believe he is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
After Kraft's conviction, one of his sisters, Kay Plunkett, cautioned 
reporters: "It's not over yet." 
</P>
<P>
But Kraft's lawyers already know what prosecutor Brown's closing argument is 
going to say. He will surely remind jurors of their own words. 
</P>
<P>
During jury selection, each of the 10 women and two men on the jury said that 
they could vote for a death verdict if a defendant's crimes were serious 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
Said one defense lawyer after the case: "Brown will tell those jurors that if 
they can't send someone to the gas chamber who has killed 24 people for his own 
pleasure, for whom would they be saving it?"

RATS, MICE STEAL SPOTLIGHT AS FAIR HITS HIGH GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rats -- the latest, hippest designer pet? For most everyone ogling the 
specimens as they lolled about their cages at the Orange County Fair on 
Saturday, the thought didn't come easy. 
</P>
<P>
But if you believe the American Fancy Rat and Mouse Assn., rats are easy to 
keep, don't require too much room and -- here we'll quote -- "provide all the 
pleasure of a warm, cuddly, intelligent and friendly pet companion." 
</P>
<P>
Not many people said they were convinced, but the rat and mouse exhibit was one 
of the more popular attractions as the 97th edition of the fair swung into the 
weekend in high gear. 
</P>
<P>
With balloons bobbing, flags waving and amusement rides spinning in the 
background, there were crowds at just about every booth and exhibit on what 
fair officials called a picture-perfect fair day. 
</P>
<P>
Early indications are that attendance is up this year, while arrests are down, 
fair officials said. By 3 p.m. Saturday, nearly 25,000 people had passed 
through the turnstiles, up from 19,800 at the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Record Day Friday 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, 52,625 people attended the fair, a record for the first Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, there were 18 arrests, all alcohol-related, down from 24 
arrests the previous year, fair spokeswoman Diane Sorensen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has been running extremely smoothly and we haven't had any major 
problems at all," she added. 
</P>
<P>
In the rabbit and poultry tent, 6-year-old Betsy Baker eyed a litter of 10 
newborn mice and admitted the pink little critters were kind of cute. 
</P>
<P>
Her reaction to an equally pink, large hairless mouse that appeared to be 
asleep in a cage echoed that of others, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, how disgusting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Hauser, founder of the Fancy Rat and Mouse Assn., has heard that and 
worse about the creatures she calls lovable companions. 
</P>
<P>
Hauser, 29, of Riverside, formed the rat group about six years ago because 
"people were interested knowing how to raise them." 
</P>
<P>
"There are shows and clubs for other animals so why not rats and mice?" she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The group now has about 180 members around the country and overseas who raise 
rats and mice for show. 
</P>
<P>
Aware of the less-than-favorable light in which her pets of choice are held, 
she is also out to erase some misconceptions and outright lies. 
</P>
<P>
First, there is a vast difference between wild rats ("some of the worst pests 
of mankind") and the domesticated rats and mice used for breeding and show. One 
is not advised to go slopping around some sewer to find a rat for a pet, Hauser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, rats and mice are far from the dirty, disease-ridden creatures that 
most people envision. In fact, they are quite healthy and usually live from two 
to three years. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people think that rats were plague-carriers, but it is not rats but the 
fleas that carry disease, and they could be on people and other animals as well 
as rats," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, rats and mice are extremely intelligent, much more so than your 
average pig or chicken. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Know Their Names 
</P>
<P>
Rats and mice respond to their names (Hauser's are called Bandit, Bandido, 
Pundit and Pepper) and can be taught to come when you call them and other neat 
tricks, Hauser swears. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth, rats and mice are not the boring, bland cut-from-the-same cookie-cutter 
little creatures that one would think. 
</P>
<P>
There are two varieties -- short, smooth glossy hair or curly hair and whiskers 
-- and 21 distinct colors recognized among rat aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
They include beige and black of course, but also champagne, amber, mink, 
cinnamon, pearl, fawn and lilac. 
</P>
<P>
So, if one must have a burrowing animal for a pet, what's wrong with a hamster? 
Get serious, Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamsters don't like to interact with people and won't come out and play with 
you and they are not good mothers and are notorious biters, Hauser said. 
Besides, they are much less sturdy than rats and mice if you want to hug or 
cuddle them. 
</P>
<P>
Kelle Steward of Huntington Beach, also a member of the rat group, says she can 
attest to all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
She said she owns "four or five or six" rats or mice or whatever and they make 
wonderful pets. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had just about every other kind of animal you can imagine," she said as 
she fielded questions from curious onlookers. "And these are about the only 
ones that don't bark or bite."

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY WILL BE WELL REPRESENTED IN OKLAHOMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Olympic Festival this week at Oklahoma City will provide different 
opportunities for the 75 or so Orange County athletes who will participate. 
</P>
<P>
For athletes such as 1988 Olympic shotputters Jim Doehring and Bonnie Dasse and 
Peter Campbell, a two-time Olympic water polo player, the Olympic Festival 
represents a chance to get together with friends -- and rivals -- while 
competing largely free of high stakes and pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are talented athletes such as recent Mater Dei High School graduate 
Tony Pena, an all-county baseball selection this year with a pitching record of 
12-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Festival will offer Pena, like most of the younger athletes, 
valuable experience in national-class competition. In many ways, the Olympic 
Festival is a steppingstone to bigger and better competitions, namely the 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Festival officially opens Friday with ceremonies at the University 
of Oklahoma's Owen Field in Norman. Swimming events, however, begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven medal sports -- from athletics (track and field) to yachting -- 
will be contested. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes are grouped into one of four teams: North, South, East or West. Most 
of the sports, including track and field, base team designation on the region 
in which the athlete attended his or her senior year of high school. 
</P>
<P>
Other sports, such as volleyball and ice hockey, which are stronger in certain 
regions of the country, do not use this criterion. Instead, the athletes are 
placed on teams irrespective of their hometown in order to balance the power. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at some of the Orange County athletes expected to compete: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Peter Campbell: A graduate of University High School and UC Irvine, 
Campbell, 29, helped lead the U.S. water polo team to a silver medal in the 
1984 and 1988 Olympics. Campbell played in his first Olympic Festival in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I've basically retired from international competition," said Campbell, who 
will play defense for the West, "but I still have a bit of the bug. Besides, I 
had fun last time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bonnie Dasse: This will be the fourth Olympic Festival for Dasse, a 
graduate of Costa Mesa High, Orange Coast College and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Dasse, 29, and a resident of Costa Mesa, was the No. 2 women's shotputter in 
the nation from 1985-88 behind former SDSU teammate Ramona Pagel. Last year, 
Dasse reached the final at the Seoul Olympics. Dasse, an accountant in a 
Newport Beach development firm, said 1989 will be a rest year for her, 
involving very little training and competition. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons I'm going (to the Olympic Festival) is I really like their 
medals," said Dasse, a silver medalist in 1983 and a gold medalist in 1986 and 
1987. "Every medal I have from there is my favorite." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Doehring: Although he has regularly finished among the top 10 in 
national open and collegiate competition since 1984, Doehring, 27, was not very 
well-known until he made the Olympic team last year. Doehring is now a 
70-foot-plus shot putter. 
</P>
<P>
Doehring grew up in Newport Beach, but moved to San Clemente in his sophomore 
year. Although Doehring suffered serious back injuries in a motorcycle crash, 
he recovered and went on to a successful career at San Jose State, placing 
third in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. final in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arlise Emerson: While at Westminster High School in 1978, Emerson set the 
Orange County prep record in the 400-meter dash at 53.42 seconds. That record 
still stands. 
</P>
<P>
After a four-year break from competition, Emerson, 27, and a resident of 
Everett, Wash., has been on the comeback trail for the past six months. Her 
results have been impressive. At the Irvine Elite Invitational in June, Emerson 
clocked a 53.52, fast enough to gain her entry into The Athletics Congress 
national championships a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Although she was ill and not able to break 54 seconds at the TAC nationals, 
Emerson was encouraged. Her biggest goal is to better her personal best of 
51.69 set in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jenny Evans: The Times' Orange County girls' volleyball player of the year 
in 1987 led Newport Harbor High to a Southern Section championship and to the 
State finals. Now entering her sophomore year at UCLA, Evans, a 5-11 outside 
hitter, is following in the steps of her older sister, Julie, a volleyball 
player who went to the Olympic Festival in 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Julie Foudy: The three-time Times' Orange County player of the year in 
soccer led Mission Viejo High to three consecutive Southern Section titles. 
Foudy, who will represent the West, is the youngest player on the U.S. senior 
national team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michele Granger: The Valencia High graduate now at California is no 
stranger to international competition. Granger, a left-handed pitcher, has 
played in tournaments worldwide, including the Pan-American Games. She will 
represent the North. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Adam Keefe: During the 1987-88 season, Keefe, then playing for Woodbridge 
High's basketball team, was second in the county in scoring (26.3), fourth in 
rebounds (13.8) and eighth in field goal percentage (61.7%). Now, going into 
his sophomore year at Stanford, the 6-10 Keefe has already made an impact with 
the Cardinal, both on its basketball and volleyball teams. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first Olympic Festival for Keefe, who will represent the West in 
basketball. -- Elaine Youngs: A standout basketball and volleyball player while 
at El Toro High School, from which she graduated in 1988. Like Evans, Youngs is 
now at UCLA. She was one of only two freshmen to be named an NCAA volleyball 
All-American. Youngs will represent the North.

STOCK WATCH: ENVIRONMENTAL DIAGNOSTICS CUTS ITS STAKE IN DISEASE DETECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Environmental Diagnostics Inc. is learning to let go. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the North Carolina-based manufacturer of medical test kits gave 
birth to Disease Detection International in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Begun as one of Environmental Diagnostics' divisions, Disease Detection went 
public in 1987. Former Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt left his 
position as chairman at Environmental Diagnostics to run the new company. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since then, the two firms have fought over various technology rights. 
Environmental Diagnostics last year even launched an unsuccessful proxy battle 
to gain control of Disease Detection, which also makes test kits. 
</P>
<P>
But Environmental Diagnostic has apparently given up and has begun to 
systematically sell its huge stake in Disease Detection. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the company disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that it has sold nearly 1.9 million shares of Disease Detection for 
about $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We still feel as strong as we did when we embarked on a proxy battle to 
replace their board directors that we are not satisfied with the management of 
DDI," said Peter Heath, Environmental Diagnostics' controller. "That situation 
has not changed." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Disease Detection claims not to care that Environmental 
Diagnostics is unloading its shares. "That's fine with us," said H. Thad 
Morris, Disease Detection's president. 
</P>
<P>
Since September, Environmental Diagnostics has sold 6.5 million of its 32.1 
million shares of Disease Detection. The sales -- coupled with a stock offering 
by Disease Detection -- has reduced Environmental Diagnostic's stake in the 
company from 27.2% to 17.2% 
</P>
<P>
Heath said his company would sell even more of its shares of Disease Detection 
but SEC rules say a corporate investor cannot sell more than 1% of any company 
in a 90-day period. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there is no value to us holding on to it," Heath said. 
</P>
<P>
Disease Detection, which has 28 employees, reported sales for the first quarter 
ended March 31 of $88,104 and it lost nearly four times that -- $323,983. The 
company's stock is worth a quarter a share. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Diagnostics is still on the critical list too. The company had 
sales during the first quarter of $788,000 but lost $773,000. Its stock closed 
Friday at $1.09. 
</P>
<P>
Helionetics Inc. in Irvine said its common stock began trading on NASDAQ Friday 
under the symbol HLXC. The electrical equipment manufacturer's common stock 
also trades on the Pacific Stock Exchange under the symbol HLX.P.

WATER-SAVING LANDSCAPES YIELD PROFITS FOR FIRMS IN SEMIARID REGIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, the baroque bronze and marble Esplanade Fountain, with its 
abundant flow of crystal-clear water cascading amid the lush, bluegrass lawns 
of Denver's City Park, looks like any public fountain in any public park. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a striking difference. The water in that fountain -- and, indeed, 
much of the water pouring from fountains and faucets here on the eastern edge 
of the Rocky Mountains -- is water that has defied the laws of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is not enough water on the eastern slope of the Rockies to meet 
the needs of the "Front Range Megalopolis" -- the scattered chain of cities 
running from Albuquerque to Cheyenne -- local governments have filled the gap 
by moving water across the Continental Divide. 
</P>
<P>
A multibillion-dollar array of dams and canals, high-powered pumps and tunnels 
moves fresh water hundreds of miles from the western slope across the mountains 
to the thirsty cities here on the high plains. 
</P>
<P>
Because the water infrastructure throughout the arid West was built largely 
with federal dollars, westerners historically have had little economic 
incentive to preserve their sparse water. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the people of Denver and other cities throughout the West are far more 
profligate in water use than their cousins back East. 
</P>
<P>
Today, though, with federal funds drying up, water is becoming a costlier 
commodity throughout the mountain and basin states. And that has created a new 
economic opportunity for companies selling a new idea: water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
A whole range of new products and services have sprung up in this region over 
the past five years or so to help folks cut their water bills by cutting 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
But among the more ingenious of the water-conservation businesses have been 
those offering a new line of landscaping and horticultural products grouped 
under the general term xeriscape. 
</P>
<P>
Xeriscape, a neologism coined from the Greek root xeros, or dry, is a 
back-to-nature business based on the idea that certain flowers, grasses and 
shrubs have flourished for centuries in desert climates. 
</P>
<P>
By planting those species in place of the familiar rose gardens and bluegrass 
lawns imported here from the more humid East Coast, homeowners, businesses and 
governments can dramatically cut their use of water. 
</P>
<P>
In eastern cities like Washington and Baltimore, average water use per person 
each day runs about 120 gallons (a little more in summer, less in winter). In 
Denver the per capita daily usage is almost double -- 230 gallons. In Phoenix 
it's 250 gallons. Out in the middle of the Arizona desert, in the retirement 
community called Carefree, people consume about 750 gallons of water each per 
day, according to the Fresh Water Society, a conservation group. 
</P>
<P>
This is not because people in Carefree take more showers than Baltimoreans, or 
because Denver makes more iced tea than D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the difference in consumption is almost all outside, where people, 
businesses and parks departments water their lawns and plants. Since Carefree 
gets less than one-fourth as much rain each year as Washington does, its 
residents run the sprinklers much, much more. 
</P>
<P>
The theory underlying xeriscape landscapes is that these consumption figures 
could be drastically cut if people in this dry land would switch to dry-land 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
The name xeriscape and much of the impetus behind this emerging idea came from 
the Denver Water Board, which supplies fresh water to cities and suburbs along 
the Colorado Front Range. 
</P>
<P>
The water board began an intensive search some years back for a landscaping 
alternative to the lush but thirsty lawns grown from eastern grasses. John 
Wilder, a Denver conservation officer, found an obscure text on the topic 
entitled "Xerophilic Plants." A light flashed in his head, and the term 
xeriscape was born. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the xeriscape philosophy has become a hardy perennial and a top producer 
for seed companies, landscape firms and garden-implement makers throughout the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had a sizable increase in business -- sizable -- over the past three 
to five years by selling low-water-use plants," said Lon Carbaugh of Anderson 
Seed Co., a Greeley, Colo.-based nursery and seed catalogue house. 
</P>
<P>
"The business comes mostly from new construction, from landscaping in cities 
and around new building sites," Carbaugh said. "We have golf courses buying 
these low-water-use grass seeds too. The initial cost of the seed is more 
expensive right now because the demand is so high. But with the water rates 
going up, there are real savings down the line with these new grasses." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every nursery or seed company from Montana to Arizona now offers a wide 
variety of xeriscape plants and grasses, and there are firms sprouting 
throughout the region that deal solely in unthirsty plants. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Phillips noticed during hikes in the New Mexico desert that nature has 
spawned a huge variety of plants that survive beautifully in this arid region 
without hoses or sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
She turned that observation into a business in Albuquerque, Bernardo Beach 
Native Plants, that is flourishing on trade with landscapers and real-estate 
developers seeking an alternative to the familiar, but thirsty, bluegrass lawn. 
</P>
<P>
The idea has spread as well to some of the national seed companies, including 
the biggest of them all, W. Atlee Burpee Co. The newest Burpee catalogue 
includes several pages of drought-resistant flowers like gaillardia and Texas 
bluebonnet and low-water native grasses like feathertop. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to plants, the xeriscape idea has also sparked business 
opportunities for garden implement firms -- companies like California-based 
Rain Bird Irrigation, which sells a surprisingly varied line of 
water-conserving sprinkler and garden-irrigation systems. 
</P>
<P>
Developers in Denver, Phoenix, Albuquerque and Tucson now regularly boast in 
full-page ads that their new subdivisions come with xeriscape lawns. 
</P>
<P>
But does xeriscaping mean that every lawn or park has to look like the Sonoran 
desert? Not at all, say the advocates of the new idea. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our biggest jobs is getting across to people that xeriscape is not a 
bunch of sand and rocks with a couple of yucca plants and cactus," said Ed 
Reutz of the Denver Water Board. "Xeriscape lawns can be all green. Xeriscape 
gardens have as much variety of flowers and colors as you'd find in a formal 
English garden." 
</P>
<P>
The most common xeriscape alternatives to the bluegrass or fescue lawns 
transplanted here from moister climates are buffalo grass and blue gamma, which 
happens to be the official state grass of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Such lawns are generally grown from seed. They look richly green until about 
the end of June, when the western summers turn dry and windy. Then they go to a 
greenish-yellow for the rest of the summer, and come back green again the 
following spring. Unlike bluegrass lawns, a lawn of blue gamma generally needs 
no watering other than the sparse summer rains. 
</P>
<P>
From a distance, a blue gamma lawn looks like bluegrass, at least until the dog 
days of summer. Up close, though, it's easy to see that the dry-land grasses 
don't provide the same thick blanket of coverage as an eastern lawn, and they 
don't have the same springy feel underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
In the flower garden, species like gaillardia, or "blanket flower," a deep red 
daisy-like flower with petals tipped a bright yellow, and the soft blue Rocky 
Mountain penstemon, the perfectly formed yellow cinquefoil, and orange or red 
coreopsis all make easy-to-grow non-thirsty alternatives to zinnias and 
marigolds. 
</P>
<P>
There are hundreds of flowering plants native to arid regions; more and more 
have been domesticated and put on sale in nurseries because of the xeriscape 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
"We started with a basic catalogue of real safe xeriscape stuff," said Pat 
Hayward of the Little Valley Nursery, a big plant wholesaler in Brighton, Colo. 
"Now it contains about 1,000 varieties." While demand for low-water-use plants 
is growing -- particularly among landscaping professionals -- Hayward said, 
"the concept requires a little more education for a lot of home gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't call them 'xeriscape' plants. That seems so complicated," Hayward 
continued. "We call them native, or dry-land, or water-smart. And they sell. 
Every time one of these towns around here has a water-rate increase, they sell 
even better."

NOT ALWAYS EASY TO KNOW JUST WHERE YOUR MONEY IS

Do you know where your money is? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, you say. It is in a money market fund. But there are 469 of those, with 
$323 billion in assets, according to last week's statistics from the Investment 
Company Institute, an industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know what it is doing in that money market fund? With whom is your cash 
keeping company? Does it hang out in high-grade government securities and 
corporate bonds or with junk commercial paper? Do you know which ones? Does it 
matter? 
</P>
<P>
Usually it doesn't matter. Most of the time your money is in safe company. 
</P>
<P>
But then along comes a default like that of Integrated Resources commercial 
paper and questions arise about what kind of investments the funds are holding 
and whether investors can get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Integrated, a New York real estate and investment company, defaulted on $995 
million in short-term debt last month, including $373 million in commercial 
paper, short-term debt that corporations sell to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
When asked, executives for many major money market funds said: "Integrated 
commercial paper, what's that? We don't have any," and heaved a sigh of relief. 
Or they said with self-congratulatory glee: "It didn't pass our credit checks. 
Didn't even come close." But not everyone was that astute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm Did Honorable Thing 
</P>
<P>
Value Line Inc., whose $630-million money market fund had about $24 million of 
Integrated's commercial paper, did the honorable thing and bought the paper out 
of the fund to protect its shareholders. Mutual of New York, which had about $9 
million in its Liquid Green Trust money market fund, has said the fund will not 
allow anyone to take a loss. 
</P>
<P>
As a group, money market funds are considered very safe. 
</P>
<P>
"I would suggest that this is the first time that a money market fund bought 
something that didn't pay off at maturity. And since 1980 nobody (no 
shareholder) has lost any money, which is amazing considering the fluctuations 
of the 1980s," said William Donoghue, publisher of Donoghue's Money Fund 
report, an industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry has been able to maintain its reputation of keeping the net asset 
value of the funds," said Dick Pogue, senior vice president of the Investment 
Company Institute, who said that Value Line did the right thing for the 
industry, as well as its shareholders, by buying back the paper to preserve the 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
Funds have been tempted to buy speculative-grade commercial paper to attain 
higher yields to attract shareholders, but funds that dip into that riskier 
category tend to limit the purchase to tiny percentages of the fund. Some money 
market funds competing on yield are now cutting back on the management fees 
they charge the fund, so they can push the yield even higher. Eventually, 
though, they will charge those fees back, reducing the yield. But by that time, 
they hope inertia and a competitive return will keep most people in their 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Updated Information 
</P>
<P>
One high-yield money market fund, Fidelity Investments' Spartan Fund, will 
supply updated portfolio information every two weeks, said marketing vice 
president Neal Litvak at Fidelity. "They will tell you the top 10 holdings for 
that two-week period," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But most shareholders will have a problem finding out what their money market 
funds invest in at any given time. A prospectus might say a fund invests in 
high-grade commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1, or government bonds or high-grade 
corporate debt rated Aa or AA or better, depending on the rating agency. 
</P>
<P>
But even the semiannual statement you get will not tell you exactly what a fund 
is now holding. It will tell you only what it did hold. Fund officials say that 
by the time the report is compiled and sent out, it is 45 to 60 days old, and 
that means it is outdated, because the average maturity of instruments in money 
funds is 38 days, according to Donoghue's newletter. 
</P>
<P>
More frequent updates would cost too much money, said one fund executive. "To 
notify a million shareholders of what the fund is holding would be an expense 
against the fund because it is for the benefit of current shareholders and 
would lower yield," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody asks the same question about what bank CDs (certificates of deposit) 
are invested in," said Gerald Cole, executive vice president of Kemper 
Financial Services, "and there is no ability at any time to know what they 
(CDs) are in. People don't care because of the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp.) insurance. But the insurance costs something and you pay for it in the 
yield. 
</P>
<P>
"The first objective of the portfolio manager should be the safety of the 
principal," Cole said. "The second is to get as high a yield as is consistent 
with maintaining the integrity of the first objective."
