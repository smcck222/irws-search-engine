For those who prefer to skip the museum and go directly to the gift shop: 
</P>
<P>
New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art is opening a retail outlet in the Century 
City Shopping Center this fall. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to posters and stationery, reproductions of sculptures from the 
Met's massive collection will be offered for purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Also available will be museum memberships -- for the old-fashioned folks who 
would rather gawk at the originals on 5th Avenue than spend all their time and 
money at the West Coast, Westside retail emporium. 
</P>
<P>
Switching from Manhattan to Manhattan Beach, but keeping with the subject of 
art: 
</P>
<P>
Those city-installed dumbbell sculptures that were heisted from a seaside bench 
last month still have not been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a surprise if they did turn up," acknowledged Howard Spector, the 
community's public arts administrator. "There was no reward put up this time." 
</P>
<P>
"DDumbbell," consisting of two cast bronze 25-pound hand weights, was first 
stolen hours after being bolted down by city workers last September. The art 
piece was recovered that time with the help of a $500 reward. Police were on 
the lookout for any suspicious-looking hulks, possibly with hernias. 
</P>
<P>
Add serial criminals: the mad manhole-cover lifter is still on the loose. 
</P>
<P>
City sanitation officials report that 185 of the iron covers now have 
disappeared in little more than a week in locations ranging from Hollywood to 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
With the total replacement cost exceeding $15,000, authorities are beseeching 
the public for help. 
</P>
<P>
"If you see someone lifting a manhole cover, especially the ones in the 
sidewalk near the corner catch basins, please report the event," says 
Sanitation Bureau Director Delwin A. Biagi. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities surmise that the thief has been getting away in a vehicle. Each 
cover weighs 40 pounds. Police were on the lookout for any suspicious-looking 
hulks, possibly with hernias. 
</P>
<P>
America's most wanted: Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who has shunned the spotlight 
since his defeat in the June Democratic primary for state attorney general, 
also skipped the National District Attorney's Assn. conference in Kalispell, 
Mont., this past weekend. The session was held at a rural resort called, of all 
things, the Outlaw Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Need a lift? Today marks the start of "Things Are Looking Up Week" in Los 
Angeles, in conjunction with the 1990 International Jugglers Assn. convention 
at UCLA. More than 1,000 prestidigitators are expected to be on hand for a slew 
of juggling-while-running races, consecutive-toss contests and an all-star 
comedy-juggling show. Police were expected to be in the audience, on the 
lookout for anyone juggling manhole covers. 
</P>
<P>
Do city sign makers have trouble with heights? 
</P>
<P>
After seeing a picture of a "Castle Hegihts Avenue" street sign in Only in L.A. 
last month, reader Steve Kipnis reports that he happened upon a sign in 
Hollywood for "Crescent Heihts Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Faith, Hope and Charity streets were once side by side in downtown L.A. But 
residents of the latter resented jokes about "living on Charity," and it was 
changed to Grand. Faith was later renamed Flower. Hope remains.

FAN GIVEN 6 YEARS FOR BREAK-INS AT GLESS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman described as an obsessed fan of actress Sharon Gless was sentenced 
Monday to six years in state prison after pleading no contest to twice breaking 
into Gless' home with a loaded rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Joni Leigh Penn, 30, of Garden Grove, intended to sexually 
assault Gless and commit suicide in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
But the Emmy Award-winning actress, who starred in the 1980s police drama 
"Cagney and Lacey," was not at her Studio City home during either break-in last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Penn, whose trial was scheduled to start today, pleaded no contest to two 
felony counts of residential burglary with special allegations that she was 
armed with a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an indirect plea from Gless that Penn be sentenced to the maximum of 
nine years and four months, Superior Court Judge John Major sentenced her to 
the six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he was giving Penn less than the maximum in part because she has 
expressed remorse for the break-ins. Deputy Public Defender Mitch Bruckner also 
pointed out that no one was injured during the break-ins and that Penn had no 
criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
Penn will be eligible for parole in about three years. 
</P>
<P>
Gless was not in court Monday. However, in a telephone conversation earlier 
Monday with Deputy Dist. Atty. Lori Dery, she asked Dery and co-prosecutor Ken 
Barshop to press for the maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"She is concerned for her safety and strongly felt that the defendant deserved 
the maximum term," Dery said. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants her (Penn) to be away from her as long as possible. She doesn't want 
another similar situation to occur," Dery said. 
</P>
<P>
Before sentencing, Penn made a brief statement to the court in which "she 
apologized to Miss Gless and her family for any distress she caused them and 
reassured Miss Gless that she will be safe," Dery said. 
</P>
<P>
Dery said she hopes that while in prison, Penn will receive needed psychiatric 
counseling to break her fixation on the actress. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released after the March 30 break-in, Gless said: "These are 
horrendous times that we live in, especially when disturbed people have such 
easy access to weapons that can be used indiscriminately." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have described Penn as an obsessed fan who is in love with Gless 
and whose nearly 100 letters to the actress prompted Gless to obtain a court 
restraining order against her in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a loaded .22-caliber rifle, Penn broke into Gless' home on March 27 
and stole her address book in an apparent attempt to locate other residences 
where the actress might live. 
</P>
<P>
Penn again broke into the home through a window on March 30, and barricaded 
herself in the bathroom with the loaded weapon. 
</P>
<P>
A police SWAT team, alerted by a silent alarm, was called to the scene and 
evacuated residences surrounding the actress's secluded home. After seven hours 
of negotiations during which Penn repeatedly threatened to kill herself, she 
surrendered. Police confiscated a rifle and an ammunition clip containing 13 
bullets.

PASADENA BLAST PROMPTS WIDER STATE SAFETY INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State investigators probing last week's electrical vault explosion in Pasadena 
that killed three city workers said Monday that they are also looking into a 
similar blast in Los Angeles two years ago, and any other similar explosions, 
to determine if changes in safety procedures may be required. 
</P>
<P>
Isaac Chae, district manager at the Cal/OSHA office in Covina, said he has 
contacted other Cal/OSHA offices for reports of vault explosions and has 
requested that a senior safety engineer with electrical expertise be sent to 
Pasadena from agency headquarters in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's occurring all over in a similar nature, we would take a fresh look at 
it and (devise) safety ordinances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The procedure of how to enter into the vault is one aspect we have to look 
into," he added. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how many such explosions have occurred or how many 
Cal/OSHA will include in its investigation. Electrical vault explosions are not 
uncommon, but power company officials said they do not keep specific figures on 
such incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's blast in Pasadena killed foreman Walter (Glenn) Wise, 50, of Temple 
City, and two cable splicers, Brian Miles, 36, of Pasadena, and Larry Hokenson, 
38, of West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
The men died in a 10-foot-deep underground electrical vault after a 4,000-volt 
power line exploded about 10:25 p.m. The three had entered the vault to repair 
a 17,000-volt line that had exploded two hours earlier. Power on the 4,000-volt 
line had not been disconnected as they worked on the 17,000-volt line. 
</P>
<P>
City officials plan to schedule a memorial service for the three employees 
later this week. Meanwhile, services for Wise will be held at 10 a.m. today at 
Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier. Services for Miles will be held at 10 
a.m. Thursday at the First AME Church in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Information on arrangements for Hokenson was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles explosion occurred July 8, 1988, when a so-called junction box 
exploded, injuring six of seven workers in a Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power vault. A junction box is used to switch power temporarily from one 
power line to another. 
</P>
<P>
The workers suffered bruises and burns, but all have since returned to work, 
said Robert McMillen, a Los Angeles water and power engineer. 
</P>
<P>
As in the Pasadena incident, the workers were surrounded by "energized" power 
lines. Both Pasadena and Los Angeles power department officials said workers 
avoid shutting down power lines during repairs to avoid cutting off service to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison, which serves 4 million customers, follows a similar 
procedure, said spokeswoman Diane Wittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"The technology for working on 'hot' lines has been around for decades," she 
said. "The chance of random failure of other lines is so remote." 
</P>
<P>
Wittenberg added, however, that Edison engineers were surprised recently to 
learn that electrical workers in Britain regularly de-energize power lines 
while making repairs, leaving customers temporarily without service.

SOVIET UNION'S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Williams' analysis of the staying power of communism in Russia ("Soviets Try to 
Repair Communism, Won't Give It Bum's Rush," July 6) in which Marxism "was the 
deliberate choice of the majority of the Russian people" is rather wide of the 
mark. While it is true that the ruling Communist Party is much more entrenched 
within the structure of Russian society than in other East Bloc countries, it 
is not popular support that must be overcome in unseating the Communists from 
power. 
</P>
<P>
This misconception, believed in the West for decades, is at the heart of 
Kremlin leader's misreading of the events taking place within their empire and 
explains their inability to cope with the changes that will eventually sweep 
away the Communist Party, or at least, render it insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to party doctrine, communism was never "accepted" in Russia. By 1917, 
the czar and the nobility had been ousted, the Kerensky government was 
foundering and thousands of foot soldiers had come home, refusing to continue 
fighting against Germany. It was in this state of anarchy that the Bolsheviks, 
led by Lenin, seized power, and it was with brutal suppression of dissent that 
they consolidated and maintained it. To suppose that Lenin and his men were 
swept into power on a ground swell of popular support for Marxist ideology is a 
gross misinterpretation of historical fact. There was never any mandate for 
Communist rule; the Bolsheviks were simply the most cohesive and ruthless 
political faction in Russia at the time. The same can be said of all Marxist 
revolutions.

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a tragedy for the Twitchells, the Christian Scientist couple convicted of 
relying too heavily on faith in God to relieve the afflictions of their son 
("Christian Scientists Convicted in Death," July 5 and "Parents Placed on 
Probation in Son's Death," July 7). They lost their son and their faith is 
severely challenged by that loss. Adding insult to considerable injury, they 
are prosecuted for neglect. 
</P>
<P>
What an ironic tragedy for a largely "Christian," self-proclaimed "scientific" 
society that has forgotten the centrality of faith to its own survival. It is 
not very Christian to throw stones at those who petition God for help. It is 
not very scientific to discount the value of faith for the successful response 
of the immune system to physical trauma and disease -- ask Norman Cousins of 
the UCLA medical community. 
</P>
<P>
I remember a society that used to print "In God We Trust" on every coin and 
dollar. At one time, we probably meant it. 
</P>
<P>
How do we contrast this motto with what we see in the courtrooms? Couples who 
pray for spiritual intervention get thrown in jail, those who rely on fertility 
drugs and medical guidance can successfully sue for millions when only three of 
their septuplets survive. 
</P>
<P>
Medicine is no exact science. For every breakthrough in our understanding of 
the mechanics of life, there is created a vast gulf of unanswered questions -- 
it is as convoluted a system of beliefs as any religion. 
</P>
<P>
Medicine needs faith in the unknown to work. Medicine without faith is as 
ill-advised as a society without religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Jetta Bernier of the Massachusetts Committee for Children and Youth sees this 
prosecution as a victory for children stating, "No individual should have to 
suffer and die because of the religious beliefs of another." 
</P>
<P>
Beliefs are one thing, faith is another. Children's interests are not served by 
society's hounding of individuals who trust too strongly in God. Society should 
be convicted for neglect of its own motto.

IMPORTANCE OF BEING RICH;

KOHL, ON A ROLL, ADVANCES GERMAN REUNIFICATION IN A MAJOR DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Europe would appear to be on the least turbulent course to the future that 
anyone could imagine, thanks to two country boys whose political lives depended 
on making what just a few weeks ago seemed a very unlikely deal. 
</P>
<P>
The West has said all along that membership in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization would bind a unified Germany to Europe and make war on the 
Continent less likely. The Soviet Union never agreed publicly, but the West 
also argued that the arrangement would protect Moscow as much as it would 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
What had NATO holding its breath were doubts that Moscow would ever agree to 
let Germany decide for itself whether it wanted to join NATO or the collapsing 
Soviet-sponsored Warsaw Pact or both or neither. Historians made a case that 
joining neither would leave Germany adrift on the Continent just as it was in 
1914 and in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Moscow has signaled that it will go along. And measured against the 
changes sweeping the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the decision probably is 
no more startling than, say, church bells ringing in Kiev or a huge 
anti-Communist rally just outside the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
Accounts of a joint press conference with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl at 
which Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced his agreement noted 
reluctance. "We were realists," he said at the end of a weekend with Kohl in 
Stavropol, a farming town in the eastern foothills of the Caucasus where 
Gorbachev grew up. "We assessed the direction of change," he said, which 
translates fairly effortlessly into going with the flow. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is hedged but not evasive. Germany's membership will come 
"eventually," but apparently not before the three or four years it will take to 
move 350,000 Soviet troops out of East Germany. There will be some haggling 
over the acceptable limit NATO imposes on total troop strength of a unified 
Germany. Kohl is said to accept a ceiling of 370,000 Germans in the new army. 
But it seemed solid enough for President Bush to congratulate Gorbachev for 
statesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's deal makes it possible for Germany to stay on its unification 
schedule. That's good for Kohl, who always seems in the opinion polls to be 
hanging by his thumbs. Staying on schedule improves his chances for reelection 
as chancellor not only of West Germany but of the reunited country. 
</P>
<P>
As for Gorbachev, bowing to the inevitable probably gives the Soviet Union its 
best chance to share in the prosperity Europe expects after its national 
economies merge in 1992. The deal will also make Germans feel a whole lot 
better about parting with the billions in aid Kohl proposes. In a nation of 
bare shelves and shoddy goods, absolutely nothing is more important to 
Gorbachev's constituents.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE'S IN DANGER OF STAYING ON A BUMPY ROLL

Bill Brubaker of the Washington Post, writing about professional gamblers' 
influence on athletes, mentioned former Baltimore and Indianapolis Colt 
quarterback Art Schlichter, who was suspended by the NFL in 1983 after he 
reportedly piled up $750,000 in gambling debts. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, Schlichter underwent treatment for a gambling addiction, then 
was arrested on gambling charges. 
</P>
<P>
Brubaker: "Schlichter, who entered another treatment center last fall, now 
quarterbacks the Detroit Drive of the Arena Football League. At 30, he said he 
dreams of returning to the NFL. Last spring he was observed betting on sporting 
events in Las Vegas hotels, according to (NFL security director Warren) Welsh 
and Nevada gambling sources. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody said if you're ever looking for Art Schlichter, all you have to do is 
go to the Stardust," Welsh said. "With no mask or anything else, I guess he was 
just hanging out there. Art's had his problems." 
</P>

Trivia time: What was the most lopsided game in NBA history? 
</P>
<P>
Educated guess: Ted Turner, owner of Turner Broadcasting and the Atlanta 
Braves, says the network's board of directors isn't sure how far into the red 
the upcoming Goodwill Games will go. He expects the figure will be about $10 
million, considerably less than the $24 million TBS says it lost on the 1986 
Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
"The board has not set a dollar limit (on losses)," Turner told United Press 
International. "We don't know what it will be until after the games. It's like 
I don't know if the Braves will have a losing record. But I suppose we will." 
</P>
<P>
Wise guy: Until last Thursday at Chicago, the Milwaukee Brewers had played six 
extra-inning games, going 22 extra innings without a run. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brewer second baseman Jim Gantner: "Geez, no wonder we lost them all." 
</P>
<P>
Rooking their pawns: From Joe Hamelin of the Sacramento Bee, on last weekend's 
celebrity golf tournament at South Lake Tahoe: "If America will watch this sort 
of thing -- and, worse, if it will pay for the privilege -- then it will 
probably admire some of the other productions that NBC is considering to fill 
the drab summer weekends. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Cooking with Joe Montana,' for one. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Pete Rose's Tax Tips.' 
</P>
<P>
"And, of course, the ever-popular 'Celebrity Chess.' " 
</P>
<P>
K, 2-9-2-3: In the fourth inning of Montreal's 16-14 victory over Atlanta 
Sunday, with a 1-and-2 count, two out and runners at first and second, the 
Braves' Jim Presley tried to check his swing on Tim Burke's pitch in the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Mike Fitzgerald scooped the ball and threw wildly past first baseman 
Andres Galarraga and into right field. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Treadway took off from second, Ron Gant from first. Right fielder Marquis 
Grissom retrieved the ball and threw home, too late to get Treadway. Gant 
stopped at third. 
</P>
<P>
Expo third baseman Tim Wallach appealed to first base umpire Bob Davidson and 
hollered to Fitzgerald to throw the ball to Galarraga. He did, and Davidson 
called Presley, still standing at the plate dumbfounded, out. 
</P>
<P>
Add K, 2-9-2-3: Bobby Cox, the Braves' manager, argued the call and was 
ejected.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

Al Davis might want to move the Raiders to Oakland this season, but the 
question is whether the Los Angeles Coliseum will let him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have two years remaining on their lease here. The Coliseum can 
either accept a monetary settlement or, if the Raiders attempt to leave without 
permission, file an injunction seeking to keep them in L.A. in 1990 and '91. 
Why would the Coliseum possibly want a lame-duck franchise? Spite. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco -- the 6-foot-3, 230-pound slugger -- isn't joking when he says 
he's thinking of hiring a bodyguard. Most heavyweight boxing champions have 
used one. Some jerk always wants to start a fight, and it's easy to break a 
bare hand in retaliation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Just think what a murderer's row the San Francisco Giants would have if they 
had signed Barry Bonds in 1982 after drafting him on the second round out of 
high school. Another $5,000 would have done the job, but Bonds instead enrolled 
at Arizona State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Joe Morgan, the broadcaster, would make a better manager than Joe Morgan, the 
Boston Red Sox manager. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The most underrated power hitter in baseball is Toronto's Fred McGriff, who led 
the American League in home runs last year and has 20 this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell is so strong that he was able to smash a 430-foot homer off John 
Tudor in St. Louis Sunday night, although he was fooled by the pitch and hit it 
off the wrong foot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's bare-handed catch last year was the best I've ever seen. Over the 
weekend, Felix Jose moved into the second spot and Ken Griffey into third. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Only 802 more strikeouts before Nolan Ryan reaches 6,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Atlanta got 20 hits, Kansas City 18 and Minnesota 16. And the Royals 
and Twins won their games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Angels won't set a record for most different lineups in a season only 
because there is no such record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Jim Everett and Bart Simpson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
During the spring quarter, 199 UCLA student-athletes achieved a grade-point 
average of at least 3.0. Fifty-seven were 3.5-or-higher scholars. . . . 
</P>
<P>
NBA director of scouting Marty Blake says this about the Clippers and Lakers 
draft choices: Bo Kimble -- "Bo will be ideal for the Clippers." Loy Vaught -- 
"He's going to be one of the best power forwards in the league." Elden 
Campbell: "No question, he's a very good pick here." . . . 
</P>
<P>
High praise, indeed, but Blake had kind words for all 27 first-round picks in 
the NBA newsletter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Each letter in Vaught's first name represents a name of a relative -- "L" from 
Uncle Louie, "o" from Uncle Oliver and "y" from Aunt Yvonne. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mark Spitz, who is attempting to become swimming's version of George Foreman, 
will appear on "Larry King Live" tonight on CNN and then join Foreman at the 
Goodwill Games Saturday and Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What does Brian Shaw find so intriguing about Italy now that the World Cup is 
over? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don Baylor, Nolan Cromwell, Steve Timmons and Paul Cleary will be inducted into 
the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame at its 10th annual banquet Thursday night 
at the Disneyland Hotel. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Are the New York Giants trying to win football games or fights? They've hired a 
kick-boxing expert to work with the players. . . . 
</P>
<P>
When Jerry Seeman takes over as supervisor of NFL officials in 1991, I'll miss 
the smile he always seems to wear on his face when he calls penalties. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In a final tuneup for the Goodwill Games, the U.S. water polo team will play 
Hungary Thursday night at the Belmont Plaza pool in Long Beach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Those rinkside seats that will cost $205 apiece for King games next season 
actually are some of the worst in the Forum for hockey. It's like watching 
football from the sidelines. . . . 
</P>
<P>
True friends of Thomas Hearns and Mark Breland are advising them to quit 
boxing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rocky Marciano, who could have beaten Floyd Patterson, was one of the only 
fighters who ever retired too early. . . . 
</P>
<P>
All too typical of the diluted texture of thoroughbred racing was the Vanity 
Handicap Sunday at Hollywood Park. It's a $200,000, Grade I event that annually 
decides the meeting's female championship. Yet only five fillies and mares, 
including a betting entry, went postward, and there was no show wagering after 
trainer Ron McAnally rightfully scratched Bayakoa when she was asked to give 
four pounds in weight to Gorgeous. So Gorgeous romped by five lengths and paid 
$3 and $2.10. Ah, for the good old days of full fields. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics' Jose is underpaid -- Felix Jose, that is.

EVEN NOSTALGIA SUFFERS IN STEINBRENNER REIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yankee Oldtimers Day used to be ... well, it used to be glory to the highest. 
Memories of Ruth and DiMaggio and Mantle; Gomez, Reynolds and Ford -- and a 
line of nostalgia and prenostalgia that stretched as far as the heart could 
see. 
</P>
<P>
Well, nostalgia isn't what it used to be. Somehow the Steinbrenner reign has 
managed to drain the life and breath out of that, too. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Phil Rizzuto was honored for 50 years -- a half-century -- of 
service to the Yankees provides the bright light that emphasizes the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzuto remains the good guy in an organization that has made good people 
suffer (see Bucky Dent standing so relaxed at the batting cage with the 
Yankees' oldtimers). People told tales of delight about Rizzuto that made the 
day what it was. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees invented Oldtimers Day for Lou Gehrig's retirement in 1939 and made 
it an annual institution with Babe Ruth Day in 1947. Now it's a way for them to 
seduce fannies into the seats. 
</P>
<P>
Will anybody come to see Eric Plunk in 20 years? Did anybody come to see Tom 
Shopay or Gary Thomasson Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
Better look at who wasn't there. After all, it was a day to honor Rizzuto. 
Tommy Henrich wasn't invited. Neither were Hank Bauer, Johnny Mize, Gene 
Woodling, Allie Reynolds, Eddie Lopat and Jerry Coleman. All they were, were 
the heart of the Rizzuto Yankee teams that won nine pennants and seven World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
The game has its budget, explained Jim Ogle, the director of the Yankee Alumni 
Association, "and we have to have guys young enough to play three innings." 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Mantle wasn't there, Ogle said, because the successor to The Great 
DiMaggio had a commitment to a card show in Rhode Island. You mean he didn't 
save this day? 
</P>
<P>
Yogi Berra wasn't invited because he has vowed not to return to Yankee Stadium 
as long as Steinbrenner owns the team. And he has the class to stick to it, to 
the point of apologizing over dinner to his old Rizzuto. (Yogi has not said 
what his position will be if Steinbrenner is suspended.) 
</P>
<P>
Dent brought with him the link to the Yankees' last pennant. It was that link 
to glory Steinbrenner cynically used when he brought Dent back to manage, a job 
he was neither prepared for nor suited to fill. On June 6 he was fired. 
</P>
<P>
And paid off in full, he explained Saturday. He wanted to make it perfectly 
clear, he said, that he had only good relations with Steinbrenner. "He never 
shouted at me," Dent said. 
</P>
<P>
He was just treated cruelly, which may explain why the nostalgic ovation for 
Dent trailed only those for DiMaggio and Rizzuto himself. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Rizzuto is not in the Hall of Fame is a great injustice. There 
can be no dynasty -- and rarely a pennant -- without a superior shortstop. Ted 
Williams has said that if the Red Sox had Rizzuto at shortstop on that 
great-hitting team, Boston would have had the succession of championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I am prejudiced," Whitey Ford said. "Phil was Most Valuable Player when I was 
a rookie." That was in 1950; how many shortstops have been voted MVP? 
</P>
<P>
Mantle came along in 1951. The thought of an Oldtimers Day without Mantle 
boggles the mind. What will it be when DiMaggio no longer can attend? He's 75. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the new order of hostility around the Yankees has come home to them. To 
this generation of Yankee fans, Dent's time is the new nostalgia. But Chris 
Chambliss was too busy to ask for a day off managing in the Detroit 
organization. Graig Nettles, Ogle said, had a prior commitment. Reggie Jackson 
declined the last two invitations and wasn't sent another. 
</P>
<P>
Roy White wasn't invited. Steinbrenner suspects it was White's contacts who 
directed pitcher Bill Gullickson to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
It is supposed to be a day of celebration -- even a time for the ink-stained 
wretches to draw on about bygone days with bygone players. But Steinbrenner's 
people set up more and more obstacles all the time. As one polite functionary 
said: "The feeling is not here no more." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is the talent, as the White Sox' six-run second inning Saturday exposed, 
the Yankees dropping fundamentals everywhere. They haven't finished last since 
1966 and haven't lost 90 games since 1967. They haven't lost 100 games, which 
appears to be their destiny, since 1912. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe this could happen," said Tommy Byrne, whose pitching benefited 
from Rizzuto's presence. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne recalled a ninth inning against Bob Lemon with DiMaggio on third base and 
one out. DiMaggio was moving on the squeeze and Lemon threw the ball directly 
at Rizzuto's head -- a difficult pitch to bunt. "Somehow Phil got the bat up 
here and put the ball down perfectly," Byrne said. "Joe scored and Lemon just 
threw his glove up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unbelievable. It was the greatest bunt I ever saw. And Phil ran to 
first base, so he got credit for the hit." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Brown, the president of the American League, played third base in eight 
of Rizzuto's seasons. "He played shorstop as well as it can be played," Brown 
said. "Nobody ever could make a double play better than Rizzuto and Coleman." 
</P>
<P>
Players were always putting crawly things in Rizzuto's glove -- or worse -- to 
see his terror. Johnny Lindell and Spec Shea once hid a live lobster in 
Rizzuto's pants leg. "The opposition did it, too," Ford said. "You don't do 
that unless you like a guy." 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 72, he is best known as a broadcaster and a character. Like the time 
his broadcasting partner Bobby Murcer got to the booth and asked Phil about 
what looked like a tobacco tin on the table. "That's Harry," Rizzuto explained. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a great Yankee fan who said, 'When I die, please scatter my ashes in 
center field in Yankee Stadium."' 
</P>
<P>
Rizzuto brought the urn, but the grounds crew wouldn't let him scatter the 
ashes. So Rizzuto was taking the urn home with him. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the ashes? You'll have to ask Rizzuto. I went to ask him, but 
he had already gone home. He wouldn't have left if the guys were there.

TO MCNAMARA, 1986 IS A LIFETIME AGO

<TEXT>
<P>
Players stop by, stick their head in and talk. They are greeted with a 
handshake, a piece of advice, even a smile. The door remains open, and the man 
in the office continues the quiet quest of achieving vindication by degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing preceding today matters much to John McNamara. History has not been 
especially kind to him, and he has never been completely comfortable in its 
presence. It has become a relationship of mutual disdain. He feels that history 
has a bad habit of omitting salient details, of translating gray issues in 
black and white. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the Cleveland Indians is back in his element now. He has control 
of a team that few give more than a passing thought, and he is herding it 
toward respectability. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where I belong," he said. "This is what I'm best suited to do." 
</P>
<P>
He has given most of his life to baseball, and the game occupies a place in him 
that may lie deeper than marrow. He has spent parts of four decades working in 
a position where his worth is measured by the actions of others. He has been 
fired five times. He has endured criticism, even humiliation. Each time, he has 
come back. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball's given me a way of life," he said. "That's getting into something 
I've never talked about. But the bottom line is I've walked through life 
enjoying what I've done, and I've been paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice thing is that I'm competent at what I do. I'm quiet; I mind my own 
business. I don't talk like a lot of the other managers. I don't feel that need 
to blow my own horn. But hell, I've done a few things in this game for a dumb 
kid from Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Seanez, a 21-year-old pitcher, walks in without knocking and asks a 
question. McNamara smiles and answers, then sends Seanez out with a pat on the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what's it's all about," McNamara says. "We're all friends here. That's 
what makes it great." 
</P>
<P>
McNamara goes one way, his reputation another. 
</P>
<P>
McNamara, 58, has managed more than 2,000 games for six different teams in the 
major leagues. He has won two division titles and helped bad teams get better. 
The Indians have exceeded expectations this year, entering Saturday night's 
game with the Seattle Mariners in third place, 4 1/2 games back in the American 
League East. 
</P>
<P>
Still, McNamara has come to be defined by one bouncing ball. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth inning of the sixth game of the 1986 World Series, a wobbly Bill 
Buckner failed to get his glove down on an equally wobbly two-hopper off the 
bat of the New York Mets' Mookie Wilson. McNamara's Red Sox were one out away 
from presenting Boston with a championship the city had coveted ravenously. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox lost. McNamara lost. A whole city lost. 
</P>
<P>
Some Bostonians blamed Buckner. More blamed McNamara. 
</P>
<P>
They said he should have replaced the gimpy Buckner with somebody who could 
move. McNamara says there is nothing to regret. But remembering is something 
different. 
</P>
<P>
"I relate that like a death in the family," McNamara said. "Being 
Irish-Catholic, you don't forget those things, but with time, you learn to live 
with them. I can always go back to that, from wherever I am. That was the low 
point." 
</P>
<P>
One out from being canonized, McNamara became vilified. The Red Sox finished in 
fifth place in 1987, and some members of the Boston media began a bilious 
campaign to oust him. They even gave it a name: "Knife the Mac." 
</P>
<P>
"It all started with the error," McNamara said. "And that's been misconstrued. 
Anybody can make an error. We won the second game of that series when (Tim) 
Teufel made an error. We lost because of a culmination of things, not one play. 
But that's all they looked at. 
</P>
<P>
"There were things written in Boston that weren't factual. We took that 
franchise and turned it around. Boston hadn't won for how long? A long time." 
</P>
<P>
McNamara was labeled surly and unapproachable. He was fired at the All-Star 
break in 1988, his managerial career having seemingly run its course. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't care if I got back in it or not," he said. "Just to take a 
managing job to have a title and the money -- I wouldn't have done it." 
</P>
<P>
He spent the 16 months between Boston and Cleveland as an advance scout for the 
Mariners. He traveled through the American League watching games from the 
stands behind home plate, a place that amounted to foreign land. His decisions 
weren't dissected under a microscope; his attitude wasn't grist for the 
public's mill. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very good sabbatical for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, nothing would have seemed complete without another chance. Boston, to be 
sure, was not a good one to end on. 
</P>
<P>
Indians president Hank Peters gave McNamara his first managing job, with 
Lewiston of the Northwest League in 1959. Thirty years later, on Nov. 3, 1989, 
Peters gave McNamara what will probably be his last. 
</P>
<P>
"You're taught never to say never," McNamara said. "But I don't see myself as 
being in any better situation. I feel I'm right where I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
As McNamara watched and scouted in 1989, Peters saw his team perform a 
late-season belly flop in the American League East. The Indians were 1 1/2 
games out of first place on Aug. 4. They finished 16 out. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got to within 1 1/2 games, I said, 'Now we'll find out what kind of 
players we have and what kind of manager we have,' " Peters said. "We found out 
two things: We had the wrong players and the wrong manager." 
</P>
<P>
Peters, the Orioles' chief engineer in the late 1970s and early '80s, fired 
manager Doc Edwards and then tidied up the clubhouse, sending discontented Joe 
Carter to San Diego and bringing in 10 new players. 
</P>
<P>
When it came to picking a manager, Peters had one simple criterion. "I was 
looking for someone who knew what it was all about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peters and McNamara are good friends, and McNamara's hiring was seen as a 
further promotion of baseball's pal-ochracy, a system that allows managers with 
full membership in the good-old-boy club to get chance after chance at the 
expense of younger men and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Frey hires Don Zimmer in Chicago. Hank Peters hires John McNamara in 
Cleveland. Baseball's business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what I was looking for," Peters said. "You can't make decisions based 
on media acceptance. You look around now, and all those people who criticized 
it are saying it wasn't such a bad move after all." 
</P>
<P>
Said McNamara: "The quickest way to get somebody fired is to hire your friends. 
Friends don't get you hired; they get you fired. I didn't solicit this job. If 
I wasn't competent, I wouldn't be here. This is a very tough, competitive 
occupation. You better be good at what you do in order to survive. If you can't 
do it, they'll find somebody else who can." 
</P>
<P>
Winning has not exactly been an institutional standard with the Indians. It has 
been 36 years since they played in a World Series, 42 since they won one. 
Success hasn't gone to anybody's head. 
</P>
<P>
McNamara says he refuses to accept tradition as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I said for me to come back to managing, it had to be a team with a chance to 
win," he said. "It had to be the right place, the right time and the right 
people." 
</P>
<P>
The intensity goes way back, to the days when, growing up on 25th and F streets 
in Sacramento, McNamara used to take a bat, a ball and his catcher's mitt to 
the park on 27th and C streets and hit himself pop-ups. For hours. 
</P>
<P>
Indians outfielder Mitch Webster calls McNamara "a quiet intense." McNamara 
calls it "presence" and says, "I could walk out there right now and get 
everyone's attention. No problem." 
</P>
<P>
One of the traditional raps against McNamara has been that he is impatient with 
young players, that he doesn't take the time to nurture budding talents and 
tender egos. He refutes the theory by first pointing to his days as the manager 
of the Oakland A's (1969-70), when he guided a team of young superstars through 
its embryonic stages. Then he points a finger at the Indians' clubhouse as 
further proof. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the rookies here," he said. "Ask them." 
</P>
<P>
Included among those rookies is catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., an uncommon talent at 
a premium position. Alomar is hitting over .300 and started in Tuesday's 
All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done everything good for me," Alomar said. "He's always helping me out. 
He's everything I could ask for. He gives me good rest when I need it." 
</P>
<P>
One by one, McNamara sets out to topple the criticisms like so many dominoes. 
He is an easy target. There have been the six teams -- tying a major-league 
mark set by Jimmie Dykes -- and the five firings. There is a career record 
under .500. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where I always get knocked," he said. "But you look at some of those 
teams. Look at the San Diego ballclub my first year there (1974). We lost 102 
games with basically an expansion team. Erase that one year and what have you 
got? Over .500. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never taken an easy job. Everything's been a challenge. Two people -- 
Dick Wagner in Cincinnati and Ray Kroc in San Diego -- said the worst decision 
they ever made was firing me." 
</P>
<P>
This is really all you need to know to understand John McNamara: 
</P>
<P>
The phone rings in his office about three hours before game time Friday night. 
It is Jim Lefebvre, the manager of the Mariners. They joke about Thursday 
night's game, a 5-4 Indians win, and make plans to meet after batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy and I have become good friends," McNamara says. "When I was working for 
them last year, I used to come down and talk to him a lot. You know, help him 
out when things weren't going well and he needed somebody. I mean, who's there 
to put an arm around the manager? ... Nobody, that's who."

Aluminum Co. of America: The Pittsburgh, Pa., firm known as Alcoa reported a 
second-quarter profit of $161.9 million, down from $285.2 million for the same 
period in 1989. Sales for the 1990 quarter were $2.69 billion, down from $2.76 
billion in 1989. Earnings reflected a 24% drop in aluminum ingot prices, lower 
fabricated product activity and a large decrease in revenue from the company's 
Brazilian affiliate as a result of that government's economic policies.

W. R. Grace &amp; Co.: The New York-based chemical company said second-quarter 
profit totaled $51.3 million, up 16% from the same period a year ago. Sales 
rose 8% to $1.6 billion. The largest operating unit of the company, Grace 
Specialty Chemicals Co., posted a 10% after-tax gain in operating income, 
helped by advances in its packaging operations business and higher sales of 
high-speed drying equipment used by the printing industry.

JACK SMITH: THEN AND NOW, WOMEN'S WORK REMAINS SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My recent review of the Ladies' Home Journal for September, 1920, has brought 
mixed reactions from both men and women. 
</P>
<P>
I concluded from the magazine that housewives in the 1920s were prisoners of 
housework and drudgery, and were besieged (by the Journal and other women's 
magazines) to buy such labor-saving machines as vacuum cleaners and washers and 
wringers so they could dress up and get out into the world. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent column Ann Landers said she had received five tubs of mail on 
housework, and found that 70% of the women claimed "they were doing 90% of the 
work around the house, plus the shopping, driving the kids around and the like, 
even though they also work outside the home." 
</P>
<P>
There is no need for me to add to those statistics, except that, in response to 
my Journal column, my readers verify that things aren't much better today. 
</P>
<P>
Juanita Matassa of Santa Ana claims that in the 1920s advertisers "invented" 
problems that their products would allegedly solve, and they are doing the same 
thing today except that they have invented new problems, such as underarm odor 
and tattle-tale gray. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Matassa denied that her mother was a drudge. "She was more free to do what 
she wanted to do when she wanted to do it and to go where she wanted to go than 
is a person who is suffering the slavery of an outside career." 
</P>
<P>
Hudson Fields of El Toro recalls the horrors of wash day in the '20s and '30s: 
"Each Monday the washing machine and surrounding washtubs on the back porch 
were filled with buckets of hot water from atop the kitchen stove. After the 
clothes were surged about in the steaming wash water, they were fished out with 
a stick and pushed into a wringer. The soapy water was squeezed back into the 
washing machine by two meshed-gear rubber rollers that were most often 
hand-cranked. The clothes dropped into a galvanized tub of hot rinse water, and 
again were passed through the repositioned wringer into the laundry basket to 
be lugged to the outside clothesline to be hung to dry. In freezing weather the 
sheets, shirts and long-handled underwear came off the line stiff and 
board-like. Then came the ironing. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I mentioned my mother's artistic yearnings, and wondered what she'd be doing 
today if she were 30. Anita Larson answers: "She would be vacuuming. She would 
be washing clothes. She would be cooking meals. She would be wondering 
wistfully about her 'yes, no' conversations with her husband. She would be 
using all that spare time, which her vacuum, washer and canned foods provided 
to develop her entrepreneurship into an income-producing career." 
</P>
<P>
Larson argues that the only equity men have helped women to achieve is the 
equal right to an earlier grave. "Now we can have an equal number of widows and 
widowers. Equity has been attained." 
</P>
<P>
"It may be we've exchanged one prison for another," says Betty-Jean Darst of 
Fullerton. "Take a look at today's women's magazines. We're expected to be 
radiantly beautiful, young-looking and sexy. Article after article tells us how 
to win and keep a man. Moreover, we're expected to have a 'career' too. 
Frankly, the 1920s may not have been a high spot for women, but I wouldn't mind 
'doing dishes for somebody's kisses.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Stransky says she was a homemaker for 20 years, but her marriage did not 
survive. She went to work and raised her children, then remarried and is a 
homemaker again. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a washing machine and a vacuum cleaner I wouldn't have been able to 
get as much sleep or go dancing on Saturday night; but floors don't mop 
themselves and we didn't have a dishwasher." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Stransky says she taught her children to mow lawns, vacuum rugs, dust 
furniture, make their beds, help with the dishes, put their dirty clothes in a 
hamper and keep their rooms clean, besides keeping the pool in chemical 
balance. (Sounds like boot camp.) 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm saying, Jack, is that no one mentions the glory of a clean house from 
the viewpoint that the caretaker has a healthy psyche!. . . . The American home 
is not a prison; it is a haven for soul-making!" 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't say that any of my correspondents agreed that homemaking is a 
glorious, soul-making experience. But I suppose many women do find some 
satisfaction in it. 
</P>
<P>
My wife probably does 90% of the housework, except that once a week we have a 
housecleaner; she takes the wash to the laundry; she cooks, she feeds the cats 
and the dog; she usually brings in the mail; she pumps gas; she does the 
gardening; she does the ironing because, she says, she likes to iron. Meanwhile 
she has a full-time administrative job. 
</P>
<P>
But I am not entirely idle; I put my dirty clothes in the hamper; I change 
light bulbs; I call the repairmen when anything breaks down; I supervise the 
pool cleaner; I buy the wine and pour it; and I turn television on and off. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, it's rather soul-making.

Die Harder, and a Lot More Often: When it comes to carnage, Bruce Willis' "Die 
Harder" is hard to beat. 
</P>
<P>
New York Times movie critic Vincent Canby made a body count, and found that 264 
people die in "Die Harder," including 230 at once during a plane wreck. That 
compares to a mere 18 in 1988's original "Die Hard." According to the Canby 
count, "Rambo III" had the second-highest number of fatalities with 106. Sam 
Peckinpah's landmark "The Wild Bunch" had 89, "Robocop II" had 81, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall" had 74 and "Rambo II" had 62. GREG BRAXTON

THE MONOLOGUE AND AUTHENTICITY OF THE BLOCKBUSTER MUSICAL STILL PACK A PUNCH,

<TEXT>
<P>
This is a confession of sorts: 
</P>
<P>
The first time I saw "A Chorus Line" -- it was a national touring version years 
ago in Chicago -- the show scarcely touched me. I thought it was too 
sentimental, a bittersweet hype about all those would-be Broadway babies of the 
chorus line whose lives seemed as insubstantial as a collection of mawkish 
sidewalk sketches. 
</P>
<P>
I could understand how the show had won an armload of Tony Awards, including 
the one for best musical. The Tony Committee has a too-healthy respect for 
smash hits, and "A Chorus Line" was nothing if not a certified box-office 
smash. But, for the life of me, I couldn't understand how it had won a Pulitzer 
Prize. 
</P>
<P>
Since then I've seen a half-dozen different stage productions of this Michael 
Bennett musical as well as Sir Richard Attenborough's unsuccessful screen 
version, and I've done a complete about-face. The more I see "A Chorus Line," 
the more it impresses me. Now I can't understand how I could have missed its 
brilliance that first time around. 
</P>
<P>
Even an amateur production of terribly uneven quality -- such as the "Chorus 
Line" that opened over the weekend at Saddleback College's McKinney Theatre -- 
can't obscure the authenticity of the material. Certain moments of deep 
emotion, let alone the witty high jinks, inevitably shine through, regardless 
of the talent on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
One such moment is a deeply affecting monologue by the character Paul, a Puerto 
Rican homosexual who recalls his innocence and his feelings of humiliation as a 
performer in a transvestite revue. The monologue can be muffed or mangled but 
is nearly impossible to eclipse. In this production -- happily -- Dexter 
Echiverri meets the challenge of the role and makes you ache for the character. 
</P>
<P>
Paul remembers dropping out of high school after being beaten up by his 
classmates. Without an education, he can't get a job until he accidentally 
lands in the revue. When his parents discover him in drag, to his horror, their 
mutual anguish is etched in Paul's memory. But the most indelible detail of his 
tormenting epiphany is that for the first time he has heard his worried father 
refer to him as "my son." 
</P>
<P>
Echiverri, who has appeared in plenty of musicals throughout the county, 
delivers Paul's monologue with a profound sense of loss that could melt the 
hardest cynic. It is too bad that he doesn't get to sing more. Echiverri 
possesses a beautiful high tenor, probably the best voice in the cast. But Paul 
has only one solo, "Who Am I Anyway?" (It seemed mystifyingly shortened in this 
production and went unlisted in the program.) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Michelle Bruce, who is just out of high school, delivers another, 
lighter aspect of the show's most wonderful material: the bawdy "Dance: Ten; 
Looks: Three," a hilarious paean to the advantages of plastic surgery for a 
Broadway chorine. Although Bruce lacks the savvy comic punch that this 
song-and-dance number calls for, she still manages to draw giddy laughter from 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
As good as the underlying material is, however, this production just doesn't 
stand up as satisfying entertainment. Except for Echiverri, none of the actors 
delineate their roles. And no backstage show about dancers -- no matter how 
well-written -- can get by without hoofers of at least minimal caliber. After 
all, virtually the entire plot of "A Chorus Line" consists of a dance audition. 
The show really needs triple threats: dancers who can sing and act. 
</P>
<P>
Out of a dozen women in the cast there is only one -- Suzi Carr George in the 
role of Cassie -- with the true aplomb of a professional dancer. She looks like 
one, carries herself like one and executes like one. Indeed, she is a dancer. 
Among the 14 men, there are none. Tom Hafner comes the closest in a small role, 
simply by making the right moves without fumbling. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the numbers, such as "At the Ballet," are almost painful to watch 
because the performers so obviously lack the precision and grace that trained 
members of any Broadway chorus would display. What seems even more astonishing 
is that a production of "A Chorus Line" in Southern California -- where body 
culture is rivaled only by car culture -- could have assembled as many unlovely 
limbs as this one. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few passable singing performances. And, miraculously, the show's 
trademark finale, "One," turns out to be watchable. Given the seemingly 
insurmountable difficulties, whoever whipped that glittering kick-line number 
into a modicum of shape deserves congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
Also, when taped music has come to be the rule rather than the exception for 
live, low-budget productions, a note of special gratitude ought to go to the 
producer and director for providing a nine-piece pit band to lend real verve to 
the score. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is no escape from the fact that this version of the classic 
musical is the sort of college staging that only family members of the cast 
could love. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Chorus Line" continues through July 28 at Saddleback College's McKinney 
Theatre, 28000 Marguerite Pkwy., Mission Viejo. Tickets: $10 to $11. 
Information: (714) 582-4656 between noon and 4 p.m. weekdays.

Bernstein Bows Out of Tour: Conductor Leonard Bernstein has canceled several 
performances in Japan due to exhaustion and lingering illness, and was escorted 
back to New York Monday by his physician, Dr. Kevin Cahill. "Leonard Bernstein 
is suffering from exhaustion as a result of trying to fulfill his professional 
obligations while not having fully recovered from several ailments he suffered 
this spring," including severe influenza, pleurisy and pneumonia, said Cahill, 
who has ordered the 71-year-old conductor to rest "for an extended period." 
Bernstein had been scheduled to conduct the London Symphony Orchestra in four 
performances in Japan. GREG BRAXTON

We Can Play These Here Guitars: Hundreds of musicians are hoping that "Rock 
Around the Clock," the Bill Haley and the Comets classic, will rock 'n' roll 
them into the record books. Up to 1,000 musicians are expected to gather in 
Gaffney, N.C., Thursday in an attempt to break the world's record for the most 
guitarists playing one song together for the longest time. The previous record 
was set in April 1989, when 532 guitarists picked out "Shake, Rattle and Roll" 
for 43 minutes in Santa Cruz, Calif. GREG BRAXTON

Stick Up for Your Rights: Virgin Records will begin implementing its own brand 
of warning label for rock records starting in August -- a pro-First Amendment 
sticker. Jeff Ayeroff, Virgin's co-managing director, told The Times Monday 
that all Virgin Records albums, tapes and CDs will feature an anti-censorship 
label that reads: "The First Amendment gives you the right to choose what you 
hear, what you say and what you think. 
</P>
<P>
CENSORSHIP IS UNAMERICAN. Don't let anyone take away that right. Raise your 
political voice. Register to vote." Ayeroff said that Virgin will also make the 
label available to artists at other companies. Boogie Down Productions, a rap 
group that records for RCA, is slated to be the first outside artist to use the 
new sticker, he said. GREG BRAXTON

NORRINGTON'S BEETHOVEN FEST EXPLORES THE MISSA SOLEMNIS; 
</P>
<P>
FESTIVAL: THE CONDUCTOR LED THE SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY IN A DIDACTIC YET 
EXULTANT CELEBRATION OF THE DIFFICULT MASTERWORK.

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The intersection of art and education is a notoriously accident-prone 
crossroads. The almost inevitable crash between the extremes of popularizing 
platitudes and intuitive mysteries is seldom pretty to witness. 
</P>
<P>
Given the inherent perils, the Beethoven Discovery Weekend that closed the 12th 
annual Beethoven Festival in San Francisco this year proved a surprisingly 
enlivening and enlightening event. Little pedantry, much wit and even some 
inspired music-making were invested in an exploration of the grandeur and 
subtlety of the Missa Solemnis, a.k.a. the Mass in D. 
</P>
<P>
The festival leader was Roger Norrington. In the last few years, the 
56-year-old English conductor has graduated from the relative obscurity of Kent 
Opera to unlikely eminence atop the period-practice school, with a major in 
Beethoven and a minor in proselytizing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Norrington and his London Classical Players presented a "Haydn 
Experience," followed by weekends devoted to Beethoven and Berlioz. Last 
summer, they took the Beethoven show -- centered on the Ninth Symphony -- to 
Summerfare in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Norrington's weekend-long "experiences" are baptisms by total immersion into 
the historical and artistic context of a major work, extending the typical 
pre-concert lecture to a point just short of an undergraduate course in music 
appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
The pillars of the San Francisco weekend were under the direct guidance of 
Norrington -- a concert of Missa Solemnis antecedents Friday, an open rehearsal 
of the Mass Saturday, and the culminating performance Sunday. In between were 
three miniconcerts and four lectures, all in Davies Symphony Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The sessions got off to a soft start, didactically at least. The excerpts by 
composers ranging from Palestrina to Cherubini were left largely to acquire 
significance by association, as Norrington's remarks Friday were seldom 
specific or memorably stated. 
</P>
<P>
But the performances included some gems, with the heroes the obviously 
well-drilled and enthusiastic San Francisco Symphony Chorus. The singers 
launched the evening with bright-toned and finely spun lyricism in the Kyrie 
from Beethoven's own, earlier Mass in C. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra had overtures by Beethoven and Mozart to itself, revealing 
generally crisp, balanced and energized playing, though the finale to the 
"Pastoral" Symphony sounded skittish. Norrington kept the singers and orchestra 
firmly pointed forward, seldom giving the attention to releases that he gave to 
entrances. 
</P>
<P>
Norrington also showed a stubbornly 19th-Century interpretation of the Kyrie 
from Palestrina's Missa "Assumpta est Maria," keeping it square and metrically 
insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
Baritone John Cheek contributed a rich "For behold, darkness shall cover the 
earth" and soprano Amanda Halgrimson a radiant "Come unto Him," in German and 
in Mozart's arrangements, which is how Beethoven knew "Messiah." 
</P>
<P>
In the Saturday rehearsal, Norrington nurtured his audience with pertinent and 
engaging remarks. He seemed much more relaxed, and gave easily understood 
demonstrations of specific points in the score. 
</P>
<P>
He also elicited strong cooperation from his musicians in the bits-and-pieces 
approach. Mezzo Janice Taylor and tenor John Aler joined Halgrimson and Cheek 
as a reasonably unified, but remote-sounding, solo quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Halgrimson gave a limpid, textually connected account of 
Beethoven's "Gellert" Lieder -- minus some verses -- though their relevance for 
the Missa was never made clear. 
</P>
<P>
Her sensitive accompanist was Helene Wickett. The pianist made a clear, 
understated case for the poignant power of Beethoven's A-flat Sonata, Opus 110 
-- which does connect with the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Kagan of Hunter College introduced the social circumstances surrounding 
the creation of the Missa Solemnis with a dry lecture on Beethoven and his 
patron the Archduke Rudolph. Michael Steinberg, the versatile program annotator 
for the San Francisco Symphony, provided a wise and funny guide to points of 
musical interest in the work itself. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning came the final contextual elements. Art historian Patrick 
Werkner gave a fascinating look at the iconography of the myth of Beethoven. 
The Aurora String Quartet -- all members of the orchestra -- probed the Opus 
132 Quartet with utmost refinement and seriousness, and Steinberg provided an 
emotional summation. 
</P>
<P>
These preliminaries left a large, though far from capacity, audience primed for 
the emotionally exhausting, sublime complexities of the Missa. Sunday 
afternoon, Norrington satisfied the demand he helped create with a limber, 
dramatic, exultant account of the notoriously difficult masterwork. 
</P>
<P>
This was Norrington's first "experience" without the London Classical Players. 
But however much he might prefer period instruments and practices in the 
orchestra, on the podium he is another Leonard Bernstein, dancing and miming in 
the grand manner little relevant to the way this music was originally 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
Fronting the San Francisco Symphony -- slightly reduced in strings -- and the 
large chorus, his extroverted display did not seem as incongruous as it might 
at the helm of a period-instrument band. In any case, at the end of a 19-day 
festival with the San Franciscans, he had them playing with much of the taut 
clarity associated with antiquarian orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
Norrington's Missa Solemnis retains all of the majesty and mystery of a work 
still more honored in textbooks than performances. (Both Norrington and the 
Missa will be with us next season, though not together: the English conductor 
will lead his orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic in concerts at the 
Music Center and the Orange County Performing Arts Center, while the Missa 
Solemnis opens the Los Angeles Master Chorale season.) 
</P>
<P>
The propulsive, always musically motivated pace for which Norrington's 
Beethoven is noted was a constant, conspicuous factor. Less expected was the 
devoted tenderness and lyric simplicity that he revealed in the Sanctus and 
Benedictus, and the sheer revelry of the Dona nobis pacem, powerfully 
contrasted with the harrowing intimations of war. 
</P>
<P>
Norrington drew an impressive lot of focused, balanced sound from the eager 
choristers. They delivered maximal clarity in the great fugues, where 
Norrington tellingly stressed dance rhythms rather than polyphonic 
pontification. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra gave good weight in the hushed sections, and rushed along lithely 
when launched on the meteoric openings of the Gloria and Credo. Concertmaster 
Raymond Kobler soared eloquently in the Benedictus, heading the list of assured 
orchestral soloists. 
</P>
<P>
The solo quartet sounded better in concert than in the pseudo-rehearsal. They 
proved strong enough to emerge with operatic pathos in the war-torn parts of 
the Agnus Dei, and sensitive enough to keep their essential but often 
self-effacing parts well integrated into the overall texture.

DAMASCUS, Syria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old man in the red fez, a fresh rosebud and the ribbon of the French Legion 
of Honor pinned to his lapel, leaned across his desk and spoke slowly and 
emphatically about a dark and dramatic chapter in Syrian history. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a movement in the country, in Aleppo and Hama, but it seemed to have 
no general aim," he said crisply, despite his 87 years, analyzing the events of 
1980. "Was it to change the government? If that's true, where were the people 
to take over?" 
</P>
<P>
In the two northern cities, the souks, the big markets that form the heart and 
mind of an Arab business community, had been forced to shut down by government 
opponents. Resistance to the regime of President Hafez Assad was mounting, led 
by the powerful and secretive Muslim Brotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Here in Damascus, there were rumors," recalled Badr Shallah, then, as now, 
chairman of the Federation of Syrian Chambers of Commerce -- a man who has been 
a power in Damascus for so long that his mailing address is simply P.O. Box 1. 
The shop owners were nervous. They expected there would be trouble if they 
stayed open. They wanted Shallah's advice. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them to go to their shops at the normal opening time, roll up the 
shutters halfway and wait," the old man went on. " 'If there is trouble, close 
up. You have the right. If there's is none, we stay in business.' " 
</P>
<P>
There was none, and the support of the Damascus business community, the 
merchants of the souks, may have saved Assad's government. 
</P>
<P>
"To shut down would have brought harm to this country and this city," Shallah 
insisted, recounting his role, which Assad hailed as a "nationalist stand," in 
the drama that closed with grim finality two years later. The resistance forces 
rose up against Assad's army at Hama and were crushed without mercy. As many as 
20,000 may have been killed, and bulldozers brought down the city on top of 
their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. policy-makers want to know how their proposals will play on Wall Street; 
Arab leaders check the pulse of the souks. Both institutions, although widely 
dissimilar, are the best bets for a quick read. Politicians curry their 
support. 
</P>
<P>
The open streets of modern Arab capitals are lined with air-conditioned, 
fixed-price shops in the Western style, but the stifling confines of the souks 
touch the soul of the Middle East, the crossroads between Europe and Asia. The 
merchants sit in the doorways of their shops, trading bits of news with their 
morning regulars. In upstairs storerooms, cartons of goods stand waiting for 
the chance of profit. 
</P>
<P>
Import-export agents, traders and the traditional Middle East business leaders 
whose families have been in commerce for generations have not been budged by 
the growing influence of government-sheltered industrialists and 
Western-trained experts with advanced degrees in business administration. They 
deal in cash, on their reputations, and they form an economic fraternity that 
carries weight in high places. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of money generated down in the souks," said a Western diplomat 
who has been based in Damascus for two years. "They're hole-in-the-wall shops, 
but the owners have magnificent homes. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of big businessmen you can identify. They have pan-Arab connections and 
run hotel chains, that sort of thing. But they're no bigger than men like 
Shallah," whose family grain business, staffed with sons and nephews, operates 
from unpretentious headquarters on a downtown street, next to a radio repair 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
In Syria, the private sector controls 25% of the economy -- the healthy part. 
Industry, as in most big Middle Eastern countries, is state-owned and 
inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
Shallah said no figures are kept on the percentage of the private economy 
handled through the 8,000 dues-paying companies and individuals of his 
federation, nor on what percentage deals exclusively through the souks. But the 
federation is the main voice of the private business owner. 
</P>
<P>
When the commercial community or individual merchants want to complain to 
Assad, Shallah and his aides carry the message. 
</P>
<P>
"And 90% of the petitions are granted," the aged business leader said. "After 
all, I have long experience with the chamber" -- he joined the board in 1946 -- 
"and I am older than the president." 
</P>
<P>
"Souk" is a transliteration of the Arabic word for "market." It is less 
familiar in the Western world than the Persian equivalent, bazaar, or the 
general North African term for a city's old quarter, casbah. But by any name, 
these traditional marketplaces of the Middle East whirl with activity, gossip 
and sometimes intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
For tourists they are the place: the smell of spices, the glitter of gold and 
brass, folds of Oriental fabrics and a brush with ethnicity and history not 
provided by the antiseptic shops of uptown hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Each has a special character. For example: 
</P>
<P>
The coffee shops and dauntless touts of Cairo's Khan al Khalili, whose peddlers 
push T-shirts bearing the words that travelers hear but don't believe: "No 
Problem." 
</P>
<P>
Al Hamidieh's vaulted iron roof here in Damascus, so pitted with rusted holes 
that it twinkles with starlight at midday. 
</P>
<P>
Istanbul's great covered bazaar, the Kapali Carsi, reputed to enclose more than 
7,000 shops, ateliers, stalls and storehouses in a labyrinthine layout that 
tests visitors' confidence that they will ever emerge. 
</P>
<P>
David Street and the Arab Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem, where shoppers 
risk injury if they ignore the shouted warnings of porters hurtling down the 
narrow lanes with wheeled carts of bouncing goods. 
</P>
<P>
The characterless character of Baghdad's new souk, President Saddam Hussein's 
monument to secular efficiency in Iraq: glass skylights, cobble-less 
passageways, spotless to a fault. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the market was one of the twin axes of the Muslim town, the other 
being the main mosque, where townspeople gathered for Friday prayers. In a 
sense, the market served the faithful, being laid out in a ranked pattern that 
placed sellers of books, paper and other items for the learned nearest the holy 
place and more ordinary goods farther from its walls. 
</P>
<P>
In Damascus today, the souks adjoin the great 7th-Century Umayyad Mosque. One 
souk, the Madhat Bacha, whose merchants sell inexpensive fabrics to rural 
shoppers, stands atop the old Roman Via Recta, St. Paul's "Street Called 
Straight." 
</P>
<P>
Cairo's Khan al Khalili stands in front of the 10th-Century Al Azhar Mosque, a 
renowned seat of Islamic learning. The combination of mosque and merchant -- 
the two institutions closest to the people -- remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
Big cities have a variety of traditional markets, delineated by trade: a gold 
souk, a carpet souk, a women's clothing souk with a lingerie "sub-souk." Many 
are roofed, or at least swathed in shadow by the narrowness of the lanes. Most 
were built in the past few centuries, when the Ottoman Turks ruled in the 
Middle East, and the columns and ceiling vaults are often sculpted with Islamic 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
Some souks, like the Khan al Khalili, perhaps the best known to Westerners, are 
devoted to the tourist trade. Coppersmiths hammer out bowls and trays in the 
lanes outside their shops. Jewelers -- credit cards accepted -- turn out 
trinkets in gold and silver, including the popular cartouche bearing the 
tourist's name in Pharaonic hieroglyphics. Somewhere in the bowels of the souk 
is Cairo's most popular caftan couturier. 
</P>
<P>
The reputations of many markets are based on their specialties. In Dubai, 
computers, stereos and other imported electronic gear are the No. 1 tickets. 
For fabrics, it's Damascus. Although the silks of China have been replaced by 
the polyesters of South Korea in the markets here and in other Arab capitals, 
the exotic damask cloth of Syria continues a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
All the souks, locals and diplomats say, are patrolled by plainclothes police 
officers on the lookout for political intelligence, contraband and illegal 
money-changers -- or a payoff for ignoring such activities. 
</P>
<P>
The farther from tourist influence, the more prosaic the souk. In Tehran, the 
main bazaar resembles a giant, rumpled K-Mart. It is Iran's grocer, hardware 
store, clothing merchant and emporium of kitchen appliances. Almost as an 
afterthought, it seems to a Western visitor, shops and stalls offer the 
carpets, jewelry and handicrafts that bedazzle tourists elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But there is nothing mundane about the influence of Tehran's merchants, the 
bazaari. In the late 1970s, when the reign of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi hung 
in the balance, the bazaari were courted by both the monarchy and the 
fundamentalist forces of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. They made their 
decision, as souk merchants anywhere in the Middle East would have, on 
pragmatic economic grounds. A decade later, it is not clear whether they made 
the right choice. 
</P>
<P>
The bazaari had prospered under the shah and the economic boom that accompanied 
his last decade in power. But they also had grievances, including a seeming 
demotion to second-class business owners under the Western-oriented industrial 
elite that flourished in those years. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the historical relationship between the souk and the mosque was 
still strong in Iran, and when the mullahs preached revolution, the bazaari 
listened. They shut down their shops during the pivotal anti-shah 
demonstrations of 1978, loosening the clay under his feet. 
</P>
<P>
Shaul Bakhash, an Iranian journalist and author who now lives in the United 
States, noted in his book "The Reign of the Ayatollahs": 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The bazaar merchants were acting out of mixed motives. They resented 
their loss of status, competition from domestic industries and what they 
perceived as excessive concentration of economic power in the hands of a few. . 
. . They could not conceive that in the eyes of the poor, they too could appear 
as the privileged material beneficiaries of the shah's economic policies. . . . 
They hardly foresaw that private commerce, as well as industry, would be 
threatened by the revolutionary tide." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the ayatollahs' regime has been shaken by economic hard times. Iranians 
are panicked by inflation. It is the No. 1 topic in the bazaar, where rumor and 
politics share space with kettles and rugs.

HIGH MEDICAL COSTS ADD TO ILLS OF POOR, HEALTH SYSTEM

<TEXT>
<P>
As a 25-year-old first-year graduate student in communications, Brigett 
McDaniel was diagnosed two years ago as having sarcoidosis, a life-imperiling 
disease that causes abnormal growths in various parts of the body. 
</P>
<P>
One such growth was on one of her lungs. Although it was benign, doctors warned 
her that it could turn malignant at any time. Yet McDaniel decided not to 
undergo the recommended operation. 
</P>
<P>
The reason was simple: She didn't have the money. Her husband, unemployed at 
the time, carried no insurance, and McDaniel's insurance from school covered 
only one-third of her bills. 
</P>
<P>
"It was at this point that I stopped seeing the private physician," she told a 
Senate subcommittee recently, "because his fee was between $250 to $400 per 
visit, and I couldn't afford it." 
</P>
<P>
Millions of Americans face the same predicament. While this nation boasts of 
the world's highest quality medical care, studies show, it is financially out 
of reach for a mounting number of families. 
</P>
<P>
Health care in the United States is a story of poverty amid plenty. 
</P>
<P>
Americans spent an extraordinary $540 billion on health care in 1988, the most 
recent period for which government figures are available. That was more than 
double what they had laid out just eight years ago and represented 11.1% of the 
nation's entire economic output. 
</P>
<P>
No other industrial nation spent such a large share of its wealth for health 
care. And in no other industrial nation has health care spending been rising so 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
So expensive has medical care become that millions of Americans are denied it. 
Experts have no way of pinpointing exact numbers of those without health 
insurance, given the diversity and mobility of the population. But the Ford 
Foundation estimates that between 31 million and 37 million Americans have no 
private health insurance and do not get Medicaid benefits. Most of these people 
do not have pockets deep enough to cover the cost of the health care they need. 
</P>
<P>
And beyond the uninsured are countless millions of others who have had to 
accept less than first-class medical care because their insurance provides 
nothing better, according to the Ford Foundation, a private nonprofit 
corporation that is active in and funds scientific, educational and charitable 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Of the uninsured, about 24 million are employed workers or their spouses and 
children. And, despite a popular belief that the indigent are covered by the 
federal-state program known as Medicaid, there are 11 million Americans below 
the poverty line who have no health insurance, Ford Foundation and federal 
figures show. 
</P>
<P>
From these roots spreads a thicket of additional problems. Big-city hospitals 
are so crowded that critically ill people are sometimes denied admission 
because there is no room to treat them. Thirteen of the 18 private hospitals in 
Los Angeles County have dropped out of the county's trauma care system because 
emergency room patients suffering severe trauma are frequently uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
Black men in Harlem can expect to live a shorter life than the impoverished 
citizens of Bangladesh. The U.S. infant mortality rate -- a prime indicator of 
the nation's health care access -- exceeds 10 per 1,000. In a U.N. survey of 22 
industrial nations, the United States ranked 20th, only slightly better than 
Israel and Greece. 
</P>
<P>
The well-to-do catch the ricochet. Because hospitals and doctors have no hope 
of collecting from poor, uninsured patients, they compensate by charging more 
to those who can pay. The rebound has become a significant cause of rising 
health costs for those who can pay and for the companies that insure them. 
</P>
<P>
The ailment has a cure. Karen Davis, chairman of the Health Policy and 
Management Department at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, wrote recently 
that society is facing a fork in the road. 
</P>
<P>
"Either a basic societal commitment will be made to ensure access to health 
care for all," she said, "or we risk a nation that is increasingly divided into 
the cared-for and the neglected -- with the consequent toll in human suffering, 
loss of life and economic productivity, and diminished social solidarity." 
</P>
<P>
Such a commitment would cost money -- lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepper Commission -- named for the late Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.) -- 
whose members were appointed by Congress and former President Ronald Reagan, 
recently called for an ambitious program to provide health insurance coverage 
for all citizens. The price tag: $66 billion a year in federal funds and $20 
billion in private financing. The commission ducked the obvious question; it 
did not suggest how the public money should be generated. 
</P>
<P>
A more modest proposal by the Ford Foundation last year would oblige employers 
either to provide health insurance for their workers or to contribute to a 
public fund for uninsured workers. The cost would be covered by $22 billion a 
year from employers, $3 billion from employees and $2 billion from the federal 
government. In addition, Medicaid coverage would be extended to the rest of the 
uninsured poor at a cost of $3 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has rejected both proposals as too costly. In Congress, 
which would have to legislate any such programs, the issue is dormant. 
</P>
<P>
Existing federal health insurance programs have proved a blessing for their 
beneficiaries, but at enormous cost. Federal health-care programs already 
consume more than $150 billion a year and account for $1 of every $8 that the 
government spends. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare alone, which insures the elderly, costs nearly $100 billion a year. 
Without it and Social Security, the Ford Foundation says, almost half of all 
elderly Americans would live in poverty; at present, only 12% do. 
</P>
<P>
Medicaid, at a cost of $40 billion a year, provides a safety net for 22 million 
poor people, according to Health Care Financing Administration figures. But 
most states extend Medicaid coverage only to the minimum required by Washington 
-- recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children and of the 
Supplemental Security Income program for the blind and disabled poor. An intact 
family with an employed worker -- regardless of how low the household income -- 
usually has trouble qualifying. In California, as in Illinois, such families 
qualify only if the worker has recently lost a job. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the record of the past decade is one of federal program cuts, 
not expansions. Medicare and Medicaid benefits were largely untouched during 
that period, although Medicare reimbursements to hospitals and doctors were 
trimmed and states were forced to pay a greater share of Medicaid costs. But at 
the urging of then-President Reagan, Congress made substantial cuts in smaller 
programs to assist community-based health-care providers such as those that 
popped up in rural areas and inner cities during the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"The result has been a marked slowdown in further improvements in . . . the 
health of the poor and mounting evidence of a deterioration in access to 
health-care services," Davis of Johns Hopkins wrote. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that the years from 
1982 to 1986 "witnessed a reversal in the trends over several prior decades of 
improving access to health services for low-income groups." 
</P>
<P>
To discover how America's poor now receive their health care, a visit to 
Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital, operated by Fulton and DeKalb counties, is 
instructive. On one recent afternoon, the long and cramped corridor in the 
basement was lined two-deep with more than two dozen men, women and children, 
some bleeding, some moaning, some sleeping. Some sat on the floor; others were 
in wheelchairs and on gurneys. Many had been there for hours and would remain 
for hours longer. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Anderson, supervisor of the hospital's emergency room, said that about 800 
persons a day are treated there. Many of them are poor people who go to the 
hospital, where the service is free and relatively quick, for routine care. 
"They know they've got ease of access to care at this hospital," Anderson 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
"Emergency rooms are not used just for emergencies today," said Anderson, whose 
father is director of the Los Angeles County Hospital emergency room. "They're 
used for convenience. This is true for any department, about 15% true 
emergencies, maybe another 35% what I call urgencies and the rest are 
conveniences." 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, Hamilton Holmes, the hospital's affable medical administrator, said 
that the institution has grown so crowded that it has to turn patients away. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a significant number of people who are making, say, $10,000 or $20,000 
that just cannot afford to take out health insurance that come to Grady for 
their medical care," Holmes said. "It's a significant problem to try to 
maintain quality health care for people who are not paying anything." 
</P>
<P>
It is a far graver problem for the poor themselves. For the Hoffman family of 
Jennings, Mo., medical disaster turned into financial disaster last year. 
</P>
<P>
Seven-year-old Eddy Hoffman, struck by lightning in his own back yard last 
July, was left with severe burns over more than half of his body. He is now an 
invalid requiring constant care and life-support systems at home. 
</P>
<P>
His parents, Edward and Paige Hoffman, were both employed when their son was 
crippled, he as the manager of his own vending machine company and she as a 
part-time hairdresser and waitress. But they had no health insurance. A trust 
fund set up by the Jennings police department paid almost $15,000 of Eddy's 
bills. The Hoffmans expect never to be able to pay all the rest, which may 
climb to more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Hoffman, who had to give up his job so that he could spend more time 
with his ailing son, now works only part time with another vending machine 
company. Paige Hoffman quit working entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have been unable to afford health insurance," Paige Hoffman told a 
Senate subcommittee recently. "When and if we are able to afford it, it's 
doubtful that we'll ever be able to insure Eddy." 
</P>
<P>
For the Baretta family of Oak Grove, Mo., financial disaster struck in the form 
of an illness, not an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Baretta, now 39, lost his job as an auto worker soon after his 3-month-old 
son, Jason, was diagnosed as epileptic 11 years ago. And with his job, Neal 
Baretta lost his health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"We went out and tried to find an insurance company that would cover my son for 
his disability," Baretta said before the same subcommittee. "They told us no 
way." 
</P>
<P>
In the years that followed, Jason accumulated medical bills of about $40,000. 
Fortunately for Baretta, most of this gigantic sum was paid by a Missouri 
program that helps low-income families with medical emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Now Baretta and his wife work full time, but neither employer provides health 
insurance. For $240 a month, they have purchased a private policy that covers 
them and their daughter. But they cannot find an insurer willing to cover Jason 
-- at any cost. 
</P>
<P>
So now the family tries to keep Jason sheltered, for fear that he will suffer 
some injury that could seriously hurt him and financially destroy the family. 
</P>
<P>
"Jason is 11 now," said Baretta, "and he wants to do what 11-year-old boys 
would like to do -- play baseball, play football, soccer, ride a skateboard. He 
can't because he doesn't have any insurance. How do you tell an 11-year-old boy 
that he can't do normal things?" 
</P>
<P>
What has happened to the Hoffmans and the Barettas is happening nationally to 
groups that cannot afford proper health care. Consider, for example, the 
collective health of the nation's blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Mortality rates are significantly higher for middle-aged blacks than whites. 
Mac W. Otten, an epidemiologist at the national Centers for Disease Control in 
Atlanta, determined that income disparities between blacks and whites accounted 
for 38% of the difference. Other factors included blacks' higher incidence of 
high blood pressure, smoking, obesity and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
Colin McCord and Harold P. Freeman, doctors at Harlem Hospital in New York, 
recently analyzed 1979 and 1980 death certificates at the hospital, which is 
located in a neighborhood where 96% of the residents are black and 41% live 
below the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
"Black men in Harlem," they concluded, "were less likely to reach the age of 65 
than men in Bangladesh." Most fatal diseases, including heart disease, 
cirrhosis of the liver, cancer and drugs, struck blacks at an earlier age than 
whites, they found. 
</P>
<P>
"Harlem is extreme, but it is not an isolated phenomenon," the doctors wrote in 
the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Today's system of paying for health care gets bad marks nationally. In a recent 
Los Angeles Times poll, 55% of the respondents called for "fundamental 
overhauling" of the system. Nearly one in four said that they had denied 
themselves health care treatment for fear that they could not afford it. Almost 
half said that they could not afford care if they became critically ill. 
</P>
<P>
The weight of public opinion has not been lost on federal policy-makers. 
President Bush has appointed an interagency task force to study proposals for 
improving health care. Constance J. Horner, undersecretary of health and human 
services, leads a team studying what she called "every conceivable option." 
</P>
<P>
But Horner made clear in a recent interview that, at least in President Bush's 
view, not every option is conceivable. The task force, she said, has ruled out 
universal health insurance provided by the government for those who are 
otherwise uninsured. Nor, she said, will it approve mandatory employer-provided 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"This Administration is not well disposed towards national health insurance 
proposals," Horner said. "We want to find ways that are both humane and 
economical." 
</P>
<P>
Others have advanced more sweeping proposals. The American Medical Assn. 
recently called for a costly package that would require businesses to provide 
medical insurance to all workers, expand health care for the poor and limit 
malpractice lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the nation's largest corporations, including Ford Motor Corp., American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph and Eastman Kodak, have joined with some of the 
largest labor unions to create the National Leadership Coalition for Health 
Care Reform. Organized labor long has called for national health insurance and 
some corporate leaders, watching worriedly as their health-care benefit 
packages have consumed an increasing share of their profits, have joined 
labor's call for greater federal involvement in health care. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a greater degree of concern now than ever before that there is a need 
for radical change in the nation's health care system," said Bert Seidman, the 
AFL-CIO's health policy director. 
</P>
<P>
Edna del Weinel, head of Family Care Center, a 1960s-era store-front community 
clinic that treats a predominantly working-class clientele in St. Louis, is 
more direct and more pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not had a way to bring our society face to face with the fact that all 
citizens have a right to primary health care," she said, her voice carrying the 
timbre of hammer on nail. "There isn't the will at the top to bring anything 
about for the health of poor, working people. What kind of country do we have?"

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid talk of historic change and the start of a new epoch, Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday swept 
away the final major barriers to German unification. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev agreed to accept a united Germany as a full member of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the leaders reached agreement on a range of 
other key issues that are likely to influence the Continent's future for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether we like it or not, the time will come when a united Germany will be in 
NATO if that is its choice," Gorbachev said in response to questions after the 
agreement was read by Kohl at a joint news conference. "Then, if that is the 
choice, to some degree and in some form, it can work together with the Soviet 
Union." 
</P>
<P>
It was a performance that surprised even their closest aides and left political 
analysts once again underestimating the pace of events driving Europe forward. 
</P>
<P>
And once again it was the 59-year-old Soviet president at the center of it all. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now leaving an epoch in the development of international relations and 
entering another era," Gorbachev told the news conference in this north 
Caucasus spa town. "I hope it will be a long and peaceful one." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a breakthrough, a fantastic result," Kohl told West German television 
after the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Two days of intensive talks between Kohl and Gorbachev, frequently only with 
note-takers and interpreters present, brought the following breakthroughs: 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev swept aside the worries of his domestic political opponents and 
agreed to a united Germany's membership in the Western military alliance. His 
acceptance met a key demand of both East and West Germany and of NATO itself. 
</P>
<P>
The two also agreed to negotiate a treaty for the withdrawal within three to 
four years of the 360,000 Soviet troops stationed in East Germany. The 
withdrawal period, shorter than most observers had anticipated, is considered 
the fastest feasible time frame for pulling out those forces, which constitute 
the Soviet Union's largest single concentration of military strength outside 
its borders. 
</P>
<P>
Western military forces, however -- including U.S. troops -- can remain in 
Berlin during the withdrawal period. West German officials said the Western 
military presence in Berlin during this period was a point that the United 
States specifically wanted. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and other NATO forces in what is now West Germany will remain, German 
officials stressed. "The American forces will stay, that's no problem at all," 
Kohl adviser Horst Teltschik said. 
</P>
<P>
In return for these Soviet concessions, Kohl declared that a united Germany 
will renounce nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and limit its future 
military strength to 370,000 personnel. The limit will be formalized at the 
signing of an arms reduction treaty, expected in November. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl said a united Germany will pay at least part of the costs of sending home 
the Soviet forces, which have been on German territory since the final months 
of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The West German chancellor also said that during the Soviet withdrawal period, 
no NATO forces, either West German or those of a third country, will be 
stationed in the area that is now East Germany. Instead, members of a united 
German territorial army will be positioned there. 
</P>
<P>
Once all Soviet forces are gone, however, regular, NATO-integrated German army 
units can be moved into the region, he said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, in a statement released at the White House, praised Gorbachev: 
"This comment demonstrates statesmanship and strengthens efforts to build 
enduring relationships based on cooperation. We think this solution is in the 
best interests of all the countries of Europe, including the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
NATO, in a statement from Brussels, also praised Gorbachev's acceptance of a 
unified Germany as a member of the Western alliance. It said such membership 
"will increase stability for all . . . including the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the agreement is "the 
right development for all of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who was traveling from Washington for talks about German unification 
with the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, France, Britain, Poland and the 
two Germanys, was taken by surprise by the accord. He first learned of it from 
news accounts. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that he had long anticipated Soviet agreement to NATO 
membership for a unified Germany and that "the only surprise is that it 
happened in July rather than August or September." Baker added that some points 
of the agreement leave room for interpretation. "I think we ought to reserve 
judgment on the details of the pact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev agreed that negotiations on the external aspects of German 
unification under way between the two Germanys and the four victorious World 
War II powers should be completed in time to present the results to a 
conference of all European nations that is scheduled for Nov. 19-21 in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Those talks, known as the "two-plus-four" talks, will also negotiate an end to 
the remaining rights of the four victorious powers in both Germanys and in the 
old German capital, Berlin, where they are still sovereign. 
</P>
<P>
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher is expected to brief his 
East German counterpart, Markus Meckel, and the three allied foreign ministers, 
including Baker, today in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Referring frequently to the bitter history of war between the two nations, 
Gorbachev and Kohl also agreed to conclude a treaty that would set the basis of 
political, economic and cultural relations between Moscow and a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl said he and Gorbachev had "talked intensively" on economic and technical 
assistance for the Soviet Union, but he also stressed that such aid would most 
likely come in the form of multilateral aid from the West rather than from 
Germany on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly at Kohl's urging, leaders of the 12-nation European Community and at 
last week's Group of Seven economic summit in Houston buried their doubts and 
agreed to study possible aid to support Gorbachev's reforms, aimed at 
implementing a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in the common interest that the policy of perestroika succeed," Kohl 
said. "It serves democracy in the Soviet Union but also the development of 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
There will be negotiations between the Soviet Union and many Western forums. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to help Mikhail Gorbachev during this interim period," Kohl added, 
describing such support as "a considerable contribution to peace." 
</P>
<P>
Both men spoke of a historic moment, and Kohl specifically referred to the 
suffering in both nations from the war that Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler launched 
on the world 51 years ago next September. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kohl: "We undertook this task as a special duty of our generation, which 
consciously experienced the war and its results but which now has the great and 
possibly unique chance to shape the future of our countries and our continents 
for a long time in peace, security and freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's willingness to accept a unified Germany in NATO followed a dizzying 
variety of Soviet proposals, including German neutrality and membership in both 
NATO and the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
While Gorbachev and his foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, came to 
realize the benefits of a Germany bound tightly within a stable alliance, 
conservative opponents within the Soviet military and the Communist Party 
resisted. In recent weeks, the diplomatic task for the West had become one of 
providing the Soviet leader with a package that he could then get past 
reluctant conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Gorbachev defended his decision, citing the NATO alliance's offer of 
a declaration of nonaggression to Warsaw Pact member states and the agreed 
ceiling on German troop strengths as two important steps that led to the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"We must not forget the times in which we live," said Gorbachev, taking note of 
the conventional arms talks nearing agreement in Vienna.

SCHOOL BOARD PICKS LATINO TO SUCCEED BRITTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William R. Anton, a 38-year veteran of the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
on Monday was named superintendent, succeeding the man who beat him to the top 
job just three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education voted 6 to 1 to make Anton the first Latino to head the 
610,000-student district. The former deputy superintendent will earn the same 
salary -- $164,555 -- as Leonard Britton, who announced last week he would 
leave when his contract expired in June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But after a day-long closed-door session, the board voted 5 to 2, with board 
members Jackie Goldberg and Julie Korenstein dissenting, to buy out Britton's 
contract. His last day will be Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein cast the only vote against hiring Anton, saying she was angry that 
the board had awarded him a three-year contract (with a provision for a review 
after two years) without considering other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Estimating the buyout of Britton's contract could cost more than $225,000 when 
details are finalized, Korenstein said she deplored the way the decision was 
"railroaded through." 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Slavkin, one of four board members elected since Britton's hiring, 
said he was "excited" about Anton, calling him "the best choice." 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin added that he felt the three-year contract was important to give Anton 
a chance to "turn this district around" and to show the board's confidence in 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Anton, who began his career as a teacher at Rowan Avenue Elementary School in 
1952, said his greatest assets are a willingness to work hard, a commitment to 
children, a thorough knowledge of the district and the communities it serves 
and his ability to work with people. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also an optimist . . . I've heard we're adrift, but I do not believe 
that," he said. "We have very capable people, and if we focus on what is best 
for our children," many of the district's problems can be solved. 
</P>
<P>
Anton said he considers the size of the district, the second largest in the 
nation, an asset and will work to defeat proposals to break it up. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first acts Monday was to phone United Teachers-Los Angeles President 
Helen Bernstein to offer to work with her. 
</P>
<P>
But he said it has not been decided yet whether he, like Britton, will have a 
bodyguard-chauffeur. That was one of the union's favorite examples of what it 
called administrative extravagance. 
</P>
<P>
Anton's selection marks a return to the district's long tradition of finding 
superintendents from within its own ranks. 
</P>
<P>
The change at the top comes during a pivotal year for the district, which plans 
to put all schools on a year-round calendar by next summer. The district is 
also wrestling with deepening financial problems while beginning to change the 
ways schools are run and hoping to improve student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the politically sensitive mix is the fact that the three-year 
contract with the teachers' union expires next June, shortly after four of the 
seven board members face reelection. 
</P>
<P>
One of two deputy superintendents passed over three years ago in favor of 
Britton, Anton, who will be 66 next week, had announced last November that he 
would retire at the end of the current school year. His change of heart a month 
later fueled speculation he expected to be offered the top job. 
</P>
<P>
Anton at the time would say only that he was urged to stay by Britton and by 
board members Rita Walters and Leticia Quezada -- both of whom have been 
critical of Britton. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Anton said nothing "had been promised or even suggested" at the time 
he rescinded his retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
When the board brought Britton, from the top schools post in Miami, it was 
criticized for not picking a Latino or a black to head the huge district, in 
which students are about 85% minority. Latinos represent almost 62% of all 
students, and blacks, make up almost 16%. Almost 15% of the students are 
Anglos, while almost 6% are Asians. 
</P>
<P>
The other finalist for the superintendent's job in 1987 was Deputy Supt. Sidney 
Thompson, a black and longtime district veteran. 
</P>
<P>
Britton arrived with a sound reputation for calm leadership and innovative 
ideas, including a proposal for school-based management, which gives more 
autonomy to each campus. He soon encountered a teachers' strike in which union 
leaders sought to portray him as the villain, and his low-key style alienated 
some. Unable to bring any of his key staff from Miami, Britton said he found it 
difficult to build a new team. He also found a sharply divided Board of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday Britton warmly congratulated Anton, and said he was proud of what had 
been accomplished under his own leadership.

GOLAND GETS JAIL TERM FOR ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN GIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael R. Goland, a Los Angeles businessman and fervent pro-Israel political 
contributor in a series of U.S. Senate campaigns, was sentenced to three months 
in "a jail-like facility" Monday for making an illegal contribution designed to 
help reelect Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Ronald S. W. Lew, in giving Goland one of the few prison 
sentences issued for a misdemeanor violation of making an unlawful donation, 
said he meant to make Goland an example to deter others from such offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ordered Goland to perform 1,000 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Lew ordered Goland to report for incarceration Aug. 31, although he said he 
would consider a motion from the defendant's attorney, Seth Waxman, to delay 
the sentence while the case is appealed. Lew's reference to a "jail-like 
facility" could open the way for a term in a federal conservation camp or other 
halfway-type institution. 
</P>
<P>
The contribution that led to Goland's prosecution was an indirect one. Court 
testimony showed he gave $120,000 to a third-party American Independent 
candidate, Edward B. Vallen, in an attempt to siphon votes away from Republican 
Ed Zschau, Cranston's main opponent, and thus reelect Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
Federal election laws prohibit an individual from giving more than $1,000 to a 
candidate in a general election campaign, unless it is spent independently. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has long been a supporter of Israel, while Goland suspected that 
Zschau was anti-Israel. In the tightly contested election, Vallen, aided by 
advertisements he bought with the Goland contribution, got 109,516 votes, about 
5,000 more than the margin by which Cranston defeated Zschau. 
</P>
<P>
There was no evidence that Cranston was involved in Goland's effort. In earlier 
campaigns, Goland gave more than $1 million to defeat Sen. Charles H. Percy 
(R-Ill.), a critic of Israeli policies, and hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
elect Sen. Chic Hecht (R-Nev.) and others he considered pro-Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Describing a last-minute pre-sentencing letter from Goland, Lew said he could 
see many parallels between his own life and Goland's, both sons of immigrants 
and both devoted to causes they deeply believed in. 
</P>
<P>
Lew said that unlike himself, Goland had "lost his direction" when he decided 
to violate campaign laws and that the issue was important to the integrity of 
the American political system. 
</P>
<P>
Goland and his attorney refused to release a copy of the letter and no copy was 
given to prosecutors. Lew's clerk, Helena Fagan, said the letter was "a 
personal communication" to the judge from the defendant that would not be made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Remarks about the letter by Goland's attorney and the judge indicated that 
Goland had acknowledged violating election laws and expressed some contrition. 
</P>
<P>
The federal jury that convicted Goland on May 3 on the election violation 
charge, after an earlier hung jury, also acquitted him on four counts of 
conspiracy and making false statements. It deadlocked on a felony false 
statement count. 
</P>
<P>
Lew said that while he believed Goland was "generally a good person," he was 
convinced Goland had either lied or colored the truth several times during his 
testimony.

Former state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya quietly entered a federal prison camp near 
the sweltering Mojave Desert town of Boron on Monday, one day before he was 
scheduled to begin serving a 6 1/2-year sentence for extortion, racketeering 
and money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Trading in his civilian clothes for a standard short-sleeved khaki prison 
uniform, Montoya, 51, became the first California legislator in 35 years to 
enter prison for crimes committed while in office. Ending with his resignation 
in February, the Whittier Democrat had served 11 years in the state Senate and 
six years in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya did not indicate to officials at the former U.S. Air Force radar 
station why he reported one day ahead of his mandatory reporting date, 
Associate Warden Andra Bettencourt said. 
</P>
<P>
"His sentence starts the day he comes in," she said. "He may just want to get 
his business taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya was assigned a work detail at the minimum-security facility, which 
houses 485 prisoners. Initially, all inmates are assigned to ground maintenance 
-- sweeping sidewalks and keeping the camp compound clean in temperatures that 
can soar as high as 122 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next several days, Montoya will undergo a physical examination, 
aptitude testing and orientation sessions. Eventually, he will be assigned to a 
permanent job, which could include maintenance work at Edwards Air Force Base 
or another military facility near the camp, which is in western San Bernardino 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya had asked the federal District Court that he be assigned to the federal 
prison camp at Lompoc, north of Santa Barbara, a facility once regarded as "the 
country club" of the U.S. correctional system. A number of celebrity felons 
have served their time at Lompoc, including several political figures who were 
caught up in the Watergate scandal of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Lompoc camp has been upgraded from a minimum- to medium-security 
facility and was considered inappropriate for a prisoner like Montoya, who has 
no prior convictions and is not considered an escape risk. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya's incarceration near Boron was based on several factors, including his 
lack of history of violence and the relatively small amount of money involved 
in his crimes, said Kris Southards, a community corrections specialist with the 
Federal Prison System in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The Boron facility is one of only two minimum-security federal prisons on the 
West Coast; the other is in Sheridan, Ore. The California camp has no fence 
around its perimeter, and prisoners are free to move around the grounds once 
their work details are completed, usually at about 3:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the prisoners at Boron have been convicted of drug-related 
offenses, according to Bettencourt. About 20% were convicted of fraud, 7% of 
larceny or theft, and 3% of income tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the buildings at the Boron camp are air-conditioned. But even on the 
hottest days, prisoners may be required to work outdoors. Bettencourt noted 
that the camp's recreational facilities -- including a fitness center with 
weight-training equipment -- are covered but located outside. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting privileges at the remote Boron camp are relatively generous -- up to 
three evenings a week, and all day on weekends. Montoya has been assigned to a 
room for up to four prisoners, who sleep on double bunks. 
</P>
<P>
In February, a federal jury in Sacramento found Montoya guilty on seven counts 
of using his office for personal gain after the lawmaker had been caught in an 
elaborate federal sting operation that focused on political corruption in the 
state capital. Crucial to the prosecution's case was a videotape showing the 
then-senator accepting a $3,000 payment from an undercover agent at a breakfast 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya has appealed his conviction, but earlier this month he lost an attempt 
to delay his sentence until the appeal was decided.

WELLS WORKS WELL FOR FIRST PAYCHECK, BEATING CARDINALS

<TEXT>
<P>
Terry Wells stood outside the Dodgers' dugout at Busch Stadium late Monday with 
a pen and a baseball card and tried to sign his autograph. And tried. And 
tried. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to excuse me," he shouted to the fan in the box seats after a 
five-second name took nearly a minute. "I'm a little shaky right now." 
</P>
<P>
Considering Wells had just cooly led the Dodgers to a 5-2 victory over the St. 
Louis Cardinals, nobody blamed him. On the night he received his first major 
league paycheck, the 26-year-old career minor leaguer also picked up his first 
major league victory. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will sign the game ball and give it to his wife. He also will sign 
the paycheck and give it to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"You know wives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have yet another reason to celebrate Monday's victory, their fourth 
in five games since the All-Star break. By holding the Cardinals to four hits 
in 6 1/3 innings, the hard-throwing Wells became the first Orel 
Hershiser-replacement starter to win since Hershiser underwent shoulder surgery 
April 27. 
</P>
<P>
In nine starts before Monday, four No. 5 pitchers had gone 0-6 with a 7.91 
earned-run average. The Dodgers had won one of those nine games. Those pitchers 
included Wells, Tim Crews and current Albuquerque Dukes John Wetteland and Mike 
Maddux. 
</P>
<P>
Many Dodgers think those nine starts may have been the biggest factor in the 
team's losing season. As Monday's victory pulls them to within one game of 
.500, they truly hope Wells has arrived . . . and that it's not too late. 
</P>
<P>
"It is tough to say anybody could fill Orel's shoes," catcher Mike Scioscia 
said. "But we have obviously expected more production out of our fifth starter. 
. . . Today has to be a great confidence booster for Terry." 
</P>
<P>
In making his third start since being recalled from Albuquerque July 2, Wells 
escaped one jam and then watched Jay Howell escape another to record his third 
consecutive save, seventh overall. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, a left-hander, was helped by a four-run sixth inning against Cardinal 
starter and loser Bob Tewksbury. It featured a two-run double by Scioscia, an 
RBI double by Hubie Brooks and another run that scored when a fly ball dropped 
between outfielders Wille McGee and Craig Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, who were booed repeatedly by the crowd of 25,405, lost for the 
fourth time in five games and remained in last place in the National League 
East. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, who spent five years in the Astro minor league system before the trade, 
mainly because of 368 walks in 532 2/3 innings, had walked only three in 10 
innings in two previous starts for the Dodgers. That earned him a third start. 
</P>
<P>
He retired the first 10 Cardinals, then made a major league escape after 
causing a fourth-inning jam. 
</P>
<P>
Wells gave up a one-out single to Ozzie Smith, the first Cardinal hit of the 
game. One out later, Pedro Guerrero singled up the middle. Todd Zeile doubled 
in a run, and out ran pitching coach Ron Perranoski. 
</P>
<P>
Wells promptly threw five consecutive balls, walking Terry Pendleton to load 
the bases and then falling behind 1-and-0 to Jose Oquendo. 
</P>
<P>
Then Wells found his legs. Oquendo took a strike and missed another, throwing 
his bat. Then a ball and two consecutive fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Wells threw a fastball that Oquendo popped up behind home plate and into the 
glove of Scioscia for the third out. "I felt like, 'OK, it's just me and you,' 
" Wells said of his duel with Oquendo."I decided to go right at him." 
</P>
<P>
Wells said he threw only one curve to Oquendo and only because he had forgotten 
the count. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw it on 1-and-2, but that was because I thought it was 2-and-2," he 
said. "I lost a ball in there somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
The next inning he was certain of the count, retiring three Cardinals on three 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
He was removed from the game in the seventh with one out after walking Wilson. 
Jim Gott worked out of that jam, then allowed two infield singles to start the 
eighth inning. Enter Howell, who allowed an RBI single by Guerrero and walked 
Zeile to load the bases with none out. 
</P>
<P>
Wells was on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"To have him do such a nice job and really show he can pitch, and then to let 
it away from him . . . I didn't want to do that," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
So, he had perhaps his finest three-batter stretch of the season, striking out 
Pendleton, retiring Oquendo on a foul out and striking out Wilson, who watched 
a curveball that, at the last instant, dropped nearly a foot. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was going to break at all," Howell said. "Then I saw 
Scioscia catching it low in the strike zone and I thought, 'Yeah, I guess it 
did break.' " 
</P>
<P>
Wells was watching the action on the clubhouse television set and trying to 
make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether to be more excited by the win or the paycheck," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sources have confirmed Dodger scouts were at Sunday's 3-2 victory by Detroit 
pitcher Steve Searcy over visiting Texas. Searcy, whom the Dodgers are hoping 
to acquire for Kirk Gibson, pitched a shutout for 5 2/3 innings before allowing 
two runs in his first major league victory this season. Detroit scouts 
following the Dodgers have also been pleased, recently reporting to the Tigers 
that Gibson appears healthy. . . . Even though it was one of his few nights off 
on the road during the season, Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda spent Sunday night in 
Busch Stadium here sitting behind home plate for the game between the Cardinals 
and San Francisco Giants. He was approached by so many autograph seekers, 
Cardinal officials offered to move him to a private box upstairs, but he 
refused. "What's wrong with signing autographs?" Lasorda said. "I'm the one 
who's honored by it." . . .Former Cardinal Julian Javier visited the Dodger 
clubhouse Monday and was welcomed as a member of the family. He is the father 
of Dodger outfielder Stan Javier. . . . Perhaps the hardest hit in the Dodgers' 
5-1 loss to Chicago Sunday occured when losing pitcher Tim Belcher smashed a 
bat against the dugout wall after one of his poor innings.

LANGSTON HEARS SAME FLAT NOTES BY ANGELS, 3-1; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: BREWERS HAND HIM HIS EIGHTH LOSS IN 12 STARTS SINCE MAY 15. THE 
ANGELS HAVE SCORED 15 RUNS IN THE 11 GAMES HE HAS LOST THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With one minor variation, Mark Langston struck the same losing chord Monday as 
he has so often this season. 
</P>
<P>
His 3-1 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers at Anaheim Stadium represented a change 
from the 2-1 defeats he seemed destined to absorb, but the end result was of 
prime importance -- and the loss was the same result he experienced in his 
previous five decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Deer broke a 1-1 tie in the seventh inning with a home run to left, and the 
Brewers added another run on a pair of singles around a walk as Langston (4-11) 
took his eighth loss in 12 starts since May 15. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at it, anytime you lose there's an error in your work," 
Langston said. "The home run to Deer, that's the situation I mean. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say it's not difficult, because it is. I can't say how much I want to 
turn it around, but I can't dwell on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't laying (the pitch to Deer) in, but I obviously was trying to throw a 
strike. He was swinging in that situation. You expect it." 
</P>
<P>
In the span since May 15, Langston has three no-decisions and one victory, June 
5 at Kansas City. In his last six starts, he is 0-5 with one no-decision and a 
4.14 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
At home, the 29-year-old left-hander is 1-6 in nine starts, having won only on 
April 11 when he combined with Mike Witt to pitch a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have scored 15 runs in the 11 games he has lost and had scored only 
nine runs at the time of his departure. They got 11 hits Monday, and one Angel 
was thrown out at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended the Angels' three-game winning streak and spoiled a memorable 
night for rookie first baseman Lee Stevens, who got his first major league hit 
in his first at-bat and drove in the Angels' only run in the fourth inning off 
Ron Robinson (3-1). 
</P>
<P>
Stevens was recalled from triple-A Edmonton late Sunday to take the place of 
Wally Joyner, who went on the 15-day disabled list because of a possible stress 
fracture in his right kneecap. 
</P>
<P>
Using Joyner's glove because some of his baggage had been lost, the 23-year-old 
power hitter had two singles and a double in his first three at-bats and 
commanded enough respect for the Brewers to summon ace reliever Dan Plesac to 
face him with two out and two on in the eighth. Stevens struck out, sending 
fans scurrying toward the exits. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who was batting .293 with 16 home runs and 66 RBIs in 90 games with 
the Trappers, led off the second by lining a single to right off Robinson in 
his first major league at-bat. Recognizing the importance of the feat, the 
crowd of 24,643 rewarded him with a round of applause. The ball was thrown in 
from the outfield for Stevens to save as a memento. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens' glory was short-lived. He was thrown out stealing second, but trotted 
back to the dugout to the accompaniment of scattered cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel I'd be this successful. I felt it would be a learning experience 
from Day 1," said Stevens, who singled in each of his first two at-bats and 
doubled in the sixth before striking out against Plesac with the tying run on 
second in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I can make something out of this chance they're giving me. I made 
something out of my minor league experience and I will make something out of my 
major league experience." 
</P>
<P>
He also made a quick lunge to snare a liner by Dave Parker in the eighth that 
Milwaukee Manager Tom Trebelhorn called, "as impressive to me as anything," but 
was less successful in trying to score from second in the sixth after he had 
doubled and Hill singled. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really happy and excited (about the promotion). I didn't get a whole lot 
of sleep (Sunday) because we were out celebrating our anniversary last night," 
said Stevens, who brought his wife, Kim, to the game. "It's been a nice week 
for me. A nice present. . . . Hopefully, we'll get a win tomorrow instead of a 
loss." 
</P>
<P>
Not even Stevens' heroics could save Langston. 
</P>
<P>
Through four innings, Langston had yielded one hit, on a ground ball that might 
have been scored an error. Shortstop Dick Schofield cut in front of second 
baseman Donnie Hill to play Bill Spiers' bouncer and fumbled the ball while 
taking it out of his glove and throwing. But Langston wasn't ruffled, and he 
ended the inning by getting Jim Gantner to tap the ball back to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens made himself the new fan favorite in the fourth inning, when he drove 
in the Angels' first run, then took second baseman Gantner out at second base 
to avert a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield led off the fourth by beating out a bouncer to deep short. Lance 
Parrish broke his bat, poking the ball through the hole between first and 
second, moving Winfield to third. Stevens didn't wait to see any more of 
Robinson's repertoire and grounded the first pitch into right field, scoring 
Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
When Hill grounded to short, Stevens barged into Gantner and bothered him 
enough to make him throw too late to get Hill at first. Bichette ended the 
inning by grounding into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers pulled even at 1-1 in the sixth. Gantner began things with a sharp 
grounder that deflected off Hill's glove for a hit. He moved to second when 
Robin Yount grounded a single through the left side and scored on Sheffield's 
single to center on a two-strike off-speed pitch. Langston was able to bear 
down and strike out Parker and do the same to Greg Vaughn on a 3-and-2 pitch. 
Those were Langston's fourth and fifth strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens further endeared himself to the crowd by lining a double to left-center 
field past the outstretched glove of Yount with two out in the sixth. But on 
Hill's single to left, home plate umpire Mark Johnson signaled that Stevens was 
out on a fine throw by Vaughn and a good block of the plate by catcher B.J. 
Surhoff. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
With Wally Joyner on the 15-day disabled list because of a possible stress 
fracture in his right kneecap and Lee Stevens at first base, the Angels used 
their 89th lineup in 90 games. Should tests Monday on Chili Davis' lower back 
show a problem, Manager Doug Rader's lineup juggling could intensify. Davis 
wasn't available Monday, but word on his condition is expected today. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at the Toronto ballclub and the talent they have and they don't have 
a set lineup," Rader said. "If you use a set lineup, people accuse you of being 
set in your ways and not imaginative. If you use a lineup you think is best on 
a given day, people say you're tinkering too much."

THE RUSH TO GERMAN UNITY PROVES UNSTOPPABLE 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's agreement Monday to accept a reunified Germany 
in the Western alliance is the latest and most dramatic example of the power of 
the idea of German unity. 
</P>
<P>
Since Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn first opened the Iron Curtain last 
September and East Germans began pouring West, it is an idea that has pushed 
aside all in its way. 
</P>
<P>
When West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl insisted one morning last 
February that a German currency union would take years, it required less than 
24 hours for him to bow to the political realities -- and only a few short 
months to implement that very currency union. 
</P>
<P>
Worries about the power of a united Germany, most visible in the West among the 
French class politique and followers of British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, were swept aside in the rush to endorse the idea at a European 
Community summit last April. 
</P>
<P>
In Germany itself, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's talk last November of a loose 
German confederation leading to eventual unification had by March become a call 
for all-German elections by the end of 1991. And these, by the end of last 
month, had been advanced to Dec. 2, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
When the Parliament elected then holds its first session, Germany will 
effectively be one. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Gorbachev became the latest to jump aside rather than be run over in 
the headlong rush, giving Moscow's blessing to what a year ago would have been 
inconceivable: a united Germany as a full, integrated member of the Atlantic 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
For some, it was as if an electric charge had cut the stuffy summer air in this 
Caucasus spa town as Kohl sat next to his host and calmly went down the list of 
Soviet concessions: NATO membership for a united Germany; withdrawal of Soviet 
forces in a relatively short period from what is now East Germany, while Allied 
troops stay in Berlin; a quick wrap-up of the rights of the World War II 
victorious powers in Germany, including those of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the euphoria on the official Luftwaffe Boeing 707 winging its way 
homeward to Bonn, Monday's agreement was far from a one-sided affair. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev won a commitment from Kohl to limit the size of a future German 
military to 370,000 personnel, roughly one-tenth the Soviet Union's troop 
strength, and renounce nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"This can't be of disadvantage to the Soviet Union," Gorbachev noted. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to argue that if anything, the accord on balance actually 
enhances Soviet security in the long term. Some analysts say the withdrawal of 
Soviet forces from East Germany will make little difference to Soviet security. 
Certainly, growing tension between newly democratic East Germans and Soviet 
forces stationed there makes Moscow's continued military presence in the region 
a questionable asset. 
</P>
<P>
If the terms agreed to by the two leaders become reality -- and initial praise 
from President Bush and some other Western leaders indicate there will be 
little opposition -- they will help outline the shape of a future European 
security order. 
</P>
<P>
While it will be an order in which Moscow's biggest single military contingent 
at present outside of its borders will eventualy disappear back into the Soviet 
Union, it is also an order in which a future united Germany is committed to a 
modest army. 
</P>
<P>
It has the earmarks of a formula that reassures Moscow yet allows the two 
Germanys to continue their race toward elections. 
</P>
<P>
After the news conference announcing the agreement, reporters filing out onto a 
patio spotted West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and his 
Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, sitting together on a two-seater 
garden swing sipping mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
Both were smiling.

<P>
Two prominent Solidarity activists who oppose union chief Lech Walesa formed a 
new political movement Monday that sympathizes with the government and 
advocates a popular vote for president. 
</P>
<P>
The movement, called Democratic Action, said it would try to present a "strong 
alternative," to the two-month-old Center Alliance that wants Walesa named 
president by Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The movement's formation comes after Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and 
Walesa declared a political truce in their feud over the pace of political and 
economic changes. 
</P>
<P>
About 90 people attended the founding meeting, including many of the 63 
advisers and Solidarity activists who broke ranks with Walesa at a stormy June 
24 meeting of the national Citizens Committee, which Walesa controls. 
</P>
<P>
The group's leaders include Zbigniew Bujak, former Warsaw regional leader of 
Solidarity and head of the Solidarity underground during the martial-law period 
in the early 1980s, and Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, Solidarity leader in Lower 
Silesia. 
</P>
<P>
The new movement scheduled a founding congress for July 28, and representatives 
said they intend to meet with Solidarity members of both houses of Parliament 
on Friday to invite them to join the movement. 
</P>
<P>
Bujak and Frasyniuk were once regarded as Walesa's potential heirs within 
Solidarity. But in recent months they have distanced themselves from him, 
complaining about his autocratic style.

GERMAN-BASHING ISSUE HAUNTS THATCHER; 
</P>
<P>
BRITAIN: A HUNT BEGINS FOR THE PERSON WHO LEAKED A GOVERNMENT MEMO LISTING 
'BULLYING' AND 'EGOTISM' AMONG GERMAN CHARACTER TRAITS.

<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Monday launched a political damage-control 
campaign aimed at safeguarding her country's image in Europe after a leaked, 
internal document describing key German character traits as "bullying," 
"egotism," "angst" and "aggressiveness" added to the controversy surrounding 
Britain's official attitude toward European unity. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the prime minister announced that a formal investigation will 
be held into the weekend leak of the confidential memorandum. The memo was 
prepared by Thatcher's private secretary as a report on discussions about 
Germany and its role in Europe during a private think-tank session the prime 
minister attended with senior British policy-makers last March. 
</P>
<P>
The formal inquiry will target senior British Defense Ministry and Foreign 
Ministry officials familiar with the session. The probe was announced by the 
prime minister's office at 10 Downing St. after a weekend of continuing media 
criticism and deepening political debate about Britain's policies toward its 
European neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The leaked document was published in the Independent newspaper Sunday, one day 
after Thatcher attempted to end a similar controversy by accepting the 
resignation of Minister of Trade and Industry Nicholas Ridley. 
</P>
<P>
Ridley had made critical remarks about the Germans, the French and the European 
Community in general in an interview with the prestigious magazine the 
Spectator, and the remarks generated a storm of controversy when they were 
published last week. 
</P>
<P>
Ridley, 61, a British aristocrat famous for his occasionally undiplomatic 
candor, did, however, echo the sentiments of many World War II-era Britons in 
voicing his strong skepticism about Germany's continuing role in unifying 
Europe, calling it "a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe." 
Ridley also said the French were behaving like "poodles" in permitting Germany 
to dominate the unification movement, and he condemned the 17-member European 
Commission as "unelected reject politicians," adding, "You might just as well 
give it (sovereignty) to Adolf Hitler." 
</P>
<P>
The commission is the executive body of the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, Thatcher's government supports European unity, although she has 
been the most cautious of all European leaders in selecting the time frame for 
bringing down the borders between the EC's 12 member nations. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's opponents in Britain's Labor Party tried hard late last week to cast 
Ridley's stated opinions as the privately held beliefs of the prime minister as 
well, a charge she denied in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday's leak made it even more difficult for Thatcher to distance herself 
from the anti-Europeanist elements in her Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
The leaked memorandum concluded that present-day Germany is not a threat to 
Britain and generally endorsed the idea of a unified Europe. But it was 
revealing of the overall cynicism with which some senior officials still view 
the German nation. 
</P>
<P>
The report quoted no one by name; rather, it described the general discussions 
and conclusions of those who attended, chief among them Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
"We started by talking about the Germans themselves and their characteristics," 
the prime minister's secretary wrote toward the beginning of his report on the 
session, which was held at Chequers, Thatcher's weekend retreat. "It was easier 
-- and more pertinent to the present discussion -- to think of the less happy 
ones: their insensitivity to the feelings of others, their obsession with 
themselves, a strong inclination to self-pity and a longing to be liked. 
</P>
<P>
"Some even less-flattering attributes were also mentioned as an abiding part of 
the German character: in alphabetical order, angst, aggressiveness, 
assertiveness, bullying, egotism, inferiority complex, sentimentality." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the document added, "There was a strong school of thought among 
those present that today's Germans were very different from their 
predecessors." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after a long discussion of the social and political changes that have 
taken place within Germany during the four decades since Hitler's war machine 
bombed Britain and conquered most of Europe, the memorandum concluded: 
</P>
<P>
"The overall message was unmistakeable: We should be nice to the Germans. But 
even the optimists had some unease, not for the present and the immediate 
future but for what might lie further down the road than we can yet see." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the second round of bitter debate touched off by the leaked memo, 
diplomatic repair efforts were under way Monday on a regional scale as well. 
And most met with apparent success. 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's EC foreign ministers meeting in Brussels, Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd was quoted as saying that he had encountered no problems with his 
counterparts as a result of the controversy, an assessment shared publicly, at 
least, by perhaps the most important of his European colleagues on British 
television Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Irmgard Adam-Schwatzer, the German official standing in for West German Foreign 
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, declared simply, "It is a British internal 
political affair."

<TEXT>
<P>
Willie Jean Nash is a 30-year-old welfare mother of five children who, like 
many of her friends, has never been married. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm waiting for the right man," she said recently at a preschool center in a 
dismal public housing project on the South Side of Chicago. "I'm waiting for 
someone who has a good job and is good to the kids. But they are hard to find." 
</P>
<P>
Nash's comments cut to the heart of one of the most dismaying problems of the 
black underclass in the large cities of America -- an enormous and ever-growing 
number of families headed by single, unmarried mothers on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
The number of black families headed by a single mother more than doubled from 
1.3 million in 1970 to 3 million in 1987. The percentage of black families 
headed by mothers who had never married increased from 16% to 37%. In Illinois, 
where Nash lives, four in every five children born to black mothers in their 
early 20s are illegitimate; so are practically all children born to black 
teen-age mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Although some analysts blame the welfare system or some kind of cultural 
failing among poor blacks, many sociologists believe that the cause of the 
disturbing phenomenon is more obvious: the shortage of marriageable males in 
the black underclass. 
</P>
<P>
Few young men have good enough jobs to support a family; most are either out of 
work or in jail or at school. In sheer economic terms, analysts say, a typical 
young, underclass black male is usually worthless to a family. He cannot earn 
enough to support the family. If he marries the mother of his children anyway, 
analysts note, she will lose much of her welfare assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"Black women, especially young black women, are facing a shrinking pool of 
'marriageable' (i.e., economically stable) men," according to sociologist 
William Julius Wilson of the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Testa, a colleague of Wilson at the University of Chicago, said that 
illegitimacy was a stigma as recently as 25 or 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Women wanted to give their children a name," Testa said in his office, less 
than a mile from Willie Jean Nash's housing project. "So you would have seen 
higher rates of marriage to jobless men just for social reasons. That has 
changed now. Very few women will say that they think it's a good idea to marry 
a jobless man." 
</P>
<P>
The large number of young, single mothers perpetuates a cycle of poverty. 
Mothers drop out of high school before they have enough training to qualify for 
anything but the most menial and poor-paying jobs. They often lack the maturity 
and the income to guide their children out of the traps of the inner city. The 
children grow up to become unemployed fathers and single mothers. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey of young black men in the inner city, Testa found that half 
said they had become fathers before their 25th birthday. That is no different 
from similar surveys taken for many years. 
</P>
<P>
"What has changed dramatically," said Testa, "is the proportion who are not 
working and the proportion of those jobless men who fail to marry the mother of 
their first child. . . . Employed men were almost twice as likely to marry the 
mother of their first child conceived out of wedlock as were unemployed men." 
</P>
<P>
The image of the unmarried mother has convinced many Americans that the inner 
cities are crammed with poor young women breeding children like never before. 
The evidence does not bear the image out. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, younger black women are having fewer children than they once did. The 
fertility rates of black women between the ages of 15 and 24 have plummeted 
since 1960, as it has for young white women. The average family on welfare had 
three children in 1970; by 1985, the average had dropped to two. Willie Jean 
Nash, with her five children, is the exception, not the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Testa said that many poor black women tend to have two or perhaps three 
children before their mid-20s but then stop. Their birth rate is thus not much 
different from that of middle-class women who postpone children until they have 
assured themselves of a stable marriage and perhaps a career. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, black women of all ages are having about the same number of children 
as they did 20 years ago. The total number of black births increased from 
565,000 in 1970 to only 622,000 in 1986. During the same period, the percentage 
of children born out of wedlock almost doubled from 38% to 61%. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to keep those two facts straight," Testa said. The big change is the 
dearth of marriages -- not the numbers of children born to young mothers. 
Marriage among very young blacks is a disappearing institution." 
</P>
<P>
Climentene Jones, who works at the center attended by Nash's children, said 
that she asks pregnant teen-agers why they would allow themselves to become 
pregnant when the reward is usually a certain sentence to extreme poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"They look at you . . ," she said. "Sometimes people feel like this is their 
opportunity to love something, or it makes them feel more adult. Whatever." 
</P>
<P>
"The teen pregnancy thing," said Sister Susanne Beaton, a Roman Catholic nun 
who works with homeless mothers in Boston, "is nothing but a reflection of the 
search for love. The mothers have something that pays attention to them and 
that they have as their own." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said that a large number of pregnant teen-agers know very little about 
birth control. And, although Willie Jean Nash acknowledged having one abortion, 
most social workers say that abortion is almost never discussed by young 
pregnant black mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor, does not finance 
abortions. In Chicago, Jones said, private abortions cost about $350, well 
beyond the reach of poor pregnant black teen-agers on welfare.

NIXON HOME CAREFULLY RESTORED

When Richard Milhous Nixon steps into his birthplace during opening ceremonies 
for his presidential library, it will be as if he had never left home. 
</P>
<P>
There, in its original position against a living room wall, will be the piano 
Nixon practiced on as a boy. In the kitchen will be the same highchair in which 
he and his brothers once sat to eat. And in the bedroom of his parents, Frank 
and Hannah Nixon, will be the very bed upon which Nixon was born 77 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The wood-frame farmhouse built by Nixon's father in 1912 has been restored as a 
nearly identical replica of the home in which the former President spent the 
first nine years of his life before the family moved to Whittier. Even the same 
pepper and palm trees still shade the simple house. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the Nixon family and does reflect the family and what it possessed," 
said Ken Raymond, a partner in the San Francisco firm that restored the former 
President's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
Dwarfed by the sleek new presidential library next door, the little white house 
is nevertheless considered a prominent feature of the $21-million Richard M. 
Nixon Library and Birthplace. According to officials of the Nixon library 
foundation, the library would not be in Yorba Linda were it not for the 
birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
"We sort of view it as the heartbeat of the library," said Raymond, of the 
historical restoration firm of Brown, Raymond, Boulton &amp; Szabo. "It is 
where he was born. The house is a singular expression of the President's 
roots." 
</P>
<P>
The house shows the humble beginnings from which Nixon ascended to the 
presidency. The family lived in poverty under the crushing weight of medical 
expenses for two of Nixon's seriously ill brothers, said Stephen Ambrose, a 
University of New Orleans historian who has authored two Nixon biographies. One 
of Nixon's five brothers died in childhood, Ambrose added. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our last log cabin President," Ambrose said. 
</P>
<P>
Spartan by today's standards, the 900-square-foot house does not contain a 
bathtub and is so compact that almost the entire ground floor can be viewed 
from the living room. Upstairs is the cramped attic loft where Nixon slept with 
his brothers. 
</P>
<P>
As basic as the house is, restoring the home to its original condition was no 
easy feat. The project, which took more than 20 years to complete and cost 
about $450,000, involved everyone from restoration experts to a network of 
Nixon family members who gathered heirlooms to re-create the rooms the Nixon 
boys played in. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to salvage the old house first began in 1968, when Nixon won the 
Republican presidential nomination and civic leaders in his hometown of Yorba 
Linda recognized the historical importance of the home. By that time, it had 
been occupied by a series of people, many of them custodians for the Richard 
Nixon Elementary School that formerly occupied the library site. 
</P>
<P>
Roland E. Bigonger, a Yorba Linda city councilman and local lawyer, joined five 
other civic leaders in forming the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Yorba Linda School District owned the home, Bigonger, now 68, and 
still a councilman, said the district allowed the birthplace foundation to 
maintain and repair it. The foundation put in a standing offer to buy the home 
if the district ever wanted to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
When Nixon was elected President in 1968, Bigonger said the foundation erected 
a flagpole next to the house and installed a plaque noting the site as a 
presidential birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, Nixon's sister-in-law, Clara Jane Nixon, set about 
gathering furniture, books and other belongings that Frank and Hannah Nixon had 
used to adorn their Yorba Linda home. Clara Jane Nixon, 70, widow of Nixon's 
brother, Donald, said the vast majority of the items fell into her hands after 
Hannah Nixon's death in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard had just a few things he wanted," said Clara Nixon of Irvine. "The 
rest of it we didn't know what to do with." 
</P>
<P>
With her brother-in-law about to become the nation's 37th President, Clara 
Nixon said she decided to store most of the belongings in the garage of the 
home she and her husband had in Newport Beach, anticipating that some day the 
items would be historically valuable. 
</P>
<P>
She also put out the call to other family members for heirlooms. It turned out 
that her daughter in Yorba Linda had the family's original dinner table. One of 
Hannah Nixon's sisters was using the family's china cabinet. The bed on which 
Nixon was born -- and an 1875 quilt used to cover it -- were found hanging in 
Nixon's grandparents' barn in east Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
After three years of safeguarding the family keepsakes, Clara Nixon decided to 
turn them over to the Nixon Birthplace Foundation, which put the items into 
storage in a Santa Ana warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
After Nixon's resignation in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal, Bigonger said the 
birthplace foundation entered what he calls its dark period. For the next three 
years, he said, foundation members gathered as usual in Bigonger's Yorba Linda 
law office, but the meetings were perfunctory and accomplished little. 
</P>
<P>
"We just tried to hang on," Bigonger said. 
</P>
<P>
Events began picking up again in 1977 when the Yorba Linda School District 
agreed to sell the Nixon farmhouse and its 1.1-acre tract for $125,000. (The 
Nixon Elementary School was demolished about four years ago because of 
declining enrollment.) Until 1988, when the birthplace foundation merged with 
the library foundation, the house was occupied by maintenance workers who took 
care of it in lieu of paying rent, Bigonger said. 
</P>
<P>
While ground was being broken for the adjoining library in 1988, Raymond and 
his staff of designers and architects took a look inside the old farmhouse to 
assess what it would take to restore the place. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond said the group was in for a shock. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a complete disaster," said Raymond, who directed the interior 
restoration. "It had not been loved for many years." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem, he said, was that each occupant of the home had made 
modifications over the years that, when combined, completely altered the house. 
Walls had been torn down, doors and tiling had been added and a shower and tub 
had been installed where, in Nixon's youth, there had been only a wall-mounted 
sink. And the kitchen had been expanded to include the room where Nixon's 
mother did her canning. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, architects encountered another formidable challenge: virtually all of 
the wood siding was rotted and had to be replaced, said George Szabo, a San 
Diego architect and partner in Raymond's firm, which directed the outside 
restoration. Window frames and the shingle roof also needed replacing, Szabo 
said. And the concrete foundation that Frank Nixon had poured nearly 80 years 
earlier was so badly deteriorated that the house had to be lifted and a new 
foundation poured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The original structure of the house, however, remained intact. The chimney was 
solid. The original trim around the exterior and some floors, walls and plaster 
on the inside were also in good enough shape to remain in place, Szabo said. 
</P>
<P>
"The (original) craftsmanship was excellent," Szabo said. "It's impressive the 
way it came out. We just brought it back to what it was." 
</P>
<P>
In their restoration work, Raymond and Szabo relied heavily upon advice from 
the former President. In a three-hour meeting at Nixon's New Jersey home last 
October, Raymond said the former President was adamant on a number of points. 
</P>
<P>
"He would say, 'This item was here and this item was there,' " Raymond said. 
"He was very, very clear." 
</P>
<P>
Using Nixon's recollections as a guide, Raymond said he furnished the house as 
closely as he could to match the original. More than 90% of the furnishings 
were in the house at the time the Nixons occupied it, Raymond said. Other 
items, including the stove and beds in the boys' room, were not the family's 
but are representative of the same period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the restoration was completed in June, Clara Jane Nixon accompanied 
reporters on a tour of the Nixon farmhouse. Standing in the living room that 
she had heard so much about from her late husband, she nodded her head in 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We always dreamed of opening the little home to the public," Clara Nixon said. 
"Now you're going to see this happen."

FOR SOME EARLY RIDERS, THE PAST IS PROLOGUE

<TEXT>
<P>
It was well before dawn. The streets of downtown Long Beach were mostly 
deserted, but Jed Hughes was already in line -- half an hour early -- to meet 
the train. The line was short, just three people. They stood on a raised, 
rather desolate boarding platform in the center median of Long Beach Boulevard, 
just waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes was excited. He had been planning for months to be on the first Monday 
morning Blue Line train from Long Beach to Los Angeles, a train that would 
usher in a new era in commuting. He already had walked a mile, leaving his 
condominium at 4:30 a.m., to be sure of making the 5:30 departure time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm riding, really, for historic purposes," the 52-year-old workers' 
compensation specialist said. "I was on the last Red Car (train) coming into 
Long Beach in 1961. I'm very pleased to see it come back." 
</P>
<P>
In the 29 years since he rode that final, crowded Pacific Red Car line one late 
April night, Hughes has been through college, a failed marriage and has raised 
three children to adulthood. Now, thinner of hair and thicker in the middle, he 
stepped aboard a quieter, smoother train -- a Japanese-built train -- and 
turned back the clock. 
</P>
<P>
The 5:30 train departed without fanfare or difficulty. Scarcely two dozen 
passengers were aboard, several of them train buffs like Hughes, wanting to be 
a part of history. James Washington, a 40-year-old librarian, was one. He 
brought along his camera and asked another rider to photograph him in his 
window seat. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to be in on the experience," he said, recalling his own rides on the Red 
Car as a grade-schooler. For the trains to come back was "almost a lifetime 
wait," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the train rolled north across Anaheim Street toward Watts and 
South-Central Los Angeles, passengers became acquainted with the train horn -- 
as harsh and incessant as an angry goose. It blasted at every intersection. 
James Strong, a civil engineer with Southern Pacific Railroad, which helped to 
create the Blue Line, settled into a seat just behind the driver's control room 
and smiled with satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
He, too, had ridden the old Red Cars. This was much smoother. He did have one 
complaint: "I don't like the horn, though -- it's awful." 
</P>
<P>
Passengers trickled aboard at each station. After the sixth stop, at Compton, 
the first car was nearly full. Bob Davis, 50, of San Gabriel, took a seat 
facing the aisle, having driven half an hour just to take the junket, which is 
free through the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a rail fan," Davis declared. "It has a kind of Chicago feeling -- a lot of 
elevated sections. I was in Chicago last year. If this can work half as well as 
Chicago, it'll be doing great." 
</P>
<P>
Davis reminisced about his childhood in Monrovia when "the ancestors of these 
trains went practically through my bedroom." As he spoke, a flash appeared in 
the window. "Oh, my goodness! A freight train!" And he paused to watch it pass 
on its way south. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers traveled in silence, several of them reading newspapers 
-- a la subway commuters of New York -- or studying train schedules. Compton 
resident Bernard Strickland, 37, an auditor for the Internal Revenue Service, 
listened to the rhythms of a stereo headphone as he pored over a route map. His 
plan: Disembark at 103rd Street and catch a bus to West Los Angeles. If he 
drives, he said, he can get there in an hour and 15 minutes. But he would be 
happy to get there 15 minutes later if he could get away from freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"My first audit is at 8:15," Strickland said, tucking the map away. He was 
expecting to arrive in a good mood. "So far," the IRS man said, "it's working 
out well. I have great expectations." 
</P>
<P>
The landscape drew occasional criticism: Out the wide view windows lay 
seemingly nothing but graffiti-covered warehouses and liquor stores, 
trash-strewn yards and boarded-up shops. The station stops were quick -- about 
a minute each -- and the 55-minute trip downtown seemed to pass quickly, 
several passengers remarked. 
</P>
<P>
Trains became more crowded as the morning went on. Hurrying to make the 7:35 
train, 86-year-old Ethel Smith tripped and fell on the tracks in the middle of 
Long Beach Boulevard, cutting her hand and knee. She lay for a moment in the 
path of a stationary train before she was helped up by Blue Line officials and 
escorted aboard. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hurrying and I didn't step up when I should have," she explained. She 
was on her way to a child-development center where she works five days a week. 
She had walked more than seven blocks to reach the train, hoping it would shave 
more than an hour off her daily two-hour bus trip. 
</P>
<P>
Wheelchair passenger Wally Berryman was aboard a packed train at 10:30 a.m., 
heading downtown to shop. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't overlook anything," he said happily. "A person in a wheelchair can 
accept a job in Los Angeles now. Nothing can go any smoother than this."

SHERIFF'S RAIL PATROL READY -- AND WAITING; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITY: MINOR FLAREUPS ARE MET BY A SHOW OF FORCE ON THE BLUE LINE. BUT THE 
RELATIVE PEACE HAS BEEN A PLEASANT EARLY SURPRISE.

The first sound of trouble Monday came from the mobile radio perched on the 
shoulder of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Oxley. A fellow officer 
had stopped some gang members at the 103rd Street station and was calling for 
backup help -- fearing a potential disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
On board the southbound Blue Line, Oxley was still several stops away as the 
train glided along the tracks at 55 m.p.h. But by the time his train had 
arrived, the crisis was over. The gang members had dispersed and the emergency 
call had been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The 103rd Street platform, however, was still bustling with a dozen sheriff's 
deputies who, like Oxley, had suddenly materialized like some kind of transit 
cavalry. 
</P>
<P>
From trains, foot patrols and radio cars, they had responded swiftly to the 
emergency call. Now, they were waiting to re-board the trains and resume their 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's incident was typical of the first three days of Blue Line operations, 
a minor flareup met by a major show of force. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been that way all along," said Oxley, who has spent 40 hours over the 
last three days moving from station to station as part of the Blue Line 
security force. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with gangs hasn't happened," he said. "The crime problems haven't 
happened. It's all been pretty peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
The relative tranquillity has been a relief to transit and sheriff's officials 
who have acknowledged that Los Angeles County's successful return to a commuter 
rail system will rely heavily on whether people feel safe riding the trains. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-mile line traverses some of the most crime-ridden and gang-plagued 
territory in the county, but none of that was in evidence over the first few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like making football plans to attack your opponents and the opponents 
never show up," said Lt. Jim Holts of the Sheriff's Transit Services Bureau, 
formed especially for the job. "You've got the field to yourself." 
</P>
<P>
After three days and more than 100,000 passengers, Holts said there were only 
three arrests -- for trespassing, public drunkenness and disorderly conduct and 
battery when a passenger slapped another rider during an argument. 
</P>
<P>
For many passengers, the highly visible presence of deputies was a reassuring 
sight -- especially on the weekend when deputies from other stations, mounted 
patrolmen and undercover officers beefed up security to about 200 officers -- 
well above the normal complement of 120 sworn officers assigned to the transit 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to have to get the word out to the public that it is safe and 
they have to demonstrate that it's safe because a lot of people are concerned 
about that," said Mike Hinton, a certified public accountant who was commuting 
Monday from his home in Long Beach to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Other passengers voiced the same concern, noting that some criminals may be 
biding their time until the hoopla and security wane. Gazing at the army of 
deputies around her, one Compton woman scoffed. "Let's see if these guys are 
around like this six months from now when I'm riding the train at night," she 
said shaking her head. 
</P>
<P>
But Sheriff's Capt. Frank Vadurro, who heads the transit bureau, said he is 
confident that the department will keep up a high level of security long after 
the fanfare dies down. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to stay," he said. "We are going to maintain this as a crime-free 
line to the greatest extent possible. That's what we're about." 
</P>
<P>
When the month of free fares is over, sheriff's deputies will be involved in 
checking fares as well as ensuring that radios are silent and nobody is 
smoking, eating or drinking on the trains -- "quality of life" issues that 
sheriff's officials say will make up a major share of violations on transit 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the specter of violent crime and the shadowy presence of gangs that 
worries many passengers. And on the inaugural weekend, deputies kept a special 
eye out for gang members, even those merely out to enjoy a free train ride. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they're peaceful, they have a right to ride the trains," Deputy 
Oxley said. "As long as they don't break the law, it's OK. And we're here to 
make sure they don't break the law."

Romania's former secret police chief testified in Bucharest that Nicu

revolution that toppled his father, often opposed his parents' policies. Gen. 
Col. Iulian Vlad, who headed deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's Securitate

younger Ceausescu was the only member of the state leadership to openly oppose 
his parents' policies.

Arab states said they will boycott companies and other institutions that help 
Jews immigrate to Israel.

Foreign ministers from the 22-member Arab League, meeting in Tunisia, said in a 
statement that the influx of Jews poses "a very grave threat to national 
security, to the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and to peace 
efforts." More than 50,000 Soviet Jews have immigrated to Israel so far this 
year. At their two-day meeting, the diplomats also supported the Palestine 
Liberation Organization's rejection of U.S. demands for resuming a dialogue.

Parish, 53, was released after an appeal by Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda 
and flown to Lusaka, Zambia's capital. In March, she was sentenced by a 
revolutionary court for driving journalist Farzad Bazoft to the site of a 
secret military installation to check reports of an explosion. Bazoft, 31, was 
executed after allegedly confessing to spying for Israel and Britain.

U.S. OPPOSES MERGER OF CONCERT FACILITIES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department said it will file a civil antitrust suit this week 
opposing a proposed alliance between Orange County's two outdoor pop concert 
facilities, charging that a merger would reduce competition, not enhance it as 
parties to the deal have argued. Operators of the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa 
Mesa plan to join with a major food concessions firm in buying a controlling 
interest in the venue's longtime rival in the concert market, Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the proposed transaction would create a monopoly in concert 
venues in Orange County," said Assistant Atty. Gen. James F. Rill. "We found no 
circumstances that would justify this result, which we believe would adversely 
affect consumers." Officials at the Nederlander Organization, which owns and 
operates the Pacific, maintained that in gaining ownership interest in Irvine, 
they would provide equal access at both facilities to booking agents, which 
would increase, rather than decrease, competition.

ALATORRE SEEKS CLEARER LAPD RULE ON ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing public testimony about eroding trust in police by immigrants and 
refugees, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre said Monday that he 
planned to move forward to clarify a city policy instructing officers not to 
turn illegal aliens over to immigration authorities, unless they are charged 
with serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the longstanding policy has come into question recently, in 
particular after police turned 27 illegals they rescued from smugglers over to 
immigration authorities last month. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre and Councilman Michael Woo have drafted a proposal to amend the 1979 
policy to more specifically direct police not to take such action without 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Public Safety Committee he chairs, Alatorre said Monday 
that the police have shown a willingness to abide by the letter, but not the 
spirit, of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre said that over the years, "too many holes" have weakened the policy, 
allowing for broad "misinterpretation" by officers, and that the policy is no 
longer protecting the rights of immigrants as was intended. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us, whether citizens or not, have an interest in seeing trust (in 
police) restored," said Woo, noting that if aliens are afraid of being 
deported, they will not report crimes to police. 
</P>
<P>
George A. Morrison, the Los Angeles Police Department's chief of staff, told 
Alatorre that the department had not had sufficient time to study the proposed 
policy changes, but would bring an assessment to next Monday's committee 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison did say, however, that some of the changes would put the department in 
conflict with existing laws and did not take into account some "real-life 
situations" officers might face on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for immigrants and refugees testified that police have turned 
illegals over to immigration authorities for such petty crimes as selling 
Christmas cards, for playing a stereo too loud or, in the case of a homeless 
12-year-old Nicaraguan, for curfew violation. 
</P>
<P>
"In recent months, it's become increasingly apparent to us that refugees who 
fall into the hands of the Los Angeles police as witnesses or victims risk 
being handed over to the INS," said Madeline Janis, director of the Central 
American Refugee Center. 
</P>
<P>
Janis is the attorney who placed the call to police that, unexpectedly, led to 
the arrests of the 27 aliens who were being held hostage by smugglers. Janis 
added that more than half of the aliens were deported by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer in good conscience advise people to cooperate with police," 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
Others who work with refugees and immigrants said they found themselves in the 
same quandary. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Cacavas, director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against 
Women, cited the case of a Panamanian woman who said she was raped by a Los 
Angeles police officer, but did not report the crime, fearing she would be 
turned over to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
"She is not alone. Assailants know these women can be silenced," Cacavas said. 
</P>
<P>
Janis, who with other immigrants' advocates has met with police over the issue, 
said that in dozens of conversations with Los Angeles police officers, at all 
levels, she has detected a growing anti-immigrant sentiment. She said there is 
a sense that "the undocumented are culpable of something, (are) all criminals 
and should be deported." 
</P>
<P>
It only follows, Janis added, that the Police Department wants to maintain wide 
discretion to report illegals to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been stonewalled," the attorney said. "We've received an emphatic 'no' 
from the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
She said committee action was needed to move the issue forward. 
</P>
<P>
Illegals who are convicted of serious crimes are deported after serving their 
sentences. Under the proposed policy clarification, even when charges are 
dropped, an alien's illegal status would have been reported to INS, which would 
leave him at risk of deportation.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER CONVICTION IN ACID ATTACK IS UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The murder conviction of a man for throwing acid into the face of a Sylmar 
woman was upheld Monday by a federal appeals court, which said he was properly 
prevented from acting as his own lawyer because of a severe stutter. 
</P>
<P>
"Communicating with . . . a jury is the essence of a trial," said the 9th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals in a 3-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Although self-representation in a criminal case is a constitutional right, it 
can be denied to those who cannot follow court procedures, the court said. 
Defendant Bobby Ray Savage's "inability to communicate his thoughts orally" 
would have left him unable to question witnesses or argue to the jury, the 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
Savage, of Las Vegas, was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the fatal 
attack on Patricia Worrell, 34, at her home in August, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Richard Gilman, Worrell's former fiance, hired Savage and 
another man for $750 to attack Worrell after she broke off their engagement.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPANY FINED $15,000 IN SOIL DUMPING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An excavating company was fined $15,000 Monday for illegally dumping 
gasoline-contaminated soil at a Sun Valley landfill. 
</P>
<P>
L. Bain Co., based in Paramount, was also placed on three years' informal 
probation by Municipal Court Commissioner Robert Sandoval after company 
attorneys pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of knowingly disposing of 
hazardous waste at an unlicensed facility. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office said the company had been hired to dig up a leaking 
fuel tank at a Unocal service station in Pacoima in June, 1989, then illegally 
dumped gasoline-contaminated soil from the excavation site at the Bradley 
Landfill in Sun Valley. Unocal was fined $4,700 in May after pleading no 
contest to two misdemeanor hazardous waste counts in the case.

Thirteen bobcats and more than 50 other animals were seized from an Acton 
residence Monday where authorities said a woman had been operating an 
unlicensed wild animal compound and dog kennel for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County animal control officers confiscated the animals from Susan 
Jennifer Arn, 44, who kept them in cages on her rural property. 
</P>
<P>
Arn was arrested on suspicion of operating an unlicensed wild animal compound, 
a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail or a fine of up to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 bobcats and two chousts -- a cross breed of bobcat and domestic cat -- 
were taken to the Wildlife Waystation, a private animal preserve in Little 
Tujunga Canyon. The other animals, including 40 golden retrievers, 10 cats, 
five kittens and two five-foot-long boa constrictors, were being held at the 
county Animal Care and Control shelter in Castaic.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STATE WIDENS PROBE OF ELECTRICAL VAULT 
BLASTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State investigators probing last week's electrical vault explosion in Pasadena 
that killed three city workers said Monday that they are also looking into a 
similar blast in Los Angeles two years ago, and any other similar explosions, 
to determine if changes in safety procedures may be required. 
</P>
<P>
Isaac Chae, district manager at the Cal/OSHA office in Covina, said he has 
contacted other Cal/OSHA offices for reports of vault explosions and has 
requested that a senior safety engineer with electrical expertise be sent to 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"The procedure of how to enter into the vault is one aspect we have to look 
into," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how many such explosions have occurred or how many 
Cal/OSHA will include in its investigation.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DISABLED DEMONSTRATE AT DEUKMEJIAN'S HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 150 people, many of them disabled, picketed Gov. George Deukmejian's 
Long Beach home Monday morning to protest proposed state budget cuts in funding 
for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, some in wheelchairs, complained that Deukmejian wants to slash 
state support for 26 Independent Living Centers operating throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The centers offer support services for the disabled, helping them seek jobs and 
housing and teaching them to live on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't balance your budget on our lives," proclaimed one poster carried by a 
woman in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
The centers get $5 million a year, or about a third of their annual budget, 
from the state, according to Norma Jean Vescovo, executive director of the 
Independent Living Centers of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed cut is one of many being considered in Sacramento as the governor 
and legislators wrestle to close a yawning budget deficit.

BABY INJURED AS MOTHER JUMPS FROM OVERPASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 38-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder early Monday 
after jumping off a freeway overpass with her 9-month-old son in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
The infant, Charles Edward Lee Jr., suffered severe head injuries when he 
struck the pavement after falling 15 feet from the bridge above the Harbor 
Freeway, near 9th Street. 
</P>
<P>
He was in critical condition at County-USC Medical Center, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Broaden, who police said had recently arrived from Louisiana, was 
bruised slightly in the fall. She was being held in the medical center's jail 
ward, where she was booked on suspicion of attempted murder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
At about 11 p.m. Sunday, Broaden and the baby were picked up by a taxi at the 
Greyhound bus station downtown, said Detective Vivian Gomez of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's child abuse unit. When the cab reached the Harbor Freeway, 
the woman began to show signs of being distraught, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
While the taxi was moving, Broaden opened her door and tried to exit, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The woman said something about someone trying to rob her," Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
Police gave this account of what followed: 
</P>
<P>
The cab driver pulled to the curb and Broaden jumped out. After running a short 
distance, Broaden straddled the overpass railing, hugged the baby close, and 
jumped. 
</P>
<P>
Upon landing on the pavement near 9th and Sunbury streets, the 5-foot, 3-inch, 
110-pound Broaden got up and continued to run, still clutching her baby. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after, officers arrested her. 
</P>
<P>
Police, who were interviewing Broaden late Monday, said they were trying to 
determine whether she had been the victim of a robbery. Beyond that, officers 
refused to speculate about the woman's motives and could not immediately 
provide any additional information about her background.

TRYING TO SHUCK 4-H'S CORNY IMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
VALLEY MEMBERSHIP FALLS DESPITE NATIONWIDE GROWTH IN URBAN AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In summers past, television and trouble filled most evenings for children at 
the San Fernando Gardens housing project in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
So when VISTA volunteer Rosa Roman started making phone calls and knocking on 
doors several months ago, gauging parents' interest in a pilot 4-H Club within 
the housing project, the response overwhelmed her. More than 190 children 
signed up, and 35 attended the club's first arts and crafts session in 
temporary Quonset hut quarters last week. 
</P>
<P>
The new club, which its leaders say provides one of the only diversions for the 
project's youths, shows the continuing shift in direction for the 4-H in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Created in 1900 to enable rural children to develop their "heads, hearts, hands 
and health" through community and individual projects, 4-H found itself in a 
precipitous membership dive nationally during most of the 1980s, said Andrew 
Buhler, spokesman for the National 4-H Council based in Chevy Chase, Md. 
</P>
<P>
That decline was mirrored in the increasingly urbanized San Fernando Valley, 
where in 1984 14 clubs had 400 members. Before the new club opened this month 
in the San Fernando Gardens, 4-H had only 90 children in its six remaining 
Valley clubs, some with fewer than a dozen members. 
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, the organization locally and nationally has sought 
new members not just for rural clubs, but also in housing projects and inner 
city school districts. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Gardens 4-H Club is one of nine programs operating in Los 
Angeles housing projects. Other cites include Imperial Courts , Mar Vista, Dana 
Strand and Ramona Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
To attract the city kids, activities such as astronomy, woodworking, gardening, 
cooking and working with computers, augmented more traditional projects such as 
raising livestock and growing vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Largely because of new clubs in low-income neighborhoods, 4-H membership in Los 
Angeles County is up, with 2,311 members during the 1988-89 fiscal year, 
compared to 1,593 in 1984-85. Riverside and San Bernardino counties, which saw 
declines in club membership from the mid-to-late 1980s, now are seeing a 
turnaround as well, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Araujo-Wilson, 4-H youth development adviser in Riverside County, said 
the organization is gradually adapting to new demographic challenges: holding 
club meetings during lunch for children bused to school, conducting 4-H 
leadership seminars in English and Spanish, and working with the NAACP and the 
Urban League to bring clubs to low-income neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the subject matter of 4-H has changed as well, said Buhler of the 
National 4-H Council, with clubs around the country conducting workshops on 
teen suicide, substance abuse and teen pregnancy. Some of the programs are in 
small, rural towns, but most are not, he said. In 1988, only 13.3% of the 
organization's national membership lived on farms. 
</P>
<P>
The newest 4-H Club in the San Fernando Valley has neither freckle-faced farm 
kids nor award-winning heifers, but its members seem as excited as any 
9-year-old planting his first beans in anticipation of the county fair. 
</P>
<P>
At the club's meeting last Thursday, Sandy Sanchez, 12, already had something 
to be proud of: a neatly stitched flower petal taking shape on an embroidery 
hoop. 
</P>
<P>
She also had been elected by the children gathered in the housing project's 
stuffy Head Start building to lead the arts and crafts group, which will meet 
daily from 5 to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"The teacher said we need a leader that wants to be a leader," she said 
proudly. "I got to be it." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy said she already likes 4-H, especially because it meets in the late 
afternoon. During the day, she said, she cares for her 2-month-old brother, and 
"I usually don't come outside." 
</P>
<P>
Deirdre Thompson, the county cooperative extension 4-H agent who oversees the 
new club, admitted there have been failures at some other housing projects 
because parent volunteers sometimes cannot be recruited, or because grants to 
pay for supplies and leaders' stipends were lost. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she is optimistic about the club in the San Fernando Gardens, 
because the housing project virtually has no other diversions for children, and 
parents fear letting them venture into the nearby neighborhoods for outside 
recreation programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We already have four adult volunteers and we've got a captive audience, so to 
speak," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
The arts and crafts project, the first undertaken by the new club, is only the 
beginning, said VISTA volunteer Roman, who lives in San Fernando Gardens. Under 
a cooperative agreement, VISTA volunteers help organize new clubs and provide 
early guidance. 
</P>
<P>
Projects soon will be established in camping, foods and nutrition and football, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here, they are real happy," Roman said. "They want the kids to 
learn something." 
</P>
<P>
4-H's new direction hasn't met with enthusiasm among longtime 4-H Club leaders, 
some of whom fear the new clubs in housing projects and inner-city schools will 
divert resources and staff attention away from agriculturally oriented clubs 
that also need help to survive. 
</P>
<P>
John Pusey, a Los Angeles County 4-H adviser, acknowledged a shift in resources 
has occurred. "We are a traditionally suburban and rural organization that is 
attempting to reach out to environments and economic groups that hadn't been 
reached before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nationally, regionally and locally, everyone is working to decide, what is the 
best direction for 4-H to take? Where will 4-H be most effective?" Pusey said.

The striking beauty of Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photographs makes them 
irresistible from the very first glance. 
</P>
<P>
But their mysterious content is what keeps you looking. 
</P>
<P>
"Revelaciones: The Art of Manuel Alvarez Bravo," a retrospective of 113 
black-and-white photographs, opened last week at the Museum of Photographic 
Arts in Balboa Park and continues through Sept. 9. The show validates once more 
the 88-year-old Mexican artist's reputation as one of the greatest 
photographers of this century. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by Arthur Ollman, the museum's executive director, along with Nissan 
Perez, curator of photographs at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, this 
exhibition is more than just a survey of Alvarez Bravo's work since the 1920s. 
It also is a reminder that sensuality and political content can easily coexist 
in a single image, that matters of life and death can be treated simultaneously 
with humor and pathos, and that a single work of art is capable of expressing 
vast numbers of layered meanings. 
</P>
<P>
"Public Thirst," for example, a work from 1933, shows a young boy crouching on 
a ledge to drink from an outdoor water fountain. It's an everyday image, hardly 
a grand statement. From his bearing, you get the feeling that the child is a 
resourceful character, but still, he's just an ordinary boy, barefooted yet 
well-dressed in wrinkled but clean white slacks and shirt. And Alvarez Bravo 
doesn't succumb to the pitfalls of cute 
</P>
<P>
ness that ruin so many pictures of children -- the boy's head is turned away, 
he is anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The work's title indicates that there's more to this image than the kind of 
ordinary incident that has preoccupied photographers like Henri 
Cartier-Bresson, for example. This boy, whose dark skin identifies him as a 
native Mexican, is one of Alvarez Bravo's symbols for the Mexican people. And 
yet, as Perez points out in his essay in the catalogue for the show, the boy 
also represents young Mayan boys who once were sacrificed to quench the thirst 
of their gods. To make the connection between life and death, sacrifice and 
nourishment, the artist always pairs this work with a bloody image titled 
"Striking worker, assassinated," from 1934; in the latter a teen-age boy lies 
dead in the street, a victim and martyr whose face is stained by a fountain of 
blood that flows from his wounds. There is a parallel between the flow of the 
water and the flow of the blood. The ancient martyrdom of Mayan males is 
equated with the image of a contemporary political martyr. Youth is not a safe 
time, Alvarez Bravo seems to say. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez Bravo's style is rooted both in Mexican history -- with its 
pre-Columbian and Spanish mix of religious and pagan symbols -- and in European 
art history, particularly surrealism. But, generally, he doesn't divide his 
focus in one direction or the other. Modern and ancient, mundane and sacred 
blend gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the iconography seems somewhat obvious, though it's never simple. 
"Coatlicue," 1987, pairs two sculptures in a bed of wild flowers. The first, a 
small pre-Columbian fertility sculpture of a woman, nestles the second, a folk 
art plaster skeleton in its arms. It is a pose that alludes to, and perhaps 
even mocks, the iconic Christian image of Mary holding the dead Christ in her 
arms. Alvarez Bravo's skeleton is like those commonly used on the Mexican Day 
of the Dead holy day to symbolize the return to earth of dead relatives. It is 
also just one of the many signs indicating Mexican culture's blending of 
Christian ritual and Mayan beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, though, Alvarez Bravo's meanings are tough to decipher. More often 
than not, hints of deeper meaning are suggested only cryptically through 
titles. And the titles can be poetic, but still illegible to those who don't 
know much about Mexican culture, which is why the explanatory wall texts 
provided are so important and helpful in this exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
"The Daughter of Dancers," for example, is a picture of a woman in traditional 
Mexican dress looking through a round window in a decorative brick wall; she 
stands in an odd posture, on her toes with one foot on top of the other. Perez 
explains that the title refers not only to dancers, but also to a kind of 
Mexican architectural carving, and that the woman is meant to be both an 
archetypal Mexican woman, and a reference to an indigenous Mexican art form. 
</P>
<P>
More often than not Alvarez Bravo's photographs are composed with a strong 
central image, so that the eye is drawn first to the abstract qualities of the 
compositions. He is a master at using light and dark passages to highlight his 
sense of mystery and draw out the sculptural qualities in his subjects. A 
portrait of Carlos Fuentes, for example, shows the figure's face half obscured 
by shadow. 
</P>
<P>
There are obvious debts in this work. For example, many of Alvarez Bravo's 
nudes where he shows just the female torso are clearly reminiscent of Edward 
Weston's work. And his experiments with X-rays represented by two images here 
owe much to the surrealist Man Ray. But despite such clear references, Alvarez 
Bravo adds his own flavor. His voluptuous subjects look like primitive 
fertility figures, not classical nudes, for example. His X-ray pictures are 
spiced with black humor. 
</P>
<P>
What remains surprising in a show spanning six decades of work is the 
consistency of the artist's interests and stylistic devices throughout. 
Happily, Alvarez Bravo's peculiar mix of patriotism and humor, mythology and 
life, has changed very little over the years. Alvarez Bravo knows how to 
provoke. And he knows how to please the eye. 
</P>
<P>
He's done both well for a very long time. After closing in San Diego, the 
exhibition travels on a two-year national tour to San Francisco, Detroit, 
Kansas City, Kan., Santa Barbara, Haverford, Pa., Coral Gables, Fla., and 
Cambridge, Mass.

COALITION WILL TRY STAR POWER ON NEA; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: ENTERTAINMENT ACTIVISTS PLAN A 'SWAT-TEAM' APPROACH TO INFLUENCE UPCOMING 
LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A show-business activist group has asked for six to 10 volunteers from among 
the entertainment industry's biggest stars to form a "SWAT team" to drum up 
support for the beleaguered National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal by the Creative Coalition, a New York-based activist organization 
of motion picture, theater and music business celebrities, emerged Sunday 
evening at a private meeting in Beverly Hills dominated by film industry 
figures. The meeting was a standing room-only affair that drew more than 100 
people to the auditorium of Creative Artists Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Attending were producer Norman Lear, political pollster Pat Caddell, 
choreographer Bella Lewitzky and a range of actors including Michael O'Keefe, 
Jean Stapleton, Sarah Jessica Parker, Hal Linden, Justine Bateman, Robert 
Downey Jr., and Lesley Ann Warren. The meeting was the final event in a weekend 
campaign fund-raising trip by Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.) chairman of a House 
NEA reauthorization subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by the People for the American Way organization, 
which Lear founded 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Creative Coalition proposal was disclosed by actor Stephen Collins, who 
urged the Southern California show business community to avoid a mistake 
Collins said it made in the 1950s when motion picture stars and executives 
failed to act aggressively against the blacklisting movement. 
</P>
<P>
Collins and other Creative Coalition officials conceded that the strategy has 
something of a desperation flavor since floor votes are expected in the House 
and Senate on key NEA legislation in the next three weeks. Final congressional 
action on both NEA reauthorization and reappropriation are is not expected 
until September or October. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood did not do itself proud with the Hollywood 10," said Collins. He 
drew parallels between the blacklisting of screenwriters, producers and 
directors in the 1950s and the current NEA controversy, in which grants have 
been cut off to controversial performance artists. Other artists have rejected 
grants, including Lewitzky, who turned back $72,000 in NEA funding (she also 
once refused to answer questions by the House Un-American Activities 
Committee). 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Hollywood Establishment) were very slow to get into (the political 
threat posed by Sen. Joseph McCarthy)," Collins said. "We're in this same 
situation now." 
</P>
<P>
The SWAT-team strategy, Collins said, would rely on identification of as many 
as 10 "huge celebrities with enormous middle-American appeal," who would 
undergo crash briefings to make them aware of the minute details of the NEA 
crisis. The superstars would then be sent to Washington and home state offices 
of key politicians, and would conduct press interviews in support of renewing 
the endowment without restrictions on the kinds of artworks it can support. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said no mega-stars have been signed up for such a team, but he said the 
Creative Coalition hopes that its members would be figures not normally 
identified as political activists -- or at least not politically active within 
a traditionally liberal context. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Creative Coalition is determined to avoid a mistake common to 
political campaigns that involve show business figures, only to discover that 
the celebrities lack sufficient factual background in the cause with which they 
are identified. "We tend to be passionate with the press," Collins said, "but 
not well enough informed." 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the challenge was illustrated indirectly by an exchange between 
Williams and film and television ("Family Ties,") actress Bateman, who last 
year performed in a Berkeley Repertory Theatre production of "Lulu." Bateman 
said she was confused about how the NEA controversy had come to be so prominent 
since she grew up in a social system in which her contemporaries believed such 
issues as freedom of speech and abortion rights had been long ago resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 24 years old," she told the veteran Montana congressman, "and it seems so 
silly that we (even) have to talk about this." 
</P>
<P>
Collins said the SWAT team strategy would be combined with a parallel tactical 
move involving celebrities who were born or raised in 15 target states in which 
congressmen and senators hold crucial undecided votes on pending endowment 
reauthorization and appropriation bills. 
</P>
<P>
The Creative Coalition said it already has nearly 300 actors and actresses who 
have been identified for duty in which they would either agree to go to their 
home states for a day, or spend a day doing telephone interviews with news 
outlets in the key states -- including Missouri, Texas, Ohio, Michigan, 
Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Illinois and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Caddell told the group that the NEA situation has reached such a critical mass 
that any Hollywood political response must necessarily be based on 
sophisticated understanding of political factors involved. "There has to be a 
political strategy," Caddell observed. "You can't let (Sen.) Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) and these people take the issue to their (home) grounds (and seize 
dominant positions in the debate). When you hurt them politically, all of this 
will go away."

dress sold at Time After Time last week. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker and Harrington were among 238 unknown and mostly unknown actors -- and 
teachers and engineers and landscapers -- who on Monday answered an open 
casting call put out by CBS for a television movie about the courtship and 
early marriage of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they formed a pre-dawn procession of redheads and pompadoured Latino 
men, singing the "I Love Lucy" theme, exchanging Lucy trivia and occasionally 
belting out an "Ethel!" or a mumbled line of beleaguered Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they'll pick an unknown to do the part," said Tony Rael, who had been 
waiting since 5 a.m. for a chance to audition as Desi. "To show that it can 
still be done." 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban-born Rael, who teaches art at an elementary school in Bel-Air, earned 
a callback by singing, "I love Lucy and she loves me/We're as happy as we can 
be" -- which he had learned while waiting his turn in the CBS parking lot -- 
for producer Larry Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, whose Larry Thompson Organization is producing "Lucy &amp; Desi: 
Before the Laughter" for CBS, said Monday's cattle call, along with similar 
sessions in Miami and New York later this week, are part of an earnest effort 
to find unknown actors to play the famous pair. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of the fact that so many people in America and around the world have 
such an image of what these people look like, we'd like to cast people who 
don't bring their own fame to the role," said Thompson. A well-known face 
"would get in the way" of audience acceptance of the cast, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the glittery, choreographed audition process might 
engender a little publicity, but insisted that the purpose was really to 
discover the perfect Lucy and Desi. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been getting calls from everything from a woman who said she was Lucy 
incarnate and had to play the part, to a woman from Australia who wanted 
directions to my office," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
By noon Monday the producer had sat through dozens of renditions of the 
"Vitametavegamin" skit from the "I Love Lucy" episode in which the star 
auditioned for a TV commercial for an alcohol-laced health serum. 
</P>
<P>
"I am learning what I don't want," Thompson said with a tired smile. 
</P>
<P>
During the auditions, Thompson and his casting director, Holly Powell, were all 
politeness and encouragement, answering each "Do you poop out at parties?" with 
such Hollywood expressions as "That was very exciting" and "You certainly are 
well-prepared." 
</P>
<P>
If the Lucys were selling bottles of peppy pepper-upper, Desis tended to 
audition with a song. 
</P>
<P>
 They call me Cuban Pete 
</P>
<P>
 I'm the king of the rumba beat 
</P>
<P>
 Every night I go chick chickaboom, chick chickaboom, chick chickaboom. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Aguirre, an engineer/actor, wasn't disappointed when his version of 
Cuban Pete didn't merit a callback. 
</P>
<P>
"I came today hoping to get a souvenir," Aguirre said. He held up a yellow 
ticket with his audition number, 13, printed on it. "I got this. I was kind of 
hoping it would say, 'The great Lucy and Desi search' on it, but it just says 
13.' " 
</P>
<P>
No one in the crowd looked more like Desi than Bill Reyes, a manufacturing 
engineer/drummer from Oceanside who prepared the scene in which Desi explained 
to a judge why Lucy wrapped up a hunk of cheese as if it were a baby. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, in the lot, Reyes had led a half-dozen Desis, posed like a line of 
old-fashioned soul singers, in the "Lucy" theme for clicking photographers and 
whirring TV cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Even Roberto Lopez, better known as El Vez, the Mexican Elvis, showed up. "I'm 
a natural," he declared with his usual bravado. "I figure, I didn't get to play 
little Ricky as a kid, so I should at least have a shot at playing Desi now, 
right?" 
</P>
<P>
The life of Desi Arnaz is the subject of another production currently in the 
works, a stage musical by the daughter of the comic duo, Lucie Arnaz. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Arnaz expressed displeasure that CBS was planning to air Thompson's 
movie, saying that "the climate is wrong" to do the story of her parents' 
romance. She said that she had extremely mixed emotions about the film, despite 
CBS insistence that it will not be exploitative. 
</P>
<P>
And while the scene at CBS could have easily been taken from one of Lucy's own 
skits, with hopeful actresses tripping over themselves to get a crack at 
stardom, the crowd at Monday's audition was not nearly the size Thompson's 
public-relations representatives had hoped for. Press releases sent out by CBS 
and the Thompson Organization had invited reporters and photographers to 
witness a spectacle involving an anticipated 1,500 redheads and Cuban 
bandleaders. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the open calls, Thompson has scheduled private interviews for 29 
better-known actresses who have expressed a desire to play Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The actresses are mostly very famous, he said, and all hungry for the part. 
</P>
<P>
But he wouldn't say who had auditioned, or whether their Vitametavegamin girl 
was any better than the ones seen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He was still looking. 
</P>
<P>
"Meryl Streep hasn't called," he said.

'GHOST' PERFORMING SOLIDLY AT THE BOX OFFICE 
</P>

Twentieth Century Fox's "Die Hard 2" continued to pace the nation's movie box 
office attendance with second weekend grosses of $14.5 million, but it was the 
performance of Paramount Pictures' romantic fantasy, "Ghost," that got most of 
the industry's attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghost," which stars Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore as a couple so in love that 
death can't even do them part, took in $12.1 million at 1,101 screens. The film 
averaged $11,073 per screen, the second highest opening weekend average of the 
summer, and showed that audiences are ready for a little counterprogramming in 
a summer jammed with action. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, both Fox's "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane," starring 
controversial Andrew Dice Clay as a "rock 'n' roll detective" and Warner Bros.' 
Bill Murray comedy, "Quick Change," had disappointing debuts. "Fairlane" had 
ticket sales of $6.3 million at 1,245 screens, for a $5,120 per-screen average 
and fifth place. "Quick Change" earned $4.7 million at 1,595 screens, for a 
weak per-screen average of $2,947 and seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Paramount's racing drama "Days of Thunder" dropped another 24% in 
its third weekend. "Thunder," a love story about a stock car racer (Tom Cruise) 
and the neurosurgeon (Nicole Kidman) who treats him for a head injury, had 
ticket sales of $8.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Studios' reissue of "Jungle Book" was fourth with ticket sales of 
$7.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the weekend's Top 10: Disney's "Dick Tracy" was sixth with $4.8 
million ($90 million cumulative); Tri-Star's "Total Recall" was eighth with 
$3.2 million ($104.8 million); Paramount's "Another 48 HRS." was ninth with 
$2.9 million ($71 million) and Universal's "The Jetsons" was 10th with $2.8 
million ($10.8 million). 
</P>
<P>
"Ghost" figures to continue to do well, if results of an audience exit poll 
conducted by Cinemascore are any indication of the kind of word of mouth it is 
getting. The movie was rated A by an audience that was dominated by women over 
25. 
</P>
<P>
The exit results for "Ford Fairlane" were less encouraging for Fox. The movie 
got a B rating from audiences made up primarily of males (68%).

10 YEARS ON ROAD TO GLORY; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: THE AFL TOOK ROOT IN 1960 AND QUICKLY WAS MALIGNED. BUT BY 1970, IT 
HAD BECOME A THORN DEEP IN THE SIDE OF NFL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They were born the Los Angeles Chargers in 1960, and they were one of eight 
charter members of what lived for 10 years as the American Football League. 
They were born winning. 
</P>
<P>
In that difficult first season, the Chargers, with Sid Gillman coaching, won 10 
of 14 regular-season games to finish first in their division. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles wasn't interested. When the turnout for the club's third home 
game was even smaller than earlier crowds -- which had averaged fewer than 
5,000 in the 100,000-seat Coliseum -- a Charger assistant, Jack Faulkner, 
approached Gillman with a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's save some time today," Faulkner said as they stood glumly on the 
sideline shortly before the kickoff. "Instead of announcing the starting 
lineups, let's just send the players up into the stands to shake hands with the 
crowd." 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, the AFL saw Faulkner's point. 
</P>
<P>
As the Chargers prepared for the AFL's first title game at the Coliseum -- 
against the Eastern champion Houston Oilers -- the site was abruptly changed to 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in our best interests," said AFL Commissioner Joe Foss. 
</P>
<P>
Gillman and Charger owner Barron Hilton agreed, even though it cost them the 
home-field advantage and possibly the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Chargers) had already lost $900,000," Gillman recalled at his home here 
recently. "The Coliseum is a historic place, but in those days, playing the 
championship game in a new league, we made more money on a high school field in 
Houston than we could ever make in the Coliseum." 
</P>
<P>
That was the AFL in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
That's how it was at the start of the AFL decade -- 1960-69 -- when, as the NFL 
doubled up laughing, the new league was commonly referred to as "the other 
league." 
</P>
<P>
No more. 
</P>
<P>
No more jeers. And no more AFL -- although, at the end of the AFL decade, it 
was the NFL that sued for peace, taking in all 10 of the other league's clubs. 
As former AFL quarterback Joe Namath said from his home in Florida, "We had the 
last laugh." 
</P>
<P>
So in 1990, AFL buffs are celebrating two anniversaries: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was 30 years ago that their league was founded by a tough young Texan, 
Lamar Hunt, who still owns the Kansas City Chiefs. In cooperation with his 
equally ambitious partners, Hunt proved that with persistence, skill and luck, 
a group as ornery as the NFL of the 1960s can be had. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was 20 years ago that the two leagues completed the merger that forged 
the modern NFL that included, among other things, the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Bowl is here because, although the NFL wanted nothing to do with the 
other league, the AFL insisted on playing it. AFL founder Hunt even gave it its 
name. 
</P>
<P>
By 1970, the AFL, renamed the American Football Conference and joined by the 
Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Colts and Cleveland Browns, had become the 
stronger half of the merged NFL. Teams representing AFL and AFC franchises won 
11 Super Bowls in the first 13 years after the Green Bay Packers won the first 
two in 1967 and '68. 
</P>
<P>
The AFL-NFL merger wasn't universally applauded, however. It was bitterly 
opposed by many of those who lived and died with the AFL. 
</P>
<P>
From Buffalo to Oakland, there were, by the late 1960s, thousands of anti-NFL, 
pro-AFL fans. 
</P>
<P>
By then, it was obvious that the NFL was crying uncle. When Al Davis, the last 
AFL commissioner, began luring NFL quarterbacks, it was obvious that the NFL's 
club owners had been outmaneuvered. 
</P>
<P>
The change from the AFL's first season was breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, Lamar Hunt had begun operations as unsteadily as the founder of any 
other league, losing Los Angeles quickly, and almost New York. 
</P>
<P>
In the West, the Chargers, although they hit the divisional title target with 
their first shot, were obliged to flee after the 1960 season to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In the East, things looked worse. The owner of the New York franchise, Harry 
Wismer, could only afford one place for a box office -- the dining room of his 
own apartment. 
</P>
<P>
As Hunt tells it, he approved that piece of daffiness simply because the 
apartment was on Park Avenue. What Hunt didn't know -- what few knew -- was 
that the only entrance to the Wismer building was on 48th Street, where hardly 
anyone could find it. 
</P>
<P>
A day or two before the first AFL game, one persistent New York fan finally 
located the right elevator and then the right apartment, and he was met at the 
apartment door by Wismer's blonde maid, who spoke Swedish but not much English. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the AFL's first crisis, and we blew it," Hunt said. "The maid was 
getting Wismer's dinner on the table and couldn't be bothered selling tickets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE BABY-SITTERS 
</P>
<P>
The AFL team that became the Kansas City Chiefs, winning Super Bowl IV under 
Coach Hank Stram, began as the Dallas Texans and played in Hunt's hometown for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Stram said he will never forget the first year, when the Texans, scheduling a 
tryout camp, attracted hundreds of bartenders, cowboys and others who thought 
they could play football. 
</P>
<P>
Wondering how to cut them to a manageable number, Stram noticed that club owner 
Hunt had brought his warm-up shorts to camp and was getting set to work out 
himself, starting with the 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
When he ran it in 5.1 seconds, Stram was inspired. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, you receivers and backs," Stram yelled. "We're cutting everybody that 
can't run faster than the owner." 
</P>
<P>
If that's how Stram and Hunt put their first-year team together, the job soon 
got more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL saw to that, launching a spring campaign to corner the rookie talent 
market. In the week of the draft, NFL scouts identified the nation's top 25 
college players and assigned 25 staff employees to watch over them. 
</P>
<P>
Known as baby-sitters, these staffers used remote hotels and resorts, for the 
most part, as places to stash the players, keeping them away from AFL teams 
until NFL teams could draft and sign them. 
</P>
<P>
One day, when Hunt broke through a cordon of baby-sitters and made 
long-distance contact with a college quarterback, Roman Gabriel, he was 
dismayed but not put off by the young prospect's hourlong effort to get a full 
disclosure of AFL plans for high choices. 
</P>
<P>
As Hunt recalls, Gabriel, on the telephone from his college room, would ask: 
"What's the biggest signing bonus you're prepared to offer a quarterback?" 
</P>
<P>
And Hunt would reply: "I really shouldn't say, but for a great one such as 
yourself, we can go high (as $25,000)." 
</P>
<P>
Years later Hunt learned that he had never actually talked with Gabriel. The 
voice on the phone in his room was that of Gabriel's weekend guest, Elroy 
Hirsch, the inquisitive general manager of the Rams, who already had Gabriel 
under contract. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like war," Hunt said of that era. "And I think it made the AFL a viable 
league. The cloak-and-dagger stuff captured the public's imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt seemed personally miscast -- much too easygoing to start a war, let alone 
run one. When he organized his league, Hunt, a former second-string pass 
receiver at Southern Methodist, was the self-effacing, 27-year-old son of a 
billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years later, he looks much the same. Slight, smiling, bespectacled, he 
projects none of the steeliness that has been underneath all along. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was there anything remarkable about the way he founded the AFL. Sports 
promoters have been challenging the haughty NFL with new leagues for most of 
the century, most recently with the World Football League and United States 
Football League, among others. A 1940s challenger was the All-America 
Conference, which in the end contributed the San Francisco 49ers and Cleveland 
Browns to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
And in the NFL's first 50 years, five American Football Leagues rose to fight 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's was merely the fifth, but also the most distinctive. His was the one 
that lasted, and, in time, pried its way en masse into a greatly enlarged NFL. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't come easily. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt became a league founder only because the NFL declined, in 1959, to sell 
him an expansion franchise for Dallas. The NFL that year had only 12 clubs. 
</P>
<P>
But when Hunt formed the AFL in early 1960 with partners in seven other cities, 
the NFL hurriedly decided to expand after all. 
</P>
<P>
The AFL called it Operation Sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
First, the NFL created the Dallas Cowboys and put them in Hunt's town, an 
attempt to break the new league by hurting the AFL founder where it hurt the 
most. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL awarded the Cowboy franchise less than a year after telling Hunt that 
it wouldn't expand to Dallas, or anywhere, under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the NFL created the Minnesota Vikings, handing the franchise to Hunt's 
Minneapolis partners and costing the AFL its only base in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
As it happened, the AFL's club owners were meeting in Minneapolis the day that 
the NFL outflanked them there. And at dinner that night, the New York owner, 
Wismer, looked across the table at the principal Minneapolis owner, Max Winter, 
and said, softly but distinctly, "Nice going, Judas." 
</P>
<P>
When Winter sprang to his feet, Wismer, as he told it later, ignored him and 
addressed the other owners. 
</P>
<P>
"Boys, this is the last supper," he said sourly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE TURNING POINT 
</P>
<P>
At a poker game in Texas one night in 1961, one of the players, between deals, 
put an idle question to his neighbor, wealthy oilman H.L. Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"How long can that boy of yours afford to blow his money on a football league?" 
the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
"How much he losin'?" Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Bout a million a year, I hear," the man replied. 
</P>
<P>
"That much?" Hunt said. "At that rate, I only give him another 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
They say in Texas that that's the true version of a story going around in the 
early days when, reportedly, Lamar Hunt kept bailing out the AFL's weaker 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was most acute in New York, where Hunt needed to make a television 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
Joe McGuff, a former Kansas City sportswriter, now the editor of the Kansas 
City Star, remembers Wismer was going broke but wouldn't quit. 
</P>
<P>
So AFL Commissioner Foss called a league meeting at New York's Waldorf Hotel, 
and, having decided to force Wismer out, arrived from his Dallas office with a 
pack of incriminating files that would prove his case. 
</P>
<P>
That was a blow to Wismer, a canny type who, buying time before confronting 
Foss, got the Waldorf bell desk on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
According to McGuff, Wismer identified himself as Joe Foss, and, giving the 
bell captain Foss' room number, explained that an emergency had developed and 
he had to return home. 
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't have time to come by and pick up his luggage, but to close 
the bags, send them to the airport and get them on a flight to Dallas. Then, 
promising a big tip, Wismer rang off. 
</P>
<P>
When Foss found his room empty, he had to cancel the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
That saved Wismer for a while. By 1963, however, his club was so far in the 
hole that the AFL took over and resold it to Sonny Werblin, the showman who 
brought in Joe Namath. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting Werblin was the (AFL's) turning point," Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
Not until the 1964 television negotiations did that become clear. The order of 
events that winter: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Negotiating for the NFL, Commissioner Pete Rozelle got CBS to triple its 
rights fees to $1 million per year per club -- an unheard-of TV sports sum 
until then. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At almost the same time, ABC dealt the other league what seemed to be a 
final blow, canceling the last season of its AFL contract. After four years, 
Hunt's league, it seemed, was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 -- But, in what has been called the worst television deal ever made, NBC 
contracted not only to take on the AFL but to pay each club $1 million a year, 
matching the NFL's package. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't believe it," an AFL coach said at the time. "NBC could have had 
us for 15 cents, give or take a nickel." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Hunt sees it differently. 
</P>
<P>
"NBC did the smart thing," he said. "Most of our clubs needed big money from TV 
to compete with the NFL. It was a smart business move for NBC to have a strong 
AFL, and Werblin was the guy who made them realize that." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly on a par, financially, with the older league, the AFL got another 
break when the NFL's New York Giants signed an AFL kicker, Pete Gogolak, who 
had finished his option season at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the reserve-option restrictions of all clubs in both leagues had 
been honored. Indeed, AFL and NFL owners scrupulously avoided the inter-league 
raids that would have led to wage escalations. 
</P>
<P>
College prospects were another matter. The competing clubs fought bitterly over 
All-Americans such as Billy Cannon -- who was signed by both leagues -- and 
Mike Garrett, who had always wanted to play for the Rams, but was coaxed into 
the AFL. 
</P>
<P>
But the Gogolak signing was something new. The AFL then elected as commissioner 
Al Davis -- who was hired to frighten the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
That he did. 
</P>
<P>
And from that moment on, peace was inevitable, although it came slowly. First, 
at the end of the 1966 season, came Super Bowl I. Next, interleague exhibitions 
in 1967. Then interleague regular-season games in 1970. And, finally, 10 years 
of cash indemnities. 
</P>
<P>
As AFL representative to the peace commission, Hunt had committed his league to 
$18 million to NFL owners in the two-team areas, New York and the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
The very idea enraged AFL partisans. Any indemnity was a needless gift, they 
charged, and one day a group of them got together in Dallas to honor Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
They named him Bonehead of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE UNDERDOGS 
</P>
<P>
Near downtown Los Angeles, in a new auditorium called the Sports Arena, John F. 
Kennedy was nominated for the Presidency that summer in 1960. The Rams went to 
training camp with a new coach, Bob Waterfield. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Los Angeles' citizens were then talking about building more freeways. 
Meantime, they were still riding the red streetcars. 
</P>
<P>
In Denver, the financially strapped AFL Broncos played football in second-hand 
uniforms, which they had purchased from a Copper Bowl college team. 
</P>
<P>
The uniforms had arrived complete with vivid yellow socks that had vertical 
brown stripes. Candy stripes, they were called. 
</P>
<P>
"The Denver team was embarrassed," said AFL veteran Jack Faulkner, now a Ram 
executive. "The players even offered to pay for proper socks themselves but 
were turned down." 
</P>
<P>
When Faulkner moved to Denver in 1962 as the Bronco coach, he put first things 
first, building a bonfire on opening day and burning all the candy stripes. 
</P>
<P>
"All but one pair," he said. "We sent one sock to the Hall of Fame, and I kept 
one to hang up at Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Within 10 years, however, the AFL was playing better football than the 
50-year-old NFL. 
</P>
<P>
The athlete who first demonstrated that was the $400,000 quarterback, Namath, 
one of the first since Babe Ruth to make a fortune playing a game. 
</P>
<P>
With Namath as their leader, the AFL's 1968 New York Jets went into Super Bowl 
III as an 18-point underdog and won, 16-7, against the NFL champion Baltimore 
Colts, who, 13-1 that season, had romped past such NFL powers as the Chicago 
Bears, Vikings, 49ers, Giants and Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Namath had predicted victory, had even guaranteed it, but it was still 
difficult to grasp. In one afternoon, the Jets completely changed national 
perception. 
</P>
<P>
In one afternoon, proving that AFL football was at least as good as NFL 
football, the Jets made the Super Bowl into what it is today. 
</P>
<P>
Before Namath, most fans had agreed with Vince Lombardi, coach of the Green Bay 
Packers, that the AFL's 10 teams were plucky but weak. 
</P>
<P>
"(Super Bowl III) meant something else to me," Namath said of the game. "I 
think of it as a win for all the underdogs of the world. A lot of them wrote me 
that year. They said: 'If you could do it, I can do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
And how did the Jets do it? 
</P>
<P>
At his Carlsbad home, Gillman, a Hall of Famer talking about a Hall of Famer, 
said: "Namath came to the Super Bowl as the champion of a slightly better 
league. The AFL was playing a different and better game on offense and defense 
both. 
</P>
<P>
"(AFL) owners wanted excitement, so the AFL threw the ball -- and found that 
that's the best way to win, too. 
</P>
<P>
"To control the pass, our defensive coaches invented sophisticated modern 
blitzing. This gave the AFL a leg up when it began interleague play against the 
NFL." 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s, however, the differences weren't immediately reflected by ticket 
sales. In the beginning, worried AFL owners often resorted to gimmick 
promotions. For example, Hunt's team admitted every barber in town free of 
charge to one game 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Most barbers are good conversationalists who have a lot to say," Hunt said, 
recalling his first AFL season. "We wanted them talking about us." 
</P>
<P>
And they did. 
</P>
<P>
"But unfortunately, our next crowd was even smaller," he said. "The barbers 
bad-mouthed us all week."

HE'S STILL PROFITING FROM VICTORY IN 1989; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: SINCE WINNING THE BRITISH OPEN LAST YEAR, MARK CALCAVECCHIA HAS BEEN 
RECEIVING SIX-FIGURE APPEARANCE FEES TO PLAY OVERSEAS. 
</P>

<P>
Mark Calcavecchia might flinch when recalling his disappointing finish in the 
Greater Hartford Open, but he is delighted to discuss his victory in the 
British Open 51 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"What did winning it do for me?" he said. "Made me money." 
</P>
<P>
As in Brink's armored car loads. Before winning the title he will defend 
starting Thursday at St. Andrews Golf Club in Scotland, Calcavecchia said he 
felt fortunate to receive a $20,000 guarantee to play in the 1989 Swiss Open. 
</P>
<P>
Now his appearance fee is approaching those of Greg Norman, Curtis Strange and 
Seve Ballesteros. At the Irish Open three weeks ago, Calcavecchia received 
$100,000 just to play (he won an additional $54,000 after tying for second). 
He'll receive another $100,000 for playing in the Dutch Open the week after the 
British Open, and he has a $125,000 deal to play in Japan this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"People asked me why I played in the Irish Open, and I said because it was a 
great golf course (Portmarnock) and they made me a great offer," Calcavecchia 
said. "Same with the Dutch Open and the tournaments I'm going to do in Japan, 
where the people are golf-crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't pay me that much, but if people are generous enough, you've got to 
be a dummy not to take that kind of cash. If someone says, 'Want $100,000 to 
play in our tournament?' what are you going to say? I don't want to play in the 
Dutch Open, but I've heard the course is pretty good and I know the money's 
great." 
</P>
<P>
And to think Calcavecchia hasn't won since his four-hole playoff victory over 
Norman and Wayne Grady at Royal Troon Golf Club in Scotland last year. He tied 
for second in the Irish Open and has five runner-up finishes this year on the 
PGA Tour, including a crushing loss at Hartford two weeks ago, when he finished 
double bogey-bogey to tie with three others, two strokes behind winner Wayne 
Levi. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the most disappointing because I'd gone back and thought about what 
I'd done wrong and wasn't going to let it happen again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All the close calls have helped earn Calcavecchia $717,754 in official money, 
third on the money list. But the outside activities have added significantly to 
the bankroll of a man who five years ago was occasionally caddying for close 
friend Ken Green and wondering where he was headed. Part of his new riches paid 
for a 9,100-square-foot house in Phoenix that has 70 doors, six bedrooms and 
nine bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"I make all the final decisions, but I've got an agent in Florida (Robert 
Fraley) who screens all my offers because there's something I could be doing 
every week," Calcavecchia said. "There's always someone calling from a place 
like Champaign, Ill., offering $10,000 for a one-day pro-am, but Robert knows I 
don't want to do that kind of thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a $100,000 offer to play in the French Open opposite the GHO (where he 
won $66,000). It's all pretty amazing because I'm not begging people to play in 
their tournaments, they're coming to me. Before I won the British Open, the 
biggest thing I got was $20,000 for the Swiss Open last year. I didn't even 
consider Japan for that kind of money. Now I can go pretty much where I want. 
It's been the ultimate in opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
One can only wonder what riches Calcavecchia will reap if he repeats as British 
Open champion, on a course he believes is much to his liking and game. If he 
wins Sunday, he'll probably have to beat challenges from Norman, Strange, 
Ballesteros (who won the last British Open at St. Andrews, in 1984), Masters 
champion Nick Faldo, U.S. Open winner Hale Irwin, PGA titleholder Payne 
Stewart, Paul Azinger, Fred Couples, Tom Kite, Jose-Maria Olazabal, Ian Woosnam 
and, perhaps, Senior PGA Tour stars Lee Trevino and Jack Nicklaus, who won at 
St. Andrews in '78. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia has played seven rounds at St. Andrews, five in the Dunhill Cup in 
October when he shot 19-under par to spark the American team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great about going back there because I really like the place," 
Calcavecchia said. "I've had no problem reading the greens and have a feel for 
the course already, because I know where all the humps and hidden bunkers are 
and all the targets you have to aim at off the tee. 
</P>
<P>
"Going into some British Opens, you have no idea what the place is going to 
look like. When I got to Royal Lytham two years ago, I didn't like it from the 
first hole (he missed the cut). Last year, I played one practice round at 
Troon, got out to the seventh hole and said, 'Hey, there hasn't been a stupid 
one yet.' " 
</P>
<P>
Of St. Andrews, he said: "I think the course favors a long hitter and not 
necessarily a straight driver. Obviously, you have to putt well to win a 
tournament, but I'd give the advantage to the guy who hits the heck out of it."

JOHNSON BEATS BURRELL IN 200; LEWIS EXTENDS NINE-YEAR STREAK

Michael Johnson beat the season's top sprinter, Leroy Burrell, in the 200 
meters at the Barcelona Invitational track meet Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was timed in 20.06 seconds, Burrell in 20.14. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell's best event is the 100 meters, in which he has the season's best time, 
9.96. Burrell is preparing for a showdown at that distance against two-time 
Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis during the Goodwill Games at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who hasn't raced Burrell this season, competed only in the long jump 
Monday night, extending his nine-year winning streak in the event with a leap 
of 27 feet 11 inches. Robert Emmiyan of the Soviet Union was second at 27-3 
3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and Burrell also helped the Santa Monica Track Club win the 400-meter 
relay in 37.95 seconds. Cuba was second in 39.10. 
</P>
<P>
With Burrell skipping the 100, Mike Marsh won in 10.17, 0.04 seconds better 
than runner-up Mark Witherspoon. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic bronze medalist Danny Everett won the 400 meters in 44.78. Andrew 
Valmon was second in 45.32. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ereng of Kenya, the Olympic 800-meter champion, won the metric half-mile 
in 1:43.78. 
</P>
<P>
The slump of British sprinter Linford Christie continued when he was beaten by 
Nigerian newcomer Oladape Adeniken in an invitational meet at Belfast, Northern 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
The 100-meter loss was the fifth in a two-week period for Christie, the silver 
medalist at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Adeniken led from start to finish and was timed in 10.17 to 10.19 for Christie.

GARY IS READY TO GET INTO SWING OF THINGS; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: HE STRUGGLED AS A MINOR LEAGUER FOR EXPOS, BUT APPEARS READY TO IMPROVE 
HIS STATISTICS AS SECOND-YEAR TAILBACK. 
</P>

Tailback Cleveland Gary swore he wouldn't talk baseball Monday when he reported 
to the Rams' camp. 
</P>
<P>
Turns out he couldn't stay off of the subject for five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it," Gary said of baseball. "As a matter of fact, I love it. I really 
love it. Actually, I'm a big kid, but I'm in the real world, doing something I 
enjoy doing. I'm a very competitive football player as well as a baseball 
player. I'm just having a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Gary played left field and designated hitter for the Bradenton Expos, 
Montreal's rookie league affiliate in Florida, last spring. Gary, in the second 
year of a four-year, $1.8 million deal with the Rams, makes a fraction of that 
as a minor leaguer, but he doesn't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Last year with the Rams, he stalked the sidelines as a late-signing, 
first-round choice who carried only 37 times for 163 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"My intentions of playing baseball weren't because of Bo Jackson," Gary said. 
</P>
<P>
But doesn't Jackson's two-sport career open the doors for others? 
</P>
<P>
"In the public's eyes, it probably did," Gary said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because someone else was doing it. But if not, I would have done it 
anyway. Because I feel I have the physical attributes to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Gary, six feet and 225 pounds, said he hit .275 during Bradenton's extended 
spring season. But realistically, his road to the major leagues is lined with 
pot holes and curveballs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very, very raw baseball player," said Lorenzo Bundy, his manager at 
Bradenton. 
</P>
<P>
"He's strong and fast, but the big thing is he hasn't played a whole lot of 
baseball. Baseball is a very repetitious thing, we do same things, day in, day 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with Cleveland, he's here three weeks, then gone for mini-camp. 
He's here, then he's gone. His time is in great demand, so it's hard to 
dedicate himself to baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Bundy said Gary's throwing arm is only average and, like many young players, he 
has trouble with curveballs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a big, long swing," Bundy said, "which makes him susceptible to the 
breaking ball. 
</P>
<P>
"He's expressed an interest in getting to Jacksonville, our double-A team. But 
the higher the pitchers get, the more experience, and the more they'll know his 
weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
"He had some of the younger guys figuring him out, too." 
</P>
<P>
Gary said the Expos are looking for a six-month baseball commitment next 
spring, perhaps at Class-A West Palm Beach of the Florida State League. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it depends on Montreal," Gary said. "I do play football, and football 
is my sport, but I have to sign a new deal with Montreal. And I'm really not 
here to talk baseball. I'm really here to talk Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
A six-month commitment to the Expos starting in March would cut through the 
heart of a football season, as the Raiders know with Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for the Rams, Gary doesn't have million-dollar options in both sports, 
as does Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Gary had a poor rookie season because of a training camp 
holdout that lasted into September. 
</P>
<P>
Gary was effectively shelved for 1989. No wonder he couldn't wait for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very, very frustrating," Gary said of his first year with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
This year could be another story. Not only has Gary reported on time, but he 
seems very much in the Rams' future, despite another crowded backfield. The 
team traded last year's starter, Greg Bell, but signed veteran Curt Warner, 29, 
hoping to get at least one more great season out of him. 
</P>
<P>
How did Gary react to the signing of Warner? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a football player, I'm not a coach," he said. "I don't have control over 
any other thing other than going out and playing football and doing my job." 
</P>
<P>
But Warner's knees are tender, and he is not expected to carry the entire load. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm counting on an outstanding year from Curt Warner," Coach John Robinson 
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not counting on him getting 100%, or 90% of the carries. . . . I'm 
going to make sure Curt is healthy and full speed when he plays. I have great 
expectations for Cleveland Gary. I expect the tailback to be a shared position 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, in fact, almost apologized for leaving Gary on the sidelines too much 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the failure of his not playing was mine," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
So, Gary is left to fight it out with Warner and Gaston Green, now entering his 
third season. In terms of talent, Gary doesn't give up much to either player. 
</P>
<P>
So is Gary ready for 1990? Is a slider tough to hit? 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, when they drafted me, I didn't want to come in here and complain," 
Gary said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I love to get the ball. I don't put numbers on carries, I love to catch 
the football. But there's no doubt that Cleveland Gary is mature enough to 
handle the tailback position. There's no pressure. I just want that chance." 
</P>
<P>
Warner has the inside track for the starting job, but nothing has been 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not his job," running back coach Gil Haskell said. "It's nobody's job. 
Whoever does the best job plays." 
</P>
<P>
Gary, for one, can't wait to get started. If things don't work out, there's 
always spring training, 1991, to consider. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely will play Florida State League and hopefully double-A next year," 
Gary said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Florida State league, it's the highest A, the most competitive level. It's 
a pitcher's league. But I know I'm not supposed to be talking baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mark Herrmann signed a one-year contract and reported to camp with 
Jim Everett and other selected veterans. Herrmann's deal is worth $300,000, 
with a $10,000 roster bonus and other incentives. With Chuck Long recently 
signed, Herrmann's hopes of making the final cut seem to depend on the Rams 
keeping three quarterbacks, a decision that has not been made. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just coming out here to do the best job I can," Herrmann said. "It's not 
my decision. If I start putting pressure on myself, I won't perform as well, so 
we'll just have to see what happens." If the Rams go with two quarterbacks, 
Coach John Robinson said the decision between Long and Herrmann will be made on 
the field. "My goal isn't to be fair," he said. "My goal is to pick the best 
quarterback."

Kevin Mackey, basketball coach at Cleveland State, had cocaine in his system 
when he was arrested outside a suspected drug house, and his blood alcohol 
level was 0.2, well above the legal limit, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A urinalysis given to Mackey was designed to determine only whether the coach 
had drugs in his system and did not measure how much cocaine was present. 
Further charges could be filed against Mackey, who pleaded not guilty in 
Cleveland Municipal Court to drunken-driving charges stemming from the Friday

RESTAURANT OWNER FIGHTS POLLUTION FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest environmental fight in the Ojai Valley is over the question of 
whether a proposed spaghetti restaurant might add to local air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, who estimate that the restaurant could generate 600 
automobile trips a day, say the owner should pay $27,965 in air pollution fees 
for the privilege of building the restaurant in Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
But John Cuccia of Ojai, owner of Vince's Spaghetti House Inc., argues that the 
restaurant will generate much less traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia, who calls the recommended smog fee "ridiculous," is the first developer 
to run up against tightened air quality regulations for Ojai Valley that took 
effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 7,984-square-foot diner would lack large grills and broilers, 
architect LeRoy Andrews said. Nearly all the 7.68 pounds of smog-causing 
nitrogen oxides the restaurant would generate each day, according to county Air 
Pollution Control District's calculations, would come from customers' cars. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors adopted a five-pound-per-day limit last October 
on smog emissions from new development in the Ojai Valley. At the same time, 
the supervisors set a 25-pound-per-day threshold for projects built in the rest 
of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, any projects over the limit must contribute money to 
programs designed to reduce traffic in general, such as ride-sharing programs 
or mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
Developers throughout the county are watching battles such as Cuccia's to see 
how the dust settles in determining who has to pay for clean air. 
</P>
<P>
"These fees are really going to cut down on construction," Andrews said. "Any 
community without growth will stagnate." 
</P>
<P>
But more than that, the architect said he feels the new fees must be fairly 
applied. In the Oak View case, Andrews and Cuccia have contested air pollution 
officials all the way. 
</P>
<P>
Their restaurant's environmental review was set for a public hearing in April 
when a county review committee discovered that the impact study failed to cite 
the new air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews objected, saying the smog limits should not apply because the project's 
application was submitted last year. But a county legal opinion said the new 
limits do apply because the project's environmental review did not begin until 
after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In the revised study, released June 20, the Air Pollution Control District came 
up with Cuccia's fee based on an independent traffic consultant's estimate that 
the restaurant would generate 600 daily vehicle trips. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Report Review Committee is scheduled to continue the public 
hearing on that recommendation and others in the impact study Wednesday at 1:30 
p.m. in Room 344 of the Hall of Administration in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, Andrews and Cuccia submitted a new traffic study, the third they 
have commissioned for the project, which indicates the restaurant would 
generate less than 200 vehicle trips per day. 
</P>
<P>
County public works and air pollution officials said Monday that they are 
hurrying to evaluate the new traffic figures to see if a smog-impact fee is 
even needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still determining if it's a valid study," said Richard Guske of the 
Public Works Department. 'We probably won't have a report until Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said the first traffic studies did not take into account that the 
restaurant would be open only in the evenings. Its hours of operation are 
expected to be weekdays and Saturdays between 4 and 9 p.m. and from noon to 9 
p.m. on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this will be enough to let us go ahead," Andrews said.

PROBLEMS STILL PLAGUE GOMPERS, STUDY SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A HIGHLY-TOUTED PROGRAM TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AT THE RACIALLY TROUBLED 
SCHOOL HAS FAILED TO WORK, ACCORDING TO A REPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years after a much-ballyhooed renewal plan was begun for troubled Gompers 
Secondary School, the Southeast San Diego school still has severe student 
discipline problems, teacher turnover double the district average, a collapsing 
integration program and haphazard curriculum improvements, a school 
district-appointed committee of Gompers parents, teachers and community leaders 
has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The report from the longstanding committee, headed by retired Superior Court 
Judge Franklin B. Orfield, details the continuing turmoil over academic, 
leadership and integration issues at the award-winning math-science-computer 
magnet facility. 
</P>
<P>
Despite thousands of hours of staff meetings, community forums and Board of 
Education debates, there remain fundamental disagreements over how to maintain 
the high-powered curriculum -- intended to attract white students to the 
heavily non-white area -- and at the same time extend its benefits to the 
non-white neighborhood students long shut out of the special magnet offerings. 
</P>
<P>
But nowhere in the report are the leadership skills of principal Marie Thornton 
addressed directly, although Thornton has been a lightening rod both for praise 
and criticism during the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say she has been singled out for attack because she is black and 
supportive of neighborhood students. Critics say she lacks minimum skills to 
deal with teachers and parents, and they lay the turmoil at her door. 
</P>
<P>
The report, to be presented to board trustees today, said the renewal plan's 
"effectiveness to achieve an integrated, high performance technical magnet has 
not yet been demonstrated." 
</P>
<P>
Among the major findings of several subcommittees over the past year: 
</P>
<P>
* There is a critical need for improved student discipline. Now, students are 
defiant and do not respond to teacher pleas, and they fight, use profanity, and 
many are tardy and truant, especially at the junior-high level. 
</P>
<P>
* Communication is poor between students and teachers, students and counselors, 
teachers and counselors, and among parents, students and the principal's 
office. The school needs a weekend retreat where issues can be aired. 
</P>
<P>
* Achievement is still low for many students, many having less than a C 
average, along with unsatisfactory citizenship marks. Test scores are at or 
below district averages at the seventh- and eighth-grade levels -- with a 
majority of non-white students -- while much higher at the high-school level, 
in part a legacy of the fact that, until last year, grades nine-through-12 were 
small, all-magnet classes of equal numbers of white- and non-white students. 
</P>
<P>
* Teacher turnover averaged 47% the past two years, more than double the 
district average, with eight of 14 gone from the mathematics department, a key 
element in preparing neighborhood students for the rigors of the magnet. Seven 
chairmen of academic departments have left in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Although some community activists applaud the departure of those high-school 
teachers unwilling to bend to the dictates of the renewal plan -- and in 
particular the demand that they teach at the junior-high level -- the report 
said that, "if the plan is to be successfully implemented, this turnover rate 
must be lowered to create the stability needed for significant planning, 
increased morale and improved communications." 
</P>
<P>
The renewal plan was designed to expand the science-math magnet at the junior 
high level to include all neighborhood seventh- and eighth-graders, almost all 
of whom are black and Latino, by having magnet instructors at the high school 
level teach unior high as well. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Gompers magnet programs were restricted to an equal number of 
minority students matched on an equal basis with the white students who were 
bused to the school voluntarily, attracted by the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the junior high students had a different academic program that many 
parents and black community activists perceived as inferior. The high-school 
portion of Gompers had been a limited, all-magnet component of the school, and 
only about 40% of eighth-grade neighborhood students could remain at the school 
for their high school years. 
</P>
<P>
But, although neighborhood students can now stay at the school as long as they 
want, the report says that Gompers has "no clearly stated plan to bring 
under-skilled middle grades up to the standards of the high school magnet 
program." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the continued disagreements, non-resident white student 
enrollment has dropped 53% and the school is now 18.9% white, contrasted with 
33% during the 1985-86 school year. 
</P>
<P>
"The decrease in (white) students over the past two years occurred for every 
grade but the 10th grade," the report said. "There are now consistently 50 or 
fewer (white) students in every grade," making the district's integration goal 
-- the reason why the magnet was established -- impossible to carry out. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a waiting list of more than 1,300 students in 1985-86 has dwindled 
to about 100. "Recruitment of non-resident students must become a priority for 
this school," the report said, adding that a turnaround is not simple because 
"diverse factors are involved, including discipline, racial disharmony, 
miscommunications and staff turnover." 
</P>
<P>
One bright spot highlighted by the committee is the continuing strength of the 
gifted and talented education program (GATE) at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers in the program have apparently been able to insulate the program -- 
whose student composition is 50% white, 50% non-white -- from the general 
turmoil, the report said. A disproportionate number of the school's awards in 
past years have come from students in GATE classes. 
</P>
<P>
The committee offered no quick fixes in its report. Members do say, however, 
that the school's combined seventh-through-12th-grade structure may cause 
special difficulty for the principal and teachers because of distinct 
differences between junior high- and high-school-age students. 
</P>
<P>
Among recommendations are: 
</P>
<P>
* Some screening of students who want to attend Gompers, perhaps "something as 
simple as filling out an application." Now, any neighborhood student can attend 
Gompers automatically. "Students and their parents should understand their 
responsibilities and their commitments for participating in the magnet. An 
application process helps communicate the goals of the program and helps the 
student in the decision of whether or not to participate." 
</P>
<P>
* Screen new teachers coming to Gompers and help them acclimate to the school 
better. There have been no teachers in the district voluntarily coming to 
Gompers, and those new to the school have been assigned. There continues to be 
poor relations between many teachers and the administration. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report does not mention principal Thornton directly, schools Supt. 
Tom Payzant told Channel 10 commentator John Beatty last week that Thornton 
will remain at her post for the next school year. Payzant, who couldn't be 
reached for comment Monday, said on the television program that the school can 
improve if the media spotlight on it is dimmed.

SPLIT COUNCIL ARGUES OVER COURT ORDER; 
</P>
<P>
REMAPPING: MAYOR CALLS THE COUNCIL'S ACTION 'RIDICULOUS' AS IT DEBATES OVER A 
DECISION IT HAD BEEN ORDERED TO MAKE BY A FEDERAL COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Displaying its members' bitter divisions on redistricting, a fractious San 
Diego City Council on Monday accepted a court order delaying its decision until 
next week -- and, in the process, may have taken the first step back into court 
over the volatile topic. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's council vote and related actions underlined both the acrimony and 
absurdity that have come to surround the decennial effort to redraw the 
boundaries of the city's eight council districts -- a plan that has spent more 
time lately in federal courtrooms than City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Monday saw the council engage in a protracted, 80-minute debate before doing 
what a federal magistrate last week ordered it to do -- a discussion that, 
though seemingly innocuous, perhaps touched off a new round of legal 
maneuvering that could begin as soon as today. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever seen anything so ridiculous?" a flustered Mayor Maureen O'Connor 
asked after the hearing. "This is getting crazier as we go along." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's council hearing had been expected to be simply a brief, routine 
continuance of the redistricting debate until July 23, in accordance with the 
order issued last Thursday by U.S. Magistrate Harry McCue. 
</P>
<P>
In that order, McCue barred the council from proceeding this week, as planned, 
toward formal adoption of a redistricting plan that has drawn strong criticism 
from Latino activists, some community leaders and several council members since 
its tentative approval by the council last week. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond postponing council action, McCue's order also warns that, unless the 
council reverses itself and approves an alternative redistricting map developed 
by a citizens' advisory board, further court review of the plan is a certainty. 
Among other things, the plan passed last week dilutes the Latino composition of 
the proposed Latino-majority 8th District, and would dramatically alter the 
configuration of several other districts. 
</P>
<P>
Although McCue's order left the council with little to do other than to accept 
the week's delay, Monday's meeting was anything but brief and routine. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy debate -- punctuated by a few sharp exchanges between O'Connor and 
Councilman Bob Filner -- visibly frustrated some council members, whose chagrin 
was exacerbated by the fact that Monday's eventual unanimous decision was 
tantamount to doing nothing, as ordered by the court. 
</P>
<P>
"All we're doing is what the judge says we have to do," Councilman Ron Roberts 
said, shaking his head. "That shouldn't take nearly an hour and a half." 
</P>
<P>
From the perspective of attorneys for the Chicano Federation, the council's 
discussion should not have even occurred and perhaps violated McCue's order, 
which instructed the council to "not proceed in any way regarding the 
redistricting" until July 23. 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's meeting, the council debated, but rejected, the idea of holding 
a series of public hearings on the redistricting plan -- a proposal offered by 
Council members John Hartley and Linda Bernhardt, both of whom helped pass the 
controversial redistricting plan that Hartley offered last week. 
</P>
<P>
That discussion, Chicano Federation attorney Patricia Meyer argued, seemed to 
go beyond the scope of McCue's order, as well as raise more serious questions 
about the council's compliance with a settlement of the group's 1988 lawsuit 
challenging the constitutionality of the city's electoral system. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like they talked about a lot more than just a continuance," Meyer 
said. "I'm shocked that they're getting into areas that seem to clearly violate 
the settlement agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, the city agreed to establish a redistricting advisory 
board and to provide minority groups a meaningful voice in the development of 
the new proposed council boundaries. The council's rejection of the advisory 
board's plan last week in favor of Hartley's proposal -- only hours after the 
latter was publicized -- violated that agreement, the Chicano Federation 
argues. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the federation's attorneys contend that the proposed series of 
council hearings on redistricting would undermine the advisory board's purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"This call for new City Council-run hearings seems to usurp the advisory 
board's authority, and that goes to the heart of the settlement agreement," 
Meyer said, noting that the citizens' panel held 26 public hearings in 
preparing its proposed map. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like they're trying to come up with game plan No. 2 when game plan 
No. 1 didn't work," added Michael Aguirre, who filed the original suit and is 
Meyer's law partner. 
</P>
<P>
In response, some council members emphasize that, as its name suggests, the 
advisory board was simply that -- a panel that offered advice, not a mandate. 
</P>
<P>
"The name says it all," Councilman Wes Pratt said last week. "It's advisory 
only. I'm not going to delegate my legislative prerogative to an advisory 
committee or anyone else. It gave us something to start with, not something we 
had to accept." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Aguirre hinted that, in light of Monday's council action, the case 
could be back in U.S. District here before next Tuesday's scheduled status 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not print that we're not going to be taking any steps before then," 
Aguirre said late Monday. "We have some serious concerns about what the 
council's doing." 
</P>
<P>
In his order, McCue directed the council to reconsider both the advisory 
board's map and Hartley's plan next week. The timetable governing an 
ordinance's effective date, combined with the council's planned recess next 
month, means that, unless the council approves one of the plans next week, it 
could have difficulty meeting the Oct. 1 deadline specified in the settlement 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Though several council members asked city attorneys to approach the Chicano 
Federation and the federal judges involved in the case about a possible 
extension, Aguirre made it clear that one is not likely to be offered. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling that the five-vote bloc that passed last week's plan is on the verge of 
collapsing -- as evidenced by Hartley's remark that strong public sentiment 
could prompt him to oppose his own plan -- Aguirre hopes the relatively tight 
time frame could work in favor of the advisory board's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a finality, a deadline in these things," Aguirre said. "Right 
now, we feel like a team that's up a couple of points and would be content to 
let the clock run out."

MAKE A BID: DIRTY CARS AT BARGAIN PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Bud Fischer had seen it all, or so he thought, during his 41 years as a San 
Diego auctioneer. 
</P>
<P>
But this weekend in Chula Vista breaks all the records, because Fischer, with 
gavel in hand, will mount the podium and preside over the largest sale of 
confiscated vehicles ever held by the U.S. Marshal Service. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,300-car auction, which includes a Federal Drug Enforcement 
Administration-seized 1985 Porsche 930 Turbo and a mobile recording studio used 
to smuggle aliens, is expected to draw more than 1,500 people Friday through 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Normally a public auction is considered anything more than 200 vehicles, but 
numerous recent federal Immigration and Naturalization Service and U.S. Border 
Patrol seizures of cars carrying illegal aliens have swelled the marshal's car 
pounds. DEA- and FBI-seized vehicles are there, too. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Carson, a supervising deputy with the marshal's office in San Diego, 
said the vehicles sold this weekend should average about $1,000. The minimum 
bid will be $100, with winning bids on a dozen nicer vehicles subject to 
approval by the marshal's office. 
</P>
<P>
Most are autos and vans, a favored vehicle for smuggling aliens. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles are now spread out over several acres of asphalt and are covered 
with dirt and debris. Most have been left uncovered for three or more months, 
and some have been in the marshal's custody since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But, for an enterprising shopper not put off by the grime, the sale will offer 
many bargains. More than 150 used-car salesmen are expected. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the cars could fetch far higher prices in showrooms after a few dollars 
are spent cleaning them up, said Jeff Pembleton, a Fischer assistant and 
vehicle auction veteran. 
</P>
<P>
Car buyers "like to be coddled," he said. "They like to buy a pretty car in a 
pretty place." 
</P>
<P>
But those lured by claims that you can purchase "Miami Vice"-style exotic 
foreign cars for a few hundred dollars shouldn't bother making the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug runners and smugglers aren't going to smuggle in a Mercedes. They'll do 
it in a $300 car," Pembleton said. "For them, they're throwaway vehicles. 
Besides, it's not like you're going to pay $100 for a Porsche." 
</P>
<P>
Officials warn that it's common for con artists to attempt rip-offs at 
government car auctions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the scams Carson has seen include a phony $100 "credit card" that its 
advertisers say eliminates the $100 deposit required to bid. 
</P>
<P>
"They got taken," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, for the auctioneer, it's just another day on the block. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm used to it," Fischer said. "After a while, you learn how not to let it 
irritate your throat." 
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who says at top speed he can auction 80 cars an hour, guesses it will 
take him and his two assistants 20 hours of fast talking to get rid of the 
whole lot. 
</P>
<P>
Both Fischer and the marshal's office expect only 10% of the audience to be 
licensed dealers, leaving enthusiasts and less-practiced buyers an opportunity 
to compete. 
</P>
<P>
"They shouldn't be afraid of the used-car dealers," said Barry Borden, manager 
of Abre Enterprises of Chula Vista, which handled the vehicles for the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"The (dealers) won't be able to look at each car as well as the individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Though there won't be a lot of licensed dealers in the crowd, Pembleton said 
some unlicensed participants will buy several cars, only to resell them later. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys will come in here and buy five bottom-line $300 cars, get them 
started and turn around and sell them for $600 a piece," Pembleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Ney, supervisor of the DMV's bureau of investigations in Chula Vista, 
said there were 300 investigations in San Diego, Imperial and Riverside 
Counties in fiscal year 1989 involving unlicensed car sales, although he said 
public auctions don't exacerbate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly the car that should fetch the most this weekend is a pearl-white, 
heavily modified 1985 Porsche 930 Turbo. A European model, it was altered to 
meet U.S. standards before being imported. The exterior has also been heavily 
modified with a wrap-around spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
The car's 14-inch-wide Pirelli P7 tires alone -- at $1,200-a-set retail -- cost 
more than most than most cars on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mario Fallone, who sells Porsches at Hoehn Motors in Carlsbad, the 
car has a 3.3-liter, six-cylinder single-turbo capable of 330 horsepower that 
will shoot from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in 5.5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The marshal's office says the car has been appraised at more than $85,000, but 
Fallone said he couldn't see it go any higher than the $40,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
The Porsche will be kept roped off inside the auction warehouse, but the others 
will be unlocked for prospective buyers to look over, provided there is room to 
get the door open in the tightly packed lot. Members of the public can pop the 
hood, too, but they won't be able to start the engines. 
</P>
<P>
And don't think about stealing a loose item -- dipstick, hubcap, etc. -- that 
your car may be missing, as officials will keep a sharp eye on the vehicles, 
which remain the government's property until they're paid for. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective bidders can inspect the cars from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday and 
Friday and from 8 to 10 a.m. Friday through Sunday on the grounds, 3650 Main 
St., Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The auction will be in the warehouse beside the lots from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Friday, Saturday and as long as it takes on Sunday. Before receiving a bidder's 
number, participants must put down a $100 refundable deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Purchased cars must be paid for by 4 p.m. July 24 and cleared off the lot by 
the end of the day on July 27, which might be a tight deadline for some, 
considering that a few of the vehicles probably won't start. 
</P>
<P>
"Gas goes bad after a while," Borden said. "I don't think more than 80% of 
these cars will run." 
</P>
<P>
Cash or cashier's checks are the only payments accepted. 
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDY OF VENICE CANAL RESTORATION IS FUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has voted to spend $85,000 for a hydrology study 
of the Venice canals, the first step toward a long-awaited restoration of the 
decaying waterways. 
</P>
<P>
The five-month study will examine the quality of water in the canals and 
analyze ways to improve water flow, said Russ Ruffing, an environmental 
associate for the city Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
The study is expected to begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
"It will look at ways to improve the water flow so that the habitat for aquatic 
creatures is improved," said Chris Kroll, a staff analyst for the state Coastal 
Conservancy, which last March agreed to contribute $66,000 toward the study. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the study is needed before the city can move forward on various 
proposals to restore the canals, which will involve rehabilitating 
disintegrating banks.

GRAND JURY INQUIRY OF KOLENDER REPORTED; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: A VARIETY OF ALLEGATIONS, RANGING FROM SEX WITH PROSTITUTES TO 
FAVORITISM FOR CHARGERS PLAYERS, WERE THE FOCUS OF A PROBE, WHICH IS 
CONTINUING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Union has reported that one of the newspaper's top executives -- 
former Police Chief Bill Kolender -- was at the center of a grand jury probe of 
misconduct and favoritism in the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury investigated a variety of allegations, ranging from whether 
Kolender had sex with prostitutes to the department giving San Diego Chargers 
players preferential treatment, the Union reported in stories Sunday and 
Monday. In addition, several jurors believed Kolender lied when testifying 
before the panel and wanted him indicted for perjury, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury did not recommend criminal charges following its probe, and no 
indictments have been filed in connection with those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury, which disbanded June 30, ran out of time before it could finish 
its investigations, foreman J. Phil Franklin has said. Franklin, who could not 
be reached Monday for comment, also has said that several areas of inquiry were 
referred for further review to a new grand jury, which began operations July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The foreman of the 1990-91 grand jury, Reno J. Testolin, said Monday that he 
could not discuss what the new panel is investigating and declined to comment 
on the Union stories. "I don't know what we'll be looking into now," he said. 
"But we'll look into all aspects of it." 
</P>
<P>
Grand juries operate in secret, and the violation of that secrecy can lead to 
criminal penalties. Brian Michaels, the chief deputy district attorney 
directing the grand jury probe, said in a statement released Monday that 
prosecutors intend to "determine both the criminal liability and the motivation 
of the person or persons who did the leaking" to the Union. 
</P>
<P>
Kolender, assistant to the publisher of the Union-Tribune Publishing Co., did 
not return phone calls to his office Monday. He has been with the company since 
he left the Police Department in 1988, after 13 years as chief. 
</P>
<P>
In Kolender's final years as chief, the department suffered a number of 
setbacks. Among them was a ticket-fixing scandal that led to a reprimand for 
Kolender by City Manager John Lockwood. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Union, which cited unnamed sources, the grand jury probe 
expanded from an investigation into the way police officers handled a client 
list kept by convicted madam Karen Wilkening and Kolender's alleged association 
with her. 
</P>
<P>
The list -- a Rolodex file kept by Wilkening, who ran a high-class call-girl 
ring -- was found in a 1987 police raid of Wilkening's apartment. It contained 
the names of prominent people and at least one police officer, the grand jury 
said in its final report, issued June 27. 
</P>
<P>
In that report, the grand jury also said that the list may have been tampered 
with while in police custody. The report was critical of department procedures 
in cases of possible "corrupt or criminal" police conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The dissatisfaction of a number of jurors with how the jury handled those 
topics led to disclosure of grand jury activities to the Union, the paper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Four witnesses -- including two former Wilkening employees -- told the panel 
that Kolender had an association with Wilkening and her call girls, the Union 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Both former prostitutes said they met Kolender at a downtown hotel, a meeting 
attended by Wilkening -- though the paper put the date at 1984 in Sunday's 
story and 1985 in Monday's. One of the prostitutes told the jury she had sex 
with Kolender in a private hotel suite on at least two occasions, the paper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kolender told the Union that was "absolute baloney" and added that he had never 
met Wilkening, who is serving a 44-month prison sentence. Wilkening also denied 
ever meeting Kolender, the Union said. 
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that some jurors questioned Kolender's credibility, in part 
because they found it hard to believe that Wilkening's call-girl ring, which 
existed for six years, could have been run without police knowledge. In 
contrast, the Union added, jurors found the two former call girls to be 
credible witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury also heard testimony about preferential treatment for certain 
Mission Bay bars, the Union said. Citations issued for selling alcohol to 
minors were canceled by police officials, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the panel was told that several Chargers players openly used 
cocaine and other drugs but police took no action, the Union said. Further, 
police failed to pursue prosecution of players' traffic violations, the paper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also was told that former Charger quarterback Dan Fouts was shot in 
the shoulder in 1983, the Union said. Ex-fullback Chuck Muncie testified that 
he and Fouts were in a Del Mar condo with two women when either the boyfriend 
or the spouse of the woman accompanying Fouts arrived and shot Fouts, wounding 
him slightly in the shoulder, the Union reported. 
</P>
<P>
George Varela and Dick Lewis, two police officers who were attached to 
Kolender's office and also worked as security guards for the football team, 
hushed up the shooting and no police reports were ever made, the paper said. 
Both have since left the department to work for the team, the Union said, but 
neither could be reached Monday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Muncie was sentenced in 1989 to 2 1/2 years in prison after pleading guilty to 
a federal drug charge and to lying to a federal judge about using cocaine while 
free on bail. He told a KNSD (Channel 39) television reporter Monday, "I did 
not see Fouts get shot. I only told the grand jury about the rumors in the 
locker room." 
</P>
<P>
Fouts, now a network sportscaster, said Monday, "I have never been shot at. I 
have never been shot. I have never been treated for a gunshot wound. I couldn't 
make any more strong of an absolute, unequivocal and firm denial."

SUSPECT HELD IN HOLDUP OF CABBIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLAKE FONTENAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police have arrested a man who they believe attacked and robbed a cabdriver 
Friday night, but the person who killed another cabdriver Saturday night is 
still at large, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested Lester McGibbon, 33, of Plattsburg, N.Y., in 
connection with the armed robbery of a Yellow Cab Co. driver Saturday morning, 
San Diego Police Department spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police found McGibbon lying injured near a Yellow Cab at the intersection of 
Brannick Avenue and Hammel Street in Los Angeles about 9:30 a.m. Saturday, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
McGibbon told police that he had been beaten and robbed by several people 
carrying clubs and sticks, and he was taken to a local hospital, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor there said that his femur was fractured because he had been shot in 
the leg," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
In the incident Friday night, driver William Joseph Tufford struggled with a 
gun-wielding attacker before the man stole his cab and escaped. McGibbon may 
have shot himself during that struggle, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
A license plate check on the cab found in Los Angeles showed that it had been 
stolen from San Diego, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are still looking for a suspect in the murder of Leonard Brumlow, 
another Yellow Cab driver who was shot and killed Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
McGibbon was in police custody at the time of Brumlow's death, Robinson said.

RESIDENTS REDUCE USE OF WATER 11% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN KUSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Camarillo residents cut water consumption by 11% during May and June, but 
overall water use rose 5% in the 1989 fiscal year that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Residents began to use less water after the City Council adopted a conservation 
ordinance in April that makes it illegal to hose down sidewalks or wash 
automobiles with hoses that do not contain automatic shut-off valves. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also prohibits lawn watering between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
During May and June, the Camarillo Water Department pumped 489 million gallons 
of water, compared to 538 million gallons during the same time last year, 
producing a savings of 49 million gallons, Elwell said. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows that people are very aware of the water shortage and have begun to 
reduce wasteful practices," said John Elwell, city director of community 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Since the ordinance was adopted, the city has issued 282 citations. Of those, 
four were to second-time offenders, who were fined 50% of their most recent 
water bills, Elwell said. The remaining 278 citations were warning notices. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage people to save even more water, the council has decided to bill 
customers monthly and introduce a tiered pricing system. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Oct. 1, customers who reduce water use by 10% will notice no change in 
their monthly rate, said Anita Bingham, city finance director. Those who use 
more than the average 11,968 gallons a month will pay more depending on how 
much water they use, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The average water bill, which is sent every two months, is $34.40, Elwell said.

VICTIMS' PROGRAM APPLIES FOR $165,000 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The county's Victim/Witness Assistance program is applying for $165,000 in 
state funds to continue the program for its 11th year. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors is expected to approve the application at today's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the $310,389 needed to operate the program in fiscal year 
1990-91 is expected to come from the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The Victim/Witness Program provides assistance to anyone who suffered a 
personal, violent crime," said Kathleen McGoldrick, director of the program. 
Services include counseling, crisis intervention and aid in obtaining court 
help such as temporary restraining orders. 
</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 new county crime victims and their families used the program's 
services last year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every victim who comes through here has had his or her life devastated in some 
way by crime," McGoldrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the program's money comes from criminals in the form of penalty 
assessments. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of this month, the state added an extra $2.4 million for the more

Six county programs are applying for a new statewide award designed to honor 
innovative and useful community projects. 
</P>
<P>
The programs, whose applications are expected to be approved by the Board of 
Supervisors today, will be competing for the new Challenge Awards, sponsored by 
the County Supervisors Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
All California counties can submit up to six applications for the contest. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County departments applying are: 
</P>
<P>
* General Services Agency for its work in the transformation of the Ojai Valley 
Trail, a 9.5-mile abandoned railroad track that was converted into a 
recreational trail for hiking and horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
* The chief administrative office for the Child Care Services program, which 
provides low-cost, trained care for children of county employees and assists 
with coordinating similar programs for private agencies. 
</P>
<P>
* The County Recorder for the Videotape Program. The public can view a 
videotape at the county clerk's office to find out how to obtain copies of 
vital records, such as birth and death certificates and marriage licenses. 
</P>
<P>
* The Solid Waste and Management Department for its work in implementing the 
Government Center Recycling Program. Most types of paper waste at the center 
are being collected for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
* Superior and Municipal Courts for the Court Administration Consolidation 
project. The administrative services for the two courts were consolidated, 
resulting in more efficient use of staff and in standardized procedures. 
</P>
<P>
* The district attorney's consumer mediation section for providing consumers 
and businesses with information regarding their legal rights and 
responsibilities to help resolve disputes before they go to litigation.

METHANOL-GAS CARS MAY BE PURCHASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County is scheduled to decide today whether to buy up to three new cars 
that run on methanol as well as on gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
If the Board of Supervisors approves the purchases, the cars will be assigned 
to departments that need to replace vehicles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal from the county General Services Department, no car could 
cost more than 15% above the price of a conventional car. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, the county has used eight Ford Escorts that run on methanol. The 
cars' emissions are cleaner, but they get only about half the mileage of 
conventional automobiles, said Tom Womack, chief deputy director of the general 
services agency. 
</P>
<P>
Also, since few service stations carry methanol, Womack said, the cars have 
been limited to a 150-mile radius so that drivers will not be stranded. 
</P>
<P>
"The second-generation cars have the advantage of being able to run on either 
type of fuel depending on the situation," Womack said. 
</P>
<P>
"The technology for alternate-fuel vehicles continues to get better and 
better," he said, and the county will probably continue to experiment with 
different types of cars. MAYA RADEVICH

OVER 60 ANIMALS SEIZED AT ILLEGAL WILDLIFE COMPOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirteen bobcats and more than 50 other animals were seized from an Acton 
residence Monday where authorities said a woman had been operating an 
unlicensed wild animal compound and dog kennel for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County animal control officers confiscated the animals from Susan 
Jennifer Arn, 44, who kept the animals in cages on her rural property in the 
35000 block of Acton Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Arn was arrested on suspicion of operating an unlicensed wild animal compound, 
a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail or a fine of up to $1,000. 
She was being held at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar for psychiatric 
observation after becoming emotionally upset during her arrest, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 bobcats and two chousts -- a cross breed of bobcat and domestic cat -- 
were taken to the Wildlife Waystation, a private animal preserve in Little 
Tujunga Canyon. The rest of the animals, including 40 golden retrievers, 10 
cats and five kittens, were being held at the Los Angeles County Animal Care 
and Control shelter in Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
Three snakes, including two five-foot-long boa constrictors, that were seized 
from Arn also were being kept at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Animal control officers along with California Department of Fish and Game 
wardens and sheriff's deputies raided the property and seized the animals 
because Arn had refused repeated orders to get proper permits to breed and sell 
dogs and shelter other animals. 
</P>
<P>
"She was in business without any permits at all," said John Rozier, a 
supervisor at the Animal Control office. "This had been going on for at least 
two years. We tried to work with her and she just never complied. It got to the 
point that we had to do something." 
</P>
<P>
Rozier said Arn advertised in local newspapers to sell the animals and 
apparently took in stray animals, such as the bobcats, that were brought to 
her. Though there are other houses in Acton Canyon, most are on 2 1/2- to 
20-acre properties and none are close to Arn's home. 
</P>
<P>
Rozier said the animals were well cared for, but there was no fence around 
Arn's property -- a safety measure that is a requirement for permits. 
</P>
<P>
"The animals were in cages, but if they got out there was no fence to keep them 
on the property," Rosier said. "In that situation, the bobcats could be 
dangerous. If they got hungry enough, they would be dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Game Warden Jan Yost said it is illegal in California to own a bobcat 
without a Fish and Game Commission permit. She said that such permits are 
rarely issued because the bobcat is a species of native California wildlife.

A young boy and his father were recovering in local hospitals Monday night 
after being shot by an unknown motorcyclist in Clairemont, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Roger Goddu, 39, and his son, Jason, 10, were shot as they rode a 
motorcycle near the Clairemont branch of the post office around 2:10 p.m. 
Monday, said Bill Robinson, a Police Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The attacker, who was also riding a motorcycle, is still at large, Robinson 
said, adding that the elder Goddu indicated to officers that the shooting might 
be related to another shooting on July 11 that he said he had witnessed. That 
shooting, in which no one was hurt, resulted in the arrest of two suspects, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Goddu was in intensive care in fair condition at Children's Hospital with 
wounds to his chest and arm, according to his father, who had been treated 
earlier in the day at Sharp Memorial Hospital for an arm wound. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his son's bedside late Monday, Alan Goddu said that, despite the 
threats, he was determined that the assailant be punished.

EXCEPT FOR ONE SMALL DETAIL, BRIDGE DEDICATION IS RED-LETTER OCCASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Had Charlotte Grossman seen it, those who knew her said, she would have 
chuckled at the blunder made Monday morning by city officials in Northridge as 
they tried to honor her memory. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson stood on a recently completed bridge designed to ease 
traffic on Nordhoff Street. He dedicated the structure to the late Grossman, a 
Northridge merchant, but as he spoke, a few of the 60 people listening 
whispered that something was wrong. They pointed to a gold-colored plaque, 
mounted on a cement guardrail, which misspelled her first name: "Charlette 
Grossman Memorial Bridge." 
</P>
<P>
"She's giggling up there somewhere," Norman Grossman said of his late wife, who 
often laughed at herself for making mistakes when telling jokes. " 'Goofed 
again,' she's thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Opened to traffic June 12, the bridge spans Southern Pacific railroad tracks 
and Limekiln Creek. The bridge is part of a $4-million connector road, nearly a 
half-mile long, that links two unaligned portions of Nordhoff Street, which had 
intersected Corbin Avenue from the east a quarter-mile north of where it 
crossed Corbin from the west. 
</P>
<P>
The city has wanted to build the connector since 1972, but the project was not 
funded until 1986, when the Yarmouth Group, which owns the Northridge Fashion 
Center, agreed to pay $1.5 million of the cost in exchange for city permission 
to expand the mall. The payment qualified the project for federal matching 
funds needed to build the road, Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Grossman, who died in 1988, and her husband were among the first 
merchants to move into the Northridge Fashion Center when the mall opened in 
1971. Bernson, who at one time owned a T-shirt shop next to the Grossmans' 
luggage store, said he wanted the bridge named for her because of its 
relationship to the mall and because construction began about the time of her 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Grossman died seven years after she and her husband closed their 
store. When the Yarmouth Group bought the shopping center in 1981, the firm 
decided the Grossmans' business was making too little money to justify its 
prime location in the mall, said Paul Wilson, a company senior vice president. 
The Grossmans refused the firm's offer of a less desirable spot in the shopping 
center, Wilson said, and the company decided not to renew the couple's lease. 
Wilson agreed that it was strange that the bridge his firm partly funded was 
dedicated to a merchant his company forced out of the mall. "I guess there 
could be some irony in there somewhere," Wilson said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
Of the misspelling of her name, Bernson said, "We'll fix it."

OXNARD TOLD TO PAY $1.95 MILLION TO CONSTRUCTION FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A JUDGE UPHELD AN EARLIER RULING THAT THE CITY VIOLATED A CONTRACT WITH 
THE COMPANY HIRED TO BUILD A STORM DRAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge has upheld an earlier ruling that requires the city of 
Oxnard to pay a local construction firm $1.95 million for violating a contract 
with the company. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer representing the city had asked Los Angeles County Superior Court 
Judge Ronald M. Sohigian to dismiss an arbitration ruling that said Oxnard 
breached a contract with B &amp; Sons Construction Inc. of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
But Sohigian ruled on Friday that the decision made in arbitration in May by 
retired Superior Court Judge Thomas T. Johnson was "supported by substantial 
evidence and was not based on an error of law." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig said the City Council will consider the judge's 
ruling today and decide whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Holmberg, an attorney representing the city of Oxnard in the contract 
dispute, said he asked the judge to dismiss the arbitration ruling because he 
believes the city should not have to pay nearly $1.2 million in anticipated 
profits lost by B &amp; Sons due to damage to the company's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
B &amp; Sons lawyers had argued successfully that the canceled contract damaged 
the company's ability to become bonded by insurance companies against failure 
to complete government jobs. Government contracts once made up 65% of the 
company's business. 
</P>
<P>
Lanny McKay, contract administrator for the company, on Monday criticized 
Oxnard officials for trying to renege on the arbitration decision to compensate 
the company for canceling the contract. He accused the city of spending 
taxpayers' money to delay paying what it owes the company. 
</P>
<P>
Holmberg disagreed, saying the city has a right to oppose the arbitration 
decision if it believes the ruling was unfair. The court hearing and the 
arbitration were held in Los Angeles because attorneys representing both sides 
of the case work in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute began in 1988 when the city offered B &amp; Sons $4.8 million to 
build almost three miles of storm drain for water runoff in the 1,600-acre 
Northeast Industrial Assessment District in northeast Oxnard. Before the 
project could begin, the company discovered that the ground water and soil were 
contaminated by petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
The company began working at the site while the city investigated how much it 
would cost to clean up the contamination. About six months later, the city 
determined that it would have to spend up to $12 million to remove the 
contaminants and build a storm drain there. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, when B &amp; Sons refused to work on the contaminated 
section without high-cost safety provisions, the city fired the company. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the city hired another company to complete the project and build the 
drain in another section of the district. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson ruled during arbitration hearings that the city was liable for damages 
because it knew that the area where the drain was to be built was contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said that if the money is paid, the cost will be borne by 
property owners in the district, where business and industrial parks are to be 
built. The city administers the assessment district.

<P>
A 22-year-old San Diego man was sentenced Monday to three years in state prison 
for committing a racially motivated beating of a Pacific Islander man he 
mistook for being Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
Michael DiPaolo is the last of three defendants to be sentenced for the Oct. 
21, 1989, beating of Eric Vaerga, 18, in Mission Beach. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge William Mudd also imposed a $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
DiPaolo's attorney, Gary Bloch, said DiPaolo had disassociated himself from the 
skinhead movement and urged that his client be placed on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Sentenced by Mudd to a longer term on March 28 was co- defendant, Michael Mann, 
21, who received a six-year prison sentence. Mann also had a previous 
conviction for beating a Vietnamese person because of his race. 
</P>
<P>
Another co-defendant, Steven Kuntz, 20, of San Diego, is serving a one-year 
jail term. 
</P>
<P>
Vaerga suffered a concussion, a fractured jaw, facial cuts and bruises, and 
dislocated ankle from being hit and kicked by the defendant's steel-toed boots. 
White supremacy comments were yelled by the defendants during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
DiPaolo pleaded guilty to felony assault and a civil rights violation on Feb. 
13. His prior criminal history included a robbery charge in which the victim 
was struck with a flashlight and had his wallet taken in January, 1989.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PACOIMA MAN ARRESTED AFTER 44-MINUTE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacoima man who authorities thought was driving a stolen truck led police on 
a 44-minute chase around the East Valley into Hollywood and back to the Valley 
before he lost control of the vehicle crashed into a wall in a parking lot in 
Pacoima, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Veloz, who owns the truck he was driving, was arrested on suspicion of 
evading arrest after the Monday afternoon chase, which began when officers 
signaled him to pull over, said Sgt. Sol Pollen. 
</P>
<P>
Veloz was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Pollen said that Veloz probably did not want to stop because they believe he 
was using cocaine. A cocaine pipe was found in the car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Veloz eluded police on the surface streets of Pacoima driving at speeds between 
45 m.p.h. to 55 m.p.h. Then he entered the Hollywood Freeway and drove toward 
Sylmar at speeds up to 85 m.p.h. before exiting, re-entering and driving to the 
Hollywood Bowl. Finally, he returned by freeway to Pacoima, where he crashed, 
Pollen said.

PETER J. VOLCHEFF; RETIRED AIRLINE PILOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter J. Volcheff, a longtime commercial airline pilot, has died at his Sherman 
Oaks home. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
Volcheff began flying a DC-3 for American Airlines in 1942 and retired in 1981 
while flying a 747 for the same airline. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged two trips a week across the United States. 
</P>

A longtime San Fernando Valley resident, he died Friday of complications of 
lupus, said his wife, Helen Jo Volcheff. 
</P>
<P>
Born Sept. 12, 1921, in Cleveland, Volcheff took up flying when he was in high 
school, although his mother wanted him to be a violinist. 
</P>
<P>
He served as an airplane mechanic and flight instructor for the U.S. Army 
during and after World War II. After his discharge, he returned to American 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 41 years; brothers Gus Volcheff of Glendale and 
Nick Volcheff of Scottsdale, Ariz.; four nieces and four nephews. A Mass will 
be celebrated at 10 a.m. today at St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church, 
13370 Valleyheart Drive in Sherman Oaks. Burial will follow at San Fernando 
Mission Cemetery. J.T. Oswald Mortuary in North Hollywood is handling the 
arrangements.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 1 DIES, 1 HURT IN CRASH OF STOLEN MOTORCYCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The driver of a stolen motorcycle was killed and his passenger seriously 
injured when he hit a curb while going an estimated 90 m.p.h. and crashed in 
Mission Hills, Los Angeles police reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Bruce Heschong said investigators were unsure of the driver's name because 
he had no identification. 
</P>
<P>
He was believed to be about 17 or 18 years old. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old youth from Mission Hills, whose identity was not released, was a 
passenger when the motorcycle crashed at 11:25 p.m. Sunday at a dead end on 
Columbus Avenue south of Los Alimos Street. He was in serious condition at Holy 
Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Heschong said the motorcycle's owner, who lives in Sylmar, had reported it 
stolen. He said the two teen-agers were riding it up and down the block of 
Columbus Avenue that dead-ends against the Simi Valley Freeway. The pair 
stopped occasionally to drink beer with people who were watching, police said. 
</P>
<P>
On the last trip down the street, the motorcycle reached a speed of about 90 
m.p.h. and the driver could not stop before striking the curb at the dead end, 
Heschong said. Both teen-agers were thrown to the ground.

stainless-steel kettles, sliced circles of onions topped a steaming meat sauce 
made from a family recipe. 
</P>
<P>
Next to another 100-gallon kettle, Jeffrey's father, Richard, 55, stirred a 
long spatula in a stewing batch of Oregon red raspberries. 
</P>
<P>
Two women spooned nine-ounce portions of mango chutney, taken from barrels 
shipped from Bombay, India, into jars. A vinegary smell wafted from tubs of 
green olives, imported from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Among the large lots and big houses on East Highland Avenue in this small town 
hard against the San Gabriel foothills, Waldo Ward &amp; Son, in a rambling 
warehouse beside a Victorian house and a red barn, is hardly noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
For 99 years, the Wards have been canning and preserving oranges, kumquats and 
other fruits and condiments. Much of the produce is grown on Ward land in the 
San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Today, three generations of Ward men operate the business from the three-acre 
plot where the homestead and barn were built in 1903. The recipes are 
time-tested, many of them gathered by the founder, the late E. Waldo Ward Sr., 
who took lengthy trips selling gourmet food around the West in the early part 
of this century. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't give a damn about volume," said Jeffrey's grandfather, 87-year-old E. 
Waldo Ward Jr. "We give a damn about quality product." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey said: "We have a niche, selling to people who want better quality. 
That's where we come in, like a Rolls-Royce." 
</P>
<P>
Waldo, Richard and Jeffrey: Each proudly speaks of following in his father's 
footsteps and of being firmly planted in Sierra Madre. The three bachelors 
(Waldo's wife died in 1971, and Richard was divorced 10 years ago) live 
together in the Victorian house. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't another place like it in Sierra Madre where you have the same 
family living on a place for four generations," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Waldo, a Pomona College chemistry major in the 1920s, why he never left 
Sierra Madre, and he will look at you as if you're crazy to suggest he might 
have. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Richard, who graduated from UC Davis with a degree in agricultural 
economics in 1957, and he acknowledges that he wasn't sure that he would uphold 
tradition. In fact, he worked six years for Del Monte Foods Inc. in the Bay 
Area. But he said he found that "when you work for a large company, you just 
feel like you're a smaller cog in the works." 
</P>
<P>
Ask Jeffrey, Richard's only son (his two daughters aren't affiliated with the 
business), and he says he wanted to work in the family firm since he was 12. He 
majored in food science and technology at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
In an office cluttered with everything from the mounted skin of a diamondback 
rattlesnake killed in the groves to black-and-white photographs of himself as a 
boy, Waldo Jr. held forth on his marmalade birthright. 
</P>
<P>
Waldo Sr., he said, developed tuberculosis when he worked for a New York fancy 
foods company and in 1887 headed west for drier air. He eventually settled in 
Sierra Madre, then a mecca for tuberculosis patients. 
</P>
<P>
He bought 10 acres for a house and orange groves, developed his own thriving 
marmalade line and shipped oranges back East by the crate. He even imported to 
Sierra Madre two trees from Seville, Spain, known for its tart oranges. 
</P>
<P>
Ward obtained many recipes when, as a traveling salesman, he met women recently 
arrived from Great Britain, where they had worked in preserves factories. Now 
typed on 3-by-5 cards, the recipes still are used in the business, which 
employs two dozen workers during peak periods. 
</P>
<P>
As business expanded and railway companies, for example, bought his 
British-style marmalade, he acquired more land. Ward's preserves graced 
breakfast tables in Southern Pacific and Santa Fe dining cars and in railroad 
hotels at depots across the West. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Wards have sold groves to be subdivided, but they say they 
have no plans to sell out. Waldo Ward pointed to a computer and a fax machine 
-- recent additions, thanks to his grandson, who wants to expand their 
mail-order business. Just last year, the firm began accepting credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Ward has filled orders for many California establishments, including Knott's 
Berry Farm, Jurgensen's Groceries and Pea Soup Andersen's Restaurants. "In the 
'20s," he said, "we used to sell to all the good stores in Boston and New York 
City." 
</P>
<P>
Outside, Richard Ward surveyed the palms, the fruit-heavy orange trees and the 
San Gabriel foothills to the north. He passed under a tin-roofed shed where the 
morning sun cured walnuts. As he headed in to finish a batch of red raspberry 
preserves, he said: "You get spoiled living here."

WHITNEY'S PHILOSOPHY IS SOLID GOLD

Tisha Whitney has a philosophy on cycling which helped her take home a second 
gold medal at the Great Earth National Masters Cycling Championships Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to decide to like everything; wind, flat surface, hills," Whitney 
said. "The people that don't, it throws them off when they race." 
</P>
<P>
Whitney, who lives in Irvine but races for the San Diego based Cyclo-Vets won 
the women's 40-45 time trials in 1:02.30. Lynn Turks of Deerfield Beach, Fla. 
placed second (1:05.03), Sally DeSonia of Salt Lake City was third (1:05.18), 
Susan Rubin of Bakersfield was fourth (1:05.42) and Narda Roushdi of Berkeley 
was fifth with a time of 1:06.06. Whitney had won the women's 40-45 criterium. 
</P>
<P>
In the time trials, a 40-kilometer (25 mile course) spanning from the Tijuana 
toll road to the Rosarito exit and back, riders are released every minute and 
race against the clock rather than each other. In time trials Whitney used 
riders in front of her to gage how she is doing and to get her mind off the 
physical pain or fatigue she might be feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"You constantly ask yourself, 'can I go harder?,' " Whitney said. "You have a 
second person in your mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad my name's Whitney so I was next to last to go. Being near the end you 
can chase them (riders ahead) being able to compute how you're doing. You see a 
little dot ahead of you and instead of feeling pain you keep assessing, 'am I 
gaining or is she going ahead?' It takes your mind off of what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
One of Whitney's goals going into Nationals was to defend her title in both 
events and collect her third and fourth national jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you've won the pressure's on to hold onto the jersey," Whitney said. "Now 
the pressure's kind of off." 
</P>
<P>
Whitney will be competing in two track events which will be held at the 
Velodrome in Balboa Park Wednesday through Friday and the road race (48 
kilometers) Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney hadn't raced since injuring her wrist and arm six weeks ago and said 
her wrist was sore after racing both Sunday and Monday. While competing in a 
road race in Mammoth, Whitney felt the aftermath of a collision which sent her 
flying off her bike, not only injuring her right wrist and arm but causing 
$2,000 damage to her bike. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out of it well considering my bike," Whitney said. "It was probably 
good I got thrown off or I would have been fallen on." 
</P>
<P>
The crash merely delayed but didn't stop Whitney from finishing the race. One 
of the girls was taken to the hospital to be treated for a broken pelvis, so 
Whitney asked if she could use the girl's bike. Soon, Whitney was back riding 
and finished the race. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't realize how much you use your hands in racing until something like 
this happens," Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
Tisha and her husband John, also a rider for Cyclo-Vets and a competitor in the 
men's 45-49 division, joined Cyclo-Vets in 1988 after meeting member and former 
national champion Genna Mayberry at the nationals in Florida. Tisha said 
Mayberry's friendliness and dedication inspired her to join, although it 
required traveling to San Diego to train. The Whitneys come down "as often as 
they can" but Tisha said she's been traveling to San Diego a little more often 
to train with her coach, Dr. Arnie Baker, in preparation for the Velodrome 
because there isn't one near her. 
</P>
<P>
During this week of Nationals in San Diego the Whitneys are staying with 
teammate Marty Rose who placed second in the women's 45-49 time trials. Rose 
was clocked in 1.04:51, behind national champion Camilla Buchanan of 
Williamsburg, Va. whose time was 1.03:47. Rose's teammate Barbara Rasmussen, 
also of San Diego, rode the course in 1.05:59, placing third and Elaine 
Steinway from Fallbrook, who rides for Celo Pacific, placed fourth with a time 
of 1:06.14. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Giesbach of Fullerton, who won the women's 30-34 division, came to San 
Diego for the time trails in between a 17-day stage race in Idaho and the 
senior nationals in Albany, N.Y. next week. Giesbach, whose forte is time 
trials, was clocked in 57:21 ahead of second place finisher Janice Gaines of 
Portland, Ore. (57:52), Liz Heller of St. Louis (57:57), Sue Sutton of San 
Diego (59:23) and Maureen Chambers of Chapel Hill, N.C. (1:00.38).

The Michigan Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of a special education 
student who was barred from playing basketball by the Michigan High School 
Athletic Assn. because he was too old. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's parents and Cardinal Mooney High School in Mount Clemens, Mich., had 
asked the organization for dispensation from the rule that kept John McClellan 
from playing with the basketball team once he turned 19 during the 1986-87 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
McClellan had been allowed to practice and play with the team in the last few 
minutes of games since transferring from an institution for students with 
emotional and learning disabilities in the 1985-86 term.

LUMINA HOPES TO HITCH A RIDE WITH TOM CRUISE; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: MANY ARE SKEPTICAL, HOWEVER, THAT THE CHEVROLET'S SUPPORTING ROLE IN 
THE "DAYS OF THUNDER" MOVIE WILL BRING BUYERS TO SHOWROOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When mom, dad and the kids drive to the neighborhood theater to see "Days of 
Thunder" this summer, they may be surprised to discover that the family car has 
a starring role. 
</P>
<P>
The Chevrolet Lumina, the transportation of choice for many people whose 
favorite option is a child safety seat, turns up as Tom Cruise's howling 
monster of a race car in the film, complete with stickers on its neon-green 
body armor promoting auto parts, not theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
This may strike some as an odd way to promote a car that was introduced as a 
competitor for the conservative Ford Taurus last year. But Chevrolet hopes the 
entire Lumina line -- which includes a sedan, a coupe and a van -- will benefit 
from the "Days of Thunder" connection. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrolet dealerships are bedecked in "Days of Thunder" banners, and shoppers 
are being offered special incentives on the sportiest version of the Lumina, 
the Euro model. The $50-million promotional effort by the auto maker and other 
sponsors even includes a shopping mall tour featuring a replica of Cruise's 
car. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are looking for is lots of exposure for the Lumina," said Chevrolet 
spokesman Dan Hubbert. "This is another way of generating some excitement for 
the product." 
</P>
<P>
Hubbert said it's too early to tell whether the campaign will power Lumina into 
the winner's circle. Other cars have benefited from favorable film and 
television exposure, including the Pontiac Trans Am in "Knight Rider," the 
Pontiac Firebird in "Smokey and the Bandit" and the Ford Mustang in "Bullitt." 
But dealers said "Days of Thunder," released June 27 and doing less business 
than expected, has had little impact on Lumina sales so far. 
</P>
<P>
At Kramer Chevrolet in Santa Monica, Claud Ellard is still waiting for the race 
to begin. "In our particular store, there's been no reaction," Ellard said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Browne, sales manager at Nugent Chevrolet, said most Lumina enthusiasts 
are in the 30-year-old to 40-year-old range, hardly the speedster crowd. 
</P>
<P>
At Daniel Chevrolet in Marina del Rey, however, sales manager Michael Borden 
said growing numbers of people, fresh from seeing "Days of Thunder," are taking 
a look at the Lumina, especially the red or black Euro models that include a 
spoiler. But Borden added that many customers remain confused about the nature 
of the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
"The MPV (mini-van) model is our best seller," Borden said. "But interest in 
the coupe is building through the movie. They probably should have named the 
van something else." 
</P>
<P>
Marketing and automobile experts agree that the Lumina line lacks a clear 
identity. Early promotional campaigns were squarely aimed at the family market. 
The Lumina sedan was named the "official car" of Disney World's Disney-MGM 
Studios Theme Park in Florida, and one television commercial even showed Disney 
cartoon characters parading around the auto. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrolet branched out by introducing a sportier two-door model and by placing 
the Lumina name on its version of General Motors' futuristic-looking mini-vans. 
Lumina took on yet another identity when it was recently refashioned as 
Chevrolet's entry in NASCAR competitions. The souped-up Lumina has thus far won 
about 44% of the races it has entered, Chevrolet says. 
</P>
<P>
One sponsor of Lumina racers, J. R. Hendrick III, is a friend of actor Cruise. 
And it was the two of them who reportedly persuaded Paramount to use the Lumina 
in "Days of Thunder." Chevrolet General Manager J. C. Perkins has boasted that 
the movie identifies Chevrolet as a winner. 
</P>
<P>
But Jon Lowell, a senior editor at Ward's Automotive Reports in Detroit, said 
the marketing strategy makes no sense. 
</P>
<P>
"What's particularly bizarre about using the Lumina in 'Days of Thunder' is 
that the cars on-screen are rear-wheel-drives powered by a V8 engine, neither 
of which is available on the showroom floor," he said. "This is a family 
sedan." 
</P>
<P>
Car &amp; Driver magazine last year noted that even the sportiest V6-model 
Lumina took 10.5 seconds to reach 60 miles per hour, not exactly race car 
speeds. "Almost everything about it is average," Car &amp; Driver concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by Chevrolet for the first half of the year show that the 
four-door sedan, the model that most appeals to families, has dominated Lumina 
sales, accounting for 56%. The two-door Euro made up only 15% of the car's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The basic model sells for about $15,000. Ward's reported that the Lumina was 
the seventh-most-popular car sold in America during the first half of the year. 
But it still ranked behind two other Chevrolets, the Corsica-Beretta and the 
Cavalier. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey B. Hirsch of Hirsch Marketing in Venice said the "Days of Thunder" 
tie-in could actually hurt the car. "The Lumina is not the same thing to all 
people, so there's some potential for confusion," he said. "Is this a family 
car or what? People may start to ask: 'What are we supposed to be doing with 
this car?' " 
</P>
<P>
Frank Devaney, an executive with public relations firm Rogers &amp; Cowan who 
specializes in car placements in films and television shows, agreed that the 
showroom Lumina may not live up to expectations, but said the car could still 
benefit from the association with Cruise. "People really do emulate their 
favorite stars," Devaney said. "And many of them will want to be like Cruise." 
</P>
<P>
Another placement specialist, Jim Hillson of Phase One, said any 
attention-grabbing device may prove helpful today. "It's a way to get something 
distinctive going in a market that is so cluttered it's hard to break anything 
through," Hillson said.

MANY WORKERS FEAR THE 'WORST IS YET TO COME'

McDonnell Douglas' announcement Monday that it will lay off up to 17,000 
workers, including 8,000 at Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach and 400 at the Space 
Systems division in Huntington Beach, was greeted with weary resignation by 
employees and appeared to do little to dampen internal speculation about the 
troubled company's future. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's pretty nervous," said one MD-80 production worker outside the 
gates of the Douglas facility in Long Beach. "There's a feeling that it's 
inevitable, but the worst is yet to come." 
</P>
<P>
No special meetings were held to inform workers about the cost-cutting plan, 
and only the broad outlines of the layoffs were disclosed in a memo addressed 
"To All Teammates." Some employees leaving work Monday afternoon were not aware 
that there had been a public announcement by the company, and the internal memo 
did not disclose specific layoff figures for individual plants. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't know what to believe," said Terence Collins, a Douglas 
maintenance worker from Riverside. He said that, while he had once taken 
comfort in the belief that workers involved in commercial aircraft production 
would not be laid off, he was no longer as sure. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense of panic for a lot of people," added Rhonda Robinson, an MD-80 
electrical worker. "They're cutting so many things at once." She said the 
elimination of services, such as shuttle buses to transport workers from the 
parking lots at the sprawling aircraft plant, has hurt morale and heightened 
employee fears about the future. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's announcement followed a week of apocalyptic rumors about a possible 
bankruptcy filing or a Japanese buyout of Douglas. But few workers said they 
believed that the latest layoffs will calm the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just going to add fuel to the fire," said one MD-11 structural worker 
who, like several other employees, asked that his name not be used. He said 
morale has suffered not only because of the layoffs, but also because of 
increasingly strict management policies aimed at boosting production. 
Supervisors, added another worker, "are really cracking the whip." 
</P>
<P>
There seemed to be less sense of foreboding at the Space Systems division in 
Huntington Beach, where the layoffs are less severe, but employees were still 
worried. "It's not that much of a shock, but (the number of layoffs) is higher 
than we anticipated," said Dale Donnelly, a systems analyst. "It's not going to 
diminish the stress completely." 
</P>
<P>
Another engineer, who asked not to be identified, called the announcement 
"depressing," and scoffed at management's explanation of the problem. "They 
blame it on defense cuts, but a lot of these are commercial programs." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell officials provided no breakdown of how the layoffs would be split 
between military and commercial work. 
</P>
<P>
Another engineer was upset about the cut in company contributions to the 
salaried savings plan, which he said amounted to a 3% pay cut and came as a 
complete surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a few of the employees interviewed expressed confidence that the company 
would find its way through the problems eventually. As one quality inspector 
put it, workers were relieved to "finally get some good, solid answers." 
</P>
<P>
And one Douglas worker expressed confidence that with the huge backlog of 
commercial aircraft orders, "even if I was laid off now, they'd probably call 
me back in January."

FCC Seeking to Cut Overseas Phone Rates: The Federal Communications Commission 
is seeking to force down international phone rates by 50% within three years, 
an action that could save American consumers billions of dollars a year, the 
New York Times reported. The agency contends that foreign telephone monopolies 
are keeping rates artificially high, despite cost-saving improvements in 
technology, the Times said. The FCC effort is likely to meet stiff resistance 
from foreign governments.

A federal judge on Monday ordered more than 100,000 cases nationwide involving 
victims of asbestos-related diseases consolidated into a single class action in 
a dramatic attempt to clear a huge court backlog. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise ruling by Thomas D. Lambros, chief judge of U.S. District Court in 
Cleveland, comes amid mounting problems with a trust set up by Manville Corp. 
to compensate workers killed or injured from handling asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs' lawyers said they expected the order to be challenged in a federal 
appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
The move preempted a similar action threatened by U.S. District Court Judge 
Jack B. Weinstein in Brooklyn, who has sought to take charge of fixing the 
financially ailing Manville trust fund and clearing the asbestos backlog. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein last week ordered the trust to halt all payments to victims until he 
receives a proposal on Aug. 6 to restructure and refinance the trust, which was 
created in 1988 as part of Manville's bankruptcy court reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
The trust is out of cash to pay new claims and has said that people who file 
claims now may not be compensated until well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos-related cases form the largest number of personal injury lawsuits in 
the country. Lambros said more than 100,000 claims have been filed in federal 
and state courts nationwide. Thousands of others await resolution with the 
Manville trust. 
</P>
<P>
Several dozen companies that manufactured asbestos and the Manville trust, 
which is legally separate from the company, are defendants in the cases. 
</P>
<P>
In a four-page order, Lambros said the asbestos litigation meets the 
requirement for creating a class action because "there are insufficient funds 
among all of the defendants to pay all meritorious claims" and the cost of 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said that since 1982, Manville and several other companies have 
sought bankruptcy court protection because of thousands of lawsuits seeking 
asbestos compensation, while other companies are "approaching the brink of 
bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
All cases filed under the umbrella of a class action are bound by a single 
court judgment, eliminating the need for individual trials and out-of-court 
settlements. It also raises the possibility of an adverse ruling that would 
affect all cases. 
</P>
<P>
Manville once was the nation's largest maker of asbestos, which was used widely 
for decades because of its natural heat resistance and insulation properties. 
It later was identified as carcinogenic. 
</P>
<P>
Manville, based in Denver, emerged from Chapter 11 proceedings in 1988 and no 
longer makes asbestos.

PACTEL TO HALVE MEDICAL PLANS FOR EMPLOYEES

Pacific Telesis Group said Monday that it will eliminate half of the health 
maintenance organizations it offers workers and retirees of the parent company 
and its Pacific Bell Telephone subsidiary in an effort to reduce health-care 
costs and provide more cost-effective health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The move, effective on Jan. 1, follows the utility's earlier announcement that 
it would revamp its overall health-care plan in response to settlement of the 
August, 1989, strike by the Communications Workers of America. 
</P>
<P>
The union struck Pac Bell for two weeks over proposed changes in Pac Bell's 
health-care plan. The new plan, which was also part of negotiations with other 
Pac Bell unions, affects some 100,000 employees of the parent company, Pac 
Bell, Nevada Bell and the Pacific Bell Directory unit. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement also follows predictions from health-care consultants that 
more and more large corporations would drastically reduce the number of HMO 
alternatives they offer employees. The result, they say, could be the 
elimination of some weak HMOs from the marketplace as companies apply more 
stringent tests in the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing the number of HMOs next year will allow the company "to better manage 
and control our HMO costs by building strong business partnerships with a few 
plans," said Jim Beck, Pac Bell director of health plans. 
</P>
<P>
Workers may choose to participate in one of five HMOs -- instead of the current 
10 -- or the new Pacific Bell Health Care Network, which will operate like an 
HMO.

MAXICARE'S REORGANIZATION PLAN APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DARNELL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana on Monday approved Maxicare Health 
Plan's reorganization proposal to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
The confirmation clears the last major hurdle for the Los Angeles-based health 
maintenance organization to be released from court supervision, but a Maxicare 
spokesman said additional technical requirements must be met for the plan to 
become effective. 
</P>
<P>
That is currently expected to happen in early October, ending a process that 
began on March 16, 1989, when Maxicare filed for protection under pressure from 
its bank lenders, other creditors and state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization plan requires that Maxicare meet certain cash requirements 
in different categories before the plan becomes effective. "We have a 
significant amount of cash on hand, but we still have to generate more. But we 
don't anticipate that will be a problem," Maxicare spokesman Ed Coughlan said. 
</P>
<P>
The company earlier received the necessary creditor and shareholder approval of 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
It calls for the distribution of $129.3 million in cash, $67 million in notes 
and new common stock and warrants to satisfy claims. Doctors and hospitals who 
continue to provide services to Maxicare members will own 49% of the new 
company. The new stock is expected to be issued shortly after the plan becomes 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thrilled with the significant progress we've made to date," Maxicare 
Chairman and Chief Executive Peter J. Ratican said in a statement. "By 
continuing to concentrate on providing good service along with access to 
quality managed care at a reasonable cost, we will increase our membership and 
our profitability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In confirming the plan, the court continued an injunction that prevents doctors 
and hospitals from billing Maxicare members for debts owed by the company.

SOUTHLAND BONDHOLDERS OK JAPANESE BID; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: THE ENHANCED OFFER LIFTS A HURDLE IN RESTRUCTURING THE CONVENIENCE 
STORE CHAIN AND COULD PUMP NEW LIFE INTO THE COMPANY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Efforts to sell troubled Southland Corp., parent of the 7-Eleven chain, took a 
major step forward Monday when the company's key bondholders accepted an 
improved buyout offer from Japanese investors. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement in principle appears to clear the main stumbling block for a deal 
that would be the biggest Japanese investment ever in U.S. retailing. Analysts 
say the buyout also would pump new life into Southland, which was brought to 
the verge of collapse by stepped-up competition and $1.8 billion in junk bond 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new offer, Ito-Yokado Co. and its Seven-Eleven Japan Co. unit would 
pay $430 million for 70% of Dallas-based Southland, the nation's biggest chain 
of convenience stores. The Thompson family -- which has owned or controlled 94% 
of Southland's stock since leading a costly buyout three years ago -- would 
wind up with only about 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Holders of bonds and preferred stock would get the remaining 25% of the 
company. In addition, bondholders would get new securities with an overall face 
value of $934 million in exchange for their current $1.8 billion in 
high-interest junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Southland said it hopes to complete the deal in mid-August. "This 
restructuring, coupled with the cash infusion from our partners in Japan, will 
help ensure that 7-Eleven remains the leader in the competitive convenience 
store industry," Clark Matthews, Southland's chief financial officer, said in a 
news release. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Southland announced an agreement to sell control of the company to 
Ito-Yokado, which in 1973 became its first licensee overseas. But bondholders 
rejected the first proposal as well as a second offer disclosed in June. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Ito-Yokado proposed paying $400 million for 75% of Southland while 
giving bondholders 10% of the company and $350 million in securities. 
</P>
<P>
John Gordon, chairman of a committee representing Southland bondholders and 
preferred shareholders, said the new agreement "is the best that could be 
achieved." He said he knows of no opposition to the deal by any investors. 
</P>
<P>
"One way or another, this deal is definitely going to happen," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement hinges on, among other things, the approval of holders of 95% of 
each of Southland's five categories of junk bond debt. In a news release, Clark 
Matthews, Southland's chief financial officer, said holders of more than 70% of 
the company's senior debt have already indicated their support. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of a Southland bankruptcy was a driving force behind the buyout 
agreement, which was reached in New York at 9:30 a.m. Southland went into 
default Monday morning on some of its junk bond debt after failing to make 
interest payments totaling $69 million in cash and $38 million in securities. 
</P>
<P>
A class-action suit seeking interest payments was filed against Southland 
Monday in Dallas, but it is not expected to force the company into bankruptcy 
now that an agreement has been reached with bondholders. A Southland 
spokeswoman said the company is withholding the interest to protect its 
liquidity and "financial flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
Southland's lead bankers, including Los Angeles-based Security Pacific, have 
not announced whether they approve of the agreement. The Southland spokeswoman, 
however, said the banks have been kept "well-informed" about the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Ito-Yokado's Seven-Eleven Japan unit is the biggest operator of convenience 
stores in Japan, with 3,940 outlets. It also bought 58 7-Eleven stores in 
Hawaii from Southland last December. 
</P>
<P>
Southland is the parent of a worldwide organization of 12,900 convenience 
stores.

PENNZOIL TO BOOST ITS STAKE IN EDGY CHEVRON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pennzoil Co., which already owns 8.8% of Chevron Corp., said Monday that it 
intends to boost its stake to just under 10%, the level at which Chevron's new 
"poison pill" takeover defense would be triggered. 
</P>
<P>
But Houston-based Pennzoil reiterated that its interest in Chevron is as a 
passive investment intended to defer taxes on the $2.6-billion net proceeds 
that it received from Texaco Inc. in 1988 to settle the fight for Getty Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue to believe that Chevron has the potential to be an attractive 
long-term investment for Pennzoil," wrote Pennzoil Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke and 
President and Chief Executive James L. Pate in a joint letter to shareholders 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Pennzoil disclosed that it had spent $2.12 billion of the 
settlement to amass a sizable stake in Chevron. Pennzoil at that time left open 
the possibility of investing the remaining $480 million in Chevron shares as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Pennzoil's disclosure Monday -- contained in a filing with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and the letter to shareholders -- made good on that. 
Pennzoil also filed with the Federal Trade Commission for permission to make 
the purchases under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to maximize the potential tax-deferral benefits of our investment, it 
is desirable for Pennzoil to invest up to the full $2.6 billion of net proceeds 
from the Texaco settlement prior to the end of 1990," Liedtke and Pate wrote to 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
In an amended Schedule 13-D filed with the SEC, Pennzoil said it will buy up to 
3,929,252 Chevron shares to be added to the 31,524,500 it already owns. The 
purchases will be made sometime between the middle of August and the end of the 
year, depending on market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
At Chevron's closing price of $74.875 Monday, the additional shares would cost 
about $294.2 million.

LABOR: ILLEGAL ALIEN LAW IS HERE TO STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A badly flawed government study was used by NAACP leaders last week as the 
excuse for joining militant Latinos and others in a campaign to be nicer to 
companies that use illegal aliens as a source of cheap, exploitable labor. 
</P>
<P>
The convention of the black civil rights group voted to ask Congress to get rid 
of a provision in the 1986 immigration reform act that imposed stiff penalties 
on companies that knowingly hire foreigners who are here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to switch sides and oppose employer sanctions was a good-will move 
by a few important black leaders toward Latino activists who have dragged their 
feet in the push for badly needed civil rights legislation to mitigate recent 
Supreme Court rulings against affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
The Latinos want more attention paid to the problems of illegals, and, as one 
Latino group official put it bluntly, Latinos no longer intend to let black 
Americans set the civil rights agenda. 
</P>
<P>
So a few weeks ago NAACP Executive Secretary Benjamin Hooks promised some Latin 
groups that he would get the NAACP to end its support of employer sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Hooks pushed the new policy through despite strong opposition from those who 
know that the availability of hard-pressed illegal aliens often depresses wages 
of other workers, especially low-income blacks. 
</P>
<P>
It was a victory for the militant Latinos and for Hooks' effort to improve 
relations between them and black leaders. But it was no more than a gesture 
because Congress isn't about to eliminate employer sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, to win the convention debate, Hooks relied on a recent 
government report that is also being used extensively by other opponents of the 
law, which for the first time in U.S. history provides for punishment of 
employers who exploit illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Hooks cited a General Accounting Office study that said the immigration law has 
caused "widespread discrimination" against Latino workers by employers who 
worry about mistakenly hiring a foreign-looking worker. 
</P>
<P>
Since the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People has been 
fighting discrimination for decades, the point was persuasive. However, Hooks 
didn't mention the withering criticism of the GAO report, particularly a 
written analysis by Eleanor Chelimsky, the GAO's own assistant comptroller 
general for program evaluation and methodology. 
</P>
<P>
Chelimsky analyzed her agency's report before it was released and declared 
flatly that its data didn't support the assertion that the law caused 
"widespread discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that there were no figures to compare discrimination before and after 
the law, and "since discrimination has always been with us," there was no way 
for the GAO to conclude that the law has caused a rise in discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The data was at best inconclusive and contradictory, Chelimsky wrote. She urged 
Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher not to issue the report as drafted. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the report was issued a few days later without any more surveys 
of workers or employers. Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) said the final report 
"merely softened the vigor of its statements linking employer sanctions to the 
discrimination it measured." 
</P>
<P>
Lowell Dodge, the GAO's director of administration of justice issues and a key 
player in developing the report, concedes that its conclusion was a "judgment 
call" based on the available data, and not on "conclusive evidence." 
</P>
<P>
He does believe that the law has increased the incidence of discrimination but 
concedes, "We could not quantify the amount because we did not have a base line 
to compare discrimination before and after the law passed." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Dodge said, "the evidence suggests this discrimination is related more to 
employer confusion about the law than to their fear of sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, unlike the Latino activists and now the NAACP, the GAO is not 
calling for an end to employer sanctions; instead it is sensibly urging 
simplification of the process employers use to verify the legal status of all 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Since workers can use any two of 17 easily forged forms of identification to 
show they are here legally, some employers find the verification process 
confusing. 
</P>
<P>
Several high-level studies are being conducted by Congress, the Justice 
Department, the General Accounting Office and others to find a simple, 
non-intrusive way for all workers to quickly show their eligibility for work. 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP also ignored the decades of furious debate that produced the 1986 
immigration reform. It was a splendid compromise. In return for employer 
sanctions, Congress set up the most extensive amnesty program ever extended to 
illegal aliens in any country. It is wisely giving legal status to about 2.5 
million illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major goals of the reform was to slow the flood of foreigners who 
were pouring into the United States without permission at an ever-increasing 
rate. The Urban Institute, which works with the GAO, estimated last week that 
illegal U.S. entries have been reduced by about 25% since the law was passed, 
although the rate is rising somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
The law will not entirely stop foreigners from coming here illegally. The 
prospect of getting U.S. jobs that pay far more than they can earn in their own 
countries is a powerful magnet. 
</P>
<P>
But their numbers have been reduced and can be cut more if the hunger too many 
companies have for cheap, undocumented labor is curbed by the threat of 
penalties against the companies. While a couple of unions trying to organize 
illegals have joined the campaign against punishing employers who hire them, 
the 14-million-member AFL-CIO warns that ending sanctions would be "an open 
invitation to unscrupulous employers" to step up the hiring of undocumented 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The law needs to be improved by simplifying the worker eligibility system and 
strengthening the anti-discrimination provisions. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the dumbest things Congress could do would be to tell employers that 
it's OK to hire those underpaid, easily abused illegals to compete with workers 
here. While it makes many mistakes, Congress doesn't seem ready to make that 
one.

MARKETING: MORE ADVERTISERS TRY WOOING BUSINESS CLIENTS WITH PERSONAL FREEBIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of us are suckers for free stuff. We'll fly more costly flights just to 
earn frequent-flyer miles on our favorite airlines. We'll stay at certain hotel 
chains that lure us with the prospect of earning free lodging. We'll even rent 
one brand of car over another just because one rental agency doles out free 
tote bags. 
</P>
<P>
What happens, however, when some clever marketer waves 20 free Corvettes in the 
public's face? And suppose the only way to win one of the flashy yellow sports 
cars was by renting a certain brand of truck -- not for your personal use, but 
for your company's? And further suppose that each time you rented a truck for 
your company, you were automatically entered. Would that be incentive enough to 
choose one truck rental company over another? Even if, perhaps, it wasn't 
necessarily the best bargain? 
</P>
<P>
You bet your Vette it would. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask the folks at Ryder Truck Rental, who are seeing a sudden spurt in 
truck rentals since their Corvette sweepstakes began earlier this summer. "To 
say we have a successful program on our hands is an understatement," said Jon 
Larrick, group director of marketing services at the Miami-based firm that will 
give away 20 of the $40,000 sports cars in October. "Business is up -- and not 
just 2% or 3%," said Larrick, who, for competitive reasons, declined to reveal 
just how much business has improved. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mead Data Central, the Dayton, Ohio, company that supplies on-line 
information to many of the Fortune 500 companies, is giving away a vacation 
valued at $10,000 and an Infiniti automobile in a sweepstakes for people who 
use its special computer services, including Nexis and Lexis. To make its 
point, Mead recently mailed thousands of picture postcards of Moscow's Red 
Square to key decision makers at companies that subscribe to its service. Each 
employee who received a postcard was asked to use the service more often in 
order to increase his or her chances of winning either the trip or the car. 
Bear in mind, Mead's service fees are based primarily on usage. 
</P>
<P>
Behind these sweepstakes -- and others like them -- is a somewhat murky ethical 
issue that a growing number of companies and their employees must deal with 
these days. Are shrewd marketing practices playing too big a role in the 
purchasing decisions each of us make at work? 
</P>
<P>
"The word for this is bribery," said Jay Levinson, a San Rafael, Calif., 
marketing consultant and author of the best-selling book, "Guerrilla 
Marketing." "You're bribing someone any time you offer them something beyond 
what you're selling. But it's amazingly effective. It almost always works." 
</P>
<P>
What is the real appeal here? "Greed," said Gerard J. Tellis, an associate 
professor of marketing at USC. "It's a shrewd attempt to appeal to the selfish 
motives many people have." 
</P>
<P>
Some marketing executives trace the roots of all this back to 1981, when 
American Airlines was the first to offer free trips to its frequent flyers. It 
wasn't long before others got into the act: The big hotel chains doled out free 
rooms and the car rental companies gave away free rentals. Today, the stakes 
have been raised to expensive sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
"This all raises a ticklish question," Levinson points out. Who keeps the loot? 
Employee or company? 
</P>
<P>
Each contest sponsor has a different theory on how to award the prizes. Ryder 
awards the prize to the company that rents the truck -- and lets the company 
decide who keeps it. On the other hand, Mead tries to make everyone happy. It 
awards separate prizes to the individuals who enter the sweepstakes and to the 
companies they work for. 
</P>
<P>
Are companies across America going to have to hire corporate vice presidents of 
prizes? Not likely. The only perk that seems to concern most companies is 
frequent-flyer mileage. Even then, fewer than 20% of U.S. companies require 
that employees turn in their mileage, said Jack Witherspoon, chairman of the 
National Business Travel Assn. But it isn't the fear of angering employees that 
keeps most companies from taking away these miles. Rather, Witherspoon said, 
it's the high administrative cost of tracking mileage from large numbers of 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Chrysler has kept its employees' frequent-flyer mileage since 1985. "We 
realized some employees were booking more expensive flights just to accumulate 
mileage," said James Kenyon, news media relations manager at Chrysler Corp. "At 
first, the program was not viewed very kindly, but now it's accepted as a way 
of doing business here." 
</P>
<P>
These days, however, lots more than free mileage is up for grabs. But the 
executives whose companies are sponsoring sweepstakes insist that they are 
good-natured promotions. 
</P>
<P>
"If the service isn't there, even the prospect of winning a Corvette will not 
motivate a customer to rent a truck," said Ryder's Larrick. Added Jim Joseph, 
manager of public communications for Mead Data Central: "We haven't received 
any complaints from companies that said, 'Since you sponsored this contest, our 
bill has shot up sky-high.' "

Westin Century Plaza Checks In New Agency 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest hotels in Los Angeles has handed its advertising business to 
one of the area's smallest agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Westin Century Plaza Hotel &amp; Tower last week assigned its estimated 
$1-million advertising budget to Stein Robaire Helm, a 2-year-old agency with 
annual billings of about $20 million. The account was formerly handled by HDM, 
the Los Angeles agency that continues to handle corporate advertising for 
Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts as well as a handful of individual Westin hotels. 
</P>
<P>
With its business off, the Century Plaza has decided to "rethink" its 
advertising strategy, said Greg J. Helm, president of the hotel's new agency. 
In future campaigns, the hotel will attempt to differentiate its more upscale 
Tower suites from those in the main hotel, said Helm. Generally, rooms in the 
Tower section are about 25% more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They Hope Appetizers Lead to Main Course 
</P>
<P>
Advertising agencies often take small pieces of business from large advertisers 
with high hopes of eventually winning even bigger slices of the pie. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the local office of Bozell Inc. walked off with its first piece of 
Kodak, and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS/Pacific earned another chunk of 
Yamaha-related business. 
</P>
<P>
Saatchi won Yamaha Corp.'s Riva scooter account, which posts annual billings of 
less than $1 million. Meanwhile, a tiny division of Kodak, Santa Monica-based 
Interactive Systems Inc., handed its estimated $2-million account to the Los 
Angeles office of Bozell Inc. Interactive Systems makes devices that help make 
software more "friendly" to users. "The Kodak connection is the icing on the 
cake," said Renee White Fraser, vice president and general manager at Bozell. 
</P>
<P>
Saatchi already creates ads for Yamaha snowmobiles, motorcycles, all-terrain 
vehicles, lawn tractors, generators and snow blowers. There is still plenty of 
Yamaha business that the agency doesn't handle -- including its golf clubs, 
golf carts and marine products. Does the agency want it all? Said Joseph 
Cronin, agency president, "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Green Image Could Yield Greenbacks 
</P>
<P>
The marketing environment certainly is right for companies to be 
environmentally sensitive. But few consumers can name even one company that 
fills the environmental bill. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent nationwide survey, 410 people were asked if the environment played 
an important role in their purchase decisions. About 96% of those interviewed 
said it did. But not a single company or brand was mentioned by more than 5% of 
the consumers as being environmentally friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"No one company has yet established itself as being environmentally aware in 
the minds of consumers," said Susan Small-Weil, executive vice president of the 
New York ad agency Warwick Baker &amp; Fiore, which co-sponsored the survey 
with Adweek's Marketing Week. "A large opportunity exists for a company to be 
the first to establish itself in this arena." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hakuhodo Hires L.A. Ad Executive 
</P>
<P>
After his Los Angeles agency went belly up, Tom Burr sat around for about a 
month and waited for the phone to ring. It didn't. 
</P>
<P>
But Burr, 59, who co-founded the now defunct Abert, Newhoff &amp; Burr, started 
spreading the word that he was looking for work. Last week -- nearly five 
months after his agency disbanded -- Burr was named senior vice president at 
Hakuhodo Advertising's Los Angeles office. He becomes the top-ranking American 
in the office. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Hakuhodo was sued by a disgruntled former executive who 
claimed that the agency discriminated against Americans. "I've seen nothing 
that would suggest there's any merit to that," said Burr. Besides, he pointed 
out, "they hired me, and I'm an American."

EXXON TO UNVEIL LESS POLLUTING PREMIUM GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The oil company that gave the world the Exxon Valdez oil spill hopes to score 
some environmental points with consumers by introducing lower-emissions 
gasolines in California today, joining three other refiners already selling 
such fuel here. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Corp., the West Coast's fifth-largest retailer of gasoline last year, is 
expected to unveil a reformulation of its Exxon Extra premium unleaded gasoline 
at about 175 stations in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Another version of the gasoline will go on sale at the same time in Sacramento 
and San Francisco -- the first such fuels in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope this is a small step toward convincing people that we're not as bad as 
they may think we are," Exxon marketing executive Paul White said. "We do care 
about the environment." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Exxon estimates that the new gasoline will cut a vehicle's 
hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions by about 7%, compared to its ordinary 
premium unleaded gasoline, which the new fuel will replace. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, which will have a different version of the gasoline, 
the new Exxon Extra will cut hydrocarbon emissions by only 4% and will have no 
effect on carbon monoxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon already sells different lower-emissions formulations of gasoline in 24 
other states along the Gulf Coast and in the Northeast and Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, Exxon joins Chevron Corp., Shell Oil Co. and Atlantic 
Richfield Co., the West Coast's No. 1 retailer, which last September introduced 
the first lower-emissions gasoline in the country. Both Chevron and Shell sell 
reduced-emissions premium unleaded gasoline in Los Angeles.

SANDS ASSUMES LEASES ON 4 GLICKMAN REALTY OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brentwood-based Fred Sands Realtors was awarded on Monday the leases on four of 
the five offices previously occupied by the bankrupt Mike Glickman Realty Inc., 
formerly the San Fernando Valley's largest residential brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Sands' plan to assume the leases on offices in Encino, Sherman Oaks, Agoura and 
Northridge was accepted by the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles, which 
must approve all transactions involving Glickman creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman, once considered the golden boy of Valley real estate, filed for 
personal and corporate bankruptcy liquidation July 5. Three days later Glickman 
announced his plans to become a marketing executive for Jon Douglas Co. of 
Beverly Hills, Sands' biggest rival. At the time, Douglas said he hoped to 
assume the Glickman leases. 
</P>
<P>
But Jim Matthews, a paralegal in the office of the trustee for Glickman's 
estate, said Douglas dropped out of the bidding after Sands submitted his final 
plan to the court. Douglas could not be reached for comment Monday.

KBET RADIO TRIES PROGRAM TRADING TO STAY ON AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only radio station in the Santa Clarita Valley, which was late in debuting 
on the air a year ago, is now battling against an early exit. 
</P>
<P>
KBET, beset with financial and legal problems, last Tuesday indefinitely laid 
off its five on-air personalities -- without pay -- and temporarily changed its 
programming to air only Beatles songs, said Carl Goldman, a consultant brought 
in to oversee the station's restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the station's owner, Canyon Broadcasters Inc. in Canyon Country, is 
negotiating to sell the 1,000-watt station to an unidentified party, said Paul 
Rossilli, one of the company's investors. 
</P>
<P>
Until its switch to Beatles music a week ago, the station (1220 AM) offered a 
combination of contemporary music, news and other programs with on-air 
personalities such as "Barry and the Beast," two morning broadcast disc 
jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
But the format "was not getting enough advertising support" and KBET "was 
definitely losing money," even though the station was an alternative to the 
otherwise bad radio reception that the valley's 150,000 residents receive, 
Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
One problem: The station decided the adult contemporary music it played failed 
to enlist a strong following because it was too broad, including everything 
"from Bon Jovi to Chuck Berry," Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
The station is now playing recordings of various artists while it decides 
whether to go with a narrower adult contemporary program, oldies or 
country-Western music. Once that's decided, KBET will decide which of its 
on-air personalities will be called back, Goldman said. Five other KBET 
employees have continued working. 
</P>
<P>
KBET hit the airwaves June 28, 1989, more than six months behind schedule. It 
was a contentious debut because Larry Bloomfield of Canyon Country, who tried 
for years to establish the station, was fired as KBET's president two months 
earlier by the station's other owners. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Bloomfield and Canyon Broadcasters filed suits against each other 
in Superior Court, claiming the other was responsible for cost overruns and 
delays in the station's start-up. Canyon Broadcasters is hoping to quickly 
resolve the suits before the station is sold, Rossilli said.

LAWSUIT ACCUSES CURB'S FIRM OF PIRATING SONG; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: RIGHTS TO A COMPACT DISC REMIX OF SAMMY DAVIS JR.'S 'CANDY MAN' ARE AT 
STAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Who can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew, cover it in chocolate and a 
miracle or two? Sammy Davis Jr. had an answer for that. 
</P>
<P>
But who can take an old recording of Davis singing "The Candy Man," remix it 
with a miracle of modern technology and sell it on a new compact disc? 
</P>
<P>
That's apparently a question for the courts. 
</P>
<P>
DCC Compact Classics Inc. of Northridge filed suit June 13 in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles against Curb Records of Burbank accusing the company of 
record piracy in releasing a version of the song on a compact disc called 
"Sammy Davis Jr./Greatest Songs." DCC's suit seeks more than $5 million in 
damages, plus court costs. 
</P>
<P>
But understanding the case and the complex history of the recording is not 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
Curb Records is owned by former Lt. Gov. Mike Curb. His attorney Joel R. Strote 
said Curb Records obtained rights to the recording from Polygram Records in New 
York. "Mr. Curb is a valid licensee of the rights to 'Candy Man' and that's 
just a fact," Strote said. He declined to comment further on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Griefer Swidler, an attorney for Polygram, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
However, DCC President Marshall Blonstein said his company (formerly Dunhill 
Compact Classics) obtained rights to use the master version of the "Candy Man" 
recording directly from Davis, then remixed and released it on a compact disc 
in 1988 titled "Sammy Davis, Jr./Greatest Hits." 
</P>
<P>
Davis died in May of throat cancer at age 64. Barry A. Menes, an attorney for 
Davis' Transamerican Entertainment Corp. said that Davis obtained the master to 
the "Candy Man" recording after a 1976 agreement between the singer and MGM 
Records. Polygram had acquired MGM Records in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Menes said he was in the process of looking for records of the agreement and 
hadn't looked at the DCC suit closely. 
</P>
<P>
The liner notes on the dueling companies' compact discs don't make the dispute 
any clearer. For example, DCC's notes acknowledge that Mike Curb was one of two 
producers of the original recording of "Candy Man" that DCC later remixed for 
its compact disc. In fact, Curb was president of MGM Records for nearly four 
years until 1973. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Curb's liner notes acknowledge that someone named Steve 
Hoffman remixed the version of the song included on Curb Records' release. Yet 
that's the very same Steve Hoffman who did the remix for DCC, according to 
DCC's suit. Indeed, Hoffman, according to the suit, is a DCC employee. 
</P>
<P>
DCC specializes in taking records that were best sellers 15 to 20 years ago or 
more, using special equipment to remove the hissing and popping from the old 
masters, then releasing them on compact disc. Besides two Davis discs, DCC's 72 
titles include works by artists like Leon Russell and the late Harry Chapin. 
</P>
<P>
But it's tough to make a profit on the relatively small numbers of discs DCC 
sells: The company lost $151,609 on sales of $2.02 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the '70s, Curb and his company produced records for Marie Osmond and Debby 
Boone, including Boone's "You Light Up My Life." Curb also produced a movie 
called "The Cycle Savages," for which he was later criticized by his Democratic 
opponent for Lieutenant Governor in the 1986 election, Leo T. McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
As a Republican lieutenant governor under Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown from 1979 
to 1983, Curb was known for trying to take advantage of his temporary powers 
while Brown was out of the state. He was defeated in his bid for the governor's 
office in 1982, then ran again for the state's No. 2 post four years later but 
lost to McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
For now it seems the dispute between the companies will have to be settled by a 
federal court judge who, strangely enough, had a minor encounter with Davis 
more than 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the attorneys representing the companies, David W. Williams, 
senior judge in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, said he'd once been 
retained to represent Davis after the 1954 highway accident that cost the 
entertainer his left eye. But a few days later, another attorney called and 
told Williams that Davis had hired him, replacing Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"At this period of time," Williams wrote in the letter, "Mr. Davis may have 
been in the early years of his career as an entertainer, but I was totally 
unaware of who he was, or that he was in show business."

PRESIDENT OF UNITED EDUCATION &amp; SOFTWARE INC. RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Education &amp; Software Inc., the parent of embattled trade-school 
operator United Education &amp; Software, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization last December, said Aaron Cohen resigned Friday as president and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen was replaced by United Education's chairman, Stanley R. Schoen. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen also announced plans to resign as president and chief executive of the 
company's subsidiary, but that must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, 
the company said. Cohen will remain on the boards of directors of the parent 
and subsidiary and will serve as a consultant to both. 
</P>
<P>
United Education's troubles started in 1988 when a government probe uncovered 
major foul-ups at its former student loan-processing subsidiary, including 
failure to notify delinquent borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, its problems mounted when the California Student Aid Commission, the 
state agency that administers the federal student loan program, responded to a 
federal audit that found widespread mismanagement at one of United Education's 
schools. As a result of the audit, it said the school should be banned from the 
loan program. 
</P>
<P>
Facing several lawsuits, including a $24-million suit filed by the state of 
California, United Education filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 4. Since 
then, the firm has sold or closed 12 of its 26 trade schools and closed its 
Encino headquarters. The company is now run from one of its schools in downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
C. Ronald Kimberling, United Education's executive vice president, said that 
since the bankruptcy filing, Cohen has been involved primarily with the 
company's reorganization plan and has removed himself from involvement in 
day-to-day operations. "He just felt it was time to step back," Kimberling 
said.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: NEWHALL LAND &amp; FARMING DOUBLES PROFIT FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co., a real estate developer and agricultural 
concern based in Valencia, said its second-quarter profit more than doubled 
from a year earlier, to $6.5 million from $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall, whose year-to-year earnings often vary widely depending on the number 
of properties it sells, attributed the gain to strong housing sales in Valencia 
which closed escrow in the quarter that ended June 30, and to sales of 
industrial land. The earnings gain came on a jump in revenue, to $32 million 
from $18.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1990, Newhall's profit rose to $19.6 million from $11.5 
million, and its six-month revenue climbed to $93.3 million from $67.3 million.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: BLACK BOX HOPES TO RAISE $98 MILLION WITH OFFERINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Black Box Inc. in Simi Valley said it plans to raise about $98 million with an 
initial public offering of 4.5 million common shares and an offering of $35 
million in subordinated debentures, a type of debt security. 
</P>
<P>
Black Box is the parent company of Micom Communications, which makes devices 
that enable computers to share information, and Black Box Corp., a mail-order 
business for data communications products. 
</P>
<P>
Black Box Inc. was taken private as part of a $334-million leveraged buyout of 
the former Micom Systems in 1988 by the New York investment firm Odyssey 
Partners. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to use the proposed offerings' proceeds to help fund a 
recapitalization plan, which includes buying back a portion of the company's 
existing debt, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The common shares registered with the SEC would represent about 58% of Black 
Box's stock after the offering, and are expected to sell for between $12 and 
$14 a share, the filing said. 
</P>
<P>
Black Box also said its private exchange offer for $110 million of subordinated 
debt ended Wednesday. It said $100 million, or about 91% of the notes offered, 
were exchanged.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: PIONEER BUYS 5.1% OF LIVE ENTERTAINMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pioneer Electronic Corp., a Japanese consumer electronics concern, has acquired 
preferred stock that's convertible into 5.1%, or 531,632 common shares, of Live 
Entertainment Inc., a Van Nuys home video and music distributor and retailer. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on 
July 3 Pioneer bought 60,000 Live convertible preferred shares for $1,000 each, 
or $60 million, from New Carolco Investments B.V., a Netherlands corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Of those shares, 15,000 are convertible into 531,632 common shares of stock. 
Pioneer said in the filing that it purchased the stock for "investment 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Live is 48%-owned by Carolco Pictures Inc., a Los Angeles film producer. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Live said it renamed its home video subsidiary Live Home Video Inc. 
The subsidiary was previously called International Video Entertainment Inc., or 
IVE. Live said it changed the unit's name to more closely associate it with the 
parent company. 
</P>
<P>
Live also said that Live Home Video's Family Home Entertainment label would 
release the box-office hit "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" on video Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
And Live Entertainment said it applied for the listing of its common stock on 
the New York Stock Exchange. Live Entertainment currently trades on the NASDAQ 
National Market System. The company expects to begin Big Board trading on 
Wednesday.

AFRICA'S FUTURE RIDING THE TRAIN TO NOWHERE;

AFTER A PERIOD OF REAL OPTIMISM IN THE 1970S, THE REGION HAS FALLEN FURTHER 
BEHIND THE REST OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DAR-ES-SALAAM, Tanzania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tanzania-Zambia Railway could well be a metaphor for Africa's path in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Known as Tazara, the 1,100-mile, Chinese-built line linking the copper belt of 
Zambia to this Tanzanian port was turned over to the governments of the two 
abutting countries just before the decade began. Included were 128 new 
locomotives and hundreds of passenger and freight cars to run on the gleaming 
rails. Western countries contributed millions of dollars to maintain the right 
of way and to train railroad staff. 
</P>
<P>
Today, little more than a decade after its opening, only 39 of the engines 
remain in working order. Another 39 are awaiting repair, and 50 have been 
destroyed by collisions and derailings on the deteriorating line. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a Swedish development agency donated 350 new cars to the railway -- 
enough, it has been estimated, to last only seven years at the current rate of 
wreckage. Some of the cars derailed on their maiden journey, the Swedes 
recently complained in a blistering letter to the two governments. 
</P>
<P>
Like Tazara, whose fate is the result of chronic African maladies of 
inattention, lack of maintenance, and penury, so went most of the continent in 
the 1980s. Development experts describe sub-Saharan Africa as a train running 
downhill to disaster. 
</P>
<P>
After a period of genuine hope in the 1970s, these experts describe the 1980s 
as the region's lost decade. By almost every measure of human welfare and 
economic health, the area retrogressed during that period, in some cases so 
sharply that Barber Conable, head of the World Bank, remarked recently that 
most Africans today are every bit as poor as they were 30 years ago, at the 
dawn of the continent's era of independence. 
</P>
<P>
"There was general deterioration in the main macroeconomic indicators, 
widespread disintegration of productive facilities, a rapid worsening in the 
social scene, repeated droughts and accelerating environmental degradation," 
says a U.N. report. "The unending crisis did not affect only the current 
well-being of the average African; it threatened the long-term development 
prospects of the region as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s saw many of Africa's modest gains of the previous 10 or 15 years 
swept off in a windstorm of deteriorating roads, disappearing forest and 
cropland, collapsing schoolhouses, and mushrooming military budgets. 
</P>
<P>
One can debate which African capital has the biggest potholes on its 
thoroughfares. Efforts to stem deforestation by planting fast-growing 
eucalyptus trees fail because Africans who need wood for fuel cut them down 
faster than they can grow. Ethiopia, which ranks close to rock-bottom in almost 
every measure of welfare and development known to humankind, spends more than 
50% of its budget on weapons to fight a largely stalemated 30-year civil war 
with Eritrean rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Many fear that the 1990s will be worse. For one thing, the rest of the world is 
losing interest in a place that never seems to get better. 
</P>
<P>
"The broad international support for helping a continent in distress in the 
1980s has been dissipated now by repeated calls for assistance," says Salim 
Lone, a Kenyan who edits Africa Recovery, a U.N. journal of development news. 
"How long can people accept that Africa is a special place, when the economic 
and political returns from Eastern Europe are infinitely greater?" 
</P>
<P>
Africa no longer has a geopolitical card to play. Gone are the days when 
Ethiopia and Somalia could play the East and West off against each other by 
switching allegiance between the United States and the Soviet Union. Zaire can 
no longer earn millions in U.S. aid as a staging base for anti-Marxist rebels 
in neighboring Angola, where Cuban troops have been on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, certain places in Africa could compete for attention by turning 
to the East or West," Lone says. "But now East-West amity has stripped the 
continent of whatever strategic value it had before." 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 40 countries of black Africa south of the Sahara Desert are 
increasingly detached from the rest of the world in economic terms, too. Their 
export crops, such as coffee and tea, are not rare or highly valued. Their 
appetites for foreign industrial goods remain high, but the scarcity of foreign 
currency to buy them means that hospitals and shoe factories alike crumble for 
want of spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 1970s, the continent had a healthy trade surplus of $29 
billion with the rest of the world. Today, with reduced export income and 
higher import prices, it has a trade deficit of $7.7 billion. Sub-Saharan 
Africa's share of world trade is 1.7%. 
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product of the entire region, which has twice the population 
of the United States, is roughly equivalent to that of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question as to who bears the burden of this economic estrangement: 
the poor. Africa has a near-monopoly on the bottom rankings of countries in 
terms of social welfare. Nine of the 10 countries with the lowest life 
expectancies in the world are African. Sierra Leone and Ethiopia have life 
expectancies of 42 years, tied for lowest with Afghanistan. The others are 
Guinea (43); Mali, Angola and Niger (45), and Somalia, Central African Republic 
and Chad (46). 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 10 countries with the highest infant mortality rates are also 
African: Mozambique and Angola, both the scenes of civil wars, are tied for the 
worst (172 per 1,000 live births), followed by Mali (168), Sierra Leone and 
Ethiopia (153), Malawi (149), Guinea (146), Burkina Faso (137) and Niger (134). 
</P>
<P>
Six of the 10 countries with the lowest literacy rates and eight of the 10 
countries with the lowest rate of access to safe water are also in sub-Saharan 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that such unrelieved misery is straining the social 
fabric. The street protests and riots spreading across Africa this year in a 
demand for new political systems are rooted in the poverty afflicting every 
country. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 people were killed in five days of street clashes last week in 
Kenya, where the unrest, starting with an informal rally against the country's 
one-party system, was fed by legions of the unemployed and underemployed who 
fill Nairobi and every other African metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
The geographic characteristics of many of these nations mean they will never be 
rich, or perhaps even self-sufficient. In the roll of dishonor above, it should 
be noted that Mali, Niger, Chad and Somalia are desert countries with 
significant populations of nomadic herders. Burkina Faso, once known as Upper 
Volta, is on the edge of the encroaching desert. Central African Republic and 
Malawi are landlocked. 
</P>
<P>
A great belt of the continent lies within the so-called intertropical zone, or 
ITZ, the swath of Earth between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn where 
weather patterns are the most unpredictable and crop failures frequent. 
</P>
<P>
But the record is not much better in the comparatively richly endowed states of 
this region. Zambia, which has vast stretches of arable land, recently had to 
issue ration cards to its huge population of city dwellers because bread and 
wheat were in such short supply. When the government tried to raise prices of 
these staples last month, food riots erupted, taking 23 lives. In Kenya, 
perhaps the biggest success story among African economies, foreign aid amounts 
to 30% of the government budget, which obviously cannot be balanced without it. 
</P>
<P>
When Ghana gained its independence in 1957 to usher in the continent's 
post-colonial period, it was rich from an annual crop of the world's 
highest-quality cocoa beans and from the gold mines that accounted for its 
colonial-era name of Gold Coast. Two coups and a series of inept economic 
policies followed. Today, foreign investors are trying to resurrect mines that 
have lain unused for 10 years, and the cocoa crop is insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
Ghana boasts the lowest minimum wage in Africa, and even upper-level civil 
servants can feed their families only once a day. At one point in the 1980s, a 
two-income household in which both workers received minimum wage could afford 
less than 10% of the lowest-cost diet needed to meet minimum nutritional needs. 
</P>
<P>
Africa's lost decade could not have come at a worse time. The 1990s will see a 
surge in regional trade alliances like the European market, while sub-Saharan 
Africa's 40 countries are still waging border skirmishes and erecting new 
customs barriers that inhibit competitiveness. Regional trade compacts such as 
the East African Community, involving Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, have either 
collapsed or, like the ambitious Economic Community of West African States, 
proven totally ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
The world technological revolution will pick up its pace as computers and fax 
machines become increasingly indispensable tools of economic growth. These 
machines depend on adequate telephone service, but in Africa fewer than one 
person in 300 has access to a telephone -- half the level of service as Asia's 
and one-sixteenth that in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"These factors can only lead to the further marginalization of Africa in the 
1990s and beyond," warns Adebayo Adedegi, head of the U.N. Economic Commission 
for Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Africa's inability to emerge from its long decline has provoked a raging debate 
among development experts about the reasons -- and particularly about the 
extent to which Western aid policies themselves should be blamed. Some argue 
that the nature of the aid bureaucracy -- tens of thousands of technocrats and 
administrators paid at Western, not African, wage scales -- overstates the 
amount of actual aid that has flowed into Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"You talk about billions of dollars going to Africa -- but how much of that 
actually benefits Africans?" remarks one U.N. Development Program official in 
West Africa. "Every European official here costs $100,000 to $150,000 a year to 
support, plus equipment, cars and so on. By the time you're finished, half the 
money in any program is spent." 
</P>
<P>
Much of what is left has gone into project financing -- the construction of 
demonstration farms, model factories and so on. Africa is littered with the 
rusted and gutted hulks of these well-intentioned but poorly planned edifices. 
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, for example, foreign donors in the early 1980s eagerly studied 
statistics on fish landings from rich Lake Victoria and paid for a 
multimillion-dollar fish processing plant on the lake shore in the district of 
Mwanza. The plant had an immense appetite for fish, and Mwanza's fishermen 
obligingly supplied it -- overfishing their portion of the vast lake so 
severely that it became a dead body of water. Today the plant is shuttered and 
crumbling, its lifeblood exploited into extinction. 
</P>
<P>
African leaders themselves have done little to respond to external challenges, 
30 years after independence and more than a decade after commodity prices 
collapsed. Instead of diversifying, the vast majority of these countries still 
depend on their top three commodity exports for 75% or more of their foreign 
earnings. Generally these are commodities, such as coffee and tea, in which the 
countries compete with each other in already glutted foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
The search for new markets is uneven, but often rewarding: Kenya responded to 
the collapse in the prices of coffee and tea by encouraging its small 
horticulture industry. Today the country is the world's fourth-biggest exporter 
of cut flowers. 
</P>
<P>
African leaders talk incessantly about how the national borders drawn up by the 
former colonial powers institutionalized political tensions by arbitrarily 
dividing some tribes and combining others. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years of economic history suggests the problem is not necessarily the 
wrong borders, but too many of them. Many sub-Saharan countries are simply too 
small or too deprived to be self-sufficient. Eleven are landlocked. Thirty-four 
have fewer than 10 million people. The distribution of natural resources is 
uneven: Zambia, with 7.5 million people, has copper and broad swaths of arable 
land -- largely unused -- while in neighboring Malawi, a similar population is 
crowded on one-seventh as much territory and with no mineral deposits at all. 
</P>
<P>
African leaders complain, quite fairly, that in granting independence their 
European colonial masters left them with inadequate roads and railroads and a 
pitifully small cadre of university-educated leaders. But it is clear now that 
these leaders themselves must shoulder much of the blame for their countries' 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
One key is the persistence of failed policies. Many African statesmen formed 
their economic ideas in the crucible of anti-colonialism: They reacted against 
not only European politics, but also European free-market economics, which they 
saw as exploitative. Great leaders like Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and Julius K. 
Nyerere of Tanzania created something called "African socialism," based on what 
they contended was Africans' unique sense of community and self-help. 
</P>
<P>
Today Zambia and Tanzania are among Africa's most dismal failures. Nyerere's 
catch-phrase, articulated in the "Arusha Declaration" of 1967, was "socialism 
and self-reliance." But after decades of receiving the highest per-capita 
foreign aid in all sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania is one of the world's least 
self-reliant countries. 
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, whose frequent emotional, even tearful, public speeches on the evils of 
nuclear proliferation and other scarcely relevant issues have made him a figure 
of worldwide respect, has presided over the collapse of one of Africa's most 
promising lands. Zambia became independent blessed with the best industrial 
base in southern Africa; it has been left a rotting skeleton through the 
mismanagement of state-owned enterprises operating in an environment of 
unbridled corruption. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows that to run a socialist enterprise you need good management to 
make up for the lack of individual incentives like the profit motive," one 
Scandinavian development official said in discussing the disastrous record of 
state-owned farms in nominally Marxist Ethiopia. "Of course, management skills 
are the one thing most lacking in Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Wherever the blame lies, the toll of Africa's marginalization is enormous. The 
U.N. Development Program recently noted that "between 1979 and 1985 the number 
of African people below the poverty line increased by almost two-thirds, 
compared with an average increase of one-fifth in the entire developing world." 
</P>
<P>
The urgency embodied in this figure has, oddly enough, led development 
officials to contemplate how the "quick fixes" of the 1970s and 1980s went 
awry: The manipulations of currency rates and the rapid infusions of aid money 
and project ideas that frequently canceled each other out or duplicated effort 
-- all without helping Africans build and sustain their own institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Some development experts say what Africa needs may be something approaching 
benign neglect. If the developed world does begin to withdraw attention and 
resources from the embattled continent, one notes, it may finally wean itself 
from the diet of aid. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a positive side," he says. "It may actually encourage governments to 
adopt policies that will be much more self-reliant and not as dependent on 
outside resources." 
</P>

Africa and Third World: Region Falls Behind

Not only do the nearly 40 countries of black Afric live in a different economic 
world than the industrialized countries; they are slipping behind the rest of 
the THird World by many key measures of development. The burden of the region's 
economic alienation is carried by the poor, such as the displaced villagers, 
below, gathered to collect food aid in Mozambique.

<P>
"Mitterrand or Bush?" a Syrian intelligence officer asked the blonde woman 
waiting to cross the so-called Green Line that divides war-torn Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
French or American? The question implied that anything else would be 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush," the woman replied, producing a smile, a salute and no further 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
But the next person in line, a Lebanese, was asked for his papers. There was no 
smile, no salute. His papers were carefully scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
Being an American may be helpful in getting past checkpoints manned by the 
Syrian military, but given the six American hostages still held by one faction 
or another, Lebanese friends think that an American who stays on here must have 
a death wish. 
</P>
<P>
"Dye your hair," they urge. "Never let on that you're a journalist." 
</P>
<P>
True, Beirut is chaotic. After more than a decade of civil war, and despite the 
presence of Syrian troops who were brought in to keep the peace, there is still 
an occasional gunfight in the street, a car bomb, an exchange of artillery 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
People go about their lives as best they can. Every morning, as early as 5:30, 
joggers and walkers appear on West Beirut's seaside corniche, among them Khalil 
Dayya, a security expert trained in Canada, and Father Germanos el Hage, a 
Greek Orthodox priest. 
</P>
<P>
Most are gone by 7 o'clock. This gives them time to stop at the baker's on the 
way home. And the men with children have to escort them to school. 
</P>
<P>
About this time the hanging baskets begin to appear. This is an old practice 
here, and it was widely adopted in January, when the city's main electric power 
grid was knocked out by artillery fire. 
</P>
<P>
Apartment-house dwellers tie a wicker basket to a length of laundry line and 
dangle it from the balcony. Seven-story drops are common. The practiced 
resident can place the basket at just the right height for the men who deliver 
newspapers and groceries. 
</P>
<P>
An Italian restaurant, the Moreno, has recently taken to making deliveries in 
this manner. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters, the British news agency, is using the basket. Reuters' building has 
its own electric power generators, but they won't run the elevator up to the 
agency's fifth-floor offices. So the basket brings up sandwiches and fruit from 
shops nearby, along with an occasional statement from one of the gangs that 
hold the hostages. A long buzz on the battery-operated signal downstairs means 
lower the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Resourceful Lebanese have worked out more up-to-date communications systems. 
When the power went out in January, the government telephone service went with 
it. So opportunists arranged to have international lines brought in from 
Cyprus. In addition to telephone service, they offer telex and facsimile, or 
fax. 
</P>
<P>
With their help, you can reach out and touch someone in the United States for 
$4 a minute; $3 to Europe. Their offices open early and close late. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first to provide this service was Patrick Smith, a Lebanese/British 
businessman and proprietor of Smith's supermarket, where West Beirut's 50 
American residents stop regularly each Saturday to shop and socialize. 
</P>
<P>
Some supermarkets have installed diesel-powered generators, and they offer 
their neighbors electricity for 10 hours a day for about $75 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The stores' shelves are not always full, but you can usually find adequate 
supplies of breakfast cereal -- Kellogg's, Post and General Mills -- Whiskas 
cat food, Paul Masson wines, frozen shrimp from the Persian Gulf and Danish 
bacon. 
</P>
<P>
You read and hear a great deal about the down-and-out Lebanese, but evidence of 
the Lebanese as survivor par excellence is everywhere in West Beirut. Beach 
clubs flourish; the private, 18-hole golf course is green and groomed. 
</P>
<P>
The latest Paris fashions are available at Kookai, which has branches on both 
sides of the city. The other day, Vivien Bayoud, a fashion-conscious, single 
businesswoman, was joking about the importance of wearing epaulets, as shoulder 
pads are called here. A friend had commented that they are too hot in summer, 
and Bayoud countered: "But we must look good for all those men from East 
Beirut." 
</P>
<P>
Some women, Bayoud apparently among them, have found a silver lining in the 
plight of East Beirut Christians who have sought safety in the western sector. 
</P>
<P>
Along Hamra Street you see women in epaulets picking their way among vendors 
and beggars en route to shops with names like Transparent Lingerie, Caviar, 
Groovy. 
</P>
<P>
A lottery-ticket vendor will bellow out over the roar of generators, "If you 
buy my tickets you will win 25 million Lebanese pounds ($38,000)." But this is 
qualified with a barely audible "inshallah" -- if God wills it. 
</P>
<P>
Pedestrian traffic bunches up at sidewalk displays, perhaps a bargain in 
Cartier watches at $6. Jeans, perfume, fresh fish -- all are available from 
hatchback vehicles parked along the way. 
</P>
<P>
To cross the street, it is best to wait in the shade for a break in the 
traffic. But not long ago a Syrian soldier carrying a rifle stepped out without 
even looking, certain that his uniform would get him safely to the other side. 
</P>
<P>
There was a squeal of tires, and a car grazed him. The car stood stock-still, 
as did the people around. No one would have changed places with the driver for 
all the lottery tickets in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The soldier peered in, saw a woman at the wheel, and delivered a heavy-booted 
kick that bent back the license plate. The driver had been saved by her gender. 
</P>
<P>
Stories like this are told and retold at cocktail parties. A good story is as 
welcome as a bottle of gin. But not as welcome as a bag of ice cubes. Many 
people have installed generators, but few have the capacity to keep a 
refrigerator going. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the water problem. The pumping station went out with the power. 
You can buy ice cubes at supermarkets, but the purity is questionable. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative water system was completed in March, and the water supply is 
fairly regular now, but the pressure doesn't get it above the ground floor. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if there is a problem in Beirut there is generally someone with a 
solution. For $10 an hour, a man with a pump will get water to the rooftop 
reservoir that is a fixture on most Beirut buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The movie houses have generators, too, and the marquees are advertising 
"Lambada -- the Forbidden Dance," "Revenge of Samson," "Raw Deal" and "Family 
Business." 
</P>
<P>
But the recently completed World Cup soccer tournament was the best show in 
town. When there was a game, the streets of Beirut were all but empty. People 
crowded around any convenient television set. 
</P>
<P>
At times, even a journalist is safe. Armed men at a checkpoint asked the blonde 
woman why she was carrying two bags. They could see cameras in one, notebooks 
and folders in the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you from?" they demanded to know. "What do you do?" 
</P>
<P>
Was this the time to take the friends' advice and lie? Impulsively, the truth 
popped out. 
</P>
<P>
They grinned and posed for a picture. 
</P>
<P>
"Allah maa'ik," they chorused. God be with you.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last month, the Pentagon quietly notified Congress that it planned to sell $4 
billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia. Included were more than 1,000 armored 
vehicles, 2,000 anti-tank rockets, 27 big-bore howitzers and upgrades for AWACS 
radar planes. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, any such sale would have provoked a raft of protests -- from 
Israel, from American Jewish groups and from staunchly pro-Israel members of 
Congress. Previous arms transfers -- even much smaller ones -- sparked banner 
headlines in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
But this year there was nothing but silence. 
</P>
<P>
Why is this sale different? 
</P>
<P>
Government and private analysts cite two subtle but important reasons: The 
weapons involved aren't as threatening to Israel, and U.S. lawmakers want to 
keep American weapons factories running to offset the decline in America's own 
defense orders. 
</P>
<P>
But to many, the absence of any protest also may reflect a more fundamental 
change -- a cooling in the diplomatic relations between Israel and the United 
States as a result of the hard-line stance by the new right-wing government of 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on dealing with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a change," said Michael Eisenstadt, military analyst at the 
Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "Israel may have diminished 
political stock in Washington, and the Israelis will be very selective how they 
spend it. They will be very careful in picking battles with regard to arms 
sales -- a lot more selective." 
</P>
<P>
Critics contend that there has been a distinctly anti-Israel tilt in Bush 
Administration statements and actions in recent months, reflecting growing 
White House impatience with the slow pace of the peace process and the seeming 
intransigence of the conservative Israeli government. 
</P>
<P>
They particularly cite Secretary of State James A. Baker III's taunt to Israel 
last month: "When you're serious about (peace), call us." To bolster his point, 
he publicly recited the White House telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the nature of the relationship with Israel has changed," concedes 
Rep. Larry Smith (D-Fla.), one of Israel's most vocal allies in Congress. "For 
the last six months or so, the U.S. has wrongly found it appropriate to engage 
in front-page public diplomacy, trying to scare them or blackmail them and 
openly courting Arab countries," Smith asserted. But he conceded that he is 
unlikely to stop the sale. 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), another strong pro-Israel voice in 
Congress, said the latest sale "hasn't reached the threshold of attention that 
a highly visible plane sale would reach now and similar sales have reached in 
the past." 
</P>
<P>
But he put President Bush on notice that Israel and its friends are not 
moribund -- merely keeping their powder dry in case the Administration proposes 
a sale of attack planes or other weapons that pose a more formidable threat to 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Administration and the Saudis want to view these sales as a dry 
run for an aircraft sale," Levine said. "That would be a grave mistake." 
</P>
<P>
An official of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee -- AIPAC -- the 
most influential pro-Israel lobby in the United States, said that it has not 
pulled out all the stops to oppose the sale because it believes the weaponry is 
not a direct threat to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's those sales that pose a threat to the stability in the region and 
Israel's security that were actively fought," the official said. "This one 
doesn't . . . fall into that category. Our concerns were raised . . . but the 
community is not likely to actively oppose the sale." 
</P>
<P>
Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, agrees. 
"The equipment itself is not offensive in nature, as some of the sales in the 
past have been," he said. "The climate in general is a little different, too. 
The Administration is concerned with trade deficits, it's concerned with jobs, 
and one weighs that against the danger to the security of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Foxman and others noted that because of the geography of the Mideast, armored 
personnel carriers in Saudi hands don't pose as serious a threat to Israel. 
Unlike long-range aircraft or missiles, the weapons in the latest sale are more 
likely to be used to counter a ground attack from one of Saudi Arabia's 
immediate neighbors rather than to invade Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also argued that the Saudis already have 155-millimeter 
howitzers and AWACS (airborne warning and control system) surveillance planes, 
so a few more guns and some more sophisticated equipment for the aircraft would 
not alter the military balance in the region appreciably. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, announcing the sale, said it will "contribute to the foreign 
policy and national security of the United States" and "will not affect the 
basic military balance in the region." The language was pure boilerplate, 
identical to that justifying other transfers. 
</P>
<P>
But officials privately reminded members of Congress that the sale -- along 
with last year's $3-billion sale of M1 tanks to Saudi Arabia -- comes at a 
critical time for the American weapons industry. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with near-certain cuts in Pentagon spending, Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney has threatened to close production lines -- particularly for big-ticket 
items like tanks and airplanes -- unless overseas buyers can be found. 
</P>
<P>
Foxman and Smith, the Florida congressman, say the current Saudi sale may mark 
the beginning of a trend -- an arms transfer that is justified in order to help 
bolster domestic employment and keep alive the so-called defense industrial 
base -- the factories, technology and workers engaged in arms production. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that's the case the Pentagon is making -- that we need these sales to 
keep production lines open in case the United States needs further access to 
these weapons," Smith said. "But I can see no justification beyond that of the 
U.S. weapons makers. We're turning these enormously dangerous weapons over to a 
country that doesn't have the people (trained) to use them." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokeswoman at the Israeli Embassy said Jerusalem's policy on arms 
sales to Saudi Arabia has not changed. "We remain opposed to arms sales to 
countries with whom we are at war and who have not recognized Israel's right to 
exist," she said.

Photo, Selling Arms to Saudis -- The United States began arms sales to Saudi 
Arabia after a Defense Department study on its military needs and to help 
develop closer ties with the larger oil supplier. Since 1980, the Saudis have 
contracted to buy $37 billion worth of U.S. weapons and related services. 
Purchases have included airborn warning and control system (AWACS), 
surveillance planes, (top), F-15 jet fighters, (middle), and M1 tanks (bottom). 
The most recent deal, worth $4 billion, includes more than 1,000 armored

Leaders of the 17-month-old Arab Maghreb Union will meet Saturday in Algiers to 
advance plans for a North African common market that would parallel the more 
unified European Community upcoming by the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Substantial progress is considered possible on an agreement to eliminate trade 
barriers and customs duties, allowing free circulation of goods among the five 
Maghreb countries -- Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. Also up 
for discussion, but still probably not ready for adoption, are similar 
proposals to eliminate travel restrictions for Maghreb citizens.

fundamentalists in Algeria will be high on the agenda. And the five are to 
decide whether to establish a permanent seat for the Arab Maghreb Union. Until 
now, the organization's headquarters has rotated along with the AMU 
chairmanship every six months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Background: 
</P>
<P>
Faced with severe economic troubles at home and potentially crippling cutbacks 
in their access to European markets, the five AMU countries agreed Feb. 17, 
1989, to set aside decades of political squabbling and competition in favor of 
greater economic cooperation. The hope: that unity would give them a stronger 
voice in dealing with Europe and that greater mutual trade among the member 
countries could make up for any European trade lost after 1992, the target date 
for Western Europe to institute a true common market. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim," King Hassan II of Morocco said, "is to turn the Arab Maghreb into 
one country, with one passport, one identity and a single currency." 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the five countries could hardly be less suited to development 
of a common market. Trade among them has averaged only about 3% of the region's 
total trade, while trade with Europe is over 60%. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the economies of the member countries often overlap. The olive oil 
that directly or indirectly supports 30% of Tunisia's farmers is also a big 
moneymaker for Morocco. The same is true, to a lesser extent, for those 
countries' citrus and phosphate exports. Algeria and Libya both rely heavily on 
their oil exports and petrochemical industries. Mauritania produces a lot of 
fish, but so does everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Although building intra-Maghreb trade is clearly not going to be easy, the five 
nations feel they have much to fear from European union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Threat: 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural-based economies like Morocco's and Tunisia's perhaps have the most 
to lose from Europe's rush toward 1992. Until now, their agricultural exports 
have flowed across the Mediterranean duty-free, but the inclusion of Greece, 
Portugal and Spain in the European Community -- countries that also have plenty 
of citrus, olives and wine to export -- has produced a lot of teeth-grinding on 
the southern Mediterranean rim. 
</P>
<P>
The Maghreb Studies Assn. in London estimates that Morocco's agricultural 
exports to Europe will be cut in half after 1992. Its wine production, the 
association declared, "will be almost all closed down." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, all the Maghreb countries have reason to worry about what effect the 
free flow of people across European borders will have on the 3 million workers 
now in Europe who are currently sending their paychecks home. 
</P>
<P>
Countries such as France, West Germany and Belgium are already making noises 
about tightening entry restrictions on North Africans, and an open border 
policy will likely mean other European countries will be encouraged to impose 
similar clampdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is they see this big monolith growing up on the other side of 
the Mediterranean, and they want to see if there's something they can do about 
it," said one analyst. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Europe's View: 
</P>
<P>
The European Community has been anxious to reassure the North Africans. "The 
fact that we are going to have one market and not 12 markets will definitely 
make things easier for them," said one European Community analyst posted in 
Algiers. "There is no doubt that the creation of this '92 market is going to be 
for them more of an opportunity than a problem." 
</P>
<P>
The European group recently negotiated an agreement allowing the Maghreb 
countries to maintain existing trade levels in products such as citrus even 
after 1992. A separate agreement on textiles allows countries such as Morocco 
and Tunisia to accelerate exports up to a certain level and leaves the door 
open for continued negotiations. But privately, many European leaders fear that 
if North Africa's economy does get worse, it will only mean more illegal 
immigration from the Maghreb. Accordingly, the European Community has proposed 
a 40% increase from the current $160 million in annual aid that it sends to 
North Africa -- an idea that is still far from winning consensus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Progress So Far: 
</P>
<P>
Since the union's initial meeting in 1989, AMU committees have been formed to 
study almost every conceivable facet of cooperation, and some headway has been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
In the discussion stage is construction of a Maghreb Highway from Libya to the 
Atlantic, establishment of a common airline (Air Maghreb) and funding of a 
common investment bank. Tentative accords have been signed exempting 
cross-border investors from double taxation. 
</P>
<P>
Algeria already has an operating pipeline transporting natural gas through 
Tunisia and on to Italy, and a second pipeline is in the works that would 
access Europe, across Gibraltar, through Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Complications: 
</P>
<P>
With the region's long history of cross-border squabbling, the Arab Maghreb 
Union faces political hurdles as well. 
</P>
<P>
A January summit was hampered by a new flare-up in the Western Sahara dispute 
that has kept Morocco and Algeria at odds for years. (Algeria supports the 
Polisario rebels who dispute Morocco's claim to the former Spanish colony.) 
Mauritania accuses Morocco of favoring rival Senegal in a bloody conflict 
between those countries. And Tunisia and Libya have a history of military 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Libya and its mercurial strongman, Col. Moammar Kadafi, have been a big 
question mark from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi, a vocal champion of Arab unity, insisted at first on an immediate and 
total merger joining all five Maghreb countries and four other African states. 
To accommodate him, the inaugural AMU text described the union as "only one 
essential stage on the way to the creation of Arab unity." 
</P>
<P>
But privately, leaders of the Maghreb countries believe that they have had a 
moderating influence on Kadafi. In any case, said one analyst, they feel more 
comfortable "having him inside the tent than outside the tent." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outlook: 
</P>
<P>
For all the barriers, Maghreb officials predict they will eventually make 
progress toward greater unity, if only because they have to. "Any country in 
the world cannot afford to live alone now," said Algerian diplomat Belkacem 
Madani. "The world has become very small, and that means the necessity of links 
between nations."

TOWARD A NEW KIND OF LATIN REVOLUTION: POWER TO THE MIDDLE CLASS; 
</P>
<P>
THE BUSH PLAN AIMS TO REVIVE LAGGARD ECONOMIES WITH INVESTMENT, TRADE AND DEBT 
RELIEF. THE WEALTHY OLIGARCHIES WOULD LOSE OUT IN THE PROCESS.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's new program offering Latin American countries unprecedented 
opportunities to expand trade ties with the United States, win help in reducing 
their debts and attracting foreign investment is meant to foment nothing less 
than a new revolution in the region. 
</P>
<P>
While he has not said so specifically, Bush wants to see power in Latin America 
wrested from the corrupt oligarchies that have dominated the region's economies 
for the past four decades and transferred to the long-fettered middle class, 
according to knowledgeable analysts. 
</P>
<P>
And the big question now is how aggressively the region's new democratic 
governments will respond. Initial reactions have been positive but slow in 
coming. Chile was the first to express interest in such a trade pact. 
</P>
<P>
The oligarchies, a legacy of the Spanish conquistadores, controlled their 
economies directly until the 1950s, when Argentine economist Raul Prebisch 
captured the region's fancy with a call for protection from imports, which was 
accompanied by a move to state ownership of private industry. 
</P>
<P>
When the region adopted Prebisch's policies, the government-owned enterprises 
became the major drain on national economies and provided a steady channel of 
income for the top economic classes, which obtained ownership shares and 
provided management skills. 
</P>
<P>
Today, state-run industries that in many cases benefit only a handful of 
wealthy families are subsidized by government borrowing and by taxes imposed on 
the relatively small populations of middle-class taxpayers. Latin economies are 
choking on the resulting debt. 
</P>
<P>
Alan J. Stoga, analyst for Kissinger Associates, former Secretary of State 
Henry A. Kissinger's New York consulting firm, argues that restructuring the 
Latin economies so they can operate on free-market principles is as central to 
any recovery in the hemisphere as it is to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no doubt that absent any restructuring of the Latin 
economies, there is nothing even worth talking about," Stoga said. "There will 
be no partnership at all." 
</P>
<P>
That is the rationale behind Bush's trade-rather-than-aid approach. The new 
democratic governments are strapped by debt and crippling inflation. If 
Washington can encourage them to abandon "Prebischism," it can weaken the 
oligarchies and boost the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, would help democracy take root, bolster American economic ties 
with the region and strengthen American security interests throughout the 
Southern Hemisphere, according to government and private strategists who 
specialize in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush's new proposals have attracted little attention, analysts say 
they constitute the most sweeping set of incentives since the "Alliance for 
Progress" program that John F. Kennedy proposed to help counter Fidel Castro's 
appeal in the 1960s. Here are the major points: 
</P>
<P>
* The United States will negotiate a bilateral free-trade agreement -- designed 
to cut tariffs and increase the flow of trade -- with any Latin country that is 
willing to undertake the kinds of reforms needed to shift to a market-oriented 
economic system. U.S. and Mexico already have begun preliminary work aimed at 
launching more formal trade talks later this year. 
</P>
<P>
* Washington will help set up a $300-million international lending pool to 
finance the infrastructure and technical aid needed to convert state-owned 
industries into private corporations and attract more foreign investment to the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
* Reversing its previous opposition, Washington would consider forgiving 
portions of the billions of dollars in debts that Latin countries owe the U.S. 
government -- a first step toward matching the writedowns that commercial banks 
have taken on their Latin loans. 
</P>
<P>
* And last week, Bush asked the annual seven-nation economic summit in Houston 
to launch a multibillion-dollar international effort to provide aid and 
technical help to Latin countries just as the Western nations have done for 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The series of rapid-fire proposals has come as a result of a rare personal 
involvement by the President, reflecting both his own longtime interest in the 
region and his belief that helping to bolster democracy there is important to 
U.S. national interests. 
</P>
<P>
Though born in Connecticut, Bush spent much of his early career in Texas, where 
-- as Commerce Secretary (and fellow Texan) Robert A. Mosbacher says -- "you 
learn a lot about the Mexican economy almost by osmosis." One of Bush's sons, 
Jeb, married a Mexican national. 
</P>
<P>
More important, Bush acquired a professional interest in Latin American during 
his years as director of the CIA and, later, as vice president -- an interest 
that continues today. 
</P>
<P>
Besides rushing out his new initiatives, Bush is scheduled to visit Brazil, 
Argentina and other Latin American countries in September. U.S. strategists say 
he has tentatively decided to take three more trips to the region over the next 
12 months. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there is no guarantee that Bush's new proposals will have a major 
impact. As Washington's cynics have pointed out, the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund have been pressuring the Latins for years to make 
needed reforms, without success. 
</P>
<P>
Just the same, by accident or not, Bush's new proposals come at a time when 
many of the region's new democratic governments are moving precisely in that 
direction -- and may be receptive to the promise of expanded markets abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico, under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has begun a sweeping reform 
of its economic and trade policies that virtually reverses four decades of 
corporate statism. Brazil just announced an even more dramatic overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has made some modest but important reforms. Argentina is just 
beginning. Costa Rica and many of the smaller Latin American countries are 
moving rapidly toward free-market economies. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the shift is being accelerated by a growing fear among Latin American 
governments that the increasing preoccupation of the Western powers with the 
emerging East European democracies will leave little or nothing in the aid pot 
for Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
It is just for that reason that Bush's own new program -- offering 
opportunities for expanded trade benefits and for an international aid effort 
-- virtually parallels the one that the allies have set up for the former 
Eastern Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the region's new governments are actively pondering the President's 
proposal, and it is hoped more will be ready to respond by the time Bush visits 
the area in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
But the real test will come after that, when -- if the Latins take Bush up on 
his plan -- the United States must make good on the President's offer. 
</P>
<P>
The Latins have made some progress before, noted Kissinger Associates' Stoga, 
but Washington has not always provided the rewards. 
</P>
<P>
If both sides come through and Washington forges a genuine partnership with the 
region, Stoga says, that could be a real revolution. If not, both sides will be 
disappointed -- again.

CRITICS LABEL LIBRARIES AS SHRINES BY THE PRESIDENTS, FOR THE PRESIDENTS

<P>
Carolyn Husbands was never keen on LBJ. But then she spent one sweltering 
afternoon here visiting the Lyndon Baines Johnson presidential library. 
</P>
<P>
From the moment she crossed the threshold of the gleaming white building 
perched on a grassy knoll at the edge of the University of Texas campus, 
Husbands sensed her old impressions beginning to erode. 
</P>
<P>
First there was the short biographical film on the late President's life, a 
heart-tugging presentation that had Husbands dabbing at tears. Then the 
resident of Jackson, Miss., strolled the museum corridors and gazed at the 
carefully preserved documents and artifacts chronicling Johnson's rise from 
poverty in the Texas Hill Country to the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she mounted a wide marble staircase to the "Great Hall," a lofty 
atrium featuring a glass wall exposing floor upon floor of bookshelves, each 
holding scarlet boxes with gold presidential seals packed with more than 35 
million letters, memos and other weighty documents of the Johnson 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
It was a bit overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel better about him after seeing all this," Husbands confided as she 
wandered through the library, soaking in the artfully crafted story of the 
nation's 36th President. "I know this accentuated the positive, but it changed 
my feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Accentuating the positive, it seems, is something presidential libraries do 
rather well. And now another is joining the fold. Along with the fanfare of the 
Richard M. Nixon presidential library grand opening comes criticism that the 
privately operated, $21-million complex in Yorba Linda will present a one-sided 
glorification of a President best known for his resignation in the midst of the 
Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's is not the first presidential library to suffer such barbs. From the 
Eastern Seaboard to the cornfields of Iowa, presidential libraries have long 
been under attack by those who see them as little more than shrines to the 
select few who have held the reins of power in America. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnson library has been dubbed a "Pharaoh's monument," while John F. 
Kennedy's library overlooking Dorchester Bay has been criticized for providing 
too much Camelot and not enough substance about that Administration's darker 
days. Some wags, meanwhile, note that Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower 
were so smitten by their respective libraries that both chose to be buried on 
the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
To fans, presidential libraries represent a fitting tribute to America's 
leaders, a lasting record of their lives and their administrations. 
</P>
<P>
But critics -- among them politicians and scholars of all stripes -- argue that 
the museum displays contained in the eight presidential libraries run by the 
the National Archives offer a glorified picture of their namesakes, a portrayal 
that robs visitors of a balanced perspective on history. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always true that there's a certain amount of distortion in the museums," 
said Stephen E. Ambrose, a political historian from the University of New 
Orleans and author of two volumes of biography on Nixon. "They always glorify 
the President. I'm sure (the Nixon library) won't be any exception." 
</P>
<P>
Even some partisans agree that a presidential library would be hard pressed to 
offer a portrait that is anything but celebratory. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an obvious tendency to think in shrinelike terms when you begin one of 
these," said Harry Middleton, director of the Johnson library and a former 
speech writer for Nixon's predecessor. "But that kind of thinking flattens 
after a while, and very likely the death of the President whose name adorns the 
building has something to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
From the day in 1939 that Franklin D. Roosevelt laid the cornerstone for his 
library in the Upstate New York community of Hyde Park, presidential libraries 
have been at the center of a tussle over their role as emblems of power in a 
democratic nation. 
</P>
<P>
Before Roosevelt, Presidents routinely removed their papers upon leaving 
office, and their preservation was largely a matter of luck. The bulk of George 
Washington's papers, for instance, were recovered by the government only after 
a relative sold them to the State Department between 1834 and 1849 for a 
then-lordly sum of $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
History suffered as the papers were cut up by autograph collectors, mutilated 
by rats, scattered about the countryside, burned in barns or carted off by 
marauding troops. The single exception was Rutherford B. Hayes, for whom a 
museum and archives were established in Ohio to preserve his presidential 
papers and celebrate his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
After the turn of the century, several Presidents began depositing their papers 
in the Library of Congress. But it was not until Roosevelt that the concept of 
a presidential library run by the National Archives sprang to life. In 1955, 
Congress passed the Presidential Libraries Act to allow other Presidents to 
follow Roosevelt's example. 
</P>
<P>
Each one did just that, but not without difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy library was originally planned for a parcel in Cambridge beside 
Harvard University, but opposition from nearby homeowners resulted in the 
complex being delayed for more than a decade. It was ultimately built up the 
road at a shoreline site on the University of Massachusetts campus. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Carter's library was beset with complaints from homeowners over an 
expressway that would have cut through a leafy, well-to-do section of Atlanta. 
A proposal for a Ronald Reagan library at Stanford University was scuttled 
chiefly by student and faculty opposition, and the complex now is being built 
in a rural tract in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The initial reaction in West Branch, Iowa, to plans for the Hoover library was 
that the institution would be an intrusion on the community, recalled John 
Fawcett, the National Archive's assistant archivist for presidential libraries 
and a native of the tiny farm community. Residents were concerned the library 
would remove valuable land from the tax base and prompt authorities to plow a 
four-lane road through town, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Interestingly enough, now the Hoover library is seen as the greatest asset in 
West Branch," Fawcett said. "There's been a total turnaround in how the 
community feels. They're even trying to resurrect the old four-lane road plans 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the libraries are often seen as an economic and cultural boon by many 
townsfolk. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnson library, for instance, is second only to the Alamo as a Texas 
tourist attraction, its operators boast. Similar benefits are also reaped in 
Independence, Mo., site of the Truman presidential library. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real important aspect of Independence life over the last 25 or 30 
years," said Barbara J. Potts, the city's longtime former mayor. "Independence 
is proud of the Truman legacy. He put us on the map." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the detractors. 
</P>
<P>
Foes of the libraries have warred with supporters over a broad slate of issues, 
from how much space should be allowed for the museums to whether it would be 
better to gather all the presidential papers in one place, such as Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Such gripes prompted Congress in 1986 to adopt legislation that provides 
incentives to limit the size of future libraries to 70,000 square feet (the 
Johnson library sprawls over about 100,000 square feet) and ensures that each 
opens only after a hefty private endowment is established to defray operating 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnson library, for instance, has an endowment of $20 million, and the 
promoters of the Nixon complex want to raise at least $10 million. Both 
Presidents helped out by donating money collected from sales of books they 
published. 
</P>
<P>
Others have sought money from friends and the public. 
</P>
<P>
Truman raised revenue by hitting "the rubber chicken circuit," speaking before 
countless fund-raisers, said George H. Curtis, assistant library director in 
Independence. (Truman was also noted for spending more time at his library than 
any other President. He kept regular office hours and even took to leading 
packs of schoolchildren on tours.) 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, criticism has even mounted against some of the museum 
displays. Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), a prominent anti-war 
activist during the Vietnam era, has blasted the Johnson library's exhibit on 
the war, charging that it stretches the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Sidey, a Time magazine correspondent who has covered every President since 
Eisenhower, noted that the 20-minute biographical film at the Johnson library 
lavishes attention on "Great Society" programs, but spends only two minutes on 
Vietnam, which he calls "the single most dominant event in the Johnson 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Sidey also suggested that Kennedy's museum falls short of conveying the "grim 
moments" of 1961, when the Administration suffered "a bunch of hammer blows all 
year long" with events such as the Bay of Pigs, the orbital flight of Soviet 
cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin and the rise of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Kennedy) museum is much more glamorized than 1961 really was," Sidey 
said. "It was really kind of grim. These were young guys not sure what they 
were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such criticisms, Sidey sees an important role for presidential 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an element of enshrining, but that's not so bad really," said Sidey, 
who counts himself a supporter of the presidential library system. "Maybe it's 
a President's rebuttal. Maybe these guys who take the slings and arrows, who 
are so pummeled in public, should have their chance."

Ultimately, it is the presidential archives, the vast repositories of 
correspondence, memos and other documents, that are the soul of the 
presidential library system, argues Fawcett of the National Archives. While a 
presidential museum may offer one perspective of an administration, the 
archival records gleaned by a scholar may yield a decidedly different picture. 
</P>
<P>
Lyndon Johnson dedicated his library by declaring that he wanted it to present 
"the story of our time -- with the bark off." While some critics may question 
how well the museum has fulfilled that mission, the archives seem almost beyond 
reproach. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most vivid proof is the publication of Robert A. Caro's 
controversial volumes of biography on Johnson, works that were drawn in part 
from documents culled from the dimly lit stacks of the Johnson library in 
Austin. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Nixon library, it will largely be the public that decides its 
success or failure, Fawcett said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nixon presidency is a particularly difficult one to portray," he said. 
"There were significant foreign policy advancements, major domestic triumphs, 
yet through Watergate some of the most tragic developments of any presidential 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
"It has the potential of being a very good exhibit on a very important part of 
history. But that is not for me to judge. It's for the people who visit -- the 
people of hometown U.S.A., the architecture critics, the political critics, the 
newspaper columnists. That's how a museum is judged."

ORANGE COUNTY? WE'RE TALKING GOP TERRITORY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE NIXON LIBRARY IS ANOTHER BADGE ON THE CHEST OF THIS BASTION OF 
CONSERVATISM AND WILL BE WORN PROUDLY.

YORBA LINDA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County isn't known for its cuisine or its architecture or even a crop, 
like Iowa's corn. No, to the rest of the nation, Orange County is famous for 
its politics. 
</P>
<P>
This is the place where a Republican politician is treated like the returning 
war hero in a John Wayne movie and a Democrat, almost like the faceless enemy. 
But then, there aren't many elected Democrats and none ranked higher than 
small-town mayor. 
</P>
<P>
So when Richard M. Nixon decided to build his presidential library in Yorba 
Linda, it was received by an enthusiastic and almost blushing audience. The 
nation's most controversial living President faced protests at other possible 
locations, but in Orange County the host was genuinely honored. 
</P>
<P>
It is another badge on the conservative Orange County chest, and it will be 
worn with all the gusto of a distinguished champion. If Nixon is a hero 
anywhere, it is here. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an occasion that absolutely brings tears of joy to my eyes because 
Richard Nixon is finally being given the credit and acknowledgement that he 
deserves," said Orange County Republican Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes, who 
greeted Nixon in 1974 when he arrived from Washington at the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station one day after his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"The library will forever be a special presence of him in the community that 
loves him and always has loved him and wishes him well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most vivid demonstration of Orange County's unflinching support for 
Nixon came in a scene from his darkest hour. When Nixon resigned, some parts of 
the nation celebrated and in some parts, there was relief. But in Orange 
County, an emotional and sympathetic crowd of nearly 5,000 people crowded the 
El Toro base when Air Force One touched down with Nixon and his family on Aug. 
9, 1974 -- their first day as private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Many waited two hours on that hot summer afternoon, and when Nixon and his 
wife, Pat, stepped from the aircraft onto the red-carpeted stairway, they 
chanted: "We want Nixon! We want Nixon!" 
</P>
<P>
Some cried. Others waved American flags. And some carried posters with the 
slogan from his 1972 reelection campaign: "President Nixon, Now More Than 
Ever." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon recalled the scene in his latest book, "In the Arena," as an emotionally 
difficult one for him. During the brief stop, he hesitated before stepping to a 
microphone where he told the cheering Orange County crowd: "We are home again." 
</P>
<P>
As the helicopter rotors cranked up for the short ride to San Clemente, the 
crowd began singing -- softly at first -- "God Bless America." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported the following day: "It was the first time Mr. Nixon had 
faced the public since his Watergate crisis had worsened in the last few weeks. 
He picked a friendly place, Orange County, where he lives and was born, an area 
that faithfully falls into the Republican column on Election Day." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is a place where people seem to like their lives and want them to 
stay that way. In a poll by The Times last year, an astonishing 96% of the 
people said they were happy and one-third went so far as to say "Living in 
Orange County is the closest thing to paradise in America today." 
</P>
<P>
Translated into politics, it is a community that resists change. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Republicanism is anti-communist, free enterprise and small 
government. It is heavily influenced by the libertarian philosophy integral to 
its history. And it is home to some of the nation's most conservative 
politicians -- namely U.S. Reps. Robert K. Dornan and William E. Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, both have controversial reputations, but they both have enjoyed 
solid support in their districts. It's one of Orange County's many 
nowhere-but-here political stories. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 elections, conservative hero Oliver L. North, who was later 
convicted of crimes involving the Iran-Contra scandal, campaigned for two 
Orange County congressional candidates, both of whom won in crowded fields of 
Republican opponents. 
</P>
<P>
And Nixon himself, who has hardly made any campaign appearances since leaving 
Washington, traveled to Orange County for a $1,000-per-plate fund-raiser on 
behalf of Bruce Herschensohn's 1986 Senate bid. 
</P>
<P>
This comfortable Republican turf is also where a high-flying Ronald Reagan 
kicked off his 1984 reelection campaign. And on the final day of California's 
closely fought 1986 Senate race, Republican candidate Ed Zschau made his last 
stand at an outdoor Orange County rally headlined by Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Consider some other evidence of the county's GOP muscle: 
</P>
<P>
Basically, GOP candidates look to Orange County for their victory margins in 
statewide races. Orange County is the Republican counterweight to Democratic 
San Francisco. There is a general rule of thumb among political strategists 
that a Republican candidate who wins in Orange County by more than 270,000 
votes will be virtually unbeatable statewide and a GOP candidate who loses 
Orange County cannot win in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County has become the Republican fulcrum in California," said Ken 
Khachigian, a nationally known GOP speech writer and consultant from San 
Clemente. "As a Republican strategist, I automatically view what margin I want 
to take out of Orange County as my potential victory margin statewide. It's the 
base, it's where we start." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans have a virtual monopoly on elected power in Orange County. They 
essentially represent all of the county's state and federal districts. All five 
county supervisors are Republican. And of the county's 150 city council 
members, 117 are Republican. There are also 29 mayors in Orange County and only 
three are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
As demonstrated in this year's June primary, the county is also an exporter of 
its political influence. Of the 12 Republican candidates running for statewide 
office in the primary, half lived in Orange County or represented it while in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Orange County rich in Republican votes, it is also rich in dollars. 
The county Republican committee is the largest and wealthiest in the state, 
with a paid staff of about 18 who conduct a year-round fund-raising and voter 
registration effort. The committee spent more than $600,000 during the 1988 
election and its most prestigious affiliate -- the Lincoln Club -- added 
another $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lamenting the lopsided politics, a delegate to the county Democratic Party 
Central Committee said at a recent meeting: "In Los Angeles, I knew what it was 
like to be discriminated against as a woman and a Hispanic. Now I know what it 
is like to be discriminated against as a Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there are nearly 400,000 registered Democrats in Orange 
County, the party's second-largest pocket of voters in the state. So it does 
draw attention from statewide candidates such as the party's gubernatorial 
nominee, Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
But there are more than 600,000 registered Republicans. The GOP has an edge in 
registered voters of about 55% to 35% -- its strongest ratio in California. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Hewitt, executive director of the Nixon library foundation, says it is a 
"happy accident" that the library ended up on friendly Republican soil. It 
wasn't a requirement, he said, but it was a welcome factor.

'BUSH ON BOARD' MAY MEAN MISERY ON I-5

President Bush's motorcade is scheduled to travel through some of Orange 
County's most traffic-clogged streets at rush hour Wednesday evening as he is 
whisked between El Toro and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's schedule calls for him to travel by car between the El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station and his overnight quarters at the Anaheim Hilton between 5:50 and 
6:10 p.m. He will be in Orange County to attend the dedication of the Richard 
M. Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that the motorcade might use the always-clogged Santa Ana 
Freeway dismayed traffic observers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just poor planning on somebody's part," said KNX Radio's traffic 
reporter, Dona Dower. "That's just going to make the Santa Ana Freeway 
miserable." 
</P>
<P>
Even on a normal day, Dower said the traffic on that section of freeway is 
"generally heavy -- you're talking an average of about 30 miles per hour." 
</P>
<P>
White House officials would not reveal the exact route Bush will take, but it 
would appear most likely to be northbound on the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Police, Caltrans, U.S. Secret Service and California Highway Patrol officials 
also declined to elaborate on the traffic plans. They would not say whether 
accommodations would be made to ease the problems or how commuters might avoid 
snarls. They said they were unable to comment because the information was not 
available and that it might jeopardize security. 
</P>
<P>
But a White House official, who asked not to be identified, said the impact 
would be minimal because the motorcade will travel against the heaviest flow of 
traffic. He also said the route is routinely driven by a presidential advance 
team before the schedule is released. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, when the president's motorcade travels on a freeway, the route is 
sealed off by CHP officers several miles ahead and behind the limousines. 
</P>
<P>
In a leap-frog style procession, CHP motorcycles rush in front of the motorcade 
and block the on-ramps until the president has passed. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is scheduled to leave Orange County about 1 p.m. on Thursday, just after 
the morning dedication at the library. Former Presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan 
will also attend the dedication, but their travel plans have not yet been 
released.

DEMOCRATS HAVE THE MEMORY OF AN ELEPHANT WHEN IT COMES TO NIXON

The pomp and celebration of the Nixon library opening may be engulfing Orange 
County this week, but for folks like Jane Gerber it's all a big pain in the 
craw. 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong Democrat, Gerber voted against Nixon in his tumultuous Senate 
election battle against Helen Gahagan Douglas back in 1950. She voted against 
him when he ran for governor in 1962, and in every presidential race before and 
after. 
</P>
<P>
So it's hardly surprising that the Westminster woman finds it particularly 
galling to see a $21-million library opening for the politician she loved to 
loath. 
</P>
<P>
"I am just appalled at how quickly people can forget the bad things that 
happened -- Watergate, the Vietnam War, all of it," said Gerber, 72. "I just 
don't understand how we can build a shrine to that type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
She is not alone. Nixon supporters of all stripes may see Thursday's grand 
opening as the resurrection of a defrocked President, but for the Nixon haters 
of the nation, the event represents a flash point igniting memories of 
political shenanigans past. 
</P>
<P>
Even in conservative Orange County, the feelings run deep among Democrats and 
liberals who consider Nixon more of a crook than elder statesman. They grumble 
and groan, they roll their eyes. Most plan to try and ignore the hoopla, hoping 
that it all will just go away. 
</P>
<P>
"The library dedication is an embarrassment," said Marion Pack, executive 
director of the Alliance for Survival in Orange County, an activist group. "I 
would liken it to a boil on the skin. The last thing you want to do is draw 
attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
But others welcome the celebration, which will feature all four living 
Republican Presidents, as a perfect opportunity for a little demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
A cavalcade of protesters from across the Southland -- among them peace 
activists, gay rights advocates and environmentalists -- are expected to picket 
the ceremonies to mark the library opening. Upward of 300 may show, organizers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Many people say they will attend in an effort to make an impression on the 
current resident of the Oval Office, George Bush, not to blast a President who 
resigned nearly two decades ago under a cloud of scandal. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard M. Nixon has always inspired the passion of protesters, and that 
old magic hasn't waned, even as a civilian. 
</P>
<P>
"My motivation to be there is to protest Nixon," said Tim Carpenter, co-founder 
of Peace Politics, an Orange County-based band of activists. "The library is 
embarrassing. Orange County is being saddled with another conservative icon. . 
. . We need to show people that not all is quiet on the western front, that 
even behind the Orange Curtain there are people in opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many Democratic politicians admit to feeling an uneasy sense of 
irritation as the day draws near for the library opening. 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel the man is a shyster and a crook," said Rep. George E. Brown Jr. 
(D-Colton) who crossed swords with Nixon on numerous occasions during the 
Vietnam War. "But American history will take care of that in due course." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the library opening is "a commentary on the nature of American 
politics," demonstrating the nation's unerring ability to forgive even the 
gravest political sins. 
</P>
<P>
"Nixon probably helped to degrade the quality of American politics more than 
any other American politician," Brown said. "If I thought about it a long time 
I'd probably get nauseated, but I'm not going to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Some local Democrats contend it is less the library and more the imperial 
celebration surrounding its opening that has proved vexing of late. 
</P>
<P>
"A little more humility by everyone involved would be nice, instead of all this 
pandering and looking at Nixon as a great President, which is ludicrous," said 
John Hanna, an attorney and former chairman of the Orange County Democratic 
Party in the late 1980s. "You've got to give credit where credit is due, but 
certainly in any examination of the Nixon presidency the overwhelming thing one 
has to come away with is the fact that he's the only President in our history 
who resigned in disgrace under the threat of impeachment." 
</P>
<P>
As for the library itself, Hanna figures it will fit the Orange County 
landscape like Cinderella's slipper, establishing a spot on the tourist maps as 
a Disneyland for political junkies. 
</P>
<P>
"I live here in a Republican sea as it is," Hanna noted. "It seems to fit that 
Nixon's library is here in this fantasy land, where most of our partisan 
officials seem to think we live in a different century." 
</P>
<P>
Richard O'Neil, a prominent Orange County developer and former state and county 
Democratic Party chairman, said that in the hearts and minds of conservative 
Orange County voters, Nixon has never really left. 
</P>
<P>
"He never really was out of it here," O'Neil said. "This isn't a resurrection 
for him really. It's just the same old thing. They see him as kind of a 
hometown person. There's no doubt he had an awful lot of friends here in Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
And a lot of enemies. 
</P>

"Richard Nixon reminds me of one of those blowup punching bags that has sand in 
the bottom -- you give it a whop and it keeps coming back," said Sherry 
Meddick, president of a group trying to ease the effects of development in 
Orange County. "We all lived through the Nixon years. I can't see any reason to 
go back and do it again at the library. I'm quite sure I won't go visit it."

PLANNING COMMISSION VOTE APPARENTLY PAVED WAY FOR SUBDIVISION 
</P>

A 1985 vote by Orange County's chief planning body apparently paved the way for 
construction of more than 100 homes in an area that had been set aside as 
future parkland, according to documents released by the county Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission vote on Nov. 19, 1985, conditionally approved a 
development plan submitted by Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd., which had 
recently bought the Laguna Niguel property from another developer. Although 
previous documents had set aside the 99 acres for parkland, maps accompanying 
the 1985 plan showed houses on a large portion of that land. Instead of 
becoming a park, the property ended up as a subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like somebody wasn't alert when this went through the planning 
process," Planning Commission member Thomas Moody said after being told of the 
documents. "I would have expected that it would have been caught by staff." 
</P>
<P>
The documents, released Monday in a briefing for reporters and an investigator 
from the Orange County district attorney's office, shed new light on a 1988 
land transaction that has raised questions of criminal wrongdoing and drawn 
heavy fire from area environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
The documents strengthen the contention that the county staff may have ineptly 
managed the parcel that had been deeded to it for parks. But serious questions 
also remain about the actions of James F. Krembas, a Laguna Niguel city 
councilman who, while serving as vice president of the Laguna Niguel Community 
Services District, deeded away the public's right to the property. Krembas 
signed over the property to Taylor Woodrow on Feb. 12, 1988. Three months later 
his wife, Jeanette Krembas, was hired by the company. James Krembas is under 
investigation by the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The county's role is not thought to be the focus of the district attorney's 
inquiry, but it too has come under fire for its handling of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Moody, who introduced the motion for conditional approval of the development, 
nevertheless said that maps detailing the proposed development should have been 
screened by the county staff to ensure that the development did not infringe on 
an area reserved as open space. Although the records are incomplete, the 
motion, which passed unanimously, appears in effect to have changed the 
property's status from open space to residential. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow Homes President Gordon Tippell, who denies any wrongdoing either 
by the company or by Krembas, said he was contacted by the district attorney's 
office Monday and plans to meet with investigators today. 
</P>
<P>
"We have absolutely nothing to hide," Tippell said. "We're willing to meet with 
anyone to talk about this and to clear this up." 
</P>
<P>
Tippell added that he was unaware of any zoning change for the property and 
that he believes it had remained unchanged since at least the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, records show that the formal zoning designation for the 99 acres has 
long been "planned community" but that the use envisioned for the property had 
changed over time. An environmental impact report that included the area in 
question was prepared in March, 1981, and maps accompanying that report show 
the 99 acres reserved as open space. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow, in fact, appears to have concurred. Records filed with the 
county on July 19, 1985, bear Tippell's signature on a document accompanying a 
map that restates an earlier commitment by another developer to dedicate the 
property as open space. The county had never formally accepted the deal, 
instead passing over the offer to the Laguna Niguel Community Services 
District. 
</P>
<P>
By October of 1985, maps on file with the county showed plans for houses on a 
large section of the open space area. Then in February of 1988, Krembas, acting 
for the district board but without having consulted the other members, deeded 
the property to Taylor Woodrow, giving up the public's right to the land. 
</P>
<P>
One hundred homes now cover that hillside, and foundations have been laid for 
77 more. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that you cannot, I cannot, dispose of parkland and allow 
houses to be built on it without the proper actions being taken," said Laguna 
Niguel Mayor Patricia C. Bates. "We'll be looking into that."

HEAT WAVE WARMS THE OCEAN WATERS; 
</P>
<P>
CLIMATE: HOW HOT IS IT? WELL, IT'S BEEN SO HOT THAT THE PACIFIC IS CONSIDERABLY 
WARMER, OFFICIALS SAY. BUT YOU WON'T HEAR ANY COMPLAINTS FROM BEACH-GOERS. 
</P>

<P>
While the heat wave turns us into limp, damp creatures that crawl between work 
and home, it is also doing something a little less predictable: It is warming 
up the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards say the past week's persistent record-breaking heat has boosted sea 
temperatures off the county coast into the middle and high 70s, in some places 
more than 10 degrees above normal. Oceanographers and meteorologists said the 
warm currents may be coming from off the Baja California coast, where there is 
hot, humid tropical weather associated with a hurricane and a tropical storm. 
</P>
<P>
The enticingly warm waters are a treat for those fortunate enough to escape to 
the beaches, but they bring extra work for lifeguards, who must be even more 
vigilant in monitoring the big crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Surface water temperatures are as high as 79 degrees, a mark recorded Saturday 
by a city lifeguard boat about 100 yards off Corona del Mar State Beach. Even 
temperatures well below the surface, where the water is generally cooler, are 
in the mid-70s, lifeguards said. 
</P>
<P>
Clinton Winant, director of the Center for Coastal Studies at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, said temperatures normally hover 
around 68 degrees at the water's surface this time of year, and they slide to 
about 60 degrees at depths of about 15 feet. That is what made Winant term 
"amazing" the last couple of days' readings of 73 to 76 off the Newport Beach 
pier at a depth of about 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rare that the warmth can penetrate that deep into the water," Winant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Logan Lockabey, a supervisor with U.S. Ocean Safety, a private firm that 
contracts with Orange County to provide lifeguard services on county beaches, 
said temperatures at the three-foot-deep level, about 100 yards offshore, rose 
to 72 and 73 degrees last week and pushed up to 76 degrees at beaches in South 
Laguna, Capistrano and Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon C. Reed, a marine safety officer with Newport Beach's lifeguards, said 
the water temperatures remind him of the El Nino weather pattern that heated 
ocean waters in 1983, when the sea produced mercury readings of 70 to 75 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of those same things happening now," he said. "Warm water 
temperatures, heat, humidity, thunderstorms." 
</P>
<P>
But Winant cautioned that it is too early to pin the abnormally high water 
temperatures on a "long-term phenomenon" such as El Nino. He said he suspects 
that a hurricane off the coast of Baja California, and another tropical weather 
system in the same area, are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Southerly winds produced by those weather systems can account for the warming 
of the waters, Winant said. When the wind blows toward the north over the 
ocean, he said, it drags the top layer of the water with it and pushes it onto 
the coast. The result is that the uppermost, warmest layer of water piles up on 
the shore. 
</P>
<P>
Rea Strange, a private oceanography and meteorology consultant in Montecito, 
believes that the water temperature changes are the result of the Davidson 
effect, a pattern of warm currents making inroads north from Baja. That would 
also account for the tropical storm activity in that area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. John Blauer of the Newport Beach Marine Safety Department said the 
combination of searing temperatures, few night and morning clouds and only 
faint winds has allowed the sun to bake the still water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like leaving a glass of water on your roof," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But those on the beaches seemed to be enjoying it. 
</P>
<P>
"The water is very nice, very pleasant," Reed said. "People don't have a bit of 
hesitation before going in." 
</P>
<P>
Lockabey, in Laguna, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people sit around the beach and don't go in when the water's colder," 
he said. "But now everyone's in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

1. Southerly winds blow over the ocean, dragging the top layer of water with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
2. As the winds push the water north, the uppermost, warmest layer of water 
piles up on shore.

A man who was arrested on suspicion of public drunkenness died in a Police 
Department holding cell when he apparently suffocated on his own vomit, police 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Nasr Mohamed, 42, of Garden Grove, was pronounced dead at 10:15 p.m. Sunday by 
paramedics, Sgt. Steve Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
He had been arrested earlier in the evening at a supermarket parking lot at the 
corner of Euclid Street and Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Mohamed died as he lay on a cot with his back to a video camera that monitors 
activities inside the police station's three holding cells, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any movement by the prisoner whatsoever, you can see," Police Sgt. Dale Farley 
said. But, "if he is laying down with his back toward the camera, naturally you 
can't see any facial movement." 
</P>
<P>
Mohamed's body was discovered by the night watch commander while he was making 
a routine check of the cells. The holding cells are inspected every 15 minutes, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was performed Monday morning by the Orange County coroner's office, 
but the exact cause of death is not expected to be released for about 16 weeks, 
according to William King, coroner's investigating supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Although autopsy results were not immediately available, police said that 
evidence suggested that Mohamed died when he began vomiting and was unable to 
wake up fully. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief John Robertson said Mohamed was the first person to die in custody 
at the police station in about 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating the death, 
Sanders said.JAMES M. GOMEZ

USERS OVERWHELM TOXIC WASTE CENTER 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new drop-off site for household hazardous materials -- the first of its kind 
in the county -- has attracted so many people since opening on July 5 that it 
has had to close early and turn residents away. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, ready to open the site again this morning, are asking 
residents not to storm the place and to observe state law that allows 
individuals to carry a maximum of five gallons or 50 pounds of toxics at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been holding materials for so long they're bringing truckloads," 
said Jaimy Gentry, assistant coordinator for the Orange County Fire 
Department's Household Hazardous Materials Collection Project. "But they've had 
it in their garage for 10 years -- two more weeks isn't going to hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Hours of the center are 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. today through Thursday and 9 a.m. to 3 
p.m. Saturday. But the doors have been closed at least one hour early every day 
since the site opened. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 cars daily have passed through the center, delivering household 
toxics such as paint, insecticides and motor oil. Most people were carrying 
more than the limit, causing a number of cars to be turned away. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry noted that on Saturday lines were especially long -- some residents 
waiting up to an hour -- and encouraged people to wait until the rush dies down 
to bring in their toxic trash. 
</P>
<P>
Until the center opened, county residents had no permanent site for legally 
disposing of household toxics. 
</P>
<P>
The county, which funds the Anaheim operation, plans to set up five other 
permanent sites by the end of the year, in Huntington Beach, Stanton, San Juan 
Capistrano, Brea and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim center, at 2761 E. White Star Ave., accepts only household toxics. 
The waste is trucked out of the county to be either recycled, treated or taken 
to landfills. LISA MASCARO

<P>
Hoping to underscore its desire to keep businesses in the community, the City 
Council has approved the new full-time staff position of community development 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved the establishment of an ad hoc Business Advisory 
Committee, in which members of the Chamber of Commerce, the business community, 
a planning commissioner and residents at large will look into ways to retain 
businesses in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"(The committee) will be looking into what the city can do to promote a healthy 
business climate," City Manager Robert C. Dunek said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, several businesses have moved out of Los Alamitos, Dunek 
said. The losses resulted in a noticeable dip in sales tax revenue, and the 
city set out to find out why businesses were leaving. 
</P>
<P>
The analyst position carries with it a salary range of $2,541 to $3,120 a 
month. The appointee will be responsible for code enforcement activities, the 
community development block grant program and working to revitalize the 
business community. 
</P>
<P>
The ad hoc committee will report back to the council at its budget review 
session in January. The committee might then become an on-going liaison between 
the city staff and businesses, Dunek said.KATHIE BOZANICH

PEOPLE: LIBRARIAN DANCES HER WAY TO OTHER CULTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Debbie Webb took a folk dancing class in college, and it changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
She has become a world traveler and performs in folk dance festivals throughout 
Eastern and Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said it's the only way she and her husband, Michael Webb, 36, can find 
places to dance. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still some folk dancing spots in Los Angeles, but the boom time of 
folk dancing in the '70s and '80s is over," said Webb, 38, a librarian at 
Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, you could dance every night of the week if you wanted to," she 
added, noting that folk dancing is not big in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
During the '70s, she continued, "people weren't so much into the 'me 
generation.' Seems like people today are more interested in other things and 
not doing the dance thing as a social outlet." 
</P>
<P>
For Webb, folk dancing is a way to better understand people of the world. "When 
you gather for folk dancing, you understand different cultures better, even if 
you can't speak the language," said Webb. 
</P>
<P>
She is recovering from a knee operation she hopes will put her in "world class 
shape" for the August, 1991, Bulgarian Folk Dance Festival, which is only held 
every five years. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go to a country, people have been very accepting, especially in Turkey 
and Bulgaria," said Webb, who is in charge of periodicals for the college 
library. Her husband is a psychiatric social worker. 
</P>
<P>
She said people in those countries "deem it an honor that we know their dances 
and are interested enough to come to their country and seek it out." When they 
travel, the couple attempt to find not only dance, but its music. "We ask the 
locals where we can find it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
They also look for costumes, since there are few outlets in the United States 
for authentic folk dance costumes, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"When we do find them in America, the cost is very high," she noted. "We buy 
most of our costumes in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Folk dancing is a lifetime commitment for the Webbs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good way to meet people with the same interests, and we do learn 
so much about other people when we experience their dance and music," she said. 
</P>
<P>
They made their first international folk dancing trip in the late 1970s, when 
they backpacked their equipment and camped out. 
</P>
<P>
"We hunted up the best dancing spots we could find," she said. "There's a 
strong folk tradition in Ireland, and we ended up dancing every night." 
</P>
<P>
The following year they danced in festivals in England and Scotland and later 
danced in Bulgaria, taking part in the famous Koprivschtitsa Festival in the 
little mountain town of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge event in Bulgaria. They close the country down for one week," she 
said. "Peasants come from all over to participate." 
</P>
<P>
Webb said they became celebrities of sorts since few Americans go to Bulgaria 
to folk dance. While they enjoyed dancing in Bulgaria, the Webbs, who live in 
Los Angeles, also found happiness two years ago dancing in Turkey during a 
four-week vacation there. 
</P>
<P>
They took part in a three-day folk dance festival in the small Black Sea 
fishing village of Arhavi. 
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish people were wonderful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although they continue to travel, the Webbs still folk dance every Tuesday 
night at Cal Tech in Pasadena. They have been dancing there since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
But Debbie has other talents. She has studied Japanese classical dance and is a 
belly-dancer. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Fullerton College track and field coach Jim Kiefer is in Calcutta until 
Aug. 5 coaching coaches there on the latest techniques in field events. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been tremendous cultural, educational and technological changes in 
sports in the past few years," said the Yorba Linda resident, who was recruited 
for the assignment by the Indo-USA Commission. "We will not only show the 
latest techniques in coaching, but also what is being done administratively and 
technically to keep on top of things."

Jim Swift, a hiker who survived a lightning storm on Mt. Whitney that claimed 
the life of his roommate, remembered coming down the mountain saying, "I'm 
never coming back here again." 
</P>
<P>
But by Monday, two days after Matthew E. Nordbrock, 26, was killed, he had had 
a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
"A good friend of Matt's came over (Sunday) night and he said to me, 'You know, 
I'm going to have to go up there and see that place. I want to see the place 
where Matt last was.' " 
</P>
<P>
Swift agreed to go along. "We're going to do it as a memorial climb," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nordbrock died Saturday at the summit of Mt. Whitney in an old stone hut with a 
corrugated metal roof, which acted as a lightning rod. 
</P>
<P>
Swift said he, Nordbrock and two other friends had noticed a severe change in 
weather when they reached the summit. 
</P>
<P>
"All the way up, the sky was blue with hardly any clouds. Then about 2:23 p.m. 
we reached the top and the clouds started rolling in five minutes later. The 
wind picked up and the skies grew darker," Swift said. 
</P>
<P>
The air became electrically charged, Swift said. "Matt noticed it and said, 
'Did you feel that?' I felt this little shock on my feet. At the same time, 
Kent (Kroener) looked at me and said, 'Oh, man! I feel my hair. I can feel it 
going up,' from static electricity," Swift said. 
</P>
<P>
The four made a run for the old hut, where they encountered nine other hikers 
who had taken refuge from the storm. Within 30 seconds it started to rain, and 
hail pelted the metal roof. 
</P>
<P>
"Then out of absolutely nowhere this lightning entered the structure," Swift 
said. "It was like a lightning ball, not a jolt. It was popping and crackling 
and I thought to myself, 'What is this thing?' " 
</P>
<P>
The hut's floors and walls became electrified, immobilizing those inside. The 
tremendous flash left everyone inside the hut with first- and second-degree 
burns. Swift said his feet "felt glued" to the floor. Later, he learned that 
part of the electrical energy had entered the back of his right leg, run down 
both legs and came out through his feet, burning holes in the bottoms of his 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Nordbrock died of the electrical charge despite prolonged efforts to revive 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at what it took to claim his life," Swift said. "He was in the highest 
place in the United States you can be, and there's Matt, in the center of the 
room, talking to a bunch of people, and God just had to get his highest weapon 
to take him off this earth." 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services will be held Friday in Tucson.

Struggling again to glean the identity of a man accused of fleecing clients of 
thousands of dollars, a Harbor Municipal Court judge on Monday ordered the 
defendant to remain in jail. 
</P>
<P>
After twice pressing the man for his true name and date of birth, Judge Susanne 
S. Shaw got this response: 
</P>
<P>
"Your honor," said the defendant, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The defendant's attorney then added that her client was invoking his 
constitutional right, under the Fifth Amendment, to avoid self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Countered Shaw: "That's fine. That's great. He can remain in jail. He can 
remain John Doe forever if he wants. His bail is to remain. Aloha." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, that wasn't all. 
</P>
<P>
Before the defendant was led back to jail, held under bail of $100,000, Shaw 
offered her own exposition on constitutional privilege. 
</P>
<P>
"You think you have a Fifth Amendment right," Shaw said. "That's great, because 
we have a Fifth Amendment right to have bail in this matter. . . . You're going 
to be John Doe and Mr. Defendant until we find out who you are. I think we have 
a right to know what your true date of birth is, where you were born. If you 
don't want to give us that, that's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Connie Johnson also announced during the arraignment that 
the defendant, accused of using as many as 10 aliases, is being charged with a 
new felony grand theft count. Johnson said the charge was filed after a woman 
who read news accounts of the case identified the defendant as the "lawyer" to 
whom she paid $3,000 in a divorce case. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews and court records show that the defendant was known to many clients 
and lawyers as J. Christopher Kennedy, the name of an attorney who is licensed 
by the State Bar of California. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other aliases used by the defendant, according to the records, were: 
Jeffery Biddle Smith, Christopher Chamberlain, Philip Santos Centineo and 
Christopher Larry Parks. He varied those names by slightly changing spellings 
and the middle names, according to the records.

DUKES HOLD OFF SAN ANTONIO RACQUETS TO RECORD FIRST VICTORY ON THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playing their first road match in franchise history, the Newport Beach Dukes 
defeated the San Antonio Racquets, 25-22, Monday at the Thousand Oaks Racquet 
Club in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Dukes Coach Greg Patton said he expected San Antonio (2-1) to be one of the 
strongest teams in Team Tennis' West Division, but the men's doubles and mixed 
doubles matches proved the difference in helping Newport Beach improve to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Davis joined Roger Smith to defeat Sammy Giammalva and Dacio Campos in 
men's doubles and give the Dukes a 6-2 lead. Later, Davis and Sophie Amiach 
defeated Campos and Mary Lou Daniels, 6-1, in mixed doubles, extending the lead 
to 14-9. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Frazier of the Dukes won her third consecutive women's singles match, 
defeating Elna Reinach in a tiebreaker, 6-5 (5-4), after trailing in the 
tiebreaker, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio made a run at the Dukes in women's doubles, the last match of the 
evening. Reinach and Daniels trailed Frazier and Amiach, 4-2, but won four 
consecutive games to force an overtime. 
</P>
<P>
With the Dukes leading, 24-20, Reinach and Daniels needed to win four 
consecutive games to force a super-tiebreaker. They took the first two games of 
overtime before the Dukes broke Daniels' serve. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's match was originally scheduled for Sunday, but rain forced a delay. 
The Dukes' trip continues tonight with a match against Wellington, Fla., a team 
in the East Division.

ANGELS: EDMONTON OUTFIELDER MAKES MOST OF HIS MAJOR LEAGUE DEBUT IN PLACE OF 
THE INJURED WALLY JOYNER AT FIRST BASE.

First anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
First major league game. 
</P>
<P>
First start. 
</P>
<P>
At first base, naturally. 
</P>
<P>
First base hit in his first at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
First run batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Stevens just hopes it won't be the last. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens and his wife, Kim, went out for dinner Sunday night, in celebration of 
their wedding one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
When they returned to the Portland hotel where the Angels' triple-A Edmonton 
team was staying, they got good news -- "a present," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
He had been called to Anaheim to replace Wally Joyner, who Monday was placed on 
the 15-day disabled list with a possible stress fracture of the right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens made his major league debut Monday night in the Angels' 3-1 loss to 
Milwaukee at Anaheim Stadium, and he made a lasting impression. He went three 
for four with a double and an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
He played first base admirably, though he spent much of his time playing the 
outfield for Edmonton, where he was batting .293 with 16 home runs and 31 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, a first-round draft choice in 1986, distinguished himself at the plate 
and in the field, in particular making a leaping, back-handed snag of a sharp 
liner over the bag by Dave Parker. 
</P>
<P>
But for all his success, Stevens found himself in a position to disappoint, as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens was tagged out at the plate in the sixth inning as he tried to score 
from second on Donnie Hill's single to left. B.J. Surhoff, the Brewers' 
catcher, blocked the plate well and the play was more Surhoff's success than 
Stevens' failure. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens' final at-bat came with two out in the eighth inning, with runners on 
first and second and the Angels trailing, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers brought on left-hander Dan Plesac to face Stevens, a left-handed 
hitter. The move worked. Stevens struck out, swinging big. 
</P>
<P>
After getting the word Sunday, Lee and Kim spent the first couple hours on the 
phone to parents and friends. They arrived in Anaheim around 1:30 in the 
afternoon, and when he arrived at Anaheim Stadium, Stevens learned he would 
start, even though all his equipment had not yet arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, on the disabled list for the first time in his five-season major league 
career, lent his glove. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm still in shock," Stevens said after batting practice. "Obviously, 
I'm happy. I was very excited. I couldn't wait to get here. I'm just going to 
try to stay on an even keel." 
</P>
<P>
In his first at-bat, Stevens worked the count full against Brewer starter Ron 
Robinson and then lined a single to right. 
</P>
<P>
The souvenir ball was hustled into the Angel dugout, where pitcher Bert 
Blyleven, the team prankster, spent a very long time inscribing it. 
</P>
<P>
He was still at it when Stevens got another first -- first time caught 
stealing. 
</P>
<P>
The next time Stevens came up, the game was still scoreless in the fourth 
inning. The Angels had runners on first and third after singles by Dave 
Winfield and Lance Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens drove in the game's first run with his second single of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Later, with the score tied, 1-1, in the sixth inning, he nearly scored the 
go-ahead run. With two out, Stevens doubled off the wall in center. Hill 
singled, and Stevens tried to score. Surhoff tried to stop him, and did. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have found themselves in a pinch recently, with Joyner missing the 
last four games. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schroeder, their backup catcher, spelled Joyner the first day. On the 
second, Hill added first base to his list of positions played, which covers 
every infield spot but catcher. Rick Schu filled in on the third day, and Hill 
again on the fourth.

ROCKWELL TO MOVE ITS HEADQUARTERS TO ORANGE COUNTY

Rockwell International Corp. announced plans Monday to move its corporate 
headquarters from a leased building in El Segundo to a company-owned facility 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The move will make Rockwell, a diversified defense, electronics and aerospace 
firm with annual revenues of more than $12.5 billion, by far the largest public 
company based in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making this move from leased office space to provide an improved, more 
efficient working environment in company-owned facilities for our employees," 
said Donald R. Beall, Rockwell's chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
The relocation, which affects only about 235 employees, is slated to be 
completed in January, 1992, spokesman Jeff Charney said. 
</P>
<P>
It will also make Beall's daily commute a little easier. He lives in Newport 
Beach and typically flies from John Wayne Airport to El Segundo by helicopter. 
Rockwell officials said the move is not related to Beall's commute. Rather, 
Charney said, the headquarters is being moved because it will be a better use 
of corporate assets to occupy a building already owned by Rockwell instead of 
leasing space. 
</P>
<P>
The 250,000-square-foot, eight-story building is partially occupied by the 
company's information-systems unit. To make room for the headquarters staff, 
some of the 594 employees in the information-systems unit will be moved 
elsewhere within the complex, spokesman Fred Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
The new headquarters will be lodged in a 23-year-old building within a 100-acre 
complex owned by Rockwell in Seal Beach, where the company already has a large 
presence with its Strategic Defense Center and its Satellite &amp; Space 
Electronics division. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell, which has 109,000 employees worldwide, is the second-largest employer 
in Orange County with 10,800 workers here. Only Hughes Aircraft Co. has more 
workers in the county. Rockwell will surpass Irvine-based Fluor Corp., which 
has annual sales of $6.3 billion, as the largest public company based here. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell's operations scattered throughout the county reflect the corporation's 
diverse range of businesses. The company makes everything from guidance systems 
for the MX missile in Anaheim to communications satellites in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The operations include the defense electronics group in Anaheim, which employs 
6,300 people; the satellite and space electronics unit in Seal Beach with 1,181 
people, and a semiconductor manufacturing group in Newport Beach with 1,335. 
The rest of the company's employees in the county are scattered throughout 
other sites in Cypress, Seal Beach, Anaheim, Newport Beach and Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Lucien Truhill, president and chief executive of the Orange County Chamber of 
Commerce, welcomed Rockwell's move. 
</P>
<P>
"While the numbers of employees are small, it is a significant corporate 
headquarters relocation," Truhill said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the county has lost several corporate headquarters in the past 
few years. The most noteworthy was when American Stores, a multibillion-dollar 
supermarket chain, moved its headquarters from Irvine to Salt Lake City in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
While other defense companies are laying off workers, Rockwell has cushioned 
itself by reducing its dependence on defense revenues for several years. Last 
year, the company's defense electronics operation accounted for only 26.9% of 
revenue in fiscal 1989, contrasted with 49.7% in fiscal 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For the year ended Sept. 30, 1989, Rockwell reported net income of $734.9 
million on revenue of $12.5 billion, compared with net income of $811.9 million 
on revenue of $11.9 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell has occupied the building in El Segundo since 1975, and the 
headquarters staff moved from Pittsburgh into that building in 1987. Beall said 
the company will keep its North American Aircraft unit, which has 3,800 
employees, in El Segundo.

20-STORY RESORT HOTEL TO RISE BY SEA IN HUNTINGTON BEACH;

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A development firm revealed plans Monday for a $115-million, 20-story hotel 
that would be the tallest structure along the Orange County coast. 
</P>
<P>
The 500-room hotel, a key part of this beach town's redevelopment, is the 
second of four resort hotels planned for a half-mile-long development on 
Pacific Coast Highway known as The Waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, a partnership called the Waterfront Inc., which includes 
prominent builder Robert Mayer, hopes to begin the hotel's construction in 
December and finish in late 1992, said Stephen K. Bone, president of the 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
The project is part of a major redevelopment that is transforming the city's 
beachfront from a funky, casual surfer's haven to an upscale resort. While some 
neighborhood activists fret about the change, boosters say it will help the 
city hold its own against the snazzy hotels in nearby beach towns. 
</P>
<P>
"Huntington Beach is a city of 200,000 with very few amenities," said Bone, a 
former lawyer. "The city has always been the hole in the doughnut of economic 
development. Now it's starting to come together." 
</P>
<P>
The Waterfront is a $600-million project on a triangle-shaped, 50-acre parcel 
just across Pacific Coast Highway from the beach between Beach Boulevard and 
Huntington Street, just south of the Huntington Beach Pier. Its four hotels 
will have 1,450 hotel rooms by completion in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
The new hotel, which will probably be a Sheraton, will be built on the current 
site of the two-story Best Western Huntington Beach Inn. That structure will be 
torn down to make way for the new hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel proposal will be presented for approval to the city's Planning 
Commission in August. As proposed, it will tower above surrounding buildings. 
The tallest structure on the county's coast now is the 18-story Union Bank 
Building at Newport Center in Newport Beach. That building is owned by The 
Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the four hotels at The Waterfront -- the $55-million, 300-room 
Waterfront Hilton -- opens next week. On Monday workers were scurrying about, 
putting the finishing touches on the 12-story, Mediterranean-style building, 
which is surfaced with stucco and roofed with tile. 
</P>
<P>
The developer is also planning to build an all-suites hotel -- estimated at 250 
rooms -- by 1994. Then a fourth hotel -- the most elegant of the four, with 450 
rooms -- will be constructed at the corner of Beach Boulevard and Pacific Coast 
Highway and opened in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the Waterfront is being built on an existing nine-hole golf course. The 
project will also displace a group of residents now living in mobile homes at 
the end of the property farthest from the beach. The developer plans to build 
nearly 875 houses and condominiums on those 23 acres, which it is buying from 
the city for $10 million plus the costs of resettling the residents. 
</P>
<P>
The land under the hotels along Pacific Coast Highway is also city-owned. It is 
leased to the developers for 99 years. Since there is a considerable amount of 
risk and extra expense -- such as building underground parking -- involved in 
the massive project, Bone said, the city is charging a flat rent for the land 
for the first 25 years. After that there's a clause that allows the city to 
take a percentage of the hotels' revenues, Bone said, as some cities do with 
ballparks and other private uses of public land. 
</P>
<P>
The newest hotel will be more in the Italian style than the Hilton, Bone said. 
It will have an off-white plaster exterior and a tile roof. The exterior will 
alternate one unadorned story with two-story columns separating the windows on 
every second and third floor. The architect is Frizzell Hill Associates, a 
prominent San Francisco firm that has designed many resorts. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel will adjoin a three-story fitness center that will be built at the 
same time. There will also be a footbridge over the four lanes of Pacific Coast 
Highway to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Although hotel experts say a golf course is often essential to the success of a 
resort, the developers say the broad, sandy beach across Pacific Coast Highway 
will more than make up for the lack of a nearby golf course. And golfers will 
also be able to use nearby courses, the developers say. 
</P>
<P>
"All a hotel in the desert has, for instance, is its golf course," said Alan 
Ayres, general manager of the Hilton. "We'll be offering a lot more than golf." 
</P>
<P>
Ayres said that to break even the Hilton, managed by a Dallas concern called 
Signet Management, must reach 63% occupancy while getting an average daily room 
rate of $128. (Without corporate discounts, the rooms start at $145 for a 
single and $160 for a double.) 
</P>
<P>
The hotel should hit that goal next year, Ayres said. The hotel has already 
booked a lot of business meetings, which will make up most of its business 
except in the summer, when leisure travelers are expected to predominate. 
</P>
<P>
While the local hotel business is in a slump, that is mostly due to a decline 
in business travel, say hotel experts, and hotels that cater to tourists are 
doing much better. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the adjoining areas are rapidly changing too. Across Huntington 
Street from the new Hilton, the Huntington Beach Co. is tearing down businesses 
along Pacific Coast Highway to build a retailing center to which it hopes to 
lure pricey stores like Gucci. It will also build homes along the back end of 
its property. 
</P>
<P>
And a new building is planned for the area around the storm-damaged Huntington 
Beach Pier, which is being replaced and will have a park-like plaza at its 
base. 
</P>
<P>
Bone said Mayer is putting up money to acquire the land. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, 
the big Japanese bank, is lending the money for construction and will hold the 
mortgage.

<P>
Ceradyne Inc., the Costa Mesa-based manufacturer of industrial ceramics, posted 
net income of $198,000 for the 1990 second quarter, contrasted with a loss of 
$1.4 million for the quarter in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sales increased 7%, to $6.1 million from $5.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half, the company reported a net profit of $264,000, contrasted 
with a net loss of $2.3 million for the first six months of 1989. Sales were up 
3%, to $12.1 million from $11.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its recovery plan emphasizing cost reductions and operating 
controls was primarily responsible for the favorable results.

JOSEPH N. BELL: SORTING AND SAVORING TRIP'S IMPRESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I have just returned from three weeks in Europe. Several days in 
Paris, coming and going, served as bookends for an extended journey through 
East Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia. We traveled by train, both to save 
money and to better pick up the flavor of these countries. We avoided tours 
like the plague except to take brief orientation trips in each new city we 
visited. 
</P>
<P>
We were fortunate enough to travel with the news. We were in Berlin on the 
first day the border checkpoints went unattended and a common currency was 
adopted. And we were in Czechoslovakia just a few days after the newly freed 
citizens of that country elected Vaclav Havel as their leader in the first 
democratic presidential election there in almost five decades. 
</P>
<P>
Americans -- including a good many from Orange County -- are flocking to 
Eastern Europe this summer, fired by the same curiosity that sent us there. I 
suspect that these visitors -- like us -- will come home with their heads 
stuffed with information, impressions and not a little confusion, since things 
were not always what we expected them to be. 
</P>
<P>
It will probably be many weeks before we sort them out for ourselves, but here 
are some of the vignettes from that trip that come quickly to mind: 
</P>
<P>
* The most universal sign of creeping capitalism in the countries of Eastern 
Europe is the sudden appearance, in every city we visited, of the International 
Herald Tribune. Thus, even in the depths of Poland, I was able to keep abreast 
of the collapse of the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
I also got some tastes of American politics that led to curious reactions in 
Europe. For example, one of the highlights of our trip was the accidental 
discovery of the Rodin Museum in Paris. A few hours after we immersed ourselves 
in this magnificent place, I read an item in the Herald Tribune setting forth 
Orange County Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's conditions for supporting artists through 
the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
And it occurred to me that Rodin would never have qualified under the 
Rohrabacher rules. Much -- perhaps most -- of his work is highly erotic and 
quite specifically, gracefully and magnificently sexual. Thank God he lived 
where he did -- and when he did. 
</P>
<P>
* Through happenstance -- laced with a small dash of stupidity -- we probably 
had the honor of taking the first cab ride from East Berlin to West Berlin. 
Traveling to our hotel, we had peered anxiously out the train window at 
Berlin's Bahnhof Zoo -- which turned out to be only a few blocks from our hotel 
-- but didn't get off because our ticket read "Friederichstrasse." We finally 
got off the train about 6:30 in the morning in East Berlin without visas. 
</P>
<P>
When I finally determined that's where we were, we went out to a cab stand, 
showed a driver the address of our West Berlin hotel, and asked him to drive us 
there. He was stunned, consulted with half a dozen other drivers, and finally 
threw up his hands and motioned us into the cab. He passed through a checkpoint 
gloriously empty, the first morning that such a trip would have been possible. 
</P>
<P>
Once in West Berlin, our driver was totally lost and had to ask several times 
how to get to our hotel. I suspect it was the first time he'd ever been there. 
But he found it, and we shook hands, all of us glowing at this new and shining 
manifestation of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
* Many other signs of incipient capitalism were manifest all over East Berlin. 
Peddlers had set up shop along the route of the wall, selling purported chunks 
of the wall and Russian military hats, among other artifacts. Additional 
entrepreneurs were on hand to rent hammers and chisels to visitors to knock out 
their own sections of the wall. We paid 5 deutsche marks for this apparatus and 
chipped away for 15 minutes, finding the wall virtually impenetrable and 
working up a considerable sweat -- but coming away triumphantly with a 
pocketful of chips. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout our stay, we watched armored cars, escorted by police with 
high-decibel sirens, carrying money from West to East to support the merging of 
currencies. One German told us with almost lip-smacking eagerness that the land 
released by the destruction of the wall would be very high-priced real estate. 
I could envision Wall Drugs and Wall Barber Shop and the Wall Restaurant. And 
we saw a poster in East Germany advertising an upcoming game between the Kansas 
City Chiefs and the "Orange County" Rams. 
</P>
<P>
* Music offered a constant -- and changing -- accompaniment to our travels. 
Jazz bands played on the streets of West Berlin, and sidewalk flutists played 
Bach in East Berlin. Warsaw and Krakow in Poland were devoid -- totally devoid 
-- of music. In Prague, street music was joyously present on almost every 
corner, mostly light rock and ethnic music offered up by a people suddenly and 
wonderfully free and wanting to sing about it. And in Vienna, canned Strauss 
waltzes provided a Muzak accompaniment to the clack of cash registers in almost 
every drug store and restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
* It is difficult to give things away, even amid the grinding poverty of 
Poland. My wife brought along a batch of T-shirts and an assortment of small 
children's toys, intending to pass them out when opportunities presented 
themselves. I was a little uneasy about this, remembering Hershey bars in World 
War II. I was even more uneasy when a little Polish boy stiffed an offer of a 
toy. But then we discovered that the gifts could be better offered for services 
rendered. Even so, we came back with several T-shirts, mute evidence that pride 
-- and perhaps a little suspicion -- takes precedence over poverty. 
</P>
<P>
* The World Cup was going on while we were traveling, and the natives 
everywhere -- especially in Germany -- were glued to TV sets while the games 
were in progress. I watched, more or less in self-defense, and got mildly 
hooked on soccer, at least until Cameroon was eliminated. But I couldn't help 
thinking that these posturing and frequently sulking soccer millionaires 
wouldn't last 10 minutes in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
* These random, and occasionally piffling, observations were acutely necessary 
in order for us to cope with our day at the Nazi extermination camp in 
Auschwitz. The enormity of what took place there, seen and felt in the actual 
surroundings, simply can't be easily grasped nor dwelt upon, for it would 
exclude every other impression. But it has impregnated our consciousness and 
will be there always. 
</P>
<P>
The (necessary) ability of the human mind to look sideways rather than 
straight-on at a horror like Auschwitz was accentuated by a bizarre turn of 
events the day we visited. When we rounded the corner of the first set of 
barracks, we ran into a whole covey of prisoners, dirty and bedraggled, dressed 
in prison uniforms and being herded by Nazi officers restraining snarling dogs. 
The effect was both frightening and surreal. 
</P>
<P>
A Polish film company was making a movie there, and for the rest of our visit, 
we kept running into the actors. This merging of reality and unreality made me 
realize that the only way we can grasp these extermination camps is to see them 
as some kind of movie. And for several hours we had to look at the reality -- 
shower rooms that spewed deadly gas instead of water, crude ovens, gallows on 
which Jewish prisoners were hung as examples to the other workers, torture 
chambers, medical laboratories where experiments were performed on living 
people -- superimposed on the mythic being performed by actors. We'll never be 
the same again. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday I'll offer some reflections about the political scene in Eastern 
Europe from the vantage point of an Orange County tourist, along with some of 
the surprises we found that will condition our thinking in following the news 
during the months ahead. Then back to the Orange County scene -- in which there 
are more than a few parallels.

Five days after she gave birth by Cesarean section, Penni Wagenblast was out on 
the street with no clothes, no car and nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
Wagenblast's husband was caring for their three children at home in Big Bear, 
but she had to stay near her infant son, Kyle, who was born six weeks 
prematurely in Saint Joseph Hospital in Orange. He remained in intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old mother showed up last January at the door of the Ronald 
McDonald House, the three-story house in Orange that Herb and Pat Watson have 
made a "home away from home" for families of children hospitalized with serious 
illnesses or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ronald McDonald House, Wagenblast found clothes, a comfortable room and 
volunteers willing to clean her room while she recuperated from the complicated 
pregnancy and surgery, which required that she be flown by helicopter from Big 
Bear to Orange County. She was also recoving from the loss of Kyle's twin 
brother and a grueling five-week hospital stay before the birth. 
</P>
<P>
At the brightly furnished house, Wagenblast also found the Watsons, a cheerful 
couple who treated her like a daughter, picking her up at the hospital late at 
night in the rain and chatting with her about her son's progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I would never have made it through had it not been for the support of 
those people in that house," Wagenblast said of the first of several stays at 
the Ronald McDonald House. "If it hadn't been for someone to put their arms 
around me and tell me everything was OK, I never would have made it." 
</P>
<P>
Wagenblast showed her gratitude Saturday afternoon by throwing a "shower" at 
the house. Twenty former guests and volunteers returned for two hours, bearing 
gifts. "We received car seats that we can use in the van in case we have to 
transport someone with a child, an infant seat, a walker, a crib, bibs, food 
and toys," said Pat Watson, a grandmotherly woman with a bright smile. "It was 
a really special, one-time event. We even had enough money donated so we can 
buy a stroller. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all Penni Wagenblast's idea," Pat said. "She was back here because her 
son just had surgery at Children's Hospital (of Orange County). She wanted to 
give back to the house something, so she arranged this whole thing, had the 
cake and punch donated and put together a package trip to Big Bear, which one 
of the volunteers won." 
</P>
<P>
The Watsons, longtime Orange County residents, live at the Ronald McDonald 
House and run the place as a team. 
</P>
<P>
Since the house opened in November, 1989, the Watsons have sheltered more than 
250 families, who sleep, eat, shower and relax at the Batavia Street home 
between long, taxing vigils at their children's bedsides. Twenty cozy, 
hotel-sized rooms can accommodate mothers who are alone or families of up to 
four. Most guests stay free. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people arrive here with only the clothes on their backs," Pat Watson 
said. Along with a battalion of 81 volunteers and a host of donors, the Watsons 
try to provide everything else. Given the storage rooms stocked with soap, 
shampoo, canned food, toys, T-shirts and other supplies, not much is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell them we're like the Ritz only we don't have the view, we're cheaper 
and there's no room service," Pat said. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Watson, who previously raised funds for CHOC, serves as executive director 
for the house, promoting public awareness and making sure there is enough money 
to run the $800-a-day operation without charging families more than $5 a night. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old former Boys' Club of Tustin director is involved with local 
fund-raisers and with creating an endowment he hopes will one day provide the 
house with a steady revenue stream. 
</P>
<P>
His wife Pat is the house manager. She lays down the rules, makes sure they are 
kept -- and broken when appropriate -- and keeps the house meticulously neat. 
</P>
<P>
One of Pat's cardinal rules is that she will not provide counseling, but for 
those who need to spill a few tears, she provides some TLC and an understanding 
ear. The relationships often become personal; when Wagenblast's 6-month-old son 
returned to the hospital for surgery this time, Watson was the designated blood 
donor. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat is like a mother to me," Wagenblast said. "And I needed a mother real bad 
at that time. I still feel the need to call Pat and tell her what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
For the Watsons, who married 17 years ago, running the county's Ronald McDonald 
House has become a special mission. Herb, as director of development at CHOC, 
helped start plans for the house in 1986. He resigned from his job at CHOC to 
take on the executive director's post. 
</P>
<P>
Pat, a 30-year veteran of "the volunteer business," helped at the house when it 
opened. After the first house manager left a month later, Pat said to Herb, 
"Let's sell the house and do this." 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'You're kidding?' " Pat recalled. "I said, 'No, I feel this is what 
the Lord wants us to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
So they did. 
</P>
<P>
After Pat got the job, the couple rented their Tustin home to their youngest 
daughter, gave irreplaceable family treasures to their children and sold the 
rest of their belongings at a garage sale. 
</P>
<P>
"You've given up all your things," a friend remarked to Pat. 
</P>
<P>
"You've said the magic word," Pat remembered answering. "They're just things." 
</P>
<P>
The Watsons' new jobs are made easier by their new extended family: the 
volunteers, known affectionately as "The Bunch of Pushy Broads" or "Herb's 
Harem." Though the work at the house is often simply housework, the volunteers 
have fun. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always laughing," said Marguerite Price, a volunteer and paid weekend 
relief manager. 
</P>
<P>
Also aiding the effort are the house's many sponsors, who contributed hundreds 
of thousands of dollars in cash, goods and supplies. Generous donations meant 
the $2.5-million house was built for $901,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the first Ronald McDonald House to open without a mortgage," Herb 
said. There are at least 132 Ronald McDonald houses worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Cash came from McDonald franchisees and 150 other organizations; appliances 
came from Whirlpool, construction labor from Mike Harrison Construction, more 
than 100 quilts from the Southern California Quilting Club, paper products from 
Scott Towels and Bibles from Gideon. 
</P>
<P>
The list seems endless and the gifts boundless. So many people have donated 
books that the Watsons have had to put them in one of four self-storage units 
-- donated, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"And every day the phone rings with people wanting to give us something," Pat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Living in what is known as the "house that love built" eases the painful times. 
Day in and day out, the Watsons welcome families in distress, shock and grief. 
</P>
<P>
For Herb, whose years at CHOC familiarized him with the sight of worried 
parents camped outside Intensive Care, the atmosphere at the Ronald McDonald 
House is cheerful and relaxed by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
For some families, Herb pointed out, the house provides the first shower and 
bed they've seen for days. They find other parents going through the same 
ordeal. And for many of them, Herb said, the House is nicer than any place 
they've ever lived. 
</P>
<P>
For Pat, the sad side is more palpable. She often has long talks with mothers 
who are nursing very ill infants or whose children are going to die. 
</P>
<P>
Former guests, as well as volunteers, heap praise on the Watsons and attribute 
the generous spirit of the house to them. 
</P>
<P>
But to the Watsons, the success of Orange County's Ronald McDonald House is the 
teamwork that keeps the doors open and the lights on. 
</P>
<P>
"You're dealing with the best people," Herb said. "You're dealing with people 
who are giving as opposed to asking, 'What's in it for me?' It's the most 
rewarding project you could ever be involved in."

HOT, SMOGGY DAYS ARE A CHALLENGE TO EXERCISERS: SOME TIPS TO SURVIVE;

THERE ARE MANY WAYS FOR FITNESS BUFFS TO AVOID FATIGUE AND ILLNESS. OVERALL, IT

<P>
You've made the commitment to work up a sweat on a regular basis as part of a 
fitness regimen, and what's more, you're sticking to it. But what happens on 
those hot, smoggy days when the sweat breaks out before you've even finished 
tying your running shoes? How can you keep yourself fit without making yourself 
sick in the process? 
</P>
<P>
Shift your workout time to 7 a.m. to take advantage of the cooler morning air? 
That might help, but for some it only makes things worse, says Dr. Bruce 
Nelson, a Capistrano Valley allergist. "There's a lot more air pollution during 
the heavy commute times," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Switch from jogging to swimming for the summer? You may not get a comparable 
aerobic workout, says Dr. Archie Wilson, who heads the pulmonary department at 
UC Irvine Medical Center. "It's a nice way to cool off, but very few people are 
as well-conditioned to swim at high continuous levels as they are to walk fast 
or run, so it's difficult to get the same exercise benefit from swimming." 
</P>
<P>
Take salt tablets to replace the sodium lost in perspiration? Don't, says 
physical therapist and exercise physiologist Mary Bailey of St. Jude Medical 
Center in Fullerton. "Unless you're a marathon runner or a triathlete, that 
probably isn't necessary." 
</P>
<P>
OK. How about a cold shower? 
</P>
<P>
"That may sound good, but it's really better to cool down a little slower," 
says Dr. James Lindberg, medical director of the UCI Executive Health Program. 
</P>
<P>
But there are healthy ways to work around hot summer weather when you're 
working out, say these and other experts. 
</P>
<P>
The top item on the list, both in sequence and importance, is water. An hour 
before you exercise, says Lindberg, prehydrate yourself by drinking a couple 
glasses of water. During exercise, continue to sip water, "a few swallows at a 
time." 
</P>
<P>
And even after your workout is over, keep sipping, says Bailey. "You should 
have 15 to 20 ounces during exercise, and three to six ounces afterward." 
</P>
<P>
Don't wait until you're thirsty, either. "In extreme conditions, thirst is no 
longer a good indicator of whether you need liquids," Bailey says. 
</P>
<P>
Dehydration is a common problem, the experts say. One easy way to determine how 
much you're affected by it is to weigh yourself before and after exercise. "If 
you've lost more than 2% of your body weight, that's too much," she says. 
</P>
<P>
A glass of ice water might sound like just the ticket, but the experts caution 
that cool water is less of a shock to the system. 
</P>
<P>
You may not have much of an appetite, but don't neglect to eat, either. "In the 
morning, a piece of toast without butter, maybe with a little jelly and a glass 
of juice," Lindberg suggests. "You want to eat light, and emphasize 
carbohydrates rather than fats." 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to plain water for hydration, Eckerling suggests Gatorade or 
a similar beverage. But Bailey says beverages high in sugar should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
The same things that make an aerobic workout beneficial -- whether it's 
jogging, brisk walking, biking or another activity -- can make it dangerous in 
hot, smoggy weather. 
</P>
<P>
"When you exercise, you breathe a lot more," Wilson says. "The normal five to 
six quarts of air per minute goes up 20 times or more, depending on the level. 
Obviously, if there are bad things in the air, you'll be breathing them in at 
least 20 times as much. 
</P>
<P>
People with lung problems, Wilson says, "probably could exercise as well as 
they usually do. And asthma patients might actually do better. They tend to get 
worse if they breathe in air that is either dry or cold or both. Obviously when 
it's hot and humid, that's not a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Allergist Nelson agrees. Some asthmatics, he says, even do better exercising in 
the middle of the day. "It's an individual sort of thing. Moist air, however, 
does cause problems because it's more likely to contain particulate matter, 
which can irritate the lungs." 
</P>
<P>
If you use medicines for asthma or other respiratory problems, Nelson says, 
"it's best to take them before exercise, rather than waiting until afterward 
when problems show up." 
</P>
<P>
And if you can, exercise near the beach, where the temperature can be 20 
degrees (or more) cooler, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Stretching, warming up and cooling down are even more important in hot weather, 
Lindberg says. "Before you get in the shower, give yourself a cool-down period, 
such as a cool-down walk, for 10 to 15 minutes to let your body temperature 
come down gradually." 
</P>
<P>
Those who exercise regularly react differently to heat, Bailey says. "As you 
get more fit, your body will perspire sooner, more, and over a greater area of 
your body surface. All that helps facilitate evaporation and cools you off 
faster." 
</P>
<P>
The first days of a heat wave can be the most dangerous, she says, because the 
body has not yet had time to adjust. "Research has shown that as people become 
more heat-acclimated, their bodies change. Someone not used to the heat will 
perspire with a heavy concentration of electrolyte. As you get used to the 
heat, your perspiration becomes more dilute." 
</P>
<P>
While you're exercising, be on the alert for heat-related problems. "If you 
have chest pains, definitely stop and get help," Lindberg says. Other symptoms 
to look for: dizziness, weakness, extreme fatigue. "If your skin becomes very, 
very dry, that's a serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
If you experience those symptoms, try to find a cool place out of the sun, 
drink water and try to get some assistance, Lindberg says. 
</P>
<P>
The least-serious heat injury, Bailey says, is heat cramps. Bailey says women 
and children are at higher risk for heat illnesses and injury than men: "Women 
because they don't sweat as much, and their bodies generally have less fluid to 
circulate. And children have a much higher surface area per kilogram of body 
weight than adults. So don't use yourself as a guide on how hot a child might 
be."

Robbie Shelton -- The Times incorrectly reported that Western High School

Shelton was eligible and played all of last season but was ineligible to play 
in the summer league before the Southern Section approved a fifth year of

The two buildings with greatest historical significance in Anaheim were 
transplanted to this neighborhood, like the city founders themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim had its start when 50 German colonists living in San Francisco wanted 
to move to Southern California to grow grapes and make wine. But planting 
grapes wasn't their only reason: They thought San Francisco would be a bad 
influence on their families. 
</P>
<P>
The Gold Rush of 1848 had brought saloons, miners and brothels to San 
Francisco. The colonists wanted to go to a new place and start afresh. So they 
hired surveyor and civil engineer George Hansen to choose a site and lay out 
the town where they would settle. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen bought 1,165 acres at $2 an acre in the area that would become Anaheim. 
He divided the land into 20-acre lots for the vineyards, with the central 20 
reserved for 64 house lots. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's home and office from 1857 to 1863 is a modest wood-frame building, the 
first of its kind to be built in Orange County (adobe being the prevailing 
building material). Its original site was 235 N. Los Angeles St. (now Anaheim 
Boulevard) between Cypress and Chartres streets. 
</P>
<P>
When E.E. Beazley purchased the land in the late 1920s, he thought the location 
would be ideal for a service station. But when he made his intentions known to 
tear down the house, residents protested. Beazley donated the house to the city 
of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Horstmann Dwyer, a member of Mother Colony chapter of the Daughters of 
the American Revolution, offered the land on West Street where her father, F.A. 
Horstmann, had grown his crops. She deeded the property to the Mother Colony 
chapter of the DAR in 1929 and the house was moved to its present location, 410 
West St. 
</P>
<P>
Today, this five-room wooden house with redwood floors and a latticed porch is 
called the Pioneer House of the Mother Colony. (Germany was the motherland of 
most of Anaheim's original settlers.) It was the county's first museum and is 
today a California historical landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Within its walls is the towel of "A.H.," Amalie Hammer, the first bride of 
Anaheim; an upright piano, surviving a flood in 1884 and landing on a river 
bank while the house was washed away, was donated by Anna Fischer De Frees, the 
first child born to a colonist's family. 
</P>
<P>
The contiguous site on West Street offers respite for yet another house. The 
building known today as the American Red Cross-Anaheim House was originally 
located at Center and Palm Streets (today Lincoln Avenue and Harbor Boulevard), 
an area slotted for redevelopment. This grand two-story house, embellished with 
stained-glass windows and a turret crowned by a cupola, was built by John 
Woelke in 1894 as his residence. 
</P>
<P>
But the DAR was able to save the house when Mr. and Mrs. Dwyer (Lera, the 
second Mrs. Dwyer) bought the house in 1950 for $5,000 and had it moved next 
door to the Mother Colony House. The house was subsequently donated to the Red 
Cross in 1953. (The Anaheim Red Cross is itself historically significant: 
founded in 1917, it was Orange County's second chapter; Fullerton was first by 
a couple of months.) 
</P>
<P>
As the site for these two buildings would suggest, much of the land here 
remained working farms until the turn of the century. Behind these ancient 
houses lie the playing fields of the Anaheim High School. 
</P>
<P>
The houses in the neighborhood today are predominantly single-family homes, 
grand in their demeanor and some of the oldest in Anaheim. North of Lincoln 
Avenue the lot sizes are large. In the westernmost part of this area the trees 
are likely to be the oldest residents. 
</P>
<P>
South of Lincoln Avenue, lot sizes are substantially smaller and houses of 
varying ages are in closer proximity, as Anaheim's downtown area must have 
looked at its inception. But at the neighborhood's southern border, Santa Ana 
Street has met the fate of many of the neighborhood's older houses: it is torn 
apart -- fortunately, though, for repair. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Historical Commission marker, set on a pedestal at the 
westerly end of Center Street, commemorates the San Pedro Gate, which stood at 
the corner of West and Center streets. In earlier times a fence of living 
willow trees kept livestock outside the city limits, and this gate was opened 
to permit travel to and from San Pedro and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But this gate is also a reminder of Anaheim's birth: It was through this gate 
that barrels of wine were hauled to the Anaheim Landing for shipment. ELENA

A man who allegedly shot his wife in the arm and then barricaded himself in a 
Canoga Park home for nearly three hours was arrested this morning by SWAT team 
members who fired tear gas into the house, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Tobin Decenario, 45, was arrested on an assault with a deadly weapon charge and 
is being held at the West Valley Division jail, Lt. Reggie Maeweather said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about midnight Monday on the 7800 block of Kentland Avenue. 
Police said Decenario had been drinking heavily, threatened to commit suicide 
and allegedly fired a shot from a handgun, slightly injuring his wife in the 
arm, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose name was not released, and the couple's three young children 
fled from the home. 
</P>
<P>
Police surrounded the house and called a Special Weapons and Tactics team after 
Decenario refused to leave the house and would not talk with officers, 
Maeweather said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of surrounding homes were evacuated during the three-hour standoff 
that ended shortly after 3 a.m. when the SWAT team fired tear gas into 
Decenario's house, police said.

Richard M. Nixon arrived in Southern California today on the first stop of a 
trip that will peak Thursday when Republican Party leaders and current and 
former Presidents gather to dedicate Nixon's library 16 years after he left 
office in disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's first scheduled event of the week is a meeting with former President 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The two are slated to meet this afternoon in Century City and again this 
evening at Reagan's Bel-Air home. 
</P>
<P>
The library will be dedicated Thursday, and there the two men will be joined by 
Gerald R. Ford and George Bush, rounding out the Republican Party's list of 
living current and former chief executives. 
</P>
<P>
Local leaders will also be on hand for the ceremony. County Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez, a Nixon admirer who caught the former President's attention with a 
speech to the Republican National Convention in 1988, will be among a handful 
of speakers who will address dedication guests Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
At the library today, workers scrambled to make last-minute preparations, 
watering flowers, pruning trees and setting up dozens of white tents for 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
Star Irvine, one of the workers helping to install the sound system for the 
event, eyed the area today and acknowledged that there's plenty left to do. "To 
get it done by Thursday, we may be working around the clock," Irvine said.

The Israeli Supreme Court today quashed the emergency powers granted to Housing 
Minister Ariel Sharon for a crash building program to house a wave of Soviet 
Jewish immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's new right-wing government gave Sharon the right July 1 to circumvent 
existing rules in order to rush construction of 3,000 new apartments and 
prepare the groundwork for another 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled in favor of parliamentarian Avraham Poraz of the 
centrist Shinui party, who charged that Sharon's emergency powers were 
unreasonable and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"It was possible to build houses at all the sites that Minister Sharon wanted 
to build according to the existing law," Poraz told Army radio after the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact these emergency measures were intended to create an atmosphere of 
public hysteria, an atmosphere of distress." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon, a hard-liner who orchestrated Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, 
received broad powers in the new government to handle the immigration of 
hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
In a second blow to Sharon's ambitious plans to cope with Soviet immigration, 
Tourism Minister Gideon Patt attacked his emergency plan announced Sunday to 
house immigrants in hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"Three-, four- and five-star hotels will not become absorption centers," Patt 
told reporters. "I won't allow it." 
</P>
<P>
Pressure on the government to solve the housing crisis grows daily as the 
number of homeless Israelis swells and dozens of tent cities spring up across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
The growing demand for space has forced up rents, driving many young couples 
and poor families out of their apartments.

BUDGET GAMES OVER: BUSH; 
</P>
<P>
WILL PRESS COMPROMISE ON DEFICIT 
</P>

President Bush said today that disturbing new figures on the federal deficit 
show that the "time for game playing is over," and he pledged to increase 
pressure for a compromise on new taxes and budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting to a crunch," Bush told a group of magazine publishers at the 
White House. "It is absolutely essential that something be done. I will do my 
part." 
</P>
<P>
He spoke a day after the White House Office of Management and Budget boosted 
its estimate of the fiscal 1991 deficit to $168.8 billion -- up $10 billion 
from the Administration's estimates a month ago and up sharply from the $100.5 
billion it estimated in January. 
</P>
<P>
The projected deficit is more than $100 billion above the target of $64 billion 
set by the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional budget negotiators had given mixed reviews to the 
Administration's gloomy assessment -- some saying it would help prod 
slow-moving talks and others suggesting the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
"Given yesterday's news," Bush said today, " . . . the time for game playing is 
over. And we have to get something done that is not only a sound budget 
agreement but is seen by the American people to be a sound budget agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that although he was still "fairly optimistic" such a pact could be 
reached, it will require both spending cuts and tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Bush earlier this month abandoned his 1988 "no new taxes" campaign pledge. 
</P>
<P>
The President said he was fearful "about the confidence in the marketplace" 
should a budget deal not be struck. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be pushing in the next couple of weeks, and the meter is running," 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Budget summit talks between Administration officials and congressional leaders 
enter their third month this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration coupled the release of the revised figures Monday with a 
bleak assessment of how a $100-billion cut in services -- which would be 
triggered this fall by the Gramm-Rudman law in the absence of a budget accord 
-- would affect government services. 
</P>
<P>
The scenarios included eliminating half the nation's 2 million active military 
personnel, reducing hours of operation at the nation's airports and halting 
increased drug interdiction efforts at the country's borders. 
</P>
<P>
No one was willing to say they believed that such dramatic cuts would be 
allowed to stand for very long. As recently as last fall, the Gramm-Rudman law 
required spending cuts that were rolled back as soon as negotiators worked out 
a budget deal. 
</P>
<P>
But some lawmakers argued Monday that the new numbers illustrated a problem 
that had to be dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
"The day of reckoning has arrived," said Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel 
Valley), chairman of the House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican on the Senate Budget 
Committee, said the details should send a message to lawmakers who have opposed 
the budget talks. 
</P>
<P>
"They now have a clear alternative," Domenici said. "If it is not an economic 
summit, it is this," a $100-billion automatic spending cut.

Civil rights forces scored a victory today when the Senate voted to impose a 
30-hour limit on debate on a bill designed to combat discrimination in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Senators voted 62 to 38 to limit debate and avert a filibuster by critics, who 
say the bill would result in the widespread use of hiring quotas by American 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We can talk and talk indefinitely or we can act," said Sen. James M. Jeffords 
(R-Vt.), urging prompt action on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Senators critical of the measure, however, took to the floor before the vote 
and scorned the effort to speed up action. 
</P>
<P>
They said additional time to debate was needed to purge the legislation of 
provisions that they said would not only lead to quotas but also impose an 
array of other hardships on employers.

Rescuers using spotlights and generators worked into the early morning today to 
free hundreds of victims trapped by a major earthquake that killed at least 302 
people, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue efforts were concentrated on the devastated towns of Cabanatuan and 
Baguio, where about 750 people were reported trapped in half a dozen toppled 
hotels and factories. 
</P>
<P>
Television news reports showed the hotels crumbled like accordions, including 
the luxurious Hyatt Terraces and the Nevada hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"There are cries of children and voices of people in these hotels," said Rudy 
Roxas, a rescue coordinator in Baguio told a Manila radio station. "We can't 
say how many there are but the rescuers were trying to reach them." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the earthquake, which hit at 4:26 p.m. Monday and measured 7.7 
in intensity, was centered at Cabanatuan, 60 miles north of Manila. It was the 
most powerful temblor to strike the Philippines in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by U.S.-supplied lights and generators, rescuers battled rain and time to 
reach those still trapped in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military helicopters airlifted 25 victims, including four Americans, for 
treatment in a hospital at Clark Air Base, Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Ron 
Rand said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Nicholas Platt said three officials of the 
U.S. Agency for International Development trapped at the Nevada Hotel while 
attending a seminar had been rescued. He said a fourth U.S. aid official died 
in the hotel but his name was not immediately made public. 
</P>
<P>
The Military Civil Defense said the quake had killed 302 people and injured 
672. The dead include 81 in Baguio, 54 in Dagupan City in Pangasinan, 26 in La 
Union Province, 122 in Nueva Ecija, one in Tarlac and 10 in metropolitan 
Manila. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross said 19,183 people are homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Baguio, 120 miles north of Manila, remains isolated because of landslides and 
downed communications and power lines. At least 70 aftershocks have been 
recorded, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
President Corazon Aquino, accompanied by her 18-year-old daughter Kris, flew by 
helicopter to Cabanatuan City in Nueva Ecija today. She consoled relatives of 
the victims at a building near the toppled six-story Philippine Christian 
College, where crews were attempting to rescue about 100 people pinned inside. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino later declared an emergency in five hard-hit towns to allow swift relief 
and rehabilitation operations.

ABOARD THE YANKEE CAPTAINS

<P>
Rescuers perched in dinghies worked for three hours to untangle a whale from a 
fishing net, then whooped and cheered as the humpback swam free. 
</P>
<P>
The rescuers were nearly capsized Monday when they came within inches of the 
38-foot whale's breathing hole. 
</P>
<P>
The whale named Mallard was discovered earlier in the day thrashing in the 
Atlantic Ocean, 30 miles from Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, did these guys have guts," said Capt. Tom Hill of the Yankee Captains, 
one of the vessels dispatched to try to save the 5-year-old whale. "All it 
would take is one good swipe with a flipper to kill them." 
</P>
<P>
But with patience and daring, the rescuers untangled the net from Mallard's 
flippers, mouth and tail. The 25-ton humpback, spouting and breaching, joined a 
throng of whales that had remained nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers attached buoys to the trailing ends of the net wrapped around 
Mallard and waited for the humpback to tire and rest on the surface. The other 
whales kept a safe distance, except for one that came up alongside the 
entangled mammal and rubbed its head.

12 CUBAN REFUGEES LEAVE CZECH SANCTUARY IN HAVANA

All 12 of the Cuban refugees sheltering in the Czechoslovak Embassy in Havana 
since last week left the embassy voluntarily Monday night and gave themselves 
up to authorities, the Foreign Ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been demonstrated once again that the Cuban government will not accept 
pressure or blackmail of any kind wherever it comes from," the ministry said in 
a statement, defending the government's policy of refusing to negotiate the 
departure of the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The surrender of the 12 followed a day of drama at the embassy in which one 
group of refugees fought with another and also took five Czechoslovak diplomats 
hostage for a five-hour period to demand a plane to fly to the United States. 
The diplomats were later freed. 
</P>
<P>
A Czechoslovak Embassy spokesman also confirmed to Reuters that the 12 Cubans 
had left the diplomatic mission. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia had originally granted them protection as political refugees and 
called on Cuba to let them leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
The embassy spokesman said one of the 12 was taken to the hospital because he 
was suffering from heart problems and the rest handed themselves over to Cuban 
authorities without advising Czechoslovak diplomats, who were informed by Cuban 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement said the 12, whom it described as "anti-social 
elements," gave themselves up unconditionally to authorities and for this 
reason would not be punished. 
</P>
<P>
Five other Cuban refugees continued to occupy the house of the Czechoslovak 
charge d'affaires in the Cuban capital, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The embassy spokesman said he had no information about the situation of the 
five. The Czechoslovak Embassy has refused them protection because they forced 
their way into the diplomat's home. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the refugees has badly strained relations between Cuba and its 
former Communist ally, Czechoslovakia, whose new leaders have openly criticized 
the human rights situation on the Caribbean island. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban Foreign Ministry statement did not mention three other Cuban 
refugees, who are sheltering at the Spanish Embassy.

WELLS FARGO WILL BUY 130 NEW BRANCHES; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: GREAT AMERICAN, WHICH LOST $263.4 MILLION IN 1989, AGREES TO SELL ITS 
CALIFORNIA OPERATIONS FOR $492 MILLION.

<P>
Struggling Great American Bank announced today that it has agreed to sell its 
California branch network to Wells Fargo &amp; Co. for $492 million, pending 
approval by shareholders and federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed transaction includes Great American's 130 California branches with 
assets of $5.9 billion, Great American said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego-based thrift, the country's eighth-largest savings and loan, has 
been struggling against a rising tide of losses since the fourth quarter of 
1988, largely because of a widening loan problem acquired with an Arizona 
thrift that Great American bought in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Losses during 1989 hit a staggering $263.4 million and left Great American 
unable to meet minimum federal capital standards. The thrift must raise $350 
million by the end of the year to avoid a government takeover. 
</P>
<P>
The deal with Wells Fargo would pare down Great American's $15.4 billion in 
assets to between $8 billion and $9 billion. Great American would retain 81 
branch offices in Washington, Arizona and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the branches would be completed in two stages. The 92 offices in 
San Diego, Riverside and Orange counties would be sold by late this year, and 
the rest of the California branches would be sold in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear this morning how many of Great American's estimated 1,800 
employees in California would be retained by Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
With the sale, Wells Fargo is expected to solidify its market position in San 
Diego County, where it has been battling with Security Pacific Bank, the 
state's second-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Great American deal, Wells Fargo had 486 branch offices in 
California and ranked as the third-largest bank in the state with $50.2 billion 
in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo currently has 24 branches in San Diego County and would have 88 
after the deal is completed. Security Pacific has about 65 branches in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo and Security Pacific have been buying up smaller California 
institutions in the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific, with assets of $94.5 billion, remains as the state's 
second-largest bank behind Bank of America. Security Pacific is expected to 
become the largest bank in San Diego County, with 65 branches, once it gets 
final approval from regulators for its $112-million purchase of La Jolla 
Bancorp.

CITICORP PROFITS TUMBLE 37% IN QUARTER

<P>
Citicorp said today its second-quarter profits tumbled 37%, reflecting problems 
the nation's largest banking company is having with real estate loans and the 
failure of Argentina and Brazil to pay loan interest. 
</P>
<P>
The parent of the nation's biggest bank, Citibank, said it earned $248 million, 
or 64 cents a share, for the three months ended June 30 compared with $395 
million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its earnings were up 28% from consumer banking activities and 
44% from international banking and finance activities. 
</P>
<P>
But it said weakness in the real estate market, especially in the United 
States, hurt its results. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp said its credit loss provision was $473 million for the quarter, up 
$144 million from a year earlier. Its commercial loan loss reserve was boosted 
by $58 million, bringing its reserve to $744 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The continuing uncertain real estate environment may cause write-offs to 
continue at relatively high levels until we see some stabilization in values," 
the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company reported an $82-million loss for the quarter on 
cross-border loans due to non-payment of loan interest by Argentina and Brazil. 
Citicorp reported a profit of $25 million from cross-border lending in the 
second quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
For the first six months, Citicorp earned $479 million, or $1.24 a share, down 
48% from $924 million, or $2.63 a share, a year earlier.

Florida Federal Savings Bank agreed to pay more than $18 million to settle 
charges that it billed the Education Department for student loans it had never 
tried to collect, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, finalized late Monday, calls for the thrift to pay $17.89 
million in restitution to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
It also calls for the thrift to correct the credit ratings of students whose 
loans were improperly labeled delinquent. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also calls for Florida Federal to pay $150,000 to release most 
bank officers and employees from liability. 
</P>
<P>
In documents submitted to the Education Department for reimbursement of 
guaranteed student loans, the thrift claimed it had attempted to collect on the 
loans. In fact, it had not done so, the Justice Department said.

A radio talk show host who was suspended for banning black callers returned to 
the air today after his station manager said his action was not malicious. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Lennox, suspended Thursday, returned to the air on WERC-AM. 
</P>
<P>
But station Manager Berkley Fraser said Lennox was removed from his job as news 
director and will be on probation for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Lennox will also be required to develop, produce and serve as host of a special 
series for the station on the topic "Birmingham faces the future," focusing on 
race relations in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Lennox said early in his two-hour talk show on July 11 that he would take no 
calls from blacks that day. Lennox imposed the ban after three employees saw a 
black youth break into a fellow employee's car and take her purse. 
</P>
<P>
Lennox, 40, said later he made "an emotional spur-of-the-moment decision." 
</P>
<P>
He and Fraser issued on-air apologies. On Thursday's pre-suspension show, 
Lennox fielded listener reactions without commenting on them. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser said Monday his investigation showed that Lennox's black ban was "not 
based in malice and his 14-year career was without incidence of any racial 
prejudice."

Teen-agers are risking their lives by taking to sewers on bicycles and 
skateboards in imitation of the stars of the popular U.S. television series 
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," police said today. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman in Melbourne said the children could be drowned or poisoned 
by gases in the sewers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no two ways about it," he said. "If it keeps going some child will 
be drowned. That's the part that frightens us." 
</P>
<P>
"They have obtained maps of the systems and know where they are going in the 
dark," he told reporters. In one recent incident 18 officials spent four hours 
chasing one group of children who escaped untouched. 
</P>
<P>
The animated television series, which is screened daily in Australia, features 
mutant turtles who live in the sewers and fight crime using ninja martial arts.

BOSTON TO HAVE MAPPLETHORPE PHOTO EXHIBIT

Ten years after the film "Caligula" was seized by city vice detectives, the 
controversial photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe will arrive next month with 
the impassioned backing of the Institute of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Far from being banned in Boston, Mapplethorpe's work will receive extra 
security, the director of the institute said, to ensure that it is properly 
showcased in the city where Mapplethorpe died of AIDS a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will also receive corporate sponsorship for the first time on the 
tour, from Phoenix Media/Communications Group. 
</P>
<P>
Despite threats of protest from a Catholic lay group, ICA director David Ross 
said the museum won't omit the seven sexually graphic photographs in the 
exhibit. The collection of 160 photographs, which includes still lifes, 
portraits and nudes, will be on exhibit from Aug. 1 to Oct 4. 
</P>
<P>
"We promised him we would do what we could to make sure the exhibit was shown 
according to his wishes," said Ross. "Robert Mapplethorpe was a friend of mine 
and someone I knew for 15 years. We're showing this because we believe Robert 
Mapplethorpe was an important artist. His work spoke to the tenor of our times, 
as all good artists do." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Lawler of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights said the 
art institute can "count on some strong demonstration of outrage." 
</P>
<P>
Lawler and former Boston Mayor John Collins have called on Mayor Raymond Flynn 
to stop the exhibit. Flynn aides have said the mayor will not block the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Caligula," a sexually graphic 1980 film about ancient Rome, was the last 
casualty of the legendary censorship that led to the phrase "Banned in Boston." 
Since the last century, at least 16 books have been banned in Boston, according 
to the American Library Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy has trailed the Mapplethorpe exhibit in its tour around the 
country. Last month an Ohio judge ruled that an art gallery and its director 
must stand trial for displaying two Mapplethorpe photographs that included nude 
or semi-nude children. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston show concludes an 18-month tour that included stops in Philadelphia; 
Chicago; Washington; Hartford, Conn.; Berkeley, and Cincinnati.

Singer Harry Belafonte, 63, was admitted to Good Samaritan Hospital Monday 
after experiencing chest pains in his hotel room but was released later in the 
day, a hospital administrator said today. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the singer's chest pains were not heart-related, according to a 
hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Belafonte underwent a cardiac catheterization in which the interior of the 
heart is photographed, spokeswoman Judy Twitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Belafonte was admitted for tests at 6 a.m. after being transferred from nearby 
Los Gatos Community Hospital where his condition was assessed by a 
cardiologist, said administrator Truman Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Belafonte became ill in his hotel room after appearing at a concert at a local 
winery. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Good Samaritan said Belefonte was discharged at about 4 p.m.

Soul singer James Brown, serving time for assault, may soon be allowed to live 
at home while completing a work-release program. 
</P>
<P>
The Godfather of Soul is finishing paper work for the so-called extended work 
release. The request is subject to approval by state corrections officials. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old singer received a six-year sentence in 1988 for aggravated 
assault and failing to stop for a police officer. He served 15 months in prison 
and was moved to the work-release program in April. 
</P>
<P>
The work-release center provides education and nutrition to preschoolers and 
job training and other services to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is eligible for parole in December, 1991.

cocaine in Daytona Beach, Fla.

<P>
Bonaduce, 30, pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of attempted purchase of a 
controlled substance as part of an arrangement with prosecutors. The judge also 
ordered him to undergo drug counseling, perform 75 hours of community service 
and pay $675 in court and prosecution charges. Bonaduce, whose record includes 
a 1985 arrest for possession of 50 grams of cocaine in California, was arrested 
in Florida March 9. At the time, he was working as a disc jockey at WEGX-FM in 
Philadelphia.

<P>
"I have no one to speak of as my spouse-to-be and I have a lot to do," Comaneci 
said. "I would like to take my four family members -- my parents, brother and 
sister-in-law -- out of Romania to Canada, where I live now." During her Korean 
stay, Comaneci will visit the Seoul Olympic facilities, meet sports officials 
and sign autographs.

LIZ SMITH: NAVY SEALS FORESEE A BIG CINEMATIC COMING OUT

THERE IS a definite air of excitement among Orion Pictures executives as "Navy 
Seals," starring Charlie Sheen and Michael Biehn, prepares to open Friday. 
Recent screenings of the action-adventure tale received tremendous reaction -- 
and women, surprisingly, were just as turned on by the film as men, leading 
Orion insiders to predict they have another "Top Gun" box-office bonanza on 
their hands. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that audiences go wild finally seeing real American heroes get the bad 
guys (in this case Middle East terrorists). The Seals are an elite, secretive 
arm of the U.S. government's special forces, and they've basically been kept a 
secret since President John F. Kennedy designated them in 1962. (The Seals have 
been known to credit other branches of the armed forces for their successes.) 
</P>
<P>
Now the Seals are coming out, partly because they knew the film was going to be 
made whether they liked it or not, and partly because they want more Seals. 
They want to make young men aware that this outfit exists. So everybody is 
jumping on the "Navy Seals" bandwagon, including the fighting men themselves, 
nine of whom served as technical advisers, and higher-ups in the Navy who are 
convinced that this movie will make the Seals -- no longer a secret operation 
-- a sought-after enlistment.

EARTHA KITT, she of the indestructible growl and purr, has been signed to star 
in Noel Coward's famous 1929 musical "Bitter Sweet." Written by Coward for 
Gertrude Lawrence, it was introduced to Broadway audiences by Evelyn Laye, one 
of the great beauties of the stage, who recently turned a serene 90 in London. 
("Bitter Sweet" was filmed twice, most memorably by Jeanette MacDonald and 
Nelson Eddy in 1940. Coward's score contains, among other gems, the lovely 
"I'll See You Again.") 
</P>
<P>
After tryouts across the country, the show will be brought to New York as a 
major revival.

ARTIE SHAW, the legendary band leader and swing clarinetist of the '30s and 
'40s, who's written three books, is now preparing a fourth. Shaw says he has 
eight chapters, "and when I finish eight more I'll be done." It's fiction, he 
says, "because fiction is the only way to tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw has plenty to tell. Married eight times, to such beauties as Lana Turner, 
Ava Gardner, Evelyn Keyes, Doris Dowling and "Forever Amber" author Kathleen 
Windsor, Artie got a lot of mileage out of his song of seduction "Begin the 
Beguine." Shaw won't think about a publisher until the book is finished, though 
his new movie script is now making the rounds. Artie Shaw, still swinging!

PETE ROSE TO APPEAR ON CRUTCHES FOR SENTENCING ON TAX CHARGES

Pete Rose will probably be on crutches when he appears at his sentencing on tax 
charges Thursday in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
The former Cincinnati Reds manager injured his right knee on Sunday while 
playing stickball with children at a family reunion in Indiana, his publicist, 
Barbara Pinzka, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Pinzka said Rose is to undergo outpatient arthroscopic surgery Friday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pinzka, orthopedist Dr. S. Michael Lawhon diagnosed the injury as 
torn cartilage but said the full extent of the injury and how long it will take 
Rose to recover won't be known until surgery is performed. 
</P>
<P>
Lawhon is the team physician for the Reds. Rose, who played for the Reds from 
1961 to '78 and from 1984 to '86, had a relatively injury-free career but had 
surgery on his left knee in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Rose is to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel on two counts 
of filing a false income tax return. He pleaded guilty to the charges on April 
20. Rose's lawyer, Reuven Katz, said the surgery was scheduled with the 
knowledge of federal probation officials.

An era will end at St. Andrews this week when Arnold Palmer walks down the 18th 
fairway for the last time after 30 years as a living legend of the British 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, approaching his 61st birthday, confirmed today that this was to be his 
final Open, appropriately at the same course where he played in the most 
venerable of the golf championships for the first time in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Palmer has played 21 Opens, winning in 1961 and 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Recognized as the man who resurrected the championship to its current exalted 
status by persuading his fellow American players to follow him across the 
Atlantic, he believes the time has come to fade into the background. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's appropriate I don't play any more, particularly if I keep 
shooting the kind of scores I've been shooting recently," he said. 
"Concentration is the major thing I lack today. I can remember when I played 
and it didn't really matter if I was swinging good or bad. It was all about 
what my mind was telling me at the time.

First anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
First major league game. 
</P>
<P>
First start. 
</P>
<P>
At first base, naturally. 
</P>
<P>
First base hit in his first at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
First run batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Stevens just hopes it won't be the last. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens and his wife, Kim, went out for dinner Sunday night, in celebration of 
their wedding one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
When they returned to the Portland hotel where the Angels' triple-A Edmonton 
team was staying, they got good news -- "a present," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
He had been called to Anaheim to replace Wally Joyner, who Monday was placed on 
the 15-day disabled list with a possible stress fracture of the right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens made his major league debut Monday night in the Angels' 3-1 loss to 
Milwaukee at Anaheim Stadium, and he made a lasting impression. He went three 
for four with a double and an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
He played first base admirably, though he spent much of his time playing the 
outfield for Edmonton, where he was batting .293 with 16 home runs and 31 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, a first-round draft choice in 1986, distinguished himself at the plate 
and in the field, in particular making a leaping, back-handed snag of a sharp 
liner over the bag by Dave Parker. 
</P>
<P>
But for all his success, Stevens found himself in a position to disappoint, as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens was tagged out at the plate in the sixth inning as he tried to score 
from second on Donnie Hill's single to left. B.J. Surhoff, the Brewers' 
catcher, blocked the plate well and the play was more Surhoff's success than 
Stevens' failure. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens' final at-bat came with two out in the eighth inning, with runners on 
first and second and the Angels trailing, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers brought on left-hander Dan Plesac to face Stevens, a left-handed 
hitter. The move worked. Stevens struck out, swinging big. 
</P>
<P>
After getting the word Sunday, Lee and Kim spent the first couple hours on the 
phone to parents and friends. They arrived in Anaheim around 1:30 in the 
afternoon, and when he arrived at Anaheim Stadium, Stevens learned he would 
start, even though all his equipment had not yet arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, on the disabled list for the first time in his five-season major league 
career, lent his glove. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm still in shock," Stevens said after batting practice. "Obviously, 
I'm happy. I was very excited. I couldn't wait to get here. I'm just going to 
try to stay on an even keel." 
</P>
<P>
In his first at-bat, Stevens worked the count full against Brewer starter Ron 
Robinson and then lined a single to right. 
</P>
<P>
The souvenir ball was hustled into the Angel dugout, where pitcher Bert 
Blyleven, the team prankster, spent a very long time inscribing it. 
</P>
<P>
He was still at it when Stevens got another first -- first time caught 
stealing. 
</P>
<P>
The next time Stevens came up, the game was still scoreless in the fourth 
inning. The Angels had runners on first and third after singles by Dave 
Winfield and Lance Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens drove in the game's first run with his second single of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Later, with the score tied, 1-1, in the sixth inning, he nearly scored the 
go-ahead run. With two out, Stevens doubled off the wall in center. Hill 
singled, and Stevens tried to score. Surhoff tried to stop him, and did. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have found themselves in a pinch recently, with Joyner missing the 
last four games. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schroeder, their backup catcher, spelled Joyner the first day. On the 
second, Hill added first base to his list of positions played, which covers 
every infield spot but catcher. Rick Schu filled in on the third day, and Hill 
again on the fourth.

<P>
In the popular culture of postwar Japan, children were fed the same star 
fantasies and dreams of intergalactic space travel as their American 
counterparts, but they were denied the means to live the adventure. Despite its 
many technological marvels, this Earth-bound country had no astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
That is scheduled to change once the U.S. space shuttle program, currently 
beset by technical problems, gets back on track. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's National Space Development Agency has chosen its first payload 
specialist, a poetic physicist named Mamoru Mori, to conduct experiments aboard 
a future shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
Mori, 42, was one of three astronaut candidates selected by NASDA, Japan's 
primary space agency, from 533 applicants in 1985. One of them was to be sent 
into space three years ago, until the U.S. shuttle program was sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Challenger disaster, I was a bit worried," Mori said in a recent 
interview. "But I trusted NASA (the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration), because space development is the American frontier." 
</P>
<P>
The delay has resulted in an embarrassing development for Japan's official 
space program. Instead of Mori, the first Japanese in space is likely to be a 
television journalist whose company paid a substantial sum of money for a berth 
aboard the Soviet space station Mir. That space mission-cum-publicity stunt is 
scheduled for December. 
</P>
<P>
But Mori will be the first professional astronaut, Japan's first space hero -- 
the "right stuff" role model that has long been missing for Japanese youth. 
</P>
<P>
Mori, a native of the rural northern island of Hokkaido, went to Australia in 
the early 1970s to study physics at South Australia State Flinders University, 
where he received a doctorate in 1976. He returned to teach at Hokkaido 
University and was an associate professor there in nuclear engineering in 1985 
when he noticed a NASDA advertisement in the newspaper -- "Wanted: Astronaut." 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw that ad," Mori recalled excitedly, "I said 'Oh, this is the job for 
me!' " 
</P>
<P>
It was not the first thought he had given to space travel. Mori said he began 
dreaming of the voyage in 1963, when, as a first-year high school student, he 
went camping in a remote northeastern area of Hokkaido to view a total eclipse 
of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very strange feeling when the eclipse took place -- suddenly a cool 
breeze started blowing, and I still can hear the crows crying as they flew back 
to their nests," Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the eclipse was over, the sun shined like a brilliant diamond, and 
I had this joyous feeling," he recalled. "I wasn't sure why I felt that way, 
but later on I thought about it and realized it was because all us creatures on 
Earth depend on the sun for our existence. I decided I wanted to go into space 
and see the sun directly." 
</P>
<P>
Later, specializing in nuclear fission and surface physics at Hokkaido 
University, Mori set out to simulate space conditions inside a laboratory 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Mori's shuttle mission is to conduct a set of 34 Japanese-designed 
materials-processing experiments. The research, dubbed "Fuwatto" after a 
Japanese expression suggesting the floating qualities of weightlessness, will 
set the stage for further experiments in a Japanese module to be attached to 
the U.S. space station, to be launched later in the decade with cooperation 
from space agencies in Europe, Canada and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Mori sees Japan pursuing its own, independent manned space program. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not talking about a space race -- this shouldn't be a matter of 
competition," Mori said. "But the Challenger accident is a good example of how 
other countries should have alternative launching capabilities. If Japan had a 
launch vehicle, there might have been no delay in space development." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese scientists in NASDA and its sister agency under the Education Ministry 
are gradually getting increased funding to undertake an ambitious space program 
that begins with an orientation toward launching commercial and research 
satellites but eventually may lead to space planes like the American shuttle 
and to Japan's own space station. 
</P>
<P>
Some visionaries see the day when Japan will operate package tours to resort 
hotels on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have started much earlier," Mori said. "But still, it's not too 
late." 
</P>
<P>
Mori and his two backup payload specialists -- Dr. Chiaki Mukai, 37, a 
cardiovascular surgeon who may someday become Japan's first woman in space, and 
Takao Doi, 35, an aerospace engineer -- have now begun a year's additional 
training in the United States, mostly at Houston's Johnson Space Center.

RAP'S PRINCE SOON TO BE TV ROYALTY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Will Smith, a 21-year-old rapper who calls himself the Fresh Prince, just got a 
job with NBC. What is expected of him, as implied by his boss, NBC 
Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff, are three things: 
</P>
<P>
* To bring the black street world of hip-hop to American TV audiences. 
</P>
<P>
* To star in a sitcom bearing his name that will be the network's first 
"hit-the-ground-running hit" since "The Golden Girls" five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
* To be a "big, breakout star" along the lines of, oh, say Eddie Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
"Brandon Tartikoff is making me nervous, comparing me to Eddie Murphy and stuff 
like that," Smith said not long after Tartikoff made the comments. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, hey, slow down a little bit." He chuckled. "Let me practice first. This 
has all happened so fast my head's spinning a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air" is backed by first-time TV producer Quincy Jones. 
It's about a funky byproduct of Philadelphia's gang-infested streets who is 
sent out West to live with his wealthy upper-crust cousins, whose plush 
lifestyle has buried their black roots. 
</P>
<P>
Smith quickly points out that the sitcom "is not about rapping. It took me a 
while to make NBC understand -- and they understand now -- they don't want rap. 
They think they want rap performers, but no. What they want is a hip show. 
</P>
<P>
"Rap music -- which a lot of white America doesn't understand -- rap music is 
not just a music. Rap music is a subculture: hip-hop. It's a style of dress, an 
attitude, a look, a language. It's more than just music." 
</P>
<P>
A middle-class kid from Philadelphia who never acted before, Smith is being 
asked to shoulder a load that might wobble the knees of Murphy himself. He's 
network television's first embodiment of a fresh generation. He's a prime-time 
tap into the urban street market, which is pumping rap music, loud new fashions 
and an Afrocentric political consciousness into mainstream society faster than 
the booming bass tracks of a def jam. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Littlefield, Tartikoff's right-hand man at NBC, said that the network 
had been searching for a way to catch the rap tiger by the tail for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all looking at Newsweek and Time and seeing these cover stories (about 
rap music)," he explained. "I was personally watching 'Yo! MTV Raps' and 
feeling waves of something new and contemporary running through various streams 
of culture in America. We felt there was a drum beat going on out there, and we 
looked at our development (schedule) and said, 'It's not represented.' " 
</P>
<P>
Smith, half of D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, endeared himself to kids 
everywhere in 1988 with the sympathetic rap hit "Parents Just Don't 
Understand," about a shopping trip he takes with his mother for back-to-school 
clothes. Although the duo's record sales have slipped since then, the 
bubble-gum rappers are still hopping. Their 900-number hotline, which will be 
used to promote an upcoming album, has set a music industry precedent by 
grossing a reported $10 million since its debut two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Will's a star," said Jones, a celebrated music producer/composer with 
19 Grammys to his credit. "He really makes it pop. He's got this sense of 
timing that's unbelievable. Right now he's not even thinking about it; he's 
just doing his own thing. He's going to be dangerous when he finds out where 
the cameras are. " 
</P>
<P>
The real-life inspiration for "Fresh Prince" came from co-producer Benny 
Medina. "It was partially based upon the way I was brought up, a juxtaposition 
I was thrown into at an early age," Medina said. "I came from a broken home in 
Watts, and I was in and out of juvenile detention facilities and foster homes." 
</P>
<P>
Medina was living at St. Elmo Village, a community home center in Los Angeles, 
when Jack Elliot, a white TV and film composer living in Beverly Hills with a 
wife and three kids, decided to give Medina a chance. "They let me move in with 
them," he said. "I fixed up their garage in the back of the house and became 
part of the family. The deal was I had to keep a job, keep the grades up and be 
respectful of household rules." 
</P>
<P>
Medina wound up at Beverly Hills High School with the children of Motown 
kingpin Berry Gordy and eventually started working for Gordy as a junior 
executive at Motown. Today, Medina is head of black music at Warner Bros. 
Recently, when he and partner Jeff Pollack began developing TV projects, 
including an animated series called "Hip-Hop Junior High," Medina was thinking 
back to his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
Medina met Smith in December backstage at "The Arsenio Hall Show," which was 
celebrating Jones' acclaimed comeback album "Back on the Block." Smith asked 
Medina for directions to a Laker game. Not long after, Pollack began hearing 
secondhand raves about Smith after the rapper's performance on Disney's 
35th-anniversary TV special for NBC. Director John Landis cast Smith in the 
special based on his energetic performance in the music video for "Parents Just 
Don't Understand." 
</P>
<P>
Medina and Pollack contacted Smith, who hooked into the project immediately. 
"It was real," Smith said. "That's what everyone's missing on TV. You've 
probably seen that Tide commercial where the kid stands up on the washing 
machine and starts rapping, 'Mom my clothes are dirty/Gotta get some Tide/Go 
get some.' America needs to see that there are intelligent, articulate black 
people, and what better place to see them than on television?" 
</P>
<P>
The producers took their idea to Quincy Jones, who they knew was meeting with 
NBC to develop TV projects of his own for Warner Communications. "I'm not a big 
fan of TV at all," said Jones, who is also working on a syndicated talk show 
with Jesse Jackson, which will air on KCAL-TV Channel 9 this fall. "But blacks 
have been repressed on TV for so long. When I was young, there was nothing on 
the radio for blacks. It was like black people didn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
"Now there's such a vibrant new culture, in all its different hues, that has 
never been dealt with before. Everyone always thought of blacks in a 
sharecropper situation. A white person isolated in Iowa sees blacks on the TV 
set and thinks that's what black people are like, and they're always wrong. I 
want to change that." 
</P>
<P>
"Fresh Prince" was in line with NBC's fall goal of more youth-oriented 
programming. But by this time it was mid-March -- late to get a new fall show 
going -- and there was no script, no cast and no Fresh Prince. Their future 
star was in Indiana on a concert tour. 
</P>
<P>
NBC wanted to see Smith -- "Now!" -- to find out if he could act. So he 
traveled 17 hours by bus and plane to make it to Los Angeles. A screen test was 
arranged at Jones' home on his 57th birthday, the same night he received a 
lifetime achievement award from "Soul Train." 
</P>
<P>
Smith emerged from an upstairs bedroom, where he was studying a scene from an 
old sitcom pilot that was developed for singer Morris Day. NBC's Littlefield 
described the scene: "You gotta know, if you're a network programmer and it's 
late in the pilot season and you're looking for a hit show, my heart starts to 
pound at this point. Will says, 'OK, so I'm just going to, like, read this 
scene, huh? Now, who are the guys from the network?' 
</P>
<P>
"Then he did a couple of little scenes from this failed sitcom script, and he 
just hit it. If he's a ball player, he hit a home run. We stood up, hugged him. 
I kissed Quincy and said, 'Thank you. Let's go to work.' "

POLITICS: POLLS SHOW THAT SOME OUTRAGE OVER WATERGATE AND RICHARD NIXON IS

<TEXT>
<P>
Maja Tillman curled up in a chair at the Richard M. Nixon archives here, put on 
a set of bulky headphones and braced herself for the Smoking Gun. Suddenly, it 
was June 23, 1972, and the President of the United States was about to obstruct 
justice with his chief aide, H. R. Haldeman. 
</P>
<P>
With a puzzled look on her face, Tillman listened to a secret White House tape 
made six days after the Watergate break-in. The 16-year-old Crenshaw High 
student, who was born the year Nixon resigned the presidency, heard him approve 
a plan to block an FBI investigation of the crime: 
</P>
<P>
Haldeman: " . . . the FBI is not under control . . . their investigation is now 
leading into some productive areas. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Nixon: ". . . just say this is a comedy of errors, without getting into it. . . 
. They should call the FBI in and don't go any further into this case, period!" 
</P>
<P>
When it became public in 1974, the so-called "smoking gun" tape was the key 
piece of evidence that forced a vote on impeachment and caused Nixon to step 
down. But to judge from Tillman's reaction, it was no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that much about Nixon, nobody talks about him these days," she 
said, after a tour of the archive last week with 14 other students. "He 
shouldn't have done all of those things, that wasn't right. But I don't know, 
it really was a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
What about the California Republican's other legacies, like the historic 
opening of U.S. relations with China? Tillman, a bright teen-ager who might be 
mistaken for Whoopi Goldberg's kid sister, frowned and shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I heard something about that," she said. "I guess that was a good 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Because she is so young, Tillman can hardly be expected to dwell on details 
about the Nixon years. But she is not alone. There seems to be a shift in 
sentiment about the 37th President these days that includes people of all ages. 
It's a fogging of memory, a grudging forgiveness and a dimming of outrage that 
would have seemed inconceivable during Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
The new mood of charity will reach a peak this week, when Nixon's privately run 
museum opens in Yorba Linda. President George Bush, the Nixon family and former 
Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan are expected to attend. A spokesman 
says the facility will help "clear the air" and put the 77-year-old former 
President's accomplishments in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, millions of Americans will never forgive or forget. When liberal 
New York journalist Jack Newfield boarded a shuttle flight to Washington 
several years ago, he was startled to find the former President quietly sitting 
behind him. Almost by reflex, he blurted out: "When did you get out of the 
can?" Nixon's security guards quickly put an end to the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
But even Newfield concedes that the political winds may be shifting. For a 
variety of reasons -- ranging from historical amnesia to an enduring 
fascination with the man -- some Americans are taking a second look at a public 
figure who was all but washed up 16 years ago. Some journalists who once 
scorned him in exile at San Clemente now treat him like an Elder Statesman in 
his Saddle River, N.J., home. Like it or not, he's tanned, rested and won't go 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Public opinion polls tell much of the story. In 1977, 75% of the people in a 
Gallup survey said Nixon had obstructed justice; a similar number said he lied 
during a David Frost television interview. In a 1979 poll, he was listed as one 
of America's 10 most disliked persons. 
</P>
<P>
But by 1986, 54% said in a Newsweek poll that Ford was right to pardon Nixon. 
More important, almost 40% said they would like to see him in a public role, as 
an ambassador or presidential adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"People have tried to shove Nixon into a coffin and drive a silver stake 
through his heart, but they just can't do it," says Jim McClellan, a Virginia 
history teacher who escorted Tillman's group through the Nixon archives. "I 
think every generation has to learn and relearn the lessons of Watergate. But 
this man is really something else. He keeps bouncing back in public opinion, 
just when you think he's down and out forever." 
</P>
<P>
The Be Kind to Nixon bandwagon has picked up support in unlikely places. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a three-day conference on his Administration at Hofstra University in 
New York produced polite indifference among students when it came to Watergate. 
Co-ed Roberta Franco said all she knew about Nixon was in the film, "All the 
President's Men," adding that "nobody really cares anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former critics seem to be mellowing. Author Joe McGinniss, who wrote 
a scathing expose of Nixon's campaign in "The Selling of the President 1968," 
says he has trouble explaining Watergate to his 19-year-old son, even though 
the nation was threatened with a constitutional crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of Nixon's resignation, 11 of his aides were found guilty of 
Watergate-related crimes. Haldeman, domestic adviser John Ehrlichman and former 
Atty. Gen. John Mitchell were indicted on charges including conspiracy, 
obstruction of justice and lying under oath. Each was sentenced to a prison 
term of 2 1/2 to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
But it might just as well be ancient history to some people. 
</P>
<P>
"My son will tell me that nobody died at Watergate, it's not like the Vietnam 
War," McGinniss says. "And I myself have trouble getting worked up over it like 
I once did. On a scale of one to 10, in view of things which have happened 
since, how important was it?" 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1974, the tiny town of Thetford, Vt., became the first political body 
in America to officially call for Nixon's impeachment. Bernard Benn, an 
architect who spoke in favor of the resolution at a community meeting in the 
high school gym, says his views have eased since then. 
</P>
<P>
"Nixon did some good things, you know, and I think his historical image over 
time will heal," Benn says. "I'm no fan of his, but I miss not having him to 
kick around anymore. You know, people tend to forget a lot about him." 
</P>
<P>
Since he left the White House, Nixon has been hoping -- expecting, even -- that 
Watergate and its horrors will be forgotten. Somehow, he has said, Americans 
will focus on his larger achievements in foreign policy and forget the two-year 
political scandal that brought him down. 
</P>
<P>
Just as he did after losing the presidency in 1960 and the California 
governor's race in 1962, Nixon has staged his latest comeback with tenacity and 
skill. Much of it has been a media production, with television interviews, 
newspaper Op-ed pieces, best-selling books and speeches to VIP audiences. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, the public has caught glimpses of a more relaxed Nixon. He was 
doused with champagne in the California Angels' locker room after they clinched 
the pennant in 1979. The former President made a surprise appearance on a 
recent New York Mets baseball broadcast and caused a stir several years ago 
when he dined in a Burger King on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
More important, he has plunged back into the political arena. Nixon lobbied 
Congress in January to sustain Bush's veto of a bill giving permanent U. S. 
sanctuary to Chinese students. Last year, he sternly lectured Chinese officials 
in Beijing about the massacre at Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, Nixon has tried to put a gracious, statesmanlike spin on his remarks. 
But quite often the old partisan warrior comes booming through. 
</P>
<P>
"History will treat me fairly," he said in a 1988 television interview. 
"Historians probably won't. Because most historians are on the left." 
</P>
<P>
The jury is still out on whether Nixon will succeed. However, even his worst 
critics concede that the former President's rehabilitation will take a giant 
step forward this week when his museum opens in Southern California. Curators 
say the facility will contain papers and memorabilia mostly from before and 
after Nixon's presidency. The bulk of his presidential papers, including the 
Watergate tapes, are kept in federal archives in Alexandria, Va., as a result 
of legislation passed shortly after he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Congress was wary that key documents might be tampered with, if they were 
handed over to Nixon. The materials are kept in a warehouse that includes 44 
million pages of papers and a room where scholars and tourists can listen to 12 
of the tapes that were used as evidence in the Watergate trials. 
</P>
<P>
But the majority are still unavailable, because Nixon has contested their 
release. It is a messy affair, with no legal resolution in sight. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no such clouds, however, over the Orange County festivities. The 
mood is upbeat, and sponsors hope the site will one day be a tourist attraction 
just like Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
"These events in Yorba Linda may signify the final recovery and rehabilitation 
of Richard Nixon, at least in his own mind," says historian Stephen Ambrose, 
who is completing a three-volume biography of the former President. "It's been 
a pretty remarkable effort on his part." 
</P>
<P>
How did it happen? Don't look for clues in Nixon himself. Most historians who 
have studied his career believe he is unchanged from the tough, red-baiting 
politician who won a Whittier congressional seat in 1946 and made headlines 
with his bare-knuckled attacks on leading Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Nixon's beliefs seem to have hardened over the years. In his most 
recent memoir, "In the Arena," he still insists that the Vietnam War could have 
been won and blames Congress for abandoning a worthy American cause. The man 
who once called student protesters "bums" continues to take shots at the 
counterculture, saying the Woodstock music festival's only significant legacy 
was "the glorification of dangerous, illegal drugs." 
</P>
<P>
More to the point, he still denies committing any crimes in the Watergate 
affair. Nixon insists he was only guilty of poor judgment and failing to set 
the proper ethical tone for his subordinates. He accepts responsibility for 
what happened, and says his secret effort to block the FBI investigation of the 
scandal was "an inexcusable error." 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, he flails at one "myth" after another, blaming the 
press, blaming his political enemies, blaming his staff and sounding very much 
like the man who denied all wrongdoing up until the bitter end. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still the same old Dick Nixon," Ambrose says. "So if you're wondering why 
this comeback is possible, you might say the secret lies more in the American 
people themselves. This nation was just dying to forgive Richard Nixon . . . to 
give him a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Kutler, a University of Wisconsin historian who wrote "The Wars of 
Watergate," a harsh critique of Nixon, says the former President is waging his 
last and most important campaign -- this time for the soul of history. 
</P>
<P>
"He's shameless," Kutler said. "In spite of everything that's happened, he 
never really left the scene. And the worst thing is, he's busy rewriting the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
Some observers believe that Nixon began planning his comeback only days after 
he left Washington in disgrace. At the time, the former President faced 
mountains of legal bills and feared that he would be forced to stand trial. He 
was shunned by Republican leaders and nearly died in a bout with phlebitis. 
</P>
<P>
But there was one bright spot: Literary agent Irving Paul "Swifty" Lazar 
traveled to Nixon's San Clemente home and pledged to get him a $2-million 
advance for his memoirs. The only proviso was that he had to make a full 
accounting of Watergate -- a condition to which he readily agreed. 
</P>
<P>
When it appeared, the book was criticized by some reviewers for the President's 
continuing denials. But as he wrote in the second sentence, "memory is fallible 
and inevitably selective." 
</P>
<P>
The comeback had begun. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, Nixon was paid $500,000 to appear in a series of television 
interviews with Frost. Asked about political dirty tricks, he made his famous 
comment that, "When the President does it, that means that it is not illegal." 
Public opinion was still negative, but a poll taken after the shows suggested 
that 44% now had a more sympathetic opinion of him. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Nixon began appearing in other carefully chosen forums, such as a GOP 
event in a small Kentucky town and a debate at Oxford University. He made a 
triumphant trip to China, the scene of his greatest foreign policy success. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the former President began giving Reagan confidential advice on the 
Soviets. The ultimate irony came in 1984, when he got a standing ovation from 
the American Society of Newspaper Editors in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the resurgence is in full gear. Nixon's latest memoir, "In the Arena," 
was on the New York Times best-seller list for more than 10 weeks. He recently 
appeared on the "Today Show," gave a 90-minute interview to PBS and talked 
about his life since 1974 on Larry King's television show. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there is even talk among some GOP consultants that, given the right 
political climate, he might address the Republican Convention in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We've reached a juncture where even the press can give him a rousing welcome," 
Kutler says. "Doesn't anybody remember anything?" 
</P>
<P>
But that's precisely the point. To paraphrase P. T. Barnum, nobody ever went 
broke underestimating the short attention span of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Stone, a Washington political consultant who is close to Nixon, believes 
the former President has an uncanny sense of timing: "He always knew, I think, 
that many years down the line, people simply wouldn't remember or care so much 
about Watergate. Richard Nixon understands the American people and what makes 
them tick better than anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Iran-Contra. The Hostage Crisis. AIDS. Earthquakes. Who has time to remember 
Watergate when so much information is thrown at people every day? John 
Petrocik, a political science professor at UCLA, says he is personally amazed 
that Nixon could be creeping back into respectability. But on another level, 
it's no surprise at all. 
</P>
<P>
"The half-life of public memory on these things is very short in our culture," 
he notes. "The electorate is not very politicized, as a rule, and they really 
don't have any enduring ideologies about this. Unless people are constantly 
reminded of Nixon's sins, they'll forget. 
</P>
<P>
"You also have to remember that nearly 45% of the voters were under the age of 
18 when he resigned. So they have no direct experience with him." 
</P>
<P>
What people do remember may also be helping Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to his successors, Ford, Carter and Reagan, the former President looks 
better and better, knowledgeable observers say. 
</P>
<P>
"Reagan was so lacking in even elemental knowledge about foreign and national 
policy that, when Nixon began speaking out, it was a reminder to people that he 
was vastly more intelligent," says George McGovern, who lost to Nixon in the 
1972 presidential election. "I don't think he'll ever escape the taint of 
Watergate. But that contrast with Reagan made many people think that he was 
smart, tough and wise." 
</P>
<P>
These days, Nixon's expertise in foreign policy is the key to his commercial 
success, according to Michael Korda, editor-in-chief at Simon &amp; Schuster. 
The strong sales of "In the Arena" suggest that his stature is greater than 
other living former Presidents, says Korda, who edited the book. 
</P>
<P>
The former chief executive, Korda contends, "never skirts the issues, and his 
public image is growing all the time. I don't see anybody beating a path to 
Ford or Carter's door to ask for advice about what to do with Hungary or 
Russia. But they do with him." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, these attitudes have kindled a fierce debate over Nixon's 
record. In 1968, Joan Wilson was a history student at UC Berkeley who had 
little respect for the newly elected President. She had voted for Black Panther 
leader Eldridge Cleaver and bitterly opposed the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Wilson is a professor at Indiana University who will soon publish "Nixon 
Without Watergate," one of the first revisionist histories of his presidency. 
If Americans look beyond the scandal, she says, Nixon emerges as a surprisingly 
moderate President on issues such as education, welfare, hunger and the 
environment. Someone the liberals might even enjoy having around. 
</P>
<P>
"I have trouble discussing this unemotionally with my colleagues, because most 
of them are still dancing on Nixon's grave back in 1974," she says. "There's a 
generational hatred of this man, among a very powerful group of people. But 
when we all die and pass from the scene, a new generation will be more 
receptive to him. It's time to look beyond the haze of Watergate." 
</P>
<P>
Hogwash, says Ambrose: "Nixon without Watergate is an absurd proposition. It's 
like Macbeth without the murder. You can't have that. It was a crime and it 
won't be forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
James David Barber, a political science professor at Duke University, goes 
further, saying Nixon's drive for rehabilitation reflects the dangerous belief 
that Americans will forgive anything. 
</P>
<P>
"We're supposed to think that, because someone makes a big mistake and barely 
says they're sorry, we can start all over again with them," he says. "But that 
little game is not what we need when it comes to history." 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam generates the same fireworks. In his books, Nixon continues to say that 
Congress should never have pulled the plug on aid to South Vietnam. One 
consequence, he writes, is that communist guerrillas overran Cambodia: "Any 
doubts about the justice of our cause should have been removed by what has 
happened since we left. When the communist Khmer Rouge came to power in 
Cambodia, they killed or starved to death 2 million people." 
</P>
<P>
Not so fast, answer a host of Cambodian experts. They point out that Nixon's 
secret bombing and 1970 invasion of that neutral country forced it into the 
war. In the ensuing chaos, Pol Pot's victory was made easier. 
</P>
<P>
Although the North Vietnamese were also to blame, Nixon "helped to destroy my 
country," asserts Dith Pran, the Cambodian holocaust survivor whose life was 
portrayed in the award-winning film, "The Killing Fields." 
</P>
<P>
"His bombing and invasion were terrible things that no Cambodian can ever 
forget," Dith Pran says. "I hope Americans don't forget either." 
</P>
<P>
But forgetting is something America tried to do after the Vietnam War. It took 
years before the trauma began to ease and people could objectively re-examine 
the conflict. So it has been with Nixon, says McGinniss: "Ten years ago, an 
editor suggested to me that I do a book about Nixon, and I laughed, I thought 
we were all up to here with him. But I was wrong. Now, the cycle is to go back 
and take another look." 
</P>
<P>
For some, the man with the 5 o'clock shadow never lost his allure. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go to the Elks Club these days, I still hear affection for the guy," 
says Tony Ulasewicz, a tough-talking New York cop who once delivered money in 
paper bags from Nixon's election fund to the Watergate burglars. "Time heals 
all wounds, you know? People like me always stand up for him. We're not flag 
burners. With us, it's, 'My President, right or wrong.' " 
</P>
<P>
Many Americans might disagree. In the end, Nixon's re-emergence may be simply 
attributable to the nation's continuing fascination with his character. In four 
years, he will have straddled half a century of American life. People have 
grown up hating or loving him; they find him hard to dismiss. 
</P>
<P>
How, then, will history judge Nixon? 
</P>
<P>
Much depends on how future generations are taught, says former California Gov. 
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, who beat Nixon in the 1962 gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
But let's make one thing perfectly clear: The man who vowed he was giving his 
last press conference after that election will never quite fade away. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no one person in the last 50 years who has been up and down so much. 
He's always fighting back and never accepts defeat," Brown says. 
</P>
<P>
"I never liked the man much, I'm one of his most severe critics, to tell you 
the truth. But I think that when they finally add up what he's done, there will 
be more pluses than minuses."

EX-AFL STAR KEMP RETAINS HIGH PROFILE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: FORMER MVP QUARTERBACK FOR THE BUFFALO BILLS IS SECRETARY OF HOUSING 
AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Kemp, the highest ranking AFL graduate, works in a downtown office 
building that is a brisk limousine ride from the White House, and even farther 
from many other federal buildings. 
</P>
<P>
From his office on the 10th floor, Kemp, still lean and fit, commands only a 
far view of the Potomac River. But he keeps a close watch over this and other 
cities as the Bush Administration's secretary of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 30 years since he was an AFL original. A quarterback, Kemp joined 
the San Diego Chargers at the beginning of their first season, which they 
played in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The (AFL) made a huge impact on my family, on my career and on me," he said 
recently, noting that his two sons are quarterbacks, Jeff with the Seattle 
Seahawks and Jimmy as a redshirt freshman at Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
As a veteran of all 10 years of the AFL, Kemp, who made all-league three times, 
was that league's only quarterback starter on both its first and last days -- 
in '60 and '69. 
</P>
<P>
In his peak season, '65, after leading the Bills to their second consecutive 
AFL championship, he was voted the AFL's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
That was 12 months before the first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"The AFL was fun, and it was a career steppingstone for me," Kemp said. "Two 
months after my last game (in the AFL Pro Bowl), I announced for Congress." 
</P>
<P>
From 1962 until he ran for the Presidency 26 years later, Kemp represented 
Buffalo either on the field or in Congress, and his campaign committee is 
confident that he will succeed Bush in '96. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, he remains indebted to AFL founder Lamar Hunt, whose league made him a 
household name. 
</P>
<P>
"My first three pro years were in the NFL (in the 1950s), when I played behind 
Bobby Layne, Tobin Rote, Chuck Conerly, Y.A. Tittle, Earl Morrall and John 
Brodie," Kemp said. "So I did a lot of sitting around. 
</P>
<P>
"The great achievement of the AFL was the opportunity it made for hundreds of 
additional football players to play pro, including me. There were only 12 NFL 
teams in 1959. The AFL opened up (the NFL's) closed society and doubled the 
number of pro clubs and players." 
</P>
<P>
As its other achievement, the AFL markedly improved the NFL's caliber of 
football, in Kemp's view. 
</P>
<P>
"We threw the ball a lot in the AFL, and that made for more scoring," he said. 
"Sid Gillman and Al Davis changed the NFL by what they did in the AFL. When the 
merger came, the AFL was the stronger league." 
</P>
<P>
It was stronger, in part, because the Bills found a Hall of Fame running back 
in the 1969 common draft. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed the entire 1968 season after (teammate) Ron McDole fell on my knee in 
a preseason drill," Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
"And that year, the Bills finished (1-12-1)." 
</P>
<P>
That was the worst record in either league, enabling the Bills to draft the 
nation's No.1 player: USC's O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
"O.J. has never forgiven me," Kemp said.

"The question is whether we're going to stand for equality, for decency, for

1969." -- George McGovern Democratic nominee for President, 1972

"No one in the Nixon Administration profited from Watergate. No one ripped off 
the government, as in previous scandals. Wrongdoing took place, but not for 
personal gain. All Administrations have sought to protect themselves from the 
political fallout of scandals. In retrospect, I would say that Watergate was 
one part wrongdoing, one part blundering and one part political vendetta by my 
enemies." -- Nixon from "In the Arena," 1990

"As our plane circled the El Toro Marine Base on the afternoon of Aug. 9, I

continue to fight for the great causes of peace, freedom and opportunity." -- 
Nixon "In the Arena," 1990

"I was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing
