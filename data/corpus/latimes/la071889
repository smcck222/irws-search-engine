A suspected Irish Republican Army bomb squad apparently preparing to attack 
British targets in West Germany has been arrested in France, police said. Two 
men and one woman, who were not identified, were seized at a toll booth on the 
highway east of Paris on Friday, while British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, President Bush and other world leaders were visiting the French 
capital for the economic summit. Police said the three, at least two of whom 
were of British nationality, were carrying detonators and false identity 
papers. IRA guerrilla units have carried out a number of recent attacks on 
British military bases in West Germany.

The Office of Management and Budget plans to forecast today that Congress is on 
target to satisfy the $110-billion Gramm-Rudman law deficit target for the 
coming fiscal year, congressional sources said. The officials, who asked to not 
be identified, said that by the government's updated calculations, the deficit 
for the 1990 fiscal year -- which begins Oct. 1 -- would be about $99.5 
billion. Even if $5.7 billion in income from planned sales of federal assets is 
not included -- and it cannot be counted under Gramm-Rudman procedures -- the 
deficit would be $105.2 billion, still well within the law's limit. Because of 
disagreements between the Administration and Congress, few people expect the 
assets to be sold. If the government projects that the $110-billion shortfall 
target will be surpassed, Gramm-Rudman automatically triggers spending cuts.

European Community foreign ministers agreed to send emergency food aid to 
Poland pending a wider international effort to tackle structural problems of 
food supply there. The 12 ministers were responding to the decision at the 
Paris summit by the seven leading industrialized democracies to ask the 
European Community to coordinate help for economic reforms in Poland and 
Hungary. A preparatory meeting of officials of the 12 community governments 
will be held soon to prepare a conference to examine ways to help Polish 
agriculture overcome problems causing chronic shortages.

Syrian gunboats seized a ship carrying vegetables to the blockaded Christian 
enclave in Beirut and escorted it to the Syrian-controlled port of Tripoli in 
northern Lebanon, a spokesman for the Christians' army commander, Maj. Gen. 
Michel Aoun, said. He said the Syrians intercepted the ship about 15 miles off 
the Christian port of Juniyah. In Tel Aviv, meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun, 
commander of the Israeli air force, said Israel will not intervene to prevent 
Iraq from delivering short-range missiles to Christian forces in Lebanon.

Delivery drivers and warehouse workers at Laura Scudder's distribution centers 
in Northern California went on strike after negotiations over a new three-year 
contract collapsed. About 220 workers set up picket lines outside 15 of the 
snack-food manufacturer's facilities from Visalia to the Oregon border and from 
San Francisco to Reno, said Le Roy Salido, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters 
Local 588 in Hayward. "It won't be a short strike because of the issues 
involved," Salido said. The 2-month-old talks derailed in Pleasanton when 
management offered a contract that would have taken away union benefits, Salido 
said. Management's proposal would have frozen workers' salaries and pension 
benefits, instituted a split workweek, and lowered drivers' commissions on 
sales by 6%, Salido said. Company officials were unavailable.

As many as 30 Afghan rebel military leaders, including more than half a dozen 
senior commanders, were ambushed and killed by a rival guerrilla group while 
returning from a strategy meeting in northern Afghanistan last week, rebel 
sources and Western diplomats confirmed in Islamabad, Pakistan. The killings, 
the most serious internecine violence reported among the U.S.-backed rebels in 
years, occurred about 200 miles north of Kabul, the capital, after a meeting of 
rebel leaders to plan renewed assaults against the Soviet-supported Afghan 
government. Rebel sources charged that the ambushes were ordered by a commander 
associated with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader of the most anti-Western guerrilla 
faction.

Landing on the moon was child's play as astronaut Michael Collins led 
schoolchildren on a simulated space trip, commemorating the 20th anniversary of 
man's first steps on the lunar surface. Collins and students from Prince 
George's County, Md., schools were linked by television satellite to a mock-up 
mission control manned by astronaut Charles Duke and students at the Houston 
Museum of Natural History in Texas. Duke was the "capcom," or capsule 
communicator, when Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. set foot on 
the moon July 20, 1969. Collins, the Apollo 11 command module pilot, orbited 
the moon while his crew mates romped on the lunar surface. During the 
simulation at a high-tech science education center in Greenbelt, Md., Collins 
and the students used computers to gather moon rocks, build and launch a space 
probe, analyze lunar samples, monitor life support systems and operate robots 
and lunar rovers. "They had a good landing. They're a team of real 
professionals," Collins said of the students. "We're ready to hire them."

 -- This time it's personal for Richard M. Nixon. For the first time, the 
former President will describe in detail his experiences in resigning the 
presidency and his life in retirement in an autobiography due next spring. "It 
is the most personal book I have ever written," Nixon, 76, said in a statement. 
Simon &amp; Schuster, the publisher, would not disclose terms of the contract 
but said it plans a first printing of at least 200,000 and a major marketing 
campaign. Nixon has pledged his income from the book to the Nixon Library and 
Birthplace, scheduled to open next year at Yorba Linda, Calif.

 -- Seventy years after the death of Nicholas II, about 200 people gathered in 
a monastery graveyard in Moscow to hold the first public Requiem in the Soviet 
Union for the czar who was shot, along with his family, by Bolshevik guards in 
July, 1918. Worshipers defied repeated orders by police to leave the prayer 
meeting conducted by Russian Orthodox priests at Donskoi Monastery. The 
unofficial Commission on the Remains of the Russian Imperial is calling for the 
remains of the royal family to be given Christian burials in the Peter and Paul 
Fortress in Leningrad, traditional resting place for Romanov royalty, Vladimir 
Anishchenko, a commission member, said. Monarchists have contacted Grand Prince 
Vladimir Kirillovich, ranking member of the Romanov family, who lives in 
England. "He just came back to life when he heard about our activity," 
Anishchenko said. SHIRLEY MARLOW

The Senate Ethics Committee was formally asked to investigate Sen. Alfonse M. 
D'Amato (R-N.Y.) for a "pattern of exploiting" his office to benefit campaign 
contributors and friends. The request for an investigation was made by Mark 
Green, a Democrat, who was decisively beaten by D'Amato in the 1986 senatorial 
election. Green said his complaint is based on news stories. In a statement, 
D'Amato said the request is "a blatant campaign document." Under Senate 
regulations, anyone can file a complaint with the ethics panel, which then 
decides whether it warrants investigation.

A retired colonel testifying in the spy trial of a Turkish man said a U.S. 
soldier accused in the case attracted attention at an Army base in Germany by 
buying an expensive car for cash. Retired Col. Kenneth Roney's testimony came 
on the opening day of the U.S. District Court trial in Savannah, Ga., of 
Huseyin Yildirim, 61, who is accused of scheming with Army Warrant Officer 
James W. Hall III to provide military secrets to the Soviets and East Germans. 
Hall, 30, was court-martialed in March, and pleaded guilty to 10 counts of 
espionage, attempted espionage and failing to obey Army regulations. Yildirim, 
who worked as a mechanic on an Army base in Berlin, is charged with conspiring 
to provide classified information.

Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski asked Congress to create a 
commission to conduct the first review of veterans health care in 25 years and 
make a "take-it-or-leave-it" recommendation. Derwinski carefully excluded the 
possibility of hospital closings, talking only of "changing missions" and the 
like. The commission would be modeled after the one appointed last year that 
recommended the closing of 86 military installations -- meaning its report 
would have to be considered by the secretary and Congress as a package. If 
established by Congress, the commission would examine all 172 Department of 
Veterans Affairs hospitals plus hundreds of clinics and other treatment units 
and would return a proposal by Jan. 1, 1991.

Alaska concluded that poor management by Exxon Shipping Co. is to blame for the 
nation's worst oil spill. "Exxon Shipping's failures and lapses in management 
were so numerous and pervasive that it is a wonder the Exxon Valdez was the 
first tanker grounded," said Robert LeResche, head of the state inquiry into 
the spill. LeResche said in a 110-page report to the National Transportation 
Safety Board that the response to the spill by the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. 
was a failure. The report follows NTSB hearings in Anchorage in May into the 
March 24 spill. The ship spewed 11 million gallons of oil when it hit a reef in 
Prince William Sound.

VALDEZ TANK SAMPLES GO TO LAB; SUIT PUT ON HOLD 
</P>

Samples taken from the tanks of the Exxon Valdez have been sent to an 
independent lab in Sorrento Valley in the hope of determining the makeup and 
toxicity of the milky blue substance that has sporadically discharged from the 
crippled tanker since last Monday, U. S. Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists were expected to finish gathering samples from within 15 of the 
Valdez's tanks by Monday afternoon, the officials said. Analysis of the 
material, earlier found to contain equal parts of weathered crude oil and 
marine life, could take up to a week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state authorities were drawing up written conditions Exxon Co. must 
meet before the Valdez can be moved into state waters for repairs, officials 
said. The negotiations put on hold a lawsuit filed Friday by the state against 
the oil company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Exxon Demonstration 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, more than 2,000 San Diegans demonstrated on Fiesta Island against 
Exxon, forming a replica of the well-known circle with a slash through it, 
around the word Exxon in large, black letters . 
</P>
<P>
"It was something San Diegans seemed really concerned about, so we took some 
action," said Pam Finn, program director for radio station KKYY-FM, which 
sponsored the early-morning protest. "San Diegans care about their environment. 
This was just a forum in which they could show the world that they do care, and 
that they don't want their waters polluted -- that even the slightest amount of 
oil is too much." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Shipping Co. officials called the demonstration "unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
"I think if people know the facts . . . and then made their assessments, I 
think they would choose not to protest," said John Tompkins, the company's 
fleet services manager. 
</P>
<P>
The 987-foot tanker on Monday was 14 miles northeast of Pyramid Cove on San 
Clemente Island, the probable site for removal of large steel plates that are 
dangling from the ship's hull and preventing it from entering San Diego Bay for 
repairs, the Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They said they had not sighted any new discharges from the tanker. However, the 
state Department of Fish and Game reported at about 1 p.m. seeing two new 
sheens -- a brownish slick 1,500 yards long by 200 yards wide and a bluish 
sheen about a mile in diameter -- about 10 miles southwest of the Valdez, in 
what is considered a shipping lane. The Coast Guard, which flew over the area 
after the report, found only the blue sheen, said Lt. Larry Solberg. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not it came from the Valdez is hard to say," he said. "The Coast 
Guard saw only one of them . . . and it was in a normal shipping lane." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dissipating Rapidly 
</P>
<P>
Solberg said that the sheen was dissipating rapidly but that the Coast Guard 
was able to collect a sample of the substance for testing. 
</P>
<P>
The collection of samples from inside the Valdez's tanks is not expected to 
reveal much more than what scientists already know about the discharge, 
officials said. Coast Guard tests confirmed last week that the bluish-brown 
substance leaking from the Valdez contains both very old oil and marine life, 
in about equal parts. But it is unclear how dangerous or toxic the substance 
could be to marine life. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things the state and I would like to know is the potential" of the 
discharge, said Gary Petrae, coordinator of scientific support for the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Assn. Petrae is heading the team of scientists 
gathering samples. "But I would estimate that the extremely toxic and even 
relatively toxic oil residues are gone." 
</P>
<P>
A state Fish and Game official said Saturday, however, that the discharged 
substance could pose serious environmental problems to marine life off San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it's weathered oil, one of the problems in the Prince William 
Sound spill has been the effects on sea otters as the oil has moved through the 
food chain," said Reed Smith, pollution response coordinator for Fish and Game. 
"We feel there is pollution coming off (the Valdez), and that it could have the 
same kind of effect." 
</P>
<P>
The tanker, which was towed from Alaska after hitting a reef and dumping 11 
million gallons of crude oil in Prince William Sound, was scheduled to enter 
San Diego Bay last Tuesday for a nine-month, $25-million repair job at National 
Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., which built the vessel in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Entry Delayed 
</P>
<P>
But the discovery last Monday of dangling steel plates, which were peeled back 
during the 2,200-mile trip, and the discharges believed to be coming from the 
Valdez, have delayed its entry. 
</P>
<P>
The written agreement, expected to be drawn up by state officials late Monday 
or early today, will stipulate certain conditions that must be met before Exxon 
is allowed to move the tanker into state waters to remove the six massive 
plates that were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The plates, at least one of which is hanging about 70 feet from the bottom of 
the ship, prevent the vessel from clearing the bottom of San Diego Bay, where 
it will undergo repairs to the damage incurred in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the written terms are agreed to, there's no need to issue an injunction, 
because the very thing the injunction asked for has been accomplished," said Ed 
Manning, chief environmental counsel to Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, a member of the 
State Lands Commission, which joined the attorney general's office and the 
state Regional Water Quality Control Board in San Diego in filing suit last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The state agencies involved want to make sure all the conditions are taken 
care of, they're in writing and Exxon agrees to them," Manning said. "It's 
there as a safeguard." 
</P>
<P>
The conditions include no discharge of oil from the ship in state waters, which 
extend 3 miles from shore; a 24-hour waiting period between the last discharge 
and the moving of the ship to state waters; a contingency plan for prevention 
and cleanup of further discharges while in state waters; a biological study of 
the removal site before and after the tanker has the plates removed, and full 
liability for all costs incurred by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials are expected to agree to the conditions, which are similar to 
those issued Thursday by Fish and Game Director Pete Bontadelli, state 
officials said.

"Our job is to make the streets safe, and that's what we're going to do," 
O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, seven county officials, one after another, took to the 
microphone at a 55-minute meeting to detail the excessive workloads or crowding 
they face, conditions that Judge Michael I. Greer said were exacerbated by San 
Diego's recent decision to add more than 100 officers as well as Oceanside's 
recent move to add 20 officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are about at breakdown now under the circumstances we were facing without 
the additional police officers," said Greer, presiding judge of the Superior 
Court, who called the press conference. "I think it's time the system stood up 
and told the public that you can't cure these problems with the simple approach 
of hiring more police officers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Our Responsibility' 
</P>
<P>
At another point, Greer said, "I think it's our responsibility to tell the 
public that, if something's not done, if they don't recognize their 
responsibility and allow themselves to be taxed to save their children and 
their families, they're going to be in a very serious situation. I think it's 
very serious." 
</P>
<P>
Greer's pronouncement of doom was echoed, in order, by Sheriff John Duffy, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard J. Neely, Public Defender Frank Bardsley, Chief 
Probation Officer Cecil H. Steppe, Assistant Presiding Judge Judith McConnell 
and Susan Golding, chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Golding conceded it is the county's business to fund the courts and jails but 
urged the cities to help, particularly San Diego, site of most arrests and most 
trials. The county's fiscal year 1990 budget, which began July 1, allots $290 
million, or 20.2% of $1.45 billion, to courts, jails, lawyers, sheriff's and 
probation staffers, said Marilyn Laurence, the judge's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Although Golding and Greer said they want more courts and jails, as well as the 
land and staff for them, they acknowledged that they have no idea how much more 
money that would take. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition A, the half-cent sales tax increase voters countywide approved in 
June, 1988, as a $1.6-billion shot in the arm for new jails and courts over the 
next decade, would give "us a giant start, but it doesn't solve our needs," 
Golding said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the tax is now in effect, a Riverside County judge has declared the 
measure invalid, ruling that it improperly circumvents the tax-limiting 
Proposition 13 approved by California voters in 1978. San Diego County is 
appealing that decision while the money raised by the tax sits in an 
interest-bearing escrow account. 
</P>
<P>
So, Golding said, "The county is simply in the position of asking, not begging, 
for that assistance (from the cities) to solve this problem." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor suggested an alternative. The mayor has been unsuccessfully trying to 
arrange a face-to-face meeting with Gov. George Deukmejian after her surprise 
press conference in late May requesting that the governor declare a "state of 
emergency" and give the city $34 million to fight gang- and drug-related 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, O'Connor said, Greer, Duffy and other county officials could hold a 
press conference in Sacramento and invite Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be most helpful," O'Connor said. "I would appreciate the assistance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In a State of 'Breakdown' 
</P>
<P>
Greer and the six other speakers at the press conference, held in Greer's 
chambers at the county courthouse in downtown San Diego, said the city's 
addition of officers to the current force of 1,705 is sure to add more cases to 
the system, which they variously described as already in a state of 
"breakdown," "meltdown" or "shutdown." 
</P>
<P>
Felony criminal filings in the Superior Court rose 28% in 1988 from 1987, to 
11,988, Greer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of your felony arrests are concentrated in the San Diego police 
jurisdiction," 51% of them in 1988, he said. "All cases that occur in the San 
Diego police jurisdiction must be tried in the downtown courts, cannot be tried 
in outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
"So our court, the Superior Court, is reaching a situation at this time where 
we will be trying nothing but criminal cases until we get more courts. And the 
civil cases will be tried in El Cajon, South Bay and North County, where we 
have room to try those cases, which will create a terrible situation downtown." 
</P>
<P>
In February, Greer postponed all new civil trials for what turned out to be 
three weeks because of an overwhelming backlog of criminal cases. Civil trials 
resumed when Deukmejian appointed seven new judges to the San Diego Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the jam of criminal cases, the county's "fast-track" pilot program, 
designed to speedily resolve civil cases, is threatened, Greer said. Eighteen 
judges assigned to civil duty had to handle 117 criminal trials during the past 
six months, more than five weeks work per judge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The "major" problem in the system, though, is the county's jails, Greer said. 
Duffy agreed, saying that the six county jails are severely crowded and that 
this year's numbers make last year's figures "pale by comparison." 
</P>
<P>
The jails had 3,673 inmates on Jan. 1, 1989. On May 31 they counted 4,519 
prisoners -- an all-time high -- in facilities built for about 1,800, according 
to a chart made available at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who's Not in Jail 
</P>
<P>
"When we talk about having 4,500 people in custody, the real significant thing 
is who's not in jail," Duffy said. "We're required to release virtually all 
misdemeanor arrests, about 45,000 criminals we released to the streets in San 
Diego County last year because there was no room at the jails." 
</P>
<P>
"When you simply add to one portion of that system without adding to other 
portions of that system, it's what's called self-defeating," he said in 
reference to the city's addition of officers. 
</P>
<P>
Neely, the deputy district attorney, said prosecutors' days in trial have 
increased 52% over the past three fiscal years, while staff levels are up only 
15%. 
</P>
<P>
Public Defender Bardsley said funding for his office last year had assumed 
65,000 cases. The actual number turned out to be more like 85,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The probation department is so understaffed, Steppe said, that he sent county 
supervisors a June 21 letter asking for 40 more positions just to keep up with 
pre-sentence reports, projected to be about 21,000 this fiscal year. Another 50 
officers are needed to supervise people already on probation, he said in the 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
At Juvenile Court, a recent survey revealed that the average trial is down to 1 
hour, 53 minutes, said McConnell, who used to be assigned there. Of the eight 
judges, one holds court in what was formerly a cleaning closet and another in 
what was an interview room, she said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FOREST FIRE BLAMED ON DUMPED ASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A brush fire that burned 2,250 acres in the Green Valley and Lake Elizabeth 
areas late last month was caused by a resident who dumped hot ashes from a 
wood-burning stove, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The resident, whom authorities declined to identify, could be charged with a 
misdemeanor for starting a fire by negligence, said Special Agent Wayne Crowder 
of the U.S. Forest Service. "The fire was not intentionally set. We have his 
admission that he had been dumping out hot stove ashes there for quite some 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Crowder said he will interview more potential witnesses before a decision on 
charges is made. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators sent a report on the fire to U.S. Forest Service lawyers in San 
Francisco, who could file a civil suit against the man. 
</P>
<P>
The ashes reportedly were dumped on the morning of June 28, shortly before the 
fire roared northwest through heavy brush in the Angeles National Forest and 
burned for two days. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze began near El Clavelito Road south of the San Francisquito Campground 
in the northwestern part of Green Valley. It destroyed one house and several 
outbuildings.

JURY PONDERS ON LIFE OR DEATH FOR LUCAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury Monday began deciding the punishment of convicted murderer David Lucas, 
but stopped after two hours and will resume its deliberations today. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Superior Court jury is deciding whether Lucas, 34, a carpet 
cleaner from Spring Valley, should be put to death or sentenced to life in 
prison without parole for the murders of two women and a small child. 
</P>
<P>
The jury heard closing arguments Monday in which the prosecutor called Lucas "a 
butcher" who had "a lust for death." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Williams told jurors that Lucas deserves the death 
penalty and said the state of California should abolish it if someone like 
Lucas doesn't merit it. 
</P>
<P>
He urged the jury to get into the "battle between good and evil" by asking that 
someone like Lucas who committed "the ultimate acts of evil" be executed. 
</P>
<P>
"We know this lust for death will sit with Mr. Lucas for the rest of his life," 
said Williams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Executions Described 
</P>
<P>
Responding, Lucas' attorney Steve Feldman urged jurors to spare him and 
described in detail the execution process in San Quentin State Prison. 
</P>
<P>
He said the act of execution, involving Lucas "writhing" for 15 minutes while 
suffocating in the gas chamber, was "more cold-blooded than any of the murders 
Mr. Lucas has been convicted of." 
</P>
<P>
Staring coldly at Williams, the defense attorney urged the jury not to satisfy 
the prosecutor's "lust for killing David Lucas." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman cited remarks made by anti-death proponents, including Mother Teresa, 
Pope John Paul II and Benjamin Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Lucas is not in the category of the irredeemable," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
He cited testimony by Lucas' family members who begged the jury last week to 
spare him. 
</P>
<P>
"Mercy, mercy, the noblest of human emotions . . . which distinguishes us from 
the animals," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas was convicted June 21 of the first-degree murders of University of San 
Diego student Anne Swanke, 22, on Nov. 20, 1984 and of Suzanne Jacobs, 31, and 
her son, Colin Jacobs, 3, on May 4, 1979. He was also found guilty of 
attempting to murder Jodie Santiago-Robertson, 34, of Seattle, in a June 8, 
1984, attack.

SAN YSIDRO PROJECT DISCOVERS CURE FOR ILLS OF GANGS, DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARICARMEN EROLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Villa Nueva was opened in an area plagued by gang- and drug-related 
crimes, it was known as a hotbed for illegal activities to the point that even 
the police patrolling the area were reluctant to enter the 390-unit, low-income 
housing project. 
</P>
<P>
But, after almost 20 years of existence, the San Ysidro development has 
eliminated gangs from its grounds, and, through a successful teen club, unusual 
community unity and increased security, its 1,800 tenants now live in relative 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
Although increased security and community cohesiveness have played important 
roles at the project run by an Augustinian order, the teen club established 13 
years ago in the Guadalupe Center has been singled out as the key in the fight 
against gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"People usually do things to cure the problem after it has happened," said 
Felipe Muro, director of the teen club. "The main reason we don't have (gangs) 
is that we have our own peer group. I guess it would be like a family, like one 
big family." 
</P>
<P>
Muro, who grew up in Villa Nueva before he was hired as director of the club 
five years ago, said the teen-age members of the club now are probably the 
first generation at the complex in which the majority is thinking about college 
and not jail. Through the 75-member club and other programs in the community, 
most of the older teen-agers are now either working or in college. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outlets for Energy 
</P>
<P>
He attributes the lack of gang interest not only to the support system created 
by the club but also to the outlet it provides for aggressive energy through 
different activities, such as football and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"We have our own group," said Rene Harris, 11. "We play a lot of sports, and we 
get to have fun, that is why we don't believe in gangs and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
In school, members of area gangs know who is from Villa Nueva and leave them 
alone, and, although there is some contact, the fellowship provided by the club 
takes away the allure a gang might have, said 16-year-old Jose Saldana. 
</P>
<P>
According to detective Felix Aguirre of the San Diego Police Department's 
street gang unit, Villa Nueva has "cleaned up quite a bit" and has become one 
of the better places to live in San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
He, too, praises what the club has accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids join gangs because they have nothing more to do," Aguirre said. "They go 
out to find companionship and fellowship and eventually join gangs." 
</P>
<P>
When Villa Nueva first opened its doors, the Augustinian priests who had taken 
over the task of managing the project did not have the time or manpower to 
screen all the tenants, and some "troublemakers" were admitted, said Father 
John Blethen, Villa Nueva's social director. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been in business for 20 years, and we ended up with some bad apples at 
first, but we've gotten rid of most of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 95% of the tenants in Villa Nueva receive federal rental assistance 
through a program for families with limited income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang Members the Exception 
</P>
<P>
Blethen and Muro acknowledge that some teen-agers are still members of gangs, 
but they say those cases are the exception. 
</P>
<P>
As important as the club has been in ridding the complex of gangs, they and 
others agree that the teen club could not have succeeded without community 
unity. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody pulls together when things need to be done," Muro said. 
</P>
<P>
That unity was created in part through a food cooperative, a religious 
education program, a preteen club, and an adult school. Also, since 1979, the 
project provides space in the La Paz Center for a YWCA outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a distribution center for the San Diego Food Bank, and every 
second Friday of the month the Villa Nueva bus carries enough staples from the 
food bank to distribute to 460 families, under the direction of Antonia 
Gallegos, a longtime Villa Nueva resident. 
</P>
<P>
"Tenant unity is one of the greatest assets (here)," said Armando Hurtado, 
resident manager of Villa Nueva. "You have a steady population, and they are 
very community-oriented people. What we do is for the benefit of the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
The Augustinians have tried to create a Christian sense of community among the 
tenants, said Blethen, even though only about 60 units actively participate in 
Villa Nueva events. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it is a case of the minority having a good, strong influence over 
the majority," he said. "I think that people who live here appreciate that they 
have a good environment and want to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents say that, years ago, whenever something bad happened in San 
Ysidro, people would blame Villa Nueva residents. Now the turnaround is so 
complete that there is a two-year waiting list to get an apartment, and the 
Augustinians are not taking any more applications until the list shortens. 
</P>
<P>
"Villa Nueva doesn't provide just housing, it provides life, a dream, a 
future," Blethen said. "It provides a lot of extra things."

FALSE AIDS NOTICE MAY NOT HAVE BROKEN LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Postal inspectors and the U. S. attorney's office are uncertain whether any 
laws were broken in the case of a San Diego businessman who in May received a 
bogus letter falsely notifying him that he had contracted AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Local doctors described the bogus letter as "weird" and "sick," but authorities 
Monday were uncertain whether any charges could be filed, should the 
perpetrator be caught. 
</P>
<P>
Federal mail-fraud statutes require that there "be a scheme to defraud 
(someone) of money or property," Assistant U. S. Atty. George Hardy said Monday 
in San Diego. "It may be that this wouldn't necessarily fall under mail fraud. 
But it sounds like some real sicko is involved." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are still uncertain who sent the letter, which included the 
45-year-old businessman's correct Social Security number. The letter indicated 
that blood testing by a Washington, D. C.-based laboratory had confirmed the 
existence of the HIV virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clean Bill of Health 
</P>
<P>
The professional-looking letter had added credibility because the man, who has 
asked for anonymity, recently had completed blood tests for a general physical 
conducted by a Kaiser Permanente physician. The businessman received a clean 
bill of health after that physical examination, Kaiser physician Dr. William L. 
Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
But the letter left the man "very upset," Sperling said. The Kaiser Health Plan 
member learned that the letter was a hoax when he telephoned his regular 
physician. The man was reassured about the letter's bogus nature during an 
in-office visit, Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
When Kaiser officials investigated, they found that the alleged laboratory did 
not exist and that the letter had been mailed in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Sperling, who alerted members of the San Diego Medical Society to the bogus 
letter, said that no similar letters since have surfaced. Sperling also 
contacted the California Medical Assn. and the American Medical Assn., learning 
that no other doctor has reported a similar case. 
</P>
<P>
The post office's investigation has been slowed because the only inspector 
familiar with the letter has gone on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently there was no violation of the law that (postal inspector Dennis 
Olson) knew of," said U. S. Postal Service spokesman Gregory Gamache, who had 
yet to see the letter Monday. "At any rate, it would probably be up to the U. 
S. attorney's office whether to prosecute or not." 
</P>
<P>
Local doctors contacted Monday said that generally accepted medical procedures 
are designed to keep patients from learning about a life-threatening disease 
such as AIDS through a letter from a third party such as a testing laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
"We would never have done anything even similar to that," Sperling said. "Our 
policy is that a patient would come in for an appointment with a physician," 
who would carefully describe test results and follow-up procedures. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego's policy is to "sit down every single patient" tested for AIDS and 
"talk to them thoroughly before testing is done," said Brunildo Herrero, a 
professor of medicine and director of the UC San Diego Ambulatory Care Section. 
"That way they know exactly what (testing results) mean." 
</P>
<P>
Counseling is extremely important in AIDS testing because patients can test 
positive in an initial screening, but test negative in more thorough tests that 
are subsequently administered, Herrero said. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone tests positive with the initial screening, we'd test it again," 
Herrero said. "If they test positive again, we'd use (a definitive) test that 
takes three or four days to complete." 
</P>
<P>
Even before testing for AIDS begins, however, UCSD doctors make sure that 
patients "sign a specific form that acknowledges they understand" the testing 
procedure, Herrero said.

POLICE EXPANSION SCALED BACK; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL POISED TO PASS $956.5-MILLION BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council on Monday set the stage to approve a $956.5-million 
fiscal 1990 budget, retreating slightly from its commitment to beef up police 
presence but rescuing several popular programs and services that were early 
casualties of the drive to improve public safety. 
</P>
<P>
A day before its final scheduled hearing on the budget, the council reinstated 
10 community-service officers who staff storefront police stations around the 
city, and restored two-thirds of the funds cut from the lifeguard service. 
</P>
<P>
To save the community-service officers, the council cut back the expansion of 
its police force by four, reducing the buildup to 116 new officers. Just last 
month, council members were seeking 140 new officers, but they backed away from 
that plan when Police Chief Bob Burgreen advised them that it would expand the 
department too rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
The council also put $117,000 back into the budget for a San Ysidro preschool 
program deleted June 22 in the mistaken belief that school district funds were 
available for it. Councilman Ed Struiksma also persuaded Sharp Cabrillo 
Hospital to pay for heart-resuscitation equipment to be carried by 
firefighters, a high priority for the council. 
</P>
<P>
But the council made no move to restore other major cuts that had freed up 
funds for police officers, including a $392,000 reduction in City Atty. John 
Witt's consumer-fraud unit and more than $193,000 from weed- and 
brush-abatement programs. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a spending blueprint nearly $26 million higher than the 
$930.9-million budget proposed by City Manager John Lockwood on May 11 and 
nearly $149 million more than the budget for fiscal 1989, which ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the increase over Lockwood's proposal comes from a $16.1-million 
increase in Water Utilities Department funding. A land sale generated $2.9 
million, early repayment of a loan by the Centre City Development Corp. 
produced $1.1 million, and projected profits from this fall's Soviet Arts 
festival yielded $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The budget is heavy in capital projects, including park renovations and 
improvements to the city's sewer system, along with two mobile police vans, an 
upgraded communications system and land for two substations -- all for the 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
One project not included in the city's plans -- a jail -- caused the only 
conflict at Monday's hearing. Council Members Judy McCarty and Bruce Henderson 
continued to press for the facility, arguing that added police officers are of 
little consequence when jail overcrowding forces them to cite and release more 
than 100 misdemeanor arrestees every day. 
</P>
<P>
The plan provides "more police officers chasing the same criminals and 
releasing them on the street. Bully, bully," McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Maureen O'Connor argued that the city's primary responsibility is 
safety in the streets, and noted that Struiksma and Councilwoman Gloria McColl 
are meeting with county supervisors on plans for a jointly funded jail. That 
proposal is scheduled to come before both boards at a joint meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of San Diego's main responsibility is the safety and security of 
neighborhoods," O'Connor said. Residents "want security. They want to feel safe 
in their neighborhoods. Police aren't just there to arrest people. They're 
there to do preventive law enforcement." 
</P>

The council also asked Lockwood to determine whether part of a $170,000 charge

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oceanside man suspected of abandoning, battering and molesting twin boys at 
a Del Mar motel was ordered Monday to stand trial on six felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
The former girlfriend of the defendant, Charles Thomas McCoy, 27, testified 
Monday against McCoy about the abuse of the boys, now 3, who are living in a 
foster home. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy DeSimone, 25, of Oceanside testified that McCoy took her twins the 
Thursday before Easter and that she did not see them again until she saw a 
picture of their badly beaten bodies in the following Monday's newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Having already pleaded guilty to one count of child endangerment, DeSimone 
testified during McCoy's preliminary hearing. She said she decided to testify 
against him "because he obviously did it," DeSimone told San Diego Municipal 
Judge Terry Knoepp. 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone is serving a one-year jail term given her July 5. 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone's testimony centered on a 1988 incident when one of her children 
suffered a broken leg and the time leading up to the children's disappearence 
and eventual discovery. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, Andrew DeSimone suffered a broken leg while staying with his 
mother and McCoy at a North County motel. One of the charges stems from that 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone testified that, when she was getting out of the shower she heard a 
"thud hit the floor." McCoy told her the boy had fallen. The two took him to 
the hospital, where a counselor approached DeSimone about the injury. 
</P>
<P>
The counselor then talked to McCoy, and the conversation ended in a "heated" 
exchange, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, a Juvenile Court ordered McCoy not to see the children. 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone testified that, on March 23, McCoy took the twins while she attended a 
counseling session. She said the three never returned and she searched North 
County for them for three days. 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone said McCoy returned home March 26, without the twins, telling her they 
were fine and in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, DeSimone said, her mother showed her a newspaper, which had a 
picture of the twins. She immediately called the hospital to find out their 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone said that at first she did not believe McCoy could have done such a 
thing, but that she changed her mind "when I heard what my sons had to say." 
</P>
<P>
McCoy's arraignment was set for July 31.

THE GREENING OF THE SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush and his world colleagues have taken a decisive step toward an 
imperative goal: rescuing Planet Earth from centuries of environmental neglect. 
At their Paris conference, the leaders of the seven major industrial 
democracies have recognized that nothing else they seek to do will matter if 
the global environment is degraded to the point it cannot sustain the economic 
and social fabric of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
Some environmental groups criticized the communique of the annual economic 
summit conference for lacking detail. But specifics are not as important as the 
nature of the strong commitment made by the leaders to a comprehensive 
environmental recovery program for the fragile spaceship that carries all of 
humankind on its journey through space and time. In fact, the communique was 
quite specific for a document of its sort. Nearly half of the 22 pages dealt 
with the environment, covering individual topics such as the greenhouse effect, 
ozone depletion, ocean dumping, deforestation and energy conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the leaders recognized that more must be done than merely 
cleaning up the mess after an industrial society has worked its will on Earth's 
resources. They pledged to work toward a common goal of "preserving a healthy 
and balanced global environment in order to meet shared economic and social 
objectives." The structure of the wording is important: "In order to meet 
shared economic and social objectives." Without a healthy planet, a civilized 
industrial society cannot flourish. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, the decision came just two decades after American astronauts 
transmitted back to Earth the first glorious photos of the home planet from the 
moon. It was an astounding thing to see, the vibrant cloud-draped sphere, 
shining a bright blue in the reflection from its vast oceans. And this past 
weekend, Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), the former astronaut, spoke eloquently and 
urgently about the fragility of the atmosphere as seen from space. The 
atmosphere is not the ample protective cloak it often seems to be to one 
standing on the ground looking up. The Earth, in fact, is separated from the 
hostile vacuum of space by a mere sliver of protective gases. 
</P>
<P>
Fulfilling the Paris pledges is a daunting challenge. As the wealthiest and 
most technically advanced nation, this country must set an example by how it 
deals with its own pollution. As one summit observer noted, the strong 
environmental platform from the Paris meeting has raised expectations. People 
are going to look for results in the year between now and the next session, 
which will be held in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is off to a commendable start on a number of 
environmental matters , such as his proposal for a vigorous new Clean Air Act. 
There are reports that the President will soon announce a massive tree-planting 
program. But there will be questions, too, about national policy that still 
subsidizes the cutting of the last old-growth forests and continues excessive 
dependence on fossil fuels, the source of much of the pollution that fouls the 
fragile atmospheric shield. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his six colleagues must be given full credit, however, for charting a 
bold new environmental course for the international community. This is not a 
battle that any single nation can win by itself. As is so apparent when one 
views those photos of Earth from space, this is one enterprise in which 
everyone, now and for all time, has a stake that can only be called vital.

HUD SCANDALS UNCOVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been attempting to persuade HUD to change its policy concerning the 
"County-wide Waiting List Rule." Local facilities are prohibited from marketing 
vacant units to qualified seniors in the immediate area and must offer them 
instead to seniors throughout the entire county. 
</P>
<P>
Many seniors in east and south Los Angeles have turned down units in Valencia 
because of its remote location, and despite newspaper ads, posters and flyers 
in public facilities they still remain unoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does this archaic practice affect the vacancy rate, require repeated 
notification, costly processing and administration, it also results in a 
precious loss of desperately needed space in subsidized units for the ones who 
need it most -- our low-income elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Repeated complaints to HUD have fallen on deaf ears because they are bound by a 
higher authority in Washington. It's time to change this antiquated practice 
and allow applicants the choice of first being placed in their local area.

BUSH REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am not impressed by President Bush's campaign reform proposals. If they are 
the measure of the man, he's a lightweight. 
</P>
<P>
He says that abolishing political action committees (PACs) will reduce the 
influence of money in politics (Part I, June 30). Does he believe it? I doubt 
it. He is totally cynical about PACs. Not long ago, he and other Republicans 
touted them for enhancing political participation. Now, they want to get rid of 
them because they give too much to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Bush would abolish PACs when it isn't necessary. Why not limit campaign 
spending and specify that within that limit candidates can raise not more than 
20% from PACs? It would reduce their influence while respecting their right to 
participate. More importantly, it would keep campaign spending from spiraling 
out of control, as it does when there are no limits. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has said that he agrees with the Republican Party. There should be no 
limits on spending. A candidate is justified in spending any amount in pursuit 
of public office. I am appalled that he has so little vision.

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I read the article "Child Deaths Put Faith on Trial" (Part I, June 27), I 
struggled to separate fact from fiction and fear from truth. I was particularly 
surprised and disappointed by your use of the deliberately defamatory and 
misleading statement of David Dunn, assistant district attorney in Sonoma 
County, who apparently believes that Christian Scientists are similar to Jim 
Jones' followers. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever one may think about spiritual healing, such opinions are meaningless 
in comparison to the Jonestown tragedy. What happened in Jonestown is very 
removed from the practice of Christian Science. It is obvious that Mr. Dunn has 
yet to discover that Christian Scientists have, for over 100 years, been 
successfully healing themselves, their children and others. 
</P>
<P>
This article is a good reminder that once again our civil liberties are in 
jeopardy, as having legislatively passed exemptions from health and welfare 
codes, etc., are no guarantee against prosecution. Those Christian Science 
parents whose children died must now bear a financial burden, in addition to 
the loss of their child, of defendingthemselves against what the law guaranteed 
to them as Christian Scientists in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
As a nation that prides itself on the spirit of free thinking and living, 
surely we must be open-minded enough to accept another legitimate and proven 
means of healing.

SPACE IS PART OF OUR SECURITY; 
</P>
<P>
SOME DEFENSE FUNCTIONS CAN ONLY BE CONDUCTED FROM ABOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD L. ROWNY, Edward L. Rowny is arms-control adviser to the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THe United States is destined to become the world's premier space-faring nation 
in much the same way -- and for many of the same reasons -- it came of age as a 
seafaring country during the last century. We are entering an era in which 
space will be looked on as a medium rather than a barrier to man's progress, 
just as the world's oceans provided mobility rather than obstacles to human 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Civil and military operations are in space to stay. Space capability will 
greatly influence the relationships among nations by the end of the century. 
The ability to operate beyond the bounds of the atmosphere is rapidly becoming 
a major determinant of national power. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, as leader of the Western democracies, should not hesitate to 
assume the mantle of being a "space power," just as it did not shrink from 
becoming a sea power. As a sea power, the United States continues to 
scrupulously uphold international law, established through custom and treaty, 
assuring freedom of the seas for all nations. Similarly, our support of space 
law such like the Outer Space Treaty recognizes the common interest of all 
mankind in the guaranteed right to explore and use space freely for peaceful 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Space has captured the American imagination through programs such as the space 
station and the evolving plans for planetary exploration. Indeed, space has 
become a practical part of most of our lives. Its use as a place for basing 
navigation, communication, weather and Earth observation satellites has saved 
many lives, is providing valuable environmental information and serves as a 
catalyst for world commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Within the U.S. defense force structure, the space component has been designed 
to ensure uninhibited access to space for all such peaceful uses. Unthinking 
critics have labeled those portions of U.S. defense policy related to space as 
the "militarization" of space. The Soviets in particular have unfairly 
characterized both civilian and military programs like our space shuttle as 
moving the arms race into space. 
</P>
<P>
We must not be misled by Soviet charges that we are contributing to a so-called 
arms race in space. Unlike our space activities, which are largely for 
non-military purposes, those of the Soviet Union are 90% military in nature. 
This situation reflects the Soviet Union's commitment to provide its armed 
forces with all the resources necessary to ensure maximum space-based military 
support for offensive and defensive combat systems on land and sea, in air and 
outer space. The Soviets launched five times as many military payloads into 
orbit between 1983 and 1987 as did the United States. 
</P>
<P>
For the United States, space-based platforms provide a range of capabilities 
that underpin deterrence. U.S. forces depend on such systems for early-warning, 
communications, surveillance, navigation and arms-control treaty monitoring to 
such an extent that space is more than just a medium of choice; space has 
gradually become the only medium in which some important defense functions can 
be conducted efficiently on a global basis. 
</P>
<P>
A clear, though controversial, example of the importance of space to U.S. 
national security has moved back into the headlines. Even as our dependence on 
satellites increases in the 1990s, the world's only operational anti-satellite 
(ASAT) system -- owned and operated by the Soviets -- will have the capability 
to destroy vital U.S. and allied satellite systems. The Defense Department 
recently told Congress that our lack of a comparable capability is one of the 
most serious U.S. military deficiencies. We are unable to deter a Soviet ASAT 
attack by the threat of retaliating in kind. 
</P>
<P>
This critical deficiency means that the United States is unable to protect our 
terrestrial forces, such as the U.S. Fleet, from Soviet radar and electronic 
targeting satellites -- so-called gunsights in space. In view of the 
fundamental importance of U.S. and allied access to the seas in wartime, active 
means of holding the Soviet military space threat at risk must be developed. 
Doubters should take note: The case for a U.S. anti-satellite capability 
encompasses more than just deterrence theory; it is essential for protecting 
the men and women of our armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
The human race is in the process of moving to space. As the United States 
adapts its national-security policy to this new reality, we must carefully 
define and integrate that part of our overall strategy that involves military 
space activity. The worth of assigning particular space missions to our 
military should be based on whether the operation contributes to national 
security, and not on the fact that the mission takes place in space. 
</P>
<P>
Space will affect all aspects of our lives in the next century. Just as on the 
high seas, space-related peaceful activities will only flourish if assured of 
the backing of an on-call military capability to protect our space assets. An 
American capability to operate beyond Earth's atmosphere without interference 
will help ensure peaceful use of space by all friendly nations.

L.A. POLICE AND LA MIGRA -- AN OVERBEARING PARTNERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO H. RODRIGUEZ, Antonio H. Rodriguez is an attorney and director of 
the Latino Community Justice Center. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The collaboration of the Los Angeles Police Department with the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service in the Latino communities should be halted immediately. 
Their joint operations are discriminatory measures that are damaging relations 
between Latinos and the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
For several months Latinos have protested Police Department harassment of day 
laborers at sites where immigrants and refugees gather to seek work. The Police 
Department maintains that it is enforcing anti-loitering laws and answering 
complaints from local residents and business persons that the presence of the 
day laborers blights their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The plight of immigrants and refugees in our country is largely an economic 
problem. It is not one of crime. The day laborers, for example, are mainly 
immigrants, most of whom did not qualify for the amnesty legalization program 
and who are trying to eke out survival without resorting to other methods. Our 
city government apparently recognized this dilemma and recently allocated funds 
to establish a pilot project to create and coordinate job pickup sites for day 
laborers. It was a wise and compassionate move. By assisting desperate workers 
trying to survive by working, the city discourages people from turning to crime 
as an alternative, defuses a divisive social problem and helps to promote 
harmony. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a clear contradiction, the Police Department has been participating 
in joint raids with the INS at labor pickup sites. 
</P>
<P>
On June 30, the department combined forces in a daylight "drug" raid of 
MacArthur and Lafayette parks, in the heart of the Salvadoran community. 
</P>
<P>
The collaboration of the Police Department with INS is sowing Latino community 
anger and distrust against the department and city government. It is creating 
the fear that city-sponsored labor pickup sites may be traps for INS raids. The 
raids are inconsistent with the 1986 City Council resolution providing that the 
city will not report undocumented persons to the INS unless they have committed 
multiple misdemeanors or a serious felony. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department actions also violate the longstanding department policy 
not to use city funds to enforce federal immigration laws. The policy, like the 
1986 resolution, was designed precisely to encourage undocumented immigrants 
and refugees to cooperate with law enforcement and other government agencies by 
reporting crimes and serving as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials justify police partici-pation in the raids at labor pickup 
siteson the grounds that they are providing backup for the INS. However, their 
presence has been pervasive and they have played an active role in the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
As far as the community is concerned, we are witnessing police officers 
conducting immigration raids alongside immigration agents and immigration 
agents participating in police raids. Unfortunately, this is the direct result 
of well-intentioned but ill-conceived efforts of some City Council members to 
address the crime problem in the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
INS raids differ in objective from police drug raids. INS raids in the Latino 
communities are general searches made without warrants to ferret out the 
undocumented. They are unconstitutional and discriminatory because they target 
people on the basis of skin color, language or community in which they live, 
work or enjoy recreation, regardless of immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
Police raids, on the other hand, should be based on previously gathered 
intelligence and target identified, suspected criminals. But when the INS and 
Police Department conduct joint raids, the operations necessarily become 
immigration raids. They may apprehend some criminals, but they target and 
capture in their net many innocent persons who are then taken prisoner by INS 
agents if they are undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the MacArthur and Lafayette parks raid, hundreds of persons at 
the park were questioned, not only the "known drug traffickers," during four 
hours of widespread general panic. Only 78 persons were arrested and more than 
half of them were not charged with crimes but were arrested for being 
undocumented. Others, including U.S. citizens, documented persons, children, 
young people playing soccer and the homeless who just happened to be at the 
park were checked by the INS and released. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos are just as concerned as anyone about increasing crime. They are 
involved in citywide grass-roots, anti-crime efforts. But the INS has been a 
threat to us and our families and the increasing collaboration of the 
department with the INS could cause many to withdraw from cooperating with the 
police in those efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Criminals come from all class and national origins. The use of the INS at 
police anti-crime operations against Latinos is discriminatory, singles out 
immigrants and makes them scapegoats for crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
If local law enforcement does not want to erase the progress made in the 
efforts to build the trust and support of immigrants for crime-control efforts, 
then the police should halt its participation with INS in raids and other 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Police agencies must deal with our community as with any other community. 
Target the criminals among us based on their crimes, not their immigration 
status.

PROMISE REPLACES THE SIEGE MENTALITY; 
</P>
<P>
BOTHA, IN MEETING WITH MANDELA, GAVE RIGHT THE COLD SHOULDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLEM de KLERK, Willem de Klerk is a professor of communications at Rand 
Afrikaans University. He also is the elder brother of South Africa's National 
Party leader Frederik W. de Klerk. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reaction to the meeting between South African President Pieter W. Botha and 
jailed black leader Nelson Mandela can be measured four ways -- suspicion, 
reservation, hope and exaggerated expectation. 
</P>
<P>
Some are suspicious of the meeting because they see it as Botha's revenge on 
the National Party and its leader, Frederik W. de Klerk, a way to complicate 
matters for them with white conservatives in the September national election. 
These critics believe that Botha is on an ego trip to regain prestige before 
his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The other suspicion is that the meeting is a political trick to win more 
support from the left for Botha's National Party to appease the outside world, 
to stop sanctions and to make a meeting possible between President Bush and De 
Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
There is also widespread suspicion that it is a trap for Mandela, designed to 
estrange him from his support and thus cause discord in the ranks of the 
African National Congress. Political agendas are always motivated by some 
self-interest. But I am convinced that all of the ulterior motives that I have 
summarized do not apply in this case. 
</P>
<P>
The matter is too serious, Mandela is too strong and his position is so 
internationalized that the meeting did not take place by happenstance. Botha 
planned it with a positive purpose in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The second reaction to the Mandela-Botha meeting is reservation. What was the 
precise content of the discussion? Was it purely formal courtesy? Has 
continuity been built into the discussion? Has progress really been made, and 
did Botha and Mandela interpret each other correctly? What mandate did they 
have? And what pressure can be expected from their respective power bases? 
</P>
<P>
At this stage there are no precise answers. By all indications, however, the 
answers will be positive. 
</P>
<P>
The third reaction, which is the dominant one, is that this meeting has created 
hope that a breakthrough can be achieved in the racial cul-de-sac in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The eventual possibilities are promising: Further discussions with Mandela; 
contact with the ANC to discuss his release; inclusion of Mandela in 
pre-negotiations directed toward a post-apartheid political system; the lift of 
the ban on the ANC and the release of other political detainees; a lift of the 
state of emergency, and finally, the assurance that discussions will include 
leaders of all interested black factions. 
</P>
<P>
The first step in the process has been taken, but exaggerated expectations are 
not appropriate. Expectations that Mandela will be released within weeks are 
euphoric and boil down to wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Dramatic movement will depend mainly on two things: The National Party's 
purposefulness and the rate at which it moves ahead and stays on its course; 
and the ANC's willingness to make compromises and participate in the process of 
transitional politics.

<P>
I am not surprised that the meeting took place. It was an essential component 
of the strategy to bring about negotiation. It was also a component of the new 
spirit of reconciliation in southern Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Progress has indeed been made. The meeting will have a moderating impact on the 
national elections. The government now can hardly cite the ANC as enemy No. 1. 
As a result of this meeting, rightist movements in politics have finally 
received the cold shoulder from the government. The election agenda can now 
revolve around important and essential issues instead of the siege mentality 
once promoted by Botha. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks and whites interested in the social and political health of South Africa 
would be very wise to help promote the peaceful process that has started.

PEACEFUL REVOLUTION IS AT HOME IN BAJA

Much is being made of the fact that Mexico's powerful ruling party has lost a 
major election for the first time. It could mean a monolithic political system 
is becoming more democratic, and anyone interested in the stability and 
progress of Mexico should hope that's the case. But just as interesting is 
where that defeat occurred -- our neighboring state of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
The historic upset occurred when the candidate of Mexico's ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI) was defeated for governor by Ernesto Ruffo Appel, the 
nominee of the rival National Action Party (PAN). This was the first time in 60 
years the PRI did not use fraud to hold on to power and accepted defeat in a 
major election. Apparently, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is determined 
to live up to his pledge that Mexican elections will henceforth be conducted 
honestly. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas could not have chosen a better place to put his new policy of openness 
and change to the test. While Baja California is not the biggest or most 
important state in Mexico, it is on the cutting edge of trends that the nation 
will face well into the 21st Century, one of several interesting distinctions 
it shares with its big, rich neighbor across the border. 
</P>
<P>
Like Californians, residents of Baja believe their state has a distorted image 
in the rest of their homeland, and that the unfair image is based as much on 
envy as misunderstanding of what their state is really like. We don't like it 
when people from other states stereotype California as nothing but Hollywood 
glitz and Marin County hot tubs. Baja Californians resent other Mexicans, 
especially Mexico City sophisticates, dismissing them as would-be gringos eager 
to ape the United States. It is the closeness of Baja to the United States, and 
the impact of U.S. citizens and culture there, that help set it apart from the 
rest of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Like us, Baja Californians point with pride to the diversity of their state's 
economy and they note that it is quite healthy in contrast to the rest of their 
country. Despite a recession in Mexico, traditional industries like tourism, 
agriculture and fishing remain viable in Baja. But the most important change 
has been the growth in Baja's manufacturing sector, as high-tech companies set 
up border plants, known as maquiladoras, to produce goods for the Mexican and 
U.S. markets. And, like their California counterparts, business leaders in Baja 
are looking to the nations of the Pacific Rim for future opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Like this state, Baja is a magnet for immigrants. As in California, Baja's 
rapid growth has brought as many problems as benefits. Tijuana shares smog with 
San Diego. Mexicali shares water-quality problems with the Imperial Valley. And 
not all of Baja's new immigrants are legal. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is aware of the presence of thousands of Mexican workers in 
California's fields and industries, of course. But recently Mexicans have begun 
debating an influx of U.S. citizens into Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Consulate in Tijuana says more than 40,000 U.S. citizens are 
registered as living in Baja, and consular officials admit that number is 
probably low. Many of these people enter Baja on tourist visas rather than as 
residents, so technically they are in that country illegally. Most are retirees 
who have found pleasant places to live on small pensions. But many are young 
workers attracted by a cost of living far cheaper than in Los Angeles or San 
Diego, according to a recent report in the New York Times. And recent changes 
in Mexican law, making it easier for foreigners to lease property in Mexico, 
could push even more U.S. citizens south of the border looking for relatively 
inexpensive land and housing. 
</P>
<P>
A few Mexicans are concerned about this. One minor political party, in fact, 
tried to make an issue of Baja's U.S. "illegals" in the recent election. But 
most Baja Californians appreciate the financial benefits that U.S. citizens 
bring to their state, just as many Californians know that they benefit from the 
labor of Mexican workers up here. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican nationalists will almost certainly try to make more of the issue in the 
future, especially in Mexico City, where the United States always seems more 
threatening. I expect Baja Californians will reply that chilangos, as they 
derisively call residents of the capital, don't understand the way things work 
along the border. 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, political analysts in Mexico assumed that the PRI would never 
allow a border state to fall to an opposition party precisely because of the 
fear with which the United States, and gringo influence in general, is seen in 
Mexico City. The fact that Salinas allowed it to happen indicates he has an 
open mind about the border region and its residents' relationship with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
That's good. For if the peaceful political revolution about to begin in Baja 
California gets all the attention it deserves, both nations could learn a few 
things -- like why most folks who live around here see U.S.-Mexico relations a 
lot differently than officials in faraway places like Mexico City and 
Washington, D.C.

COUPLE GIVE $1 MILLION FOR NICARAGUA PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A liberal Los Angeles real estate developer and his wife have given $1 million 
to Nicaragua to provide housing for disabled war veterans and to upgrade 
schools, recreation facilities and public places in the capital city of 
Managua. 
</P>
<P>
The donation by Aris and Carolyn Anagnos, of Brentwood, is "one of the largest, 
if not the largest, individual gift" given to Nicaragua, an embassy spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The initial 26 units of single-family housing for those severely injured in 
Nicaragua's civil war is being designed in part by the Topanga Canyon-based 
Architects and Planners in Support of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"We Americans are guilty of a major crime against the country of Nicaragua," 
Anagnos said last week, referring to U.S. support for the anti-Sandinista 
Contras. "We as individual citizens have to try to make up for it as best we 
can." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Attend Ceremony 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has continued to impose an economic embargo against 
Nicaragua but humanitarian aid is exempted. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless there's a legal prohibition, we don't have any kind of policy," a State 
Department official said. "If it's a legal thing, people have a right to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), a strong supporter of the Contras, 
expressed reservations about Anagnos' gift. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is going to be the guardian of these funds to provide for the homeless and 
the children?" Gallegly asked. "Or are they going to go into the Sandinista war 
chest for military purposes?" 
</P>
<P>
Anagnos, friends, family members and director Stephen Kerpen of Architects and 
Planners in Support of Nicaragua are in Managua for the project's 
ground-breaking ceremony today as well as the national observance of the 10th 
anniversary of the Sandinistas coming to power, which begins Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
About $400,000 will be spent to design and build concrete houses in the center 
of Managua and make them accessible to the handicapped, Kerpen said. Additional 
units are expected to be built in the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the funds are earmarked to equip and expand a school for war 
orphans, buy desks for schools, build sports courts and provide equipment at 10 
schools. An electrical system will be installed in a high school; neighborhood 
athletic facilities will be constructed across Managua; trees, shrubs and grass 
will be planted, and monuments will be built in public places around the 
capital, Kerpen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Priorities Among Priorities' 
</P>
<P>
Anagnos, 65, who visited Nicaragua in February, decided on the individual 
projects in consultation with Nicaraguan officials. 
</P>
<P>
He said unemployment, fueled by the United States' economic embargo against 
Nicaragua, has increased the need for recreational facilities for young men who 
cannot find work. Some schools are so ill-equipped that children must study 
standing up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anagnos contacted Architects and Planners in Support of Nicaragua, which has 
been sending Americans to rural areas in Nicaragua on construction projects 
since 1984, to provide technical assistance in the design of the housing for 
the disabled. The nonprofit group also will supervise construction. 
</P>
<P>
Anagnos said the $1 million is the proceeds from the sale earlier this year of 
a piece of land owned by him and his wife. They have previously given smaller 
amounts to nonprofit organizations active in Nicaragua, which Anagnos has 
visited four or five times since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Anagnos, who came to the United States from Greece to attend UCLA in 1946 and 
stayed, is president of Real Estate Dynamics. He has been a generous campaign 
contributor to liberal politicians, including Democratic presidential nominee 
Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
He is president of the board of the Humanitarian Law Project, an organization 
that seeks to uphold the Geneva Convention, which protects victims and 
prisoners of war. He is vice president of the Hellenic American Council of 
Southern California, a Greek-American information and lobbying organization. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he is vice president of the Southern California chapter of 
Americans for Democratic Action and former president of the Southern California 
American Civil Liberties Union.

REFLECTIONS: 'I THINK I WOULD HAVE DRAGGED MY FEET IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE 
CANCER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Carlos Barila, born in Argentina and trained in civil engineering at the 
University of Rome, first worked with computers at Pan American World Airways. 
He later started a computerized travel agency in Granada Hills. Barila wanted 
to start his own computer company but doubted his business expertise. Five 
years ago at UCLA Medical Center, he got the courage to take the risk. Barila, 
49, lives in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
In '84 I had an encounter with the Big C. I had pains in my stomach. They were 
not normal. They took several hundred CAT scan pictures, and a couple hours 
later they were shown to me on a wall display with a light behind it, and it 
looked like an ad for footballs. No one felt that it was cancer, because cancer 
tumors are not known to be that large. 
</P>
<P>
The biopsy was done at Dr. Roslyn's office at UCLA. He was almost maternal, the 
way he handled it. It was not happy news. I knew that he was going to tell me 
that I had it, so I was half listening to him and half reviewing what I had 
done in 44 years. I remember feeling the tears run down my cheeks. I said to 
myself: "This is not going to take me. I'm going to fight it. I'm too young to 
die." 
</P>
<P>
The operation was very long, it lasted more than 18 hours. My body was 
practically partitioned in two, like a walnut. Dr. Morton had devised maps on 
how to get in and what to touch and what not to touch, and he even mapped out 
where they were going to be landing the pieces as they extracted them. 
</P>
<P>
They removed, I believe, a total of 38 or 42 pounds, altogether. And they 
removed my right kidney, a piece of my right lung and 60% of my liver. 
</P>
<P>
The best way I put it to people is to think of a balloon being inflated, inside 
of a fish tank. That's what it felt like inside of my body. The inflated 
balloon is going to push the little fish against the glass and the water out of 
the tank. In my case it pushed my kidney all the way down like if you step on a 
grape. 
</P>
<P>
When I left the hospital, I had exactly half my weight from the day I went in. 
I went in weighing about 180 pounds, and I got out of the hospital at 92. 
</P>
<P>
I saw part of the videotape of the operation, and the thing looks awful. Every 
time they have a fund-raiser they still use the picture of that tumor. The 
method that Dr. Morton used to extract this tremendous watermelon from inside 
me is still taught in surgery classes. It makes me feel that at least my 
contribution may help others, I hope. 
</P>
<P>
I went through every possible experimental treatment that UCLA had to offer, 
plus the conventional and approved ones. I went through the chemotherapy, and 
that I don't recommend. I'd rather have a drink. Radiation. I was totally 
hairless. Every single piece of hair on my body fell. It was a real experience. 
</P>
<P>
After my recovery in late '84, I decided that if it was the last thing I do, I 
want to build a computer that my software goes in. I want to work on the whole 
package, not just doing the software. I didn't have that much confidence in my 
business knowledge. I think I would have dragged my feet if it hadn't been for 
the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
I used the negative, "What if it's not as good as the doctors tell me? What if 
I only have three more years? I want to at least know that I gave it a try." 
That gave me the energy and the guts to do it. 
</P>
<P>
I started small. We opened here in Van Nuys, and we were successful. Within a 
month we were already in the black. 
</P>
<P>
We assemble our own computers. We custom design the software. We set up 
systems. We give you a turnkey operation, including the training. We now have 
two stores, and I think that we will make it. 
</P>
<P>
At least once a month I spend a day at UCLA talking to other patients, some of 
them not as lucky as I was and some of them, they're not sure what's going to 
happen. I tell everyone that you're not dead until you're dead, and so you 
can't give up your faith and give up hope or give up fighting until there's no 
more fight. From one day to the next discoveries do take place. 
</P>
<P>
I was like reborn in 1984. And my parents are at UCLA now. I owe my life to 
them.

EIGHTH-INNING RALLY GIVES CUBS WIN, 6-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the Dodger bullpen may be one of the best in the league, it remains the 
worst place for a Dodger starter. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Leary, making his first relief appearance since being moved to the bullpen 
last week, in place of disgruntled starter Tim Belcher, illustrated Monday 
night what Belcher had been complaining about. 
</P>
<P>
Leary paved the way for the Chicago Cubs to break a 3-3 tie by loading the 
bases in the eighth inning and then walking in the go-ahead run before 39,914 
at Dodger Stadium. The Cubs took it from there, getting two more runs to walk 
away with a 6-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Leary started trouble by walking Lloyd McClendon to start the eighth, after 
replacing Dodger starter Ramon Martinez in the seventh and setting down the 
Cubs in order. Then he allowed a single up the middle by Mark Grace. After 
Damon Berryhill bunted the runners to second and third, Leary intentionally 
walked Mitch Webster to load the bases for Curtis Wilkerson, who entered the 
game hitting .129 against right-handed pitchers such as Leary. 
</P>
<P>
But Leary treated him as if his first name was Babe, and walked him on four 
consecutive pitches to score a run. Things quickly fell apart from there, as 
the Cubs scored two more runs in the inning with reliever Ray Searage pitching, 
on an RBI fly in a rare pinch hit performance by Andre Dawson and on an RBI 
single by Domingo Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers should have known they were in trouble from the start. The Cubs 
scored before the game was 15 minutes old, on a 400-foot, three-run homer to 
center fence by Mark Grace. The first-inning blast came off rookie Martinez, 
who certainly wouldn't have imagined that kind of flight on his on his flight 
here from triple-A Albuquerque Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers countered with runs in the first, third and sixth innings to tie 
it, although they blew twice as many chances. In the first, off Cubs starter 
Scott Sanderson, Eddie Murray followed Willie Randolph's single with an RBI 
double. In the third they teamed up again, with Randolph hitting a single to 
center, being balked to second, and scoring on Murray's single, giving Murray a 
team-leading 51 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
They finally tied it in the sixth, against reliever Steve Wilson, when Jeff 
Hamilton followed Jose Gonzalez's pinch single with a double to left. 
</P>
<P>
But at that point, they were frustrated than happy, as they had left runners in 
scoring position in four of the first six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Lost in the late-inning mess was the early inning mess of Martinez, making his 
first start since Sunday's recall. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez had been up here once before, but just for a minute. He was recalled 
from Albuquerque June 4 to help the Dodgers weary pitching staff following 
their 22-inning game in Houston a day earlier. He threw a six-hit shutout 
against the Atlanta Braves June 5, and was sent back down the next day. He will 
stay longer this time, if only for his pure entertainment value. 
</P>
<P>
In just six innings, Martinez managed to throw 90 pitches. You'd throw that 
many, too, if you walked five, struck out five, hit one batter in the helmet 
and allowed another one to drive the ball 400 feet. Allowing three runs on just 
three hits, he was never boring. 
</P>
<P>
The first batter he faced, Jerome Walton, stuck out his bat and dribbled a ball 
down the third base line that finally stopped just inside the bag for a single. 
After Ryne Sandberg flied to right, Martinez walked McClendon on four straight 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Next was Grace, who was batting .424 against the Dodgers this year, including 
.400 at Dodger Stadium. After one pitch, a strike, Grace had seen all he needed 
to see. He sent the next ball over the center field wall, just above a leaping 
Kirk Gibson, for his fourth homer. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez retired the next two batters on groundouts, but his idea of fun was 
just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
He started the second by allowing a single to center by third baseman 
Wilkerson, an occasional starter. After Shawon Dunston forced Wilkerson at 
second on a grounder, Sanderson bunted Dunston to second with two out. 
</P>
<P>
It was time for the scare of the night. With Walton batting, Martinez uncorked 
an 0-and-1 fastball that smacked him in the side of a batting helmet. Walton 
crumpled in front of the plate with his hands over his face, but a few minutes 
later was trotting down to first base, perhaps thankful this wasn't the good 
old days when helmets were for sissies. 
</P>
<P>
With runners on first and second, Sandberg ended the threat with a grounder to 
third that started Martinez on a roll. He retired 11 of his next 15 batters 
before leaving for a pinch-hitter in the sixth. The four who reached base were 
walked there. 
</P>
<P>
That stretch included five strikeouts, including three in the fourth after a 
leadoff walk to Webster. He struck out Wilkerson swinging, Dunston swinging and 
Sanderson looking. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Orel Hershiser remained home Monday with the stomach flu, but told a 
club spokesman that he still planned to make his scheduled start against 
Chicago today. "We'll have to see how weak he is," pitching coach Ron 
Perranoski said of Hershiser. . . . Sore-shouldered pitcher John Tudor 
continues to work out with the team, but is still as many as two weeks away 
from picking up a baseball.

MORNING BRIEFING: TRUTH IS, YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Were the Dean brothers as zany as their nicknames, Dizzy and Daffy? Some say 
they weren't, but Grantland Rice told of a time Daffy was swigging on a soda 
pop as a train carrying the St. Louis Cardinals entered a long tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said he overheard this exchange between the brothers: 
</P>
<P>
Daffy: "Diz, you tried any of this stuff?" 
</P>
<P>
Dizzy: "Just fixin' to. Why?" 
</P>
<P>
Daffy: "Don't! I did, and I've gone plumb blind." 
</P>
<P>
Fair or foul?: Wrote Mike Littwin of the Baltimore Sun after Baltimore's Mike 
Devereaux hit the disputed homer that beat the Angels Saturday night: "Home 
Team Sports showed the replay at least nine times. Slo-mo. Reverse angle. 
Center-field camera. Underlined. Circled. Minicam. Late-night thrill cam. It 
still looked foul." 
</P>
<P>
Say what?: From Pete Rose, making like Norm Crosby: "All I want is for the case 
to be heard in front of a impractical decision-maker." 
</P>
<P>
Shame, shame: From Tom Powers of the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch: "How dumb 
are the radio guys? When a Los Angeles radio station got word over the wires 
that Bo Jackson of the Royals had to leave a game early with a strained thigh 
muscle, its representative called the K.C. press box to ask if Jackson would be 
able to return to the game later. Obviously a football-oriented station."

Trivia time: What do Pedro Guerrero, Rick Dempsey and Ray Knight have in 
common? (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Power outage: Deion Sanders is hitting only .239 at triple-A Columbus and has 
been fined more than once by Manager Bucky Dent for being late and not running 
out ground balls. 
</P>
<P>
Said Marty Noble of Newsday: "We've all seen storefronts with flawed neon signs 
-- you know, with a letter or two missing. Could it be that Neon Deion is 
suffering from that problem?" 
</P>
<P>
For all seasons: Headline in the Cleveland Plain Dealer after the Cavaliers 
drafted Seton Hall guard John Morton: "Cavaliers Think Morton Worth His Salt." 
</P>
<P>
Tunnel vision: The subject was concentration and Orel Hershiser told John 
McGrath of the Denver Post: "Last year during the seventh game of the National 
League playoffs, when I came out to pitch the top of the ninth, I got all 
caught up in the scene instead of the batter. I mean, there was a standing 
ovation for me and everything. So what'd I do? I threw the first pitch and hit 
the batter, Lee Mazzilli. That taught me a lesson. Always keep your game face 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Are you ready?: The latest from Chris Berman, ESPN's dispenser of nicknames: 
Greg (Life Is A) Cadaret. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: All three were World Series most valuable players. Guerrero 
shared the honor with Dodger teammates Ron Cey and Steve Yeager.

SMALL BANKS SNAG RIDE ON RISING STAR; 
</P>
<P>
SYSTEM FILLS NEED, GROWS BY OFFERING AN ATM NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Debby Kyle's worries began early in the 1980s, when financial giant Bank of 
America began an aggressive campaign to set up automated teller machines across 
the state, creating an electronic banking system that today boasts more than 
1,500 ATMs. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle was then ATM director for La Jolla Bank &amp; Trust, a mid-size bank with 
fewer than 10 ATMs. As Bank of America wooed more and more customers with the 
wonders and conveniences of its expansive electronic banking network, Kyle 
feared that her bank would get muscled out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Like other small-bank managers, Kyle sought a strategy that would enable La 
Jolla Bank to compete with the banking giants in the Age of ATMs. That's when 
Kyle realized she had to catch a rising STAR. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Bank &amp; Trust signed up with STAR System, the San Diego-based 
electronic banking system that has become the West's premier ATM network in 
less than five years. Since its incorporation in 1984, STAR has been able to 
wrest electronic banking, once monopolized by industry giants, and offer it to 
small and mid-sized banks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expanded Network 
</P>
<P>
Today, La Jolla Bank has 15 ATMs -- hardly enough to compete with Bank of 
America, Kyle concedes. But, with its STAR affiliation, La Jolla Bank customers 
can get cash at thousands of ATM sites in six Western states and Illinois, said 
Kyle, who is now vice president/director of training at La Jolla Bank. 
</P>
<P>
STAR has become the second-largest regional ATM network in the country by 
providing an accurate, reliable data-processing system to conduct electronic 
banking transactions. The STAR network now operates in California, Arizona, 
Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
STAR, a not-for-profit network founded by 11 banks and savings and loans in 
1984, had recruited 143 banks and S&amp;Ls by the end of its first year of 
operation in 1985. Now, STAR has 416 members. 
</P>
<P>
The number of ATMs in its system totals more than 7,600, more than triple the 
2,431 ATMs in the system four years ago. ATM cardholders in the STAR system now 
approach 19 million, up from 6.7 million in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of STAR has astonished many, but bankers and industry analysts 
say there's no secret behind the network's success: STAR has gained market 
dominance by recognizing and seizing a niche in the marketplace, offering 
quality service and paying attention to client needs. 
</P>
<P>
"STAR has one of the highest up-times in the country," said David Robertson, 
vice president of the Nilson Report, a leading newsletter for the credit card 
and ATM industries, based in Santa Monica. Up-time refers to the time an ATM 
system is operating and not broken down. "There's nothing that upsets a 
customer more than, when he walks up to a machine and it's shut down," 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a very competitive market," Robertson said. "All the banks are 
staying open later, opening on weekends. They're looking for a competitive 
edge. And that's exactly what STAR offers." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why First Interstate Bank of Nevada announced last month that it is 
joining STAR. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Expanded Access to Cash' 
</P>
<P>
"The idea behind it was to give our customers expanded access to their cash," 
said Graham McKenney, a First Interstate spokesman. "STAR has had phenomenal 
growth, and we'd like to take advantage of that." The Las Vegas-based bank is 
expected to add 132 ATMs and 250,000 cardholders to the network. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers disagree on whether electronic banking is profitable. Purchasing and 
installing one ATM costs nearly $40,000, and maintenance and operating costs 
can range from $2,000 to $5,000 per month per machine. Still, banks and savings 
and loans say it is an essential service for customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you lose money on the machines isn't a factor," said Lynne Duke, 
manager of bank card services at La Mesa-based Grossmont Bank, another STAR 
affiliate. "It's something you have to offer to be competitive," she said, 
describing ATM service as a cost of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rita Champ, STAR vice president of marketing and communications, 
for each transaction conducted at a STAR ATM, the network charges the ATM 
card-issuing bank a set fee of 50 cents per withdrawal and 30 cents per balance 
inquiry. STAR also charges client banks an initial membership fee of $1,500 to 
$2,500 and annual dues of $1,000 to $2,250. 
</P>
<P>
Those charges, however, are not necessarily passed along directly to 
cardholders. Some banks and S&amp;Ls charge ATM transaction fees, and others 
have chosen not to. 
</P>
<P>
All fees paid by STAR clients go back into updating the system or for marketing 
and research, Champ said. Because STAR is not-for-profit, revenue surpluses 
result in the lowering of transaction fees, Champ added. Within the last 18 
months, STAR has reduced its transaction fees three times. 
</P>
<P>
Although STAR achieved its success in part by offering competitive prices, the 
network's rapid growth is primarily because it was the first network to 
seriously offer electronic banking to small financial institutions. While 
national networks, such as Cirrus and Plus, sought only to recruit big-name 
banks, STAR rushed to fulfill the smaller bank's desire to grow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Luring Customers 
</P>
<P>
The major financial institutions were the first to realize that ATMs could lure 
more customers by offering 24-hour banking and the ability to get cash at many 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
With their considerable financial muscle, major institutions such as Bank of 
America and Security Pacific National Bank launched ATM expansion campaigns in 
the early 1980s, installing electronic tellers throughout the state. In the 
midst of the banks' ATM buildup, national networks were also gaining prominence 
and seeking a foothold in the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the national networks, eager to gain credibility and net as many 
customers as quickly as possible, offered electronic banking only to the 
biggest-name bank in a particular market, Champ said. For example, when Bank of 
America agreed to join Plus, the national network in return promised not to 
recruit a competitor in the same market. At the time, such exclusive agreements 
appeared to have given the banking powers a monopoly on electronic banking and 
threatened the smaller banks' future. 
</P>
<P>
"The big banks and the networks thought they were going to lock up the market," 
said Bill Haynor, first vice president of marketing at Great American First 
Savings, which was an original member of STAR. "But what they didn't realize 
was that they created an opportunity for the small banks to get together and 
say, 'Hey, they 
</P>
<P>
locked us out. Why don't we form our own network?' " 
</P>
<P>
Four banks -- California First Bank (now Union Bank), Lloyds Bank (now Sanwa 
Bank), Bank of the West and American National Bank -- did exactly that by 
conceiving the STAR concept in 1984. Then, the group recruited seven other 
well-recognized banks and savings institutions to join the original network. 
</P>
<P>
The fledgling network quickly bolstered itself as small and mid-sized banks 
that were shunned by the national networks flocked to join STAR. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offered a Service 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky because we were offering a service that was needed in the 
marketplace . . . a service that no one else was really offering," Champ said. 
"Smaller banks were eagerly looking for a vehicle to expand their system 
without having to spend money on brick and mortar for new branches. We were 
that vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Without having to ward off competitors' challenges, STAR was able to focus on 
providing quality service in its early years. Backed by its founding members' 
reputations and by paying attention to its members' needs, STAR had little 
difficulty recruiting clients. Today, the network has more than 67% of the 
state's ATM base. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough being the small guy," said Kyle of La Jolla Bank &amp; Trust. "The 
big banks always see their names in the headlines. We always get overlooked. 
But STAR has never made us feel like a small bank. They ask us for our opinions 
and pay as much attention to our needs as they do to the needs of their 
founding members." 
</P>
<P>
The STAR System also offered small bank managers a deal they couldn't refuse. 
By joining the network, small banks could expand their operations, yet 
simultaneously reduce their need for more branch offices. 
</P>
<P>
"Before ATMs, the only way you could expand was with brick and mortar," said 
Bob Plunkett, first vice president of the ATM department at San Diego Trust 
&amp; Savings. "But land in Southern California is so expensive. By joining 
STAR we've been able to reduce the number of proposed branches because we can 
augment our current branches with off-site ATMS." 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, San Diego Trust &amp; Savings was building five new branches 
annually, according to Plunkett. Today, the bank constructs one or two new 
outlets each year. "The slowdown is directly linked to our ATM growth," 
Plunkett said. "It's a lot cheaper this way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Name Recognition 
</P>
<P>
As STAR continued to lure members, the national networks recognized the flaws 
in its strategy to seek only the big-name banks, industry members say. But, by 
the time the national networks dropped their exclusive offers and opened 
electronic banking service to other institutions, STAR had gained dominance of 
the Western market. According to a consumer awareness study, STAR is the 
most-recognized electronic banking network in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Even the big banks are beginning to recognize the advantages of joining STAR. 
According to Robertson, vice president of the Nilson Report, STAR ensured its 
future over the last two years by recruiting Wells Fargo Bank and Bank of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting those two was a major coup," Robertson said. "The fact that STAR was 
able to crack that group, to persuade the big banks to join, shows just how 
strong it has become." 
</P>
<P>
Loraine Boland, vice president and manager of Wells Fargo's ATM department, 
denied that her institution joined STAR because it felt threatened by the 
network's growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we had such a large ATM network of our own, we didn't feel a need to 
join early on," Boland said. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo is the 
third-largest financial institution in the state according to assets and has 
more than 1,200 ATMs. Although Wells Fargo has 455 branches in the state, it 
only has 18 offices in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"We joined recently because we knew STAR had a lot of ATMs in Southern 
California," Boland said. "Most of our ATMs are in Northern California. We just 
wanted to give our customers in the southern part of the state the convenience 
of more ATMs." 
</P>
<P>
Besides offering their customers greater convenience by joining STAR, major 
banks that operate large numbers of ATMs can generate revenue by offering its 
machines to the network, said Champ of STAR. For example, any time a cardholder 
of Bank A uses an ATM at Bank B, the network pays Bank B a fee of $.40 per 
withdrawal and $.20 per balance inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"By opening our many ATM machines to other STAR members, we can generate 
revenue," said Brenda Yost, vice president of Bank of America's electronic 
banking department. The San Francisco-based bank is the state's largest 
financial institution according to assets and operates more than 1,500 ATMs. 
</P>
<P>
Although STAR brings money into the institutions, bankers say more money goes 
out to pay the network's transaction fees. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in order to offset the network's transaction fees and pay for the 
cost of ATM operations, some banks charge its customers a fee each time they 
use their ATM card at Bank B. Not all banks assess such fees, but those that do 
typically charge 50 cents to $1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Doesn't Make Any Sense' 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are trying to persuade more people to use their ATM cards," said Kyle 
of La Jolla Bank, which does not charge its customers fees when they conduct 
transactions at other STAR machines. "We pour money into ATM advertising 
campaigns. Then, we do a complete about face and charge them when they use 
their ATMs. That doesn't make any sense." 
</P>
<P>
Kyle says she understands banks' desire to offset operational costs, but 
criticizes them for not understanding the savings that electronic banking 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, if you just look at transaction fees we're losing money," Kyle said. 
"But consider how much more it would cost us to handle all the ATM transactions 
annually. The cost of more staffing, the cost of statement processing. And, if 
you took away our ATMs, consider the impact it would have on our customer 
service. If you want to talk about losing money, let's start with how many 
accounts we would lose if we lost our ATMs." 
</P>
<P>
STAR would prefer to see banks drop such charges to foster greater ATM usage, 
but the network has no control over that decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Those charges are not imposed by STAR," Champ said. "They're set by the 
individual banks. We can't try to regulate what they do. That's against 
antitrust laws." 
</P>
<P>
Although STAR officials were concerned that bank charges might deter customers 
from using ATMs, they said steady growth has assuaged such fears. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how many people are not using ATMs because of the charges," 
Champ said. "If there were no charges, maybe our volume would be higher. But we 
don't think it would be that much more. We're happy with our growth." 
</P>
<P>
Although STAR will welcome banks that want to join the network, Champ said 
seeking new members is not first on STAR's agenda. Nor does STAR plan to become 
a national network. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been so successful because we can focus on a local market," Champ said. 
"We know who our customers are, what they need. We could never do that if we 
had to pay attention to 50 different markets across the country." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, STAR wants to make bank customers aware of electronic banking's 
benefits and increase ATM usage. STAR, like other ATM networks, is exploring 
how to get more out of its system: using ATM cards to buy groceries, movie 
tickets, gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"When the ATM was first introduced, we marketed the card to be used for one 
purpose only: to get emergency cash quick," Champ said. "Card transactions have 
increased tremendously because now we're taking the approach that the customer 
can use the card anytime. The best way we can grow is if we can convince the 
cardholder to use the card more often, for various purposes."

FIRM SEES FUTURE IN DEVICE TO HELP COMPUTERS CONFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in 1977, Frank Peters was running a computer company when a Japanese firm 
approached him for advice about how to begin selling in this country an optical 
character reader, a device that reads printed information and turns it into 
data that can be stored electronically. "I said, 'Don't do it. It's a bad 
idea,' " Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
The company ignored Peters' advice, and ultimately he started selling the 
device for them. In selling it to banks, Peters saw a need for a way to make it 
"talk" to the banks' computers. Peters' company found the answer with a device 
it developed called a message switch. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years later, Peters' present company, Franklin Telecommunications in 
Westlake Village, has designed a product that is a distant stepchild to that 
message switch, and Peters believes that it puts his company more than two 
years ahead of rivals in helping computers talk to each other via phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
So confident is Peters about the computer product that he's effectively bet his 
company on it, selling two of Franklin's important divisions to concentrate on 
selling a device called a multi-protocol switching PAD, or MPP. 
</P>
<P>
Computers built by different manufacturers generally 'speak' different 
languages. But most companies that use computers don't want to throw out all 
their old equipment each time they buy a new computer. Instead they want to 
find ways of making all their computers talk to each other over special 
telephone lines. The MPP takes messages from one computer, puts them in a 
different language and sends them via phone lines to other computers. 
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, other major data communications companies such as Hughes 
and Telenet have sold fancier MPP-like gadgets that can be used in extensive 
computer networks. But many of those devicescannot be reprogrammed easily and 
most are expensive. Larry Cynar, a data communications analyst with Dataquest, 
a San Jose market research firm, said that while a Telenet system can cost 
$100,000 or so, Franklin can offer a comparable but simpler system for as 
little as $20,000 to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin's MPPs also come with the feature Peters said sets them apart: 
software that allows a technician to reprogram the devices if old computers are 
replaced or new ones are added to a network. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a good strategy," Cynar said. "Franklin's been doing it for several 
years now and has a good spot." 
</P>
<P>
Already, Franklin's MPP sales have grown from zero 2 1/2 years ago to more than 
$5 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30, according to John Hochstein, 
Franklin vice president and secretary. And Hochstein predicts that sales will 
double or triple next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MPP Customers 
</P>
<P>
Franklin counts among its MPP customers Citicorp, which is using the device to 
help connect the bank's branch computers, automatic tellers and central main 
frame computers, a deal Franklin says will be worth more than $1 million in the 
first year. Franklin also announced a deal to provide MPPs for First Boston 
Corp.'s computerized securities trading system, as well as one with San 
Diego-based Price Co., a national wholesaler of appliances and office goods. 
</P>
<P>
But as is the case with most new electronics products, Franklin has to keep an 
eye on a competitor. Amnet, a privately held Massachusetts firm, offers a 
similar MPP device, according to Robert Machlin, the company's vice president 
of marketing. Machlin declined to give a sales figure for Amnet's line of 
competing MPPs but said the company's total sales for all product lines were 
about $5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Another worry for Franklin, according to Dataquest's Cynar, is that some major 
data communications companies want to try and introduce their own lower cost 
MPP versions. "Everybody wants to go that way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extra Cash 
</P>
<P>
To try to keep its technological edge, Franklin may seek an extra infusion of 
cash to fund the expected growth in its sales of MPPs, Peters said. The money 
would go for research and development and sales and staff support, he said, 
since he expects his MPP division to double in size to 120 workers in 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin has already raised $1.5 million as part of an agreement in November, 
1988, with a Canadian data communications company, Gandalf Technologies. 
Gandalf purchased a 7% stake in Franklin and agreed to market its products in 
Canada. "We have faith in Franklin," said Gandalf's vice president of corporate 
marketing, Thomas Baumgartner. "We knew that to be fully successful that they 
needed some more money to put in some more engineering and some more support." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, to narrow its focus on its MPP business, Franklin announced 
earlier this month a $550,000 deal to sell the assets of two of its divisions: 
Shamrock, a direct marketing operation, and PC Products, which makes and 
markets computer peripherals such as modems and data storage systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Elements 
</P>
<P>
But Franklin's plans to shed the two divisions could be risky, since those 
parts of the company have proved key to its expansion. According to Franklin's 
annual report for the year that ended June 30, 1988, the PC Products division 
brought in the largest portion of Franklin's $26.1 million in sales. Since 
Peters started the company in 1983, Franklin has grown steadily, and in the 
nine months that ended March 31, Franklin's sales climbed to $23.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growth, Franklin has not always been profitable. In the 1987 fiscal 
year, Franklin lost $1.2 million on sales of $19.4 million, and in its latest 
fiscal year, Franklin earned only $339,000. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, who owns 35% of Franklin's stock worth about $2.6 million at recent 
prices, has essentially opted for the Kentucky Fried Chicken school of 
management: Try and do just one thing right. 
</P>
<P>
"By selling off those divisions I think I got rid of 95% of my risk," Franklin 
said. "I'll admit that I was stretched trying to manage all three kinds of 
business."

FORMER TOP IDC EXECUTIVE LEADS BUYOUT OF AME INC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the businesses Lawrence J. Berkowitz ran as an executive with IDC 
Services, a casting and payroll services company for the entertainment and 
advertising industry, was Central Casting. 
</P>
<P>
The venerable Hollywood institution is the company directors have called on 
since the early days of movie making when they needed extras. Now, Berkowitz 
has cast himself in a challenging role: head of Hollywood's biggest videotape 
post-production house, AME Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the New York investor led a group that will buy the Burbank company. 
They agreed to pay $57 million for AME's 4.9 million shares of stock and assume 
about $42 million in AME's outstanding debt. 
</P>
<P>
For Berkowitz, 48, the sale marks a return to the entertainment business after 
more than a year as a New York-based private investor and consultant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Television Executive 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz, a lawyer, worked as director of business affairs for Columbia 
Pictures' television operation from 1974 to 1977, when he joined IDC. He ran 
IDC's entertainment-related businesses and later was IDC's chief executive 
until the company was sold to a group of former Viacom executives in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In AME, Berkowitz and his group are buying a young company that has already 
made a name for itself. AME was founded nine years ago by Andrew M. McIntyre 
and has become a giant in post-production work for movies and television. 
</P>
<P>
AME mainly transfers film to videotape so movies and television shows can be 
mass-distributed. In addition to its Southern California operations, AME has 
facilities in New York and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is an expensive one, and the Berkowitz group is taking on considerable 
debt. On top of the $100 million needed to buy the stock and refinance the debt 
is another $10 million for transaction fees. Nearly all of the money comes from 
two sources, First National Bank of Boston's entertainment lending group and 
Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AME Generates Cash 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz said AME generates a lot of cash that can be used to help reduce the 
debt. In addition, he said, he believes the company can cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
AME's facilities can be consolidated, he said. In Southern California alone, he 
said, AME has facilities in eight or nine locations. Berkowitz added that the 
company has about 150,000 square feet in excess space in the Los Angeles area 
that it can sell to raise money to pay off the loans. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very comfortable with the debt," Berkowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz said he sees a big opportunity for AME to move heavily into 
post-production work for the advertising industry, where he developed contacts 
while working for IDC. 
</P>
<P>
AME mainly works for Hollywood now. Its dependence on the entertainment 
business showed when its earnings suffered last year in the wake of the 154-day 
strike by film and television writers. In the year that ended last Sept. 30, 
AME's profit fell 22% to $3.2 million on revenue of $47.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz is bringing in experienced AME management. Two members of his team 
are Larry Kingen, who resigned as president and chief operating officer this 
year, and Martin Katz, who was chief financial officer briefly this year. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz, who will become chairman and chief executive of AME, said he plans 
to regularly consult with McIntyre. "He knows everything about this company," 
Berkowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approval Needed 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre, AME's chief executive, could not be reached for comment on his plans. 
As AME's largest shareholder by far, with nearly half of the stock, McIntyre 
needed to approve the sale. "You couldn't do this without his cooperation," 
Berkowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre initially wanted to buy AME himself and tried to do so for four months 
late last year and early this year. In February, McIntyre dropped a $37-million 
bid to buy the 56% he did not already own because he was unable to find 
financing on terms he wanted. Berkowitz, who was a consultant to AME last year, 
then emerged as a suitor. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre's stake is worth a hefty sum. He will be paid about $22 million, or 
$10 a share, for his 44% stake under an option that McIntyre sold to the 
Berkowitz group in April. In 1987, he sold 500,000 shares for $6.3 million as 
part of an initial public offering of AME stock. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining shares, including about 25% owned by an employee stock plan, are 
to be bought by the Berkowitz group for $12.50 a share, or nearly $35 million.

AVERAGE RESALE PRICE FOR HOUSES REACHES $308,100 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The average resale price of a single-family house in the San Fernando Valley in 
June climbed 7% from the previous month to a record high $308,100, the San 
Fernando Valley Board of Realtors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The latest average -- which marked the first time it surpassed $300,000 -- 
eclipsed the $287,400 average price in May. It was up 24% from the $248,800 
price recorded in June, 1988, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
The higher prices in June came despite a 10% drop in sales of single-family 
houses last month, to 1,209 units from 1,338 in May. Sales also fell 21% from a 
year earlier, when 1,525 units were sold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condominium Resales 
</P>
<P>
Condominium resales, meanwhile, totaled 369 in the Valley in June, down 23% 
from the 481 sold in May and down 7% from the 395 sold in June, 1988, the board 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The average resale price of condominiums last month fell 7% to $143,400 from a 
record high $153,400 in May but was up 12% from the $128,100 average a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The board suggested that average prices overall remained strong amid lower 
sales last month because a greater percentage of the sales that did occur 
involved relatively expensive properties. Sales of single-family houses and 
condominiums priced between $200,000 and $400,000 accounted for 41% of all 
sales last month; a year earlier, they accounted for 30% of all sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rise in Interest Rate 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, the lower overall sales last month also reflected the rise in 
mortgage interest rates that occurred in the spring, which helped reduce 
housing demand throughout much of the nation. Mortgage rates have since fallen 
sharply again -- with fixed rates on conventional 30-year-loans dropping below 
10% in some cases -- but housing analysts don't expect to see the impact of the 
lower rates on sales until this month's results are known. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the continued lofty prices for Valley housing spurred a record 
number of homeowners to put their properties on the market last month, the 
board said. But the rush of new listings is giving house buyers more to choose 
from and therefore could slow the escalation of prices, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Now Are Competing' 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the volume of listings on the market, sellers who priced their 
property hoping to get top dollar may have to reconsider and realize they now 
are competing for buyers," board President Buddy Bernard said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
A record 3,750 owners listed their houses on the Multiple Listing Service in 
June, up 10% from 3,401 in May and up 36% from 2,750 a year ago. Overall, there 
were 9,673 active listings available last month, the board said.

WHEN AN EXOTIC IMPORT NEEDS A PART, WHO YOU GONNA CALL? TRY A SPECIALIST, 3 
FIRMS SAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When people describe Southern California as the car capital of the world, they 
mean not only the sheer number of cars, but also the variety. Ubiquitous 
Chevrolets and Hondas share the roadway with less common Triumphs from Britain, 
Porsches from West Germany and Alfa Romeos from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Yet common or rare, they all eventually need new parts -- the average new car 
has 15,000 of them. If you drive a Chevy, buying parts is often as simple as 
going to a nearby Chief or Pep Boys store, or perhaps the nearest Chevrolet 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
But what if you drive an MG -- which is no longer manufactured -- and need a 
water pump? Or a 1960 Porsche 356 blows out its clutch? Or a 20-year-old Alfa 
Romeo Spider needs a U-joint? You could try a big chain like Chief, but there's 
no guarantee it carries the part. A Porsche or Alfa dealership might have it, 
but you'll pay top dollar and you might have to wait for the dealer to order 
it. 
</P>
<P>
So owners of such cars often go see Marty Osborne, Mel Kay or John Shankle. All 
run firms in the San Fernando Valley that specialize in selling parts for 
exotic European imports, and at prices that often undercut the dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The three firms do much of their business by mail order, and in that market 
alone they must vie against dozens of other independent parts suppliers 
nationwide. Each of the three advertises in Road &amp; Track, Car and Driver 
and other car-buff magazines, and each has a toll-free telephone number to take 
orders. Kay and Shankle send parts catalogues to thousands of potential 
customers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
But for Osborne, Kay and Shankle, that's where the similarity ends. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Osborne's Import Motor Parts in Sherman Oaks, which sells parts for 
British cars only, is no Pep Boys. His one-room store looks a bit tattered and 
grimy, and his two telephones are covered with his greasy fingerprints. 
Pictures of old British roadsters hang on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
There's no computer here to track Osborne's inventory of hundreds of parts. But 
Osborne doesn't need one. The inventory is stored in Osborne's head. And if he 
doesn't have the exact part, Osborne knows how to get it either from another 
supplier or by improvising. 
</P>
<P>
"No book said that an MGB U-joint is the same as a Lotus, and it is," said the 
broad, 6-foot-4 Osborne, whose runs his shop in T-shirt, jeans and tennis 
shoes. "No one knows that, but I do." 
</P>
<P>
Osborne, 38, buys his parts from a handful of major suppliers from Britain, but 
he also buys wrecks of British cars for salable parts. For instance, Osborne 
sells the metal panel that surrounds the radio -- and includes the radio's 
speakers -- for a 1969 Jaguar XKE. Price: $200. "I rebuild water pumps, 
clutches, transmission, I do a lot of engines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Import Motor Parts is able to survive is because some British cars 
are no longer made, and thus are considered collectibles, he said. "The last 
new MG and Triumph you could buy in this country was in 1980," he said. "I've 
seen MGBs go from being a $100 car to a $5,000 and $6,000 car now. So people 
come in and they want all these little pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Osborne's father moved his family from Britain to Southern California in 1954 
because Marty suffered from asthma. His father went to work for a Rolls 
Royce-Jaguar dealership in Pasadena, then bought into Import Motor Parts and 
eventually took over the business. But after the elder Osborne had a stroke in 
1984, Marty Osborne abandoned his goal of going to veterinary school and began 
selling parts full-time. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, Import Motor Parts had sold parts for a variety of foreign cars, 
and had sales of about $720,000 a year and seven employees, Osborne said. But 
when Osborne took over, parts chains such as Chief were mushrooming, and 
Osborne said he concluded "there's no way I can compete with these people." So 
he focused only on British models, kept just one employee to deliver parts, and 
now does about $250,000 in sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne is trying to build his mail-order business, which accounts for 30% of 
his sales. He has a facsimile machine and a toll-free telephone number, and 
gets orders from as far away as New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed he'd keep working even if he won the lottery because "I really love 
what I do." Besides, he said, "I don't have a business to sell really. If I'm 
not here, no one could really do it. It's all in my memory." 
</P>
<P>
John Shankle only tacitly acknowledges it, but his Shankle Engineering in 
Chatsworth, which sells replacement parts for Alfa Romeos, thrives in large 
part because the Alfa is not the most reliable car on earth. 
</P>
<P>
Shankle, 55, diplomatically calls the Italian sports car "more temperamental" 
than most others. "They are really great cars, basically, but they have these 
little idiosyncrasies that crop up," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the workings of their electrical parts "are just totally 
puzzling," Shankle said. "I've often wondered how Marconi invented the radio. I 
think he was trying to design a meat grinder and somehow made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Alfa engines in older models also are notorious for being unable to keep the 
crankcase oil from mixing with the cooling system's water, which causes the 
engine to overheat. So Shankle sells a $46 "sure seal" kit he designed that 
re-routes the oil to reduce the engine pressure that causes the leakage. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these problems, Alfa owners are considered loyal and many tinker with 
their cars enough to keep Shankle Engineering's 10 workers busy, even though 
the market for Alfas is relatively small. His firm figures there are only about 
25,000 to 40,000 Alfas on the road nationwide; by contrast, Honda sold 11,800 
cars in late-June alone. 
</P>
<P>
Shankle bought his first Alfa in 1958, then raced the cars for the next decade. 
An engineer by trade, he started his parts business in 1967 mainly to sell 
racing-type parts to jazz up Alfas. He eventually began selling replacement 
parts as well, and now also sells add-on parts for Hondas. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of Shankle's parts are shipped to mail-order customers, and he 
estimated the firm's sales this year would reach $850,000. He doesn't have to 
look far for competition. To the east in Glendale is Alfa Ricambi, an Alfa 
parts dealer with more than 20,000 replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
But Shankle sees his own market remaining stable. "My hunch is that 20 years 
from now, you won't see many people fussing around with Honda CRXs, but they 
still will be playing with their Alfas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Import Motor Parts is a corner drugstore of parts, Performance Products in 
Van Nuys is a department store. Performance, which sells only parts for 
Porsches, has a cramped but clean front entrance chock-full of neatly displayed 
parts and accessories to tempt walk-in buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Like Shankle Engineering, Performance sells 90% of its parts by mail order, and 
the heart of Performance is in back where it keeps rows of parts stacked 10 
feet high. The firm does not sell used or rebuilt items, only new ones. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a year Performance sends its slick, 170-page catalogue to more than 
200,000 Porsche owners nationwide. Owner Mel Kay's mailing list is compiled 
from names of previous customers and lists of drivers from state department of 
motor vehicle offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Kay asserts that "we're the Nordstrom of the auto-parts business." But he's 
referring more to Nordstrom's renowned attention to service than to the 
department store's size. 
</P>
<P>
Performance Products prospers mainly because Porsche dealers provide only 
grudging help for customers needing parts, said Kay. "The dealers' attitude is 
really what helps us in this business; they don't treat people properly," said 
Kay, who ran a surgical supplies firm before he and a partner bought 
Performance five years ago. The partner has since died, leaving Kay sole owner. 
The firm was started 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Kay, 51, contends he outperforms the dealers by giving refunds, referring 
customers to other dealers if Performance doesn't have the part, talking with 
customers to ensure they are ordering the part they need and undercutting the 
dealers on price. 
</P>
<P>
Kay won't reveal Performance's exact sales, except to say they're less than $10 
million and that the firm is 2 1/2 times bigger than when he took over. 
Regardless, it's clear the firm is a multimillion-dollar business. Performance 
uses computers to monitor its inventory of 5,000 parts, help its 30 employees 
answer questions from callers and help design its semi-annual catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
At Performance, you can buy a starter for a 1955 Porsche 356 for $89.50, or a 
windshield-wiper motor for a 1965 Porsche 911 for $325. How about a plastic 
cover to protect the rear of your Porsche 944's side-view mirrors from flying 
pebbles? Kay sells them for $14.95. 
</P>
<P>
Performance, like many other parts houses, can sell parts for less than car 
dealers because the parts houses usually buy directly from suppliers, Kay said. 
Dealers, by contrast, often buy parts at the end of a long distribution line 
that includes the German supplier, North American distributors and other 
middlemen, all of whom make the part more expensive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kay says he gets all kinds of customers. He recalled the time a Porsche owner 
drove up with a shoe-sized dent in his door. Kay said that when he asked what 
happened the driver said, " 'My girlfriend feels that I treat the car better 
than her. She got so mad she put her foot in the door.' " 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is one way or another cars take a beating, and when they do, 
Kay is ready.

JACK SMITH: THIS EARTH, THIS RELM, THIS ENGLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
England seems to be in a beastly stew over the teaching of English in their 
schools. Since I have not read of it in our paper, this tempest seems not to 
have crossed the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps we are so concerned with the problem in our own schools that we have 
little interest in England's. 
</P>
<P>
It has reached such a pitch, however, that the Prince of Wales himself stunned 
educators and titillated the island kingdom by complaining that English was 
taught "so bloody badly" he had to correct all the letters produced by his own 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
I have been brought up to date on this heroic conflict by a batch of English 
newspaper clippings on the subject sent to me by Herb Lucas of Lompoc on his 
return from an English holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Angered by certain academics who had argued that English could not be taught by 
rote and drilling, Prince Charles thundered: "All the people in my office can't 
speak properly, can't write properly and can't punctuate. I have to correct all 
the letters myself. English is taught so bloody badly. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe English is being taught properly. You cannot educate people 
properly unless you do it on a basic framework and drilling system." 
</P>
<P>
The prince's frustration suggests a fascinating picture of him sitting at his 
desk in exasperation, correcting a misspelled word here, adding a semicolon 
there, excising a misplaced apostrophe, scratching out a solecism, while his 
ensemble of secretaries tremble in the background. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the prince's outburst so shocking, of course, is that one would 
naturally suppose that the very best secretarial help would be available to the 
future king. If the prince's own secretaries can't spell, what shape must the 
rest of the nation's secretarial pool be in! 
</P>
<P>
There are so many dissident factions in the debate -- educators at various 
levels, committees, teachers unions, editors, the secretary of education and a 
National Curriculum Council charged with making recommendations for revising 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
The clippings reflect the gist of that august body's final report, a report so 
tentative, equivocal and fantastical that it might be a sequel to "Alice in 
Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
Its circumlocutions are not easy to understand, but its main thrust seems to be 
that "listening and talking" are more important than "reading and writing," and 
that students should not be taught standard English at the expense of their 
individual dialects. 
</P>
<P>
It holds that non-standard phrases such as "We was," "He ain't," "She come here 
yesterday," "They never saw nobody," and "Theirselves" should be treated as 
"objects of interest and value, and not ridiculed." 
</P>
<P>
Such locutions are not errors, it held, and are not likely to be misunderstood. 
It is "historically inaccurate and conceptually confused," the report said, to 
think of non-standard English as "a distortion or deviation from the purity of 
Standard English." 
</P>
<P>
It recommended that Standard English should not be introduced "at too early a 
stage." It should supplement a pupil's dialect, not replace it. Also, parsing 
sentences, drills and meaningless exercises labeling parts of speech were 
condemned as mechanical and uninteresting. 
</P>
<P>
As for reading, its teaching should be based on "the pleasure principal." 
Secondary pupils might be introduced to such classics as the Authorized Version 
of the Bible, Wordsworth's poems and the novels of Dickens; maybe even 
Shakespeare. However, that did not mean they had to read Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
"The once-traditional method where desk-bound pupils read the text has been 
advantageously replaced by exciting, enjoyable approaches that are social, 
imaginative and physical." These might include films, videotapes, songs and 
dances and dramatic improvisations. Pupils could read books later if they 
wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph, in an editorial, took a dim view of this liberal approach. 
"Any school wishing to equip its pupils well for modern life must know that 
eradicating their non-standard forms and solecisms, and imparting to them a 
command of language, are the best means to this end. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigel de Gruchy, deputy general secretary of the National Assn. of 
Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, suggested that Prince Charles 
probably did not pay his help enough to get people who could spell. 
</P>
<P>
"If he has to swear," de Gruchy said, "he is proving that the public schools 
are as bad as the state ones. It is a case of the pot calling the kettle 
black." 
</P>

ART BUCHWALD: THE NORTH-POINDEXTER-REAGAN SCENARIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reason Ollie North did not get any time in the big house is because the 
judge said that he believed Ollie was really a dupe of higher-ups in the U.S. 
government. In rounding up the usual suspects, the only superiors that anyone 
in Washington can come up with are John Poindexter and President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Ollie was not only a dupe, he was also a pawn in the Iran-Contra affair, a U.S. 
Marine who didn't know right from wrong or good Iranians from bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
That Ollie was flimflammed by people in the White House goes without saying. 
The how is something else again. This is the way I believe it happened. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime back when Congress voted against the United States supporting the 
Contras, President Reagan called Ollie into the Oval Office. Poindexter was 
also there, sending up large clouds of smoke so it was difficult to see the 
President behind his desk. 
</P>
<P>
The President, reading from 3-by-5 cards, said: "Ollie, I consider you a hero." 
</P>
<P>
"Why is that?" Ollie asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Because by the time we finish duping you, your feet will be held to the fire, 
but you will not cry uncle." 
</P>
<P>
Ollie said, "I'll do anything you say because you are my commander-in-chief. 
Besides, I like this job because you can order around anybody in the country, 
and you get to work late with a small but good-looking staff of people who 
think the way we do." 
</P>
<P>
The President was pleased with the answer. "All we want you to do is trade guns 
for hostages and collect money that will be deposited in Switzerland, where it 
will then be placed in a paper bag and delivered to Contras in Florida, who 
will see that it gets to Honduras, where it will be taken to Nicaragua. Does 
that sound like much of a problem?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, sir. We used to do that at the Naval Academy every morning." 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter puffed even harder on his pipe. "Ollie, all we are asking is that 
you be the fall guy." 
</P>
<P>
"Sounds good to me. What do I get out of it?" Ollie asked. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter looked at a sheaf of papers. "A $150,000 fine, 1,200 hours of 
community service and two years probation." 
</P>
<P>
"What about a pardon?" 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said, "I can't do that or it will look as if I knew what you were 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter added, "As far as the judge will be concerned you are an overzealous 
underling who exceeded your authority in your patriotic mission to rid Central 
America of Communists. Because you are a sacrificial lamb to those of us in the 
Administration, you will always be entitled to a standing ovation by those who 
believe you should never have been involved in our dirty little scheme in the 
first place." 
</P>
<P>
Ollie said, "You've done so much for me. Is there anything I can do for you?" 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter answered, "I may be tried for being your superior and giving you the 
orders to do the things you will do. I would appreciate it if you denied I had 
anything to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Ollie said, "But if I do that, that means the one responsible will be President 
Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't bother me," the President said, laughing. "Nothing in this job ever 
has."

THE DRUG CLINIC: IF YOU DON'T DRINK, IS THAT HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOSEPH A. PURSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is being a nondrinker hazardous to your health? That's what many recovering 
alcoholics, along with those who are abstinent for other reasons, have asked me 
over the years. Their concern continues to be fueled by articles that say that 
moderate drinkers have a longer life expectancy than abstainers or heavy 
drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
This trouble started in the 1970s when scientific journals began to report that 
moderate drinkers had fewer heart attacks than abstainers. This was thought to 
be due to the fact that moderate drinkers have higher levels of HDL cholesterol 
than do nondrinkers. HDL became known as "good" cholesterol because it was 
thought to protect the blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
The media version of the scientific rationale went like this: Alcohol in the 
bloodstream causes an increase in HDL. Serving as a coating agent, HDL protects 
the coronary artery walls of drinkers against atherosclerosis. From this it 
followed that moderate drinkers lived longer because they had less 
atherosclerosis and fewer heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Recovering alcoholics and other nondrinkers drew no comfort from the fact that 
heavy drinkers, those who exceed a safe limit of about two drinks a day, seem 
to lose this alcohol-related HDL benefit. Plotted on a graph, the scientific 
findings suggested that the relationship between mortality and drinking was a 
U-shaped curve. Abstainers and heavy drinkers alike were dying at the tips of 
the U, while moderate drinkers safely snuggled at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, several studies revealed that these arguments were not 
conclusive. It was true that moderate drinking increased HDL. But the increase 
was in the HDL-3 fraction, a subtype of HDL which, it turned out, does not 
protect blood vessels. HDL-2, another subtype, is what protects arteries, we 
were told. One study reported in the December, 1988, issue of Lancet shed still 
more light on the subject. In a follow-up study of almost 8,000 men over a 
period of 7 1/2 years it became clear that many of the nondrinkers on the 
U-shaped curve were actually patients who "already had heart disease" when they 
entered the study. 
</P>

The implication was that these abstainers were actually patients who, in AA 
vernacular, would be known as "white knucklers." They were people who had 
"given up" alcohol either because they were worried about their health or 
because they had proof that they had already developed heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
The new thinking was that hard drinkers may die early because of alcohol-damage 
to their health in general; and abstainers may die early because many of them 
are "white-knuckling it," which means they are leading highly stressed lives. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not all. Other similar studies suggested that a number of the deaths 
occurring in the abstainer group had nothing to do with coronary artery 
disease. Such deaths often occurred in recovering alcoholics who, during their 
period of hard drinking, had caused irreparable damage to organs other than 
their heart, and that damage ultimately caused their statistically early death. 
Like high mileage automobiles, some of them wore out before their time. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, welcome news that it would be to moderate drinkers, and fatal news that 
it has been for recovering alcoholics and other abstainers, moderate drinking 
appears not to be protective against coronary artery disease. HDL-2 is now the 
good cholesterol. And HDL-2 is not produced by alcohol but rather by exercise. 
But bending your elbow and tilting your head is not enough. It takes a more 
vigorous type, such as jogging.

REFLECTION ON A SCIENTIFIC LIFE LACKS THE BIG PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the Love of Enzymes: The Odyssey of a Biochemist by Arthur Kornberg 
(Harvard University Press: $29.95; 336 pages; illustrated) 
</P>
<P>
Scientists who write autobiographical memoirs face a critical decision at the 
outset: Should they concentrate on the science they did or on the life they 
led? The answer they reach probably rests as much on temperament as on any 
conscious decision, but it determines what kind of book results and to whom it 
will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The same question arises in one form or another in all popular science writing. 
Who is the reader and how much should the writer assume he knows? The trick is 
to write in a way that satisfies professional scientists as well as interested 
laymen. Like most ideals, reality almost always falls short of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
It is particularly hard for scientists to write about science for general 
readers. With several notable exceptions, scientists tend to write too 
narrowly, assuming too much about their readers' knowledge and their interest 
in every jot of the research. Scientists tend to write for other scientists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Role in DNA Development 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Kornberg, a Noble-Prize-winning biochemist who has played a major role 
in the development and application of our knowledge of DNA, falls into that 
trap. His autobiography, "For the Love of Enzymes," is a well-written history 
of the field and his role in it, full of explanations of the science itself and 
clear-eyed observations about the process of research. 
</P>
<P>
Readers will find here the first-rate mind of a first-rate scientist, and there 
is pleasure in that. It is rare to read such a lucid account of epoch-making 
science. 
</P>
<P>
But the book is curiously devoid of feeling. Kornberg, a professor of 
biochemistry at Stanford Medical School, is obviously passionate about his work 
and about the pleasures of figuring out how nature works. But his book is about 
science rather than scientists, about problems rather than personalities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Thin Chapter 
</P>
<P>
Even his last chapter -- "Reflections on My Life and Science" -- is 
surprisingly thin. "It is the essence of scientific discipline to ask small, 
humble, and answerable questions," Kornberg writes. "Instead of reaching for 
the whole truth, the scientist examines small, defined, clearly separable 
phenomena. The pattern of science is a step-wise extension of what came before. 
Whereas the doctor must treat the whole patient, and at once, the scientist can 
isolate the smallest facet that intrigues him and grapple with it for as long 
as it takes." 
</P>
<P>
Probably without knowing it, in that paragraph Kornberg reveals much about 
himself. He is given to understatement rather than overstatement, to small 
issues rather than large ones, to narrow interpretations rather than broad 
pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
In that same concluding chapter, Kornberg chronicles and complains about the 
anti-Semitism that was endemic and taken for granted in American science a 
generation or two ago. As a result of it, he was denied admission to all but 
one of the medical schools he applied to in 1937, when he graduated from City 
College of New York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Commendable Trait 
</P>
<P>
He was accepted to the University of Rochester Medical School, but he was 
denied an important fellowship and other academic honors after he got there. He 
tells us he is still angry about this injustice, but his words are measured and 
show no anger. 
</P>
<P>
Caution is a commendable trait in a scientist, but it is unsatisfying in a life 
history of a man who has accomplished a great deal as a scientist, teacher, 
author and department chairman. Perhaps as much as any other researcher, 
Kornberg has pushed back the frontiers of knowledge about the chemistry of 
life. His book deals splendidly with that, but it would be a better book if it 
dealt as splendidly with him.

Iron Butterfly never made it to the stage at Woodstock -- its helicopter 
couldn't land in the sea of humanity. But the band has been added to the "20 
Years After" festival being held nearly two decades to the day after Woodstock, 
Aug. 19-20 at the Cal State Dominguez Hills Velodrome. Woodstock vets Blood, 
Sweat &amp; Tears and Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company also have been 
added to a lineup that includes Richie Havens, John Sebastian, Country Joe 
McDonald, Canned Heat and Melanie. To enhance the mood, the event will feature 
a '60s-style arts and crafts fair with tie-dyed shirts and body painting.

Campaigners suffered a legal setback Monday in their fight to save the 
foundations of the 16th-Century Rose Theatre in London where William 
Shakespeare is believed to have acted. A High Court judge rejected an appeal by 
the Rose Theatre Trust of the government's refusal to make the ruins a national 
monument and prevent new building on the site. The government last month backed 
developers' plans to construct an office block on giant stilts above the 
theater, whose remains were discovered earlier this year. It argued the remains 
would not be damaged and there was no need to give them the extra protection of 
national-monument status. Monday's ruling upheld the decision, to the 
disappointment of the members of the Rose Theatre Trust campaign, whose 
supporters included the late Laurence Olivier, who died last week at the age of 
82. "It was Lord Olivier's last wish, his last public pronouncement, that the 
Rose be preserved and displayed in the best possible way -- obviously not with 
an office block over it," said actor James Fox. ALEENE MacMINN

TURMOIL IN CHINA PLUCKS STRINGS FROM USIU GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last month's political upheaval in the People's Republic of China sent shock 
waves through at least one of San Diego's musical institutions. Music director 
Zoltan Rozsnyai's 3-year-old International Orchestra at United States 
International University has depended heavily on Chinese musicians. On the 
orchestra's current roster, nearly all of the string players and more than half 
of the total -- 26 out of 46 -- are from China. 
</P>
<P>
According to USIU official Helen-Maria Erewan, the university may no longer be 
able to count on a steady supply of Chinese players. 
</P>
<P>
"There are at least four musicians back in China who were to play in the 
International Orchestra this coming season who are still trying to get here," 
Erewan said. "They had all the necessary paper work prior to the Tian An Men 
Square crisis, but now they are having serious difficulties getting out of 
China." 
</P>
<P>
One fortunate Chinese musician, Beijing violinist Zhang Min, arrived at USIU on 
June 14. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, Min's paper work to come here to play in the orchestra went back 
a year and a half," said Erewan. "We were all surprised that someone from 
Beijing made it out. They let him come for a two-year stay, although he had to 
give an affirmative answer to the question, 'Will you be returning to China?' " 
</P>
<P>
The International Orchestra's season ended last night with a concert at the 
Spreckels Organ pavilion, where it performed with civic organist Robert 
Plimpton. Before the recent crises in Beijing, all of the orchestra's Chinese 
players had made plans to visit families and friends in China following this 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
"None will be going now," said Erewan, "because they are afraid they will not 
be allowed to leave again. They accept this with a kind of stoic cheerfulness, 
but their personal distress is acute." 
</P>
<P>
Erewan added that, because of the political situation in China, six Chinese 
players who have just completed their two-year stint with the International 
Orchestra have decided to remain here and seek positions in North American 
orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
Up, up and away. Thursday morning, 65 singers from the San Diego Master Chorale 
will depart for a two-week musical tour of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 
According to music director Frank Almond, the highlight of the tour will be the 
opportunity to sing Mozart's "Coronation" Mass at Salzburg Cathedral's Sunday 
morning high Mass. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference last week, Almond explained that the Salzburg cathedral 
is the church where the "Coronation" Mass was first performed. He might also 
have noted that Mozart wrote the work while in the service of Salzburg's 
Archbishop Colloredo, the autocratic cleric who later dismissed Mozart by 
kicking him down the Episcopal Palace's long flight of stairs. 
</P>
<P>
In Vienna, the San Diego choral ensemble will present a sacred concert in St. 
Peter's Church, a gem of Baroque architecture nestled in the shadow of Vienna's 
St. Stephen's Cathedral. Almond noted that the Roman Catholic church's new 
canon laws have placed strict limitations on his programming. The master 
chorale is restricted to singing nothing but sacred music, and the must perform 
from the rear gallery, rather than sing from risers in front of the high altar. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Mozart mass and the Faure Requiem, Almond is bringing a 
triptych of American sacred music for European ears: Charles Ives' "Serenity," 
local composer David Ward-Steinman's "Creation," and several hymns from the 
"Sacred Harp," a collection of early 19th-Century American sacred music. 
</P>
<P>
That's the ticket: If it appears that San Diego Symphony administrators are 
smiling more these days, it's for a good reason. In a word, the pops is hot. A 
record 17,500 people heard the orchestra's "Americana Salute" program, which 
the symphony played seven times during the first week of July. Contrasted with 
the opening three weeks of last season's summer concerts at Hospitality Point, 
attendance is up 45% and ticket income has jumped 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Besides beefing up its marketing, the orchestra is clearly offering the public 
more of what it wants to hear. 
</P>
<P>
"We surveyed SummerPops subscribers at the end of last season, and their 
preferences are directly reflected in this season's mixture of light classics, 
Big Band and Broadway programs," said Wesley O. Brustad, the symphony's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the current summer season with its big Tchaikovsky program, the 
SummerPops has been playing more real orchestral music, much to the evident 
approval of ticket buyers. This programming has also boosted the players' 
morale, which has tended to sag under weeks of playing bland backup 
arrangements for pop singers. 
</P>
<P>
New digs: San Diego Symphony music director-designate Yoav Talmi will 
temporarily trade his baton for ceremonial scissors at 12:45 p.m. today, when 
he and orchestra officials cut the ribbon for new ticket offices in Symphony 
Towers. After two years of dodging construction equipment and scaffolding to 
get to the orchestra's temporary box office on the 7th Avenue side of Symphony 
Hall, the new box office in the marble-clad foyer of Symphony Towers is nothing 
short of palatial. Starting this fall, the main entrance to Symphony Hall will 
also be through this foyer at 700 B St. The new box office will be open from 10 
a.m.-6 p.m. Tuesday through Friday.

KID BEAT: 'MAX &amp; ZOEY' KEEPS ACTION MOVING FOR YOUNG CHILDREN

Toddler-friendly, as simple as a four-page baby book, "Max &amp; Zoey, Zoey 
&amp; Max" at the Back Alley Theatre is a pleasant, professional action play -- 
actually two plays in one -- for the youngest members of the family. 
</P>
<P>
Husband-and-wife writing team Dion Alden Holt and Will Holt offer the 
adventures of two 4-year-olds (portrayed by adult actors Terri Girvin and Ken 
Hoit) as they discover the world of chicken pox and the mystery of scary night 
noises. Lisa Gates is both narrator and mom. 
</P>
<P>
The cast is polished -- any parent would recognize Girvin's 4-year-old fidgets 
-- and the olts' musical score is humorous, if not particularly tuneful. Action 
is the key ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
While waiting for the show to begin, children are invited to come up on a 
small, T-shaped runway and make building-block towers with the actors. 
Participation continues during the play as audience members answer questions 
from the cast, play tug of war onstage and join a high-spirited chorus of sound 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
The simplicity of Gretchen Corbett's staging keeps things free-flowing (an 
accomplishment of some note, since she has had to use the florid purple barroom 
setting designed by Deborah Raymond and Dorian Vernacchio for the theater's 
current adult play, "Gloria Duplex: An Erotic Worship Service for Theatre"). 
Lawrence Oberman provided the atmospheric lighting. 
</P>
<P>
It all lasts about 45 minutes -- short and sweet enough not to challenge the 
staying power of young children or their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 At 15231 Burbank Blvd. in Van Nuys, Saturdays and Sundays at 11 a.m. and 1 
p.m., through Aug. 6. Reopens Aug. 26 through Sept. 17. Tickets are $6.50.

A HISTORY LESSON AT THE BEACH

Like a poster painter or a muralist, any performance artist who brings a 
program to a sunny, crowded beach is wise to grab viewers' attention with 
bright colors and simple outlines. Still, no one would confuse the folks whose 
designs brighten up city walls with the great masters of the mural. 
</P>
<P>
Presented by the SMARTS Festival in collaboration with the Cactus Foundation, 
Linda J. Albertano offered a mini-history of California on Saturday afternoon 
at Ocean Park Beach in Santa Monica. Called "Calisaladia," the event was big on 
multi-ethnic perspective and a homey sort of pageantry. Memorable movement, 
text or imagery were in shorter supply. 
</P>
<P>
A man in American Indian garb (Harrison Lowe) who did some ritual business with 
a large feather was followed by flagellant monks in scary masks and red robes 
snaking across the sand. Then came more Indians in tall black masks whirling 
with black flags, a covey of children holding pinatas and doing a solemn 
one-step, a body builder (Johnny Pequingnot) flexing away next to a state flag, 
members of the East-West Youth Foundation in a Chinese lion dance, accompanied 
by the vigorous clashes of pots and pans. 
</P>
<P>
A collage of voice-overs alluded to the Japanese-American internment during 
World War II, and a group of women smartly executed karate moves to the sound 
of bombers. Keith Antar Mason grandly declaimed a hard-to-follow poem that 
seemed to be about the black urban experience. And Albertano, a tall figure in 
black, sang in English and Spanish and presided benignly over the whole 
good-natured grab bag. CATHY CURTIS

A HAUNTING ACCOUNT OF DEATH OF VINCENT CHIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, Times Television Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"P.O.V." -- the PBS series that showcases the work of independent nonfiction 
film makers -- launches its second season tonight with a haunting, disturbing 
and utterly compelling account of a multilayered tragedy: 
</P>
<P>
The time was volatile. Despairing and frustrated about rising unemployment, 
many Detroit auto workers blamed their economic woes on the auto-giant Japanese 
and, by extension, other Asians, including those who were U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese-American engineer Vincent Chin was soon to be married. So, as he left 
his Detroit home on a steamy summer evening in 1982 to unwind with a friend at 
a topless bar named Fancy Pants, he promised his reproachful mother it would be 
"the last time." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't say last time," Lily Chin cautioned her 27-year-old son. "It's bad 
luck." 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, Chin was clubbed to death with a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
Airing at 10 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15, "Who Killed Vincent Chin?" is 
misleadingly titled, asking a question for which there is already an answer. 
</P>
<P>
The killer was Ron Ebens, a middle-aged auto plant superintendent who that 
night had confrontations with Chin inside and outside Fancy Pants. Ebens and 
his stepson, Michael Nitz, later stalked and found Chin and a friend at a 
nearby McDonald's, where Nitz held Chin while Ebens beat the helpless victim 
with the bat. Four days later, Chin died. 
</P>
<P>
The broad facts were never in dispute. Instead, the enigmas central to the Chin 
case concerned the motivation for the killing -- was it racial? -- and the 
nature of a legal system under which Ebens and Nitz were able to elude jail 
despite their initial guilty pleas. 
</P>
<P>
After plea-bargaining reduced the second-degree murder charge against them to 
manslaughter, each was sentenced to three years' probation and fined $3,750. 
</P>
<P>
On the screen, Judge Charles Kaufman justifies his light sentence with an 
explanation that sounds muddled and unsatisfactory: 
</P>
<P>
"The victim lingered for four days, which . . . was indicative to me that they 
attempted to administer a punishment. They did this too severely, in careless 
disregard of human life, which is what manslaughter is. . . . Had it been a 
brutal murder, of course these fellas would be in jail by now." 
</P>
<P>
"Who Killed Vincent Chin?" was nominated for an Academy Award this year, and 
with good reason. Shrewdly saving their revelations for the end, film makers 
Christine Choy and Renee Tajima craftily and tantalizingly present the Chin 
case "Rashomon"-style against the music of heavy industry and Motown in 
work-hard, play-hard Motor City. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to us and telling conflicting stories are voices from both sides -- 
family, friends, lawyers, witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Ebens and Lily Chin (even more than Vincent) are the clashing protagonists 
here, becoming striking visual metaphors for the ethnic and economic 
underpinnings of this important, powerfully told story: 
</P>
<P>
The boyishly engaging auto worker sits beside his supportive All-American wife 
in their All-American home, while the victim's mother, so pathetically 
distraught she is barely able to talk, squeezes off short, halting sentences in 
heavily broken English. Her emotions, so raw and pure, speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Was Vincent Chin the casualty of a drunken brawl or a racial vendetta? Is the 
proper question: What killed Vincent Chin? If so, is the proper answer: A 
society that tolerates, and even abets racism? 
</P>
<P>
Ebens and Nitz were later tried twice on federal civil rights charges in this 
case, which lingered five years. Now, helped by this film, the memory lingers 
even longer.

JIM MURRAY: NOT ONLY DOES HE UNDERSTAND, HE SHOWS HE CARES 
</P>

<P>
Too often, the major league ballplayer is portrayed as a churlish, graceless 
individual who comes into public view brushing the little kid autograph seeker 
aside, refusing to pose for pictures, announcing irritatedly that all he owes 
his public is a .293 average or an appearance at a baseball card show for which 
he gets $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
There are, to be sure, a few who fit this unflattering image. They take the $2 
million and run. The fans' love is unrequited. The record books sometime 
identify these worthies as most valuable players. The public concept of what 
these letters stand for is quite different. 
</P>
<P>
So, it gives me great pleasure today to check in with a different kind of a 
story, the account of a major league player who belongs to the world at large, 
is a citizen in good standing with the rest of the community, a man who cares. 
</P>
<P>
So far as I know, Jim Abbott is the only man in a big league uniform ever to 
win the Sullivan Award as the nation's outstanding amateur athlete. He's the 
only one in a big league uniform who only has one hand. Jim Abbott is the only 
reason I know of to be glad there's a designated hitter rule in the American 
League. 
</P>
<P>
We all know what kind of pitcher Jim Abbott is -- eight wins, six losses, 62 
strikeouts in 101 2/3 innings, an ERA of 3.45. But I have a clipping from an 
Indianapolis newspaper that shows what kind of a person he is. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances require a bit of explanation. On the morning of April 17, 
little 5-year-old Erin Bower went with her mother to the local K mart store in 
the Castleton Farms section of Indianapolis. There was this tube of toothpaste 
on the counter. Erin picked it up. It exploded. Some cretin with a grudge 
against the store -- or the world -- had placed a bomb in it. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't kill Erin. It just blew off her left hand. You don't even want to 
think about it. 
</P>
<P>
In all the outpouring of sympathy for little Erin, one letter came marked with 
the logo of the California Angels. It read: 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Erin: 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps somewhere later in your lifetime you will properly understand this 
letter and the feelings that go behind it. Regardless, I wanted to send 
something along now after being made aware of your terrible accident. 
</P>
<P>
"As your parents have probably told you, I was born without a right hand. That 
automatically made me different from the other kids I was around. But you know 
what? It made me different only in their eyes. You see, I figured that's what 
the good Lord wanted me to work with. So it was my responsibility to become as 
good as I could at whatever I chose to do, regardless of my handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"I just won my first major league game. When the final out was made, a lot of 
things went through my mind. I thought of my parents and all the help they 
provided; my brother and his support; and all of my friends along the way. The 
only thing, Erin, that I didn't pay attention to was my handicap. You see, it 
had nothing to do with anything. 
</P>
<P>
"You're a young lady now with a tremendous life ahead of you. Whether you want 
to be an athlete, a doctor, lawyer or anything else, it will be up to you, and 
only you, how far you go. Certainly there will be some tough times ahead, but 
with dedication and love of life, you'll be successful in any field you choose. 
I'll look forward to reading about you in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Again, my best, Jim Abbott, California Angels." 
</P>
<P>
Now that, you have to say, is the way to get an autograph. And the news from 
Indianapolis, as reported in the Star, is good: Erin, who turned 6 today, has 
been fitted with an electrically-powered hand at the Medical Prosthetics Center 
in Houston. It'll do everything a real hand will do -- except throw the curve. 
If Erin wants to do that, she'll have to learn to do it with her other hand. As 
Jim Abbott has shown, that's no problem.

NFL PLAY TO BE BASIS FOR LOTTERY; 
</P>
<P>
OREGON APPROVES CONTEST DECIDED BY POINT SPREADS

<P>
The Oregon Lottery Commission approved rules Monday for a new game that makes 
Oregon the only state with a lottery contest based on National Football League 
point spreads. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, on a 5-0 vote, endorsed the game despite the objections of an 
NFL attorney, who said the action would harm the integrity of professional 
football. No further approval is needed for the lottery, and ticket sales are 
to begin Sept. 6 for the NFL's first week of games on Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the game, called Sports Action, are to go to Oregon college and 
university intercollegiate sports programs, which currently do not receive 
state funding. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Oregon Legislature approved a bill calling on the Lottery Commission 
to create a sports-oriented game to generate money for college sports. Oregon 
Lottery director Jim Davey and the lottery staff put together the specifics of 
the NFL contest. 
</P>
<P>
Davey estimates the game will generate between $4 million and $9 million each 
year for Oregon intercollegiate sports. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic directors at Oregon and Oregon State say state aid is essential if the 
schools are to remain in the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
In the football lottery, a $1 investment will allow players to predict the 
outcome of some or all of the 14 weekly NFL games against the point spreads set 
by Nevada oddsmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Under rules of the game, players will try to predict the outcome of four to 14 
games against the point spreads. The more games they bet, the more money they 
could win, from about $8 for a perfect four-game card to about $8,000 for a 
perfect 14-game card. 
</P>
<P>
NFL attorney Jim Noel told the commission the game would create a situation in 
which fans are more interested in point spreads than how their favorite teams 
fare. 
</P>
<P>
Noel said the league is concerned that Oregon "is on the brink of triggering a 
nationwide trend." 
</P>
<P>
"The entire nation is watching," he said. "Lottery officials in other states 
have stated publicly that if Oregon does this successfully, they will try it, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Noel also said the NFL would consider legal action to block the contest. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come out here to threaten anyone," he said. "There are some very 
viable legal issues here that we're going to evaluate." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL took Delaware to court when that state tried a football betting game, 
but the lawsuit became moot after Delaware gave up its game after one season in 
1974 because it lost money. 
</P>
<P>
In approving the new game, Lottery Commission members noted that betting on 
professional sports already is widespread in Oregon and around the country. 
</P>
<P>
They said many people take part in office football pools or bet on games 
through bookmakers, either illegally or through operations in Nevada, the only 
state that allows gambling on team sports. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do in Oregon is pick up a phone and place a bet," Davey said. 
"People do it every day." 
</P>
<P>
Commission member Mike Schwartz of Eugene said he thinks the NFL should embrace 
the idea as an opportunity to market professional football to new audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"It will make people more excited about NFL football," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
Noel rejected that argument, and said the NFL does not want to see an expansion 
of gambling on professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
"The net effect of the Oregon Lottery game will be to increase the overall 
volume of betting on NFL football," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials have said the game could later be expanded to include 
National Basketball Assn. games. 
</P>
<P>
In his appearance before the commission, Noel read statements from the NBA and 
Major League baseball saying they oppose the football lottery on the same 
grounds as the NFL.

IN RED'S BOOK, TEAMS OF TODAY DON'T RATE WITH ALL-TIME BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Just past the midpoint of a season in which the Dodgers are shakily defending a 
World Series championship, baseball's best teams might be the Oakland Athletics 
and San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
But how do these two compare with the better champions of the century? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is, they don't -- at least not yet -- if you're consulting Arthur E. 
(Red) Patterson, who has been following the game for about 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently an Angel executive, Patterson, 80, began as a sportswriter for 
the old New York Herald-Tribune before moving to the New York Yankees and then 
the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"My test is continuity -- the ability to repeat as a pennant winner," he said, 
noting that there have been no repeaters in the decade since 1977-78, when the 
Dodgers and Yankees met in successive Octobers. "I think baseball is more 
interesting now than ever, and the clubs today are better balanced than they 
were 30 or 40 years ago, but there has only been one great team in the last 
quarter century." 
</P>
<P>
That, he said, was Charlie O. Finley's 1972-73-74 A's, who rank third in 
Patterson's all-time top 10. 
</P>
<P>
On top are two Yankee machines, the 1926-27-28 clubs with Babe Ruth and Lou 
Gehrig, and the multiple champions of the 1930s and early '40s, the players who 
won so many pennants and World Series that they inspired an American League war 
cry: "Break up the Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
In Patterson's top 10 -- a collection of 10 champions that all meet his 
criteria -- the first five are the 1927 Yankees, 1939 Yankees, 1974 A's, 1951 
Yankees and 1922 New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
His next five: the 1929 Philadelphia A's, 1955 Dodgers, 1963 Dodgers, 1907 
Chicago Cubs and 1916 Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest regret is that there isn't room there for the St. Louis Gas House 
Gang," he said, naming the 1934 Cardinals 11th and following with the 1913 A's, 
1931 Cardinals, 1940 Cincinnati Reds and 1936 Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The overriding irony of baseball in this century, Patterson said, is the 
increasingly high quality of the modern game combined with the possibility that 
there won't be another team to compare with those now in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Free agency and the draft have made it a new game," he said, mentioning the 
revolutionary baseball changes that took root in the 1970s, tearing apart, 
among others, Finley's Oakland champions. "These days, you can't put together 
dynasty-type players and keep them together. 
</P>
<P>
"The draft is the biggest change. In the great days of the Yankees in the '30s, 
'40s, and '50s, all they had to do was identify the nation's outstanding young 
prospects -- that is, scout them -- and sign them. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you have to scout them, draft them, and sign them. That makes an enormous 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
He noted Joe DiMaggio, a Hall of Famer who might have gone to a Yankee rival in 
a 1930s draft. 
</P>
<P>
Or, Patterson said: "If there'd been free agency, someone would have picked him 
off, most likely, for a million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the game is now, if you think you win the pennant with one more proven 
player, you grab him as a free agent -- and there goes somebody else's 
dynasty." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson approves, nonetheless, of the modern way. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is a fan's delight today," he said. "Baseball has never been so well 
played. The talk about the dilution of talent with so many teams is just plain 
wrong. Baseball could easily expand again. 
</P>
<P>
"Pro basketball and football have siphoned off some players, of course. That 
never used to happen. And TV has knocked out some of the minor leagues. But 
despite all that, there's so much talent now and such good coaching, in the 
colleges as well as the minors, that the game keeps getting better. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the superstars who are remembered from the past. Today, every baseball 
roster is stronger, down through the 23rd or 24th man, than they used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson is an expert on what used to be. He's been a close student of the big 
leagues since age 12, when an uncle took him to his first game, a Dodger-Giant 
game at the Polo Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1946 he joined the Yankees for eight years as road secretary, publicist and 
home run tape measurer. Then he spent 20 years with the Dodgers in Brooklyn and 
Los Angeles before taking over as president of the Angels in 1975. He remains 
an Angel consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson, who went to night school at New York University when he was working 
days for the Herald-Tribune, was one of four sons of a New York area mill 
superintendent. He and his wife, residents of Fullerton, have five children, 15 
grandchildren and a great grandchild, most of them baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
He said the 1907 Cubs and 1916 Red Sox are the only great teams of the century 
that he never personally scouted. 
</P>
<P>
The top 10: 
</P>
<P>
1927 YANKEES 
</P>
<P>
The quotes are Patterson's: 
</P>
<P>
"You can always get lucky once. So you've got to do it more than once to meet 
the test of greatness. Secondly, you can't embarrass yourself in the World 
Series. Those are the two things I think about first. 
</P>
<P>
"In the '20s, (Manager) Miller Huggins' Yankees qualified in both respects, 
winning three straight pennants and then the World Series in '27 and '28." 
</P>
<P>
Along with most old-timers, Patterson ranks the 1927 Yankees as the century's 
No. 1 ballclub, in large part because Ruth hit his 60 home runs that year, and 
Gehrig hit 47 and batted in 175 runs. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1927, the Yankees won 110 games in a 154-game season. That's dominance, 
that's greatness." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth's teammates in the 1927 outfield were Earle Combs, whose lifetime-best 231 
hits led the league that season, and Bob Meusel, whose .337 batting average and 
.510 slugging average were also career bests. 
</P>
<P>
For the second of many times, first baseman Gehrig played every game. Second 
baseman Tony Lazzeri hit .309. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dugan was at third for the 1927 Yankees, with Mark Koenig at shortstop, as 
Pat Collins caught 92 games, Benny Bengough 31. 
</P>
<P>
Waite Hoyt was the ace of an old staff that put it together for one last season 
in 1927, which turned out to be the final year in the majors for Urban Shocker 
(18-3), Dutch Ruether (13-6) and Bob Shawkey (2-3). Shocker died at 38 a year 
later. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast there was a rookie reliever, Wilcy Moore, who in his only big 
season in baseball had a 19-7 record with a 2.28 earned-run average in 50 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyt, who began his 21-year career in the majors in 1918, led the league's 
starters with 22-7 and 2.63. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Pennock, the Knight of Kennett Square, who started his 22-year career in 
1912, finished 19-8. He was never to win that many again. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth came back to hit 54 home runs in 1928, when he and Gehrig led the league 
with 142 runs batted in apiece. That sort of reprise impresses Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
1939 YANKEES 
</P>
<P>
"Gehrig was still a force on the club when the Yankees started another streak 
under (Manager) Joe McCarthy, and this time they won pennants in 1932, '36, 
'37, '38, '39, '41, '42 and '43. That's four straight in the '30s and three 
straight in the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
"And in all those seasons, they lost only one World Series. The Cardinals beat 
them in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball had never seen such a dominant team. In the four World Series played 
from 1936 through 1939, the Yankees lost a total of only three games. They 
swept the Cubs in '38 and the Reds in '39." 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through McCarthy's streak, the 1939 club was his best, in Patterson's 
view. 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio led the league with a career-high .381 batting average in 1939, when a 
rookie outfielder, Charlie (King Kong) Keller, hit a career-high .324 and when 
the other outfielder, George Selkirk, hit .306. 
</P>
<P>
At third base, Red Rolfe had his biggest year, batting .329 and leading the 
league in runs, hits and doubles. Joe Gordon was at second, Frankie Crosetti at 
short. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame catcher, Bill Dickey, hit .302. 
</P>
<P>
Red Ruffing (21-7) matched his peak season on a staff with four other pitchers 
who each won 12 or 13 games -- Atley Donald, Lefty Gomez, Bump Hadley and Monte 
Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
"The most poignant of baseball stories began one night in the spring of 1939 
when Joe McCarthy walked in to talk to the writers in the dining room of the 
Book Cadillac Hotel in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"He told us: 'I think I have a story for you fellows. Lou Gehrig has asked to 
come out of the lineup.' 
</P>
<P>
"Lou had played in 2130 consecutive games. He never played again. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, nobody knew how ill he was, although we thought it was serious. 
When he carried the lineup card out to the plate that summer, he could hardly 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
"This inspired the team. Even with Babe Dahlgren instead of Gehrig at first 
base, that became the greatest Yankee team of my time. 
</P>
<P>
"That first game at Detroit was typical. Guys were crying as they walked out to 
bat. That day they would have beaten any team that ever played. They beat 
Detroit, 22-2." 
</P>
<P>
1974 OAKLAND A's 
</P>
<P>
"These days you can no longer build a ballclub the way Charlie Finley built the 
1970s A's -- which was also the way the old Yankees were put together. 
</P>
<P>
"Shrewd scouting was the main thing it took. You didn't have to compete with 
other front offices in the draft. And you didn't have to worry about losing a 
superstar to free agency. 
</P>
<P>
"So the 1974 A's were baseball's last great team. Except for the A's, there 
hasn't been a great one since the 1963 Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who did much of the scouting himself, helped round up a group that won 
a record five straight division championships for Oakland starting in 1971. The 
string only ended in 1976 when the entrepreneurial era ended in baseball as the 
draft and free agency took hold, balancing up the teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The (1972-73-74) A's met the two tests for greatness we've been talking about. 
In successive years, they won more than one pennant, distancing themselves from 
the field. And they never disgraced themselves in the World Series." 
</P>
<P>
In fact they won pennants and three World Series in three consecutive years, in 
addition to winning five straight division titles. 
</P>
<P>
The 1974 A's, with Catfish Hunter pitching a league-leading 25 wins with a 
league-leading ERA, went on to blitz the Dodgers in a five-game Series. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, Ken Holtzman and John (Blue Moon) Odom won the last three straight that 
October, after which neither the A's nor baseball was ever the same. 
</P>
<P>
It was a pitchers' team that Finley built. Hunter averaged more than 22 wins in 
1972-73-74, while Holtzman averaged nearly 20. Vida Blue, after winning 24 as a 
rookie in 1971, slumped to 6-10 the next season after a long contract squabble 
with Finley, but came back to win 17 in 1973 and 20 in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Relief star Rollie Fingers appeared in a league-leading 76 games in 1974, and 
in three years averaged 20 saves. 
</P>
<P>
In all three years, there was only one .300 hitter, outfielder Joe Rudi, who 
got up there only once in an era when .318 could lead the league. 
</P>
<P>
The power came from Reggie Jackson, who averaged 29 home runs. Otherwise, 
Finley got a lot of mileage out of players such as Sal Bando, Bert Campaneris, 
Gene Tenace, Dick Green and catcher Ray Fosse. 
</P>
<P>
The managers, who ran Finley's errands, were Dick Williams in 1972-73 and Alvin 
Dark in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
1951 YANKEES 
</P>
<P>
"In Casey Stengel's first five years as manager, the Yankees won five pennants 
and five straight World Series in 1949, '50, '51, '52 and '53. No one has ever 
done that before or since. 
</P>
<P>
"Then Casey came back in 1955, '56, '57, and '58 and won four more pennants -- 
that's nine in 10 years -- plus two more World Series in '56 and '58. Finally, 
after winning his 10th pennant, he lost the seventh game of the 1960 World 
Series when Bill Mazeroski hit that home run for Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"Casey, I feel, has been under-appreciated as a baseball man. He wasn't just 
the most colorful baseball character of the last 50 years, he lived the game 24 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"This was appropriately recognized at his funeral service. I'll never forget 
that instead of 'Nearer My God to Thee,' they played 'Take Me Out to the 
Ballgame' all the way through Casey's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came out of the chapel, it had been raining a bit, and there was a 
rainbow in the sky -- a colorful rainbow in L.A., mind you. One of the other 
pall bearers saw it at the same time I did and whispered, 'I see Casey's at it 
already.' " 
</P>
<P>
Of Stengel's seven world champions, Patterson's favorite was the 1951 team -- 
DiMaggio's last in the majors and Mickey Mantle's first. And in retrospect, 
Stengel's managing or his jesting, whatever, was at least as helpful as the 
contributions of his batsmen. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't a .300 hitter in an outfield in which DiMaggio and Mantle both 
finished in the .260s. In fact, on a team with Yogi Berra catching and 
infielders such as Bobby Brown, Phil Rizzuto, and Johnny Mize, the only .300 
hitter was a rookie infielder, Gil McDougald. 
</P>
<P>
The club was carried by pitchers Ed Lopat (21-9), Vic Raschi (21-10), and the 
Superchief from Oklahoma, Allie Reynolds (17-8), who pitched two no-hitters 
that season -- inducing Ted Williams to loft a foul ball to Yogi Berra for the 
last out in the second one after Berra, on a three and two count, dropped 
Williams' first high foul. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1951 World Series, camaraderie or team spirit -- or Stengel -- may have 
been decisive, along with the pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"The Giants won the first game after beating the Dodgers in the playoff on 
Bobby Thomson's home run. The Yankees won the second, and the third was 
supposed to be pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the day when Eddie Stanky kicked the ball out of Phil Rizzuto's 
glove, and the Giants went on to win, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"On the fourth day it rained, and the papers were full of Stanky's dropkick. 
The Yankees read and heard everything they could stand about that kick." 
</P>
<P>
When they came out for the fourth game, they came out in one group, like a 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, baseball players straggle out two or three at a time -- but not those 
Yankees. Not for that fourth game at the Polo Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all together when they came down the narrow stairway from the 
clubhouse way out (in center field), and together they walked all that long way 
in. That's the only time I ever saw that. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the writers and, I'm sure, some Giant fans looked at each other and 
said, 'It's all over.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was. In the last three games, the Yankees won three straight." 
</P>
<P>
The winning pitchers: Reynolds, Lopat and Raschi. 
</P>
<P>
1922 GIANTS 
</P>
<P>
"Casey Stengel was a player in 1922, and a pretty good one, on one of (Manager) 
John McGraw's best teams when the New York Giants swept the Yankees in the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"The Giants had won the Series the year before, and they (were to) win it again 
in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
"McGraw won four straight 1920s pennants but lost the 1924 World Series to the 
boy manager, Bucky Harris, when Walter Johnson pitched all 12 innings for the 
Washington Senators in the seventh game." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 1922 Giants had come over in trades from Cincinnati, Philadelphia, 
Boston or other National League teams, either that year or a few years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Stengel, a left-handed outfielder who came from Philadelphia in 1921, led the 
1922 Giants with a career-high .368 batting average, though he only played in 
84 games. 
</P>
<P>
That was a season when every Giant starter hit .322 or better except third 
baseman Heine Groh, who trailed at .265. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Frank Snyder and third baseman Dave (Beauty) Bancroft joined Stengel 
with lifetime bests. The other infielders, Hall of Famer Frankie Frisch, the 
Fordham Flash, and George (Highpockets) Kelly, weren't far behind. Nor were the 
other outfielders, Irish Meusel, Bob's brother, and Ross Youngs. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching was hardly world class although Rosy Ryan (17-12) led the league 
with a 3.01 ERA. Steadier in the first World Series ever broadcast, Giant 
pitchers held Babe Ruth to a composite .118. 
</P>
<P>
THE NEXT FIVE 
</P>
<P>
1929 PHILADELPHIA A'S: Owner-Manager Connie Mack's best team, with five Hall of 
Famers including catcher Mickey Cochrane in his prime, won the World Series in 
1929 and 1930 from the Cubs and Cardinals, respectively, before losing to the 
Cardinals in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
On Mack's great 1929 club, which beat the Cubs in five games, left fielder Al 
Simmons hit .365 and led the league with 157 runs batted in. The other three 
Hall of Famers were pitcher Lefty Grove (20-6), and infielders Jimmie Foxx and 
Eddie Collins. 
</P>
<P>
1955 DODGERS: After losing five World Series to the Yankees in '41, '47, '49, 
'52, and '53, the Dodgers, then in Brooklyn, lost the first two games of the 
'55 Series. But they fought on, and, in Brooklyn's biggest day, finally won a 
seventh game from the Yankees as Johnny Podres pitched a 2-0 shutout. Jackie 
Robinson was at second base after playing three other positions as a regular in 
three previous World Series: first base, third and left field. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Roy Campanella became a three-time National League MVP as Gil Hodges, 
Duke Snider, Pee Wee Reese and rookie pitcher Roger Craig, a Series winner, 
also helped make that team memorable. 
</P>
<P>
1963 DODGERS: Manager Walt Alston led the Dodgers to seven pennants in '55, 
'56, '59, '63, '65, '66 and '74 and to four World Series victories in '55, '59, 
'63 and '65. The '63 champions, who swept the Yankees in four games, were 
builder Walter O'Malley's favorite team. The catcher was Johnny Roseboro. The 
inspiration came from shortstop Maury Wills. 
</P>
<P>
Don Drysdale pitched a 1-0 shutout in the '63 'Series, in which the Dodgers 
yielded but four runs in four games. Podres was a 4-1 winner. After Sandy 
Koufax won the first and fourth games, he was named MVP. "Why me?" he asked. "I 
gave up three of the four runs." 
</P>
<P>
1907 CHICAGO CUBS: Baseball's first great team, with Manager Frank Chance, the 
Peerless Leader, at first base, won consecutive pennants and two World Series 
in 1906-07-08. Pitcher Mordecai Peter Centennial (Three Finger) Brown was 26-6, 
20-6 and 29-9 in those three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
On the 1907 team, a four-straight World Series winner, the answer to baseball's 
most enduring trivia question was Harry Steinfeldt. The question: Who played 
third base on the team that immortalized the double play with (Joe) Tinker to 
(Johnny) Evers to Chance? 
</P>
<P>
1916 BOSTON RED SOX: To win their second straight World Series, the Red Sox, 
managed by Bill Carrigan, needed a strong pitching performance in the second 
game -- which went 14 innings, still the Series record. Happily, they had a 
left-hander on their staff who could do it. 
</P>
<P>
He was Babe Ruth, who pitched all 14 innings. Ruth hit .272 in 1916, with three 
home runs. As a pitcher he was 23-12, the year before his career-high 24-13.

ROSE CASE SITE DEBATED; 
</P>
<P>
NO REASON TO SWITCH, HIS LAWYERS ARGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Seeking the home court advantage, attorneys for Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete 
Rose asked a federal judge in Columbus, Ohio, Monday to return Rose's suit 
against baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti to a state court because 
allegations of local bias were not grounds for a move to the federal system. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief filed in the U.S. District Court of Judge John Holschuh, the 
attorneys argued that baseball's "irrelevant ramblings about some supposed 
federal interest" did not provide a basis for moving the case to federal court 
and accused baseball of making "thinly veiled attacks on Ohio's state courts." 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication when Holschuh will rule as to whether the state or 
federal system has jurisdiction over Rose's attempt to seek a preliminary 
injunction preventing Giamatti from conducting a hearing that could result in 
Rose's suspension from baseball if it is determined he bet on the Reds, as 
alleged by baseball's special investigator, John Dowd, in his report to 
Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
That hearing was originally scheduled June 26, but on June 25 Rose received a 
temporary restraining order against Giamatti from Judge Norbert A. Nadel of the 
Hamilton County Common Pleas Court in Cincinnati. Nadel supported Rose's 
contention that Giamatti has prejudged the case against Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Nadel was scheduled to hear Rose's bid for a preliminary injunction July 6, but 
on July 3 the U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, responding to a motion by 
Giamatti's attorneys to move the case to federal court, assigned the motion to 
Holschuh's court in Columbus and wrote that because of Rose's national 
reputation and identification with the Reds and Cincinnati, it appeared 
advisable to transfer the request to another city. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, in turn, filed a motion with Holschuh asking that the case be returned to 
the state court, prompting Holschuh to set a July 12 deadline for receiving 
baseball's arguments on the subject and July 17 for receiving Rose's. At the 
same time, he extended Rose's protection against suspension and firing, as 
enacted by Nadel, until he makes a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti, according to his staff, wants the case in federal court for two basic 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The federal courts have always upheld the commissioner's authority. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A state judge in Rose's hometown of Cincinnati, facing reelection as Nadel 
is, could be influenced to make a parochial decision. Federal judges are 
appointed. 
</P>
<P>
"If ever it were appropriate to remove a case to the federal court to avoid 
such local pressures, this is the case," attorneys for Giamatti wrote in a 
110-page brief filed with Holschuh last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
They also wrote that the federal court has jurisdiction on the grounds of 
diversity of citizenship, Rose being a resident of Ohio and Giamatti of New 
York. However, Rose's suit also names the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
"Under governing law, all doubts must be resolved in remanding this case to 
state court," Rose's attorneys said in the brief filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, according to legal experts, that Holschuh will schedule a 
hearing with the two sides before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
The losing side is expected to appeal, further delaying a process that began in 
late March with the announcement that Rose was being investigated for alleged 
gambling activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are sick of this. I know I am," Red owner Marge Schott told the 
Associated Press Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Schott was recently hospitalized for tests relating to an undisclosed ailment 
that stemmed, she said, from job-related stress. In addition to the allegations 
and legal problems surrounding Rose, the Reds have been decimated by injuries 
and lost 23 of their last 33 games. 
</P>
<P>
"These are tough times," she said. "It's been a very difficult thing for me, 
you know." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ron Peters, identified by federal authorities and investigator Dowd 
as the bookmaker who handled Rose's bets, entered a federal prison camp in 
Terre Haute, Ind., Monday to begin a two-year sentence on federal charges of 
cocaine distribution and making false statements on his 1985 income tax. Peters 
could have received a 23-year sentence, but federal authorities requested a 
reduced term because Peters had cooperated with a federal grand jury 
investigation of Rose's taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing your face in the paper every day and on the news -- I'm sure it's going 
to be awhile before my face gets in the paper again -- just to get away from 
all that for a while will be nice," Peters said as he prepared to enter the 
prison camp.

Hart Lee Dykes, a first-round National Football League draft choice of the New 
England Patriots, has agreed to terms for a 1990 minor league contract with the 
Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Dykes, a left-handed pitcher, has been working out in Sarasota, Fla., with the 
White Sox rookie team. Dykes was the Chicago's 54th selection in the June 
amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4, 220-pound Dykes, who played at Oklahoma State, was the first wide 
receiver taken in April's NFL draft and was the 16th player selected overall. 
</P>
<P>
White Sox General Manager Larry Himes said Dykes "signed a contract for a 
Class-A salary. There was no bonus money involved." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Dykes might be using baseball as leverage in negotiations with the 
Patriots, Himes said: "I don't know. This was his personal choice. Maybe he 
wants to play both baseball and football." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Sullivan, New England general manager, said in a prepared statement: 
"When we drafted Hart Lee, we knew he was an exceptional athlete who had pro 
baseball potential. In our conversation with his agent (Monday), however, he 
left no doubt that football is Hart's first choice."

Linebacker Hugh Green of the Miami Dolphins missed the first day of training 
camp after he was arrested and charged with spouse battery. 
</P>
<P>
Green was released on $10,000 bond Sunday morning, about 12 hours after his 
wife Monica, 22, was struck in the head and chest at the couple's home, 
Hillsborough (Fla.) sheriff's spokesman Jack Espinosa said. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged incident took place during a birthday party for Green. The Greens 
became involved in an argument and the linebacker admitted hitting his wife, a 
sheriff's office report said.

INJURED INDIANAPOLIS GIRL GETS EARLY BIRTHDAY PRESENT

The Indianapolis girl who lost her left hand when a bomb exploded at a K mart 
store is learning to make necklaces and hair bows with an artificial hand, her 
mother says. 
</P>
<P>
The high-tech prosthetic hand came as an early birthday present for Erin Bower, 
who turns 6 today. 
</P>
<P>
Erin received the electrically-powered hand at Medical Center Prosthetics in 
Houston last week and is participating in a three-week training program to help 
her use it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think she'll ever forget this birthday. It's because of her hand. She 
loves her hand," Erin's mother, Maureen, said in a telephone interview with the 
Indianapolis Star. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Bower planned a birthday celebration for Erin, who was injured April 17 
when a bomb went off as she picked up a package of toothpaste at the K mart 
store in Castleton. The case remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Bower said that when Erin put on her electrically-powered hand for the 
first time, she said, "Mommy, I wish I could have my other hand back." 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Erin, I do, too,' " Bower recalled. "She said, 'It's too bad we just 
can't grow one.' I told her, 'I wish we could, but we can't.' Then Erin said, 
'Well, this arm isn't bad, I like this arm, too.' 
</P>
<P>
Erin undergoes two hours of therapy a day to learn how to use the hand, which 
is activated by nerve impulses in Erin's left arm. The electrical current 
released by those muscles is picked up by electrodes in the artificial hand, 
causing it to move as Erin desires. 
</P>
<P>
Bower said the therapy has been fun for her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"They know she loves arts-and-crafty kind of things. She's made bead necklaces. 
She's made hair bows, so she'll learn to tie. She's played cards. They have a 
bow and arrow with a plunger at the end, and she's learned to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Bower has been told it will be at least six months before Erin starts 
using her artificial hand with the same confidence and reflexes as the old one. 
</P>
<P>
She said the training program has also helped her daughter psychologically 
because she sees other children who have lost limbs. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps Erin to put her own problems in perspective. And me, too," Maureen 
Bower said. "What happened to Erin, we're kind of lucky she's even here with 
us."

AFTER 1,050 RELIEF APPEARANCES, TEKULVE ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT

<P>
Kent Tekulve, who relieved in more games than any other pitcher in major league 
history, announced his retirement Monday, effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Tekulve, 42, said he had trouble accepting his diminished role as a middle 
reliever with the Cincinnati Reds. His pitching recently also had suffered -- 
he was 0-3 with one save and a 5.02 earned-run average in 37 relief appearances 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds signed Tekulve as a free agent over the winter, expecting to make him 
a set-up man along with Rob Dibble for bullpen ace John Franco. Dibble has 
gotten the majority of the work, leaving Tekulve to pitch middle relief. 
</P>
<P>
"My role on this club went down some from what we expected at the start of the 
season," Tekulve said, in a statement released by the team. "After all those 
years of being in the middle of things, I wasn't enjoying being on the fringe." 
</P>
<P>
The submarine-style pitcher played a major role as the bullpen ace on the 
Pittsburgh Pirates' 1979 championship team, saving three games in the World 
Series against the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Tekulve came up in the Pirate organization and was promoted to the majors 
during the 1974 season. He was traded to Philadelphia in 1985, and was released 
by the Phillies after last season. The Reds signed Tekulve before this season. 
</P>
<P>
The right-hander finished with a 94-90 career record with 184 saves and 1,050 
relief appearances. He surpassed Hoyt Wilhelm's previous record of 1,018 career 
relief appearances on April 17, and was nearing Wilhelm's record of 1,070 total 
appearances by a pitcher.

MITCHELL KOS KELLY AT FORUM

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russell Mitchell won the North American Boxing Federation welterweight 
championship Monday by knocking out former champion Derrick Kelly of Riverside 
in the seventh round of their scheduled 12-round bout at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, of Quail Valley, Calif., was rated No. 10 by the NABF. He was 
outpointed in the first five rounds as Kelly took command. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell responded with a short right cross that struck Kelly on the temple and 
at 2:52 of the seventh round, referee Chuck Hassett counted Kelly out. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly is 24-2-2 with nine knockouts and Mitchell is 16-10-3, also with nine 
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier bout, Kenny Baysmore of Washington knocked out Benny Lopez of 
Upland in the first round of their scheduled 10-round quarterfinal Forum super 
featherweight tournament match. 
</P>
<P>
Baysmore knocked Lopez down with a right, and referee Lou Moret ended the bout 
at 2:59 of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Baysmore is 25-2-1, with 21 knockouts, and Lopez is 13-6, with nine knockouts.

A COUPLE OF OLD FRIENDS SLUG IT OUT

One doesn't have to pay half the rent money for a great seat to a good boxing 
match. Keep an ear to the ground, and you can find out where to see one from 
ringside -- at no cost. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, word was out of an afternoon meeting in East Los Angeles. Al 
Stanky, Paul Gonzales' trainer, was on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"Come to the Resurrection Gym on Lorena Street, about 2:30," Stanky said. 
"Paul's going to spar with Ricky Romero for five or six rounds; they've been 
really going after each other." 
</P>
<P>
Resurrection Gym was once known as the Church of the Resurrection and, from the 
outside, it still looks like a church. There's no gym sign, but even from 
across the street, parking in front of La Pasadita Tortilleria, you know you're 
at the right place when you hear the unmistakable rattle of punching bags and 
the tap-tap-tap of jump ropes slapping against a wooden floor. 
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone outside reads 1924, but no one seems to know when the church 
was converted to a gym. 
</P>
<P>
In a gym such as this, a dream was brought to life for Paul Gonzales, one-time 
gang member from the Aliso Village projects. A cop, Stanky, turned him from a 
street fighter into a boxer and darned if the kid didn't win a gold medal at 
the Olympics, just like he said he would. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Gonzales and Romero were Los Angeles-area light-flyweights. Both made 
a U.S. team that toured three cities in the Soviet Union in early 1984, but 
only Gonzales made the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales and Romero figure they have sparred about 200 rounds over the last 
decade. Now they were meeting again. 
</P>
<P>
Red Shannon, a big-name Los Angeles featherweight in the 1930s, is cinching 
Romero's headgear. Romero, 17-1 as a professional super-flyweight, has a 
Saturday meeting with Jose Quirino at the Antelope Valley Fairgrounds for the 
California super-flyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
It's hot and stuffy in the little gym, but Gonzales steps into the ring wearing 
a blue sweat suit. A bantamweight now, Gonzales has to drop from 122 pounds to 
118 for a July 31 bout in Sacramento with an opponent to be named. Gonzales has 
had two opponents scheduled for that date, but both have fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
In the emotional aftermath of the 1984 Olympics, Gonzales predicted he'd win 
six world pro championships. And after he had courageously fought his way 
through the two-week tournament with a broken right hand, who was going to 
challenge him? 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, Gonzales is still looking for that first title shot, but now 
he talks as much about going to law school as he does about winning pro titles. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed in '84 it would take this long," he said. "I took a year off 
for my hand to heal; my car rolled over my left foot and broke it; I had knee 
surgery; I hurt my hand again, and I injured my hip falling off a bike. In a 
way, it's amazing I've had 13 fights." 
</P>
<P>
He is 12-1 and might be, finally, a fight away from a title shot. 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Don Chargin finds Gonzales much more attractive championship material 
as a bantamweight. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Paul's been at fly too long," he said. "The knock on him at fly was 
he'd never scored a single knockdown in 10 fights. But at bantam, in his last 
two fights, he's scored clean knockouts. Really, I like him a lot better now; 
he can really hit with those few extra pounds. I told Paul and Al that I want 
to see him once more at this weight, against a good fighter, and if he looks 
good again I'd get them a title fight." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales and Stanky, however, are reluctant to leave the super-flyweight 
division because both think Mexican Gilberto Roman, the World Boxing Council 
champion, is beatable. 
</P>
<P>
The game plan: Beat Roman at 115 pounds, then abandon the championship and move 
up to bantamweight in search of Orlando Canizales. In 1986, Gonzales won a 
decision over Canizales, who has since become the International Boxing 
Federation bantamweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already beaten Canizales, and he's a champion," Gonzales said. "I want 
him again -- I know I can win that title." 
</P>
<P>
The horn sounded on the round clock and the two little boxers marched toward 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
Romero was always shorter and more muscled than Gonzales. Most who watched them 
as amateurs always figured Romero was more suited to the rough pro game. 
Gonzales started Romero off with a jolting left jab, but Romero countered 
immediately, deftly stepping inside with a left hook to the ribs. 
</P>
<P>
The fighters tore into each other furiously. There were crisp exchanges at 
center ring, in the corners and along the ropes. Shannon and Stanky shouted 
encouragement. The half-dozen other boxers in the gym stopped their workouts to 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
There was a rare intensity to it all, and both seemed exhausted at the end, 
after five rounds. When Shannon and Stanky pulled the headgear off, both 
fighters wore smiles, and they hugged each other. 
</P>
<P>
"This is perfect, for both these guys," Stanky said. "Both are roughly the same 
weight and both have important fights coming up. Ricky is going to walk through 
that guy (Quirino) because of this great work he's been getting with Paul. Same 
with Paul." 
</P>
<P>
Fight preparation days are long ones for Romero. He's a medical records clerk 
in Torrance. In the afternoons, he goes to war with Gonzales. He'll earn his 
biggest purse for Quirino, $2,500, and he can use it -- he and his wife, Suzie, 
have a new daughter, Nicole LeAnn. 
</P>
<P>
Romero praised his longtime pal. 
</P>
<P>
"When Paul and I sparred when we were both flyweights, he never really hurt 
me," he said. "But just those few more pounds make a lot of difference. When he 
hits you now, it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Shannon is 69 now, and has seen all kinds. Romero, he says, is the best kind. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great kid," he said, as Romero cooled down with a speed bag. 
"Absolutely perfect work habits. He's always on time. I've trained a lot of 
fighters in my day and some of them, if they didn't show up late, didn't show 
up at all." 
</P>
<P>
Would these two fighters ever meet for real? 
</P>
<P>
"Anything's possible, but I doubt it," Stanky said. "Paul's going up in weight 
from where he is now, and Ricky is staying at 115." 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of hard to think of fighting a friend, for real," Gonzales said. 
"But if we did, it would be all business with me. He'd feel the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Then the Stanky needle: "Let me put it this way, we'd never turn down a Romero 
fight, because that would be easy money for us, and you want that easy money 
anytime you can get it." 
</P>
<P>

Exchanges Discuss Merger: The Philadelphia and American stock exchanges are 
discussing either a full or partial merger, the New York Times reported in 
today's editions. Under the plans, which are in the preliminary stages, either 
the exchanges would be combined outright or they would merge their 
options-trading operations, the newspaper reported, quoting unidentified 
sources. The merger discussions are fueled by a recent rule adopted by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the trading of equity options, the 
sources said. Under the rule, which will be phased in over the next few years, 
multiple exchanges would be able to trade an equity option, unlike the current 
system in which each option is allotted exclusively to an exchange.

Hughes Gets Some Help: U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills has taken the 
unusual step of writing to the Brazilian government to support an American bid 
for a crucial $150-million communications satellite contract. U.S. Embassy 
officials in Brasilia confirmed that the letter had been sent at the request of 
Hughes Aircraft, the Los Angeles-based satellite maker and General Motors 
subsidiary. Hughes is locked in competition with a consortium led by Spar of 
Canada and Matra of France to build two satellites under the Brasilsat-2 
program.

U.S. IS LOSING BILLIONS ON FORECLOSED MORTGAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The taxpayers' bill for foreclosures on federally backed mortgages for 
middle-class housing has passed the $2-billion mark and is showing few signs of 
leveling off as once-profitable government housing insurance funds are hit with 
the full impact of the losses, according to government and housing industry 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Housing insurance programs run by the departments of Housing and Urban 
Development and Veterans Affairs have helped millions of Americans buy homes 
and build or rehabilitate multi-family housing during the last half century. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases these programs paid their own way from the fees they collected 
and had enough left over to contribute to the federal Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Those days are over for the biggest of the programs, which are now a drain on 
the Treasury. The economic slump in the South, Southwest and parts of the West 
is a major contributor, but mismanagement and fraud also have played a part. 
</P>
<P>
Housing program staffs, cut back sharply by the Reagan-era effort to contract 
programs out to private companies, were unable to monitor many programs 
adequately while the cost of favors for high-ranking Republicans compounded the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Government National Mortgage Assn., a mortgage-financing agency known as 
Ginnie Mae, is the latest to suffer. The agency's losses could eventually hit 
$1 billion, and Ginnie Mae is blaming much of its problem on the Department of 
Veterans Affairs' loan guaranty policies. Unless action is taken to curb the 
expected VA losses, Ginnie Mae could be recording losses of $50 million to $100 
million annually starting as early as next year, according to a high-ranking 
Ginnie Mae official who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Housing Administration, which provides government insurance on home 
buyers' loans, is also reporting losses after 55 years of profitability. The 
FHA lost $452 million in 1987 and continued to lose $40 million a month on its 
single-family home insurance program during the six months ended March 31, 
according to the Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The VA is being hit even harder. Congress has appropriated $1.7 billion since 
1984 to keep the department's loan fund afloat and will have to continue 
covering losses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Ginnie Mae plays a pivotal role in the U.S. real estate market by raising money 
for loans to home buyers and developers of rental apartments. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of Ginnie Mae, lenders bundle together FHA- and VA-insured 
mortgages and issue bonds backed, or "secured," by the mortgages and the 
monthly payments they are supposed to produce. Paying the investors each month 
is the responsibility of the lenders. When a homeowner defaults, the VA and FHA 
are responsible for insuring the mortgage principal. But Ginnie Mae must keep 
up with the monthly interest payments, at least until the property is sold.

Inventories Rise: Business inventories rose 0.7% in May as sales growth 
stagnated, the Commerce Department said, leading some analysts to predict 
further production cutbacks during the rest of the year. When not accompanied 
by increases in sales, rising inventories often prompt manufacturers to 
decrease production until stockpiled goods are sold, resulting in a loss of 
jobs. The department said inventories held on shelves and back lots climbed to 
a seasonally adjusted $776.9 billion in May after a 0.8% rise in April. The 
pace of business sales, on the other hand, rose a minuscule 0.02% to a 
seasonally adjusted $517.9 billion. Sales had risen 2% in April after holding 
steady in March.

"The implication is that production is going to slow some more in the second 
half of the year," said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch Capital 
Markets in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It could imply a small inventory correction in the second half," said James 
Annable, an economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The May business activity produced a slight increase in the ratio of 
inventories to sales. It was 1.5, meaning it would take 1 1/2 months to exhaust 
inventories at the May sales pace. The ratio was 1.49 in April and 1.51 in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the buildup was most felt in the retail area, where the 
economy has slowed the most as the Federal Reserve tightened credit to contain 
inflation. Inventories were up 0.9%, compared to a sales decrease of 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm starting to wonder whether retailer inventories are getting out of hand," 
said Michael Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank in New York. "The numbers 
suggest they're growing a little too fast." 
</P>
<P>
The automobile industry, which has seen new car inventories swell, already has 
reduced production at some factories. The Commerce Department said auto 
inventories rose 0.9% in May while sales dropped 1.8% from April. 
</P>
<P>
But even without the automobile category, inventories rose 0.9% in May. 
</P>
<P>
Other major inventory increases were noted at department and clothing stores, 
Steinberg said. Overall, general merchandise inventories rose 2.2%. 
</P>
<P>
All categories showed increased inventories in May, however. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 0.9% increase in the retail area, manufacturers' backlogs 
were up 0.6% while wholesalers' buildup was 0.8%. Inventories were 8.1% above 
the level in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesalers registered the only sales increase in May, up 0.5%. Manufacturers' 
sales fell 0.2% and retailers' were down 0.1%. Sales rose 8.2% over May of last 
year.

WAL-MART CONFIRMS ENTRANCE INTO CALIFORNIA MARKET IN 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the highly successful discount chain based in Arkansas, 
confirmed Monday that it plans to enter the California market in 1990, with 
stores in Madera, Stockton and Elk Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The first opening is scheduled for next summer in Stockton, where Wal-Mart will 
build a 110,580-square-foot store that the company said will create about 245 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento office of Riley/Pearlman, a commercial real estate firm based in 
Los Angeles, will develop the shopping center that will house the Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
Openings of stores in new centers in Madera and Elk Grove are planned for fall, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., now operates 1,307 discount stores in 25 
states. It also runs 108 Sam's Wholesale Clubs, three Hypermart USA stores, 14 
Dot Discount Drug Stores and 16 distribution centers. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported sales of $20.6 billion for the year ended Jan. 31, making 
it the nation's third-largest retailer after Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and K 
mart. A fast-growing company, Wal-Mart plans to open 155 stores in 1989 and 
expects to surpass $25 billion in sales this year.

VONS ROLLS OUT ALTERNATIVE TO FAST FOOD FOR BUSY SHOPPERS

Vons Cos., which rolls out new store concepts at a dizzying pace, has 
introduced a Deli Express where customers can buy breakfast, lunch or dinner to 
take out or eat at a counter in the store. 
</P>
<P>
With the format, unveiled last week as a "walk-around island" in the company's 
supermarket near the traffic circle in Long Beach, Vons hopes to go after the 
business of McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Winchell's Donut House, El 
Pollo Loco, Wendy's, 7-Eleven and other places geared to on-the-go customers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to such standard fare as hamburgers, sandwiches, nachos and pizza 
slices, the in-store shop is selling bagels, breakfast rolls, fresh fruit 
trays, salads, baked potatoes, kung pao chicken and chicken pot pies. 
</P>
<P>
The new format grew out of the Express convenience store-within-a-store that 
Vons started last summer and now has in two stores. The idea was to combine in 
one spot several services normally found scattered throughout many upscale 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
"We want (Deli Express) to be a destination," said Phil Hawkins, vice president 
of merchandising, who came up with both ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Early results are encouraging, a Vons spokeswoman said. Over the weekend, Deli 
Express couldn't keep some fast-selling items in stock. MARTHA GROVES

Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. salvaged a deal Monday that had fallen through 
last week by agreeing to acquire the branch offices and customer accounts of 
brokerage firm Thomson McKinnon Inc. for about $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential-Bache, subsidiary of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, announced 
Friday that it was terminating its agreement to buy all of Thomson McKinnon 
because of balance sheet problems. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement announced Monday, Prudential-Bache would acquire Thomson 
McKinnon's 154 branch offices, 2,000 brokers and customer accounts. 
</P>
<P>
By adding the retail network to Prudential-Bache's 6,000 brokers and 302 
offices worldwide, the company would become Wall Street's fourth-largest firm, 
behind Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Dean Witter 
Reynolds Inc.

A Prudential-Bache spokeswoman said "there may well be some branches that will 
be closed" after the merger is completed, and she noted that there would likely 
be some attrition among former Thomson brokers. Prudential-Bache, however, will 
spend an additional $60 million over three years for incentives to encourage 
the brokers to stay. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Prudential-Bache said it would acquire about 5% of Thomson 
McKinnon Asset Management, a limited partnership that manages the brokerage's 
money and investment management business. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential-Bache and Thomson McKinnon announced their intention to merge June 
13. But the agreement was canceled after Thomson McKinnon liabilities were 
revealed in a "due diligence review."

Wall Street's blue chip stocks ended a nine-session winning streak Monday as 
the market's key Dow index strayed slightly lower in an uncertain session. 
</P>
<P>
The market's transportation issues extended their rally, however, as takeover 
speculation drove airline stocks higher. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index finished down 1.33 points at 2,553.49, breaking 
the longest run of advancing sessions since January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous two weeks, the Dow had chalked up gains of more than 110 
points, setting three post-crash closing highs by the end of last week, on 
expectations of falling interest rates and takeover rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues just slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 757 up, 713 down and 516 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 131.96 million shares, down from 
183.48 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the new week began with an added element of caution, however, over 
the impending monthly report today on the nation's international balance of 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
The data for May is expected to show an increase in the trade deficit to $9 
billion or more from $8.3 billion in April. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policy Response 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Wall Street is expecting the Labor Department to report a June 
increase for the consumer price index of about 0.3%, down from 0.6% in May. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal &amp; Co., noted 
that the market was somewhat disappointed by the Federal Reserve's failure to 
decisively lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow transportation average closed up 18.76 points at 1,229.30, led by a 
surge in UAL Corp.'s stock, which added 8 to 174 3/4 on a fresh bout of 
takeover speculation. Many traders believe that a raider is accumulating stock 
in UAL and will surface soon. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Laboratories led the NYSE active list and jumped 8 1/4 to 33 1/2 on 
turnover of more than 5.8 million shares. Dow Chemical plans to acquire a chunk 
of Marion stock for $38 a share, increasing its stake in the company to 67%. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Chemical shares dropped 1 1/2 to 88 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
B. F. Goodrich, subject of speculation about a possible takeover bid, climbed 3 
1/4 to 61 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines was a standout among the blue chips, adding 1 
1/4 to 116. But General Motors dropped 1/2 to 43; McDonald's lost 1/2 to 29 
5/8, and General Electric was unchanged at 54 5/8, registering little response 
to the company's announcement of higher second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Schwab Corp., which posted increased profits for the second quarter, 
gained 3/8 to 13, trading at new highs since the 1987 crash. 
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices slumped in the year's lightest 
trading ahead of elections set for the start of next week. The 225-share Nikkei 
index eased 118.55 points to close at 33,456.22 after slipping 56.39 points 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices ended slightly higher on the London Stock Exchange, despite a 
round of profit taking in the afternoon. The Financial Times 100-share index 
ended up 1.2 points at 2,274.9. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates jumped as speculators lost confidence that the Federal Reserve 
would loosen credit in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
The weakness started in short-term securities, which are most sensitive to 
Federal Reserve policies, and then spread to the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue sagged 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 
face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, 
rose to 8.12% from 8.08% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve drained reserves from the banking system on Friday and 
again Monday, an indication to traders that it was not about to push rates 
lower to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank still may liberalize credit, but is not likely to do so before 
Thursday's congressional testimony by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, said Steven 
R. Ricchiuto, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government Securities Inc. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.25%, up from 9.188% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures prices plummeted on the Chicago Board of Trade as a 
forecast for cooler, wetter weather over the next 10 days eased traders' fears 
of supply tightness. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, coffee was sharply lower on news that Colombia is ending 
nearly all taxes on its exports to become more competitive in the newly 
deregulated marketplace; heating oil led a modest rally in the petroleum 
futures complex, and cattle futures climbed in anticipation of a government 
report that is expected to show fewer animals on the feedlots.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Monday decided to allow two 
futures-type financial instruments to be traded outside organized exchanges, 
dealing a setback for the futures industry based in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In a ruling sought by many banks and businesses, the agency that regulates the 
nation's futures exchanges voted to exclude the burgeoning, billion-dollar swap 
markets from its control. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a defeat for the exchanges, the commission cleared the way for firms to 
issue directly to the public some over-the-counter instruments that resemble 
options. 
</P>
<P>
The commission approved a statement saying swap transactions will not be 
regulated as futures or commodity options.

FRENCH, SWISS FIRMS SAY THEY MAY JOIN IN GOLDSMITH'S BID FOR BAT

<P>
French financial group Compagnie Financiere de Paribas said Monday that it 
might join Sir James Goldsmith in his proposed $21.2-billion buyout of BAT 
Industries PLC. 
</P>
<P>
"We are considering taking part in the bid. Very advanced discussions are under 
way with (Goldsmith's) Hoylake Investment Ltd.," a Paribas spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Swiss investment group Pargesa Holding SA also said it might back the 
consortium seeking control of BAT, which has substantial holdings in tobacco, 
retailing and insurance on both sides of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest takeover battle in European corporate history has been topped only 
by the $25-billion RJR Nabisco Inc. buyout in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Paribas would broaden financial support for the bid, which has 
hit some skepticism in London's relatively staid stock market, where 
billion-dollar deals were unusual until recently. 
</P>
<P>
Anglo-French financier Goldsmith, together with British banker Jacob Rothschild 
and Australian businessman Kerry Packer, launched his bid last Tuesday, sending 
the London market soaring. 
</P>
<P>
But there has been concern over the group's plan to fund the cashless bid with 
junk bonds. Financial analysts have said British regulatory authorities might 
feel it necessary to launch an investigation into the offer because no cash is 
involved.

HOW A PAPER'S EXPLICIT RAPE POLICY AFFECTS A TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SHELTON, Wash.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a rookie reporter in the 1950s, Al Ford learned it was his job to name 
everyone who stood up to testify at a criminal trial. That included rape 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the late '60s, feminists argued that rape is a particularly personal 
crime that ought to be treated with special sensitivity by the press. Virtually 
all newspapers reversed their former policy and began to withhold the names of 
women who had been raped. 
</P>
<P>
But the gusts of social change seemed to bypass Ford, who still identifies 
sexual assault victims. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been yelled at, threatened, accused of having no compassion," said Ford, 
a short, dapper grandfather of seven whose unconventional reporting policy sets 
the standard at the Shelton-Mason County Journal (circulation, 8,782). The 
Journal is one of not more than 10 newspapers in the country, and perhaps the 
only one in the West, which make a point of naming rape victims. 
</P>
<P>
More proponents of the policy are coming forth in the wake of a June 21 Supreme 
Court ruling concerning a Florida newspaper that inadvertently revealed a rape 
victim's name. The court held that the small, weekly paper in Jacksonville 
could not be punished for publishing the victim's name because the information 
was lawfully obtained. While the court did not declare unconstitutional Florida 
and South Carolina statutes prohibiting publication of rape victims' names, the 
ruling did say that, for now, it is up to journalists to decide the 
to-name-or-not-to-name question. 
</P>
<P>
An article in the June issue of FineLine, a newsletter on journalism ethics, 
was weighted in favor of naming victims. Six of eight news executives 
interviewed came down firmly on the side of identifying victims. 
</P>
<P>
And in a recent New York Times opinion piece, Geneva Overholser, editor of the 
Des Moines Register, said, even though her newspaper does not identify sexual 
assault victims, she believes in the concept of naming victims because "Rape is 
an American shame. Our society needs to see that and attend to it, not hide it 
or hush it up." 
</P>
<P>
Identifying rape victims will help lift the stigma surrounding sexual assault, 
proponents say. To impose anonymity on rape victims "singles out rape as 
something different and distinct and more awful" than other crimes whose 
victims are routinely named in the media, said Gilbert Geis, a UC Irvine 
professor emeritus who has studied the reporting of rape. "And maybe it is 
worse. But crimes like having your child kidnaped are pretty awful, too." 
</P>
<P>
Those who defend rape victims' right to privacy say making the crime public 
compounds the suffering of a victimized woman or a man. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main issues survivors have is taking back their power," said Jennie 
Balise of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. "And here you 
have an editor making a decision about an intimate event in a woman's life. 
He's yet another outside authority figure who's going to make a decision for 
her." 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old high school student who was identified as a rape victim by the 
Shelton paper felt that was the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I was raped once and then again," she said at a televised town meeting. "I was 
raped by the Mason County Journal." 
</P>
<P>
Shelton, a rainy lumber industry town at the base of the Olympic Peninsula, 
offers an example of what happens when a newspaper publishes the names of rape 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
A town of its size (population 7,500) normally has a rape trial only once every 
few years. There were two reported in 1988, five in 1987 -- about average for a 
town of its size. But when there is a trial, almost everyone knows about it 
because the Shelton Journal routinely gives front-page coverage to the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Along with naming the victim, whether she or he is a child or an adult, the 
paper provides an extensive, explicit synopsis of testimony. In the case of a 
16-year-old high school student, the Journal printed: "She (the victim) said he 
(the defendant) told her he would not hurt her if she just let him do it. She 
said he grabbed the bottom of her jeans and tried to pull them off while she 
tried to hold them up." 
</P>
<P>
Because Shelton is so small, readers are likely to know both the victim and the 
perpetrator, said Shannon Duffey, director of Recovery, a Shelton program that 
assists victims of sexual and domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Triggers Debate 
</P>
<P>
If the rapist doesn't fit the community's perception of a criminal, some people 
refuse to believe the victim, Duffey said. Often there's a public debate about 
whether the victim was raped. 
</P>
<P>
And the victims suffer even more personal traumas. 
</P>
<P>
Former friends shun them. Anonymous callers harass them at night. Strangers 
suddenly ask them on dates. 
</P>
<P>
"People think the victims are now more sexual," Duffey said. "People come on to 
them more, treat them more as someone who wanted it versus someone who was 
assaulted." 
</P>
<P>
One victim said she was so upset by the thought of her neighbors reading about 
the rape in the newspaper that she had to leave her own trial when the paper 
came out. After publication, the woman said her 8-year-old daughter's friends 
told her about the rape at school. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager mentioned earlier left school and got a tutor rather than face a 
classroom full of peers who knew about the assault. She once told a television 
reporter: "I didn't want to see anybody, talk to anybody. . . . I felt like 
everybody was out there looking at me, watching me." (This victim no longer 
wants to talk about her experience. Some of the other victims named in the 
newspaper in recent years also wish to remain anonymous.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Leave Town 
</P>
<P>
Rather than endure the stares and suspicion of their neighbors, many victims 
named in the Shelton paper move out of town. "It gets very difficult to live in 
this community" after your name has been published, said Pride Mutoli, a board 
member of the Mason County Council on Child Abuse and Neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Families of rape victims complain that they, too, suffer. "I just didn't like 
everyone talking about it -- it put me in a hard spot," the brother of one rape 
victim said. "Once in awhile, I heard people say, 'This guy (the accused) is a 
nice guy; he couldn't have done anything like that. The girl is just upset.' " 
</P>
<P>
The situation contributes to a feeling that nothing is confidential in Shelton, 
Mutoli said: "There's a climate of distrust in town. Everyone worries about who 
they talk to. There's a great deal of ill feeling and a lot of it is directed 
at the family who runs the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, local residents have picketed, petitioned and begged that the 
paper reconsider the policy. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Gay, 62, is the publisher of the Shelton-Mason Co. Journal. His son 
Charles Gay -- townspeople call him Charlie -- is the managing editor. The 
family bought the 103-year-old newspaper in 1965. Reporter Al Ford was already 
working there at the time. The three men found their views on reporting sex 
crimes were compatible. It was unfair, they thought, to report one party of a 
trial and not the other so they agreed to name any victim who testified as a 
witness in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The publisher said this policy is the only way to ensure that the accused is 
granted the "presumption of innocence." 
</P>
<P>
"Not one of our critics seems concerned about the defendant in a rape case," 
the elder Gay wrote in an editorial. "They assume he is guilty." 
</P>
<P>
A few committee members do support the policy. Rita McArthur, a retired Shelton 
schoolteacher, said she believes the policy will help end the stigma of rape. 
"For so long, rape victims have been made to feel as if they were the guilty 
party. I think this is a pioneering project in many ways," she said of the 
practice of naming rape victims. "It may bring a slow change but I think the 
change will come." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Rapes Reported 
</P>
<P>
But Henry Gay's policy has not resulted in a more enlightened response to rape 
in the community, but in fewer rapes reported and more rapists on the loose, 
say those who work with victims in Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of people out there who have been raped and whose children 
have been abused who will not report it because of the newspaper," said Mutoli 
of the child abuse council. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, when a sexual assault victim calls for help at any of the 
agencies in town, "one of their biggest concerns is that it's going to be in 
the paper," Duffey said. 'I have to tell them, 'Yes, it probably will be.' " 
</P>
<P>
Shelton Police Lt. Al Johnson agreed the threat of public exposure can affect a 
victim's willingness to report a crime. "Any time someone has to go public with 
that type of offense they have to do a lot of soul searching and sometimes they 
choose not to report." 
</P>
<P>
Mutoli added: 'We feel it actually encourages bad guys to live here. They feel 
safe because none of the victims want to hassle with the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
But Henry Gay said it's unfair to single out his paper's policy as the reason 
women in Shelton are reluctant to report rapes. They don't report them in 
communities where newspapers protect the identity of rape victims, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very bad when a rape victim says she has been raped a second time by 
the newspaper," said his son Charlie Gay in an editorial, "but we feel she is a 
victim of society's stigma, not our trial coverage." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, his father believes that they should print the names to encourage 
society to stop stigmatizing the crime of rape. "I think I feel as deeply for 
those victims as anyone," Henry Gay said. "But I'm not changing our policy 
because I think in the long run it would cause more pain for all of the (future 
victims)."

PARENTS MAY NEED TO SUPPLEMENT QUALITY OF DAY-CARE CENTER MENUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bobbie Seymour was looking forward to the mother-daughter luncheon at her 
daughter's day-care center -- until she saw the food. "The French fries were 
cold," says Seymour, a Chino Hills mother who works as a clerk-typist. "The 
hamburger meat was gray. And I was hungry. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I thought, maybe this is good compared to what they usually get." 
</P>
<P>
The working mother was so upset with the junk-food quality of day-care lunches 
that from then on, she carefully packed a nutritional lunch for her daughter to 
take to school. 
</P>
<P>
That move makes good sense to a group of Texas researchers who just published 
disturbing news about day-care center menus in the Journal of the American 
Dietetic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey of 40 licensed centers, they found menus often skimp on iron-rich 
foods and sufficient varieties of fruits. And the quantities of food often fell 
below government guidelines. For instance, the children should have gotten 50% 
to 66% of their total recommended daily calories, but they only received 44% on 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Parents may compound the nutritional dilemmas after they pick up the famished 
child. "In response to their children's hungry irritability, parents may allow 
snacks on the drive home that are convenient but high in fat and empty 
calories," the researchers reported. By dinner, a child's appetite is spoiled, 
along with the chance to compensate for the day long deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, parents who pay the most for day care may have the most to worry 
about nutrition, child care experts say. "Some low-income children may be 
eating better than wealthier children because their day care centers are 
regulated by a state food program, which requires submission of menus and 
documentation of food purchases," says Ken Jaffe of the International Child 
Resource Institute, a Berkeley-based clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe suggests that parents become more familiar with good nutrition 
themselves: "Ask to see a menu and have lunch at the center one day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Value of Sisterly Love 
</P>
<P>
Staying on good terms with your sister won't just win you points at the next 
family reunion. It might even spare you depression in your golden years. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent Purdue University study, psychologist Vince Cicirelli found that 
men and women who maintain long-term, harmonious relationships with a sister 
are less likely to be depressed in later life. 
</P>
<P>
The same benefit wasn't evident in close bonds between brothers. Cicirelli 
isn't sure why, but he suggests that, raised in an era of traditional sex-role 
conditioning, subjects may look more to women for nurturing and consequently 
developed closer relationships with their sisters. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, Cicirelli interviewed 83 people -- 54 women and 29 men -- ranging 
in age from 61 to 91 years. More than half were widowed; 39% were married; and 
5% never married. Subjects first rated their feelings of closeness, rivalry and 
indifference, then took a standard depression test. 
</P>
<P>
Squabbles between older siblings often reflect deeper problems, adds Irene 
Goldenberg, a UCLA family therapist: "If you're still fighting with your sister 
at 73, it says something about your basic ability for conflict resolution." 
</P>
<P>
But it's never too late to work out those conflicts. In therapy sessions, 
Goldenberg has witnessed older siblings iron out lifelong difficulties and reap 
the benefits. "Siblings are truly a rich resource for older people because they 
lose so many people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A New Measles Policy 
</P>
<P>
For 30 years, children have needed a single measles vaccination. But in the 
wake of several virulent measles outbreaks, including one last year that 
sidelined USC star quarterback Rodney Peete and 37 other students, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics has just reversed its one-shot policy.

The academy now strongly recommends that all children should get a second shot. 
In cities where there have been measles outbreaks, all family members under age 
32 also should get that second shot. (Explains an academy spokesman: Almost all 
people born before 1957 had measles and are therefore immune.) 
</P>
<P>
The academy also proposes a new shot schedule, with the first measles vaccine 
to be given at age 15 months (or 12 months, if recurrent measles outbreaks have 
been reported locally); the second dose to be given before entering junior high 
or middle school. 
</P>
<P>
But some doctors don't think patients should wait that long for the second 
shot. "The ideal schedule is to get the first dose at 12 months and the second 
before kindergarten," says Dr. James D. Cherry, a UCLA pediatrics professor who 
recommends vaccinations for anyone who never contracted measles, regardless of 
age. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services offers free measles 
vaccinations for children. To find the nearest county health center, look in 
the white pages under "Government Offices," suggests a health services 
spokeswoman.

It may be more important than ever to eat an apple a day to keep the doctor 
away. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study cites white coat hypertension, a term coined for people whose 
blood pressure rises in the presence of a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Such occurrences can cause misdiagnosis for as many as 1-in-5 patients. 
According to the study, as many as 20% of patients treated for hypertension may 
be receiving unnecessary medication. 
</P>
<P>
Many doctors fear the side effects of medications aiming to lower blood 
pressure may be too dangerous for the borderline patient.

LUJAN TO DEFEND OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING AS VITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a defiant response to a proposed congressional ban on offshore drilling, 
Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr. intends to herald offshore oil as 
the solution to the nation's energy needs and to accuse drilling opponents of 
seeking to "bury our heads in the sands of our own ignorance," according to the 
text of a Lujan speech to be delivered today. 
</P>
<P>
Warning that the nation's appetite for energy is matched only by its apparent 
hostility toward future oil exploration, Lujan will declare: "The current 
situation is a time bomb waiting to explode." 
</P>
<P>
The strongly worded remarks, prepared for a major address on oil policy that 
Lujan plans to give in Long Beach, Calif., represent the Bush Administration's 
first concerted effort to staunch the wave of anti-drilling sentiment produced 
by the recent rash of oil spills. A copy of the speech was made available to 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
With the Senate apparently prepared to follow the House in putting much of the 
nation's coastline off limits to drilling for at least a year, the speech marks 
an aggressive attempt by the Administration to restore support for an energy 
policy that views offshore oil as a vital resource. 
</P>
<P>
"Our answer to this current energy crisis lies just several miles off our 
shores and in Alaska," Lujan will declare. 
</P>
<P>
While the address reiterates President Bush's commitment not to pursue oil 
development at the expense of the environment, its tone is reminiscent of the 
strong advocacy of offshore drilling of Interior secretaries in the Ronald 
Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
As such, it provides the clearest indication to date that the Bush 
Administration -- despite the appointment of a task force to review 
controversial drilling proposals -- has no intention of supporting sweeping 
changes in the nation's drilling plans. 
</P>
<P>
Bowing to environmental concerns, Lujan plans to acknowledge publicly today 
that he is considering barring oil tankers from most of the nation's ports, 
requiring them instead to unload their cargoes at offshore "super ports" from 
which oil would be pumped inland by undersea pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, first disclosed by The Times, reflects the disproportionate tanker 
role in oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
One such deep-water port is already in place off the Louisiana coast, and Lujan 
plans to suggest today that similar structures could "greatly reduce" the risks 
of collision and oil spills in Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia and Valdez, 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lujan's speech scorns the "clamor" of opposition to offshore 
drilling and challenges as "unfounded" the view that drilling programs present 
unacceptable environmental risks. 
</P>
<P>
"By imposing these moratoria," Lujan will declare, "the Congress is saying that 
we should blindly reject even the possibilities before us, burying our heads in 
the sands of our ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
White House Approval 
</P>
<P>
A senior aide to Lujan said that department officials expect the address, which 
has been approved by the White House, to draw a strong negative reaction from 
the environmental community. But with control of the debate over oil 
exploration slipping beyond the Administration's grasp, he said, "Lujan had to 
make a sound loud enough to shake things up." 
</P>
<P>
The near-collapse of pro-drilling forces in the House last week forced the 
Administration to abandon a planned attempt to block the drilling moratorium 
proposal on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
Among the salvos in his counteroffensive today, Lujan plans to include a 
conciliatory gesture, saying that he appreciates "the sincerity and the 
well-meaning intentions of all those who are concerned with the environmental 
impact of drilling . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Lujan will argue that the nation's growing appetite for imported oil makes it 
necessary for the United States to develop new offshore oil resources if it is 
to avoid becoming even more dependent on foreign oil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Future 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot avoid the reality that these stark facts present," Lujan will say. 
"Our national security and our economic future are dependent upon the decisions 
we make about our nation's energy policy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Time is running out," he will say, "and we need to have a firm and predictable 
outer continental shelf leasing program if we are going to successfully meet 
this challenge." 
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Lujan also plans to redouble his advocacy of Administration 
plans to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where scheduled 
oil exploration has come under renewed controversy in the wake of the Exxon 
Valdez oil spill in March. 
</P>
<P>
"The choice we face is not between oil or the environment," Lujan will say. "It 
is a choice between utilizing our vast domestic energy resources in an 
environmentally sound manner or holding our nation's energy hostage to a 
volatile and unpredictable world."

BUSH WELCOMED BY DUTCH, CALLS FOR EAST-WEST UNITY

LEIDEN, the Netherlands 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, given a fond, friendly welcome Monday in the Dutch town that 
sheltered the Pilgrims before they reached America, saluted the lessening of 
tensions across Europe and said the West now has the opportunity "to integrate 
the Soviet Union into the community of nations." 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge we face is clear: We must work together toward the day when all 
of Europe -- East and West -- is free of discord, free of division," Bush said, 
speaking from the pulpit of the Pieterskerk, a towering brick church dedicated 
in 1121. 
</P>
<P>
In an address to the citizens of Leiden, a storybook town of small shops, 
narrow streets and the ubiquitous canals of coastal Holland on the North Sea, 
Bush offered an optimistic view of East-West relations on the next-to-last day 
of a 10-day trip to Poland, Hungary, France and the Netherlands. He is due back 
in Washington today. 
</P>
<P>
"We will play a constructive role in Eastern Europe's economic development, in 
the development of political pluralism -- and in creating an international 
climate in which reform can succeed," the President pledged, to an audience 
that included Queen Beatrix and her husband, Prince Claus. 
</P>
<P>
"Improved relations with the U.S.S.R. reduce pressure on the nations of Eastern 
Europe -- especially those on the cutting edge of reform," Bush said, adding: 
"The new world we seek is a commonwealth of free nations working in concert, a 
world where more and more nations enter a widening circle of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
He said that "the Soviet Union has nothing to fear from the reforms that are 
now unfolding in some of the nations of Eastern Europe." He pledged to follow 
"a carefully calibrated approach" in addressing the needs of the political and 
economic reform that has been the focus of his journey. 
</P>
<P>
The visit to the Netherlands, during which Bush also conferred in The Hague, 
the seat of government, with Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, was the first by an 
American President. 
</P>
<P>
It was viewed as an opportunity to thank the Dutch for the political support 
they have provided in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, supporting U.S. 
efforts to build up NATO military hardware at a time when much of Western 
Europe has balked. 
</P>
<P>
The President's arrival turned Leiden, the birthplace of the Dutch master 
Rembrandt, into a well-mannered carnival, with the blue-, white- and 
red-striped Dutch flag displayed with the American flag throughout the town, 
local residents lining the streets and small knots of demonstrators mixing 
their protest signs with less-political messages. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, one group attacked funding for the anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua, 
another criticized the President's anti-abortion stand and another banner 
stretched across his motorcade route read "Buy Your Wood Shoes Over Here, Mr. 
President." 
</P>
<P>
"We are a small country, but we do occupy ourselves with a lot of problems in 
the whole world," said a Dutch tourist office aide. 
</P>
<P>
Leiden, which its mayor, G. H. Goekoop, said lies "in the middle of the world 
-- between Amsterdam and Rotterdam, London and Berlin, Washington and Moscow," 
has a history to match the message of the President's address. 
</P>
<P>
In 1609, the Pilgrims settled here in their flight from religious persecution 
in England. They remained until 1620, when they sailed to the New World. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the American reality began right here, began when the Pilgrims 
asked for refuge," the mayor said in his introduction of Bush. 
</P>
<P>
It was in Leiden that the United Provinces of the Netherlands were founded in 
1579, becoming the first democratic form of government here. And its bill of 
rights, written in 1609, led it to become a haven for political refugees -- a 
reputation it holds to this day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refuge From Nazi Occupiers 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Bush pointed out, "behind these walls above the rafters, 
Resistance fighters, university students, took refuge from the forces of (Nazi) 
occupation and found safe haven in this church." 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic history of the church fed the emotion of the moment, as did the 
brief recital by the Bach Chorus of Holland and the Amsterdam Chamber Orchestra 
of the J. S. Bach cantata "Softly flow with gentle murmurings, you rippling 
waves," a unique introduction for a presidential speech on East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who has grown increasingly optimistic in his remarks about 
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union as his trip progressed, told his audience 
here that "today, as when the Pilgrims left this city, a new world lies within 
our reach." 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that the unnatural division of Europe will now come to an end -- 
that the Europe behind the wall will join its neighbors to the West, prosperous 
and free," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's 25-hour visit to the Netherlands was marked by the usual tight security 
surrounding the President overseas. Dutch law strictly forbids carrying 
weapons, and the Secret Service depends heavily on a large, hidden arsenal to 
provide protection. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the possible discrepancy between Dutch law and Secret Service 
behavior, one Dutchman said when asked about the agents' weapons: "We haven't 
asked, and we don't want to know." 
</P>
<P>
Dutch officials seemed bemused by Bush's mammoth motorcade, with its three 
limousines and squadrons of staff vans, which snaked through narrow, 
cobblestoned streets at a fraction of its usual speed. 
</P>
<P>
The reason was soon clear: Only hours after Bush's entourage roared out of the 
medieval courtyard of the Parliament building in The Hague, Lubbers decided it 
was time to head home as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch leader walked out the door of his office accompanied by exactly two 
aides. When four young men on the sidewalk called to him -- "Hey! Mr. Lubbers!" 
-- he ambled over for a chat. 
</P>
<P>
Then, still unprotected by any visible security, he walked across the street, 
got into his car and went home.

BAN OF COMMON AIR CONDITIONERS FOR AUTOS SOUGHT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As temperatures outside the Capitol soared toward 100, Assemblyman John 
Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) said Monday that he will introduce a bill to ban 
the sale of the most common kind of auto air conditioning units within two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
He insists that Californians would be willing to sweat out their summers, if 
necessary, in the fight against the depletion of the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want to be hot, or dead?" Vasconcellos said from his air-conditioned 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is designed to reduce the amount of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 
released into the atmosphere from auto, home and office air conditioners. It 
would ban the sale of cars with air conditioning in the state after Jan. 1, 
1991, unless manufacturers come up with a less harmful cooling method. After 
1992, the sale of building air conditioners that release chlorofluorocarbons 
would also be banned. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have said that CFCs are a major villain in the destruction of the 
ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays. Air 
conditioning emissions may make up as much as one quarter of all atmospheric 
CFCs, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Vasconcellos, chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, was 
instrumental in the banning of CFCs in aerosol spray cans in the state 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although his Oldsmobile is equipped with air conditioning, Vasconcellos said he 
refuses to use it. He said he does not use an artificial cooling system in his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Holes in the ozone layer have already been documented at the North and South 
poles, and there is growing evidence of a hole over the Equator, Vasconcellos 
said. People will see the benefits of sweat when the incidence of skin cancer 
begins to spiral upward, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The naivete of people who think they can't live without (air conditioning) 
just baffles me. Folks did live without it once upon a time," Vasconcellos 
said.

SOLICITED DONATIONS FROM FIRM CHIEF, CRANSTON SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston, already under fire for aiding Phoenix businessman Charles 
H. Keating in his battles with savings and loan regulators, said Monday that he 
solicited a $400,000 donation from Keating for a voter registration group 
formed by the senator's son. 
</P>
<P>
The California Democrat said he also asked Keating in 1987 and 1988 to donate a 
total of $450,000 to two other nonprofit, nonpartisan voter registration groups 
"because of my determination to do what I can to increase voter participation." 
</P>
<P>
Keating is the chairman of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, which owns 
Lincoln Savings and Loan. The Irvine thrift was seized by regulators in April, 
one day after American Continental filed for bankruptcy. Regulators claimed 
that the company was operating Lincoln unsafely and dissipating the S&amp;L's 
$5.3 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1988, American Continental gave $400,000 to the Center for 
Participation in Democracy Inc., a Los Angeles organization formed by 
Cranston's son, Kim, to train organizers and carry out nonpartisan voter 
registration drives. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said Monday in a written statement that none of the funds he solicited 
went to him "personally or politically." 
</P>
<P>
Since the bankruptcy of American Continental and seizure of Lincoln, Cranston's 
relationship to Keating has come under scrutiny, particularly by investors who 
bought $200 million worth of American Continental debt securities through the 
Lincoln branches. Those bondholders claim they were falsely led to believe that 
the bonds were federally insured, and have filed lawsuits claiming they were 
defrauded by Keating and other American Continental executives and professional 
advisers for the company. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits contend that Keating and his associates made large campaign 
contributions to numerous politicians, who in turn helped Keating keep his 
business afloat by representing his cause before regulators. Keating donated 
$39,000 to Cranston's 1986 reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
At Keating's behest, Cranston joined other senators in two meetings with 
regulators in April, 1987. A week later, Cranston and four other senators 
talked with federal regulators from the board's San Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
In March and early April of this year, Cranston talked with two bank board 
members to urge them to consider approving Keating's effort to sell Lincoln. 
Regulators had refused to approve the sale, saying the proposed buyers simply 
did not have enough cash to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said Monday that he "did do a pretty stupid thing, politically" in 
giving the appearance that he had interceded to win favorable treatment of 
Keating. But he said he did nothing improper in trying to get "fair play" for a 
California firm. 
</P>
<P>
The senator also denied doing anything improper in soliciting money for worthy 
causes, such as his son's voter-registration group. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Cranston, 37, founded the Center for Participation in Democracy, a 
nonprofit organization that trains organizers and carries out nonpartisan voter 
education and registration drives. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Cranston, who now works in Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy's office in Sacramento, 
could not be reached for comment Monday. State records show that American 
Continental gave the money to the center in February, 1988. The amount 
represented 29% of the center's $1.4-million budget for its fiscal year, which 
ended May 31, 1988.

HE'S WINNING OVER SKEPTICS, QUAYLE SAYS AT L.A. MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle said Monday that he is winning over those who had 
doubts about his ability to handle the job but acknowledged that he still has a 
tendency toward the occasional gaffe. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of skeptics during the campaign about how I would work out, 
but now they're seeing it work out in a very normal, comfortable way," Quayle 
said at a breakfast meeting with reporters in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In a four-day visit to California, Quayle is touring aerospace facilities, 
hosting fund-raisers for U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson's 1990 gubernatorial campaign 
and speaking to the Western Governors' Conference in Long Beach and the 
Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting with reporters Monday, the affable Quayle tensed up only once, 
and that was when he was asked about his slip-up two days ago in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
There, Quayle, speaking of the 20th anniversary of America's moon walk, got 
mixed up and referred to astronaut Buzz Aldrin as "Buz Lukens." 
</P>
<P>
Republican Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens of Ohio was recently convicted of having 
sex with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, everybody can make a mistake," Quayle said Monday, blushing deeply and 
fiddling with his coffee cup. "If that's the worst thing I do in the next six 
months, then the first six months will be in pretty good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Such slips are not even news for most politicians, but for the 42-year-old vice 
president they raise old, and some say unfair, questions about his maturity and 
competence. 
</P>
<P>
So real is the "gaffe watch" with Quayle that reporters who trail him switch on 
their tape recorders for even the most mundane and predictable events. 
</P>
<P>
And he is very attuned to it. Coming into the breakfast with reporters after a 
break, he said, "You guys talking behind my back?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Quayle said, he knows he has a tendency to mispeak, as when he told the 
United Negro College Fund recently, "What a waste it is to lose one's mind" a 
confusion of the group's slogan, "A mind is a terrible thing to waste." 
</P>
<P>
But, he countered, "I think I'm being reviewed well as vice president because 
people see how I am performing -- the responsibility I have, the working 
relationship I have with the President. " 
</P>
<P>
Quayle Press Secretary David Beckwith said the vice president has so much 
access to President Bush that the President's current European trip has given 
Quayle and his staff their first break in some time. 
</P>
<P>
During the breakfast interview, Quayle left to take a call from Bush, who was 
in the Netherlands. Quayle refused to say what they discussed, in keeping with 
his desire to model himself after Bush, who rarely revealed his conversations 
with former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle is clearly starting to relax, but the memories of the rough 1988 
campaign continue to sting. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'd wish that experience on anybody else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go through that kind of day-in-and-day-out barrage, you really have 
to dig down deep inside and ask yourself what you're made of," he added. "Do 
you have it? You had to set it aside and look at the goal. . . . When you 
looked at yourself in the mirror in the morning you had to realize that what 
had gotten you to the place you are is yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"And the one critical mistake that I made was to rely on the advice of others. 
If I had it to do over again, I'd do it differently. . . . I would have been a 
lot more accessible to the press from the outset. I wouldn't have allowed 
myself to be in that controlled situation. I share the blame. I could have told 
them to go to hell but I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
A new book about the campaign quotes some of Quayle's former advisers as making 
fun of him. But he refused Monday to discuss them or their charges and seemed 
eager to forgive and forget. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was back to trusting his own political instincts, which got him 
elected to the Senate in 1980 at the age of 33. 
</P>
<P>
Those instincts have led him, he said, to conclude that on an issue such as 
abortion, the anti-abortion side -- of which he is a strong partisan -- will do 
well to take some limited victories in the wake of the recent Supreme Court 
decision giving states more power to regulate abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-abortion side, he said, "will want to set certain pro-life standards" 
that include requiring a minor to have parental consent for an abortion and the 
banning of abortions in public hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Americans would support that," Quayle said. "Most people in America 
support the right of women to have an abortion . . . but most Americans still 
would rather give preference to the unborn than to abortion on demand." 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Times editors and reporters, Quayle said he thought the 
Supreme Court's abortion ruling will help the Republican Party, rather than 
push it out of the mainstream, as some pundits have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP's willingness to compromise and regulate abortions rather than ban 
them, Quayle contended, will contrast with "the pro-choice forces who will 
dominate the debate and say there should be no restrictions at all. I don't 
think that will play well in the public domain."

POLES, VATICAN RESUME FULL TIES AFTER 44 YEARS

The Vatican and Poland restored full diplomatic relations Monday, paving the 
way for the first exchange of ambassadors between the Holy See and a Warsaw 
Pact country. 
</P>
<P>
The resumption of formal diplomatic ties after 44 years was announced 
simultaneously by the Vatican and the Polish news agency, marking the climax of 
lengthy negotiations between a skeptical Polish Pope and a Communist government 
locked in a struggle with political reform and anxious to enhance its 
credibility at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, where 95% of the 38 million people are Roman Catholics, the news was 
welcomed by church officials. They had been skeptical when the negotiations 
were first undertaken, fearing that the Communist authorities would attempt to 
undermine the local church hierarchy by dealing directly with the Vatican 
envoy. 
</P>
<P>
The skepticism seemed prudent in a country where Communist leaders, in the 
Stalinist period, had done their best to suppress the church. 
</P>
<P>
After severing diplomatic ties with the Vatican in 1945, the Communists placed 
the Polish primate, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, under house arrest. Church 
property was confiscated and ordinary priests were arrested and harassed by the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Benefits for the Whole Society' 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Monday, the Polish bishops said they greeted the renewal of 
relations with the Vatican with "the deep conviction that a proper development 
of relations will influence the realization of citizens' rights in Poland and 
open a new field of church activities with benefits for the whole society." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Stefan Staniszewski, called it "a very 
important fact that crowns a long process of normalization of relations between 
the state and the church." 
</P>
<P>
Some Polish government officials had expected that diplomatic relations would 
be restored two years ago, when Pope John Paul II made his third papal trip to 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pope could not be rushed, despite a strenuous campaign by the Polish 
authorities and the opening of a cautious dialogue with Communist officials in 
order to win concessions for the church. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope, who received Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity independent trade 
union, in Rome on April 20, follows Polish political events closely. In June, 
the first relatively free elections in the postwar era resulted in a new 
National Assembly in which Solidarity-backed candidates won 46% of the seats. 
Two months ago, the Parliament granted legal recognition to the church. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15-Year Working Relationship 
</P>
<P>
A working relationship between the Polish government and the Vatican goes back 
15 years, to a time when authorities hoped to win public support by easing its 
tough stand on the church. 
</P>
<P>
The contacts intensified about four years ago for the same reasons as the 
Communist leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, pressed his campaign for "national 
unity" after the martial-law crackdown that suppressed Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
The role of the church, always close to Solidarity, was central in laying the 
groundwork for the "round table" talks between the government and Solidarity 
that resulted in the union's legal reinstatement and the June elections. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent church laymen were also key intermediaries between the government and 
Solidarity in two rounds of strikes in 1988, a role that helped establish the 
church as a referee between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican's relations with Hungary and the Soviet Union also have improved in 
the liberalized mood inspired by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate announcement on a papal nuncio, or ambassador, to 
Poland, but there has been speculation that it could be Archbishop Gabriel 
Montalvo, a Colombian who is the papal nuncio to Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Nonaligned Yugoslavia is the only Communist country in Eastern Europe with 
diplomatic ties to the Vatican. The Vatican also has full relations with 
Communist Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
The last papal ambassador to Poland left Warsaw on Sept. 5, 1939, at the start 
of World War II.

SOLIDARITY GETS JARUZELSKI VIEW ON PRESIDENCY

Communist leader Wojciech Jaruzelski met with Solidarity lawmakers Monday in an 
apparent effort to broaden support for him as a presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gen. Jaruzelski announced June 30 that he would not be a candidate for 
the presidency, the Communist Party has asked him to reconsider. In recent days 
he has won the support of his own party and one of its Communist allies, the 
United Peasants' Party. 
</P>
<P>
The president is to be chosen by majority vote of the National Assembly (Sejm) 
and the newly created Senate in an election expected Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski withdrew after the Communists' allies in Parliament, the Peasants 
and the Democratic Party, hesitated to give him their support. Although the 
Peasants voted last week to support him, the Democrats have remained on the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity, the independent trade union movement, has 259 votes (46% of the 
total) and could assure Jaruzelski's election, but it is not likely to endorse 
him. Still, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, noting that Poland's internal and 
international situation requires a Communist president, said last week that he 
would cooperate with Jaruzelski if he is elected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Solidarity's Reluctant Support 
</P>
<P>
Walesa's quasi-endorsement suggested that Solidarity lawmakers, however 
reluctantly, might cast just enough votes to ensure Jaruzelski's election if 
the ill-disciplined Communist coalition fails to hold together. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski has not officially revoked his withdrawal announcement, but he is 
clearly campaigning for the post. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with the Solidarity lawmakers was closed, but some of the members 
indicated they were not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same thing he's been saying for years," said Jozef Lisz, a leader of 
Farmers' Solidarity and a deputy Speaker of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity lawmakers have said in recent weeks that a vote for Jaruzelski would 
be difficult for them to explain to an electorate that blames Jaruzelski for 
the imposition of martial law in 1981 and the suppression of Solidarity.

U.S. TO PAY FOR NON-IRANIANS IT SHOT DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration said Monday that it has begun discussions with India, 
Italy, Pakistan, Yugoslavia and the United Arab Emirates to arrange 
compensation payments for the deaths of the 40 non-Iranians killed when a U.S. 
warship shot down an Iranian civilian airliner last year. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the Administration decided to 
expedite payments to the families of the non-Iranians instead of waiting for 
the resolution of a Washington-Tehran dispute, which has stymied a U.S. 
compensation offer for the 250 Iranian victims. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the non-Iranians were 10 Indians, one Italian, six Pakistanis, 17 
citizens of the Emirates and six Yugoslavs. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, the United States has offered to pay $250,000 per full-time 
wage-earning victim and $100,000 for each of all the other victims," Boucher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the United States and Iraq agreed earlier this year on $27.3 
million in compensation to the families of the 37 crew members killed when an 
Iraqi jet attacked the U.S. Navy frigate Stark in 1987 in the Persian Gulf. 
That is an average of $739,200 per victim. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. cruiser Vincennes downed Iran Air Flight 655 with an anti-aircraft 
missile on July 3, 1988, after the ship's crew mistook the civilian jumbo jet 
for an Iran air force F-14. Eight days later, then-President Ronald Reagan 
offered to pay compensation, but only as an act of charity. Reagan said the 
United States refused to accept blame for the incident, which occurred shortly 
after the Vincennes engaged in a brief exchange of fire with Iranian gunboats. 
</P>
<P>
"During the past year, the United States has developed an appropriate plan for 
paying ex gratia compensation," Boucher said. "On July 10, 1989, the United 
States instructed its embassies in India, Italy, Pakistan, Yugoslavia and the 
United Arab Emirates to approach the governments in those countries proposing 
that specific payments be accepted on behalf of their nationals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tehran Drags Its Feet 
</P>
<P>
"The same offer has been communicated to the government of Iran," he said. 
"Unfortunately, during the past year the government of Iran has ignored 
repeated efforts by the United States to obtain information on the families of 
the Iranian victims. The United States stands ready to make payments to these 
families so long as the government of Iran permits an appropriate intermediary 
to distribute the funds to the families." 
</P>
<P>
The United States refuses to make payments directly to the Iranian government, 
insisting that the money be funneled through an intermediary. So far, Iran has 
rejected that condition. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said that Washington demanded a middleman for payments to Iranians 
because the United States has no diplomatic relations with Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said that the total outlay could reach $30 
million if the U.S. terms are extended to include the Iranian victims. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who briefed reporters on the understanding that he not be named, 
said that the U.S. offer was "a humanitarian gesture," made even though the 
commander of the warship was justified in authorizing firing in self-defense in 
the heat of battle.

AFTER 27 YEARS IN S. AFRICA PRISONS, 'SPIRITS ARE MARVELOUS'; 
</P>
<P>
FOR MANDELA AT 71, FREEDOM LOOMS LARGER THAN EVER

<TEXT>
<P>
In the heart of South Africa's cool, pine-scented wine country, Nelson R. 
Mandela rises early each morning to work out on his exercise bicycle. He spends 
the rest of the day reading newspapers and books, writing in his journal or 
listening to radio or TV newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
He has no telephone, but, for the first time since he went to prison in 1962, 
he sees frequent visitors from the outside, including political associates, and 
a few of them are allowed to stay for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely at 4 p.m., though, the fence around Mandela's large ranch-style house 
is locked, and the world's most famous prisoner -- a beacon of hope to millions 
of South Africa's voteless blacks -- is left with his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"His spirits are marvelous," said Fatima Meer, his biographer, who met with 
Mandela last week. "We can all take a lesson from him. He's the one who 
inspires us when we go in, not the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela turns 71 today, after the most tumultuous year of his 27 in prison, a 
year in which the government launched an attempt to demythologize Mandela and 
improve its own international image by slowly and publicly removing 
restrictions on the leader of the outlawed African National Congress. Now 
Mandela is as close as he's ever been to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Mandela lived in a prison cell at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, 
where he was restricted to 40-minute visits from a handful of family and 
friends. But then Mandela contracted tuberculosis, was hospitalized and, after 
recuperating at a private Cape Town clinic, was transferred to a spacious house 
on the grounds of Victor Verster Prison Farm here, about 40 miles from Cape 
Town. 
</P>
<P>
His house, usually reserved for white prison officials rather than captives, 
has three bedrooms, a gymnasium, a lounge and a swimming pool with sweeping 
mountain views. It's a lonely existence, but his visitation rights have been 
loosened considerably. In recent weeks, for instance, he has met for hours at a 
time with men the government considers dangerous figures in the ANC, Govan 
Mbeki and Harry Gwala. 
</P>
<P>
And more than a dozen family members, including his wife, Winnie, plan to 
gather here today to celebrate his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials say Mandela's release, while not possible before 
September's elections, may nevertheless be only a matter of months away. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Mandela was taken to the presidential mansion for tea with 
the head of the white minority-led government, President Pieter W. Botha. 
Although largely symbolic, their first face-to-face meeting was a reminder that 
top government officials are worried about growing international pressure to 
release Mandela and negotiate with the country's black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of Mandela's release is the biggest unknown factor in South Africa's 
future, political analysts say. Looked up to by millions of black South 
Africans, Mandela is considered a unifying force among blacks -- as well as a 
strong bridge between blacks and the country's fearful whites. 
</P>
<P>
But conservative government officials worry that a free Mandela could trigger 
unrest in the country -- particularly if the three-year-old state of emergency, 
preventing most black political gatherings, and the ban on groups such as the 
ANC remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
Other senior officials worry that Mandela's incarceration continues to give the 
world a club with which to hammer South Africa. And, those officials warn, 
Mandela's death in prison would set back, perhaps irretrievably, any hope of 
negotiations with the black majority in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela himself has told friends he does not expect to be freed soon. 
</P>
<P>
Recent visitors say the nationalist leader, serving a life term for sabotage 
and conspiracy to overthrow the government, is extremely fit, intellectually 
sharp and highly conversant in current events. 
</P>
<P>
"He never takes an extreme position on world affairs," Meer said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela recently completed an advanced law degree by correspondence from the 
University of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Few of South Africa's blacks have ever seen Mandela. But those who have served 
time in prison with him invariably mention his almost regal bearing: graying, 6 
feet tall, with a precise English accent. 
</P>
<P>
"Mandela is like that. When he sits down, you feel as if a king has sat down," 
says one former Robben Island inmate. 
</P>
<P>
A. B. Claasen, a black man who pumps gas at the service station down the road 
from Victor Verster Prison, is typical of those who have never laid eyes on 
Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
"Things will change in South Africa when Nelson is released," he said last 
week. "And they'll change for the better."

U.S. AND SOVIETS REPORTEDLY AGREE ON PLAN TO BAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS

The United States and the Soviet Union have reached agreement on key elements 
of a treaty banning chemical weapons, including a timetable for destroying them 
and procedures for inspecting chemical factories, according to the New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, citing Bush Administration officials, said in today's editions 
that the superpowers' recommendations will be submitted to the 40-nation 
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official told the newspaper that the two sides have agreed 
in principle on "a mathematical formula" prescribing the amounts and types of 
chemical weapons to be destroyed over a 10-year period. 
</P>
<P>
They also reportedly agreed on procedures for highly intrusive surprise 
inspections at sites where one country suspects the other of cheating. 
</P>
<P>
The draft treaty would ban the development, production, possession and transfer 
of chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Geneva Protocol of 1925, adopted after poison gas in World War I produced 
1.3 million casualties, prohibits the use of chemical weapons, but not their 
manufacture or stockpiling. 
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-Soviet agreement, some chemical weapons and production equipment 
would be destroyed annually, but each country could retain some weapons to 
protect itself until the end of the 10-year transition period. 
</P>
<P>
If it is ratified, the new agreement could curtail the spread of chemical 
weapons by making it more difficult for Third World nations like Libya and Iraq 
-- prime suspects in the use or manufacture of such weapons -- to obtain them, 
the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union also agreed to a comprehensive exchange 
of data on chemical weapons, including sites for their production and storage, 
said James H. Granger, the deputy head of the U.S. delegation to the Geneva 
conference.

Bystanders did nothing to help two toddlers who had fallen into a swimming 
pool, said an emergency official who was able to save one of the children.

<P>
Fire Capt. C. A. Beasley pulled the two girls from the pool Sunday, but one of 
them, 15-month-old Tiffidie Anne McGough, was dead. Her 2-year-old half-sister, 
Taffidie, was in critical condition Monday in Texas Children's Hospital. Their 
mother was asleep in a nearby apartment when the girls fell into the water. 
</P>
<P>
Beasley told the Houston Chronicle that two men were standing by the apartment 
house pool when he arrived, and they told him there were "dolls or dogs" in the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what they thought they were, I can't imagine anybody standing 
there looking at two kids in the pool," Beasley said.

HOUSE BACKS BILL TO GIVE BLM STRONGER ENVIRONMENTAL ROLE

The House approved a bill Monday that seeks to bolster the environmental role 
of the Bureau of Land Management in its stewardship over 270 million acres of 
federal land, most of it in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Enactment of the measure, which the House adopted by voice vote, would mark the 
first formal reauthorization of the BLM by Congress in seven years. The bill 
now goes to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Among the key provisions of the bill is the reinstatement of a congressional 
mandate that the deputy director, assistant directors and state directors of 
BLM be nonpolitical, career appointees. 
</P>
<P>
The Ronald Reagan Administration interpreted the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act 
as allowing those posts to go to political appointees, who, critics charged, 
largely failed to enforce conservation measures under federal land management 
statutes. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the BLM has operated without authorization since 1982, but the 
Interior Department agency has continued to receive money under a waiver of 
House rules. 
</P>
<P>
The bill approved Monday was introduced as a reauthorization measure to allow 
for "such sums as may be necessary for the programs, functions and activities" 
of the BLM through fiscal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
However, the measure was amended by the Interior Committee to include a series 
of provisions generally aimed at forcing the BLM to give greater consideration 
to the environment in the management of public land and its natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental amendments were strongly opposed by Western Republicans on 
the panel, who argued that they are needless limits on mining, livestock 
grazing and other legitimate land uses. The amendments also are opposed by the 
Bush Administration.

NICOLAS GUILLEN, 87; KNOWN AS CUBA'S 'NATIONAL POET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nicolas Guillen, the Cuban poet who melded the dialect and speech patterns of 
Cuban blacks with African folklore and rhythms into a movement called poesia 
negra (black poetry), making him one of Latin America's best-known writers, 
died Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The official Mexican news agency Notimex, quoting the Cuban news agency Prensa 
Latina, said Monday he had died in Havana at age 87. 
</P>
<P>
Guillen, who came to be known as Cuba's "national poet" after the 1959 
revolution led by Fidel Castro, had suffered from advanced arteriosclerosis and 
Parkinson's disease. He had a leg amputated last month. 
</P>
<P>
Guillen was the mulatto son of a journalist who was first attracted to poetry 
by a 1930 visit to Cuba by black American poet Langston Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' leadership of the so-called Harlem Renaissance inspired Guillen's first 
successful verse collection, "Motivos de Son" ("Motifs of Sound.") The eight 
poems were structured like popular Cuban songs and dances interspersed with 
African elements. 
</P>
<P>
He became the first to give voice to the squalor that was the black slums of 
Havana. 
</P>
<P>
Guillen's work came to celebrate Cuba's multiracial and ethnic mix as well as 
the communist revolution that brought Castro to power. For more than 25 years 
he was director of Cuba's Union of Writers and Artists. 
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to have a clear-cut attitude. My poetry is a dynamic process. 
. . . It constantly supports and encourages the struggles of peoples against 
inequality and imperialism," he once said. 
</P>
<P>
Prensa Latina said word of his death sent a shock wave through Cuba's people, 
many of whom know his verses by heart. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them -- which exalt popular leaders while indicting foreign control -- 
have been translated into scores of languages. 
</P>
<P>
In the prologue to a book of what he called "mulatto" poetry, Guillen said: "In 
these verses perhaps enter the same elements that enter into the ethnic 
composition of Cuba, where we all are mestizos. . . . One day they will say: 
'Cuban color.' These poems anticipate this day." 
</P>
<P>
The passage was quoted by Prensa Latina in the dispatch monitored in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Guillen became a communist in 1937 and went to Spain to fight on the Loyalist 
side against the military uprising of Gen. Francisco Franco in the Spanish 
Civil War. He became well-known for his emotional readings of poetry to 
Loyalist troops. 
</P>
<P>
After the Spanish republic was crushed by Franco in 1939, Guillen returned to 
Cuba as an active communist and outspoken writer on political and social 
grievances. He was arrested several times by the government of Cuban leader 
Fulgencio Batista in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
From 1945 to 1948, Guillen had traveled in South America. Recollections of the 
trip were included in works published in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
When Guillen tried to return from a trip to Chile in 1953, Batista refused to 
let him into the country and he began a five-year exile. 
</P>
<P>
Castro's triumph brought Guillen back to his homeland where he became the poet 
laureate of the revolution. His 1964 verse "Tengo" ("I Have") praises the 
rebels, depicts Batista's flight and celebrates the Cuban victory over the 
American forces in the Bay of Pigs invasion. 
</P>
<P>
His "El Gran Zoo" ("The Great Zoo") taunts imperialism while musing on love, 
nature and the mystery of life itself. 
</P>
<P>
His "La Paloma de Vuelo Popular" ("The Dove of Popular Flight") includes 
elegies and is considered a masterpiece of the Spanish poetic genre. 
</P>
<P>
Guillen had been a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee in Cuba 
but he had retired from political activity. 
</P>
<P>
A prolific writer until his health failed, he was asked on his 70th birthday 
which of his poems he personally preferred. 
</P>
<P>
"Those I still haven't written," he answered. 
</P>
<P>
Prensa Latina said Guillen's body would lie in state in the Plaza of the 
Revolution in Havana and that a public funeral will be held today.

PROPOSAL TO END NORTHWEST TIMBER BATTLE REJECTED

Both the timber industry and the Forest Service on Monday rejected a proposal 
offered by environmentalists aimed at ending the fight over logging in the 
ancient forests of the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The rejections came as lawmakers from the region sought to craft a legislative 
compromise to ensure an adequate short-term supply of logs to keep the region's 
mills operating over the next 15 months and protect the old-growth forests that 
are prime habitat for the rare northern spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers had hoped to attach the compromise to the Interior Department 
appropriations bill when it was scheduled to go before a Senate appropriations 
subcommittee today, but the meeting has been put off until later in the week 
for unrelated reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers have made clear they will act whether or not the 
environmentalists and the industry agree. 
</P>
<P>
Industry representatives said the environmentalists' proposal would be 
"technically infeasible" because its restrictions on old-growth logging would 
make it impossible to meet the timber sales levels it envisions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a non-starter -- an offer of terms of surrender," Mark Rey, a vice 
president of the National Forest Products Assn., said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists' proposal would reduce the harvest over the next 15 
months to a level 400 million board-feet below that of an earlier plan. Rey 
said the result would be the loss of 7,000 jobs, $171 million in payrolls and 
$162 million in government revenue.

The U.S. Agency for International Development announced Monday a $17-million 
aid package to rehabilitate the Tanzania-Zambia railway. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to buy eight electric locomotives, spare parts, tools 
and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,150-mile railway, which links Tanzania's Indian Ocean port city of Dar es 
Salaam with Kapiri Mposhi, just north of Zambia's capital of Lusaka, was built 
with Chinese assistance in the early 1970s.

COURT REJECTS L.A.'S MOVE TO HALT STATE LANDFILL CURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge refused Monday to grant a request by the city of Los 
Angeles to block state restrictions on Lopez Canyon Landfill, which city 
officials say could force the dump to close within a year. 
</P>
<P>
However, Judge Dzintra I. Janavs made it clear that she expects operations at 
the Lake View Terrace dump, where two-thirds of the city's household trash is 
taken, to continue until the court rules on the rest of the city's case against 
the state Waste Management Board and the county health department. 
</P>
<P>
After denying the city's request for a temporary restraining order, Janavs 
ordered the case continued until Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I really need to issue a temporary restraining order because 
nothing is really going to happen before August," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Christopher M. Westhoff said he would return to court "as 
fast as my feet can get me over here" if the state follows through with its 
order, issued last week, that drastically limits the height and acreage of 
trash in the dump. 
</P>
<P>
The dump accepts about 4,000 tons of trash daily. Several private landfills and 
a county dump in Calabasas take the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling increases pressure on the county health department, which has 
been asked by the state to enforce the order by Friday. Deputy County Counsel 
Judith Fries said no decision has been reached on whether the county will carry 
out the state's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that the state does not have the authority to order us to 
take any action. It's simply a request," Fries said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the state does have the authority to step in and impose the 
restrictions itself, said Christopher Peck, spokesman for the state waste 
board. Peck said the board would await the county's decision before deciding 
whether to take that action. 
</P>
<P>
But Peck pointed out that board members were adamant in a hearing Friday in 
Sacramento that they want to see landfill operations scaled back to levels 
agreed to in 1978, when the dump's permit was issued. 
</P>
<P>
The original permit limited trash mounds to 1,725 feet high and said that 400 
trucks or fewer a day could dump on only 140 acres of the 392-acre site. The 
board conceded that a limit of 8,000 tons of trash a month included in that 
permit was probably a typographical error and set the limit at 3,100 tons a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
In defense, the city maintains that the county health department and the state 
misled city Bureau of Sanitation officials to believe that an engineering 
report submitted in 1983 updated the permit to allow more dumping. That report 
increased the tonnage to 4,075 tons, the height to more than 1,740 feet and the 
number of trucks to 500, which is close to present-day practice. 
</P>
<P>
"All parties were operating within the same parameters," Westhoff said. "It's 
only now, six years later, that the Waste Management Board seeks to overturn 
that 1983 document and in essence turn the clocks back." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom after Monday's hearing, Peck asked Westhoff what 
contingency plans the city has if the order sticks. 
</P>
<P>
"What contingency plan?" Westhoff responded. "We're going to have our trucks 
rushing to landfills to try to beat other trucks from other cities." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Edward Avila, president of the Board of Public Works, said that if 
the state order stands, Lopez Canyon would be able to remain open for only 
about a year, after a temporary two-month shutdown to prepare a new area for 
dumping. Currently the dump is scheduled to remain open until 1992 and the city 
is preparing a proposal to expand it and extend its life through at least 2001.

MOBIL IS ACCUSED OF SAFETY VIOLATIONS IN FATAL REFINERY BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mobil Oil Corp. and two top officials at its Torrance refinery have been 
charged with violating state safety standards in an explosion a year ago that 
killed a man and injured two others, according to documents released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The misdemeanor charges -- filed late Friday in order to avoid the deadline of 
a statute of limitations -- name refinery Manager Wyman Robb and Tom Gregory, 
then assistant refinery manager for Mobil, in a total of six separate counts of 
"willfully" violating occupational safety standards. The Mobil officials also 
each face an additional charge that they "induced others to knowingly or 
negligently violate the state safety code." 
</P>
<P>
Gregory, who has since been reassigned, was also accused of two counts of 
obstructing Torrance fire officials. According to court documents, one Mobil 
employee at the explosion scene put his hand in front of a fire investigator's 
camera and several others persuaded Mobil employees to stop talking to fire 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Penalties on each charge are jail terms up to six months and fines ranging from 
$1,000 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the fatal accident on July 15, 1988, Cal Cat Chemical employee Winston 
Alexander Jones, 30, of Harbor City was on top of a tank that exploded, killing 
him instantly. David Moustofi, 32, of Long Beach suffered second- and 
third-degree burns on 75% of his body and Jerry Lekberg, 41, of Oakland was 
burned on 5% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
In filing the charges against Mobil, Torrance City Prosecutor J. D. Lord also 
threatened to seek an unusual probation condition that would allow a judge to 
shut the refinery down if it failed to live up to other future conditions of 
its probation. 
</P>
<P>
Lord's office filed the charges after the district attorney's office decided 
that there was insufficient evidence to support felony involuntary manslaughter 
charges against the refinery's supervisors and management, said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Fred Macksoud. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt there was negligence but we didn't feel there was the gross 
negligence" necessary for a manslaughter conviction, said Macksoud, of the 
district attorney's Environmental Crimes Division. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Robb nor Gregory was available for comment. But Mobil spokesman Jim 
Carbonetti said, "We are surprised and disappointed" by the charges and vowed 
to contest them in court. 
</P>
<P>
Carbonetti added that company officials had cooperated fully with local, state 
and federal agencies and never had been advised about Torrance fire 
investigators' complaints of interference. The investigators said in their 
report that the explosion was probably caused by failure to follow proper 
procedures in handling chemicals that can react with each other violently. 
Investigators said that the explosion may also have been caused by sparks from 
the use of the wrong electrical cords or the failure to ground equipment 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the charges against the Mobil officials, a subcontracting firm 
also faces action. Charged with three counts each of violating safety standards 
-- but not willful or knowing negligence -- were the president, chief chemist 
and project manager of Cal Cat Chemical Co. of Benicia, a refinery 
subcontracting firm whose workers were cleaning the contaminated water storage 
tanks at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion July 15 is one of a number of mishaps to plague Mobil's refinery. 
The series of explosions, fires and accidents -- which began with an explosion 
and two-day fire in November, 1987 -- prompted a city lawsuit alleging that the 
refinery is a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, an initiative measure will be placed on the ballot in March, 1990, 
to limit the refinery's use of hydrofluoric acid, an acutely toxic substance 
used to boost the octane of unleaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours before the July 15 explosion, an unrelated explosion and flash 
fire injured eight contractor workers, two seriously, in another part of the 
plant. Investigators pegged the cause of that accident to a welding torch that 
ignited fumes in a water treatment area. 
</P>
<P>
In their report on the July 15 accident, city fire investigators faulted Mobil 
for failing to train refinery workers in handling the substances used to clean 
tanks holding water contaminated with sulfur compounds. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that Mobil failed to establish and follow a 
hazardous-materials management plan. And investigators also said that Mobil had 
failed to inform employees of hazardous materials in their work area and that 
refinery officials did not follow their own safety procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The Mobil arraignment was set for Aug. 14 by Municipal Judge Thomas Sokolov. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Hugo Martin, James Rainey and Jeffrey L. Rabin contributed 
to this story.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO CHARGES ON PILOT WHO UPSTAGED B-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No criminal charges will be brought against Brian Green, the private pilot who 
upstaged the planned debut of the B-2 stealth bomber when he made an 
unauthorized landing Saturday at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Green made an innocent mistake, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no criminal intent," Cooley said. "He had a flight plan. He became 
disoriented." 
</P>
<P>
Green still could face possible suspension of his pilot's license or other 
administrative action by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Green, of Porterville in Tulare County, was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of 
criminal trespassing. Air Force Plant 42 was closed for the planned inaugural 
flight of the once super-secret B-2 when Green landed his Cessna 172 on a 
runway near the stealth bomber and a horde of security agents, military 
officials, reporters and camera crews. 
</P>
<P>
Green was headed from Porterville to Agua Dulce Airpark with his 9-year-old 
nephew and 8-year-old niece when he became lost and decided to land at the 
nearest airport. The Air Force control tower personnel were unable to reach him 
because he was on a different radio frequency.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE SEEK MURDER CHARGE IN CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police said Monday they will seek murder charges against a driver 
involved in a crash that killed one person and critically injured four others 
in northeast Los Angeles Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the driver, Harry Boubushian, 34, of Los Angeles, has two previous 
drunk driving convictions and completed an alcohol rehabilitation program only 
three days before the accident. Police said Monday that the dead person is 
believed to be Boubushian's wife. 
</P>
<P>
Boubushian was exceeding 100 m.p.h. as he drove west on Los Feliz Blvd. just 
before 11 p.m. with seven passengers in his 1988 BMW, police said. He lost 
control just west of Vermont Avenue, became airborne and hit two parked cars 
before landing, police said. All eight people were thrown from the car. 
</P>
<P>
The survivors were taken to six area hospitals. Two were on life-support 
systems Monday, two others remained in critical condition, one was treated for 
a broken leg, and one treated for bruises and released, police said. Boubushian 
was not seriously hurt.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FUNDS EARMARKED FOR ABUSED CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pasadena-based program that strives to keep abused children with their 
parents rather than placing them in foster homes will continue to operate for 
another year, thanks to additional funding included in the 1989-90 budget 
approved by Gov. George Deukmejian last week. 
</P>
<P>
Hillsides Home for Children is one of eight nonprofit agencies in California 
that will receive a total of $1.2 million during fiscal 1989-90 to hire 
professional therapists to make regular visits to the homes of abused children. 
The pilot programs were started in 1984, and preliminary reports show they are 
75% successful in keeping families together. 
</P>
<P>
Hillsides' In-Home Critical Care program treats 100 San Gabriel Valley families 
each year. Its staff includes four full-time therapists, one part-time social 
worker and one full-time project director. The program operates on a $200,000 
annual budget, 75% of which is provided by the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We were delighted because if the governor did not extend the projects they 
would have died out," said Steve Madison, president of the Board of Directors 
of the California Consortium of Child Abuse Councils, which lobbied the 
governor in support of the programs.

Ferruzzi Releases Letters: Ferruzzi S.p.A., the Italian agricultural giant that 
plans to sue the Chicago Board of Trade after being ordered to liquidate large 
positions in soybean futures, released letters of protest in support of its 
free-market stance from the grain buying agencies of the Soviet Union and 
China. Several independent traders and firms have privately come out in support 
of Ferruzzi in its dispute with the Board of Trade's directors after they voted 
last week to force holders of July soybean contracts to liquidate those 
positions to prevent a possible default. The exchange's order drove the price 
of the July contract down sharply, prompting Ferruzzi to promise a lawsuit to 
recover the losses.

Relatives Triple Cummins Holdings: Cummins Engine Co. said relatives of the 
company's founders bought more than 1 million Cummins shares from Hanson USA 
for $72 million, nearly tripling their investment. J. Irwin Miller and his 
sister, Clementine M. Tangeman, bought 1,043,000 shares of Cummins from the 
U.S. unit of Hanson PLC and exchanged the shares for $67 million of new Cummins 
notes. At the same time, Miller, his wife, Xenia, and Tangeman exchanged their 
remaining 580,269 Cummins shares for new Cummins preferred stock, valued at $37 
million. Earlier this month, Britain's Hanson PLC said it agreed to buy 
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC for about $5.5 billion.

Texas Air Negotiating for Boeing Jets: Texas Air Corp. is reportedly 
negotiating to purchase a package of Boeing 737-300 jets worth as much as $2.8 
billion, with some delivery dates as early as 1991, airline analysts said. The 
Houston-based parent company of Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines 
confirmed that it has been talking to aircraft vendors, but declined to discuss 
any negotiations. The narrow-body Boeing jets would primarily serve 
Houston-based Continental. Unlike nearly all other major U.S. airlines, 
Continental has no new planes on order, posing potential problems should noise 
limits on older jets restrict the airline's operations in the 1990s.

Ford Expands Sales Incentives: Ford Motor Co. notified its dealers that it is 
adding $1,000 rebate offers on two full-sized cars until further notice in 
attempts to spur their slowing sales and curb growing inventories. The rebates 
on its Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis sedans and wagons are the first 
buyer incentives placed on those cars since 1983, and underscore the softening 
sales so far this year in the large-car market, as well as the entire industry. 
Ford also announced a $750 rebate until further notice on its full-sized Bronco 
sport utility vehicle, adding it to current incentive offers on a wide range of 
light truck models that also expire July 31.

State Sen. Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) joined a coalition of crime victims' 
groups Monday to formally launch a petition drive to place a criminal-justice 
initiative on the ballot next June. The initiative, derived from Royce's 
unsuccessful attempts to change the court system through the Legislature, would 
change trial procedures to speed criminal trials and would seek to ensure that 
death sentences are carried out without unnecessary delays. Royce said that if 
voters are given the chance, "I have no doubt that the will of the people for 
judicial reform, tougher sentences, an effective death penalty and equal 
treatment for the victims of crime will prevail." The measure is being 
sponsored by the Crime Victims' California Justice Committee, which has until 
Nov. 6 to gather the 600,000 signatures necessary to qualify the initiative on 
the June, 1990, ballot.

BREN TO GIVE UCI $1 MILLION MORE FOR FELLOWS PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L.Bren will donate $1 million to a UC Irvine 
endowment bearing his name during a press conference today, and distinguished 
evolutionary biologist Francisco Ayala will be named director of the Bren 
Fellows Program and its first fellow. 
</P>
<P>
"I will continue my research and be an active director," said Ayala, a member 
of the National Academy of Sciences, in confirming his new position Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Created With Bren Gift 
</P>
<P>
The Bren Fellows program was created last year with a $1.5-million gift from 
Bren, the multimillionaire executive of the largest landholding entity in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
A key to the endowment was an agreement with the Irvine Co. that removed a deed 
restriction that had prevented UCI from commercially developing campus property 
since 1960, when the company sold the land to UCI. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for a 135-acre, high-tech research park on the property were announced in 
May; under terms of the agreement, all lease revenues will be used for more 
fellowships and to pay for research and teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Bren's latest gift will endow a second fellowship and be used to attract a top 
scholar to UCI, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Bren, who said last year that his earlier endowment would "place UCI in a 
position of tremendous and virtually unparalleled academic strength," could not 
be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, who will participate in the announcement 
today, would not comment Monday on the planned gift. 
</P>
<P>
Peltason has described the planned research park as an important element of the 
university's future as "a knowledge center." UCI, which will gain up to 2 
million square feet of commercial space in the research park areas, expects to 
lure biomedical companies that would conduct research in partnership with 
scientists from UCI's College of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The research park, in effect, will place UCI in competition with the Irvine Co. 
for high-rent industrial tenants. The development firm owns much of the 
property surrounding UCI, including some of the most commercially valuable land 
in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala, a former Roman Catholic priest who left the church to study genetics, 
has the contacts and credentials to recruit leading scientists and scholars in 
his new position. 
</P>
<P>
Since he was lured from UC Davis in 1987, Ayala has researched the genetic 
causes of disease while aiding in UCI fund-raising. At a February meeting of 
the UCI Foundation Board of Overseers, composed of some of the university's 
most generous patrons, Ayala spoke briefly about his work and the need for 
continued research money. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala, 56, also organized the National Academy of Science's first West Coast 
symposium in May, 1988, joining a lofty program of lecturers on biological 
research and human values. 
</P>
<P>
He has often battled creationists in his 24-year academic career and was a 
major witness in a 1982 trial that resulted in the overturning of an Arkansas 
law requiring public school instructors to give equal time to the teaching of 
creationism and evolution.

CITY COUNCIL HEARS DEBATE ON MOVING CENTER FOR NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future of a nonprofit group that works to feed the hungry in Costa Mesa 
remained in question Monday night as the City Council listened to hours of 
testimony from an emotional, standing-room-only crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of other people waited impatiently outside the council chambers. Some 
wore yellow ribbons on their lapels to indicate their support for relocating 
SOS (Share Our Selves), while others wore red paper hearts, showing that they 
favored letting the organization remain at the Rea Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the council should renew the group's lease at the center or 
relocate it. Some residents have complained about problems in the neighborhood, 
but SOS boosters argue that the location is ideal. 
</P>
<P>
The debate didn't begin until two hours after the council meeting began, and 
then the hall was so crowded that dozens of people had to stand outside and 
watch the session on a cable television monitor. 
</P>
<P>
SOS founder Jean Forbath told the council that relocating the group from its 
home at Rea Community Center would be detrimental. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the right place," Forbath said. "Not renewing the lease would do 
more harm than good." 
</P>
<P>
But residents such as Campbell Davidson complain that SOS attracts vagrants and 
transients who rummage through the trash. 
</P>
<P>
"We're losing our neighborhood," he said before the meeting as he passed out 
yellow ribbons. "I'm not against SOS. But something needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Peter F. Buffa told the council that the issue was not whether the center 
was worthwhile but whether it could be moved. 
</P>
<P>
If SOS is forced to leave its 19-year home at the community center, Forbath has 
contended, it probably would mark the end of its programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We could not afford the rent or meet other restrictions we would encounter if 
we tried to move to another location," Forbath said before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The organization has been serving the county's poor since 1971 by offering 
food, clothes, free medical care and other aid. Last year, it spent about 
$600,000, most of it from private donations. 
</P>
<P>
She said SOS serves about 6,000 to 7,500 people a month, most of whom are Costa 
Mesa residents. The community center at 661 Hamilton St. is a prime location, 
she said, adding that two-thirds of the people served by SOS live within 
walking distance of the Rea center. Scott Mather, chairman of the SOS board of 
directors, said at one point that "the important issue is that SOS is in the 
neighborhood where the greatest number of clients are." 
</P>
<P>
The number of people served by SOS is in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Dolan, of the Mesa West Homeowners Assn., said the clients pose a threat to 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not what you want in a residential neighborhood," Dolan said.

SECURITY FIRM RELEASED FROM POLL GUARD SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Monday agreed to release a private security firm from a lawsuit 
after it promised to pay $60,000 to six voters who claim they were intimidated 
when the Orange County Republican Party placed guards at the polls in last 
November's election. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, Saddleback Security Services Corp., had provided GOP officials with 
20 uniformed guards on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Purcell, attorney for the voters, said they agreed to spend $24,000 of 
the money on legal fees to continue the case and $24,000 on voter education and 
voter registration programs. She said the remaining $12,000 was to be split 
among the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts' settlement approval came amid strong 
objections from other defendants, who claimed the security firm should be held 
accountable for at least some of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that they 
will have to pay in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback is "obviously . . . trying to protect itself from the parties it is 
really liable to," said Daniel Livingston, attorney for one of the remaining 
defendants, of which there are about a dozen, including the state and local GOP 
party organizations and their leaders. 
</P>
<P>
David A. Robinson, an attorney for another defendant, agreed and argued that 
the judge might ultimately determine that, but for the acts of the security 
guards, there was nothing that would have caused the voters to sue. 
</P>
<P>
But Letts was not swayed by their arguments, sticking to a tentative decision 
he made six weeks ago to allow Saddleback to settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
While making the ruling, however, Letts said that the lawyers' fees building up 
in the case were of "serious concern" to him. One defendant alone -- the state 
Republican Party -- has already run up fees that are twice the amount of the 
settlement, he noted. While not directly referring to the state party, Letts 
said he "would not like to think" that any of the defendants were engaging in 
"a wear-out tactic" against the voters who filed the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the guards, who were carrying signs in Spanish warning 
non-citizens not to vote, intimidated first-time Latino voters and may have 
frightened them away from the polls on Nov. 8. It seeks damages for the 
plaintiffs and also to overturn the narrow victory of Assemblyman Curt Pringle 
(R-Garden Grove) in the 72nd Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Responding to Rumors 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Republican Party officials, who paid $4,000 to hire the guards at 
the request of Pringle's political consultant, have said they were responding 
to rumors that Democrats planned to bus in illegal voters to tip the election 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Letts said he was allowing Saddleback to settle with the plaintiffs because if 
the case were not political it "would never have been worth more than the 
amount being paid right now." He said the firm would in effect be unfairly 
punished if required to stay in a drawn-out, politically charged case in the 
face of escalating legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other defendants have contended that the guards went beyond their 
instructions by approaching and questioning some voters. 
</P>
<P>
"The political issues have to do with intent and why the security firm was 
there in the first place, not really so much what they (the guards) did 
contrary to their instructions," Letts said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who is acting as Pringle's attorney, complained that the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission recently made it more difficult for his client 
to pay his legal bills by putting a limit on the amount of contributions he can 
receive from supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Currently, the plaintiffs are cash-heavy and we're penniless," Robinson told 
Letts. 
</P>
<P>
But the argument backfired on Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"It suggests to me what I already knew to be true, that the major issues here 
are political," Letts said. "We have a political fight being waged in the 
judicial arena."

NIXON LIBRARY TO GET INCOME FROM NEW BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace Foundation will receive the income 
from former President Nixon's new book, foundation officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The book, as yet untitled and written for Simon &amp; Schuster, will be Nixon's 
eighth and is scheduled for publication next spring. The dollar value of the 
contract was not disclosed. Previous Nixon books -- "Six Crises," "The Real 
War," "No More Vietnam" and last year's "1999: Victory Without War" -- were on 
the New York Times' best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the new contract, all seven of Nixon's previous books will be 
reissued by Simon &amp; Schuster in uniform "Nixon Library and Birthplace" 
editions, foundation Executive Director Hugh Hewitt said. Their release is 
scheduled to coincide with the opening of the facility in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps even more important than the books is President Nixon's leadership 
contribution to the library construction," Hewitt said. "It has made our final 
fund-raising sprint much more achievable." 
</P>
<P>
The new book contains firsthand accounts of Nixon's meetings with Charles de 
Gaulle, Winston Churchill, Mao Zedong and former Presidents Dwight D. 
Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"The book contains reflections and conclusions based on my entire life from 
private, political, foreign policy and philosophical standpoints," Nixon said. 
"It is the most personal book I have ever written." 
</P>
<P>
The Nixon library and birthplace are to be the first facilities of their kind 
built and operated without tax funds, according to foundation President William 
E. Simon. Nixon's contribution from book sales will assist in the $25-million 
fund-raising goal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Yorba Linda farmhouse where Nixon was born on Jan. 9, 1913, is undergoing 
restoration and will be part of a nine-acre facility under construction.

MAN HELD IN MOTEL FIRE AND ATTACK ON TOURIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police have a jailed a man they said set fire to his motel room, climbed out a 
window, then attacked a tourist standing nearby, slashing him with a beer 
bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Officers identified the suspect as Stephen P. McAlister, 25, who had been 
living in the room at the Gaslite Motel on Beach Boulevard. They said that 
Sunday night McAlister set a fire on or near his bed and after leaving the room 
attacked Leonard Morrison, 59, who was vacationing from Philadelphia. They said 
there appeared to be no motive for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison needed 26 stitches on his forehead, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrested McAlister without incident as he walked along Beach 
Boulevard, police said. He was was being held at Orange County Jail in lieu of 
$25,000 bail on suspicion of arson and assault with a deadly weapon, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was quickly extinguished but caused $15,000 damage to the room and its 
contents, police said.

UNION PICKETS COLLEGE TRUSTEES' MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Custodians, clerical workers and other members of the California School 
Employee Assn. picketed the Saddleback Community College District Board meeting 
Monday night to protest their lack of a contract. 
</P>
<P>
Union members, who include 380 employees at the district's two colleges, also 
planned to present a petition seeking higher wages and implementation of a new 
job classification plan to district trustees, said Tamara Carnine, chief 
negotiator for the workers. The employees, who have been without a contract 
since June 30, are seeking a pay increase of 4% to 7% and implementation of the 
job classification plan, which will include raises for many workers, 
retroactive to July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"They have offered increases but not fair and equitable increases," Carnine 
said. "The reclassification plan is being held hostage." 
</P>
<P>
District Chancellor Richard Sneed said he was surprised by the union's action, 
since a mediator assisting in contract talks had "suggested to us we were very 
close together." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Jenson, head negotiator for the district, said the union workers have 
been offered a 4.7% cost of living increase retroactive to last July. In 
addition, she said, the district has agreed to implement the job 
reclassification retroactive to the same time, but she said union officials may 
object to the method the district proposes to use to determine resulting 
raises. 
</P>
<P>
The district is made up of Saddleback College in Mission Viejo and Irvine 
Valley College in Irvine.

QUAYLE SEES 'BRIGHT FUTURE' FOR AEROSPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle, touring an Orange County laboratory where scientists 
simulate conditions in space, criticized on Monday a loss of national zeal 
toward space exploration but assured aerospace workers that their industry 
"does indeed have a very bright future." 
</P>
<P>
After getting a firsthand look at the "zero-gravity" lab at the McDonnell 
Douglas aerospace plant in Huntington Beach, Quayle spoke briefly to employees 
and school-age visitors as part of a four-day tour around the state. His wife, 
Marilyn, also took part in a mock disaster drill in Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
The focus on space during the vice president's visit came three days before the 
20th anniversary of astronaut Neil Armstrong's historic moonwalk and formed a 
prelude to what is expected to be a major policy statement on the issue by 
President Bush later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of employees at McDonnell Douglas jammed the plant's courtyard to 
catch a glimpse of the vice president. Many were hoping that he "might give us 
some insight into what the future holds for us" at a time when federal funding 
for space programs has appeared uncertain, said Troy Richardson of Garden 
Grove, a procurement worker who attended the talk. 
</P>
<P>
But Quayle, chairman of the newly re-established National Space Council, which 
advises the Administration on space policy, shied away from discussing specific 
programs and directions. He did, however, make clear that the Bush 
Administration "is committed to a vigorous and energetic space program for 
America." 
</P>
<P>
Suggesting several times that past policies in space have fallen short, he said 
the Administration intends to see that the United States "gets back into the 
space business." 
</P>
<P>
At a talk earlier in the day in Long Beach before the Western Governors' Assn., 
Quayle expanded on his criticism of past policies, saying the government's lack 
of financial commitment and direction in the space program has created a 
"dramatic decline" in the numbers of aerospace scientists, engineers and others 
in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing later to the hundreds of "future scientists" from local schools and 
youth groups who heard him talk at the McDonnell Douglas plant in Huntington 
Beach, Quayle said the presence of the children marked "a very good sign that 
the space program is on its way to recovery." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Olin of Laguna Niguel, who brought her Girl Scout troop to hear the 
vice president, said: "It was absolutely thrilling for all of them, an 
opportunity to be so close to someone of such national importance." 
</P>
<P>
Excited schoolchildren from the summer program at Sowers Middle School in 
Huntington Beach shouted, "I shook his hand! I shook his hand!" after the 
appearance. But several in the group, professing no interest in space, said 
they were disappointed that Quayle had not told them much about what it was 
like to be vice president of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle also faced an occasionally tough audience at a morning breakfast with 
reporters in Los Angeles. Asked about his apparent penchant for verbal gaffes, 
Quayle blushed deeply, fiddled with his coffee cup and said: "Well, everybody 
can make a mistake. . . . If that's the worst thing I do in the next six 
months, then the first six months will be in pretty good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier this week about the anniversary of the moonwalk, Quayle 
mistakenly referred to former astronaut Buzz Aldrin of Laguna Beach as "Buzz 
Lukens." Donald E. (Buz) Lukens was the Ohio Republican congressman who was 
recently convicted of having sex with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
And in a recent talk to the United Negro College Fund, he said, "What a waste 
it is to lose one's mind," a confusion of the group's slogan, "A mind is a 
terrible thing to waste." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the slip-ups, Quayle told reporters that he is winning over those who 
doubted his abilities to handle the vice presidency and has learned to trust 
his own judgment after a draining political campaign that made him the target 
of intense criticism over his National Guard service and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of skeptics during the campaign about how I would work out, 
but now they're seeing it work out in a very normal, comfortable way," he said. 
"I think I'm being reviewed well as vice president because people see how I am 
performing -- the responsibility I have, the working relationship I have with 
the President." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "When you go through that kind of day-in and day-out barrage, you 
really have to dig down deep inside and ask yourself what you're made of. 'Do 
you have it?' . . . When you looked at yourself in the mirror in the morning 
you had to realize that what had gotten you to the place you are is yourself. 
And the one critical mistake that I made was to rely on the advice of others. 
If I had it to do over again, I'd do it differently." 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday morning, Marilyn Quayle trumpeted one of her own special causes 
during a visit in the county. At the Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center, 
she got a demonstration of an Orange County-based program that trains 
volunteers to respond to emergencies and disasters nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The local program of the National Disaster Medical System, run jointly by 
various federal agencies in conjunction with the local chapter of the Red 
Cross, is one of only a half-dozen like it in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Quayle, an advocate of greater emergency preparedness, asserted the 
need for greater coordination and attention to the program but backed away from 
the issue of direct federal funding. "Just don't ask me for money," she joked 
to the group of volunteers who attended the visit.

PACHYDERMS ON PARADE

<P>
Despite temperatures in the 90s, hundreds of people gathered Monday afternoon 
to catch a glimpse of elephants, lions and tigers marching on the Anaheim 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
The unlikely parade down Lewis Street and Katella Avenue marked the arrival 
Monday of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey circus, which will perform 
at the convention center today through next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The circus's show animals were led from rail cars to the convention center by 
famed animal trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams, who will retire from the ring at 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach residents Gina and Donald Davis brought their three children for a 
glimpse of the show animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We know they are coming to Long Beach . . . but we couldn't wait," said Gina 
Davis. The animals and performers travel by train to each of the 39 cities 
where the circus performs, spokeswoman Ashley Anderson said. After the animals 
are unloaded, they are marched through each city to the circus show grounds. 
Justin Rhea arrived an hour early Monday to guarantee a good spot for his 
annual viewing. 
</P>
<P>
"I never miss it, not even when I am ill," said the 81-year-old retired 
salesman from Anaheim. ALLISON SAMUELS

KRAFT DEFENSE OFF TO SHAKY START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense lawyers in the Randy Steven Kraft murder trial, beset by problems 
organizing their witnesses, got off to a rocky start in the death penalty 
hearing Monday when a morning witness failed to show up. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's lawyers had unexpectedly called Bryce Wilson, a friend of two Buena 
Park men who were among the 16 victims in the 44-year-old computer consultant's 
first-degree murder conviction two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson, who has already testified twice in the Kraft case, failed to 
appear. Wilson had testified he was with the two men the night they disappeared 
in 1983. Their bodies were found later that weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft attorney James G. Merwin declined to say why he wanted jurors to hear 
from Wilson again. "But it would have been interesting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kraft lawyers began their penalty-phase defense without making an opening 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only 2 Verdicts Possible 
</P>
<P>
Jurors in Kraft's Santa Ana trial must choose between only two possible 
verdicts in the penalty phase: death in the gas chamber or life without parole. 
Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin would have the right to reduce the 
jury's death verdict, but no judge has done that since capital punishment was 
reinstated in California in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Kraft may be the most prolific killer in U.S. history. While 
the jurors have seen evidence of 24 murders linked to him -- the 16 in the 
guilt phase plus six in Oregon and two in Michigan in the penalty phase -- 
prosecutors claim he could be responsible for nearly 70 murders altogether. 
</P>
<P>
They have named 45 specific victims, but they claim that a coded list found in 
Kraft's car is Kraft's own score card, and it would total nearly 70 victims. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's lawyers have not disclosed their plans for a defense. They will not say 
who the witnesses will be during the upcoming defense portion of the penalty 
hearing, nor whether Kraft -- who did not testify during the guilt phase -- 
plans to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses Monday included a former private-security-force owner who blamed one 
of the Oregon murders in 1982 on a "cruddy, greasy, dirty-looking person" who 
hung around the garbage dumps near Wilsonville, Ore., at the time the victim 
was killed. The witness, Robert P. Hayes, said he overheard the man telling 
acquaintances about bouncing a victim out of his truck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Portland Hawaii' 
</P>
<P>
However, the victim, 19-year-old Lance Taggs, is one of the prosecution's 
strongest cases in the penalty phase. The phrase "Portland Hawaii" was found on 
the Kraft list, and Taggs was wearing a Hawaiian shirt when found. Also, 
personal items belonging to Taggs -- a tote bag and a martial arts weapon -- 
were found at Kraft's house.

LERON ELLIS TO SEEK GOAL AT SYRACUSE; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER MATER DEI, KENTUCKY STAR PURSUES WINNING NCAA TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LeRon Ellis, a former University of Kentucky and Mater Dei High School 
basketball player, announced Monday that he will be transferring to Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Since leaving Kentucky May 22 in the wake of National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
sanctions against the school, Ellis had been considering Syracuse, UCLA and 
Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
After visiting UCLA earlier this month, Ellis narrowed his choices to UCLA and 
Syracuse, where his friend and former teammate Mike Hopkins plays. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis said Monday afternoon at Mater Dei that he picked Syracuse for the same 
reason he left Kentucky. He wanted a shot at winning an NCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
That would be impossible at Kentucky. Just days before Ellis left, the Wildcats 
were placed on three years probation by the NCAA, including a two-year ban on 
postseason play, for several violations. Among them was a charge that the 
father of Chris Mills, then a recruit from Fairfax High School, was sent $1,000 
by a Kentucky assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the sanctions, Ellis, a 6-foot-10 junior center who graduated from 
Mater Dei in 1987 and led the Monarchs to two Southern Section 5-A 
championships and one state title, will be eligible to play for Syracuse 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"I left Kentucky because one of my goals in playing college basketball was to 
win the NCAA title," said Ellis, who averaged 16 points and five rebounds a 
game last season. "With the sanctions put on Kentucky, I had to do something to 
give me the opportunity to achieve my goal." 
</P>
<P>
He joins a veteran team at Syracuse that includes senior forward Derrick 
Coleman, Billy Owens, who was one of the finest freshmen in the nation last 
season, and Stephen Thompson, a guard from Crenshaw High. 
</P>
<P>
"Syracuse has a legitimate shot at the NCAA title," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse was 30-8 and reached the Midwest Regional championship game before 
losing to Illinois last season. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Fine, a Syracuse assistant coach, told Associated Press that Ellis "is 
very talented and should come in and have an impact immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis said two other factors helped him choose Syracuse. First, he wants to 
change his major from marketing to communications. Syracuse has an excellent 
communications program. Ellis also likes the running style and the freedom 
Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim gives his players. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have fit in on either team," Ellis said of Syracuse and UCLA. "(UCLA) 
Coach (Jim) Harrick said I would play center and play outside on offense off 
and on." 
</P>
<P>
But Ellis said he likes Syracuse's more wide-open offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Syracuse has no center," he said. "Their style of play is good for me. The one 
thing I do well is run the court. It's going to help me build on the finer 
points of my game." 
</P>
<P>
He said leaving Kentucky was difficult, but it proved to be his only recourse. 
He said the players knew before last season started that the NCAA would impose 
sanctions on the program at some point and he had time to prepare for it. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know how big basketball is in Kentucky until you are a basketball 
player in Lexington," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Ellis will find out how big basketball is in Upstate New York.

NEC REPORTS $1.5-MILLION QUARTERLY LOSS AMID TROUBLES AT APPLIED LEARNING UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
National Education Corp., which has suffered a yearlong string of setbacks, 
including the loss of several key executives, displayed the results Monday as 
it reported a $1.5-million loss for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers were far worse than investors had expected and signaled that 
National Education has significant troubles at its largest subsidiary, Applied 
Learning International. 
</P>
<P>
National Education, the nation's largest provider of educational training 
services, earned $7.6 million in the second quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue in the quarter ending June 30 dropped 8% to $96.6 million from $105 
million. 
</P>
<P>
In its 1988 annual report, National Education said it believed that it was 
positioned for an excellent 1989, after record earnings of $46.1 million and 
what it termed a "successful" merger of several companies into Applied 
Learning. 
</P>
<P>
But so far 1989 has been anything but a stellar year. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Arthur, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., said last week that if 
the company didn't report a profit for the second quarter, it could indicate 
that there are substantial problems at National Education that might not be 
solved quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those problems seem to be rooted at Applied Learning, where National 
Education has had difficulties turning several recently acquired companies into 
a working unit. 
</P>
<P>
Purchasing the new companies was intended to give National Education dominance 
in the corporate training industry. Instead, it has given National Education a 
serious test of its abilities. 
</P>
<P>
The company, for years a successful and fast-growing operator of vocational 
schools and home-study programs, has expanded out of its area of expertise in 
traditional consumer markets and into far-different and highly specific markets 
for corporate training. 
</P>
<P>
Some current and former National Education officials said the troubles of the 
past year have caused dissension throughout the firm, morale problems and an 
increasing wave of criticism about the management of Chairman H. David Bright. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard W. Jaffe, who heads the executive committee of National Education's 
board of directors, said the last several months have been the most unsettled 
for the company since he joined the board in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably been the most trying period for us," said Jaffe, a management 
consultant and private investor. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the setbacks occurred in September, when William Roach, president 
of National Education's Applied Learning subsidiary, unexpectedly announced his 
resignation following what observers said was a bitter clash with Bright, who 
declined to be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the integration of three acquisitions into Applied Learning has 
suffered from data-processing foul-ups, a poorly structured sales staff and the 
resignations of key employees, company officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Verbal Commitment 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said that many of Applied Learning's problems -- it is 
responsible for most of the loss reported for National Education's second 
quarter -- could have been avoided if Roach had been persuaded to stay until a 
successor could be found. Roach had been chief executive of Advanced Systems, a 
consulting services firm acquired by National Education in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
One National Education official who asked not to be identified said the merger 
with Spectrum International was made with a verbal commitment from National 
Education that every effort would be made to keep Roach. 
</P>
<P>
When Roach left, Jaffe said, the company tried "desperately" to find a 
successor by the first of this year, but two people turned down offers before 
Kenneth Riedlinger, a former General Motors executive, was hired in May. In the 
interim, Bright, who has been chief executive of National Education since 1981, 
took over the management of Applied Learning. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said the added responsibility forced Bright to turn his attention away 
from National Education and toward a subsidiary that he had no experience in 
running. Jaffe said National Education has been successful in the past because 
its parent company serves as a support group for subsidiaries that are run by 
very strong presidents. 
</P>
<P>
"David didn't want to be running Applied Learning," Jaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
Bright's time was stretched even thinner in March, when National Education 
President Jerome W. Cwiertnia resigned, saying he wanted to be with a firm 
where he could be chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Cwiertnia, who was considered to have been particularly helpful to National 
Education as a lobbyist on Wall Street and in Congress, has been persuaded to 
remain with the company as a consultant. One corporate insider said National 
Education is searching for a new president. 
</P>
<P>
Even in National Education's area of expertise, its vocational schools, the 
company has been troubled throughout this year. Enrollments have been flat for 
most of the year, and the company has had to increase its marketing budget to 
attract students. 
</P>
<P>
National Education's vocational schools suffered a blow in June when the 
government reported that default rates on student loans were exceptionally high 
at some of the firm's campuses. Several of the schools could face punitive 
actions -- including the loss of government-insured student loan programs -- if 
their default rates aren't improved. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the company's overall problems prompted Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. to 
announce that it is considering a downgrade of the rating on National 
Education's debt. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Monday's reported loss, industry analysts said a downgrade now 
is likely. 
</P>
<P>
The company's overall performance has led to an erosion of National Education's 
market value, from nearly $100 million a year ago to about $55 million at the 
close of trading Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect the second-quarter loss to translate into a sizable drop in 
stock prices when trading opens Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
National Education stock reached a high of $29 per share last year before 
starting its decline. Monday it closed at $16.75 per share, up 37.5 cents per 
share in New York Stock Exchange trading. But the second-quarter loss was 
disclosed after the stock market closed. 
</P>
<P>
The yearlong decline in the stock's price has angered investors. 
</P>
<P>
In June, a shareholder filed suit against the company charging Bright and other 
managers of attempting to manipulate the price of the company's stock by 
issuing false reports about earnings prospects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Communication Problems' 
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that management has had communication problems with its 
shareholders. It's unfortunate that all shareholders were hurt and not just the 
ones in the class action," said Debbie Laudermilk, a portfolio manager for the 
Texas Teacher Retirement Fund, which owns nearly 50,000 shares of National 
Education stock out of 31.9 million shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the allegations in the suit, Laudermilk said it is unclear 
whether current management didn't understand the extent of its problems or if 
management did not release as much information as it should have. 
</P>
<P>
She and other analysts said they remain optimistic about the company's 
long-term prospects, saying the firm owns valuable businesses, including its 
vocational education schools and study-at-home programs. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts say they have yet to be convinced that National Education 
will be successful in the corporate training business of its Applied Learning 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Success in the corporate training field requires development of highly 
specialized products, rather than the standardized courses offered by most 
vocational schools. Also, corporate programs are marketed to select company 
executives who determine the training for employees at all levels within the 
company. In contrast, vocational schools and home-study programs are marketed 
to a huge pool of individuals looking to develop basic skills, often for the 
purpose of getting a better job. 
</P>
<P>
Applied Learning President Riedlinger is praised by Jaffe and others in the 
company for working to fix the subsidiary's problems. One National Education 
official said several highly paid consultants have been hired to identify and 
help resolve the troubles. Meanwhile, Bright continues to make almost weekly 
trips to Applied Learning's headquarters in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said it is still too early to determine the extent of Applied 
Learning's woes, maintaining that even company officials don't know the 
severity of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Education's setbacks may be hurting the company's attempts 
to revive its flagging finances. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement Monday, Bright said Applied Learning's revenue was 
lower than anticipated in early June in particular because several potentially 
major contracts weren't signed. He did not say whether the pacts were canceled 
or merely delayed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, National Education reportedly has been attempting for several 
weeks to acquire a $50-million home-study business from McGraw-Hill, but 
reduced income, the depressed stock price and the uncertain future of National 
Education's credit rating all raise questions about its ability to finance the 
deal, industry analysts said.

BRIEFCASE: CODERCARD GOVERNMENT DIVISION CHIEF FIRED 1 WEEK AFTER BOSTON DEAL 
FAILS 
</P>

<P>
Codercard Inc. said Monday that it has fired the head of its federal government 
business operations because of "irreconcilable differences." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana developer of computer security systems said that Robert J. Gray 
was fired Friday and that no permanent successor has been named. 
</P>
<P>
Willis Marsing, Codercard vice president and manager of operations, will 
temporarily assume Gray's duties. 
</P>
<P>
When contacted Monday, Marsing declined to provide further details about Gray's 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
Gray joined Codercard in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The company is searching "for a qualified manager with experience in computer 
security (who) will be acceptable to our management as well as our customers 
within the federal government," Marsing said. 
</P>
<P>
Gray's firing followed Codercard's announcement Wednesday that its discussions 
with a Boston venture-capital company, concerning a $3-million financing 
package, have fallen through. The Bank House Exchange suspended talks with 
Codercard because its corporate and marketing structures did not meet the 
Boston firm's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Marsing declined to comment on whether the financing problems and Gray's 
departure are related. 
</P>
<P>
Codercard has developed and is trying to market a computer security device that 
uses a plastic card with an embedded microchip that prevents unauthorized users 
from gaining access to computers. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana firm has been concentrating on selling its device to the federal 
government but has so far been unable to land any government contracts. DAVID

SALE OF PIONEER S&amp;L TO DEVELOPER WERTIN IS DEAD, STATE AGENCY REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposed sale of Pioneer Savings &amp; Loan in Newport Beach to Irvine 
developer John E. Wertin has died. 
</P>
<P>
Wertin, who bought a recovering Bank of San Clemente in late 1987, had been 
negotiating for the purchase of Pioneer since September. He gave up on July 3, 
according to a recent notice from the state Department of Savings and Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Wertin nor James F. Deane, Pioneer's chairman, could be reached to 
explain why the deal fell through. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer, which hasn't had a profitable year since it opened in 1985, has seen 
its initial capital outlay of $2 million dwindle to $572,000 by the end of 
March. The S&amp;L's assets have similarly dropped to $15.1 million from a high 
of $22.2 million in December, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Wertin's $1.5-million cash deal would have helped to end a bitter dispute over 
ownership of the S&amp;L. Two years ago, the Hammond Co., a Newport Beach 
mortgage-banking operation, scuttled a tentative $2-million deal to buy Pioneer 
because of uncertainty over who owned the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Findley, a financial-institutions consultants in Brea, said the sale of 
Pioneer is hampered by a general uncertainty about the tattered S&amp;L 
industry. Congress is working on an S&amp;L rescue bill that would drastically 
increase requirements for capital -- an institution's final reserve against 
losses -- and would subject S&amp;Ls to examinations by banking regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the regulations are coming down is not going to make the thrift 
business profitable to be in," Findley said. 
</P>
<P>
Such flagging interest in the thrift business, along with Pioneer's ownership 
problems, doesn't make Pioneer an attractive purchase, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, eight investors were going to open Pioneer, according to a pending 
Orange County Superior Court lawsuit. Instead, the group decided to loan $1.8 
million to Deane in a complicated financing arrangement that allowed Deane to 
hold all the shares as sole owner. 
</P>
<P>
But by June, 1986, state and federal regulators saw that the $1.8 million 
wasn't being repaid and decided that Pioneer was, in fact, owned by eight 
individuals. The regulators required the other seven individuals to reveal 
their interests and to seek state approval to become S&amp;L owners. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, six of the seven other investors withdrew their applications for 
approval and, eight months later, sued Deane and the lawyers who arranged the 
original deal. The suit seeks to rescind the contract, alleging fraud.

ACTING TO BREAK CYCLE OF ABUSE; 
</P>
<P>
UPDATED 'WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS' TAKES AN ADULT LOOK AT MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1982, the Stop-Gap drama-therapy group's "When the Bough Breaks" took a look 
at victims of parental abuse, including sexual molestation. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual musical, the Santa Ana-based troupe's first original play produced 
for a community-wide audience, took its inspiration -- and the exact words of 
its songs -- from therapy sessions at the county's Albert Sitton Home, which 
then housed abused and abandoned children (it has since been replaced by the 
newer Orangewood Children's Home). 
</P>
<P>
Now, seven years later, "When the Bough Breaks" has been rewritten and retitled 
by local playwright John Weston (author of Stop-Gap's 1987 production, "Listen 
to the Dreaming"). "Shadow and Song," which opens Wednesday and runs through 
July 29 on South Coast Repertory's Second Stage, is still about the effects of 
sexual and physical abuse, but the focus has shifted. 
</P>
<P>
"It concentrates less on the child and more on the adult," said Christi 
Wilkins, special projects coordinator for Stop-Gap. Since "When the Bough 
Breaks" was first written, the lingering effects of childhood abuse on adults 
have been much studied and discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that one of four girls is sexually abused before the age of 18, 
Wilkins said, 87% of them by persons they know. One of seven boys has been 
abused by that age. "We're finding over and over in our workshops" about the 
long-term effects of those numbers, Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of abusers, she explained, were themselves abused as children. In 
addition, many abuse victims have difficulty as adults maintaining 
relationships. "Shadow and Song" tackles that problem but with a constructive 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
"What the play is doing is showing how you can use family and friends in a 
positive way," Wilkins said. "We're really excited about it because it's very 
uplifting." 
</P>
<P>
The play adopts the tactics of previous Stop-Gap productions about rape, 
terminal illness, AIDS and other issues not often addressed in community 
theater. "We use drama as a non-threatening and educational tool to help people 
empower themselves," Wilkins said. "It serves as a catalyst." 
</P>
<P>
Parents United, a peer support group for incest survivors, and VOICES, an 
acronym for Victims of Incest Can Emerge Successful, have bought out 
performances of "Shadow and Song" as fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are under way for a Los Angeles run of "Shadow and Song," which 
would make it the first major Stop-Gap production to be staged outside Orange 
County. The group already has opened a Los Angeles office and has taken its 
play on AIDS to South Bay schools. It has also started drama-therapy sessions 
at the Crittenton Center for Young Women and Infants in Los Angeles and 
recently received a $25,000 grant from the Ahmanson Foundation to create a 
program on drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
While Stop-Gap's success is gratifying, Wilkins said, "It's a sad tale when you 
think how many problems remain out there." The cycle of abuse continues, but 
with "Shadow and Song," Wilkins said, Stop-Gap hopes to "break some cycles and 
turn that bend around." 
</P>
<P>
 Stop-Gap's production of "Shadow and Song" plays Wednesdays through Saturdays 
at 8:30 p.m. through July 29 at South Coast Repertory's Second Stage, 650 Town 
Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets for Wednesday's preview are $12; tickets for 
remaining performances are $15. Information: (714) 648-0135.

A storage tank ruptured today and spilled an estimated 1.25 million gallons of 
crude oil, but the spill was stopped short of a waterway that leads to the 
Atlantic, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The oil was contained by a system of earthen dikes and was not expected to 
reach the outermost dikes, which are 15 feet from the water, Coast Guard 
spokesman Paul Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Tanker barges were sent to the scene on the shore of Arthur Kill, a narrow 
waterway separating New Jersey and the New York City borough of Staten Island. 
As a precaution, 900 feet of booms were lowered into the water. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what caused the rupture in the tank, which is 
owned by Northville Industries.

News agencies and sources in China today reported the arrests of a prominent 
U.S.-educated dissident and the country's best-known female journalist in the 
continuing crackdown on pro-democracy sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Shanghai arrested Yang Wei, a member of the New York-based dissident 
group "Chinese Alliance for Democracy," who was released from two years in 
prison last January. Yang was accused today of making propaganda speeches 
during the unrest that swept China from April to June. 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the country's most prominent female journalist was arrested after 
her apartment was searched for evidence of her role in the protests. Dai Qing, 
a writer for the official Guangming Daily, is one of the first targets in a 
crackdown on journalists.

The B-2 stealth bomber will be partially taken apart for inspection and 
analysis after its first successful test flight and should be ready to fly 
again within six weeks, the Pentagon said today. 
</P>
<P>
The $532-million, radar-evading bomber successfully completed its flight Monday 
over the Mojave Desert in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"What they will do now is the same thing they do on any test flight of an 
airplane; they will analyze the data," Defense Department spokesman Pete 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"They will also partially take the plane apart and give it a thorough 
inspection and give it additional electronics and avionics tests. They will do 
that inside the hangar before that particular plane flies again," Williams 
said.

<P>
A poker game in a Tujunga home was broken up when two gunmen rushed in, fired 
shots that injured two of the players, and then scooped $800 off the table, Los 
Angeles police said today. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made after the 8:30 p.m. Monday robbery in the 10200 block of 
Commerce Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bernard D. Conine said four men were playing poker at a table in the home 
when two gunmen entered at the same time through the back and front doors. They 
fired at least three shots and announced it was a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Conine said that Reynaldo Gallegos, 36, of Sunland was struck in the heel by a 
bullet and that Jorge Frutos, 32, of Sunland was struck in the thigh. A third 
player, Javier Diaz, whose age and hometown were not available, was slightly 
injured when he jumped through an open window. The fourth player, who was not 
identified, ran from the home uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
The two gunmen took the $800 in cash and escaped. Gallegos and Frutos were 
treated at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar and released.

Afghan government forces have abandoned the strategic garrison town of 
Samarkhel near the eastern city of Jalalabad, allowing it to fall back into the 
hands of U.S.-armed Muslim rebels, Western diplomatic sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
The report could not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic sources said Afghan government troops were forced to abandon 
Samarkhel soon after they captured it on June 7 because it was too vulnerable 
to strikes by guerrillas occupying adjacent high ground. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have suffered several recent military setbacks and failed to 
take major Afghan government targets despite the February pullout of all Soviet 
troops backing the Afghan army.

Bowing to a recent federal court ruling, the government today moved to revamp 
rules that have prevented 34,000 veterans from obtaining disability benefits 
for exposure to the defoliant "Agent Orange." 
</P>
<P>
Proposed new rules published for public comment would authorize the Veterans 
Affairs Department to award disability benefits when there was reasonable doubt 
as to whether a particular disease was statistically linked to exposure. 
</P>
<P>
The department set an Aug. 17 deadline for comments, and it said it would try 
to have final rules in place by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski ordered the new rules in May 
after a federal judge in San Francisco threw out the existing rules, concluding 
that they were too restrictive.

Kenya burned 12 tons of ivory worth more than $3 million today in a gesture 
symbolizing its commitment to protecting the African elephant. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya is leading a campaign for a global ban of the ivory trade, and the 
bonfire was a message to poachers of elephants that it considers the ivory 
market closed. 
</P>
<P>
President Daniel Arap Moi, who set alight the ivory in Nairobi's national park, 
branded the act as a historic effort aimed at preventing a "terrible 
environmental tragedy -- the extinction of Africa's elephant." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the ivory burned had been confiscated by the government from poachers, 
who have cut Kenya's elephant herd to 17,000 from more than 65,000 a decade 
ago.

The Greek government gave the New York lawyer of defeated Socialist Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou a $200,000 "golden handshake" today and dropped him 
from the state payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Leonard Boudin was handling Papandreou's libel suit against Time 
magazine and was in charge of efforts to extradite fugitive Greek banking 
tycoon George Koskotas, who is jailed pending extradition hearings in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Boudin filed charges against Time in Britain last April, saying the weekly news 
magazine libeled Papandreou in carrying an extensive interview with Koskotas. 
Koskotas accused the Papandreou government of approving a plan to pocket 
millions of dollars in interest payments from state accounts at the private 
Bank of Crete, which he controlled until fleeing in November.

SANTA FE RAILWAY CUTTING STAFF; 450 NON-UNION WORKERS AFFECTED

<P>
Santa Fe Railway announced today that it is cutting its staff by about 450 
people, from non-union clerical workers to upper-level management, as part of a 
plan to streamline operations. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to survive and prosper in today's transportation environment, it is 
necessary that we provide high-quality service at competitive prices. We must 
reduce our ongoing expenses if we are to accomplish that," Michael R. Haverty, 
company president, said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
Haverty said that nearly all of the reductions would be made through voluntary 
severance and early retirement, "although there will be a limited number of 
involuntary separations." 
</P>
<P>
All of the positions being eliminated are non-union jobs throughout the Santa 
Fe system, spokeswoman Susan Metcalf said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Railway is a subsidiary of Santa Fe Pacific Corp. It operates about 
11,500 miles of mainline freight trackage linking Chicago with California and 
about 10 other states, mostly in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
The railway's total employment was 19,633 at the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Metcalf said affected employees were given the option in June of leaving the 
company through a buyout or early retirement. In the following weeks, most 
picked one of those options, but several chose neither and were forced to quit, 
she said.

WIDENED TRADE DEFICIT SENDS DOW DOWN 8.73

<P>
Wall Street closed lower in quiet trading today, as weaker trade figures hurt 
stocks, bonds and the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 8.73 points to 2,544.76. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 7 to 5 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, with 618 up, 865 down and 519 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 152.35 million shares, against 131.96 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 0.46 to 184.91. 
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit widened 23.6% to $10.24 billion in May on a surge in imports. 
The strong demand raised concerns that the Federal Reserve may not be able to 
ease credit further, triggering a rise in credit market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
But stock market losses were small, with a recent rise in takeover activity 
lending support. The most actively traded stock was Marion Laboratories Inc., 
which agreed earlier in the day to be acquired by Dow Chemical Co. 
</P>
<P>
News of the jump in the trade deficit jolted the bond market this morning, 
depressing prices and pushing up short-term interest rates for the second 
straight day. 
</P>
<P>
A rising trade deficit signals faster economic growth and therefore higher 
inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income holdings such as bonds, and 
puts pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to constrict borrowing to slow the 
economy down. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond, which lost 1/2 point or $5 per $1,000 face 
amount Monday, fell another 1/2 point by late morning. Its yield, which moves 
inversely to price, rose to 8.17% from 8.12% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
fell about 3/16 point, intermediate maturities fell 5/16 point and long-term 
issues fell about 1/2 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 2.67 to 1,183.65. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial and utility corporate bonds also weakened. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures returns on a portfolio of 80 corporate 
bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.68 to 329.31. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.17% as the discount rose 5 basis 
points from the level at auction Monday to 7.91%. Yields on six-month bills 
rose to 8.16% as the discount rose 8 basis points from the level at auction 
Monday to 7.74%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.02% as the discount rose 5 
basis points to 7.48%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9 1/4%, unchanged from late Monday.

Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., the Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. brokerage unit, said 
today it no longer will handle computer program trading and criticized other 
stockbrokers who do. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the firm said Dean Witter pulled out of program trading because 
"it threatened the integrity of the market in customers' minds." 
</P>
<P>
Blamed by some as the cause of stock market volatility around the time of the 
1987 crash, program trading virtually disappeared for a time because of a 
self-imposed ban by Wall Street firms. But recently it has made a strong 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
But Dean Witter, which has never been a major participant in program trading, 
criticized the practice, saying "We are an honest broker and want to execute in 
the best interest of our customers. We don't think program trading did that."

A previously unknown Chinese organization has threatened to kill two Japanese 
each month from mid-August if Japan does not stop "its economic invasion of 
China," a Japanese Embassy spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The threat was contained in a letter delivered to the Beijing office of Japan 
Air Lines in the Jinglun Hotel on Monday and signed by an organization calling 
itself "Glory Through Blood Dare-to-Die Command." 
</P>
<P>
Groups of Chinese workers and students called themselves "dare-to-die" squads 
in early June when troops and tanks smashed through Beijing to crush 
demonstrations for democracy in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, a JAL head office spokesman quoted the letter as describing Japanese 
businessmen in China as "pirates" -- a reminder of the Japanese raiders along 
China's coasts 600 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese pirates in collusion with the Chinese Communist Party dictatorial 
government are planning a large-scale economic invasion," the letter said, 
quoted by the JAL spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The embassy in Beijing had warned some Japanese businessmen about the letter 
and contacted police and the Foreign Ministry to ask that the security of 
Japanese in Beijing be guaranteed, the embassy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
He quoted the letter as saying the threat applied to Japanese businessmen, 
tourists and those in official delegations. Diplomats and their families, 
journalists, teachers and students had their safety guaranteed.

Nationwide strikes by hundreds of thousands of employees today shut down the 
train system, the London subway, 37 ports and city libraries and day-care 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
The stoppages are part of a wave of union militancy confronting Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government as it tries to halt inflation 
topping 8%. The rail and subway strike is the fifth joint 24-hour stoppage in 
five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes were raised Monday that the rail strike could be averted when a second 
British Rail union accepted an 8.8% wage increase. However, the third and 
biggest union, the National Union of Railwaymen, rejected it late Monday night, 
holding out for a 10% raise for its 75,000 members.
