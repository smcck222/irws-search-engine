More from those friendly East-West skies: 
</P>
<P>
Air L.A., a local commuter airline, received a job application the other day 
from Aleksandr Alekseyevich Kaminin of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Kaminin, 39, said he's a qualified airline pilot and added that "my health is 
good absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the world is changing," said Air L.A. Vice President Bill Wolf, noting 
that Kaminin was his first Soviet job applicant. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf said that he "certainly seems qualified -- but I can't pay his way here 
for an interview." 
</P>
<P>
Kaminin attached a postscript to his letter: 
</P>
<P>
"Please use telex for communication since our post-office is not reliable." 
</P>
<P>
The world may be changing, but lawyers don't seem to be getting any more 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
Now some Florida attorneys and judges are griping about so-called "S.O.B. 
litigators" who display the same hard-ball tactics used by characters in the TV 
show "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
Robert E. Beach, a federal judge, said the nastiest lawyers seem to come out of 
the courthouse woodwork "the morning after 'L.A. Law."' 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Booth has a different complaint about his lawyer. He can't find him. 
</P>
<P>
Booth, a computer software designer, hired an attorney to handle his 
back-injury claim before moving from L.A. to Boston. He said he has since 
telephoned his lawyer more than 15 times without getting a reply. 
</P>
<P>
Booth complained to the L.A. County Bar Assn. and was told that someone would 
get back to him in about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"When I asked why I'd have to wait so long," Booth said, "I was told that it's 
because there are so many other complaints against lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
You may recall a recent Times article on the LAPD's Immediate Booking and 
Release Systems (IBARS), a program whereby officers book traffic violators at 
the scene. It's interesting to note that the mobile unit isn't a new concept, 
as the accompanying photo shows. Inglewood used one for several months in 1926. 
It was probably such a good idea that it was discontinued.

Some personnel at St. Mary Medical Center will wear eyeglasses that impair 
their vision today. Others will attempt to purchase items from a vending 
machine while wearing gardening gloves. And others will be asked to order food 
in a cafeteria line while sitting in a wheelchair.

<P>
It's all part of the Long Beach hospital's "Senior for a Day" program. Its 
purpose is "to point out some of the difficulties older adults face," said Dr. 
Timm Holt, a geriatrician. "It's important that we recognize and be sensitive 
to their special needs."

Warren Meyer calls himself the "Junk-Mail King." He says he wants to give 
something back to the community. So, his L.A.-based Meyer &amp; Son Mailhouse 
is offering to handle any charity's bulk-mail chores for free during the month 
of August. "He's giving the only way he knows how," explained publicist Mike 
Venema. "By junk mail."

GLENDALE GROUP WANTS STATE TO PROBE FIREFIGHTER PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of Glendale homeowner associations has asked the state to 
investigate whether a countywide force of firefighters responded efficiently to 
a hillside blaze that destroyed 46 homes and damaged 20 others in the city on 
June 27, a spokesman for the coalition said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Some activists have charged that many homes were lost in neighborhoods 
neglected by firefighters until well after the flames had spread. About 350 
firefighters from numerous departments battled the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Homeowners Coordinating Council, representing 15 homeowner 
associations, asked that Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, along with the state 
fire marshal's staff, "conduct a full investigation of all aspects of the fire, 
examining the many unanswered questions that have been raised in the manner in 
which this fire was fought." 
</P>
<P>
"We've just heard so many negative comments from people whose homes burned and 
who felt they weren't helped sufficiently," said Esther Bowen, president of the 
College Hills Community Assn., where more than 20 homes were destroyed or badly 
damaged by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Fire Chief John M. Montenero defended the efforts of firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of our department," he said. "Our business is very judgmental. 
Yes, there are probably ways in hindsight to do things better, but we don't 
know what they are yet." 
</P>
<P>
Montenero said his department's own investigation, to be completed in August, 
will be thorough and objective. He said he would be willing to share records 
with any outside agency. 
</P>
<P>
But the homeowners said they want an independent probe. 
</P>
<P>
Joe A. Bridges, a spokesman for the coalition, said the letter was mailed last 
weekend, with copies sent to Gov. George Deukmejian, State Fire Marshal James 
McMullen and the state legislators who represent the Glendale area. The group 
made the letter public Wednesday after Bridges had informed Glendale City 
Council members of its contents. 
</P>
<P>
One resident, Rob Sharkey, who is president of the Glenmore Canyon Homeowners 
Assn., said firetrucks did not arrive in his community of 200 homes until two 
hours after the blaze was reported. He said 14 of the destroyed homes were in 
Glenmore Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to know this hill was burning," he said Wednesday. "Why didn't they 
send even one truck? Even one truck could have saved some homes." 
</P>
<P>
Christiana Mullen, a spokeswoman for Van de Kamp, said the homeowners' letter 
had not been received in Sacramento by Wednesday. She said the office reviews 
all such requests, then determines whether an investigation is justified. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant State Fire Marshal Dave Walizer was also unfamiliar with the letter 
Wednesday, but he said his office has no authority to investigate local fire 
departments.

SO, JUST WHEN IS A RECESSION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress Wednesday that the Federal Reserve Board 
will cut interest rates at the first hint of a recession. The Fed, he said, is 
even prepared to drive interest rates down to overcome any drag on the economy 
from a combination of spending cuts and higher taxes required to make a major 
dent in the federal deficit. His testimony about lower interest was carefully 
couched, not in terms of recession but in terms of ways to deal with a 
reluctance of some banks to make loans, thus creating credit crunches. 
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, obligatory for Fed chairmen to deny they are talking about 
big changes in policy or that there is any sign of genuine trouble in the 
economy. Nothing anyone else in Washington can say or do makes Wall Street 
shiver like the flimsiest hint of pessimism from the Fed (especially true when 
the economy is hurting.) But the scene did raise a question that once seemed 
settled, even if arbitrarily: When is a recession? 
</P>
<P>
The unhesitating answer used to be that the country is in recession when its 
gross national product dips in two consecutive quarters. 
</P>
<P>
But back in the 1980s, workers driven from the so-called Rust Belt of the 
Midwest by massive layoffs in the automobile industry had a hard time believing 
that they were not in a recession because the rest of the country was doing 
fine. The same is true these days of workers watching hard times slip south 
from New England into New York and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The question is of more than academic interest in California, where defense 
cutbacks and construction layoffs in the housing industry prompted UCLA 
economists to recently warn that the state is being pushed to the brink of a 
recession. But no other forecasters take such a grim view of the economic 
future -- and California employment continues to rise and unemployment to fall, 
despite recent layoffs at major employers like McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible the old definition of pool-hall economists was right all along. 
When your neighbor's out of work, the economy is pausing to gather strength. A 
recession is when you're out of work.

S&amp;L WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
TOURIST ATTRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While he's in Orange County for the Nixon library opening, President Bush 
should look at a tourist attraction of the future. It's the $1.9-million gated 
estate in Newport Beach, with two Mercedes out front, where an S&amp;L figure 
who claimed he was broke now lives. 
</P>
<P>
Denver developer Bill L. Walters had been a business partner of the President's 
son, Neil, before defaulting on a $96-million real estate loan made by the 
failed Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. Neil Bush is in hot water 
over his role as a Silverado director, for allegedly violating 
conflict-of-interest regulations by voting to approve the loans to Walters. 
</P>
<P>
Walters last month testified before the House Banking Committee that he had "a 
negative net worth." He may be broke, but a trust in his wife's name bought the 
estate in February. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L crisis is a complex mosaic of poor government and business 
decisions, economic downturns -- and greed. The paper chase is tedious, but the 
public might be spared a bundle with more vigorous investigations now. 
</P>
<P>
With reasonable cause and due process, the government could initiate attachment 
proceedings on suspect properties. If an S&amp;L kingpin's wife proved 
independently wealthy, fine -- one less case to resolve. But lost time affords 
the real crooks more opportunities to hide assets. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents know all about symbols. This estate powerfully suggests the public's 
exasperation. Bush should see where a penniless man lives. It costs $800 to cut 
the lawn.

WELCOME SHIFT ON CAMBODIA; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. SUPPORT FOR RESISTANCE COALITION ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The announcement that the United States will open a dialogue with Vietnam over 
the war in Cambodia marks a major -- and decidedly welcome -- shift in U.S. 
policy towards Indochina. It effectively ends U.S. support for a Cambodian 
resistance coalition that included the bloody Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
By enlisting Hanoi's help, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said 
Washington hopes to end a decade of fighting in Cambodia and prevent the Khmer 
Rouge from returning to power. But he cautioned that the talks will be confined 
to Cambodia, and do not signal the normalization of relations between the 
United States and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The new approach, however, does suggest a new realism about Indochina, one 
driven less by ideology and more by pragmatism. It is a significant 
acknowledgement that it's time for the United States to move beyond the painful 
wounds left by the Vietnam War, especially now that Vietnam is being forced to 
change, too, as it receives less aid from the financially strapped Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's announcement, after conferring with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard 
Shevardnadze, came at the conclusion of talks in Paris. There, members of the 
United Nations Security Council met again to attempt to draft a cease-fire 
between Cambodia's rival factions and to provide an interim U.N. administration 
pending free elections. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has long shunned Cambodia's current Vietnam-backed Communist 
government of Prime Minister Hun Sen. It has insisted instead on supporting a 
coalition of non-Communist groups headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a former 
Cambodian ruler. The triumvirate, however, includes the Khmer Rouge, who were 
responsible for 1 million to 2 million deaths while they controlled Cambodia 
from 1975 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The result, at best, has been an uneasy alliance in which the Khmer Rouge has 
been the least cooperative member. Most recently, Khmer Rouge representatives 
refused to attend peace talks in Tokyo to discuss forming a multifaction 
council to organize a free election. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, even as the Paris talks began, the Khmer Rouge was threatening new 
attacks against the Hun Sen regime if its terms were not met. Baker said in 
Paris that Washington would no longer recognize control by resistance groups -- 
including the Khmer Rouge -- of Cambodia's U.N. seat. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's announcement comes as mixed signals on Cambodia and Vietnam are coming 
out of Washington. For example, a week after the House voted in June to 
continue aid to the non-Communist resistance groups in Cambodia, the Senate 
Intelligence Committee voted to cut off such aid. The contradictory positions 
are to be worked out later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The policy shift should mark the beginning of a consistent and compassionate 
Cambodia policy.

VOTER APATHY IN JUNE PRIMARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When are we ever going to mention the word "responsibility" when we discuss and 
relate all the data on the June 5 primary election? It isn't unusual, though, 
since we never hear about "responsibility" regarding any other facet of our 
lives and we will continue to have problems in our society, as long as 
"responsibility" is not the keyword in our lives! 
</P>
<P>
Men have fought and died so that we can participate in this beautiful voting 
privilege and yet there are always so many excuses! How sad! Voting is the 
easiest function we have to perform, since one can always vote by using the 
absentee ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Signing up for a race or college class takes more effort and time! We have got 
to do better. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Los Angeles County of the 3,402,509 registered voters, only 1,283,079 
voted and 177,295 voters did vote absentee by mail. Let's go, Los Angeles 
County -- let us all register and vote in the November election!

Airplanes grounded. The FBI prostrate. One million armed services personnel 
unleashed, unemployed, on innocent society. The pooh-bahs of the Bush 
Administration now are telling us, with straight faces, that the spending cuts 
mandated by Gramm-Rudman will yield nothing short of apocalypse; hence the need 
for the rest of us to send Washington more money. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, please. Can anyone possibly believe that a government about to spend more 
than $1.2 trillion (that's 11 zeros) has insufficient resources? Budget 
Director Richard Darman is playing the old game of publicizing potential 
reductions in the most defensible and needed programs, just as local officials 
always threaten to cut fire protection and trash collection instead of the 
ubiquitous subsidies for local interest groups. The cuts about which Darman has 
developed a new-found fear of God are those mandated by Gramm-Rudman, which 
exempts about half of all federal spending from automatic cuts, and subjects 
another quarter to automatic cuts that are only partial. 
</P>
<P>
But if a budget summit "with no preconditions" can address taxes and the 
Gramm-Rudman deadlines, why then can it not change the federal programs subject 
to automatic reduction? 
</P>
<P>
How about cutting out the farm subsidy programs, a source of enormous resource 
waste and environmental damage? That would save about $15 billion immediately. 
Now that the Soviet departure from Germany is a foregone conclusion, the new 
international climate allows us to move back toward the traditional U.S. 
peacetime posture of small standing armed forces. Let's be conservative; a 
personnel cut of only 20% would save another $16 billion. A 15% cut in defense 
investment would save about $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Well, thus far we've saved $51 billion. Don't worry: there's plenty more. The 
NASA space station is a boondoggle with no defined purpose other than provision 
of busy work for the space shuttles. Chalk up another $1 billion. A partial 
one-year freeze in Social Security spending would save about $10 billion. Most 
energy programs are little more than subsidies for expensive, wasteful projects 
in various congressional districts -- another $1 billion could be saved easily. 
And how about the Army Corps of Engineers? Should the taxpayers subsidize 
environmentally destructive water projects for various special interests? The 
question answers itself: We've just saved another $1 billion plus. 
</P>
<P>
This is fun: Just think of the party we could throw with the $64 billion that 
we've saved in just a few paragraphs. (A party, you see, would benefit society 
at large by keeping me out of my office, thus reducing the damage that I 
cause.) Shall we save another half-billion or so? Away with the Export-Import 
Bank, which is essentially a piggy bank for aircraft manufacturers. How about 
the Department of Education? It is, after all, little more than a central 
receiving station for the demands of the National Education Assn. and the other 
permanent special interests seeking a continued state of socialism in U.S. 
education. Various federal programs perpetuate this absurdity; eliminating them 
would improve educational quality and save at least $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Another $1 billion could come from deletion of mass-transit subsidies, which 
will not and cannot reduce either traffic congestion or pollution. A change of 
focus in the space program toward smaller, more useful and more manageable 
projects would save about $1 billion. The Small Business Administration is 
little more than a trough for various business interests with good political 
connections; another half-billion or so. More than $1 billion could be saved by 
slashing the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a bureaucracy with a noble 
name but a miserable track record and virtually no prospects for improvement. 
Get rid of the Postal Service and put mail delivery where it belongs, in the 
private sector; that's $3 billion. More than $1 billion could be saved by 
eliminating public housing programs -- one of the most perverse social policies 
ever conceived -- and replacing them with housing vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
We have a federal budget with almost 200,000 line items; for practical 
purposes, then, the list of candidates for contributions to our savings account 
is endless. There is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, already brimming with 600 
million barrels. There is the Rural Electrification Administration loan 
program; the Power Marketing Administration subsidies. Foreign aid subsidies. 
The Naval Petroleum Reserves. Ad infinitum. If the politicians tell you that 
they just cannot get along without more taxes, remind them that federal 
spending is larger than the GNP of every other nation on earth, except Japan 
and possibly the Soviet Union. Then throw the budget at them. Literally.

Does it make much sense to seat Japan at NATO's top table? Perhaps it is better 
to keep Tokyo cooling its heels in the hope that its foreign policy will grow 
more mature with the waiting. 
</P>
<P>
There is a case for a broader alliance coping with an enlarged democratic 
Europe -- and thus allowing Japan, the most illustrious "honorary" member of 
the West, to take a more active role. If one seriously fears that rising 
nationalism in Japan may make it a threat to the stability of East Asia, then 
participation in NATO might be a less dangerous distraction. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a real fear that new conflicts, such as the ones bound to develop 
in Central Asia, will draw in great powers from both ends of Eurasia, then 
Japan should get used to high-level NATO deliberations on "out of area" 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Yet from Europe it seems that Japan is overreacting to the new Europhoria, 
after years of sneering at Eurosclerosis. Japanese foreign policy is suffering 
yet another "shock" to its supercilious sense that it is the wave of the 
future. Much like Japan's failure to read the intention of the United States to 
normalize relations with China in the 1970s, Japanese foreign policy is 
notoriously slow at reacting to major shifts in the global balance of power. 
</P>
<P>
At least three major features of Japanese foreign relations need to show real 
signs of reform before a seat in NATO can even be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Japan needs to develop a more mature relationship with the Soviet Union. 
Tokyo's rhetoric is still that of the Cold War. Japan still seems obsessed by 
the need for Moscow to capitulate completely on the matter of the disputed 
Northern Territories. At a time when even China and South Korea have normalized 
relations with the Soviet Union, Japan must also accept the need to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Japan still has much to do in developing a more mature relationship with 
the United States. Progress in trade talks is only part of the story. The 
maturing process also needs to extend to military affairs. Precisely because 
there is no NATO in East Asia -- and it is pointless to create one -- Japan 
must come to terms with its own limitations as a military power. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is indefensible in the modern age and can be strangled in weeks by a 
blockade. Now that the Soviet threat is fading, it is far more worried, albeit 
quietly, about Chinese aspirations. Thus the United States is needed to keep 
local instabilities under control. Japan, meanwhile, can play a constructive 
role in encouraging regional arms control. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There is a great deal that Japan can do to normalize relations with the 
members of the European Community. Just as the United States has come to accept 
the need for regular talks about a range of economic and political issues with 
the European Community in Brussels, so Japan must take the community more 
seriously. As part of the "thickening" of Japan's relations with community 
states, there should also be far more discussion about cooperation in the 
defense sector, including cooperation on new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has earned the trust of Europeans by making sacrifices for 
European stability and prosperity. Japan has only recently become a major 
investor in Europe and there are far too few European leaders, like British 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who welcome Japan as a partner in building a 
new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Let Japan extend to the Europeans the same trade deals it hammers out with the 
United States. Let Japan, like the United States, funnel its aid to the 
emerging democracies of Eastern Europe through the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development. And if Japan is really serious about a role in 
European security, then let it drop the annoying talk of a Pacific Economic 
Community, or at least offer the European Community a seat at the table of its 
Pacific pretender.

Outbreaks of measles across the country this year have brought much-needed 
attention to the inadequacies of our nation's immunization efforts. I think 
most people would be surprised to learn that more than one-quarter of American 
preschoolers are not fully immunized against preventable diseases. 
</P>
<P>
It is frightening, too, that in 1989 there was a more than 400% increase in the 
number of measles cases. 
</P>
<P>
Inadequate funding, public awareness and access to health care are compounding 
the problem. In many states, funds for public clinics do not meet the needs. 
Too many parents also are not aware of the necessity for early and regular 
immunizations. 
</P>
<P>
As a pediatrician and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, I believe 
that immunizations are the single-most, cost-effective procedure to protect 
against potentially life-threatening diseases. Efforts must be intensified to 
increase the availability of immunization services and to ensure that all 
children are vaccinated at the recommended ages -- especially preschool-age 
children.It is shameful that a country as rich as ours does so poor a job 
immunizing its children.

Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.: The San Francisco-based utility said 
second-quarter net income was $166.2 million, down 30% from a year ago. Revenue 
was $2.17 billion, up 4%. PG&amp;E attributed the lower earnings in large part 
to a one-time after-tax charge of $66 million from an adverse decision in 
litigation over the rupture of a water conduit east of Fresno in 1982.

AMR Corp.: The nation's largest airline company said its second-quarter 
earnings fell 27.4% to $129.2 million from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings fell despite a 9.5% increase in revenue to $2.97 billion. The 
Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport-based parent of American Airlines attributed its 
earnings decline to weaker-than-expected traffic and higher operating expenses. 
The firm said revenue increases did not keep up with the rising costs of fuel, 
maintenance and airport operating fees.

JACK SMITH: BETTER TO TAKE NAVY STORIES WITH A GRAIN OF SALT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several readers have questioned the veracity of Cal Wharton's reminisences of 
his tour as skipper of a PT boat in World War II, as recently reported here. 
</P>
<P>
Cal, a retired Times sportswriter, said that during a recent reunion with his 
crew one man recalled that Wharton's first command was: "All right, you guys, 
take the ropes off the posts and let's get going." 
</P>
<P>
"No way. Couldn't happen," writes Don Driscoll, a wartime PT commander himself. 
"I can assure you uttering such a non-Navy order would have been impossible, no 
matter how green the skipper." (Navy lingo would be "cast off the lines.") 
</P>
<P>
"In the first place," Driscoll says, "an officer had to have small boat 
experience to get in the PT service. Long before you stood in front of a 
full-length mirror and were tailored for your first set of Navy Blues, you had 
ceased describing lines as 'ropes.' Certainly after two months of intense 
indoctrination you had learned that there are three ways to do everything: the 
right way, the wrong way, and the Navy way, and God help you if you didn't pick 
the Navy way. . . . By the time you took advanced training at the Motor Torpedo 
Boat School . . . you had become saltier than any Academy graduate." 
</P>
<P>
I was skeptical of Wharton's story myself. But I considered it a harmless 
distortion caused by the passage of too many years or the absorption of too 
much booze. Old wartime buddies tend to exaggerate. 
</P>
<P>
From my own experience in the Marines, I know that when a man emerged from boot 
camp he would no more call a line a rope than he would call a rifle a gun. A 
boot was made to feel that his rifle was a part of himself, and if he 
mistreated it in any way, including verbally, he was made to sleep with it and 
hand it to his drill instructor the next morning warm. 
</P>
<P>
Driscoll also doubts Wharton's story that when an admiral was aboard one day 
his cook asked the admiral if he would like some coffee, and when the admiral 
replied "Yes, thank you," the cook said 'Just a minute, sir. I'll go downstairs 
to the kitchen and get you some.' " 
</P>
<P>
"In the first place," says Driscoll, "the cook wouldn't ask the admiral if he 
wanted some coffee. He would ask him if he wanted a cup of Joe. After the 
admiral replied 'Yes, thank you,' he wouldn't have said anything. He would have 
gone to carry out the mission. He wouldn't have used the words downstairs and 
kitchen since those words were essentially unknown to Navy men whose 
recollections of a civilian life (with its quaint vocabulary) had been 
effectively eradicated in boot camp." 
</P>
<P>
Again, I tend to agree with Driscoll that Wharton's reunion was perhaps a bit 
soggy. On the other hand, perhaps Wharton and his cook hated the Navy, and were 
deliberately defying protocol by using civilian language. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Hockman of Agoura Hills recalls a display of non-nautical language by a 
crew of hot rod automobile mechanics who had acquired a speedboat and invited 
him aboard for the trial run. On returning to port the skipper ordered, "Hey, 
Lou -- jump out and grab the front end . . . and Don, you grab the rear end and 
pull it in." The word used was not rear, however. 
</P>
<P>
War stories don't have to be true. My favorite is the one about the young 
British subaltern who was caught by an MP chasing a Wren (a member of the 
Women's Royal Naval Service) down a hallway in a Cairo hotel. The young officer 
was nude. He was put up on charges of being out of uniform, but was acquitted 
on the grounds that he was properly attired for the activity in which he was 
engaged. 
</P>
<P>
I have serious doubts about the authenticity of that story, but I have always 
chosen to believe it. It makes my memories of the war so much more palatable. 
</P>
<P>
As Wharton and his cook may have been, I was guilty myself of pulling the 
tiger's tail now and then. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when the war was over but I was still stationed at Pearl Harbor, I asked 
my colonel why he couldn't let me go home. 
</P>
<P>
He said, "Smith, I don't like it here either, but I have to stay." 
</P>
<P>
"But sir," I said, "you've got a jeep and a girl friend." 
</P>
<P>
Not long after that I was shipped back to the States. 
</P>
<P>
After I had become a civilian I was introduced in the old press club to Gen. 
Graves Erskine, then commandant of the Marine Corps, as "an ex-Marine." 
</P>
<P>
The general shook my hand and said, "There's no such thing as an ex-Marine, is 
there Smith?" 
</P>
<P>
Wringing the general's hand, I replied, "You're looking at one, general." 
</P>
<P>
Even though I was a civilian, I thought that was a pretty risky thing to say. 
The general might have been right.

Bedtime Stories: When the President can't sleep, he says he doesn't take a 
pill. Instead, he likes to read things that are not "particularly weighty," 
George Bush said Tuesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He included Tom Wolfe's novel "Bonfire of the Vanities," Arthur Hailey's 
"Network News" and Robert Caro's biography of Lyndon Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
* Baby Appeal: Barbara Bush told 26 senior citizen volunteers invited to the 
White House on Monday that "we're running out of you. We've got to get more 
help because, unfortunately, the boarder babies and the babies that need you 
are multiplying." Bush was celebrating the 25th anniversary of ACTION's Foster 
Grandparent Program. 
</P>
<P>
* Helmsman Woes: Sen. Jesse Helms said Tuesday in Raleigh, N.C., that he will 
not fire aide James Meredith for putting out a news release claiming that the 
vast majority of delegates to the recent NAACP convention in Los Angeles were 
drug users or engaged in immoral acts. NAACP leaders have demanded that Helms, 
a conservative Republican, fire Meredith, a former civil rights activist. "Of 
course, I have no knowledge whether those figures are right or wrong," Helms 
said. 
</P>
<P>
* Health Report: Czechoslovakia's ambassador to the United States has leukemia 
and is deciding whether to remain in America for treatment or return home. 
"It's not that we don't have good doctors at home," Rita Klimova said in 
Washington. "But we don't have the ability to protect patients from infection." 
Klimova, who became ambassador five months ago, said she does not want to run 
up a big medical bill for her government.

ANN CONWAY: ALUMNI REKINDLE DISNEY MAGIC

"You can take the man out of Disneyland; but you can't take Disneyland out of 
the man!" That's the reason Van France founded the Disneyland Alumni Club in 
1983, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The dapper and smiling France, for 35 years an employee of the Magic Kingdom, 
was among a few hundred Disneyland alums celebrating the theme park's 35th 
anniversary on Tuesday at the Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Disneyland is a magical, fun place," said France, whose first job at the park 
was training employees. "A fantasy land! To quote Walt Disney, 'Disneyland is 
the star; the employees are supporting members of the cast.' 
</P>
<P>
"Our job is to create happiness for others. I've told our cast members, 
'Emphasize the magic mirror of your smile. Use smiling phrases. Say please and 
thank you. We have guests, not customers!' " 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of training gives Disneyland employees a solid scoop of self-esteem, 
explained Franny Ray, who organized the bash with Andrea Manes, alum president. 
And it makes working at the park an affirming experience -- even after 
employees have gone on to other things. "When I tell people I used to work at 
Disneyland, they always want me to sit down and tell them more," Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
"How many corporations can you think of where employees who have left want to 
come back just to get together?" Manes asked. "In our club, it doesn't matter 
whether you've worked one summer or 35 years. We just want to get back together 
and have fun!" 
</P>
<P>
And have fun they did. First up: a cocktail reception where they posed for 
souvenir Polaroids with Roger Rabbit and Goofy, had their caricatures drawn, 
and perused a gallery of pictorial blowups featuring park visitors such as 
President Richard M. Nixon with his daughter Tricia; President John F. Kennedy; 
and President Bush and Barbara Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was into the colorful ballroom, transformed into its own sort of magic 
kingdom with columns of cotton-candy-pink balloons, trailing orchid 
centerpieces and a bigger-than-life birthday cake sitting on stage. A perfect 
touch: a glittering silver disco ball with Mickey Mouse ears! 
</P>
<P>
After helping themselves to fare at four buffet stations, guests settled back 
to watch a performance by original Golden Horseshoe Revue stars Wally Boag, 
Fulton Burley and Betty Taylor.

Reflecting greater emphasis on writing skills, Orange County high school 
seniors achieved scores nearly 40 points higher than the state average on the 
1990 California Assessment Program writing test, ranking second among the 
state's largest counties, according to statistics recently released by the 
state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The 18,570 Orange County seniors who took the test last December scored an 
average of 294 on the test, 38 points higher than the state average of 256. 
</P>
<P>
Among the state's largest counties, Orange County's average was surpassed only 
by Marin County's average score of 316. However, just 1,564 students took the 
test there. In 1989, Orange County ranked third behind Marin and Contra Costa 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Students countywide surpassed their counterparts from the class of 1989, who

MAGAZINES: ON THE TRAIL OF SOMETHING FISHY;

MAGAZINES: DO WE REALLY NEED ANOTHER FOOD PERIODICAL? THE ANSWER SEEMS TO BE 
"MAYBE SO."

How often have you heard this: Welcome to Seafood R Us. Tonight's specials 
include anisakid nematodes, scombrotox, ciguatoxin, mercury, cadmium, chromium, 
arsenic, lead, dioxin, PCBs, DDT and other chlorinated pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 Not often enough, according to an article in the premiere issue of Eating Well 
-- the Magazine of Food and Health. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1982 and 1986, twice as many people became ill from eating seafood in 
this country as from eating beef and poultry combined, according to testimony 
before a congressional committee. Inspecting 336 imported seafood samples in 
1986, the understaffed FDA found that a quarter contained excessive amounts of 
several monitored substances. 
</P>
<P>
And even then, the inspection system clearly can't be held accountable for much 
of what lands on the platter. "The system of seafood inspection consists of a 
motley patchwork of federal, state and local programs . . . and they result in 
the direct scrutiny of a tiny fraction of the nation's seafood supply," Craig 
Canine writes in a piece, "Something Fishy at the Seafood Counter." 
</P>
<P>
In the article, Canine buys a fillet of alleged red snapper (like much 
so-called red snapper, it turns out to be Pacific rock fish) at a Des Moines 
supermarket, then traces it back along the weeklong route it traveled, passing 
on planes and trucks, through two distribution warehouses, a processing plant 
and three airports, as well as an Oregon-based fishing boat called the "Iron 
Lady." Along the way, the article and companion stories, examine seafood from 
every possible perspective. 
</P>
<P>
It's a surprisingly interesting travelogue. 
</P>
<P>
"Does the world really need another food magazine?" publisher James M. Lawrence 
asks in this charter issue of Eating Well. 
</P>
<P>
Hard though it is to believe, the answer would seem to be "maybe so." A "sister 
publication" of Harrowsmith Country Life, this Vermont-based bimonthly promises 
to provide readers "with the information they need to make eating, cooking and 
buying decisions in their lives. To enlighten readers in the face of 
conflicting reports and advice in other popular media (and) . . . to serve as a 
national forum on the state of the world food chain and how it impacts on the 
lives of our readers." 
</P>
<P>
"Something Fishy at the Seafood Counter," would make a fine main course in 
almost any magazine spread; the rest of the meal -- including a story on the 
nutritional value of onions and a piece on home-baked bread -- is also nicely 
done. (For subscription information, call (800) 344-3350). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REQUIRED READING 
</P>
<P>
* Details magazine is reportedly under the scalpel, undergoing the sort of 
cosmetic transformation that is de rigueur for trendy publications these days. 
But the old format goes out howling, with an August cover by photographer 
William Wegman that is perfectly suited to summer's dog days. His use of 
pooches as clotheshorses is inspired. Nina Blanchard is probably searching the 
county pound for next season's models already. 
</P>
<P>
* The July-August issue of Beach Culture has washed up on newsstands, and from 
the oddly amusing black and white cover to the wildly colorful ads, it's the 
visual equivalent of a big day at Rincon: a crowded, jarring, challenging but 
ultimately exhilarating experience that leaves readers satiated and slightly 
dazed. The debut winter issue of this magazine was pretty, but oozed 
self-satisfied surf-dude pretensions. With the summer issue, the magazine finds 
its rhythm and starts to shred. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight is a dazzling portfolio of painters' and photographers' 
impressions of summer. If there's a down side, it's that the relentless 
artistry of the issue extends to the typesetting. Form takes a sadistic swipe 
at function, leaving some of the intriguing print almost impossible to read. In 
the first issue, few articles were worth the effort. This time, several pay off 
nicely -- notably, an old, never published interview of director David Lynch. 
There's also a piece looking back at an encounter between Charles Manson and 
the Beach Boys, which informs, among other things, that the latest word for hot 
surfing this summer is Manson -- as in "that guy totally Mansoned that wave." 
</P>
<P>
* In 1874, when a young girl named Mary Ellen McCormack testified before a New 
York City court that she was regularly whipped and beaten by a mother who had 
never even purchased her a pair of shoes, there was no legal means to save a 
child from child abuse in this country. It took the intervention of the founder 
of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to get a judge 
to hear McCormack's case. McCormack's testimony, a reporter there wrote, 
"stirred the soul of a city and roused the conscience of a world that had 
forgotten. . . . I knew I was where the first chapter of children's rights was 
being written." That still relevant episode is recounted in the July-August 
American Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
* " 'The Andy Griffith Show' is a beautiful combination of laughs and sniffles, 
physical humor and well-crafted dialogue." The "Rockford Files" was probably 
television's "best-written, best-acted hour." And those shows are the No. 1 and 
No. 2 best television shows in television history, says the July 20, 
Entertainment Weekly. Readers will find ample cause to argue with certain 
choices. EW is, however, clearly right about "Griffith," "Rockford," "WKRP," 
"Lucy," "MASH," and "Bonanza," and clearly wrong about "The Love Boat," "Good 
Times" and "Laverne &amp; Shirley." 
</P>
<P>
* Some bird lovers may be put off by the matter-of-fact photographs of dead 
specimens, but most birders and amateur ornithologists are likely to be 
enthralled with the summer issue of Terra, the magazine of the Natural History 
Museum of Los Angeles County. The issue features articles on the condor 
rehabitation program, the retrospective detective work that goes into the study 
of prehistoric bird species, and an interesting discussion of why the museum 
maintains a collection of more than 100,000 whole or partial bird carcasses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHREDDER FODDER 
</P>
<P>
* The August-October issue of Special Report -- on Personalities (one of those 
Whittle Communications single-issue magazines you find only in doctor's 
offices) has a pretty good piece on how the American justice system deals with 
celebrity law-breakers. It quotes Jay Leno's joke on Zsa Zsa Gabor's sentence 
for cop-slapping: "Well, that should send a strong message to drug lords that 
America knows how to get tough on crime." But the magazine hypocritically 
features Gabor on its cover, wearing sequinned boxing gloves and laughing -- at 
the law, apparently.

YOUR WHEELS: WHO PAYS FOR MISTAKEN REPAIR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As cars become more complex, the job of diagnosing mechanical problems is 
growing into a major nightmare for motorists. Even competent and honest 
mechanics can make a mistake in diagnosing what is causing a suspension noise, 
an engine stall or an overheating condition, among many other problems. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, a faulty diagnosis is even worse than a bad repair, since the 
motorist is left without knowing what is causing the problem in his or her car. 
As cars become more sophisticated, automobile manufacturers have attempted to 
help mechanics by building in computerized diagnostic systems that self-test 
various systems in the car. 
</P>
<P>
But these computer systems are often beyond the comprehension of most 
neighborhood mechanics. And as a car ages, primary or secondary owners become 
more reluctant to pay the high premiums charged by dealership garages. 
</P>
<P>
All too often, garages engage in trial and error to find a problem. If the car 
is stalling, they will perform a tuneup first, regardless of whether the car 
has been tuned up recently. Then, it's on to exhaust gas recirculation valves, 
fuel injectors, distributor wires, coils and on and on until they find the 
problem. This is clearly an unacceptable expense. 
</P>
<P>
What can a motorist fairly expect if he or she takes a car into a garage and a 
repair is performed which does not solve the problem? It is a gray area, far 
more difficult to handle than a simple faulty repair. 
</P>
<P>
Even though most states have consumer protection laws that are supposed to 
safeguard motorists from dishonest mechanics, no government can legislate 
competence. In California, for example, state laws do not specifically say that 
a motorist is entitled to a refund if a faulty diagnosis leads to an 
unnecessary repair. 
</P>
<P>
So all too often, the motorist is left to his own devices. 
</P>
<P>
One school of thought holds that the mechanic is supposed to be the expert and 
should back his diagnosis. If a repair does not solve a problem, then the 
garage should provide a refund or credit for the subsequent correct repair. 
</P>
<P>
But trying to jawbone a refund from a garage is a tough task. Many mechanics 
will insist that what they repaired was broken. 
</P>
<P>
The other school of thought is that mechanics, like doctors, rocket scientists 
and journalists, sometimes make mistakes. Is it really fair to expect a 
mechanic to give up part of his day's pay for an honest mistake? 
</P>
<P>
The issue revolves around what is reasonable, based on how faulty the diagnosis 
was and whether the mechanic should have known better. Experts in the area of 
dispute resolution argue that in most cases, a mechanic should make an 
adjustment if a repair was based on a faulty diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
"Is the customer responsible for paying for an honest mistake? No," argues 
David Taylor, a program manager for California Bureau of Automotive Repair. 
"The mechanic is the expert." 
</P>
<P>
Clair Villano, chairman of Automotive Service Excellence, a national 
organization that certifies mechanics, said dispute arbitration boards often 
will back the motorist if a diagnosis is incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than go to arbitration, many mechanics will try to find some middle 
ground and bear at least some of the cost for the mistake. Motorists hold a 
strong hand if they are regular customers of the garage, since the mechanic 
will see a concession as an investment in keeping the customer's future 
business. One way to help avoid such disputes is for consumers to refrain from 
making their own diagnosis. If the repair doesn't solve the problem, then the 
mechanic cannot argue that he followed the motorists instructions.

ERMA BOMBECK: WHEN A DISH RATTLES, CHILDREN COME RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My husband said the other day, "We haven't seen our kids in a while." 
</P>
<P>
"You want to see your kids?" I asked. "I can arrange it." 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to call and tell them we're changing the will again, are you? 
We've overdone that one." 
</P>
<P>
"No, no. At least one of them will be here tonight for dinner. Trust me." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough. At 6 p.m. we heard a key in the door and our son walked in. My 
husband was astounded. "How did you do that?" he asked me. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy. I defrosted and cooked two thin pork chops for dinner." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way it's been ever since they got their own apartments. I cook 
enough spaghetti to feed Sicily and no one shows. I nuke two small pieces of 
leftover pizza for dinner and they fly in from out of state. 
</P>
<P>
How do they know I've cooked for two? It's one of the great mysteries of child 
raising. Kids were equipped with radar long before it went commercial. They 
knew when there were bananas hidden behind the popcorn popper in the pantry. 
They knew when there was a candy bar in the meat keeper in the refrigerator. It 
was not possible for a leftover piece of pie to survive a child in search of 
breakfast. When a dish rattles, they hear it, no matter where they are. 
</P>
<P>
When you think about it, mothers set themselves up for it. We've dedicated our 
lives to feeding our kids. Nothing went hungry. I fed a cold; I fed a fever. If 
an infant cried, I stuffed a bottle in her mouth. If a child fell off a 
bicycle, I promised him ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
"You may not graduate? Have a piece of cake." 
</P>
<P>
"Your car was totaled? Have you had lunch?" 
</P>
<P>
"You're not overweight. You're too thin. Eat!" 
</P>
<P>
We have created an image for ourselves of being able to feed a crowd on a pound 
of hamburger and bring forth food when the cupboards are bare. It has always 
been. My grandmother would scurry when we pulled into the driveway. She'd open 
cans with one hand and set four more places at the table with the other. My 
mother did the same thing when five of us parked in front of the house at 
dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
Now that I think about it . . . maybe they just wanted to see us.

A LOVE TRIANGLE WITH JUST 2 SIDES; 
</P>
<P>
PRIVATE KNOWLEDGE BY BETTY PALMER NELSON ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $16.95; 256 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By URSULA HEGI, Hegi's latest book, Floating in My Mother's Palm, is a novel 
set in postwar Germany. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine this: A woman is forced into celibacy by the pact between two men who 
believe they are acting in her best interest. The time: 1849 to 1859. The 
setting: rural Tennessee. The men: her lover and her husband-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
In her well-researched first novel, Betty Palmer Nelson provides her readers 
with fresh insights into the dynamics within an arranged marriage, even if this 
marriage was arranged by the bride's lover. She takes a close look at the 
nature of love -- its promises and compromises, its deceptions and surprises. 
Love is bartered, misunderstood and redefined, but ultimately it endures only 
where it is nurtured without expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Molly Hampton, the heroine in "Private Knowledge," is the daughter of a bitter 
woman and a lazy man, who relies on luck and manipulates the generosity of 
others. In church, Molly is told that a woman's role is to serve her family, 
and she learns early to assume most of the household responsibilities. Her one 
escape is into a fantasy world where she is loved and wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most fascinating characters in this first novel is Molly's mother. 
Frail and resentful, she blames her children for her poor health and believes 
that the one-room cabin is below her station as a Virginia lady. "They had gone 
from one poor place to another, taking more children with them each time." 
Pretty things have become memories whose ghosts destroy the quality of her life 
because nothing else can possibly measure up. 
</P>
<P>
It's essential for Molly to free herself from her parents, and her independence 
begins when she asserts herself against her father -- a step that marks her an 
outcast within her family. Despite the plans that others make for her, and 
despite her frequent concessions to their wishes, she emerges stronger and more 
aware of her choices. 
</P>
<P>
When she falls in love with a married man, Benjamin, she feels guilty at her 
passionate response: "Only bad women felt that way." Though Benjamin is in love 
with her, he feels confined to his loveless marriage with Etta Sue, a shallow 
society woman who keeps comparing herself to others. Etta Sue comes across as a 
stereotype until Nelson taps into deeper layers of her character with lyrical 
prose that surpasses the language of her narrative and shows the roots of Etta 
Sue's insecurities. She dreams of being a girl again, excluded from the play of 
other children, and when they finally let her participate, they trick and 
abandon her. 
</P>
<P>
After Molly becomes pregnant with Benjamin's child, she reluctantly agrees to 
marry his friend, Simon, who has been celibate for nearly a quarter of a 
century. He proposes the union with Molly for the sake of companionship: "She 
would be like a daughter to me. Or a sister." He has a noble history of 
rescuing women while keeping his distance. Once, he loved a married woman but 
left his home in order to preserve her honor. He takes responsibility for Molly 
and her unborn child while defending his role as husband against Benjamin's old 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
Although an affection develops between Molly and Simon, she feels like a 
stranger in his house and longs for Benjamin. Simon is unsettled by his 
feelings for his young wife, whose pregnancy causes her to move with an 
unfamiliar dignity. "Her wrists and the bones of her face seemed more delicate, 
as though her substance were being drawn off into the child she was carrying." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson develops Simon's story in parallels that illuminate his past and present 
with two women who don't entirely belong to him. She draws a convincing picture 
of his marriage to a much younger woman who matures in the supportive 
environment he provides for her. As their age difference ceases to matter, 
Simon grows more attractive to Molly, while she moves with him on the same 
level of decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
Though the prologue and epilogue are stiff and forced, "Private Knowledge" 
reveals the contrasts between the different levels of a highly class-conscious 
society. Nelson juxtaposes gala balls and hunts with authentic details of 
homesteading. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, Molly is given her choice between the two men. Although the outcome 
is predictable, the path toward that resolution is original, since Nelson takes 
her characters through believable struggles as they come up against their own 
human flaws and against circumstances they would not have chosen. 
</P>
<P>
"Private Knowledge" explores different kinds of losses, coming to terms with 
those losses, and the discovery of strength that comes with Molly's 
transcendence over the moral judgment of her time that "she had sinned as he 
(Benjamin) had sinned, perhaps worse since she was a woman." Shedding her 
innocence and guilt, she grows toward the moment where she determines her 
destiny instead of settling for a narrow concept of punishment.

Equal Justice for 'Equalizer' Suit: Hollywood writer and producer Lou Shaw has 
a legitimate right to pursue a copyright infringement suit over the pilot 
script for the "Equalizer" television series, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco ruled Tuesday. The appeals court said there was 
"substantial similarity" between a copyright script called "The Equalizer," 
written by Shaw in 1979, and the series pilot that appeared in 1985, allowing 
Shaw to sue the show's creators. The decision sent the case back to U.S. 
District Court in Pasadena, which had previously dismissed Shaw's claims. BETH

'STEEL' GETS A GRIP ON FIRST PLACE

"Steel Magnolias," the all-star female drama that's a big hit among female 
renters, swept past second-ranked "Tango and Cash" to the top of the Billboard 
magazine rental chart. The strongest new competitor for the No. 1 position is 
"The War of the Roses." 
</P>
<P>
Fans are so fascinated by the warring Roses that this black comedy rocketed to 
No. 4 in just two weeks. Look for it to take over the top spot sometime in the 
next few weeks. "We're No Angels," with Robert DeNiro and Sean Penn -- a 
lukewarm attraction when it played theaters -- is doing just modest rental 
business, moving up four notches to No. 19. "Family Business," the star-studded 
(Sean Connery and Dustin Hoffman) box-office dud, debuted at No. 31. 
</P>
<P>
* Expected to be one of the mightiest box-office hits last Christmas, 
"She-Devil" turned out to be one of the season's biggest bombs -- pulling in a 
meager $14.5 million. Fans didn't turn out in bunches to see TV star Roseanne 
Barr sparring with Meryl Streep for the affections of Ed Begley Jr. This comedy 
hasn't been a rental smash either, but its star power has attracted some 
renters. No. 12 after two weeks, it could crack the Top 10 next week.

The Laguna Art Museum has been awarded -- and has accepted -- two grants 
totaling $9,000 for collection, maintenance and conservation from the National 
Endowment for the Arts. The grants are being accepted, despite what amounts to 
a mandatory oath not to promote obscene artworks with the federal funds, said 
museum director Charles Desmarais. 
</P>
<P>
A letter of protest will be sent with the grant acceptance forms, however. The 
letter will not state non-compliance with the oath, but will note the museum's 
objection to it, Desmarais said. The NEA has said that grantees are not free to 
select from among 29 conditions of funding which they will or will not obey. 
The two NEA grants bring to three the museum has accepted this year. About 10 
NEA grant recipients around the country, none of them in Orange County, have 
rejected their awards to protest the obscenity clause.

GOLDEN WEST COLLEGE'S 'BLACK COFFEE' PROVES A BIT WEAK; 
</P>
<P>
THE PRODUCTION OF AGATHA CHRISTIE'S FIRST PLAY SUFFERS FROM STAGING 
DIFFICULTIES AND UNREALIZED CHARACTERS.

<P>
Agatha Christie fans may be interested in "Black Coffee" at Golden West 
College, if only because it's one of the few plays featuring Hercule Poirot, 
the Belgian sleuth Christie created for her many mystery novels. 
</P>
<P>
At Poirot's side in this 1930 whodunit is Capt. Hastings, the detective's usual 
man Friday. Even hapless Inspector Japp, another familiar Christie invention, 
makes an appearance. Add to this the fact that "Black Coffee" was the first 
play written by the prodigious author and the plot thickens for Christie 
die-hards. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it's a slow-moving production offered by GWC, one that makes 
mistakes in the basic presentation and prevents "Black Coffee" from having the 
needed kick to keep us savoring throughout. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to stage this mystery -- about the suspicious death of Sir Claude 
Amory (Robert Schmaltz III) and the swiping of his atomic weapons blueprint -- 
in a theater-in-the-round setting is something of a mystery in itself. We 
gather evidence and follow character development from expressions and 
attitudes, but it's not always easy to pick them up from the various vantage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Despite David P. Falzon's detailed set, the staging results in blocking 
difficulties for director Steven Jay Warner, which results in accessibility 
difficulties for the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The cast, with few exceptions, doesn't always make the most of Christie's 
characters, as usual a colorful lot with veneers of humor. The English accents 
are in place, but not much of the eccentric stylization that can make this type 
of antique more amusing. 
</P>
<P>
Only Simone Slifman as the vivacious Barbara Amory and Eric Hansen as Hastings 
bring enough waggish impulse to the arch roles. 
</P>
<P>
As for Poirot, Douglas L. Hartman is comical all right, but he doesn't really 
meet our expectations of this grandly rich and, at times, insufferable 
character. Hartman portrays him as meticulous, as he should, but it's more of a 
mincing mannerism than the manifestation of a precisely analytical mind. 
</P>

'MAY FOOLS' FROM LOUIS MALLE . . . HOLD THE CELEBRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A film by Louis Malle is generally an occasion for celebration. "May Fools" 
(Music Hall, Esquire, Pasadena) is not exactly an exception, it's simply way 
down the list of that urbane director's best efforts. It's not, heaven help us, 
"Black Moon," or "Crackers," but it can't even rub shoulders with "Murmur of 
the Heart" or "Lacombe Lucien" or "Au Revoir Les Enfants." 
</P>
<P>
Malle's best films cast a warm if ironic eye on the foibles of his fellow man. 
In "May Fools," co-written with Jean-Claude Carriere, the director seems 
remote, his characters thin to the point of caricature. 
</P>
<P>
These comfortable landowners are walking the countryside of Jean Renoir, there 
is even a literal link to that director's films in the casting of 82-year-old 
Paulette Dubost as the matriarch of the family -- she was the maid in Renoir's 
1939 classic "Rules of the Game." And in a love of family and place, there is a 
suggestion of Tavernier's bucolic masterpiece, "A Sunday in the Country." Yet 
"May Fools" is not lyrical filmmaking, it's oddly abrupt and unsubtle, even 
with music by Stephane Grappelli to nudge and bridge his story along. 
</P>
<P>
It's the May of the French student revolutions, 1968, as militant students 
supported by striking workers nationwide have brought France to a standstill, 
threatening to overturn De Gaulle's government with their demands for social 
reform. As one young man just back from Paris describes it, the fire of 
revolution in his voice, "People are holding hands, they're talking; they meet 
and make love right away." 
</P>
<P>
The film takes place in the rich French wine country, where the Vieuzac family 
has had its rambling villa for generations. Paris seems remote. News of its 
street fighting comes in spurts from an unreliable radio or via equally 
unreliable rumors from the nearby village. In any case Milou (Michel Piccoli) 
who's managed the family vineyard for decades, has more urgent matters to 
consider; his mother (Dubost), matriarch of the family, has just died. Quickly 
summoned, the family members stream to the country for the funeral and, more 
importantly to each of them, the reading of Mme. Vieuzac's will. 
</P>
<P>
Malle is a little cavalier about the relationships; halfway through the film, 
we may still be untangling them. In any case, Mme. Vieuzac's children include 
Piccoli's Milou, a widower who has lived on the estate most of his life; 
Camille (Miou-Miou), his materialistic married daughter, a summation of 
everything small-minded and mean about the bourgeoisie; Georges (Michel 
Duchaussoy), Milou's slightly younger brother, a correspondent for Le Monde who 
sprinkles his speech with little English expressions; Lily, (Harriet Walter) 
Georges' English actress-wife and Claire (Dominique Blanc), Mme. Vieuzac's 
orphaned granddaughter who arrives for the services with her fetching young 
lover, ballet student Marie-Laure (Rozenn Le Tallec). 
</P>
<P>
Others include Adele (Martine Gautier), Mme. Vieuzac's devoted young 
housekeeper and, bearing bruises from Paris street fighting, Georges' son, 
Pierre-Alain (Renaud Danner), and the friendly macho trucker, Grimaldi (Bruno 
Carette), who although hardly a revolutionary himself, has picked up the young 
man and delivered him to his doorstep. So, amid meals of crayfish and wine, 
family reminiscences, tensions, bickering and flirtations, the formalities 
attending the end of a life unfold. 
</P>
<P>
Best among the actors are Blanc, who looks as though she could play Edith Piaf, 
big-eyed and tormented; Miou-Miou, biting in her thankless role and Piccoli as 
the only family member to weep for his mother. He's also splendid in his 
exchanges with Camille's inquisitive pre-teen-age daughter Francoise 
(engagingly played by Miou-Miou's own daughter, Jeanne Herry-Leclerc), unfazed 
by her questions as to why Claire ties Marie-Laure to the bedpost at night, or 
what all this talk about "the pill" means. 
</P>
<P>
The film's criss-crossing alliances are conventional; the tryst in the hayloft, 
the pinch in the hall, the slap-and-tickle in the wine cellar. (Its R rating is 
for brief nudity.) What Renoir investigates with rueful wisdom and what Chekhov 
-- in the films of Nikita Mikhalkov -- has displayed with infinite subtlety, 
Malle does here with neither urgency nor particular freshness. 
</P>
<P>
Malle, superb at puncturing the rich right during the political upheaval of the 
1950s in "Murmur of the Heart" is reduced to creating a midnight trek by all 
concerned to avoid being massacred in their beds by revolutionary mobs. Silly 
and arbitrary, it's an exhausted excuse for closure. Better is the final 
farewell of son and mother, gently sentimental but at least in keeping with the 
tone of the rest of "May Fools."

JARVI LEADS PHILHARMONIC AT HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditionally the quietest period of the summer season at Hollywood Bowl, the 
second week of subscription concerts in 1990 began, unsurprisingly, with 
low-key performances from the Los Angeles Philharmonic led by Neeme Jarvi. 
</P>
<P>
If these readings -- of Smetana's "Prodana Nevesta" Overture, Rachmaninoff's 
"Paganini" Rhapsody (with soloist Misha Dichter) and the Seventh Symphony by 
Dvorak -- eschewed any hints of grandstanding, they were not modest. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, they upheld another tradition, the one to which Jarvi became associated 
when he appeared here last summer: They proved musically satisfying as well as 
technically proficient. 
</P>
<P>
Jarvi, returning on Tuesday night to the scene of his 1989 successes, did it 
again. He coaxed involved, careful and tightly structured performances from our 
cooperative orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Dvorak's Seventh was the most obvious beneficiary of the Estonian conductor's 
strong, no-nonsense leadership. It simply flowed, like a wide-ranging, 
sometimes vociferous conversation between passionate friends, touching many 
subjects but never losing direction or its thread of thought. And the playing 
of the Philharmonic emerged splendidly clarified. 
</P>
<P>
With less heat, the same forces produced a clean and competent reading of 
Rachmaninoff's famous Rhapsody, one in which pianist Dichter inspired 
admiration for poetic statement as well as reliable virtuosity. This 
performance sounded grand, though it never really caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
The evening began with the cherishable charms of the "Bartered Bride" excerpt, 
nicely paced and neatly played. 
</P>

'FAMILY BAGGAGE' MORE THERAPY THAN THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's the little matter of truth in advertising. "Family Baggage" at the 
Wilshire Ebell Theatre is billed as theatre -- as a play. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't any such thing. 
</P>
<P>
The co-writers of this series of therapeutic skits, Errol Strider and Lou 
Montgomery, appear in the presentation, though Strider's wife Rochelle Alicia 
sometimes takes Montgomery's place. They are credited in press releases as 
actors and therapists. The former they may be, but not here. In "Family 
Baggage" the therapist takes the spotlight, along with the intermission 
huckstering of their videos and workshops. 
</P>
<P>
The subject is "adult children" of dysfunctional families, the "co-dependent" 
person. Strider and Montgomery define this term "depending on someone who's 
depending on something that's not reliable." They mean any addiction, from 
alcohol to drugs to power to you name it. They include Jewish mothers addicted 
to domineering and fathers addicted to fondling their children. 
</P>
<P>
They are the voice of the "pity-me generation" of the '90s, an outgrowth of the 
"stroke-me generation" of the '80s and the basic "me generation" of the '70s. 
They want to live in "Father Knows Best" and be grown-up Bettys and Buds, 
forgetting that life isn't like that. That's not how character is built, nor 
great works, nor nations. It's sad that children sometimes have a rough time 
making it into adulthood, but Darwin's survival of the fittest tells why. 
</P>
<P>
It may not be a balm to the pity-me's, but one has to stop and think. Happy, 
bland existences do not create a need to make something of yourself. Without 
dysfunctional families we wouldn't have had Michelangelo or Da Vinci, the work 
of Freud or the genius of Eugene O'Neill. We wouldn't even have the humor of 
Neil Simon, whose "Brighton Beach Memoirs" is as human and loving a picture of 
a dysfunctional family as you can find. 
</P>
<P>
Without dysfunctional families, Strider and Montgomery would probably be doing 
community theater somewhere in vapid giddiness. Instead, Strider is president 
of Creative Recovery Inc., according to the program, and has "developed a new 
paradigm for creative communication called Creative Recovery Training which 
supports people and organizations in making the shift from a 
co-dependent/addictive model to a co-creative model for personal and 
interpersonal wholeness." These workshops are then advertised in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Strider is an operative mime, and Montgomery can work up a tear or two when her 
lines require it, but they should be grateful to their dysfunctional families 
for providing them with careers, and handle their family baggage with affection 
for the blessings it contains. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4401 W. 8th St.,; Wednesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; mat. Sunday, 2 p.m.; 
indefinitely. $18-$25; (213) 939-1128 or (714) 740-2000.

Strategically situated on the ancient Silk Road connecting Europe with the Far 
East, Afghanistan was for centuries the meeting point of many cultures, 
especially Central Asian, Middle Eastern and Indian. Its food is a fusion of 
ancient cuisines. 
</P>
<P>
There are pastas and steamy dumplings from the Persians and the nomadic Turks; 
glorious breads and yogurt sauces from Central Asia; Middle Eastern roasts, 
pilafs and delicate filo pastries; and sweet spices from India. Dishes such as 
ravioli with creamy leek filling, smoky grilled kebabs with fiery 
walnut-coriander dip, pumpkin topped with yogurt and meat sauce, noodle soup 
with meat balls and braised spinach and rhubarb with dill may have a trendy 
sound, but they are everyday fare in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Kebabs, an especially popular item in restaurants, are the centerpiece of 
Afghan cuisine. "We make kebabs with lean cubes of meat and exquisitely season 
them with yogurt and spices before threading them on skewers and charbroiling," 
says K. Wali Shokoor, owner of Khyber Pass in Berkeley. As a result, the kebabs 
are mild, succulent and highly aromatic. A perky herb dip, a green salad and 
the earthy, oversized pita-like bread called nan generally accompany these 
kebabs. 
</P>
<P>
The real jewel of Afghan food, however, is its vegetables. "We have a way with 
vegetables to make simple ones taste extraordinary," says Mohammed Ashraf 
Karimi, owner of Bamiyan in Washington, D.C, the oldest Afghan restaurant in 
the United States (it opened in 1975). Afghan cuisine often combines vegetables 
with palate-stimulating toppings such as a small portion of flavored meat (a 
familiar East Asian technique) or highly seasoned dressings such as yogurt 
sauce (a Middle-Eastern way of enriching a dish) made with plain yogurt, minced 
garlic and salt. 
</P>
<P>
Vegetables such as pumpkin, eggplant, cauliflower, okra and leeks thus are 
turned into scrumptious preparations. Kadu, for example, combines sweet pumpkin 
with spicy ground meat and a garlicky sauce. Similarly, Banjan borani -- an 
Afghan ratatouille of eggplant, tomatoes, hot chiles and coriander -- is 
mellowed with a tart yogurt sauce. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, Afghan food is very delicate," says Helen Saberi, a British woman 
who married into a traditional Afghan family and has written the most 
comprehensive book on its food and customs, "Noshe Djan: Afghan Food and 
Cookery" (Prospect Books, 1986). Chinese chives, she explains, are preferred 
over onions, and herbs -- mint, dill, coriander and parsley -- and citrus 
flavorings such as lemon and even bitter orange essence are used in place of 
spices. 
</P>
<P>
This is evident in the delicate veal-sausage kebabs lola kebab, flavored with 
just a touch of ground coriander; the fragrant chive turnovers bolani gandana 
do not contain any spices at all. "We consider Afghan food non-spicy but 
scented," says Saberi. 
</P>
<P>
Afghan cuisine also relies upon contrasting sensations to stimulate the palate: 
cool against hot, mild against spicy. "Our customers are constantly amazed at 
the way Afghan food combines various components of flavor," says Nassir Ahmad 
Bayat, chef/owner of Pamir Restaurant in New York City, explaining how 
piping-hot dumplings, pasta and vegetables, for example, are served with cool 
yogurt sauce and mellow kebabs and turnovers are paired with fiery condiments 
such as walnut-coriander dip. 
</P>
<P>
Afghan cuisine is extraordinarily flavorful, hearty and robust. At best it can 
be described as comfort food, soothing and reassuring as an "easy-go-down," in 
the words of M.F.K. Fisher. Riesling, Chardonnay, a malty beer or iced tea make 
excellent accompaniments.

<P>
Although both carrots and cheese, when linked with cake, would seem to connote 
a dessert, this dish is nothing of the kind. It's a savory first or main course 
that, when made a day ahead and served cold, makes an ideal hot-weather lunch 
or dinner. 
</P>
<P>
SAVORY CARROT CHEESECAKE 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
1 medium sweet onion (Vidalia, Maui or Texas Sweet), chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups grated carrots 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons minced fresh basil or 2 teaspoons dried, crumbled 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons fresh minced oregano or 2 teaspoons dried, crumbled 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
2 large eggs, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter in large skillet over low heat. Saute onion and garlic until onion 
is tender and translucent. Add carrots and continue to saute, stirring well to 
blend. 
</P>
<P>
As mixture begins to dry, add lemon juice and stir well to coat. Stir in basil, 
oregano, ginger and salt. Remove from heat. 
</P>
<P>
Combine ricotta, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses with electric hand mixer until 
smooth. Beat in eggs until well combined. Stir in carrot mixture thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Lightly grease 6-inch springform pan. Spoon cheese mixture into pan and smooth 
top. Place in oven, with pan of water on shelf below. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 375 degrees 50 minutes or until top has browned and knife inserted in 
center comes out clean. If top browns too soon, cover with foil. 
</P>
<P>
Turn heat off, open oven door and let cheesecake stand 15 minutes. Remove from 
oven and serve immediately, or let cool to room temperature, refrigerate and 
serve chilled. Makes 4 to 6 servings.

NEW GAS-POWERED TANDOOR OVEN FOR U.S. KITCHENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Indian restaurant without a tandoor oven is like a Mexican restaurant 
without a tortilla. At least, that's the way it is in the United States, where 
tandoori chicken, lamb tikka, seekh kebab and other grilled meats dominate 
virtually every menu. 
</P>
<P>
Without a tandoor, it's impossible to duplicate these succulent meats, or to 
make naan breads, which are slapped on the tandoor's walls to puff and brown in 
what seems like seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Home cooks attempting to copy these foods either give up in frustration or 
content themselves with a not-very-authentic simulation. Importing a clay 
tandoor from India is expensive, and although there are dealers here who can 
supply the ovens, installing, maintaining and stoking them seems the province 
of the professional. 
</P>
<P>
But this may change, thanks to Surjit S. Kalsi, president of Dynamic Cooking 
Systems Inc. of Huntington Beach. Kalsi has introduced a stainless-steel, 
gas-powered tandoor that comes in two sizes: a commercial oven for restaurants 
and a small model for home use. 
</P>
<P>
The large oven can accommodate 10 to 12 whole chickens and up to a dozen naans. 
The home version can hold at least five naans and 8 to 10 whole chicken legs. 
Shaped like an inverted cone, the domestic oven weighs approximately 50 pounds 
and stands 2 feet tall. It operates with a propane tank, thus making it 
portable, or it can be attached to a gas line. In about 15 minutes, the oven 
heats to full tandoor power: 900 degrees. At that temperature, a chicken leg 
will cook in 10 minutes or less, and a naan in a minute or so. The sides of the 
commercial oven remain cool to the touch when it is in use. The outer shell of 
the home model does heat up, but not enough to burn. 
</P>
<P>
Kalsi compares the steel ovens to the clay tandoor in this fashion: "It's like 
the difference between a bullock cart and an airplane. They both get you from 
point A to point B, but one is faster, easier and cleaner." 
</P>
<P>
But ask Sada Riva Rao, the chef and owner of Bombay Grill, if he'd use a steel 
tandoor and he emphatically says, "No, ma'am -- you can't control it. It burns 
the chicken and the bread." And, he insists, the texture of naan baked in a 
non-clay tandoor isn't as soft and smooth as it should be. (Rao tried using a 
metal tandoor in a San Francisco restaurant.) 
</P>
<P>
Other purists insist that only a charcoal-fueled, clay tandoor can produce 
authentic tandoori flavor. Kalsi disagrees. "Charcoal does not impart flavor," 
he says. "Flavor is imparted by juices dripping on the charcoal and producing 
smoke." In his ovens, the juices drip onto lava rock and produce the requisite 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the clay tandoor must be fueled constantly and cleaned of the resulting 
ashes, the lava rock in the steel ovens will last for a year. And the ovens are 
self-cleaning, requiring only an occasional wipe-down, Kalsi said. Unlike the 
clay tandoor, the steel ovens will not crack or flake. 
</P>
<P>
Kalsi introduced the steel tandoors two years ago. Initially they met with 
resistance from the Indian community, but that is changing, he said. So far, he 
has sold about 200 of the commercial ovens, shipping some of them across the 
country, and 300 of the home size. The large oven retails for $1,600, the home 
size for $350. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly vice president of engineering with an appliance manufacturing company, 
Kalsi launched the ovens as a back-yard project. He came up with the design, 
ordered the parts from outside and assembled them. Now Kalsi operates from a 
roomy factory, where he also produces cooktops, outdoor barbecues and 
commercial Korean barbecue units. 
</P>
<P>
The tandoors are literally part of the family. The home model is named Surya 
and the restaurant model Swaneel, after Kalsi's sons. Wife Kawaljit (Kali) 
lends a hand when Kalsi needs someone to demonstrate that naan breads will 
stick to the steel sides (traditionalists believe they will stick only to clay) 
or that chicken tikka (marinated chunks of chicken) can acquire true tandoor 
flavor in the steel oven. 
</P>
<P>
Kalsi is from Jullundur in the Punjab, where tandoor cookery is a common 
pursuit, and his wife is from Lucknow, the capital of the state of Uttar 
Pradesh. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not changed the concept. What we have done is use different material," 
Kalsi said. "It's old technology brought to a modern age."

BACK TO BASICS: TAKE A SHORT COURSE ON SHORTCAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the best ways to show off fresh summer fruit is in an old-fashioned 
shortcake. Strawberries may best exemplify this dessert, but other berries, 
peaches, nectarines and plums also make excellent fillings. 
</P>
<P>
Although flaky cookies, pound or shortened cakes and spongecakes may be used as 
the base, old-fashioned shortcake is traditionally made with a slightly 
sweetened biscuit dough. Whether the surface is left rough or smoothed and 
sprinkled with sugar is a matter of personal preference. 
</P>
<P>
Tree fruit may be peeled, if desired, then sliced. Halve or slice strawberries; 
leave other small berries whole. Sprinkle fruit with sugar, set aside and 
occasionally stir gently until the sugar dissolves and forms a syrup. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, place the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in a large bowl. Cut 
in the butter and/or shortening with a pastry blender (Step 1) until the 
mixture resembles coarse meal. 
</P>
<P>
Make a well in the center of the ingredients and add the milk all at once (Step 
2). Stir with a fork until well moistened and the dough begins to pull away 
from the sides of the bowl (Step 3). 
</P>
<P>
Spoon the dough into a 9-inch round cake pan that has been greased with 
shortening. Spread to cover the bottom of the pan (Step 4). The top may be left 
rough or smoothed, depending on personal preference. Sprinkle with sugar, (Step 
5) if desired. 
</P>
<P>
Shortcake is baked at 425 degrees 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown and a 
wood pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool 
on a wire rack about 10 minutes, then turn out of the pan. 
</P>
<P>
Using a long, serrated knife, slice the warm shortcake in half horizontally 
(Step 6). Spread the bottom half with whipped cream, then spoon on fruit (Step 
7). 
</P>
<P>
Place the top half over the fruit (Step 8) and cover with more whipped cream 
(Step 9). Garnish the top with additional fruit (Step 10). Cut into wedges to 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
OLD-FASHIONED SHORTCAKE 
</P>
<P>
1 3/4 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
Sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons chilled butter 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons shortening 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup milk or half and half 
</P>
<P>
Combine flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, salt and baking powder in large bowl. Cut in 
butter and shortening with pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. 
</P>
<P>
Make well in center of ingredients and add milk all at once. Stir with fork 
until well moistened and dough begins to pull away from sides of bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Spoon dough into greased 9-inch round cake pan. Smooth top and sprinkle with 
sugar, if desired. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 425 degrees 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown and wood pick 
inserted in center comes out clean. Remove from oven and cool on wire rack 10 
minutes, then turn out of pan. Makes 1 (9-inch) shortcake, 6 to 8 servings.

YOU ASKED ABOUT: MORCILLA SAUSAGE IN SPANISH MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have an interest in a sausage called morcilla. It is listed as an 
ingredient in several Spanish recipes. However, I have been unable to find any. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to "The Von Welanetz Guide to Ethnic Ingredients" (Warner 
Books, 1987) by Diana and Paul Von Welanetz, "This Spanish type of blood 
sausage is called Murcela in Portugal. It can be found in Spanish and 
Latin-American markets, and there are variations: the Andalusian contains 
marjoram, rice and almonds; the Portuguese is flavored with cumin." 
</P>
<P>
In response to the May 31 You Asked About . . . . column on pickled asparagus 
tips, Loretto J. Hulse, a staff writer at the Tri-City Herald in Tri-Cities, 
Wash., sent the following recipe, developed several years ago by the Washington 
asparagus growers. It's very popular in her area. 
</P>
<P>
PICKLED ASPARAGUS 
</P>
<P>
6 to 8 pounds fresh asparagus 
</P>
<P>
6 sprigs fresh dill weed 
</P>
<P>
6 small cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
6 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons mustard seeds 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes, optional 
</P>
<P>
3 cups vinegar 
</P>
<P>
3 cups water 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup pickling salt 
</P>
<P>
Wash asparagus in cold water. Trim length so that spears are no higher than 1/2 
inch from top of pint canning jar. 
</P>
<P>
In each of 6 clean pint-size canning jars that have been kept immersed in hot 
water or 150-degree oven, place 1 dill sprig, 1 garlic clove, 1 bay leaf, 1/4 
teaspoon mustard seeds and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Pack asparagus 
spears, tips down, into jars as tightly as possible, leaving 1/2 inch head 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Bring vinegar, water and salt to boil in saucepan, stirring until salt 
dissolves. Ladle brine over asparagus, leaving 1/4 inch head space. Wipe jar 
rims with clean cloth. Cover with lids, prepared according to manufacturer's 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
Process 10 minutes in boiling water bath. Remove and cool in draft-free place 
12 hours. Check seals. Store in cool dark place. For best flavor, store 6 weeks 
before opening. Makes 6 pints.

MICROWAVE: JUICY SPARERIBS SHORTCUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barbecue spareribs in a microwave? You bet -- and in half the usual time. In 
fact, ribs that have been microwaved are supremely juicy and tender because of 
the microwave's moist method of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
If you like ribs crusty brown, simply finish them off in the broiler or on an 
outdoor grill as we direct in the recipes that follow. 
</P>
<P>
We think you'll agree that barbecue was never more delicious. Certainly it was 
never quicker or easier. 
</P>
<P>
BARBECUED SPARERIBS 
</P>
<P>
3 to 3 1/2 pounds lean spareribs, cut in 1- or 2-rib widths 
</P>
<P>
1 cup barbecue sauce 
</P>
<P>
Place ribs, meatiest side down and overlapping as needed, in microwave-safe 
12x8-inch casserole. Cover with vented plastic wrap and microwave on high (100% 
power) 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
DEAR SOS: Delmonico's Seafood Grille serves an outstanding potato dish that 
looks like a pie. I'd love to surprise my family with these great potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- GRETA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR GRETA: Delmonico's garlic-potato pie would make a terrific accompaniment 
to grilled meats, fish or poultry. 
</P>
<P>
DELMONICO'S SEAFOOD GRILLE GARLIC-POTATO PIE 
</P>
<P>
1 bulb garlic

DEAR SOS: Do you have a recipe for Peanut Butter Cake with peanut butter 
frosting that might have been popular in the '50s or '60s? 
</P>
<P>
 -- D.S. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR D.S.: Yes, we do. And it is an oldie but goodie, going back to the '50s. 
The peanut butter frosting contains cocoa, giving it a special chocolate-peanut 
butter flavor you find in candy. 
</P>
<P>
PEANUT BUTTER CAKE 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 cups sifted cake flour 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Cocoa-Peanut Butter Frosting 
</P>
<P>
Sift together flour, baking powder, soda and salt. Cream butter with peanut 
butter in bowl. Gradually add 1 1/4 cups sugar, beating mixture until light and 
fluffy. Blend in egg yolks and vanilla. Add dry ingredients alternately with 
milk, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. 
</P>
<P>

until whites form soft peaks. Gently fold whites into batter. 
</P>
<P>
Turn batter into 13x9-inch pan that has been greased, then lined on bottom with 
wax paper. Bake at 350 degrees 35 to 40 minutes or until cake tester comes out 
clean. Turn cake onto rack to cool. Remove paper and cool competely before 
frosting. 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa-Peanut Butter Frosting 
</P>
<P>
6 tablespoons cocoa 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup hot water

1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
3 1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
Blend cocoa and water. Beat in peanut butter, vanilla and salt until smooth.

LOW-FAT FRUIT DESSERTS THAT FOOL THE TASTE BUDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Low-fat desserts used to be far less satisfying than the real thing. Not any 
more. These days many low-fat desserts have as much pizazz as a hot fudge 
sundae. 
</P>
<P>
That is one reason low-fat desserts are becoming so popular. Our increasingly 
sophisticated palates are another reason. 
</P>
<P>
Great fruit really requires no embellishment; chilled berries, or sliced 
peaches tossed in a small amount of lemon juice are a fitting finale to any 
summer meal when served in a beautiful bowl. A simple dollop of yogurt with 
light brown sugar makes an inviting garnish. 
</P>
<P>
But things need not be that simple. The following low-fat fruit recipes bridge 
the gap between total simplicity and elaborate preparation. Their low-fat 
status derives from the omission of any cream, egg yolks or butter. 
</P>
<P>
When serving these desserts, be sure to use the best-quality fruit you can 
find. And if you use a combination of fruits and berries, the dessert will be 
attractive to the eye and even more appealing to the palate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I was a child, angel cake has always been my preference. Here, a lemony 
version takes the place of the traditional fat-laden lemon chiffon cake, making 
it a perfect foil for summer's fresh berries or raspberry sauce. Although it's 
delicious unfrosted, the Lemon Yogurt Glaze gives it a festive finish. 
</P>
<P>
FRESH LEMON ANGEL CAKE 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups superfine sugar 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons cake flour 
</P>
<P>
2 cups egg whites 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
Zest of 2 lemons 
</P>
<P>
Lemon Yogurt Glaze, optional 
</P>
<P>
Sift 3/4 cup sugar 3 times. Set aside. Sift remaining 3/4 cup sugar with flour 
3 times. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Place egg whites in 4-quart grease-free bowl. Beat on low speed with mixer 
until frothy. Add cream of tartar and salt. Increase speed to medium and slowly 
add lemon juice. Beat until whites are thick and hold definite shape, but still 
soft and moist, about 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Add 3/4 cup sifted sugar, 1 tablespoon at time, beating well after each 
addition. Increase speed to high. Continue beating until whites have increased 
in volume about fivefold, hold shape, are very thick, shiny and smooth, about 1 
1/2 minutes more. 
</P>
<P>
Gently but thoroughly fold in flour mixture, 1/3 at time. Transfer to 10-inch 
ungreased tube pan. Smooth surface with spatula. Cut through batter in 10 
places to break any large air pockets. 
</P>
<P>
Bake in center of oven at 375 degrees about 35 minutes, until surface is very 
brown and wood pick inserted in center comes out clean. Place sheet of foil 
lightly over top during last 5 minutes, if cake is too brown. Invert on empty 
bottle to cool. 
</P>
<P>
When completely cool, use flexible knife to loosen cake from sides and then 
bottom of pan. Invert onto rack. Cake can be kept at room temperature as long 
as 2 days, well covered, or may be frozen as long as 3 months, wrapped 
airtight. Be sure to thaw at room temperature in wrapping. 
</P>
<P>
Frost with Lemon Yogurt Glaze few hours before serving. Makes 1 (10-inch) tube 
cake, 12 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Lemon Yogurt Glaze 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons nonfat yogurt 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
Combine powdered sugar, yogurt, lemon juice and zest in small bowl until 
smooth. Makes 1/2 cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Smooth and satiny, this processor-made peach and raspberry freeze is 100% 
fruit, and much more satisfying than any sherbet. The raspberry fruit spread, a 
great preserve that is a relatively new product on the supermarket shelves, 
used here and in the fool, is intensely tasty and sugarless, making the freeze 
especially flavorful. The powdered non-fat dry milk gives it a smooth 
consistency without any richness. This is one recipe in which the sugar can be 
eliminated or replaced by an artificial sweetener. 
</P>
<P>
FRESH MELBA FREEZE 
</P>
<P>
4 large peaches 
</P>
<P>
2 to 4 tablespoons sugar, depending on sweetness of peaches 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup fresh raspberries 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons raspberry fruit spread 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup powdered nonfat dry milk 
</P>
<P>
Submerge peaches in boiling water 20 seconds. Remove and peel skin with fingers 
or small paring knife. Halve, pit and cut flesh into 3/4-inch cubes. Arrange in 
single layer on baking sheet lined with wax paper and freeze until solid. 
</P>
<P>
Once frozen, fruit can be used immediately or frozen for several months, 
wrapped airtight. 
</P>
<P>
Place 1/2 frozen peaches and sugar in food processor fitted with metal blade. 
Pulse machine several times to chop fruit, then process continually until 
peaches are minced, then pureed. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Repeat with remaining peaches and sugar. Return reserved puree to workbowl. Add 
raspberries, raspberry fruit spread and dry milk. Process until very smooth, 
about 1 to 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Serve immediately as soft frozen dessert or freeze firm. Makes about 1 quart. 
</P>
<P>
Note: If frozen, remove from freezer 15 to 30 minutes before serving so texture 
is more appealing and mixture softens enough to scoop. If ice crystals form 
during long-term freezing, let soften just to point where mixture can be 
spooned back into workbowl and reprocessed until smooth again. 
</P>
<P>
 This fool features a tart puree of plums with raspberries swirled into a puff 
of whipped egg whites in place of the traditional rich whipped cream. Low-fat 
dessert fans take note: Play it safe by "cooking" the egg whites with a hot 
syrup, making an Italian meringue and thus eliminating the possibility that 
salmonella bacteria, sometimes present in raw egg whites, will harm you. It may 
sound complicated, but it is actually very easy to make. You can substitute 
other fruits for the plums and raspberries; just be sure the cooked fruit puree 
measures 2/3 cup and is very tart. 
</P>
<P>
RED PLUM AND RASPBERRY 'FOOL' 
</P>
<P>
4 medium tart red plums, halved and pitted 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pint plus 24 raspberries 
</P>
<P>
Sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon unflavored gelatin 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup water 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup raspberry fruit spread 
</P>
<P>
2 egg whites 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
Puree plums, 1/2 pint raspberries and 2 to 4 tablespoons sugar, depending on 
tartness of plums, in food processor or blender. Mixture should be very tart. 
Press through fine sieve into non-aluminum saucepan to remove seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Simmer, uncovered, over medium heat until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. 
Remove from heat. 
</P>
<P>
Combine gelatin and 1 tablespoon water. Add to raspberry fruit spread, then 
stir mixture into fruit puree. Refrigerate until chilled. 
</P>
<P>
Boil remaining 3 tablespoons water with 1/2 cup sugar in very small saucepan 
over high heat to soft-ball stage or 240 degrees on candy thermometer (may be 
necessary to carefully tip saucepan to measure syrup with thermometer), about 4 
minutes. As temperature approaches 200 degrees, beat egg whites with mixer 
until stiff, but still shiny and moist. 
</P>
<P>
With mixer running, slowly pour syrup in thin, steady stream into egg whites, 
which will take about 1 minute. Continue to beat meringue until very thick and 
cool (feel exterior of bowl), about 3 more minutes. Stir in vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
To finish, gently fold in fruit puree, leaving slightly swirled. Spoon 1/2 
mixture into 4 long-stemmed goblets, dividing evenly. Dot each with 3 
raspberries. Spoon in remaining mixture. Garnish each with 3 raspberries. Chill 
at least 3 hours or overnight. Makes 4 servings.

CITY STUDIES ELDERLY SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday night voted to direct the the city manager to 
examine ways to continue vital services that have stopped for about 100 
disabled senior citizens because of the state budget impasse. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem David Finkel requested staff to examine options to "keep the flow 
of work going" and to report to the council next week. 
</P>
<P>
Because the governor and Legislature have yet to agree on a budget for the 
fiscal year that began July 1, employees who are paid by the state and work for 
the county are not receiving paychecks. "Those workers aren't going to (the 
senior citizens') homes because they're not getting paid," Finkel said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Commission on Older Americans, individuals who cannot perform 
three of five vital life functions -- sight, movement, and the ability to feed, 
clothe and wash oneself -- qualify for the service.

RECOGNITION FOR TEEN URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County fire officials said this week that they will seek a commendation for a 
13-year-old Malibu girl whose quick thinking may have helped to save the life 
of a propane deliveryman after an explosion at the girl's home. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Izad is said to have helped deliveryman Michael A. Link, 26, jump into the 
family swimming pool, dousing the flames that engulfed him when a gas line 
exploded as he was making a delivery at the home July 10, Battalion Chief Jerry 
Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
Link, who lives in West Covina, was in Sherman Oaks Community Hospital this 
week, recovering from second-degree burns to his face, arms and hands, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Meehan said Lisa ran to the laundry room of the house, where the explosion 
occurred, and directed Link to the pool while her mother, Carol, used water 
from the kitchen sink in a vain effort to douse his burning clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that her ability to think quickly may have saved him from being 
critically burned or even killed," Meehan said.

100 HELP IN CLEANUP EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 100 local volunteers are participating in an effort to clean up Caltrans 
property around the Hollywood Freeway, which they say has become a sanctuary 
for transients and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Starting last weekend and continuing through today, the volunteers are helping 
employees of the state transportation agency clear away huge amounts of 
overgrown brush from the land, around and under the Cahuenga on-ramp to the 
southbound Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The brush had become living quarters for transients and a haven for drug 
dealers to conduct their business, harass neighbors and avoid Los Angeles 
Police Department scrutiny because the area is owned by the state, project 
coordinator Sharyn Romano said. 
</P>
<P>
Also helping were representatives of the city-sponsored Clean and Green 
conservation project, Romano said. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup effort was sponsored by the Holly Park Place neighborhood group and 
the Holly Drivers Neighborhood Watch, said Romano, who belongs to both area 
groups.

SENIOR CITIZEN RIDES TO START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A long-awaited shuttle bus service will begin Monday to provide low-cost 
transportation for senior citizens to senior centers, medical facilities and 
nearby shopping areas. 
</P>
<P>
The three specially built 24-passenger DASH/Hollywood shuttles will run along 
Fountain Avenue and Sunset Boulevard every 30 minutes from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m., 
Monday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
They will make stops at existing bus stops marked with special DASH signs. 
</P>
<P>
The fare will be 25 cents, compared to the more than $1 for a trip on a 
Southern California Rapid Transit District bus. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood-area Councilman Michael Woo said he began efforts to get the shuttle 
system about a year ago after senior citizens complained that they had trouble 
getting around. City transportation officials spent several months determining 
the best routes and how many shuttles were needed, Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle service is open to the general public, in addition to senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said $250,000 in state Proposition A funds earmarked for local transit 
programs will be used to finance the shuttle service. He and representatives of 
seniors' groups will unveil the shuttles today in front of the Hollywood Senior 
Multi-Purpose Center at 6501 Fountain Ave. at 11:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Woo will also host an outing Saturday at DeLongpre Park from 10 a.m. to 2:30 
p.m. to unveil the magenta, white and blue shuttles. Residents are invited to 
attend, obtain route information and enjoy free popcorn.

HEARING ON HOTEL TURNS INTO BATTLE TO TAKE THE PODIUM; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: THE MAYOR, WHO OPPOSES THE PROJECT, IS ACCUSED OF ALLOWING ONLY 
FOES TO SPEAK. THE MEETING DREW ABOUT 500 PEOPLE, WITH 160 SIGNED UP TO SPEAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Restaurateur Michael McCarty and his aides accused the mayor of Santa Monica of 
stacking the "chits" against them at a raucous public hearing Tuesday on the 
fate of a planned luxury beach hotel and community center. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Dennis Zane professed his innocence at the first break in the more than 
five-hour meeting attended by about 500 people, many of them announcing their 
views by wearing bright orange or chartreuse name tags depending on which side 
they favored. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty and his lieutenants stormed to the council table to tell Zane they 
believed that something was amiss. Despite turning in 75 chits, which are 
requests to speak, few people in favor of the plan were called to the podium. 
Zane is also opposed to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
When Zane insisted that he had not rearranged the chits to fit a political 
agenda, McCarty exploded with a common barnyard epithet. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor agreed to reshuffle the small slips of paper to avoid any accusations 
of favoritism. Still, when the hearing broke off about 1 a.m., with about 100 
speakers still unheard, about twice as many anti-hotel speakers -- many of them 
members of the private Sand and Sea Club, which occupies the site of McCarty's 
proposed project -- had been heard as supporters of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will continue July 31, when the Santa Monica City Council will vote 
on the project it has long nurtured through the planning process as the best 
alternative for the parcel of state-owned, city-administered beach now occupied 
by Sand and Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the speakers, dubbed "Chit-Gate" by McCarty's project manager, 
was far from the only excitement at the hearing, which also featured outbursts 
of hissing and booing, mostly from the anti-hotel side. 
</P>
<P>
Colorful speakers were on hand, including the rich, the barefoot and a man who 
said he founded the rock band Devo. Much of the time, the debate seemed to be 
about the club versus the hotel, causing one speaker to implore the council to 
decide the matter on the merits of the project, and not whether the Sand and 
Sea Club could stay a year or two longer. 
</P>
<P>
While much was said, nothing was decided. The City Council will also decide 
July 31 whether to immediately terminate the lease of the beach club, whose 
members were out in force Tuesday night, arguing against such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
The state has said the club must go because it is an inappropriate use for 
public land. McCarty's project, as it has proceeded through preliminary phases 
of the planning process, has been generally regarded as preferable by city 
officials because its community center would provide beach access and other 
amenities to the public, and because the hotel would generate more revenue for 
the city -- an estimated $1 million a year for beaches and up to $2 million for 
other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
With four council members up for reelection in November, the hotel has become a 
political hot potato, but council approval is nonetheless widely expected. 
McCarty, best known as the owner of the celebrated Santa Monica restaurant 
Michael's, has asked the council to place the hotel issue before the voters by 
tying it to one or both competing anti-hotel ballot measures already scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Both initiatives would prohibit the construction of hotels on the beach, but 
one is worded to exempt McCarty's project because it is already in the 
pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) has come out against the hotel as 
environmentally unsound for the beach. State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los 
Angeles) also opposes the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
About 160 people signed up to speak Tuesday night. The city clerk said the 
turnout was the second-highest of the past year, exceeded only by the number 
who sought to speak concerning a development proposal for Santa Monica 
Municipal Airport. The airport project was postponed indefinitely by the 
council early this year in the face of widespread opposition. Leaders of the 
opposition to that proposal included many of those who are fighting McCarty's 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Weingarten was the barefoot speaker. Placing a beach towel on the floor, 
he delivered an ironic monologue about how he supported the hotel as an object 
lesson in how the rich get richer. 
</P>
<P>
"You go out and find a two-bit City Council, have them lease public land for a 
song and dance," Weingarten said. Then you erect an environmentally "obnoxious" 
building "that caters to an exclusive clientele of wealthy individuals at the 
expense of nearly every segment of society and surround it with a thin veneer 
of tangential, illusory benefits." 
</P>
<P>
McCarty contended that the hearing showed who his opponents really are: Sand 
and Sea owner Douglas Badt and members of the club. In 1987, Badt competed with 
McCarty for the right to build a hotel at the site, but the council chose 
McCarty's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty said his opponents were trying to mislead the public with claims that 
the beach would be swallowed up and fenced off if his hotel is approved. 
Instead, he said, 30 acres of beachfront will remain public. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not taking away the beach and giving it to the dreaded $300-a-night 
hotel," he said.

1,000 JUGGLERS SHOW SKILLS AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELSTON L. CARR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old Jason Garfield, of Seattle, likes to be among his own kind, 
and this week he is. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield is one of more than 1,000 jugglers from 50 states and several foreign 
countries expected at the 43rd annual festival of the International Jugglers 
Assn., a five-day event of workshops, performances and competitions being held 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, the opening day of the event, Garfield felt at home among 
the 25 jugglers on the floor of Pauley Pavilion as they practiced their 
routines with a rainbow of clubs, rings and balls cascading above their heads. 
</P>
<P>
At the west end of the floor, near the free-throw line, Garfield's eyes were 
fixed on an invisible point above his head as he juggled seven clubs, which 
look much like bowling pins. His arms and the clubs blurred as he quickened his 
pace to send the blue and gold clubs from his hands into an arc above his head. 
He brought them down -- three in one hand, four in the other -- without a 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield began juggling at age 11. Two years later, he won the junior juggling 
championship in Denver. This year, he has qualified to compete in the senior's 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The festival is the one time of the year that Garfield gets to mingle with 
other jugglers, whose skills range from beginner to advanced. Not only does it 
provide an opportunity to learn from others, but it does wonders for his 
self-esteem. Here, he is understood. 
</P>
<P>
"When I practice in Seattle, I practice by myself at a YMCA . . . and there's 
just these people there stretching, not juggling or anything," he said. "Most 
of them don't like me being there because they think juggling is for clowns and 
circuses and whatever. 
</P>
<P>
"But then I come here and people watch me and they say, 'Wow, you're good.' " 
</P>
<P>
In this country, juggling has evolved beyond its vaudeville and circus roots. 
Festival participants say it is a performance art that nets big fees at 
business conventions and at private parties. Jugglers have entertainment 
careers in nightclubs, on Las Vegas and Atlantic City stages, and as opening 
acts for celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone associates it (juggling) with clowns and circuses," Garfield said. 
"That's something I'd really like to get rid of because I don't plan to be in a 
circus or on being a clown. My goal is to get a steady job on a stage, maybe in 
Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
Still to come in the five-day festival is the senior individual and team 
juggling championship to be held today at 7:30 p.m. at UCLA's Royce Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Joggling," a 4-year-old sport of running and juggling, will be featured at the 
Drake Track Stadium at 10:30 a.m. Saturday. Jogglers will compete in 100-meter, 
one-mile and five-kilometer events, as well as a one-mile relay race. Those in 
the know expect records to be broken for both the 100-meter and the one-mile 
joggling events. The records now stand at 11.9 seconds for the 100-meter and 4 
minutes, 43 seconds for the one-mile event, according to the Guinness Book of 
World Records. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, other contests and demonstrations at Pauley Pavilion will 
start at 1:30 p.m. Representatives from the Guinness Book will document any 
records set at the demonstration. The festival will end with performances from 
world-class professional jugglers in the New Vaudeville Revue at 8 p.m. in 
Royce Hall. All events are open to the public.

UCLA GIVES U.S. GYMNASTICS TEAM A 1-2 PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's Chris Waller and Yefim Furman believe that the Goodwill Games beginning 
Friday will help revive American men's gymnastics, which has been in the 
doldrums since the United States won a gold medal at the 1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Waller, the NCAA high bar champion, is a member of the four-man U.S. team that 
will compete at Seattle. Furman, an assistant to UCLA Coach Art Shurlock, will 
be an assistant for the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
Waller and Furman believe that the Soviet Union, the dominant gymnastics team 
of the 1980s, will be difficult, if not impossible to beat. Both said the 
United States has a good chance of finishing among the top three teams. 
</P>
<P>
Waller, who qualified for the Goodwill team by finishing second in the 
all-around at the U.S. Gymnastics Federation championships in Denver, said that 
the U.S. victory in 1984 was not tarnished because the Soviets did not compete. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team was led by Bart Conner, who finished first in the parallel bars, 
and by former UCLA gymnasts Peter Vidmar, Tim Daggett and Mitch Gaylord. Vidmar 
tied China's Li Ning for first on the pommel horse. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 U.S. team "was as good, if not better, than anyone around and U.S. 
gymnastics was right in there with the rest of the world," Waller said. 
</P>
<P>
Furman, who competed for the Soviet Union in the 1972 Olympics and coached in 
his homeland, later immigrated to the United States. He said that the lag 
resulted in an 11th-place finish for the United States in the 1988 Olympics and 
seventh- and eighth-place finishes in the 1988 and 1989 world championships. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. men gymnasts peaked in 1984, but members of the Olympic-championship team 
gave up competition to capitalize on their success and there "was no 
continuation," Furman said. 
</P>
<P>
Waller said that U.S. gymnasts have worked hard since 1984, but he believes 
that "grass-root programs for training athletes in that period of time" became 
antiquated, but have since improved. 
</P>
<P>
In Waller's opinion, there is nothing old-fashioned about the U.S. Goodwill 
team. "We have a great team, we should be in the top three," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other team members are John Roethlisberger of the University of Minnesota, 
Trent Dimas of the University of Nebraska and Lance Ringnald, a member of the 
1988 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Roethlisberger, whose father, Fred, is the head coach at Minnesota, led the 
Golden Gophers to the NCAA championship this year and finished first in the 
all-around at the USGF championships. Waller said that he admires John 
Roethlisberger because "his strength is consistency" and that Dimas and 
Ringnald are also excellent performers. 
</P>
<P>
Waller said that he, Dimas and Ringnald should make the United States "very 
strong in the high bar." Waller, a native of Mount Prospect, Ill., won the 1990 
NCAA high bar title, and Dimas was the runner-up. At the USGF meet, Dimas and 
Ringnald tied for first in the high bar and Waller was third after his hand 
grip (similar to a baseball batting glove) came loose midway through his 
routine, forcing him to start over. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the team's "routines are more difficult and our techniques are 
better than U.S. gymnasts of the past. I'm encouraged. We have a good team, the 
meet is in the United States, and I think we'll do great and win some medals." 
</P>
<P>
As for his own prospects, Waller said that he feels confident going into the 
games. "If you're not confident, you won't compete well. You'll be looking over 
your shoulder, and you'll fall. I feel like I'm in great shape. I'm just a bit 
fatigued from the long college season." 
</P>
<P>
Furman said that the U.S. team should be "much better" than the one that failed 
to win a medal in the 1986 Goodwill Games. He thinks that Waller, who has 
completed his eligibility at UCLA, is capable of winning medals in the high bar 
and on the pommel horse. Waller won an NCAA title on the pommel horse in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Furman said the Soviet Union has so much depth that it could "put two or three 
teams on the floor, and all of them would be good." 
</P>
<P>
Waller and Furman feel that the United States will benefit because the games 
are in Seattle instead of Europe or Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"The judging (at international meets) is very political, but a lot of Americans 
will be judges (at Seattle)," Waller said. "So that is going to help our 
gymnastics a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Furman said that competing in Seattle "will be our plus. It's like having the 
home-court advantage in a college basketball game." 
</P>
<P>
Waller, 21, underwent heart surgery six years ago to repair a constricted 
aorta, a condition that gave him high blood pressure and made his legs weak. 
Surgeons opened up an artery and later closed it with a patch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His legs became much stronger after the operation. "Four months after surgery, 
my vertical leap was four inches higher than before," he said. A year after the 
operation, he became the youngest gymnast (at 16) to compete in the USGF 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
After the Goodwill Games, Waller and UCLA teammates Scott Keswick and Chainey 
Umphrey will compete for the United States against the Soviets in a meet Aug. 
3-5 in San Jose. Waller said he hopes to continue to compete with the national 
team for two more years and in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Waller said he is grateful that he was able to compete in college gymnastics 
because it "helped me tremendously. I got a lot stronger, physically and 
mentally. 
</P>
<P>
"But I finished (college competition) at a perfect time. I can focus on the big 
(international) meets and be concerned more with doing the more difficult 
routines. When you have a meet every weekend in college, you can't develop new 
tricks."

SANTA MONICA BACK TRIES TO MAKE MOST OF ALL-STAR APPEARANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. A. ADANDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large shelf filled with trophies lines the wall in Mark Harper's apartment, a 
testament to his success on the football field. But the former Santa Monica 
High tailback must re-establish himself as a gridiron standout after an ankle 
injury sidelined him during his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Los Angeles Prep Senior Bowl All-Star Football Classic at Long Beach 
Veterans Stadium might be his best chance to show he's recovered from his 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, his first year on the Santa Monica varsity, Harper was an All-CIF 
Southern Section tailback. He rushed for nearly 1,700 yards and 29 touchdowns. 
Major colleges like UCLA, USC and Tennessee showed interest in him and he 
received three shoe boxes full of letters from schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there was any question that -- based on his junior year 
performance -- he was a legitimate Division I prospect," Santa Monica Coach 
Tebb Kusserow said. "But regardless of how you perform as a junior, you need to 
step on the field as a senior and compete." 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies Harper's problem. As a junior, he played basketball for Santa 
Monica but fractured his left ankle when he landed on another player's foot. 
Over the summer, while the left ankle was healing, he fractured his right 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
He played with the injured right ankle in the 1989 football season's first game 
and scored three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably an indication of his toughness," Kusserow said. "I think he 
was trying to set a positive example for the younger members of our team." 
</P>
<P>
By halftime of the next game, the pain was too great and Harper was forced to 
sit out. Although doctors said the best remedy was to give the ankle some time 
to heal, Harper resumed practice four weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my senior year; I wanted to play," Harper said. "And I felt that I was 
ready to come back." 
</P>
<P>
In practice, he took a pitch, made a cut and accelerated, trying to test the 
strength of his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to go all out and see how much my ankle could take, and it popped on 
me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The broken ankle finished Harper's season. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't accept it," Harper said. "I just wanted to play. I wanted to try 
and accept it, but I couldn't take being hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The major colleges lost interest in him, despite Kusserow's advice to 
recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
"When college recruiters came around I always said to them that he could be a 
real find for them," Kusserow said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Harper did not receive a scholarship from any major university. 
He plans to attend El Camino College and hopes that a strong performance in the 
Senior Bowl will entice recruiters to check him out at his community college 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Pinning his hopes on a game might seem like placing unneeded pressure on 
himself, but Harper has dealt with pressure before. In his junior year, he was 
asked to fill the void left by the graduated Glyn Milburn, who set state 
single-season records for rushing yardage and touchdowns. Benefitting from the 
offensive line that had blocked for Milburn, Harper produced results that were 
startling even to himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised," he said. "I was expecting to come in and just learn the 
position. I didn't know how good my skills were. But after the first game, I 
did good and my confidence level was up. Every game after that, I thought I 
could do good. I stepped up and did the job." 
</P>
<P>
Early results from practice this week indicate Harper is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark looks super," said Robert Garrett, the offensive coach of the South-West 
team. "His cuts are smooth and his acceleration is great. There's no sign of 
the injury." 
</P>
<P>
Harper will share the backfield duties with Crenshaw's Kevin Hicks, 
Westchester's Tim Holliday and St. Monica's Damone Ewell. 
</P>
<P>
"It all depends on the flow of the game," Garrett said. "All I know is I'm 
going to try and get him the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Harper will certainly know what to do when he gets it. 
</P>
<P>
"He demonstrated as a junior that he has a tremendous ability to find the end 
zone," Kusserow said. 
</P>
<P>
Harper is blessed with remarkable physical ability as well. Besides lettering 
in football and basketball he played on the baseball team as a senior and ran 
for the sophomore track team. 
</P>
<P>
But his heart belongs to football and his dreams of playing in Division I have 
not died. Although no college coaches will be at the All-Star Classic -- NCAA 
regulations forbid them from recruiting off-campus during the summer -- Harper 
hopes to show that he is back. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that I can come in and do the job as long as I'm healthy," Harper said. 
"I feel that I've still got it." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the 7:30 p.m. game are $6 for adults, $4 for high school students 
with school ID and $2 for children under 12. . . . The game is being dedicated 
to Kevin Copeland, a Dorsey High wide receiver who collapsed and later died of 
heart failure during a game last season. His family will receive recognition in 
a special ceremony which will include Darian Hagan, a former Locke High player 
and current Heisman Trophy candidate at Colorado. . . . The South-West team, 
for which the Westside players will be competing, has lost four of five games.

DAUGHTER OF BRANDO MAY FACE CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Marlon Brando's daughter, Cheyenne, faces a criminal charge in the French 
territory of Tahiti in the shooting death of her boyfriend in Los Angeles, the 
dead man's father said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the charge could be little more than a legal formality, observers in Tahiti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brando's son, Christian, 32, faces murder charges in Los Angeles for allegedly 
fatally wounding Cheyenne's boyfriend, Dag Drollet, 26, at the actor's Santa 
Monica Mountains estate on May 16. 
</P>
<P>
Drollet's father, Jacques Drollet, said he filed a charge -- the equivalent of 
filing a complaint in this country -- in Papeete, Tahiti, on July 2 against 
Christian Brando for the purpose of allowing French authorities to question 
anyone in Tahiti who might have been present and involved in his son's killing. 
</P>
<P>
Drollet, an influential political figure in Tahiti, said Cheyenne Brando, 20, 
was charged Wednesday, but he said he did not know the specific charge. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters news service reported that Cheyenne Brando was charged with complicity 
to murder Dag Drollet -- a charge tantamount to being an accomplice and 
carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment upon conviction. 
</P>
<P>
However, the examining magistrate in the case, Max Gatti, refused to confirm 
that any charges had been brought. 
</P>
<P>
Drollet said Gatti questioned Cheyenne Brando for four hours on Tuesday. She is 
not in custody, but has been forbidden to leave the island, Drollet said. 
</P>
<P>
While not confirming that Cheyenne Brando had been charged, Gatti said charging 
a person can be a mere formality under French law. In fact, a person suspected 
of a crime may ask to be charged in order to be able to have an attorney 
present at any questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Gatti said he plans to give information from his investigation to authorities 
in Los Angeles, and that it is possible that Cheyenne Brando could be tried in 
Tahiti independent of her half-brother's trial in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyenne Brando gave birth to a son by Dag Drollet on June 30, shortly after 
arriving in Tahiti from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando has told police he shot Drollet accidentally during a struggle 
after he angrily accused Drollet of "slapping Cheyenne around." Homicide 
investigators said there was no sign of a struggle at the shooting scene. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said Marlon Brando told them that his daughter had suffered 
"psychological problems" following a serious traffic accident and had made 
numerous unfounded allegations in the past against family members. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando's preliminary hearing to determine whether he will stand trial 
for murder in Drollet's killing will begin Monday in Los Angeles Superior 
Court.

CRA HEAD IS SUBJECT OF PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: OFFICIALS ARE LOOKING INTO JOHN TUITE'S HANDLING OF 2 PUBLIC 
RELATIONS CONTRACTS. BRADLEY ASKS THAT POLICE DEPARTMENT ALSO TAKE A ROLE IN 
INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
At Mayor Tom Bradley's request, city officials are exploring allegations that 
John Tuite, executive director of the Community Redevelopment Agency, 
mishandled two public relations contracts, it was learned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A question of bid-rigging has been raised in connection with one contract, 
officials said, adding that they also are attempting to determine whether Tuite 
paid a consultant public funds to promote his own image and that of his family. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Bradley said Wednesday that the mayor has asked the Los Angeles 
Police Department and City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie to investigate 
both matters. Tuite, the spokesman said, has been asked for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor takes the allegations raised concerning Mr. Tuite very seriously," 
the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuite, reached in Chicago where he had traveled to attend a daughter's wedding, 
discounted the allegations and said he intends to give Bradley a full 
accounting next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the matter is totally without merit," said Tuite, who has been in the 
$136,000-a-year job since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said a "whistle-blower" brought the allegations to the mayor's office 
last week. Bradley aides summoned Tuite and another CRA official to a meeting 
to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
James Wood, the board chairman of the powerful public agency that Tuite 
directs, said Wednesday he was confident that Tuite had done nothing wrong. He 
said that he and other agency officials were in the process of preparing a 
response, also at the mayor's request. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA, with a budget of about $500 million a year, oversees an array of 
construction projects and was largely responsible for rebuilding downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Comrie confirmed that the mayor referred the matter to him. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor," the city administrative officer said Wednesday, "referred it over 
yesterday. We have been asked to review some allegations concerning John Tuite 
and some public relations contracts." 
</P>
<P>
At issue are contracts with two public relations firms, the Lippin Group and J. 
B. Duff &amp; Co. The publicists were hired even though the CRA employs a 
full-time public relations staff of three. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources involved in the inquiry, one question is whether Duff 
&amp; Co. was hired without competitive bidding and whether agency documents 
falsely reflect that two other people bid unsuccessfully for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Duff, head of J. B. Duff &amp; Co, has held two contracts with the CRA 
since 1988 totaling almost $50,000, according to CRA records. She is paid $95 
an hour plus expenses for public relations work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take some time to unravel whether those two people were 
contacted," Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two bidders listed was Mark Firelli, at the time a free-lance public 
relations consultant, according to CRA documents obtained by The Times. 
However, Firelli told The Times on Wednesday that he never bid on any CRA 
contracts. He added that he telephoned the CRA once about two years ago and 
requested some material on the agency's bidding procedure, but never received 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Duff was selected "based on her known quality of performance and her knowledge 
of the redevelopment process," CRA documents said. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach Duff for comment were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
A January, 1989, work summary by Duff details the efforts she made to promote 
both Tuite and the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
One entry reads: "Interview Tuites to develop media pitch for 
personal/professional profile." The entry discussed efforts to interest the Los 
Angeles Times in articles about Tuite. But the report also discussed efforts by 
Duff to encourage stories in various newspapers on the CRA's work with homeless 
and elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
"The question with Duff," said Wood, "has to do with how she was picked and 
with the scope of her work. Was her work related to Tuite or to the agency?" 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Duff's efforts to persuade newspapers to write stories about him, 
Tuite said, "a personal profile of a head of an agency is not unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Tuite, however, did not respond directly to questions about whether other bids 
were solicited in the Duff matter, but said he would "look into it" when he 
returns to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Lippin contract, officials are looking into an allegation that a 
$25,000 contract was backdated in May to pay for prior work that began in March 
without agency approval. 
</P>
<P>
Agency records indicate that the firm's head, Richard Lippin, is to be paid 
$250 an hour plus expenses for speech writing and consultation about the 
agency's image. An associate in the firm is to be paid $125 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum dated May 21, Tuite stated that he authorized the contract 
without soliciting bids because there was no time to request them. In March, 
Tuite wrote, he had an "immediate need for assistance" in writing a speech he 
was to present to the Los Angeles Headquarters Assn. A version prepared by the 
CRA staff "was not adequate," the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
In the May memo, Tuite described the Lippin Group as "uniquely qualified" to 
communicate CRA concerns "in a more clear and positive manner." 
</P>
<P>
Lippin said Wednesday that thus far, his firm has billed the CRA for $5,000 in 
public relations work that officially started on March 1. He said he had no 
knowledge of any possible backdating of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has no other government clients, Lippin said, but does work in the 
social, community and cultural fields. He said that billing $250 an hour is not 
uncommon for the principal of a public relations firm. 
</P>
<P>
Tuite said Wednesday that he had not ordered the contract backdated and that no 
improper actions were taken. 
</P>
<P>
"There was payment made for services rendered, which is proper," Tuite said. 
"The paper work took longer than anticipated, but certainly they earned the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why Lippin was granted a $250-an-hour contract without the solicitation 
of other bids, Tuite said, "I sought some of the best assistance we could get 
at a time in which we were in need of that assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"I have authority to authorize contracts of a certain amount and I believe I 
operated within those limits," Tuite said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOMEOWNERS SEEK PROBE OF HOW FIRE WAS 
HANDLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of Glendale homeowner associations has asked the state to 
investigate whether a countywide force of firefighters responded efficiently to 
a hillside blaze that destroyed 46 homes and damaged 20 others in the city on 
June 27, a spokesman for the coalition said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Some activists have charged that many homes were lost in neighborhoods 
neglected by firefighters until well after the flames had spread. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Homeowners Coordinating Council, representing 15 homeowner 
associations, asked that Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, along with the state 
fire marshal's staff, "conduct a full investigation of all aspects of the fire, 
examining the many unanswered questions that have been raised in the manner in 
which this fire was fought." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Fire Chief John M. Montenero defended the efforts of firefighters.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COURT ASKED TO PREVENT INCORPORATION DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malibu cityhood advocates asked a state appeals court Wednesday to prevent Los 
Angeles County from further delaying the incorporation of the seaside 
community, but the three-judge panel did not give them any encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
The judges were not expected to rule on the matter for several days. 
</P>
<P>
However, their comments clearly favored the county as having the right to delay 
incorporation until March. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not encouraging," said Walt Keller, a member of Malibu's future City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The matter is of crucial importance to the county, which wants to start work on 
a controversial $43-million sewer system in Malibu before a new city government 
has the chance to block it. Voters overwhelmingly approved cityhood last month, 
and all five of the future council members have said they will oppose the 
sewer. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of what the three-judge panel decides, the matter will almost 
certainly be appealed to the California Supreme Court.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURORS IN CAMARENA CASE ASK JUDGE FOR 
MATERIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During their third day of deliberations, jurors in the Enrique Camarena murder 
trial in Los Angeles federal court asked U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie to 
provide them with additional material. 
</P>
<P>
The judge agreed to give the jurors a tape recorder so that they could listen 
to a tape played during the trial dealing with whether defendant Juan Jose 
Bernabe Ramirez was at the Guadalajara house where Camarena was tortured in 
February, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
He also agreed to give them a looseleaf notebook containing photographs of the 
four defendants in the case. The jurors said the photocopies of photographs 
they had been using were unsatisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie denied jurors' request that he re-create the scene in the courtroom on 
the day when a key prosecution witness was unable to identify defendant Javier 
Vasquez Velasco.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACTIVIST GETS MAXIMUM SENTENCE FOR BURGLARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A black community activist who claimed that his prosecution on a burglary 
charge was racially motivated was sentenced Wednesday to three years and eight 
months in state prison, the maximum term possible, for breaking into a Culver 
City beauty shop. 
</P>
<P>
In handing down the sentence, Santa Monica Superior Court Judge James Albracht 
criticized Jitu Sadiki as "a coward" who fabricated an alibi and took unfair 
advantage of minority rights activists who had rallied to support him without 
knowing all the details of the case. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old South-Central Los Angeles man, who was released from prison in 
1982 after serving time for murder, was found guilty of the 1988 burglary by 
two separate juries. He had won a new trial on grounds that he had incompetent 
counsel the first time.

MAN KILLS DAUGHTER, 8, HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Boyle Heights man despondent over breaking up with his wife returned home for 
his birthday party Wednesday, then shot and killed his 8-year-old daughter 
before turning the gun on himself in front of horrified family members, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Bernal, 43, and his daughter, Ruby, were pronounced dead at County-USC 
Medical Center, each of a gunshot wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Bernal's estranged wife, Mary Anne, and two other daughters saw Bernal shoot 
himself, but were not hurt, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those sad, unfortunate things that happens," Lt. Richard Iddings, 
a detective with the LAPD's abused child unit, said. "He had been very 
despondent because of the breakup. . . . You can never judge what despondent 
people will do." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors described the Bernals as a happy couple, with no outward signs of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mary Anne Bernal told detectives of "constant family disputes," but 
did not elaborate, Iddings said. 
</P>
<P>
The two split up a week or two ago, according to police and neighbors, and she 
reportedly spoke of obtaining a restraining order to keep her husband away from 
the two-story apartment building on Marengo Street where the family lived. 
</P>
<P>
But Iddings said there was no indication that Mary Anne Bernal sought the 
restraining order, nor had she begun divorce proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Bernal had been living with a friend in Eagle Rock since the breakup, 
Iddings said. With Bernal's 43rd birthday coming on Wednesday, his wife invited 
him to the apartment for a celebration. Someone had baked cupcakes. 
</P>
<P>
The Bernals and their three children sat and chatted for an hour or so after he 
arrived about 8:30 a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Carlos Bernal took 8-year-old Ruby into a back bedroom "to talk." Minutes 
later, Mary Anne Bernal and the other girls heard a gunshot and rushed into the 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
"And they saw him put the gun to his head and shoot himself," Iddings said. 
"That's when they found the 8-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear why Carlos Bernal, who police said used a .38-caliber handgun, 
chose Ruby. 
</P>
<P>
The other two children, 7 and 12, ran screaming from the apartment to an 
interior patio area, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and ambulances arrived a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
The Bernals managed the apartment building, which sits on a wide street facing 
the San Bernardino Freeway. Neighbors said they were shocked by the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"They were a happy couple, always doing things with their kids," said a woman 
who lives upstairs from the Bernals' unit. She asked that her name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
A 9-year-old girl who used to play with Ruby said the child often spoke of 
missing her father. 
</P>
<P>
"She was his best, best daughter," the girl said.

BLUE LINE RIDERSHIP UP AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ridership on Los Angeles' light rail system increased Wednesday as an estimated 
38,000 passengers, many of them youngsters and families on sightseeing rides, 
took advantage of the Blue Line's free fares and air-conditioned cars. 
</P>
<P>
"We were running extra trains during the midday period and had heavy loads all 
day," said Art Leahy, director of transit operations for the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's 38,000 riders eclipsed the passenger volume on each of the first 
two weekdays of service and raised the total number of passengers to more than 
204,000 since the electric trolleys began operating last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The only problems reported Wednesday were a faulty switch and a 17-minute delay 
for the trolleys that occurred when a Southern Pacific freight train crossed 
their tracks, transit officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were reported on the line Wednesday, they said. 
</P>
<P>
While ridership has surpassed original estimates, the popularity of the Blue 
Line also has caused some headaches for transit officials. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy said several hundred stranded passengers had to be taken from Wardlow 
Station on Tuesday night and bused to downtown Los Angeles after they boarded 
the last scheduled trains from Anaheim Station, despite warnings that those 
particular trains did not run to the end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the people are enjoying this so much that they would really ride the 
train all night long if they could," Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials have credited the free fares for much of the passenger 
volume. The free rides will continue through July 31. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Aug. 1, a flat fare of $1.10 will be charged. RTD monthly bus passes 
also will be honored.

GOLAND CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTING TO HIDE S&amp;L STAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KRENSAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Federal prosecutors Wednesday charged Los Angeles businessman Michael R. Goland 
with conspiring to conceal the ownership of a Santa Monica thrift that he 
acquired using money borrowed from state Sen. Alan E. Robbins (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
Goland, who was sentenced Monday in a separate case for making illegal campaign 
contributions in the 1986 U.S. Senate campaign in California, is charged with 
trying to hide his majority ownership of Viking Savings &amp; Loan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-count indictment charges Goland, 43, and business partner Clifton A. 
Sherwood, 46, of Castro Valley, Calif., with conspiring to secretly purchase 
shares of the thrift for $1.5 million by enlisting 10 friends and business 
associates to pose as independent investors. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Robbins loaned Goland $900,000 to close the deal in 
December, 1986, giving Goland 56.5% ownership of Viking. Robbins, who built 
medical office buildings and apartment buildings before his election to the 
state Senate in 1973, faces no charges in the indictment and "is not a target 
of the investigation," said Assistant U.S. Atty. George B. Newhouse, who is 
prosecuting the case. The indictment was filed in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Goland, Sherwood and their attorneys were unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his office Wednesday evening, Robbins confirmed that he loaned 
Goland $900,000 but declined to describe the reasons for the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was for any surreptitious activities with respect to the savings and 
loan, that was certainly without my knowledge," said Robbins, who added that he 
has worked with Goland in three partnerships developing apartment buildings and 
is still a partner with Goland. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges Goland and Sherwood, former chief executive of Goland's 
Balboa Construction Co., with conspiracy and making false statements to the 
now-defunct Federal Home Loan Bank Board and Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corp. The agencies at the time approved changes in ownership of thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Goland believed that regulators would reject an application to acquire Viking 
that named him as a major shareholder, the indictment charges. Before the 
purchase, Goland had expressed interest in purchasing at least three thrifts in 
Texas, Pennsylvania and California, prosecutor Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
Within two days of acquiring Viking in December, 1986, Goland installed a new 
president and loaned Robbins $100,000, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Viking, then a one-branch thrift on Wilshire Boulevard, was purchased in April, 
1989, by Westside Bank of Southern California. Westside paid $370,130 for 
Viking, which was designated by regulators the month before as a troubled 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Newhouse declined to speculate on Goland's motives for the purchase. The thrift 
could have provided a vehicle for funneling political contributions, because 
S&amp;Ls are subject to looser campaign financing rules. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge Monday sentenced Goland to three months in a "jail-like 
facility" and ordered him to perform 1,000 hours of community service for 
violating federal election laws.

Unexpected increases in food, gasoline and housing costs pushed consumer prices 
up 0.5% in June, nearly double consensus expectations and well above the 
moderate 0.2% monthly inflation of April and May, the Labor Department reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the unforeseen surge in the consumer price index, which brought 
inflation to an annual rate of 5.9% for the first half of 1990 and 4.7% for the 
past 12 months, economists said that the big gains in energy and food should 
abate in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan conceded that last month's inflation 
was "higher than we would like to see." Even so, he said, the economy "is not 
on the edge of either falling apart into a recession or about to take on highly 
inflationary characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to signs of economic slowing and a possible credit crunch, the Fed 
last week eased its grip on the nation's money supply and indicated Wednesday 
that it is willing to allow interest rates to ease further to offset the impact 
of an agreement to reduce the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's unexpected price surge, which was considerably higher than the 
0.3% gain anticipated by private economists, reversed recent declines in energy 
and food prices after weather-related surges earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Food prices increased 0.7% in June, the government reported, after two 
consecutive months of price declines. Economists said the price increase 
reflected efforts by retailers to catch up with earlier jumps in wholesale food 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Ratajczak, an economist at Georgia State University in Atlanta, noted 
that wholesale food prices fell in June, suggesting that grocery store prices 
would moderate in future months. 
</P>
<P>
Gas prices spurted 2.5% in June after falling 1.6% the previous month, despite 
steady wholesale declines in energy prices. As with food, the price gains at 
the pump are expected to decline later on. 
</P>
<P>
"Dealers are taking advantage of a strong driving season when prices normally 
go up," Ratajczak said. "But (wholesale) gasoline and other energy prices were 
down . . . in June, and retailers are getting very good margins right now. So 
that should moderate." 
</P>
<P>
Yet last month's price surge reflects more than just food and energy. Excluding 
those volatile components, the consumer price index still rose 0.4% in June. 
The gain reflects persistent increases in the cost of most services, which 
account for 55% of the index. 
</P>
<P>
Because productivity improvement has lagged in service industries, labor costs 
are higher and inflation has become virtually endemic, said economist Allen 
Sinai of First Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
Medical costs, for instance, were up 0.7% in June after increases of 0.8% in 
each of the previous four months. Medical costs have risen 9% during the past 
12 months and have soared at a 9.4% annual rate during the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
Sinai noted that inflation for goods and commodities other than food and energy 
was only 0.1% in June but that the increase for services was 0.7% 
</P>
<P>
An unexpected source of pain on the service side was a 0.6% increase in the 
cost of housing, which includes taxes and maintenance expenses as well as 
actual house prices. The big jump had been unexpected in view of the continuing 
slump in the real estate market nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Housing was the big surprise here," said Ratajczak. "Obviously it wasn't up 
this much because housing prices are going up because they aren't. But the cost 
of running a home continues to rise." 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Commerce Department said housing construction continued to 
slump last month, with new housing starts tumbling 2.3% in June to the lowest 
level since the 1982 recession. 
</P>
<P>
But the department also reported that applications for new building permits, 
off 3.9% in May, rebounded at the same rate in June, providing a possible early 
hint that the real estate slump may gradually be bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index was pegged at 129.9 in June from a base of 100 in 
1982-1984. That means that an assortment of goods and services that cost $100 
in the base period cost $129.90 in June.

INNOVATION: HOW PRIZES CAN HELP SPUR NEW TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you had to design the dullest, most conventional, most uninspired way to 
encourage creativity and innovation, you'd probably end up with something that 
looks a lot like the Nobel Prize or the MacArthur Foundation "genius grant." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, a Nobel or a MacArthur is lucrative and glistens with a patina of 
prestige and media hype -- but when you get right down to it, these awards have 
all the soul of an accountant and the spirit of an actuary. They serve as 
celebrations of the status quo rather than as challenges to the imagination. 
They confirm what everybody knows instead of getting people to think about what 
they don't know. But the worst thing about them is that, short of pulling names 
out of a hat, they are the laziest possible way to reward creativity. Simply 
get a bunch of big names in a room and have them pick winners as they nosh on 
pate de fois gras. Gosh, it's a tough job, but someone has to do it. 
</P>
<P>
We need prizes that are designed with as much ingenuity and creativity as they 
are intended to reward. Nobels are nifty, but perhaps society could get more 
bang for the buck if prizes encouraged people to focus on solving specific 
problems that they otherwise wouldn't consider. It's not that people shouldn't 
be rewarded for past achievement, but that's not the best way to go. Prizes are 
a wonderful mechanism for capturing attention and imagination; let's treat them 
that way. Look at the history of technology; you'll find that ingenious prizes 
evoke innovative solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody remembers how Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic in 
1927 absolutely galvanized the world and revolutionized the popular perception 
of aviation. What people forget is that the 25-year-old Lone Eagle was gunning 
for the $25,000 Orteig Prize posted by French-born hotelier Raymond Orteig in 
1919. Lucky Lindy wasn't just captured by the romance of a New York-Paris 
crossing; he was also in it for the money. The Spirit of St. Louis may have 
been piloted by an American hero, but it was fueled by a prize. 
</P>
<P>
This tradition of prizes to push the boundaries of technology goes back 
hundreds of years. In 1714, a specially established Board of Longitude promised 
the extraordinary sum of 20,000 pounds to "such person as shall discern the 
longitude by sea" -- absolutely essential, of course, for navigation. It took 
almost 50 years, but a clock accurate enough to solve the problem was built by 
John Harrison in 1762. That device transformed maritime travel. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, when the Napoleonic Wars cut off the Continent's supply of raw 
cotton for textiles, Napoleon promised a huge prize to the inventor who could 
figure out a way to spin linen into fabrics. In 1810, Frenchman Philippe de 
Girard perfected the idea of "wet spinning" -- soaking the raw flax before it 
went to the spindles. (Although quite successful, Napoleon reneged on his 
offer. C'est la vie.) 
</P>
<P>
More recently, prizes have been used to provoke people into thinking about 
problems that have launched whole new genres of technology. Back in 1960, the 
brilliant physicist Richard Feynman concluded his American Physical Society 
Talk, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom," discussing "the problems of 
manipulating and controlling things on a small scale," with not one, but two, 
prize offers. 
</P>
<P>
The first was $1,000 for building a rotating electronic motor 1/64th-inch 
cubed; the second was $1,000 for the first person to put a page of a book in a 
form suitable for reading by an electron microscope. The motor was built that 
same year; the microtext didn't materialize until 1985. The issue, of course, 
wasn't the money -- it was getting people to think about building ultrasmall 
things. These challenges helped launch the discipline of "nanotechnology" -- 
the technology of engineering machines and processes billionths of an inch in 
size. 
</P>
<P>
"Prizes can be very motivating," says Paul MacCready, who runs Monrovia-based 
AeroVironment, an environmental and aeronautical consulting firm. "You put up a 
small prize and 100 times more money gets invested in trying to win it." 
</P>
<P>
MacCready should know. On Aug. 23, 1977, his man-powered Gossamer Condor flew 
into aviation history by traversing a figure-8 course around two pylons half a 
mile apart to win the 50,000-pound Kremer Prize. Established in 1959 by British 
industrialist Henry Kremer, the Prize for Human-Powered Flight had tantalized 
and infuriated aviation enthusiasts as they sought to emulate Icarus without 
getting burned. 
</P>
<P>
What lured MacCready into spreading his wings? "I did the project solely for 
the money," he says. "I had been the guarantor of a $100,000 note that had gone 
sour. Figuring out the pound-to-dollar exchange rate, I suddenly noticed the 
connection between a $100,000 prize and a $100,000 debt. If there had not been 
the prize, I wouldn't have done it." 
</P>
<P>
MacCready, who is also intimately involved with General Motors' efforts to 
develop the electric-powered Impact car, notes that the Kremer Prize was 
magnificently structured to tease the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very rare that you can come up with a perfect prize like the Henry Kremer 
Prize for Human Powered Flight," he says. "It was big; it was absolutely 
impractical -- no inventors could justify spending their own money. I think it 
was a hugely creative prize. You find there are very few prizes like that." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, pointing to the web of interrelated technologies that the Gossamer 
Condor helped spawn, MacCready insists that "if Kremer hadn't come up with his 
prize in the 1950s, there would not be an Impact today. . . . In time, this is 
going to be a winner." 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever these kinds of prizes have been proposed, they've almost always made 
a big difference," says Joel Mokyr, a Northwestern University professor whose 
book, "The Lever of Riches," explores the history of technological creativity. 
"This can be a fantastic idea to spur innovation." 
</P>
<P>
Historically, of course, society relies on the marketplace to generate 
innovation. Obviously, we don't need prizes to get people to seek out a cure 
for AIDS or get clever computer software written -- market forces will take 
care of that. Prizes should be created for problems that the market wouldn't 
take care of, such as human-powered flight or an airborne Atlantic crossing in 
the 1920s. Today, problems like traffic congestion, the management of waste 
products and remedial education seemingly lend themselves to creative prize 
design. 
</P>
<P>
"These impractical prize-driven things have been worthwhile and will become 
even more so," says MacCready. "It changes people's thinking by giving them a 
goal. Changing your perspective is much more potent than just an invention." 
</P>
<P>
What we need are state and local governments -- as well as philanthropists and 
foundations -- to actually sit down and think of creative prizes to help solve 
difficult (or interesting) problems. It's not enough to toss prize money at 
people because you like and admire what they've done -- we need a slew of 
prizes and awards to get people to do new things. Perhaps we should begin by 
offering prizes to people who come up with the best ideas for prizes?

JAPANESE BACK A NEW WILLIAM SIMON VENTURE; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: WITH PARTNER GERALD PARSKY, THE INVESTMENT LEGEND AND FORMER 
TREASURY SECRETARY STRIKES AGAIN.

A huge Japanese insurance concern is putting $100 million in equity into a new 
venture with former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon and partner Gerald L. 
Parsky that will invest in medium-sized real estate projects and corporations 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co. will be a passive long-term investor 
in the partnership with Simon and Parsky. Simon became an investment legend 
through his leveraged buyouts in the mid-1980s, and more recently the two men 
have bought a string of thrifts and banks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time Bill Simon and I have made a relationship with one 
partner for all our activities, and we consider Tokio Marine to be ideal," said 
Parsky, who was an assistant Treasury secretary under Simon from 1974 through 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership, which won't invest in banks or thrifts, will be called WSPG 
Partners LP, and will be based in Los Angeles. Simon and Parsky have until 
recently conducted their activities through WSGP International, which they 
founded in 1986, when Simon decided to give up leveraged buyout investments. 
</P>
<P>
Simon and Parsky will be co-chairmen of the new partnership. Until he stepped 
down this month, Parsky was a senior partner with the Los Angeles law firm of 
Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, where he will continue to be "of counsel." 
</P>
<P>
Tokio Marine operates in 40 countries and last year earned $704 million on 
assets of $58 billion. The partnership will give Tokio Marine an opportunity to 
diversify from its primary business, Parsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe in Mr. Simon's and Mr. Parsky's view of the global marketplace," 
Shunji Kono, president of Tokio Marine, said in a prepared statement. "We have 
confidence in their ability to identify excellent investment opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
While Tokio Marine won't take part in day-to-day decisions, it will help shape 
the partnership's longer-term investment strategy, Parsky said. 
</P>
<P>
For corporate investing, the partnership plans to set up an equity fund over 
the next nine months with a small number of investors from around the world. 
The fund will seek investments in medium-sized companies that it believes offer 
good opportunities for rapid growth. The partnership plans other specialized 
funds as well. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership won't take part in any hostile takeovers, nor will it become 
involved in highly leveraged transactions, Parsky said. He said the concern 
will look for deals requiring a minimum 20% equity investment, rather than the 
highly leveraged transactions that require less than 5% of the investors' own 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership may invest in some companies that have over-leveraged and need 
an equity infusion to improve their balance sheets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
WSGP International has real estate investments worth some $800 million, Parsky 
said. The new partnership will try to avoid the more mainstream commercial real 
estate opportunities -- downtown office space, for example -- in favor of 
specialized investments, Parsky said. 
</P>
<P>
It may buy some properties from thrifts and banks that need to get rid of them 
for regulatory reasons, or because they cannot hold them for all the years they 
require to come to maturity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
WSGP International, in addition to its real estate investments, has interests 
in five thrifts and two commercial banks with combined assets of $10.5 billion. 
Among them are Honolulu Federal Savings &amp; Loan, First Interstate Bank of 
Hawaii and Western Federal Savings &amp; Loan.

New Jersey Fines Trump Plaza: Financially strapped casino king Donald J. Trump 
got some more bad news when his Trump Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino was fined 
$40,000 for violating state gaming regulations. The New Jersey Casino Control 
Commission said between May, 1987, and January, 1990, Financial Director 
Michael Hlavsa and Financial Controller Rodney Ferguson hired six accountants 
who did not have the proper licenses. Acting commission Chairwoman Valerie 
Armstrong said the financial officers falsified paper work that was later 
forwarded to the commission to make it appear the accountants were doing jobs 
that did not require casino licenses.

PEOPLE: SHAD OUT, SAUL IN AS DREXEL CHIEF; BOARD IS REVAMPED

Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, in bankruptcy proceedings, announced Wednesday 
that its board is being reorganized to give outsiders a majority and said John 
S. R. Shad had stepped down as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph S. Saul, a current Drexel board member and former chairman of Cigna 
Corp., was elected to succeed Shad, who will remain on the board as an outside 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel also announced management changes that will consolidate the power of 
John F. Sorte, chief executive of the main brokerage unit, and further reduce 
the role of Frederick H. Joseph, who presided over Drexel during its rise to 
financial power in the 1980s and who negotiated its guilty plea to six felony 
counts. Sorte was named Wednesday to succeed Joseph as president of the parent 
company and was also appointed chairman of the brokerage unit, succeeding Edwin 
Kantor, who becomes a senior executive vice president of the unit. 
</P>
<P>
In late May, Sorte replaced Joseph as chief executive of the brokerage unit. 
Joseph on Wednesday was given a new title as a vice chairman of the parent 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Anreder, a Drexel spokesman, said Sorte has been selected to run Drexel 
if it emerges from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings as a going concern -- an 
issue that is being negotiated with the firm's creditors. "It's a natural 
evolution that he should take over these positions," Anreder said. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February after a cash crisis, 
was owned mainly by its employees. Anreder said the board is being reorganized 
to give outsiders a majority because other creditors currently have a priority 
claim on Drexel's remaining assets. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Sorte said: "This restructuring of the board is 
tangible evidence of our determination to protect the creditors and preserve 
equity values." 
</P>
<P>
Shad, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had been 
brought in as chairman of Drexel after the guilty plea in an effort to bolster 
the firm's image and ensure strict compliance with securities laws. Drexel 
sources have said, however, that Shad never played a very active role on the 
board. In a statement, Drexel said Shad had relinquished his job as chairman 
"because the principal purposes for which he joined the firm have been 
substantially achieved or obviated by the firm's Chapter 11 filing." 
</P>
<P>
Saul, the new chairman, also is a former chairman of the management committee 
of First Boston Corp. and is a former president of the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The changes in Drexel's board will reduce the number of directors to eight from 
nine but will give outsiders a majority of five to three. Drexel said four 
directors are resigning from the board, including Roderick M. Hills, another 
former SEC chairman who was named to Drexel's board at the same time as Shad. 
Drexel said Hills, a partner in the law firm of Donovan Leisure Newton &amp; 
Irvine, resigned because he had discovered an apparent conflict of interest 
between serving as a director and his work for the law firm. Anreder declined 
to give any details of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The other directors resigning from Drexel's board are Robert E. Linton, a 
former Drexel chairman; Howard M. Brenner, a former president of the brokerage 
unit, and Joseph A. Vitanza, the current president of the brokerage unit. 
</P>
<P>
Three new outside directors named to the board are Fletcher L. Byrom, former 
chairman and chief executive of Koppers Co.; Frederick W. Zuckerman, vice 
president and treasurer of Chrysler Corp., and Deborah H. Midanek, a managing 
director at Solon Asset Management Corp. Midanek, a former Drexel employee, had 
been chairman of the Drexel shareholders' committee formed to represent former 
employees and other shareholders in the bankruptcy proceedings. But Drexel said 
she resigned from the committee to assume the seat on Drexel's board.

Newspaper weather pages are more serious, but they can't show you current 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
WeatherBrief ($53) from WeatherBank Inc. of Salt Lake City allows you to get 
up-to-the-minute weather reports and forecasts virtually worldwide, anytime you 
want, with an IBM or compatible personal computer. You will need a modem and a 
color monitor displaying either EGA or VGA graphics, which are two different 
graphic standards set by IBM in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
What you are buying is a sophisticated communications program that lets your 
computer dial into WeatherBank's computer database of weather products and 
retrieve just the ones you want. 
</P>
<P>
The company charges you by the minute for the time that you are connected to 
its computer, at rates ranging from 20 cents to 43 cents per minute, depending 
on when and how the call is placed. You could spend a small fortune if you got 
carried away, which is true of all computer data services. But in just a minute 
or two, you can get a huge amount of information. 
</P>
<P>
The WeatherBrief software makes the information retrieval about as fast and 
efficient as it could be. First, most of the maps and other graphics features 
that you'll see on your screen are actually contained in the software loaded 
onto your PC. The map data that you download (retrieve) from WeatherBank comes 
in the form of overlays for the map outlines that you already have. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, when you receive a map of the current National Weather Service 
radar for the southwestern United States, what you receive is a data set that 
tells WeatherBrief where to overlay precipitation circles on the map and what 
color to make them, indicating light, moderate, heavy or very heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
The program design saves you connect-time charges because you don't have to pay 
to receive fixed data, such as the outlines of the maps, over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
WeatherBrief also automates your connection with the WeatherBank computer. 
Before you instruct your PC to place the call, you run through a selection 
process in WeatherBrief in which you select from its extensive list of products 
just those items that you want to receive. 
</P>
<P>
You could instruct it to just retrieve the latest National Weather Service 
forecast for the West Coast, along with maps showing the chance of 
precipitation and expected windy areas, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
Or you could choose a list up to 300 items long, including a number of custom 
reports prepared by WeatherBank. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what you choose, the WeatherBrief software takes care of actually 
making all the on-line requests for you. You don't have to learn any sign-on or 
other commands. In fact, you never even see them on your screen. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, what you see is a summary of your account for using the service. (It 
costs $25 to open an account, and thereafter you can add to it by 
electronically authorizing credit card charges.) The screen shows the balance 
remaining in your account, the per-minute charge in effect and a rolling 
progress report that tallies data-transfer statistics. 
</P>
<P>
When everything you asked for is received, the computer automatically ends the 
call and then shows you how many minutes and seconds you were connected and how 
much it cost. 
</P>
<P>
The on-line cost depends on whether you use WeatherBank's toll-free 800 number 
or call them long distance at their Salt Lake City number. Connection charges 
for the latter are 20 cents a minute. The long-distance charges will, of 
course, add to that. 
</P>
<P>
If you use the toll-free number, it costs 43 cents per minute weekdays from 8 
a.m. to 5 p.m. Mountain time, 39 cents from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. and 35 cents 
overnight. The lowest rate also applies from 8 p.m. Friday until 8 a.m. Monday. 
Rates are the same whether you have a 300-, 1,200- or 2,400-baud modem, so 
you'll definitely save money with 2,400 baud. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the data is quickly and cheaply obtained. But beware of the satellite 
photos. Because they are digitized pictures, they take a lot of data to 
transfer. And they aren't as clear as you will see on television or in the 
newspaper because of the lower resolution of the computer screen, even with VGA 
graphics. 
</P>
<P>
Some representative sessions: With a log-on time of 3 minutes and 21 seconds, I 
received color radar maps of the Northwest and Southwest for the current hour, 
maps depicting cloud cover for the same areas and maps showing chance of 
precipitation, stated in percent. 
</P>
<P>
Next came maps for the same two areas showing actual precipitation the day 
before and maps forecasting surface winds for the current day. Then there was a 
pair of maps for the entire country, one showing actual high temperatures and 
the other actual low temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
A particularly fascinating map showed me lightning strikes that had occurred 
within the past few moments around the United States. It was even color-coded 
to show whether a strike was from the ground to the clouds or from clouds to 
ground. That map, combined with radar maps, will give a very good indication of 
current storm activity. 
</P>
<P>
I also got the afternoon weather photo from the satellite that focuses on the 
Western United States. It took about as long to receive as the rest of the data 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
Much of that is available on television, especially the Weather Channel on 
cable, but you can get some data that just isn't otherwise available. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, I wanted to know what the weather is like in Alaska, where my 
daughter is camped out for the summer on an ornithology expedition. 
</P>
<P>
It took only a couple of minutes off-line to select the zoned Alaska forecasts 
and latest observation reports that I wanted and 26 cents worth of time on the 
toll-free line to get those reports. The detail was wonderful. I had a table of 
information for 49 Alaska reporting points with current sky, temperature, wind, 
forecast high and low, humidity, barometer and yesterday's high and low 
temperatures and precipitation. (It was cold and cloudy, weather fit for the 
birds, no doubt.) 
</P>
<P>
Among the custom reports that WeatherBank has available are forecasts for the 
major interstate highways. The Interstate 5 forecast went from Tijuana to 
Vancouver, British Columbia, with 10 points along the way. The western portion 
of Interstate 70 carried 11 thumbnail forecasts from Green River, Wyo., to 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever your interest, from aviation to agriculture, maps and reports are 
available to help you cope with the weather. If you also want jokes, cute 
puppies and birthday pictures of the elderly, you'll just have to watch 
television.

ASHTON-TATE POSTS ANOTHER LOSS; SLIDE SEEN CONTINUING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing continuing depressed sales of its flagship personal computer software 
program, Ashton-Tate Corp. Wednesday reported a second-quarter loss of $12.6 
million on a 19% fall in revenue to $48.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Torrance-based company further cautioned that the steep slide 
that began nearly two years ago with the release of an error-riddled version of 
the popular dBase program is not expected to reverse soon. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate President William P. Lyons said that although the company expects 
to release a corrected and updated version of dBase IV soon, he advised against 
expecting an immediate return to previous sales levels and profitability. 
</P>
<P>
The second quarter was the fifth-consecutive period that Ashton-Tate has lost 
money, bringing total losses in the past 15 months to more than $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Losses for the first six months of 1990 totaled $13.5 million, compared to a 
$8.3-million deficit a year ago. Sales were $105.1 million, 30% below the 
$149.3 million recorded a year ago. Second-quarter losses last year were $19.8 
million on sales on $59.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said final testing of the dBaseIV program is under way, the last step 
before the product can be released. However, he repeatedly refused to pinpoint 
when the product will be released for sale.

DOW DROPS 18 ON WORD OF HIGHER PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices tumbled Wednesday in a broad selloff, taking their cue from a 
plunge in the bond market caused by news that June consumer prices jumped an 
unexpectedly strong 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which had closed Monday and Tuesday just 
fractionally below 3,000, dropped 18.07 points to 2,981.68. 
</P>
<P>
Most broader indexes suffered bigger losses. On the New York Stock Exchange, 
declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1, with 483 up, 1,030 
down and 522 unchanged. But volume slowed to 168.76 million shares on the Big 
Board, down from Tuesday's 176.79 million. 
</P>
<P>
Economists had forecast a rise of 0.3% in consumer prices. The higher figure 
sent bond yields soaring, despite positive comments from Federal Reserve Board 
Chairman Alan Greenspan. Testifying on Capitol Hill, Greenspan said despite the 
bad June inflation figure, the Fed would consider further interest rate cuts to 
avert a credit crunch. 
</P>
<P>
"Greenspan hedged his comments too much and it was confusing. The stock market 
did not look favorably on what he said," said analyst Susan Hammargren of 
Geldermann Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"The inflation data suggest inflation is still a problem," said Hugh Johnson, 
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "The market concluded there is 
no room for the Fed to take any more steps toward lower interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said the Dow 30 index's inability to hurdle the 3,000 barrier at 
the close took some steam out of the market. "We hit the wall at 3,000 twice 
and I think that's raised a lot of skepticism on whether we can indeed get 
through 3,000," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
On both Monday and Tuesday, the Dow closed at a record high of 2,999.75. 
</P>
<P>
Still, analysts also noted that the market has been overdue for profit taking. 
Through Monday, the Dow had run up almost nonstop from 2,880 in early July. 
</P>
<P>
Market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Many of the growth stocks that have led the market higher for months were hit 
by profit taking. Losers included Wal-Mart, down 1 3/4 to 33 3/4; Toys R Us, 1 
1/4 to 32 3/4; Home Depot, 2 to 39 5/8; Pepsico, 1 1/8 to 81 7/8, and Gap, 1 
5/8 to 61 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Some growth issues gained, however, suggesting some investors were simply 
rotating money within the group. Showbiz Pizza Time jumped 2 1/2 to 26 1/2 on a 
stronger-than-expected earnings report. Software firm Cadence Design also rose 
on a strong earnings report, up 1 1/2 to 27 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Airline stocks were big losers on fears of weakening earnings, as capacity 
rises next year with the addition of new planes. AMR fell 2 7/8 to 61 5/8 and 
Delta lost 2 3/8 to 73. 
</P>
<P>
* Losers on disappointing earnings reports included home builder Standard 
Pacific, off 1 3/8 to 11 3/4; Reebok, 5/8 to 15 3/4, and Lotus Development, 2 
7/8 to 31 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* United Telecom extended Tuesday's steep drop after reporting 
lower-than-anticipated earnings. It fell 2 1/4 to 27 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Eli Lilly fell 3 7/8 to 85 on concerns over its drug Prozac. A patient sued 
the company for $150 million, claiming that the drug caused her to attempt 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
* Agoura Hills-based American Ecology, a waste-disposal firm, rocketed 2 3/4 to 
8 1/4 on volume of 135,400 shares. The company reported a dramatic turnaround 
in profits in the latest quarter, earning 57 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed lower, breaking a five-day winning streak. The 
225-share Nikkei index slipped 124.17 points to 33,048.11. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times 100-share index fell 13 points to close at 
2,402.0. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, West Gernamy, stocks surged in lively trading as foreign 
investors streamed into the market. The 30-share DAX index rose 37.04 points at 
1,966.04.

Greenspan Speech Fails to Lift Bonds 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices tumbled after the government released the consumer price report for 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost 13/16 point, or about $8.12 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from 
price, jumped to 8.54% from 8.45% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The markets got off to a rocky start when the government said the CPI rose 0.5% 
in June, above expectations. Bond investors fear inflation because it erodes 
the value of fixed-income securities. 
</P>
<P>
James Marshall, a government securities trader at Clayton Brown in Chicago, 
said the market took only moderate comfort in Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan's comments that the Fed would likely continue to ease credit if need 
be to help keep the country out of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Economists questioned several components of Greenspan's testimony before a 
congressional panel, especially remarks that the likelihood of a recession 
"seems low" and that the economy was not experiencing a full-scale credit 
crunch. Those comments seemed to undermine the rationale for the Fed to further 
ease credit. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 7.938% late Wednesday, down from 8% Tuesday.

Dollar Ends Higher in Volatile Session 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended slightly higher against most foreign currencies after a 
volatile trading session marked by conflicting views about the direction of 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gold fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current 
delivery settled at $361.60 an ounce, down 40 cents from Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell to a closing 147.25 Japanese yen from 148.20 yen at Tuesday's close. It 
then traded at 147.45 yen in London, and at 147.77 in New York.

Coffee Futures Rise on Hot, Cold News 
</P>
<P>
Snow in Chile and a volcano in Guatemala helped boost coffee futures prices on 
New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, near-term gasoline futures plunged while other 
energy futures were mixed. Most pork futures fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Raw coffee futures settled 1.5 to 1.7 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in September up 1.7 cents at 87.95 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee futures rose from the opening bell amid reports of volcanic activity in 
Guatemela that was initially believed to have caused severe damage to that 
nation's coffee crop. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent reports contained lower damage estimates. Esther Eskanasy, analyst 
with Cargill Investor Services, said there could have been no crop damage 
because Guatemalan growers harvested all their coffee earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Eskanasy said coffee futures also were supported by technical buy signals and 
by news that it had snowed in Santiago, Chile, for the first time in many 
years.

HOMEFED CORP. REPORTS $108-MILLION LOSS IN PERIOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blaming deteriorating real estate markets in California and other states, 
HomeFed Corp. on Wednesday reported a $108-million loss for the second quarter 
after adding sharply to its loan-loss reserves. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego-based parent of HomeFed Bank also said it will shut down 
virtually all of its loan operations outside California except in Nevada 
because of a rising tide of bad loans in other states. At a press conference 
Wednesday, President Robert F. Adelizzi admitted that HomeFed's out-of-state 
"diversification" was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of the loss for the quarter ended June 30, which compares to a 
$28.1-million profit for the same quarter last year, came as a surprise to an 
industry which by and large views HomeFed as one of the industry's 
better-managed thrifts. Thanks to a strong balance sheet, HomeFed's capital is 
still above the minimum levels required by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift analyst Allan Bortel at the Sutro &amp; Co. securities firm said the 
HomeFed loss was "an incredible hit," but added that the S&amp;L "may very well 
be over-reserving . . . to clear the air. Big baths usually work because it 
means that in future periods your loss provisions are negligible." 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the direct result of $234 million in additional loan-loss 
provisions -- which are charges against earnings -- that HomeFed set aside for 
the quarter. Adelizzi said the provisions were warranted after HomeFed's 
nonperforming assets ballooned during the quarter to $708 million, or 3.73% of 
total assets, up from $454 million, or 2.5%, as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
The bad loans were identified during a special review, conducted during late 
May and June, of all HomeFed loans over $2 million. The review was prompted by 
an alarming increase in bad loans in April and May when nonperforming assets 
increased by $40 million and $81 million, respectively. In June, bad loans 
increased by $133 million. 
</P>
<P>
Adelizzi said the loan review was "management driven" and not done at the 
insistence of regulators. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed stock closed Wednesday at $19 per share, down $1.75, in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. Word of the loss was disclosed after the market had closed. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed's misguided foray into out-of-state lending was responsible for most of 
the S&amp;L's problem loans, Adelizzi said. Although only 20% of HomeFed's 
loans are made outside California -- primarily in Arizona, Massachusetts and 
Georgia -- those loans account for 60% of the 212-branch thrift's bad loans. 
About 30% of HomeFed's total loans in Florida, for example, are either in 
default or in foreclosure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed has $19 billion in assets.

WILDLIFE FLOCKS TO LAGOONS, BUT SO DO CHILDREN AND ADULTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Carolyn Lundburg spends every Thursday, plus several other days each month, 
tending a lagoon. The retired homemaker volunteered three years ago to be a 
docent at the Buena Vista Audubon Society's nature center on Hill Street in 
Oceanside. And, though the center didn't open until 18 months ago, she and 
about a dozen others began much earlier to learn all about the wetlands, its 
birds, fish, history and plants. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the center is open, each of them are more than willing to share lagoon 
lore with anyone who's interested. 
</P>
<P>
Five days a week school children, joggers, senior citizens, garden clubs and 
many others go to the center to learn about Buena Vista and later to explore 
its reedy, bird-busy shore. 
</P>
<P>
As with all but one of the six beautiful but delicate North County coastal 
lagoons, visitors to Buena Vista are welcome to watch birds, fish from the 
shore and hike, but are forbidden from putting boats in or personally entering 
the water. It's called "passive activity," versus the activity such as jet 
skiing, water skiing and swimming that is allowed at Agua Hedionda Lagoon, the 
next estuary south of Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Although Agua Hedionda bustles with activity, some lagoons, such as Los 
Penasquitos, offer very little opportunity for recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Access to the lagoons varies for several reasons. Some are private property and 
others are bird sanctuaries or ecological preserves. 
</P>
<P>
Although these boggy borders between land and sea are among the most productive 
ecosystems in existence, they also are among the most endangered habitats in 
the world. On the California coast, 75% of the wetlands have been destroyed in 
fewer than 140 years, some of them turned into cement river channels. 
</P>
<P>
Lagoon preservation goes on daily in San Diego County, and the fight is 
ferocious to protect the wetlands from those who don't understand their value 
or know how to respect them. The public can get involved in protecting lagoon 
life, either independently or through various organizations, such as the 
Audubon Society or Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
For those who are seeking a groomed, park-like setting, lagoons are not the 
place. Though the constantly collecting silt is dredged from some wetlands and 
certain other maintenance is carried out, for the most part, the lagoons are 
left in their natural state. Tangled underbrush and occasionally smelly tidal 
mud flats are inherent to the coastal condition. 
</P>
<P>
Those untamed qualities are exactly what attract visitors such as Ann Severine. 
</P>
<P>
A junior high school counselor and a Sierra Club guide who lives only a few 
blocks from San Elijo, Severine leads evening walks along the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Severine says she relishes the lagoon walks because they offer so much variety. 
"There are wildflowers, and one section is really wooded with eucalyptus 
trees," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Club members and most others who join the walks are dedicated to 
environmental concerns, and many of them like week-night outings that "get them 
off city streets," Severine said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of us do it for the mental break," she adds, explaining that although the 
trails are never far from public roads and at one point cross under the 
freeway, they seem to take hikers far from urban turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who would like to spend more time exploring these fascinating bodies 
of water -- or contributing to the care of a lagoon -- can find plenty of 
opportunities in the following wetland sketches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BUENA VISTA LAGOON 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Buena Vista Lagoon the lone freshwater lagoon in North County, it's 
also the only one to have a permanent nature center to furnish visitor 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Operated by the Buena Vista Audubon Society, the nature center at 2202 Hill St. 
is an excellent place to begin exploring this 220-acre wetland. The displays 
tell about the endangered birds and other wildlife that call the lagoon home. 
On the second Saturday of each month, the center presents a wildlife 
demonstration. For more information or to arrange group tours call 439-BIRD. 
</P>
<P>
Walking east from the center, there are hiking trails, fishing spots and a 
subtle garden of California native plants. The plants blend so well with the 
brush and pussy willows that it is impossible to tell which vegetation grows 
there on its own and which has been added by the docents at the center. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen who ply the shores of Buena Vista hook bluegill, bass, mullet and 
other fish. A state fishing license is required. 
</P>
<P>
Bird-watchers count several hundred migrating waterfowl on the Pacific Flyway, 
and several endangered species make the lagoon their refuge, including the 
least tern, Belding's Savannah sparrow and the light-footed clapper rail. 
</P>
<P>
A "duck landing" or feeding port for webfoot creatures has just been completed 
on the east rim of Buena Vista Lagoon, east of Interstate 5 off Jefferson 
Street. The Lagoon Foundation and the city of Carlsbad joined forces to improve 
conditions and provide parking at what already was an informal rendezvous site 
for ducks and duck-lovers. 
</P>
<P>
What: Buena Vista Lagoon 
</P>
<P>
Where: On the city line between Oceanside and Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Access: From Hill Street, Jefferson Street, and a cul-de-sac of Marron Road 
near California 78. 
</P>
<P>
Activities: Hiking, bird-watching, fishing from shore. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Status: Most of the lagoon is a state ecological preserve and 
efforts to restore the lagoon to its natural condition continue. Environmental 
groups are fighting new commercial construction at the western shore. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AGUA HEDIONDA LAGOON 
</P>
<P>
It's enough to drive a commuter over the median. On almost any sunny day, from 
the freeway, windsurfers, jet skiers and boaters can be seen skimming along the 
shimmering surface of Agua Hedionda Lagoon. From up there on the blacktop, it 
looks like California at its best. And it is, naturally. 
</P>
<P>
Agua Hedionda, owned by San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and leased to the city of 
Carlsbad, is the only North County lagoon where people are permitted to enter 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
Fisherman commonly cast from the shore on the western lagoon near SDG&amp;E's 
Encina electric generating station, but most activity is in the eastern basin 
of the lagoon near I-5. Although there are a private boat launch, a YMCA camp 
and other private facilities on the lagoon, access to the water for boaters and 
most other sporting activities is at Snug Harbor Marina. 
</P>
<P>
Snug Harbor is on the north shore of the lagoon at the end of Harrison Street, 
which can be reached by taking the Tamarack off-ramp from I-5 and turning 
right. Although the marina is on private property, sunny Snug Harbor offers a 
public launch ramp, snack bar and swimming beach. It also has a pro shop that 
sells swim, boating and fishing gear of all kinds, and rents water skis, jet 
skis, and a two-seat water bike called a wave runner. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a vessel on the lagoon requires a city of Carlsbad permit. Annual 
permits are issued by the city, and daily permits can be purchased at Snug 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The east lagoon has been divided into three areas of use: a jet ski corridor 
near Snug Harbor and I-5; a power boat area in the center of the lagoon where 
only motorized vessels are allowed; and finally a passive use section at the 
east end of the lagoon where board sailing, canoeing and fishing from shore are 
permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Department of Fish and Game dedicated an ecological reserve on 
the northeastern shore. 
</P>
<P>
What: Agua Hedionda Lagoon 
</P>
<P>
Where: Carlsbad 
</P>
<P>
Access: Snug Harbor, off Tamarack Drive from I-5. The way is well marked by 
signs. To reach the ecological preserve, take Park Drive off Tamarack. A paved 
walking path from the end of the cul-de-sac soon will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
Activities: Fishing from the western shoreline, water sports and fishing in the 
basin east of I-5. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Status: Siltation continues to fill the lagoon, though parts are 
dredged. A nature reserve has been established, and some restoration has been 
done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BATIQUITOS LAGOON 
</P>
<P>
Batiquitos probably is one of the most misunderstood North County wetlands. 
Stretching majestically from Carlsbad State Beach east to La Costa, it typifies 
the charm that the lagoons bring to the county's northern coastline. 
</P>
<P>
However, its formerly natural shorelines have increasingly been subjected to 
residential and commercial development -- and predictably, this is the subject 
of fierce controversy. The 550-acre wetland is considered one of the most 
endangered in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, alarm spread when the Department of Fish and Game used explosives to 
open the mouth of the lagoon to allow better tidal washing, which would help 
dying fish and improve the nesting areas of several endangered birds. When 
residents saw the water level fall, they assumed something had gone wrong with 
the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
The condition of the lagoon wasn't getting worse, it was getting better, and it 
should improve even more in the decade ahead. 
</P>
<P>
There are long-term plans to preserve Batiquitos. When Hillman Properties 
bought the lagoon from the Hunt brothers of Texas in 1988, the company turned 
over 377 acres of Batiquitos Lagoon to the state, clearing the way for a 
$20-million lagoon enhancement plan. That plan is undergoing environmental 
review now, and work should begin next year. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Hillman will maintain a 100-foot buffer between the lagoon and its 
development, which includes a shoreline golf course, and to include other 
elements in its construction that would protect the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
The builder also is improving a 5-mile path that runs along the north shore, 
and by September the path will have an amphitheater for nature programs, picnic 
tables, benches and signposts along the walk pointing out ecological features. 
</P>
<P>
The natural attractions are considerable, including eucalyptus groves, 
California live oaks and a pickle weed marsh along the lagoon edge that serves 
as home to the disappearing Belding's Savannah Sparrow. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club sponsors regular evening hikes along the shore. For more 
information, call the Sierra Club or check the organization's newspaper, High 
Sierran, for dates, times and meeting location. 
</P>
<P>
What: Batiquitos Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Carlsbad, La Costa area 
</P>
<P>
Access: Trails along the north shore may be reached from Batiquitos Drive on 
the west end, El Camino Real or Arenal Road on the east end. The trail along 
the western basin may be reached from Windrose Circle off Ponto Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Activities: Hiking, nature study and shore fishing only. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Status: Scheduled for restoration in 1991. Environmental reviews 
are now in process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAN ELIJO LAGOON 
</P>
<P>
On a recent walk along the western flats of San Elijo Lagoon, 9-year-old Tarah 
Bons spied the skeleton of a red rock crab, saw a 2-foot-long fish jump fully 
out of the water, and watched a brown pelican fish for his dinner. 
</P>
<P>
She would have seen much more if she had been able to explore the full 530 
acres of San Elijo. Seven species of terns feed on the small fish that thrive 
in the lagoon, as do herons, egrets and other waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
There is no nature center at San Elijo, though there are rangers on duty, and 
group tours can be scheduled by calling the San Diego County Department of 
Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental classes meet at San Elijo Lagoon for at least part of their 
course work. Naturalist Barbara Moore teaches such classes through UCSD 
Extension, MiraCosta College and San Dieguito Adult School. For dates, times 
and other details, check the catalogues of these schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club sponsors evening walks once each month during daylight savings 
time at San Elijo. Non-members are welcome to join. For more information, call 
the Sierra Club or check the club's newspaper, the High Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Welker, supervising ranger at San Elijo says everyone is welcome at the 
lagoon, though rangers soon will start enforcing regulations to keep mountain 
bikes off the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
"It may sound mean," she says, "but this is an ecological reserve for 
endangered plants and animals, and if it comes to a decision between people and 
the environment, the people have to go." 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive nesting areas have been damaged by lagoon users and their pets who 
have strayed from established paths, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the shore birds that nest here have their nests on the ground or only 
a few feet up. Dogs can wreak havoc," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The county sponsors a volunteer corps that patrols the lagoon and watches for 
damage, monitors environmental changes and enforces rules. 
</P>
<P>
What: San Elijo Lagoon 
</P>
<P>
Where: Encinitas, south end 
</P>
<P>
Access: From the end of Rios Avenue or the end of Santa Carina Drive on the 
south side of the lagoon, along El Camino Real near Rancho Serena at the east 
end of the lagoon, and off Manchester near San Elijo Drive on the north side. 
There is a walk-through opening in the gate on Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
Activities: Hiking or fishing from designated trails. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Status: The lagoon has been cut up for duck-hunting ponds, used 
as a dump for processed sewage and other things that caused harm. Few 
ecological studies have been done, but grants have been obtained and research 
will begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGUITO LAGOON 
</P>
<P>
When beach-goers in Del Mar want some rest from the waves, or let small 
children paddle around in a quiet pond, they often settle near the outlet of 
San Dieguito Lagoon, just west of Camino del Mar and the race track. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a perfect expanse of sand on which to build a really big, fancy 
castle. Other than this small body of water, a stream and some marshlands and 
ponds to the east, this is all that remains of the actual lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito Lagoon once was the largest of North County's six wetlands. It has 
been the one most altered by population growth and development. It is also the 
lagoon to which the public has the least access. 
</P>
<P>
Archeological digs indicate that ancient man inhabited the shores more than 
50,000 years ago. But the railroad, Camino del Mar and Jimmy Durante Boulevard 
have been built on filled-in portions, and what once was a 1,000-acre lagoon is 
reduced to about 300 acres. 
</P>
<P>
There are plans now for a San Dieguito Regional Open Space Park, to run from 
Lake Hodges to the ocean, which could offer protection to the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
However, according to San Diego City Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer, who has 
been instrumental in getting the park under way, the regional open space would 
not offer any additional recreational activities on the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
"The lagoon would be the gateway to the San Dieguito River Valley Regional 
Park," Wolfsheimer said, "but, as for recreational activities, there would be 
none. What you would have in this particularly sensitive area is an observation 
station for wildlife, and perhaps a (walking) trail." 
</P>
<P>
Other areas of the park, which is still in the planning and development stage 
and which Wolfsheimer says may take a great many years to complete, will offer 
golfing, horseback riding and plenty of things to do. The size of the park is 
yet to be determined, but 43 miles of the San Dieguito River are being studied, 
and this, in fact, is the watershed for the lagoon itself. 
</P>
<P>
What: San Dieguito Lagoon 
</P>
<P>
Where: Del Mar, near the fairgrounds 
</P>
<P>
Access: From Grand Avenue bridge, Del Mar. Crest Canyon has hiking trails with 
views of the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Activities: Nature study and shoreline fishing, swimming where the lagoon meets 
the ocean west of the race track. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Status: A multijurisdictional organization has been organized to 
plan, manage and acquire the land for a park that includes the lagoon. Some 
earlier, limited restoration was completed by the California Coastal 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOS PENASQUITOS LAGOON 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to Los Penasquitos Lagoon and its neighbor, Torrey Pines State Beach, 
today may be startled to learn that this lovely natural realm very nearly 
became the site of a nuclear power plant. That was 24 years ago, the subject of 
a much earlier environmental dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 385-acre lagoon was spared a nuclear plant, it is still threatened 
by massive construction projects in its flood plain that curtail the water flow 
and bring sand into the marshes and water areas. Since 1984, accidental spills 
of raw sewage into the lagoon have been a problem, closing Torrey Pines State 
Beach at times. 
</P>
<P>
Although bathers sometimes paddle around or play in the sand at the westernmost 
parts of the lagoon where it reaches Torrey Pines beach, that is the extent of 
activity on the lagoon. There are no formal hiking trails, though bird-watching 
is possible from rim roads, including Carmel Valley and Sorrento Valley roads. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, Los Penasquitos has become mostly a "look at" lagoon. The 
best panorama of the estuary -- in fact one of the most impressive views in all 
of California -- is from the Torrey Pines State Reserve and its hiking trails. 
This is a popular spot for painters to set up easels and canvases. The outlook 
from northbound Torrey Pines Road as it drops down to the beach is remarkably 
beautiful as well. 
</P>
<P>
Where: South of Del Mar, but within city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Access: No formal hiking trails. Access from Torrey Pines State Beach parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Activities: Swimming near Torrey Pines State Beach, bird-watching from various 
points along the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Status: Mostly managed as a preserve by the city of San Diego and 
by the state and the California State Coastal Conservancy, though some land is 
privately owned. The lagoon continues to be filled as a result of massive 
earth-moving projects in its watershed.

<P>
For Pam Wilson, life is a Cinderella story -- on and off the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old Orange Glen High School sophomore snared a starring role in the 
Moonlight Amphitheatre's production of "Cinderella" this summer, meaning she 
will wear the glass slippers for the storybook role during the show's 
four-performance run at the outdoor amphitheater in Vista's Brengle Terrace 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
But her Cinderella story actually began years ago -- at the same theater -- 
when 8-year-old Pam was bitten by the show-biz bug during a production of "The 
Music Man." 
</P>
<P>
"My mom saw the audition notice, and she asked me if I wanted to try out," Pam 
recalled. "I only had one line, but I loved it." 
</P>
<P>
From then on, Pam made the rounds of auditions, honing her skills in singing, 
dancing and acting when she wasn't actually using them on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I began voice lessons when I was 9 years old," she said, "and I study tap, 
jazz and a little ballet." 
</P>
<P>
Although playing Cinderella is Pam's biggest role to date, it isn't her first 
crack at the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a big dancing part in '42nd Street' and I played Dorothy in 'The Wizard 
of Oz.' But playing the lead in 'Cinderella' is really great, and I'm very 
excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
Pam was a heavy hoofer in "42nd Street," a tap-happy show based on Gower 
Champion's challenging choreography; it concluded its run at the Moonlight 
Amphitheatre on Sunday. For "Cinderella," her dancing will have a very 
different look. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mostly waltzing and looking glamorous," she said. "But the most difficult 
part of the show is the singing. I have to sing softly, in a very sweet voice 
-- not my own natural voice -- and I have to be meek and timid. 
</P>
<P>
"Cinderella dreams a lot, and in one of my dreams, I dream a whole bunch of 
things," Pam explained. "There's a big song ('In My Own Little Corner') that I 
sing alone. That's hard." 
</P>
<P>
Singing is her strong suit, however, and Pam is hoping that her voice will 
catapult her into the prestigious, New York-based professional school, 
Juilliard. "I'd like to get into college on my singing," she said. "I'm hoping 
to get into Juilliard, but I'll start looking into that in my junior year." 
</P>
<P>
Cinderella director Grace Ann Etcheberria-Jacobs said she believes Pam has a 
good shot at making it professionally. "Pam has a beautiful voice, she's a good 
dancer, and she's a great actress." 
</P>
<P>
"I think with all kids, they need to continue to focus on their goals. They 
have to realize you have to study and learn all the time," she said. "But Pam 
is very good at that. She can go all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Pam is the youngest star in the Moonlight Amphitheatre's Youth Production 
company. "Most of the (cast) are teen-agers, but the leads are older. The 
prince (Tim Flannagan) is 18," Pam said. 
</P>
<P>
Is playing the lead intimidating to a girl who just turned 15? 
</P>
<P>
"No, I've been performing since I was 8," she said. "I tried out for Starlight 
and I was too tall," said Pam, who is 5-foot-7, referring to the Balboa 
Park-based musical theater troupe. "Now I'm waiting until I can get into the 
regular chorus, but you have to be 16." 
</P>
<P>
Pam's willowy good looks will show off nicely in her Cinderella role, but her 
long blond tresses will be transformed when the fairy godmother enters the 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
"I have naturally curly hair," she said, "but I'll be wearing an elegant fall 
for the ball, because you need long hair and perfect curls." 
</P>
<P>
This youth-dominated production is meant to appeal to a younger audience than 
the Broadway musical. "It was first done by grown-ups," Pam said . "We're 
making it for children, so we're emphasizing the fairy-tale (elements) as much 
as possible." 
</P>
<P>
But even before the musical moved into its final rehearsals, this Cinderella 
was casting a spell over young audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Pam made an appearance at the Vista library to read stories to neighborhood 
children. And about 60 eager members of the small-fry set showed up to hear 
their favorite fairy-tale character bring the stories to life.

Some floral designers hate "roundy moundies." Almost anyone who has ever sent 
flowers knows what a roundy moundy is, even if they do not know what those 
traditional little baskets of flowers are called by those florists who loathe 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Roundy moundies usually consist of readily available flowers, including mums 
and baby's breath -- the type of arrangement Merlin Olsen has been hawking in 
Florists' Transworld Delivery ads for years. 
</P>
<P>
"For most shops, (these arrangements) are their bread and butter," said Noel 
Tribbey, a designer for Lion in the Sun Florals Unique in Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't keep the freezers stocked with cookie-cutter arrangements," he said, 
putting the finishing touches on one of the shop's trademark pieces. "We hate 
baby's breath at this shop. . . . We like to use a lot of unusual materials. . 
. . Things you wouldn't usually associate with flower design." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of burdening their arrangements with an abundance of ordinary flowers, 
floral designers -- as they prefer to be called -- often use exotic or tropical 
flowers in sparse, angular arrangements that call special attention to each 
flower's beauty and shape. Some of the flowers Lion in the Sun frequently use 
include ti leaves, orchid stems, bird of paradise, kiwi vine, banana blossoms, 
heliconia, anthurium and succulents. 
</P>
<P>
"Each flower has its own space, with a lot of negative space around it," 
Tribbey said. "The negative space is almost as important as the space that is 
filled by the flower." 
</P>
<P>
Several flower shops in North County produce contemporary designs similar to 
the ones Lion in the Sun specializes in, a style of arranging that shop manager 
John Pavich describes as "perishable art." 
</P>
<P>
"An artist uses paint to make a picture. We use flowers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On average, a Lion in the Sun arrangement costs about $65, which is $35-$40 
more than an arrangement might cost at a traditional flower shop. Pavich says 
about half of the shop's business is producing arrangements for offices, hotels 
and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Their private customers aren't the special-occasion buyers who only frequent 
flower shops once or twice a year. "Our clientele are more floral-oriented as 
far as everyday flower usage goes," Pavich said. 
</P>
<P>
One Del Mar woman orders several Lion in the Sun arrangements from Pavich every 
week. "We constantly have fresh flowers in the home (and) they do beautiful 
work," she said. "(It's) very unique." 
</P>
<P>
Pavich and his designers have visited the woman's home several times to 
familiarize themselves with each room's color scheme. That way, Pavich says, 
arrangements are designed for specific rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Pavich and Lion in the Sun owner Lee Cantley are members of the American 
Institute of Floral Designers, an international organization with about 600 
members. Pavich is on the organization's national board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The association is dedicated to the promotion and recognition of "floral design 
as an art form," said Marsha Wight, AIFD's national coordinator in Baltimore. 
"You're not going to find anything these guys do in an FTD directory." 
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 100 florists working in North County, only six designers in 
four shops have gone through the rigorous application process to become an AIFD 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Tribbey, 30, submitted his portfolio to AIFD earlier this year and will know 
whether he moves on to the next stage of the application process after the 
organization's national symposium in Newport Beach this month. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Tribbey has been doing very well in regional floral 
competitions. He will represent the San Diego Retail Florists Assn. at a 
statewide competition in October. 
</P>
<P>
Tribbey says floral design is a logical extension of his earlier work as a 
sculptor and professional artist. "I look at myself more as an artist than as a 
florist, (but) it is very hard for an artist to make enough of a living to 
support a family," he said. "(Floral design) was the one thing I could do that 
would keep my hands doing art. . . .This way I can express myself artistically 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
Tribbey acknowledges that his current work may not end up standing in a park, 
or in front of an office building -- but it may make it into the lobby.

AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY REMEMBERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As politicians and educators spoke to cameras nearby, Bertha Alicia Gonzalez 
remembered the day six years ago when a crazed gunman stole the lives of 21 
people, including several of her best friends. Gonzalez held her hand to her 
face and cried. 
</P>
<P>
"We pray together, cry together, go to the cemetery together and embrace in 
pain together," said Gonzalez, who has lived in San Ysidro for 30 years. "The 
pain is still there." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez watched groundbreaking ceremonies Wednesday for a memorial at the 
former site of the San Ysidro McDonald's, where James Oliver Huberty committed 
the country's largest single-day mass slaying on July 18, 1984. Huberty killed 
21 people before being shot and killed by police. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people -- relatives and friends of the victims, educators, 
politicians, and the press -- showed up for the morning ceremony, the 
culmination of six years of argument over what should happen to the 
three-quarter-acre site wedged between Interstate 5 and West San Ysidro 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Facing the boulevard, the $50,000 monument -- 21 six-sided granite columns 
arranged symmetrically -- should be completed in six months, according to 
school officials. 
</P>
<P>
The site is now owned by Chula Vista's Southwestern College, which has 
constructed a building for a satellite college behind the spot where the 
monument will stand. 
</P>
<P>
The columns, which will be from 1 to 7 feet tall, represent the massacre 
victims and the resilience of the San Ysidro community, said Dr. Serafin A. 
Zasueta, dean and director of the satellite. The monument was designed by a 
former architecture student at the college, Roberto Valdes Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, for one, is still upset that the city chose to sell the land to the 
college district instead of building a park. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a political manipulation by whoever was involved," said Gonzalez, the 
publisher of Ahora Now, a community newspaper. "It's such a little thing. The 
people who passed away and those who are still living deserve" more. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Hernandez's 11-year-old brother, Omarr, was the first victim to be 
identified after the massacre. At Wednesday's ceremony, Hernandez, 23, recalled 
his memories of that deadly day, when he saw on TV his brother lying on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," he said. "That's all they did, they just showed my 
brother." 
</P>
<P>
Francisca Lopez Aquino told reporters she's glad the site will be part of a 
college. 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK, it's only a little bit, but it's the way we will remember them," said 
Aquino, whose daughter Paulina, 21, died from Huberty's shots. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after the shooting, McDonald's Corp. major shareholder Joan Kroc had 
the building razed and donated the tract to the city. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, the only memorial on the site was a crude clapboard 
structure that bore the names of the victims and eulogies -- in Spanish and 
English -- beside vandals' graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there was division in the small, heavily Latino community over what 
should be built, with some residents favoring a full park and 
interdenominational chapel, while others wished that no reminders of the attack 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
Some local businessmen favored selling the lot, then appraised at $500,000, 
parking spaces for nearby shops and using the proceeds to build a park nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians argued over the land's fate until February, 1988, when the San 
Diego City Council decided by a 5-4 vote to sell it to Southwestern for 
$40,000, about 10% of the original asking price. Proceeds from the sale will 
improve San Ysidro parks. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the deal was a requirement for the college to build the memorial. Half 
of that money has come from private donations. The largest gift was from 
Catellus Development, a $15,000 donation. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Neves-Perman, a San Ysidro schoolteacher who lost three students in the 
massacre, organized the fund raising for the memorial as president of the 
college's board of trustees.

CARLSBAD COASTAL OIL PLAN COULD GET OVERHAUL; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: STRONG CRITICISM FROM THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION IS PROMPTING 
THE CITY TO RETHINK ITS PLAN TO RESTRICT ONSHORE FACILITIES FOR OFFSHORE 
DRILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Carlsbad plan to tightly restrict onshore facilities for offshore oil 
drilling has been sharply criticized by the California Coastal Commission, and 
has prompted the city to reconsider its proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In a 15-page report, the commission staff said the Carlsbad plan was so poorly 
written it could not be enforced, and it threatened to undermine the 
commission's authority to consider energy-producing projects. 
</P>
<P>
The city's so-called Local Coastal Plan "contains extremely subjective and 
restrictive criteria," the staff report said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Carlsbad City Council approved the plan, fearing possible damage 
from onshore refineries, tanker terminals, pipelines, warehouses and other 
facilities to support offshore oil operations. 
</P>
<P>
But, with the commission staff recommending that the plan be rejected, the city 
last week indefinitely removed the plan from the commission's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Wayne, the city's assistant planning director, said Wednesday that the 
City Council probably will consider next month whether to defend the plan, 
rewrite it, make it weaker, or drop it all together. 
</P>
<P>
"First thing, we've got to buy time," Wayne said. "We feel it's sustainable. I 
don't know what we're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
The federal Department of Energy had proposed to lease 76,735 sea-bottom acres 
north of Encinitas and including areas off Carlsbad's coast for offshore oil 
exploration and drilling. 
</P>
<P>
However, President Bush announced last month that his administration has banned 
offshore drilling for the next 10 years, unless there becomes an emergency need 
for more domestic oil. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire coast of California was up for leasing," said Mark Delaplaine, a 
commission energy analyst. "That's now off for 10 years," including drilling 
off Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some Carlsbad city officials and California congressmen are worried that 
the Bush Administration's ban might not be honored by future presidents and 
have asked the House Appropriations subcommittee on the interior to make the 
moratorium into federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) said this week, "President Bush's decision to 
stop drilling activity until the year 2000 was a victory in our long struggle 
to end drilling altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"However, the President's decision does not bind future Democratic or 
Republican administrations," Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne said the ban on drilling leaves Carlsbad wondering what to do with its 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of the Bush moratorium, do you want to withdraw it and resubmit it at 
another time?" Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
But he suggested that it might be wise to have a plan restricting onshore 
facilities in case the ban is lifted after Bush leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush could be in for one term. He's certainly not going to be in for 10 
years," Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, though, the city's plan appears to be going nowhere with the Coastal 
Commission staff. The plan would prohibit onshore facilities unless the City 
Council found that: 
</P>
<P>
* The facilities would pose no danger to life and property in the city. 
</P>
<P>
* The benefits would clearly outweigh the possible adverse environmental 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
* There are no feasible alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
* Allowing the facilities at a particular location clearly outweighs any 
potential harm to public health, safety, peace, morals, comfort, and general 
welfare of the people in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Delaplaine said, "What we had concerns about was vagueness. There were 
undefinable words in the city's proposal. Who knows what the 'morals of the 
people' means?" 
</P>
<P>
The commission's staff suggested the wholesale rewriting of the city's plan. As 
an example, the city sought to require that onshore facilities must pose "no 
danger to life and property." The staff proposed wording that any threat of 
damage or injuries "will be minimized." 
</P>
<P>
The staff also complained the city's standards for onshore facilities were so 
hard to understand that the commission couldn't properly consider the appeals 
of applicants whose proposed facilities might be rejected by Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
With the staff's proposed wording, the city's plan would be "more specific 
(but) it could be argued either way whether it's tougher or not," Delaplaine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It does seem to weaken our position," Wayne said. "It puts more of the burden 
on us than industry." He denied that the plan is too restrictive, saying "it 
doesn't absolutely close the door to onshore facilities. It's tough, but maybe 
it should be tough." 
</P>
<P>
The commission staff said the plan is also flawed because it is inconsistent 
with the state Coastal Act that allows the commission to approve energy 
development, including proposals that depend on onshore support facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Delaplaine said the commission must have flexibility to balance energy 
development and environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of our program is recognition of national energy needs," he said. But 
Carlsbad "would like to balance things in a more self-protecting way." 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope to decide whether to pursue the plan before the 
commission's December meeting in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Outright prohibitions on offshore drilling have been adopted by San Diego 
County, the city of San Diego and Oceanside.

CAMPING OKD ON SANTA ROSA ISLAND; 
</P>
<P>
PARKS: CAMPGROUND WILL OPEN THIS FALL. HUNTERS WILL SHOOT 4,000 WILD PIGS THAT 
HAVE RAVAGED THE ISLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government for the first time will allow campers this fall on Santa 
Rosa Island -- coincidentally while hunters will be killing as many as 4,000 
wild pigs. 
</P>
<P>
No campers have been allowed on the island since the National Park Service 
bought it in 1986. But beginning on an undetermined date this fall, 30 campers 
at a time will be permitted to pitch tents on a grassy plateau on the island's 
southeast side and to hike in restricted areas. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the hunters will be shooting the feral pigs, which have 
ravaged the island, digging roots, eating acorns and plundering bird nests 
since European settlers abandoned the livestock there in 1850, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The eradication effort to be carried out by biologists and National Park 
Service rangers is the first step in a plan to restore most of the island to 
its natural state and to turn it into a rustic resort for up to 500 vacationers 
by the year 2011. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll make sure hunters and campers won't mix," said Mack Shaver, park 
superintendent. "I don't think we'll have so many people that that will be a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Every camper who arrives this fall by boat or lands at the island's only 
airstrip will be personally welcomed by a ranger and directed to the Water 
Canyon campground -- away from areas where hunters are working, Shaver said. 
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of the campground marks the beginning of what Shaver and his 
colleagues hope will become a backcountry operation on the second-largest of 
the six Channel Islands owned by the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
If a proposed plan is approved by federal officials next year, as expected, the 
island would eventually become a haven for tourists with a taste for rustic 
vacations. Visitors would be able to ride horses, kayak, tour a research and 
environmental center and stay in a no-frills bed-and-breakfast inn. 
</P>
<P>
Unrestricted camping and backpacking would also be allowed -- unlike on some of 
the other Channel Islands, officials said. "We don't want people packed 
together like sardines," Shaver said. 
</P>
<P>
Park Service officials only want to develop about 100 acres of the 53,000-acre 
island and plan to maintain the vintage barns of the ranch on the northeast 
portion of the island. 
</P>
<P>
None of the island's dirt roads would be paved under the plan. The 80 workers 
would commute to the island by boat, so schools and other facilities would not 
have to be built. 
</P>
<P>
"Rugged types" will enjoy the services most, Shaver said. "It's truly a 
backcountry island. On Santa Barbara and Anacapa islands you can hear the ocean 
all the time and not forget you're on an island. Here, you can wander back into 
a canyon and get the feeling you're on a continent." 
</P>
<P>
But at least 90% of the island has been ravaged by the pigs, said Kate 
Faulkner, chief of resources management for the National Park Service. They 
have dug up the roots and eaten the acorns from acres of island oaks, 
contaminated streams with their feces and preyed on native ground-nesting 
birds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of trees and other vegetation has resulted in massive erosion, said 
Bill Halvorson, a scientist for the Park Service. On higher clefts of the gray 
rock that stud the craggy island, buckwheat and bright yellow Coreopsis flowers 
grow. The flowers should carpet the canyon walls, but they only grow in steep 
areas where the animals cannot get at them, Halvorson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service will spend between $200,000 and $800,000 in federal funds over 
a three-year period beginning this fall to wipe out the pigs under a state 
mandate to restore native wildlife on the 53,000-acre island. But officials 
believe that the pigs can be killed in 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
In late August, Park Service employees will be flown in from Hawaii to train 
local rangers, who will be taught to look for the pigs by helicopter and shoot 
them from the ground. The carcasses will be used as bait for other pigs or will 
remain to rot into the soil. To butcher and pack the animals on the island 
would be too costly, Shaver said. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service considered other techniques to wipe out the pigs, including 
using pit bulls to hunt them or setting traps, but decided that those methods 
were inhumane or inefficient, Faulkner said. Also, it is against state law to 
bring the pigs to shore alive because they carry a virus. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups, including federal and state agencies as well as private 
organizations, have not objected to the Park Service's plans to shoot the 
animals, Shaver said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Carlson, a Santa Barbara spokesman for The Nature Conservancy, a 
private, nonprofit organization, said the Park Service has achieved a fine 
balance between environmental preservation concerns and animal welfare. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a very, very compelling reason biologically to get rid of the pigs," 
Carlson said. "I really think they've picked the most humane option." 
</P>
<P>
But the leader of another group, Fund for Animals, which is based in 
Washington, suggested that the pigs be neutered to prevent them from 
reproducing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm vigorously opposed to that kind of mass killing," said group founder and 
president Cleveland Amory. "There are people in this world that believe that 
any time you've got an animal problem you can shoot it." 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, the Fund for Animals intervened on San Clemente Island, 
trapping and moving to private ranches about 3,300 goats that Navy 
sharpshooters were about to kill in an effort to preserve natural vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner said neutering the pigs would be difficult because pigs have several 
litters a year, and "the problem is confounding itself while you're working." 
</P>
<P>
The pigs are only part of the problem, Halvorson said. "We still need to get 
the deer and cattle off. It'll take 100 years to bring this back." 
</P>
<P>
Cattle have grazed on the island since 1902 when the firm of Vail &amp; Vickers 
purchased it from the Moore family, which had raised at least 125,000 sheep 
there. Only about 500 cattle graze on the island since the four-year, statewide 
drought forced the Vail family to move about 1,500 cows to the mainland this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Under a purchase agreement with the Vails, the Park Service will allow the 
family to continue running its ranch until the year 2011. But because of the 
state mandate, Park Service rangers must begin now to undo years of damage done 
by the alien animals, Shaver said.

GOOD SAMARITAN SHOT FOUR TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLAKE FONTENAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carpet installer Gary Smith had never met the University City housewife who 
lived in a condominium next to where he was working. But, Wednesday morning, 
when Smith heard her screaming and running from her home, he rushed to her aid. 
</P>
<P>
His good deed cost him dearly. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old San Diegan, described as a part-time law student and "a real 
decent guy," raced after the man suspected of burglarizing the woman's home. 
</P>
<P>
For his efforts, Smith lay gravely injured in Scripps Memorial Hospital 
Wednesday night after two operations, suffering from four bullet wounds fired 
by the burglar as he ran from Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in very critical condition, and he will probably remain that way for the 
rest of the night," hospital spokeswoman Dilene Pulsipher said shortly after 
Smith came out of surgery at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was shot once below the right eye, once in the abdomen and once each in 
his left arm and leg, said Michael Dabney, media coordinator at Scripps. 
</P>
<P>
A team of three doctors operated on Smith for about six hours after the 
shooting, which occurred shortly after 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
According to the woman's husband, she returned to her home in the 7900 block of 
Camino Tranquilo from an errand when the gun-wielding burglar confronted her. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife was just frozen solid for a minute or two," the husband said. 
</P>
<P>
The burglar fled, and the wife ran outside calling for help after she recovered 
from the shock, the husband said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith heard the screams from the second-floor apartment where he was working, 
and he either jumped or ran down to confront the burglar, San Diego Police 
Officer Bob Chorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith caught up with the fleeing man about a block away, and that's when the 
shooting occurred, Chorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"Supposedly, he had just been (carpeting) on the side and he was going to law 
school," the officer said. "From everything I've heard, he was just a real 
decent guy." 
</P>
<P>
The husband said the thief had only escaped with "odds and ends." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have much for them to take," he said. "There was nothing of any 
great value. . . . I don't think we were a very good place to rob." 
</P>
<P>
He described the crime rate in his neighborhood as "average." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here 4 1/2 years, and I've never heard about anything like this," he 
said. "Robbing is one thing, but to shoot someone over something like this . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
The wife declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Police are still looking for the thief, described as white with a light 
complexion and long, thin brown hair. The man is about 22 years old, 
clean-shaven but with an unkempt appearance, is about 5-foot-9 and weighs 140 
pounds, witnesses told police. 
</P>
<P>
He was wearing a gray or blue Windbreaker and a pair of old jeans, Chorney 
said. The weapon was described as a .22-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Chorney offered a mixed message to other people who might become involved in a 
violent encounter with criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Smith may or may not have realized that the man he was chasing had a gun, 
Chorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing when people get involved in things, but we don't know what 
information he had," Chorney said. "Sometimes, people don't realize the danger 
they're getting into in those situations. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting involved is a personal decision. But the world would be a better place 
if we had more Good Samaritans like him." 
</P>
<P>
When a group of neighborhood residents learned about the shooting, they began 
organizing a fund-raising drive to benefit Smith, spokeswoman Pulsipher said. 
The woman's husband said he would contact the man who had helped his wife. 
"Definitely," he said. "But we'll do it privately."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL KEEPS ALIVE THEATER PROJECT FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Funding for the Los Angeles Theatre Center was kept alive this week by the Los 
Angeles City Council, but several council members questioned the city's 
expenditure of nearly $20 million in public funds since the pioneering downtown 
theater first opened in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 9-3 to funnel $750,000 from the Community Redevelopment 
Agency to support the theater's building and operating costs. But even those 
voting in favor of the additional funds cautioned that city subsidies to the 
financially troubled theater must be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Many council members praised the efforts of LATC -- located near Skid Row to 
bring the arts into a troubled area.

PLANNERS SUGGEST ALLOWING RV SALES

<TEXT>
<P>
The Camarillo Planning Commission on Tuesday recommended that the City Council 
amend the municipal code to allow the sales of recreational vehicles, equipment 
and services in areas zoned for limited manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Director Matthew A. Boden said the change was proposed to satisfy a 
party interested in establishing an RV sales facility in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment would require a minimum parcel of 15 acres for such uses. 
</P>
<P>
In another change to city ordinances, the commission recommended that the 
council allow certified farmers markets within the city limits. If the council 
approves the amendment, farmers markets, which are banned in the city, would be 
established. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission also recommended changes to the city's General Plan 
relating to the use, disposal and transportation of hazardous materials. If the 
council approves the changes, the Planning Department would have greater 
control over the location, storage and use of chemicals that are deemed by the 
state to be hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to address these issues at its Aug. 8 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A previously scheduled public hearing relating to a proposed ordinance 
regulating amateur radio antennas was postponed by the commission until Sept. 
4. RUSS CHARVONIA

COLLEGE BOARD TO VOTE ON CONTRACT

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Community College District board will vote next week on a 
contract that was ratified this week by secretaries, maintenance workers and 
other employees. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed three-year contract, ratified by a 4-to-1 margin of the Service 
Employees International Union Local 535 membership, covers more than 400 
district employees who have been working without a contract since July 1, union 
field representative Gregory Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the classified employees, who work at Moorpark, Oxnard and 
Ventura community colleges, are voting union members, Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed contract, employees would receive a 3% pay raise retroactive 
to July 1 and another 3% increase in January, union and district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The district will continue to pay all health insurance premiums -- which had 
been a major issue with the employee group -- until at least July, 1991, said 
Jerry Pauley, associate vice chancellor and the district's chief negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
Then if health insurance premiums increase by less than 20%, employees will get 
a 4% raise. 
</P>
<P>
However, if increases exceed 20%, the difference will be taken from the 4% 
raise. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

DRIVER ADMITS TO 2ND-DEGREE MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Escondido man pleaded guilty Wednesday to second-degree murder in the death 
of a man struck by a car last March in Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Guzman Valle, 25, was charged with killing Alfredo Chavez Sandoval. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old victim, who went by the nickname Freddie, died of head injuries 
when he and another man were struck by the car driven by Guzman. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge William Mudd set sentencing for Aug. 15. Guzman 
faces a maximum sentence of 15 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony from witnesses at an April 26 preliminary hearing, 
Guzman hit two people with his car outside a bar during a dispute over a woman. 
"The car was the deadly weapon," Deputy Dist. Atty. Phil Walden said. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman had also been charged with assault with a deadly weapon upon Cirenio 
Samano, 34, whose leg was broken in the incident, as well as possession of 
cocaine. Those charges were dropped after Guzman pleaded guilty to 
second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Hilda Castillo testified she came out of the bar with Chavez and saw Guzman get 
into his car and drive into a wire fence and another car before hitting the two 
men. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the incident, Guzman was a cook at a Rancho Bernardo seafood 
restaurant, according to court records.

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN DIVER'S DEATH

<P>
The family of a Westlake Village man who drowned in a 1986 diving accident has 
reached an out-of-court settlement with the Thousand Oaks business that 
provided his scuba lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Far West Sports has agreed to pay $450,000 to the family of Thomas Guerin, 49, 
who drowned in about 15 feet of water off Anacapa Island the same day that he 
and two of his children completed a scuba course, said Donald Aldrich, 
president of the company and one of the instructors. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, to be paid by the company's insurer, is not an admission of 
liability by the company or instructors Aldrich and David Haines, Aldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele approved the settlement 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Another lawsuit filed by the family against Learning Tree University, which has 
campuses in Thousand Oaks and Chatsworth and offered the diving course, is 
still pending, Aldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
Guerin, his daughter Kimberly and his son Christopher had been certified as 
divers and were on their first solo dive when the accident occurred, Aldrich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were properly trained," Aldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
"But Guerin panicked or else he had a heart attack. There was some evidence 
that he died of natural causes." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Guerin family could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although Aldrich denied fault in the accident, he said his insurance company 
agreed to the settlement to avoid the possibility of a jury awarding higher 
damages. CAROLYN KUSKY

REDONDO COUNCIL GIVES BALLOT ISSUES INITIAL OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Redondo Beach voters could face a grab bag of ballot questions this fall, 
including term limits for elected officials, campaign reforms, and the size of 
the city's library commission. 
</P>
<P>
Scrambling to meet the county's Aug. 10 deadline for placing propositions on 
the Nov. 6 general election ballot, the City Council tentatively voted Tuesday 
to put five questions to residents. The measures will be considered in final 
form on Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial are a pair of competing measures dealing with term 
limits. One, sought by Councilman Ron Cawdrey, would abolish the existing City 
Charter provision limiting council members and the mayor to a maximum of two 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate beneficiary would be Cawdrey, who is completing his second term 
on the council. He admits his main goal is to get the chance to run for a third 
term next March. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, I can never run again," Cawdrey said during a break in Tuesday's 
meeting. "I like doing this job, and I think I do it well." 
</P>
<P>
A competing ballot question drafted by Mayor Brad Parton, who opposes Cawdrey's 
proposal, would broaden the two-term limit so it applies not only to the 
mayoral and council posts, but also to the city's other elective offices: city 
treasurer, city clerk and city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would bar reelection bids next year by Treasurer Alice De Long, now 
nearing the end of her fourth four-year term, and City Clerk John Oliver, who 
is completing his third term. City Atty. Gordon Phillips would be prohibited 
from seeking a third term in 1993, when his position will come up for election. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions to put the two-term measures on the ballot came in tight 3-2 
votes, with council members Barbara Doerr and Stevan Colin dissenting each 
time. Colin and Doerr said they voted against Cawdrey's measure because they 
firmly oppose abolishing the two-term limit on the mayor and the council. 
</P>
<P>
They said they fought Parton's proposition because the offices of city 
treasurer, city clerk and city attorney require expertise and could suffer if 
they have to have new leadership every eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's city finance, litigation and record-keeping," Colin said after Tuesday's 
meeting. "Their jobs are more specialized than ours. The only way you get 
better in those fields is with experience." 
</P>
<P>
In interviews on Wednesday, De Long, Oliver and Phillips agreed. De Long said 
the job of treasurer, though an elective position, is more akin to a city 
department head than to a policy-maker. Phillips said two-term limits would 
ruin continuity in the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a lawyer four years to understand the job and then they'll 
have to spend the last four years looking for a new one," Phillips said. "It's 
just one of the worst proposals I have yet to see go on a ballot." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said that, because the city attorney job pays less than litigation 
work in the private sector, a key attraction to the post is that a young lawyer 
can make municipal law into a career. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody young and vigorous is going to take a job that can only last eight 
years, no matter how well you perform," he said. "You're going to get people 
with no interest in the job looking for a source of income." 
</P>
<P>
Oliver, the city clerk, said he believes council members are secretly hoping 
for passage of Parton's proposal so they can run for clerk or treasurer when 
they reach the end of their two-term tether. The posts, although lower in rank, 
are full-time positions with higher salary and retirement pay, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They've just created three vacancies for ex-incumbents to run for," Oliver 
said angrily. "If I'm an incumbent, and I can't run for reelection, you can bet 
your 'bippy' I'll run for treasurer or clerk." 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, Parton argued that voters should have the opportunity to 
weigh both measures. A majority of council members -- Cawdrey, Kay Horrell and 
Terry Ward -- agreed. 
</P>
<P>
But Parton said he will campaign hard for the measure to extend the two-term 
limit to all the city's elected officials, arguing that it will benefit city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it holds government more accountable. . . . I believe that change or 
that disruption can be very helpful," he said during the council debate. "If we 
(the mayor and council members) are going to have it, then I think all elected 
officials should have it." 
</P>
<P>
Among the other measures approved for the Nov. 6 ballot are propositions 
requiring the post of mayor pro tem to be rotated among the five City Council 
members and expanding the library commission from five members to seven. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed campaign reform measure includes several provisions. One would 
prohibit contributions from individuals who contract with the city during the 
12 months after an election. Phillips said the language of that measure would 
probably have to be changed to cover donors who already have city contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Another ballot measure would bar elected officials from voting on issues 
affecting contributors who have given them more than $250. A third would 
require candidates to disclose campaign contributions of $50 or more. State law 
calls for candidates to report contributions of $100 or higher. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth provision would require campaign committees spending more than $500 in 
a Redondo Beach election to register with the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council voted unanimously to place the reform package on the 
ballot, there was debate over the provision requiring candidates to report 
contributions of $50 or more. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier version of the proposal called for a $25 reporting limit, but Ward 
and Horrell argued that candidates would be burdened with too much paper work 
if they had to fill out forms for such small contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Said Horrell: "When you start making these things out, boy, let me tell you, 
that takes time."

DA CHECKS CHARGE THAT SCHOOL BOARD VIOLATED BROWN ACT; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: AN ACTIVIST COMPLAINS THAT SOME CENTINELA VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL 
DISTRICT MEMBERS CONDUCTED PUBLIC BUSINESS IN PRIVATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is evaluating complaints 
alleging that Centinela Valley Union High School District trustees have 
violated laws that require school boards to meet in public. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints were filed in March and early this month by community activist 
Nancy Marthens, who alleges that the trustees have been making decisions in 
private -- in violation of the state's Ralph M. Brown Act -- since they were 
elected to the school board last November. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, former board members Ann Birdsall and Aleta Collins said in 
interviews that board President Ruth Morales twice tried to discuss issues in 
private session that legally should have been discussed in public. Although 
Birdsall and Collins mentioned the incidents in public sessions, they said, 
neither of them ever formally complained about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Morales and the current trustees, who have been under fire by some parents and 
community activists for the way they have handled allegations of racism in the 
district, deny that they have ever violated open meeting laws and instead claim 
that they are being harassed by ousted board members and others who harbor 
political grudges. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. James Hickey, who handles Brown Act violation complaints, 
said this week: "We're evaluating the material to determine if indeed a 
criminal violation has occurred. We haven't made the final call of whether 
we're going to further investigate." 
</P>
<P>
Local governing bodies may privately discuss only those issues exempted from 
the Brown Act, including personnel matters, litigation and contract 
negotiations. Intentional violations of the law are considered misdemeanors, 
and elected officials found guilty may be jailed or fined. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Lassen County Board of Supervisors became the first governing 
body ever charged under the 37-year-old Brown Act. However, the charges were 
dismissed in April. 
</P>
<P>
Because investigators must prove an elected official knowingly violated the 
law's requirements before a criminal case is filed, it is far more common for 
citizens and news organizations to pursue alleged Brown Act violations in civil 
court, Hickey said. There, they may seek an order invalidating an action by a 
governing body or prohibiting future unlawful actions. 
</P>
<P>
Marthens, who wrote both complaints, said in an interview last week that she 
did not want to spend money to pursue civil remedies until the district 
attorney's office decides whether to file criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
In her initial complaint, which was accompanied by a petition signed by 13 
people, including Birdsall, Marthens accused the board of violating the Brown 
Act eight times between Nov. 28, 1989, and Jan. 23, 1990. A supplemental 
complaint filed July 7 alleged additional violations in May. 
</P>
<P>
Among the complaints are allegations that the board made policy decisions in 
private, sought additional legal services without discussing the issue in 
public, improperly discussed issues that were not previously posted on the 
agenda and refused to describe in sufficient detail items to be discussed in 
closed session. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the complaint alleges that on Nov. 28, immediately after the three 
new trustees were sworn in, Morales announced the board "would like to become 
more active in the business of the whole school district." Marthens said it was 
unclear when and where the board made that decision, since this was its first 
public meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Marthens said in her complaint that the board's actions indicate a "conspiracy 
to violate the Brown Act." In a letter to the board dated Jan. 30, which was 
attached to the complaint, Marthens also said trustees have violated "the 
spirit and intent of the law" and "have established a pattern" of violations 
under school board policy, the state Education Code and the state Government 
Code. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees and their attorney, Larry Frierson, say none of the board's 
actions have violated the Brown Act. 
</P>
<P>
When the former board was in office, "I remember on numerous occasions finding 
the board members in a threesome, but I never once heard anyone accuse the old 
board of violating the Brown Act," Trustee Pam Sturgeon said. "I breathe, and 
they're telling me I'm violating the Brown Act. The information I'm getting 
from the California School Boards Assn. is we have not violated the Brown Act 
or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
The association's president, Maureen DiMarco, has been advising school board 
members on several issues facing the district, but spokesman Michael Fallon 
said DiMarco declined to comment about what advice, if any, she or other 
association members have provided regarding the Brown Act. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent complaint, Marthens alleged that Sturgeon had polled her 
colleagues on the telephone regarding a letter she wanted to send in response 
to a threatened student walkout in May. Marthens said Sturgeon had told her and 
others of this. Students had staged a series of walkouts in March to protest 
the resignation of a popular black principal and allegations of racism. 
</P>
<P>
In the May 4 letter, which was addressed to Supt. McKinley Nash, Sturgeon told 
him that he was "directed to instruct the administrative and security staff at 
both schools about their responsibilities in maintaining control and order." 
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon said in an interview last week that the letter "wasn't a letter of 
direction, but basically a letter reminding him (Nash) of what our policies 
are." She also said she called not to get her colleagues' approval but to let 
them know she had already sent it. 
</P>
<P>
But Marthens, Birdsall and community activist Virginia Rhodes, all of whom were 
present during the conversation, said in interviews that Sturgeon told them she 
had called her fellow trustees to get a consensus that the letter should be 
sent. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Brown Act, Marthens wrote, Sturgeon should have called 
an emergency session to address the threatened walkout and posted a notice of 
the meeting. The board also should have voted in public on whether the letter 
should be written, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Frierson, the board's attorney, refused to comment directly on Sturgeon's 
letter but said the board has been acting in accordance with the letter of the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
But former trustees Birdsall and Collins say their experiences on the school 
board gave them reason to be concerned that school business is not being 
discussed in the open. 
</P>
<P>
During their tenure on the board, Collins and Birdsall said, Morales had twice 
tried to discuss issues during closed sessions that should have been presented 
in public. 
</P>
<P>
On both occasions, they said, they refused to participate and mentioned the 
incident during the open session. 
</P>
<P>
Birdsall also said Morales had called her at home twice during her tenure -- 
once in 1985 and once in 1987 -- to poll her on a vote. But in both instances, 
Birdsall said, she refused to discuss the issue on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"She called me to see if I would change my mind on a deal or if I would vote a 
certain way, and I said, 'No, I'm not going to discuss this with you because I 
feel that's a violation of the Brown Act,' " Birdsall said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Brown Act does not specifically prohibit polling, phone calls to 
inquire about a vote could be deemed improper if a decision were reached over 
the telephone, said Assistant Atty. Gen. Eugene Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing wrong with calling a person up and saying, 'How are you voting 
on this?' " Hill said. "But to the extent it starts to represent 
decision-making, then you start to get into" Brown Act violations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morales declined to discuss the allegations by Birdsall and Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Although allegations of Brown Act violations have dogged the board since it was 
seated in November, Marthens was the first person to file a formal complaint. 
The election, in which three challengers replaced three incumbent trustees who 
had been strong supporters of Nash, was considered a major upset. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign was marked by allegations that white teachers had been harassing 
minority administrators -- charges that exacerbated racial tension in the 
fast-changing district. In 1989, more than half the students were Latino; 14.8% 
were Anglo; 18.4% black, and 8% Asian. In 1980, 45.6% of the students were 
Anglo. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions came to a head immediately after the election as rumors began 
circulating that the new board members planned to fire Nash and other black 
administrators in the district to satisfy the predominantly Anglo teachers 
union, which had backed two of the challengers. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers said during the campaign that Nash and Crowe were using 
allegations of racism to deflect legitimate criticisms. On the day of their 
swearing in, the board members -- four of whom are Latino -- denied they had 
any plans for an administrative shake-up. 
</P>
<P>
But in early March, when Crowe announced he was resigning because of a lack of 
support from the trustees, some people interpreted his action as proof that the 
board planned to dislodge black administrators. His announcement sparked 
massive student walkouts March 5 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
After months of declining to speak about Crowe's status in the district, the 
board finally voted 3 to 1 last week to reassign him to a teaching position, 
with Sturgeon voting against the reassignment. (One trustee was ill.) 
</P>
<P>
The political backdrop may be significant because sometimes the Brown Act is 
invoked as a way to satisfy political gripes, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
"The extent to which the constituency is satisfied or unsatisfied with the way 
the board operates can find expression in complaints about the Brown Act . . . 
and could be political." 
</P>
<P>
But Rhodes, who signed the petition requesting a criminal investigation, said 
politics had nothing to do with the allegations. "Things have come out at the 
meetings (that) have not been discussed in public forums," she said. "I think 
they are using their closed sessions for things other than they are allowed to 
use them for." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the board can show it has fulfilled the minimum standards set out by 
the Brown Act, she said, it has still engaged in practices that have created a 
perception that deals are being made in the back room and that the board is 
trying to avoid public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes and Marthens have complained that the school board has not been 
videotaping its meetings, a break with past practice. Sturgeon said the board 
stopped taping meetings because of a breakdown in the equipment. Although the 
board is trying to negotiate an agreement with the city of Lawndale to buy new 
video equipment, critics say the board could have done more in the meantime to 
ensure its meetings were taped. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have also attacked a decision by the trustees in May to scale back the 
number of board meetings from two a month to one, the minimum required by law. 
The board made that decision after several meetings were disrupted by the 
audience and had to be adjourned early. But some critics said the disruptions 
were caused by the board's own actions and that meeting less frequently was not 
an appropriate response to criticism.

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Ralph M. Brown Act of 1953, the first in a series of so-called "sunshine" 
laws in California, requires school districts, city councils and other local 
governing bodies to hold their meetings in public. Under the state law, 
citizens have a right to be notified about what actions are to be considered, 
to address their elected officials during meetings and to be present when votes 
are cast. Governing bodies are permitted to meet privately only to discuss 
issues that are exempt from the law, including personnel matters, litigation 
and property negotiations.

<P>
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS: MARQUARDT CO., OPERATING FOR YEARS UNDER A TEMPORARY 
PERMIT, MAKES CHEMICAL BOMB PARTS AND ROCKET ENGINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Environmental activists and local residents urged state health officials 
Wednesday to conduct health risk and other studies before granting a permanent 
operating permit to a Van Nuys defense and aerospace firm that makes chemical 
bomb parts, rocket engines and other products. 
</P>
<P>
Marquardt Co. has applied to the state Department of Health Services for a 
permit that would allow it to continue using hazardous materials such as 
explosive rocket fuel and toxic solvents at its plant at 16555 Saticoy St. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials are reviewing manufacturing processes, hazardous-waste 
handling procedures and emergency response plans at Marquardt, which has 
operated under a temporary permit since 1981. Wednesday's meeting was called to 
solicit public comment on the firm's application for a permanent permit, which 
state officials won't decide on for another year. 
</P>
<P>
Marquardt uses a variety of toxic and flammable chemicals to produce metal 
parts used in steering rockets for the space shuttle and jet engines for the 
National Aerospace Plane project, whose purpose is to develop an experimental 
commercial jet designed to fly 10 times faster and three times higher than 
existing aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The firm also makes parts for binary chemical bombs and cluster bombs, which 
scatter up to 250 smaller bombs when dropped. Human rights and peace activists 
have condemned cluster bombs as particularly inhumane. 
</P>
<P>
The company became embroiled in controversy two years ago after it won a state 
grant to test a process for incinerating toxic materials at its plant. Although 
engineers said no harmful materials would be released into the air, intense 
community opposition forced the firm to cancel the project. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Newmark, a spokeswoman for the Marquardt Coalition, a group of homeowners 
and environmentalists, urged state officials to conduct a health risk 
assessment and commission an independent environmental impact review before 
granting the company a permanent operating permit. 
</P>
<P>
A health risk assessment would attempt to quantify the risks to nearby 
residents of an accidental release of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said that health risk assessments and environmental impact 
reviews are conducted for about 25% to 30% of the hazardous waste facilities 
whose permits they review. But they added that it is too early in the review 
process to say if such studies will be required for Marquardt. 
</P>
<P>
Newmark also said the homeowners group recently received an anonymous letter 
from the wife of a Marquardt worker claiming the firm failed to report 
"explosions and fires and chemical leaks" to city fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
She said the letter writer also claimed Marquardt was building and loading 
chemical weapons at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Zinkan, another spokeswoman for the Marquardt Coalition, said in an 
interview before the meeting that the firm shouldn't be allowed to store rocket 
fuel and other toxic and flammable materials in a populated area such as Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't do this in the middle of suburbia," she said. "Do this in some place 
that's safer or don't do it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Marquardt spokesman Joe Pospichal said the firm stores and uses only about one 
gallon of rocket fuel a week for its engine tests. He said the material poses 
very little threat to local residents. 
</P>
<P>
Pospichal denied that there have been explosions, fires or chemical leaks at 
the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very close relationship with the Fire Department, and we value the 
safety of our employees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pospichal said Marquardt manufactures metal parts for a binary chemical bomb 
known as "Big Eye" under a contract with the Navy. But he said the firm does 
not make or load any chemicals in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so easy to make accusations," he said. "If they really were sincere, it 
wouldn't have been an anonymous letter." 
</P>
<P>
Pospichal also said that the United States and Soviet Union reached agreement 
in June to slash their stockpiles of chemical weapons. He declined, however, to 
say when his firm's contract to produce Big Eye components runs out or when it 
will cease producing them.

PART OF MOUNTAIN GIVEN TO CONSERVANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alarge section of the landmark Ladyface Mountain above Agoura Hills, named for 
the shape of its delicate ridgeline, has been donated to the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy, officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy, a state agency that acquires and preserves land for public use 
in the Santa Monica Mountains, will open hiking trails in the 122-acre site 
donated by Piedmont Development. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to be able to preserve it," said John A. Diaz, a conservancy 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Behrouz Soroudi, a general partner with Piedmont Development, which built a 
hotel and two office buildings at the base of Ladyface Mountain, said his 
company turned over the mountainside land because "it should be preserved for 
people to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
David Anderson, Agoura Hills director of planning, said the land dedication was 
part of an offer Piedmont made to the city when it sought approval in 1984 for 
the hotel and office complex. 
</P>
<P>
The site, valued at $1 million, includes the bulk of the mountainside and 
ridgeline. Anderson said strict Agoura Hills zoning regulations on hillsides 
would have severely limited Piedmont from building on the land that was 
donated. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy has worked since the early 1980s to acquire Ladyface Mountain 
because of its unusual contours and prime hiking location. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy officials said the Piedmont gift is a major step forward. Ten other 
owners, however, hold land on the mountain, but the conservancy also hopes to 
acquire that land. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a foothold and we're going to try to continue," Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts by Piedmont to turn the land over to the conservancy started in 1988, 
but the transaction was delayed for two years because of reluctant development 
company investors, Soroudi said. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are already under way to open the land to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to open a trail up to the first plateau where people can hike up and 
watch the sun set," Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the dedication, all trails were privately owned and were difficult to 
navigate. Conservancy officials expect to build a 2 1/2-mile trail system that 
will be easier for inexperienced hikers to use. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura Hills officials praised the conservancy and the development company for 
contributing to the city's preservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime we can get open space in the city it's appreciated," said Agoura Hills 
Councilman Ed Kurtz. 
</P>
<P>
A city ordinance limits developments to 1,100 feet to preserve the view of the 
mountain. A plan to protect Ladyface and other scenic open space will come 
before the City Council later this month, Kurtz said.

8 REQUEST PAPERS TO FILE FOR OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight prospective candidates for two seats on the Simi Valley City Council and 
the mayor's office have requested nomination papers from the City Clerk's 
office, the first step to running for office in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for a position on the ballot, each candidate must collect the 
signatures of 20 registered voters and submit them to the city clerk's office 
by Aug. 10, said Lucia Alvelais, a city spokeswoman. Monday was the first day 
of the filing period. 
</P>
<P>
Among the first candidates who requested nomination papers Monday was 
Councilwoman Ann Rock, who plans to seek her third term on the five-member 
council, Alvelais said. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred J. Wilson Sr., a political newcomer, is the only candidate so far to 
request papers for the office of mayor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mayor Greg Stratton has not taken out his nomination papers, he is 
expected to run for reelection. Stratton has served as mayor since 1986 and as 
a member of the council since 1979, longer than any other member. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Vicky Howard, whose terms expires in November, is giving up her 
seat to run for county supervisor against fellow council member Bill Davis. 
Davis' term does not expire until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates vying for a seat on the council include Planning Commissioner 
Judy Mikels, 45, who has served on the commission for four years; Harold Fick, 
52, a local businessman who lost his bid for a county supervisor seat in the 
June primary election; community activist John Etter, 45; Chamber of Commerce 
member Sandi Webb, 41; neighborhood activist Marilyn Maurer, 56; and Kenneth 
Wenning. CARLOS V. LOZANO

PETITION DRIVE TO RECALL 2 BURBANK COUNCIL MEMBERS FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The campaign to recall two Burbank City Council members has died after 
organizers failed to gather enough signatures to put the issue on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just dead," Assistant City Clerk Marge Lauerman said Wednesday of the 
petition to recall Mayor Thomas Flavin and Councilman Michael Hastings. 
</P>
<P>
She said organizers did not file the petition with her office by the deadline 
Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Ted McConkey, who started the recall movement along with two other Burbank 
residents in February, said 7,239 signatures were collected since March. The 
petition needed 8,720 signatures -- or 20% of Burbank's 43,600 registered 
voters -- to be placed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
McConkey said he and other organizers were dissatisfied with the performance of 
Flavin and Hastings, particularly their support for development. 
</P>
<P>
Flavin and Hastings could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Flavin said earlier that the campaign against him was "an irresponsible action 
driven by political motives." Hastings accused those seeking the recall of 
being "unprincipled dissidents." 
</P>
<P>
McConkey cited well-financed opposition and lack of media coverage as reasons 
for the petition's failure. "Half the people in this town didn't even know 
there was a recall," he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although he will not organize another recall petition, McConkey said other 
groups in Burbank have contacted him about campaigns of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though this recall did not succeed, this is far from the end of it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The only successful recall of a member of the City Council was in 1954.

MAN CONVICTED ON 14 COUNTS IN STRING OF ROBBERIES, ASSAULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Torrance man accused of committing a series of seven robberies and assaults 
in the South Bay was convicted Tuesday in five of the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Thomas Jones, 27, was convicted on 14 felony counts by a Torrance 
Superior Court jury, which also found him not guilty on five other charges. 
</P>
<P>
Jones could receive up to 50 years in state prison when he is sentenced Aug. 30 
for the crimes, which occurred in late 1988 and early 1989, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Julie Sulman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sulman expressed disappointment that Jones was not convicted in all seven of 
the break-ins and attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Although victims in the two crimes for which Jones was acquitted identified him 
as their attacker, Sulman said jurors told her that they wanted physical 
evidence -- such as fingerprints found at the scene or stolen items located in 
Jones' apartment -- to convict him. 
</P>
<P>
Such evidence was presented in the five crimes of which he was found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' defense attorney, Oksana Bihun, acknowledged to jurors that Jones had 
confessed to the final two robberies in the series, but he argued during the 
trial that police were using Jones to close other unsolved cases. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who served eight years in a Pennsylvania state prison for robbery and 
rape, was paroled to his mother's home in Torrance a few months before the 
first crime. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors convicted Jones on five counts of residential robbery involving adult 
victims, one count of robbery involving a child, four counts of assault, one of 
forcible oral copulation, one of forcible rape and two counts of possession of 
a gun by a convicted felon. 
</P>
<P>
They acquitted him of attempted first-degree murder, one count each of robbery 
and attempted robbery, and two counts of assault. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Sulman told jurors that the series of crimes began in 
Torrance on Oct. 28, 1988, when Mary Ann Knopp was viciously beaten by a man 
posing as a water company salesman. 
</P>
<P>
Knopp identified Jones, but no physical evidence linked him to the crime and 
jurors did not convict him. 
</P>
<P>
The second attack occurred Jan. 9, 1989, when a 22-year-old Manhattan Beach 
woman was beaten, raped and robbed in her family's home. The attacker ransacked 
the house before smashing a typewriter into the woman's face. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jones was acquitted of trying to murder the woman, he was convicted of 
assault with a deadly weapon, rape, oral copulation and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The third crime occurred the next day, Sulman said, when a Gardena woman was 
attacked by a man claiming to be an insurance salesman. During the attack, the 
woman's 5-year-old son startled the man, who fled with a necklace he had yanked 
from her neck. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors acquitted Jones of attempted robbery and assault in that case. 
</P>
<P>
Sulman said the crime spree continued in March, 1989, when a robber pretending 
to be a water salesman tricked a housekeeper into letting him into a Torrance 
home, where he beat and tied up the woman, tied up the 5-year-old girl she was 
caring for and ransacked the house. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was convicted on all charges in that case. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, Jones struck again when he followed a 71-year-old woman into her 
Calle Mayor home in Torrance, tied her up and ransacked her house. He was also 
convicted on all charges in that case. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was arrested on May 18, 1989, as he fled from the scene of the final two 
robberies, involving an elderly Manhattan Beach woman and her elderly male 
neighbor. Jones was convicted of beating the woman with a gun and robbing her, 
and of assaulting the man and firing a gunshot at him.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: UPS PROPOSAL HEADED FOR REJECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A United Parcel Service proposal to build a 23.7-acre distribution center in El 
Segundo has succumbed to city concern that the facility would put too many cars 
on already-crowded streets and intersections in the industrial and office area 
bordering Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously authorized a resolution rejecting the 3-year-old 
proposal Tuesday, after new city traffic studies showed that the center would 
generate 4,174 vehicle trips during the business day. 
</P>
<P>
Morning and evening peak hours would account for more than 600 trips 
respectively, the study said. The report was based on traffic counts at three 
existing UPS facilities, including Gardena. The resolution is expected to be 
approved Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
UPS experts had projected 2,652 daily vehicle trips at the El Segundo facility 
and peak hour counts in the low 400s. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, officials of the firm reiterated its pledge to keep daily 
traffic below the 2,604 level, or pay fines for the excess. The city earlier 
set that amount as an acceptable traffic level for the facility, which was to 
have been built at Sepulveda and Hughes Way to serve the company's growing 
South Bay and Westside business. 
</P>
<P>
'We'll have to sit down and see what are our options," David Shockley, a UPS 
official, said about the vote. 
</P>
<P>
UPS in May angered city officials by raising the possibility of legal action if 
the project were disapproved.

PLEASE, NO MORE MUDSLINGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The June primaries have passed, and thankfully so has the mudslinging! 
</P>
<P>
Why don't today's politicians base their campaigns on their own merits and 
accomplishments rather than the mistakes of their opponents? Give the voters 
what they want: a straightforward campaign that is free from put-downs and 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
When will the politicians figure out that criticizing their opponents will not 
win them an election? 
</P>
<P>
Sang Korman learned this lesson too late and it cost him. Korman ran against 
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) for the Republican nomination in the 21st 
Congressional District. His campaign was typical -- make Gallegly look like the 
bad guy by airing his "dirty laundry." Korman's campaign backfired. Not only 
did he lose the election (receiving only 31.6 % of the vote), it cost him an 
estimated $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, politicians should spend less of their time and money on 
negative campaign tactics and place more of an emphasis on cleaner campaigns.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMMUNITY CENTER URGED AT LIBRARY SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former Wilmington library on West Opp Street would be renovated and 
reopened as a community building under a proposal by Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores. 
</P>
<P>
In a motion to the council Tuesday, Flores proposed that the city refurbish the 
building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, by September and 
begin leasing space to community groups. 
</P>
<P>
Under her plan, the Wilmington Historical Society would receive a five-year 
lease for 600 square feet of the 3,700-square-foot building. The society would 
be charged $1 per year for the space, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' motion also asks that the building be cleaned and painted and that its 
roof be repaired, bathrooms modernized and bookshelves removed. Her proposal 
was referred to the council's Public Works Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The building has been vacant since 1988, when the city opened a new library was 
opened on North Avalon Boulevard.

RESEDA COUPLE SUES BABY-SITTER CHARGED WITH MURDERING THEIR SON

<P>
A Reseda couple whose 9-month-old son died while in the care of a baby-sitter 
who is now charged with his murder filed a Superior Court lawsuit Wednesday 
seeking unspecified monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
The wrongful death lawsuit, filed in Van Nuys Superior Court by Kevin Young and 
Toni Majoy-Young, accuses Debra Suzanne Cummings of intentionally causing the 
death of their infant son, Kevin. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings, 32, a Reseda mother and PTA president, has been charged with 
first-degree murder in Kevin's death and is also under investigation in the 
death of another baby who died in March while in her care. She has pleaded not 
guilty to the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Also named in the lawsuit are Cummings' husband, Michael, and Gladys L. 
Goodall, the owner of the home the Cummings rented, who are accused of 
negligence in Kevin's death, said Dennis M. Walsh, the Youngs' attorney. Debra 
Cummings is also accused of negligence in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings could not be reached for comment. Her attorney, Joe Ingber, did not 
return a reporter's telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
Young, whom Cummings had cared for almost daily for six months, died on June 16 
of skull fractures suffered in Cummings' home the previous day. Cummings told 
police that the baby fell against a coffee table, but a coroner's report said 
the baby appeared to have been hit with a hand or fist. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings, president of the PTA at Shirley Avenue Elementary School in Reseda, 
is under investigation in connection with the March 15 death of a 14-month-old 
baby. Matthew Cooley, of Reseda, lost consciousness while at a park with 
Cummings. His doctor listed the cause of death as an apparent seizure, but the 
boy's mother told police that she became suspicious because the boy had 
experienced seizures only with Cummings.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ellis F. (Bud) Thackery, a longtime director of photography, has died in Los 
Angeles. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
Thackery worked in the film industry for 52 years and was a master of process 
photography, also called rear projection, a method of filming a landscape to 
use as a backdrop on a sound stage. 
</P>
<P>
The Chatsworth resident died Sunday of natural causes, said his 
daughter-in-law, Diane Thackery. 
</P>
<P>
Born Jan. 31, 1903, in Shawnee, Okla., Thackery came to California in the early 
1920s. During the silent film era, he apprenticed as a matte and glass artist. 
In 1935, he began working at Republic Pictures, where he was head of the 
process department and director of photography on 200 films. He was nominated 
for an Academy Award for special photographic effects for "Women in War" in 
1940. 
</P>
<P>
After Republic went out of business in the late 1950s, he worked as a director 
of photography at Universal Studios until his retirement in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his sons, Frank Thackery of North Hollywood and Bill Thackery 
of Fullerton; a daughter, Connie Bellin of Linden, Calif.; a sister, Cora 
Thackery of Fullerton; 12 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A Mass will be celebrated at 10 a.m. Friday at St. John Eudes Catholic Church, 
9901 Mason Ave., Chatsworth, with burial to follow at Oakwood Memorial Park. 
Arrangements were made by Bastian &amp; Perrott Mortuary in Northridge. 
Donations can be made in Thackery's name to the Motion Picture Relief Fund.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Technology Leadership 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 327 to 93, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 4329) 
authorizing nearly $1 billion over three years for programs to keep America a 
leader in technology. The bill reauthorized the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, which regulates weights and measures, and funded government 
research to benefit specific enterprises such as steel. 
</P>
<P>
Its most disputed feature was funding of the Advanced Technology Program, which 
provides federal grants to help entrepreneurs develop new technologies. The 
bill authorized nearly $400 million over three years for ATP, compared to only 
$10 million annually recommended by President Bush, who prefers private funding 
of such ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Robert A. Roe (D-N.J.) said the government "cannot afford to wait one 
minute longer" to keep America competitive with the Japanese and Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) said spending too much on ATP means "trading 
off core research for essentially a new program that in some cases could be 
handouts." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to pass the bill.

Drugs and Driver's Licenses 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 331 to 88, the House adopted an amendment inducing states to 
suspend the driver's licenses of drug criminals. States not doing so would lose 
2% of their federal highway funds. The amendment was attached to a fiscal 1991 
transportation appropriations bill (HR 5229). 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Gene Taylor (D-Miss.) said, "At times we have to forget about things 
like states' rights and address the horrible drug problem in our nation." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) objected to "sort of a blackmail attitude of 
withholding federal highway funds because states do not pass certain laws." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was for the amendment.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 SAFE AFTER PLANE MAKES BELLY LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five passengers on a twin-engine plane escaped without serious injury Wednesday 
when their aircraft lost power and was forced to land in an open field in 
Lancaster, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Cessna 421 Golden Eagle II took off about 9 a.m. from Gen. William J. Fox 
Airfield in Lancaster and immediately began to lose power in both engines, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The crew of a U.S. Air Force medical rescue helicopter that had just taken off 
from the airport saw the plane was having problems and followed, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, piloted by Adam W. Berg, 67, of Panorama City, was headed west and 
flew about three miles from Fox Airfield when both engines shut down. The plane 
landed in a vacant field at 70th Street West and Avenue G, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Ronald Thomason said the plane's landing gear was up when it landed and 
the aircraft skidded about 300 feet on its belly before coming to a stop. The 
passengers did not need any medical help from the crew of the helicopter, which 
also landed in the field. Berg suffered a slight injury to his leg, Thomason 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The propellers, engines and underside of the plane were damaged, and 
authorities said it would have to be removed from the site by truck.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY SIGNS PORTER RANCH AUTHORIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley has quietly signed into law the authorization for 
the Porter Ranch project, the giant commercial and residential complex that he 
once sharply attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley signed the ordinance authorizing the project, to be built in the hills 
above Chatsworth, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Chandler, the mayor's press secretary, said Bradley gave the go-ahead 
because the aspects of it that he had objected to had been remedied. The Los 
Angeles City Council voted 14 to 0 July 10 in favor of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley threatened in December to veto the 1,300-acre project, saying its 
provisions for public transit, low-income housing and recycling were 
inadequate. But within days, Bradley and Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents 
the area, agreed upon a series of amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Although its dimensions were unchanged by the compromise, the project's 
developer, Porter Ranch Development Co., agreed to set aside several hundred 
multifamily housing units for low-income residences, set up a privately funded 
public transit system and reduce the number of parking spaces. The developer 
also made provisions for trash recycling, composting and reuse of some waste 
water. 
</P>
<P>
When fully built over the next 20 years, the project will include 3,395 
residences and 6 million square feet of commercial space, providing 11,000 
housing units and 20,000 jobs.

SUSPECT'S STRIP UPSETS MERCHANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two owners and an employee of a Gaslamp clothing store said Wednesday that they 
plan to file complaints with the San Diego Police Department charging that the 
search of a man arrested last week on suspicion of heroin possession was done 
in poor taste because the man was standing partly nude on a public street. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was able to see this, I'm sure other people could," said Chris Bates, who 
works at The Catwalk, a retail clothing shop in the 700 block of G Street. 
</P>
<P>
The police, he added, "should think about the other people around who don't 
want to see that sort of thing going on." 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred on the afternoon of July 11, when two police officers 
stopped a car for following another vehicle too closely near 6th Avenue and G 
Street. After officers questioned the man and the woman in the car, it was 
discovered that they were parolees, and a search of the man was authorized by a 
parole agent. 
</P>
<P>
Police Officer Phil Stanley, who was involved in the incident, said he never 
asked the man to strip in the street because searches are usually done in the 
privacy of a police station or jail. Stanley said the man apparently thought 
the search was going to be done immediately because his parole agent had 
authorized it. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought we wanted a search right there, so he pulled his pants down and we 
told him, 'No, not right here on the street.' So we pulled them back up and put 
him in the car," Stanley said. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside the car, Stanley said, the man was found to be carrying a bag of 19 
heroin balloons. In a routine pat-down search of the woman in the car, 240 
heroin balloons were found in her possession and more than $1,000 in cash was 
found in her purse, said police spokesman Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
William Rayon, 22, has been charged with transporting a controlled substance, 
and DeAnna Rocha, 24, has been charged with selling a controlled substance, 
jail officials said. Rayon and Rocha, who had been living in a National City 
hotel, are being held on $75,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, along with Ray Campbell and Jeanne Machold, owners of The Catwalk, said 
they will file citizen complaints with the Police Department within the next 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
Bates said the man lowered his pants for about a minute during the police 
search. He also said the police did not fully shield the man's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they were really trying to guard, because they were standing 
more off to the side," Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said the incident disrupted his business. "It's gross that it happened 
right out in front of the store," he said. "It deters people from coming into 
the business." 
</P>
<P>
But Laura Sinclair, who works at Ace Uniforms &amp; Accessories in the 700 
block of 6th Avenue, said there was nothing tasteless about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't really see anything because (the police) concealed it so well. 
They were very professional about it," Sinclair said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RESIDENT SHOOTS MAN DURING BURGLARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old suspected gang member who broke into an Arleta house was 
critically wounded Wednesday after he was chased and shot by the occupant of 
the residence, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The injured Pacoima man was placed on life-support equipment at Holy Cross 
Medical Center after the 2 a.m. shooting in the 13800 block of Wingo Street, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man's name was not released because his family had not been notified. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when the Pacoima man and a 17-year-old boy, both identified 
by police as members of a Pacoima gang, broke into the Wingo Street residence 
of Isaiah Brewster, 28, and threatened him with a handgun, Detective Al Ferrand 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brewster was an acquaintance of the two intruders but is not believed to be a 
gang member. The motive for the break-in was not known, Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
During the confrontation, a fight began and the two intruders fled. Police said 
Brewster grabbed a shotgun and chased the 23-year-old and shot him in the upper 
body. 
</P>
<P>
Brewster was detained and questioned by police but was later released. "There 
is a self-defense issue and we discussed it with the district attorney's office 
and released him," Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
The juvenile was arrested in the neighborhood on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon and was being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall.

A coalition of Glendale homeowner associations has asked the state to 
investigate whether a countywide force of firefighters responded efficiently to 
a hillside blaze that destroyed 46 homes and damaged 20 others in the city on 
June 27, a spokesman for the coalition said Wednesday. Some activists have 
charged that many homes were lost in neighborhoods neglected by firefighters 
until well after the flames had spread. The Glendale Homeowners Coordinating 
Council, representing 15 homeowner associations, asked that Atty. Gen. John K. 
Van de Kamp, along with the state fire marshal's staff, "conduct a full 
investigation of all aspects of the fire."

PADRES LOSE, PROVE ZIMMER TO BE ALL WET

Padre Manager Greg Riddoch leaned back in his office chair, looked at the 
cluster of reporters in front of him and raised his hands in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone got any suggestions?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, big guy, this baby's all yours. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who only three months ago were virtually everyone's pick to win the 
National League West, if not run away with the division, have become 
everybody's favorite patsy. 
</P>
<P>
It has been ugly enough as it is, and their losing streak has been downright 
nasty, but Wednesday's 4-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs in front of 33,856 at 
Wrigley Field turned into the ultimate embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Cub Manager Don Zimmer was so fed up seeing his pitcher, Greg Maddux, go 
without a victory that he publicly proclaimed before the game that he'd take a 
swim in chilly Lake Michigan if Maddux beat the Padres to end a personal 
13-game drought. 
</P>
<P>
So, anyone have an extra pair of size-44 swim trunks lying around? 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer, 5-feet-10, 205 pounds, appeared after the game wearing blue sunglasses, 
an open life jacket and a buoy strapped around his legs. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think anyone would take me seriously," he said. "I swim like a rock." 
</P>
<P>
But just as Pittsburgh Pirate broadcaster Jim Rooker walked across the state of 
Pennsylvania last year and Chicago White Sox broadcaster Tom Paciorek shaved 
his head on TV after similar statements, don't be surprised if Zimmer is forced 
to swim at least a few strokes toward the other side of the lake 60 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux not only won his first game since May 5, but with the exception of Jack 
Clark's homer, he allowed just three baserunners to even reach third during his 
seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a guy who was 0-8 with a 6.15 ERA in his past 13 starts and had not 
won a game since the last time he faced in the Padres in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"What a better team to do it than against us," said Padre starter Dennis 
Rasmussen (7-7), the latest victim of their offensive ineptitude. "It isn't 
like we're lighting the world on fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, and when we get down, it's like we lay down and die. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't smelled a rally since San Francisco a couple of months ago." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' losing ways have reached such epidemic proportions that they have 
even gotten Riddoch thoroughly depressed after just a week on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm an eternal optimist," Riddoch said. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres (38-49) have lost 18 of their past 22 games and are now firmly 
entrenched in their worst period of this length since Aug. 21-Sept. 16, 1974, 
when they lost 21 of 25. And that was the year they finished at 60-102. 
</P>
<P>
It's little wonder Riddoch already has lost five pounds in a week and was 
asking reporters if he really looked like "death warmed over?" 
</P>
<P>
"This is unbelievable isn't it?" said Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn. "Every 
day, I come in here thinking that today's the day. That today we'll turn it 
around. But we've said that for the last 20 days or so, and what have we won, 
three games?" 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who are left fighting for their dignity instead of anyone in the 
National League West race, have resorted to using the second half of the season 
as a tryout camp, with third base the position with the "Help Wanted" sign. 
</P>
<P>
After going through 11 third basemen since 1987, the Padres are begging for 
someone to step forward and secure the position. 
</P>
<P>
The latest experiment involves Eddie Williams, the 25-year-old San Diego native 
who is with his fifth organization. They want to see if Williams can fill the 
bill, then say goodby to Mike Pagliarulo, who's eligible for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Well, while the Padres might be excited about his offensive potential -- .277 
(five for 18) with two homers and three RBIs his first four games -- his 
defense leaves them wincing. 
</P>
<P>
It was Williams who cost the Padres two runs and perhaps the game Wednesday 
with his bases-loaded error in the fifth. Luis Salazar hit a slow chopper 
toward the bag, and Williams had no trouble fielding the ball, but his throw to 
Clark at first was about seven feet out of his reach, allowing two runs to 
score. 
</P>
<P>
There was another ball that probably should have also been fielded by Williams 
in the second when Lloyd McClendon hit a sharp grounder toward third. But when 
Williams tried to make the play, the ball stayed down and rolled into left 
field, scoring a run. The official scorer originally ruled the play an error, 
but minutes later changed it into hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to bury the kid," Riddoch said. "Let's give him a chance and see 
if he can play up here. We don't have a whole lot of time left to analyze our 
situation, and we want to know by the end of the year whether he can play for 
us or not." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who made 16 errors in 66 games for the White Sox in 1989, 
understandably was a bit defensive when talking about his latest fielding 
mishaps. Then again, he's quite used to being questioned about his glove. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't worry about it, just because of my reputation," Williams said. "Every 
day you step on the field, anybody can make an error. It just so happens that I 
made an error today that probably cost us the game. 
</P>
<P>
"If I made a great play every time, I wouldn't have been in the minor leagues, 
now would I? If I didn't strike out, I probably would have been Mike Schmidt 
overnight." 
</P>
<P>
While Williams is playing, starting successive days against right-handed 
pitching, Pagliarulo has been left sitting on the bench pondering his future. 
Riddoch has told him that he wants to take a good look at Williams, but it 
doesn't help Pagliarulo accept the benching any more easily. 
</P>
<P>
"It's damn tough sitting on the bench," said Pagliarulo, 30. "I'd rather stay 
home. I don't really understand it. I'm not a veteran. They haven't really seen 
me play, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it, but what am I going to do, picket? Hold a sign? I don't have 
an alternative. But if you're a team player, you do what you're told and keep 
your mouth shut, and that's what I'm trying to do right now." 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo has started 54 games, batting .249 with three homers and 15 RBIs and 
committing 10 errors. The Padres say his production is adequate, but they still 
would like to see him with more power. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also are making it known that they believe Joe Carter belongs in 
left field, not center. He likely will remain in left for most of the season, 
Riddoch said, with Shawn Abner and Thomas Howard in center. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's more important right now," Riddoch said, "leaving the 
veterans in there and winning games, or leave the young kids in and see what 
they can do. I think the best thing for the organization is to find out whether 
these kids can play or not, but I hate to sacrifice wins doing it, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite obvious we've got some problems right now, and I have to fight 
through it. I'm the manager, and I feel responsible for it. Maybe I don't 
deserve it, but I'll take the blame for what we're going through. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's why I really don't have an appetite right now." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Mike Dunne, who was in a half-cast Wednesday after breaking his 
right fibula Tuesday, showed reporters X-rays of the fractured bone. It was 
shattered so severely, Dunne said, that doctors must X-ray the leg again next 
week to determine if it must be re-broken and properly set. "But as bad as my 
leg is broken," Dunne said, "my heart is broken worse." Dunne, who missed the 
last month of the 1989 season with arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder, 
said that he now will look into pitching winter ball in the off-season. "I 
haven't talked to anybody about it yet," Dunne said, "but I've got to start 
getting some innings in." . . . The Padres have yet to decide who to bring up 
to replace Dunne but have narrowed their options to between pitcher John Davis 
and utility infielder Joey Cora. . . . Whitey Wietelmann, the former longtime 
Padre coach who still works in the organization, is planning to retire at the 
end of the season.

BOSSES, PLAYERS LIKE THE WAY BOCHY IS TAKING TO MANAGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

RIVERSIDE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bruce Bochy steps into his car and guides it away from his North San Diego 
County home and onto Interstate 15, going north. 
</P>
<P>
About the time city turns to country, he flips on the air-conditioner. He 
drives past the roadside fruit stands and into the desert heat, the kind that 
shimmers up off the road and dances in your face. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-one miles later, he pulls into the Riverside Sports Center parking lot 
and walks into the clubhouse and toward his future. He is the manager of the 
Riverside Red Wave, a Padre Class A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the drive isn't bad. On the way up, he has a chance to think about 
game situations and analyze players. On the way home, he has a chance to 
unwind. 
</P>
<P>
Bochy makes this drive into one of the lowest levels of the minors almost every 
day the Red Wave is home. Sometimes, such as when day games follow night, he 
will get a hotel room and stay in Riverside. When the team is on the road, 
Bochy lives from bus ride to hotel room to ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
He is 35 and played professionally for 14 seasons. He is a former catcher, and 
maybe that's part of the reason why his second career is off to such a good 
start. Anyone in baseball will tell you that catchers see the game differently 
than almost everyone else and, in most cases, that helps them to understand it. 
Everyone and everything is in front of them. They see it all laid out. 
</P>
<P>
As his playing career wound down during his time with the Padres, he began 
planning ahead. He sat in dugouts throughout the National League and silently 
second-guessed his managers. 
</P>
<P>
"What would I do in this situation?" he asked himself. He knew he eventually 
wanted to manage. Bruce Bochy, you see, is a baseball man. 
</P>
<P>
Like the players in Class A ball, Bochy is working for his future. Sure, he 
would like to manage in the majors some day. For now, though, he is content. He 
is still learning, and he is running into situations he never imagined during 
all of those years in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for instance, an incident earlier this season. Riverside was tied in the 
bottom of the 10th, and speedy outfielder Darrell Sherman tripled. Bochy, 
coaching third, was tense, but he noticed Sherman staring up into the stands 
with a puzzled look. 
</P>
<P>
"Sherm, are you all right?" Bochy asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fine." 
</P>
<P>
"What's the matter?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't look good." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to find my dad. He's my ride home." 
</P>
<P>
"You're killing me, Sherm. You're my winning run. I'll give you a ride home." 
</P>
<P>
No, this wasn't what he imagined when he first started managing last season in 
Spokane, Wash., home of a Padres' Rookie League team. Bochy led the team to the 
Northwest League title. The job he did -- and in the minors, that means 
developing players, not just winning -- grabbed the attention of the Padre 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"He is highly respected," said Tom Romenesko, Padre director of player 
development. "He's got a chance to really be an outstanding asset to the 
Padres." 
</P>
<P>
The thing Romenesko likes best about Bochy is his adaptability. Here's a guy 
who climbed all the way up the ladder in professional baseball, including major 
league stops with Houston, the New York Mets and the Padres. He was with the 
Padres the longest, from 1983-1987, and even got an at-bat in the 1984 World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Now, just like the kids he manages, he is starting from the bottom. He is 
molding young prospects and at the same time shaping himself in a new aspect of 
the game. And people are watching. 
</P>
<P>
"He's adjusted from being at the upper level for 14 years and now he's adjusted 
to a different generation of kids," Romenesko said. "Everyone asks the question 
how will a guy deal with the low minor leagues. Bruce Bochy has dealt with it 
and turned it into a very big plus." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bochy: "The guys have been great. This is probably as much fun as you can 
have as a manager. The guys are young, and eager to learn. They know they have 
a lot to learn, and their ears are open when you talk to them. And you probably 
see as much improvement at this level as anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
No question, Bochy is popular with his players. Several of them say how patient 
he is and how much they appreciate the fact that he will not criticize them 
without explaining what they should have done. 
</P>
<P>
Said outfielder Vince Harris: "He's great. He's a good manager to play for. He 
tells you exactly what he expects and what you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
He must be doing something right, because ask Bochy what his most difficult 
adjustment has been from playing to managing, and he says patience. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to remember, the game is not as easy as it looks," Bochy said. "The 
guys are going to make mistakes. I'm going to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
It's an interesting mix. Bochy is trying to build a managing career for 
himself, but he needs the help of young kids in their early 20s, most of whom 
will never see a day of major league baseball in their lives. But if they do 
have a chance, they will have to listen to Bochy. They feed on each other. 
</P>
<P>
Bochy realized immediately last year at Spokane that managing would be quite a 
learning experience. He took losses harder as a manager than he did as a 
player, and he learned that an uptight manager in Class A does not help when he 
is trying to teach a bunch of guys from different schools and different parts 
of the country how to play professional baseball. He learned that for the most 
part, these kids will do anything to get a break. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing you have going for you," he said, "is that these guys have just 
signed a contract, and they're so enthused. They'll go through a wall for you. 
Even in A ball, they'll give you 100% for the most part. In the big leagues, 
it's hard to get that. Here, guys listen and don't give you a hard time." 
</P>
<P>
He has been forced to learn how to lose. The Red Wave started 0-7 this season, 
and that eventually turned into 2-14. During that time, Bochy's players were 
calling him "Sybil," after the woman of multiple personalities. The Red Wave 
improved, though. They finished the first half of the California League season 
at 35-36, and they were 15-12 before Wednesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
Bochy is a laid-back sort. The dry desert air is matched only by Bochy's dry 
sense of humor. Not much ruffles him -- not the 100-degree heat or the broken 
pitching machine or the long bus rides, the longest of which is the eight-hour 
trip to Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, bus rides aren't what they used to be. Riverside charters a bus 
complete with air conditioning, televisions, VCRs and video games. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, when I played in the Southern League, the bus broke down half the time," 
Bochy said. "That part of it never bothered me anyway. The guys I've been with, 
I've had fun with them. Maybe after four or five years, I'll change my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Managing in A ball is not the most glamorous position in baseball. The manager 
throws batting practice, solves problems and fills out daily game reports for 
the organization after each game. Bochy calls a Padre 800 number and tapes a 
short summary that includes the game result, the team's won-lost record, league 
standing and the starting pitcher for next game. Then he comments on pitchers, 
the offense, the defense and generalities. 
</P>
<P>
The unwritten rule is that a manager should keep a distance from his players. 
Getting too close could color his judgement. But Bochy doesn't worry too much 
about that. 
</P>
<P>
"They say you can't get close to them, but I do," Bochy said. "Bus trips, 
you're here every day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them if I can help them, come in at any time. Sure, they're going to 
have personal problems, and I try helping. It's tough. A lot of them are away 
from home for the first time. You feel like a baby-sitter. They get down when 
they go through their first slump. It's all part of my job." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, shortstop Luis Lopez -- one of the best players on the 
Riverside team -- tore up a knee. Bochy stayed overnight and took Lopez to San 
Diego the next day. Romenesko was ready to take Lopez to the doctor, but Bochy 
volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was going to have to undergo reconstructive knee surgery. As Dr. Jan 
Fronek relayed the information, he told Romenesko later, Bochy had tears in his 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Said Romenesko: "That told me a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
The players know Bochy cares, and since most of them are away from home for the 
first time, Bochy's job is surrogate father as well as manager. When a player 
fails to pay a bill or has some other kind of problem, it somehow comes back to 
Bochy. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has bothered him at home yet, but he has had a few calls on the road. 
And he has also had a few phone calls from security when things get too noisy 
on the road. Nothing serious, Bochy said, but boys will be boys. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres as an organization, do not allow their minor leaguers to have beer 
or women -- wives and girlfriends excepted -- in hotel rooms on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Once, last year, Bochy heard some noise, walked into a hotel room and found 
three of his players and some girls. One of the players was hiding between the 
mattress and the box springs of the bed. It didn't take long to find him. But . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"I was airing him out," Bochy said. "We were up three stories, and one guy was 
outside hanging from the balcony by his fingertips." 
</P>
<P>
Bochy did not find him. 
</P>
<P>
Bochy can tell the story now only because he was fined in the players' Kangaroo 
Court for not catching the fourth guy.

NFL ROUNDUP;

<P>
CHARGERS, ARCHER AGREE TO TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chargers have agreed to contract terms with backup quarterback David Archer 
and two more draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
The draft choices are tight end Derrick Walker, a seventh-round selection from 
Michigan, and H-back Tommie Stowers, an 11th-rounder from Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Archer has agreed to a two-year contract that will pay him approximately 
$300,000 per year, his agent, Steve Feldman of Newport Beach, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Archer, 28, came to the Chargers last season as a free agent after he was 
released by Washington. He completed five of 12 passes for 62 yards with one 
interception and also was the holder on placements. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, 6-feet-0 1/2 and 244 pounds, was the last of four Charger draft choices 
in the sixth round and the 163rd player taken overall. He caught 12 passes for 
110 yards and three touchdowns as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Walker's agent, Thom Darden of Cleveland, declined to provide terms of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Stowers, 6-3 and 225, played fullback for Missouri, where last season he led 
the team in rushing for the second consecutive year with 547 yards and six 
touchdowns. He was second on the team in receptions with 28 for 268 yards. He 
was the 283rd player selected overall. 
</P>
<P>
No terms of Stowers' contract were released by the Chargers in announcing his 
signing. 
</P>
<P>
The agreements leave the Chargers with nine veterans and seven draft choices 
who have not come to contract agreements. The Chargers open training camp at UC 
San Diego Friday with rookies and selected veterans reporting. CURT HOLBREICH

For those who think the secret to winning baseball games is to get a few timely 
hits, score a couple of runs, receive good pitching and toss the leather 
around, Sun Valley Coach Les Riley has a few amendments for your checklist. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Valley did little of the above yet managed a 7-6 win over Newhall-Saugus in 
a first-round game of the American Legion District 20 playoffs at Birmingham 
High on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, Riley admitted that Sun Valley did none of the above. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an ugly one," Riley said as a smile crossed his face. "This was one of 
those games where whoever makes the most mistakes loses it. You just keep 
playing and hope for the best." 
</P>
<P>
The best of the worst: 
</P>
<P>
* Sun Valley scored seven runs on seven hits, but only three players were 
credited with driving in runs, the remainder scoring on a variety of blunders. 
The three runs were driven in on sacrifice flies. 
</P>
<P>
* Either the lead changed hands or the score was tied five times in the teams' 
final eight at-bats in a game that lasted 3 hours 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
* Newhall-Saugus, which outhit Sun Valley, 12-7, stranded two runners in the 
first, second, third, fourth and eighth innings and three in the fifth for a 
total of 13. 
</P>
<P>
* Starters Raul Torres of Sun Valley and Doug Maggiora of Newhall-Saugus 
allowed a combined 12 runs in 13 innings, nine of which were earned. Yet 
neither figured in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
* Newhall-Saugus catcher John Lopata, who allowed five passed balls, was so 
trouble-plagued that he was yanked from behind the plate in the middle of the 
seventh inning after allowing back-to-back passed balls. Sun Valley also stole 
five bases. 
</P>
<P>
* Sun Valley scored a run in the seventh and the eventual game-winner in the 
eighth without benefit of a hit. 
</P>
<P>
* Newhall-Saugus made five errors, Sun Valley three. 
</P>
<P>
Despite itself, Sun Valley (20-4) advanced to a second-round game against 
Woodland Hills East at 1 p.m. today at Birmingham. Newhall-Saugus (15-10) lost 
a second game Wednesday to Glendale, 9-3, and was eliminated from the 
double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 6-6, in the eighth, Torres reached base on shortstop Jayme 
Riggio's fielding error. Torres stole second, and with one out, moved to third 
on Wil Molina's sacrifice bunt. But he didn't stay at third for long. 
</P>
<P>
Molina's sacrifice was fielded by pitcher Oscar Silva, who threw the ball away 
at third trying to nail Torres. Third baseman Ben Ealy missed what appeared to 
be a catchable ball and drew an error as Torres skipped home for a 7-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good play if they get him at third," Riley said. "And it's the 
ballgame if they don't." 
</P>
<P>
Newhall-Saugus' David Bildner drew a walk to lead off the ninth, but Coach Tom 
Pedersen elected to forsake the sacrifice bunt. Chris Stark -- who had three 
hits and two RBIs as he stepped to the plate -- grounded into a 6-4-3 double 
play. Ealy struck out to end it. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Jake Loveridge, who relieved Torres in the seventh, pitched the 
final 2 2/3 innings and allowed no runs to earn the victory. Loveridge (6-1) 
struck out one, walked two and allowed one hit. 
</P>
<P>
Stark's run-scoring single drove in Josh Nolan to tie the score, 5-5, and chase 
Torres in favor of Loveridge. Nolan took off for second, but Sun Valley catcher 
Steve Chavez's throw went into center and allowed Lopata to score from third 
for a 6-5 Newhall-Saugus lead.

ARMY STINT PUT PRICE ON COURSE TO SUCCESS

<P>
Lisa Price of Ventura took a pretty typical route into professional golf. 
</P>
<P>
You know the one. Don't play any golf at all as a kid or even as a high school 
student, join the military and play the slide trombone in the U. S. Army band, 
get coerced into playing a round of golf -- finally, at the age of 19 -- with 
your sergeant, leave the Army and become a walk-on member of a college golf 
team, turn pro, qualify for the LPGA Championship, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Geez. How many times have we heard that story? 
</P>
<P>
Price, 31, who works as a teaching pro at the Ojai Valley Inn and Country Club, 
overcame her relative lack of a golfing background to win the LPGA's Western 
Section Teaching Championship in Phoenix in May, thus earning an exemption into 
the LPGA Championship, one of the most prestigious women's golfing events. The 
tournament runs from July 26-29 at the Bethesda (Md.) Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
Price is quick to admit that she really had no intention of bringing her game 
to this level. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no desire to try the LPGA Tour," she said. "I thought about all the 
traveling and all the work it would take and just decided it wasn't for me. 
Unless you're a superstar right away, it's pretty tough to make a living on the 
tour." 
</P>
<P>
After learning golf on the courses of Fort Ord on the Monterey Peninsula, Price 
brought her game -- and the money she earned for college under the GI Bill -- 
to Cal State Fullerton, where she walked into the golf team's first meeting of 
the season and was immediately told she had made the squad. 
</P>
<P>
"They needed a fifth player to make a trip into Mexico for a tournament," she 
said. "I happened to walk in at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
She played golf for four years at Fullerton and became good enough to entertain 
the thought of turning pro. She did in 1983, but quickly became the kind of pro 
who gives a few lessons and sells a few golf sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
She was content with that. And then the qualifying tournament for the Western 
Section Teaching Championship came along. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no expectations of winning the qualifying event," said Price, whose 
husband, Ken, also is a teaching pro at Ojai Valley. "I had played in it four 
or five times and finished in the top 10, but never really came close to 
winning it. I figured this year I'd just play it again and maybe I'd finish 
fourth or fifth. I would have been happy just finishing in the top 10 again. 
</P>
<P>
"My expectations were definitely lower than they had been the other times I 
played in it. After having a baby 18 months ago, my attitude about golf and 
life has changed a lot. A bad shot on a golf course is no big deal now. There 
are things much more important. 
</P>
<P>
"But I went in with that easygoing attitude and found myself shooting well and 
winning it." 
</P>
<P>
Price does not, however, have dreams about winning the LPGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll try to go into that with the same easy attitude," she said. "But the 
stakes are so much higher. I'm sure my knees will be knocking on the first tee. 
I just hope not to let the tournament overwhelm me. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically, I'd like to make the cut. I know I'll have to shoot very well 
-- not out of my head, but just very well -- just to make the cut against those 
women. I've thought a few times about what will happen if I get beyond that, if 
I get anywhere near the leaders, but realistically, the chances of me playing 
four straight days of exceptional golf . . . well, it probably won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
But just qualifying to play in the LPGA Championship is a huge accomplishment. 
Especially for a slide trombone player. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Amateur: Ten Valley-area players qualified Monday for the 
91st Southern California Golf Assn. Amateur Championship, joining eight others 
who received exemptions into the event this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The SCGA Amateur is the oldest continuously contested amateur golf tournament 
in the country. The field of 86 players will play 36 holes Friday at Wilshire 
Country Club, with the top 32 players advancing to the final two rounds 
Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying for the event were John Denny of Glendale, Don Baker of Canoga Park, 
Steve Brubman of North Hollywood, Mike Haney of Glendale, Chris Etue of Canoga 
Park, Dennis Ryan of Glendale, Jim Breen of West Hills, Jimmy Chang of Westlake 
Village, Ed Watts of Camarillo, and Andy Bishop of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Players receiving exemptions from qualifying included Charlie Wi, 18, of 
Thousand Oaks, the surprise winner of the 1990 California Amateur at Pebble 
Beach; veteran Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys; Oxnard's Paul Stankowski, a golfer 
at Texas El Paso; Mitch Voges of Simi Valley; Lee Davis of Thousand Oaks; 
George Gottschalk of Lancaster; Chris Zambri of Thousand Oaks; and David Olsen 
of Sherman Oaks.

Twenty-three Valley-area girls' teams will descend on three Southern California 
sites this weekend to compete in the Amateur Softball Assn. Major Travel State 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 teams will take part in the tournament, which begins Friday and 
ends Sunday. The 14-and-under championships will be held in Riverside, the 
16-and-under tournament will take place in Escondido, and the 18-and-under 
championships will be in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The champions of the three divisions advance to the national championships, 
Aug. 8-12. The 14-and-under tournament will be in Fort Worth, Tex.; the 
16-and-under national championships will take place in Garland, Tex.; and the 
18-and-under tournament will be contested in Lodi, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"Most teams play six to eight tournaments in preparation for this," said Dick 
Siegel, coach of the West Valley Hot Shots, who are entered in the 16-and-under 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"You must attend (a minimum of) two tournaments to attend the state 
championships, which explains the great number of teams that are going." 
</P>
<P>
The Hot Shots include players from Agoura, Calabasas, El Camino Real, Canoga 
Park, Taft, Reseda, Thousand Oaks, and Paraclete highs. Most members started on 
their high school teams this year as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Major Travel is one of the divisions of the Junior Olympic program, which 
features 700,000 youths throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very competitive atmosphere," Siegel said. "We face people like Kym 
Weil (Southern Section 4-A Division Player of the Year from Hart) all the time. 
Every team has huge tryouts every year." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "Anyone who is anyone in softball these days has gone through 
tournaments like the one (this weekend)." 
</P>
<P>
Four of Siegel's players -- Heidi Crocker of El Camino Real, Keri Borzello of 
Taft, Heather Siegel of Calabasas, and Jacquelyn Stafford of Canoga Park -- 
will travel to Detroit for the Youth Maccabiah Games, which begin Aug. 18.

CERULLO CLOSE TO BUYING OUT BAKKERS' S.C. THEME PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local evangelist Morris Cerullo may be just a few days away from closing a 
$45-million deal to purchase the Heritage USA theme park in South Carolina. If 
the sale goes through, Cerullo may move his San Diego-based ministry to the 
park, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Thurmond Bishop of Columbia, S.C., approved the 
previously announced deal Wednesday but the transaction is conditional upon the 
consent of two PTL creditors who are out of the country. The creditors' 
lawyers, however, have said their clients will approve the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo, who heads World Evangelism of San Diego, agreed in May to a two-part 
deal to acquire the scandal-plagued religious empire formerly run by defrocked 
evangelist Jim Bakker. Cerullo is in escrow to complete the first phase, the 
purchase of the PTL cable TV network for $7 million. Last month, Cerullo paid a 
$1-million deposit to acquire the real estate and theme park segment of PTL. 
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously happy with Judge Thurmond Bishop's decision to conditionally 
approve our offer," Cerullo said in a prepared statement. "We are extremely 
hopeful that, by next Tuesday, all the creditors will issue their approval and 
we can go forward with the New Heritage USA. . . . As soon as final approvals 
are achieved, we will be assembling a team of top-notch professionals to 
oversee and operate the facility." 
</P>
<P>
About 100 PTL creditors have already approved the agreement. Cerullo will 
withdraw from the bidding for the park if the two remaining creditors balk at 
the agreement, Cerullo spokesman Alan Elias said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis W. Shedd, who was appointed trustee by the bankruptcy court to manage 
the liquidation of the PTL estate, has said he will sell off the park piecemeal 
if he cannot find a buyer for the entire property. He did not return calls to 
his Columbia office Wednesday. Cerullo will not comment on his plans for 
Heritage park until the sale is final, but he does intend to renovate the 
facility, according to his statement released Wednesday. Dormant since 
September, the park would not be ready to operate again until sometime next 
year, Elias said. 
</P>
<P>
"He intends to run it as a for-profit business, with all the money going back 
into the ministry, just like a business," Elias said. "They have $52 million in 
bills to pay." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Of the Heritage USA park's 2,200 acres, only about 500 are developed. The park 
now includes a 500-room hotel, another hotel of the same size under 
construction, a water slide, a shopping mall and miniature railroad. Ownership 
of the land is disputed by an Indian tribe that has claimed in a lawsuit that 
it was illegally taken from them by the U.S. government in the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Elias declined to reveal details of the financing of the deal, except to say 
that it "has been secured through a line of credit by established 
institutions." 
</P>
<P>
Morris Cerullo World Evangelism ministry acquired the cable TV network by 
outbidding evangelist Oral Roberts, who offered $6.3 million. That part of the 
deal is scheduled to close Aug. 29, pending Federal Communications Commission 
approval, Elisa said. 
</P>
<P>
PTL broadcasting headquarters are inside Heritage USA in Fort Mill, S.C., and 
Cerullo will move his TV studio and possibly his ministry's headquarters from 
San Diego to the PTL facility if he purchases the park, Elias said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's being considered by the board of directors," Elias said. Cerullo's 
headquarters office in San Diego nowemploys about 40 people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo, a 58-year-old faith healer, has in the past declined to discuss his 
ministry's finances. Founded in 1961, Worldwide Evangelism produces a daily TV 
program called "Victory With Morris Cerullo" that is carried by 40 stations 
nationwide. The show is also broadcast in Canada, and the ministry has 
operations in Great Britain, the Philippines and Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
The evangelist has been known for ambitious but failed attempts to expand the 
reach of his ministry in San Diego. He bought the downtown El Cortez Hotel and 
tried to convert it into an evangelism school before selling it in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
He also proposed a 200-acre retirement center and religious education center on 
land the church owned in the Mira Mesa area, but he ended up selling the 
property to a home builder. 
</P>
<P>
PTL has been under the control of a U.S. Bankruptcy court since June, 1987, two 
months after Jim Bakker resigned the ministry following a sex-and-hush-money 
scandal involving former church secretary Jessica Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker is serving a 45-year federal prison term in Minnesota on fraud and 
conspiracy convictions last October for allegedly deceiving Heritage USA 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo was once a friend of Jim Bakker and his wife, Tammy, and occasionally 
appeared on the Bakkers' TV program.

DISPOSABLE-DIAPER GUILT FEELING RECYCLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Environmentally conscious parents who reluctantly use non-biodegradable 
disposable diapers can now take advantage of a service that will pick up soiled 
paper and plastic diapers and recycle their components. 
</P>
<P>
Babyland Diaper Service of San Diego has started California's first disposable 
diaper recycling program, born out of growing concerns that the convenient 
diapers are adding to the crisis of overflowing landfills. 
</P>
<P>
The service is the result of an unlikely marriage between Babyland, a cloth 
diaper supplier, and one of its competitors, Weyerhaeuser Co., the nation's 
third largest disposable diaper manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pioneers in what I believe is an environmental revolution," said James 
Houlihan, president of Babyland. "The desire to provide concrete solutions, not 
talk, has brought us together." 
</P>
<P>
Babyland has 300 clients using the recycling alternative compared to 3,000 
using its cloth diaper service. 
</P>
<P>
Under the service, which started in February, Babyland vans deliver and 
retrieve Weyerhaeuser's Loving Touch disposable diapers weekly in the San Diego 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The soiled diapers are processed at the Babyland plant, where patented 
equipment cleans, shreds and separates the diapers into their two major 
components. 
</P>
<P>
The fluffy absorbent pulp interiors are sent to San Diego-based Fiber Resources 
Unlimited, where they are compressed, baled and sold to companies manufacturing 
grocery bags, cardboard boxes, stationary and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
The plastic exteriors are condensed and mixed with other plastics at Western 
Gold Thermoplastics in Los Angeles. The plastics are typically used to 
manufacture cassette tapes and nursery flats for carrying plants. 
</P>
<P>
More than 80,000 San Diego babies contribute 4 million disposables a year to 
landfills. Experts say disposable diapers will remain in landfills for at least 
500 years. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have warned that several of the county's six landfills are 
rapidly approaching capacity, and state Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) has led 
a drive to ban the use of disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the new service, which varies according to volume, is slightly more 
expensive than traditional cloth diaper delivery or supermarket disposable 
diaper brands. 
</P>
<P>
"On average, your general price may run about $2 more to use this service. But, 
when you factor in the amount Californians are using to pay for solid-waste 
disposal, it evens out," said Babyland vice president Diane Kudo. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are fascinated the first time they hear they can use a disposable 
diaper that doesn't have to be used just one time. Parents want to do the right 
thing," she said.

NIXON LIBRARY HITS CLOSE TO HOME; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: SIMPLE RED-TILED PAVILIONS AND A REFLECTING POOL ARE AS 
UNPRETENTIOUS AS THE CLAPBOARD FARMHOUSE WHERE THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS BORN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A simple yet moving image shapes the design of the new Richard M. Nixon Library 
and Birthplace -- the image of the great leap the former President made from a 
small white clapboard farmhouse to the pinnacle of power in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Perched on a knoll shaded by pepper trees, the 1913 Nixon house -- reputedly 
ordered from a Sears catalogue -- is an architectural counterpoint to the smart 
new library down the hill. The axis of the long reflecting pool that lies at 
the center of the new library points straight to the President's boyhood home 
and the bed in which he was born. 
</P>
<P>
"Nixon's journey from humble obscurity to national leadership is a central 
symbol in the way the library was laid out on the site," said library architect 
Richard Poulos. "The little house on the hill is the emotional anchor of the 
design." 
</P>
<P>
The Nixon library is in many ways an extension of the President's home. Its 
character is muted, carefully crafted and very much in tune with the shady 
suburban streets that surround it. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Langdon Wilson Architecture &amp; Planning, a national firm 
headquartered in Newport Beach, the library is a fine and appropriate building 
with no pretensions of being a great act of architecture. Its style expresses 
the down-home, ordinary-guy side of Nixon's character rather than the 
ambiguities of his complex soul. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon made two major demands upon the architectural character of the library, 
Poulos said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted a traditional, not a modernist building, and he insisted that the 
library create a welcoming atmosphere that would encourage people to visit and 
often return." 
</P>
<P>
Composed of three low, red-tiled pavilions grouped around the reflecting pool, 
the complex breathes an air of domestic tranquility. 
</P>
<P>
Clad in warm red Arizona sandstone set between a plinth of buff-colored cement 
plaster and a recessed band of black slate under the roof line, the library's 
architecture is truly welcoming and unmonumental. Its character continues the 
unpretentious tradition of most of the eight other presidential libraries. 
</P>
<P>
The $14-million Nixon library is closer in spirit to such humble structures as 
the 1916 Rutherford B. Hayes Library in Fremont, Ohio -- the first presidential 
archive -- or Harry S. Truman's library in Independence, Mo., rather than the 
inspirational monumentality of the John F. Kennedy library in Dorchester, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy library, designed by noted architect I.M. Pei, is a stark white 
concrete mausoleum set off by a 112-foot-high atrium enclosed in black glass 
overlooking Boston Harbor. Fit for a Pharaoh, the Kennedy library "makes it 
hard to believe that Mr. Kennedy was anything but a man of energy, of zest, of 
confidence," one architectural critic commented. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Nixon library makes no attempt to overwhelm the public with 
its importance. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first features a visitor sees on arriving at the library is a grove 
of orange trees flanking the entrance. The grove not only softens the hard 
surfaces of the architecture, but also recalls the site's original purpose as 
the citrus farm of Frank Nixon, the former President's father. 
</P>
<P>
The parking lot surrounding the library is landscaped with terraces, patterned 
paving and a lush fountain. Gentle steps lead up to the main entrance on the 
southeast corner of the site, through an entry portico and into the generous 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
For security reasons, the visitor's progress through the library is firmly but 
discreetly directed throughout the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"To accommodate visitors while protecting the safety of the archival materials, 
we must control the way people move through the building," said attorney Hugh 
Hewitt, the library's acting executive director. "We want to operate this 
control discreetly but firmly." 
</P>
<P>
In the lobby, a granite-topped reception desk directs the circulation. Under 
the lobby pavilion's high, peaked ceiling -- the shape mimicking the 
configuration of a Quaker meeting hall of the kind the Nixon family frequented 
-- is an array of panels displaying the library layout. 
</P>
<P>
An east wall of glass frames a charming vista along the length of the 
reflecting pool to the grassy knoll on which the Nixon house sits. 
</P>
<P>
The Roman-style formality of the pool and its bordering trellis and colonnade 
make a touching contrast with the humble silhouette of the original farmhouse 
seen in the middle distance. 
</P>
<P>
The opposite lobby wall is lined with a curving panel of bird's-eye maple that 
hides the restrooms and small gift shop tucked into a corner. Alabaster 
chandeliers and indirect cove lighting soften the hard surfaces of the terrazzo 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
The lobby will also host temporary exhibits, such as a collection of Winston 
Churchill's paintings or jazz genius Duke Ellington's memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
The average visitor, who, it is estimated, will spend about two hours going 
through the library, next proceeds to the 300-seat theater flanking the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
In this pleasant paneled space, carpeted in Nixon's favorite dark blue, the 
audience can see a 25-minute orientation film covering the President's life. 
</P>
<P>
The theater is also intended for lectures and debates. "We may even restage the 
famous argument between William Buckley and Gore Vidal -- a Nixon-lover and a 
Nixon-hater," Hewitt said. "The President himself suggested it." 
</P>
<P>
Between the theater and the exhibit hall is a gallery displaying the 67 Time 
magazine covers that featured Nixon through his long political career. These 
drawings, caricatures and photos are a vivid shorthand record of a remarkable 
man's odyssey through one of the nation's most troubled periods. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit hall is the most demanding sequence in the visitor's journey 
through the library. 
</P>
<P>
Alternating "hard" rooms charged with information and "soft" rooms with 
evocative scenarios, the exhibit hall is a concentrated and detailed record of 
Nixon's public life, designed by Demartin Marona Cranstoun Downes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Road to the Presidency" begins the journey with an evocation of the 
post-World War II era. A 1949 Ford Mercury station wagon with butter-yellow 
panels has a cardboard cutout of Nixon perched on the tailgate while delivering 
a political speech. 
</P>
<P>
This scenario leads into a curving wall of text and photos covering Nixon's 
vice presidency, which in turn opens into a cubicle dominated by a giant TV 
replaying the famous Nixon-Kennedy debates of the 1960 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In each space the ceiling is raised or lowered, to heighten or reduce the 
feeling of intimacy. Because most Americans saw the innovative 1960 TV debates 
in their living rooms, the ceiling here is low and domestic. Where the scenes 
are more public, the ceilings are higher. 
</P>
<P>
The highest ceiling, lit by a series of skylights, is in the World Leaders 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Here plaster casts of 10 world leaders, selected by Nixon for their influence 
on his career and his thinking, line the walls. Ranging from a lofty Charles de 
Gaulle to a dumpy Golda Meir, the figures offer a homey gallery of the 
personalities populating the President's past. 
</P>
<P>
An interactive, touch-screen video display allows one to learn about the 
leaders before plunging into the darkened chamber titled Foreign Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Blinking in the transition from bright natural sunshine, the visitor discerns 
the outlines of glittering, gilded re-creations of Beijing's China Gate and 
Moscow's St. Basil's Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked away among the glories is a mock-up of the living room of a typical 
Middle-American suburban tract home in which many people might have watched 
Nixon's encounters with the likes of Mao Tse-tung and Nikita S. Khrushchev. 
</P>
<P>
The next space offers a relief from the weight of world history. 
</P>
<P>
Titled the Pat Nixon Area, this long gallery is lit by a bank of windows that 
offer yet another vista of the Nixon house beyond a terraced rose garden. 
Display cases hold photos of scenes from the Nixons' life in the White House, 
and a side chamber re-creates the Lincoln sitting room that was the former 
First Family's favorite White House hideaway. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the gallery a room devoted to domestic affairs leads through the 1972 
presidential campaign into the Watergate era. 
</P>
<P>
The long and constricted Watergate room is "deliberately painful," Hewitt said. 
Headline texts above eye level top photos mounted on back-lit glass panels, 
culminating in the agonizing moment when Nixon waved goodby to the presidency 
in the doorway of a helicopter parked on the White House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Not wanting to end on that note, the designers added a final room with videos 
of 500 taped questions about Nixon's presidency. Electronic screens allow 
participants to call up a question and have Nixon appear on a screen to answer 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Coming out of the intensive experience of the exhibit hall, the visitor finds 
relief in the landscaping. Designed by Emmet Wemple &amp; Associates, the 
formal gardens will in time grow out into a lush setting framing the library's 
pavilions. 
</P>
<P>
A restricted basement area contains the staff offices and the scholars' reading 
room. 
</P>
<P>
In this subterranean space designer Gere Kavanaugh has created a serene 
atmosphere conducive to study. Glass walls allow the staff to keep an eye on 
the valuable documents and objects in the adjoining storerooms. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's choice of Langdon Wilson to design his library was a shrewd one. Among 
the largest architectural practices in the United States, Langdon Wilson has 
created such diverse local landmarks as the Roman villa-style J. Paul Getty 
Museum in Malibu, the glass-walled CNA building near MacArthur Park and the 
Jamboree Center in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
According to Poulos, who heads the firm's Newport Beach office, Nixon is "very 
enthusiastic" about the look of the library. "He says it expresses exactly what 
he wanted to say to posterity, about his accessibility and simplicity of 
style," Poulos said. 
</P>
<P>
The architecture skillfully and subtly embodies this intention. Its symbolism 
is discreet, its manner unassertive, its style perfectly matched to its 
suburban surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
The Nixon library is a thoroughly likable, perfectly realized -- though 
possibly oversimplified -- monument to a very complicated public man.

A LEGAL DIVIDE;

WHEN A PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION, LIKE THE BAR ASSOCIATION, TAKES STAND ON AN

Rosa M. C. Cumare faces a dilemma. She belongs to two groups that endorse the 
equivalent of murder. At least that's how she sees things, now that the Los 
Angeles County Bar Assn. and the American Bar Assn. are on record with a 
resolution supporting a woman's right to make her own decisions concerning 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, it's as if you had an organization that supported apartheid or 
legalizing the killing of minorities," said Cumare, a Catholic and a lawyer 
with the Los Angeles firm of Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson. "If they had a 
resolution that was anti-Semitic, they wouldn't suggest that Jewish members 
remain within the organization. This resolution almost strikes me as being 
anti-Catholic and anti-Mormon. There are a lot of Catholics and Mormons who 
can't support it, and can't be members of the bar if it does." 
</P>
<P>
The county bar is more than just a professional group to Cumare. Having begun 
to practice law only five years ago, after 10 years as an English teacher, she 
turned to the local bar for business contacts, professional advice, inspiration 
and camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the organization to which you really should belong if you are going to 
be a successful lawyer," she said. "It's important to me." 
</P>
<P>
But unless something changes soon, she said, she will feel compelled to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers are, by reputation, a cerebral breed. Educated in the fine art of the 
disputatious flip-flop, they are able, supposedly, to argue either side of an 
issue with dispassionate aplomb and reach agreements based on pragmatism. 
</P>
<P>
But in the legal world or the real world, the issue of abortion tends to render 
conventions moot. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict began Jan. 24, when the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. Board of 
Trustees voted 14-4 to support a proposed American Bar Assn. resolution 
endorsing what some members interpret as a womans' constitutional right to make 
their own choices on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the ABA approved the resolution at its midyear meeting in Los 
Angeles, and the issue that has embroiled the country in emotional civil war 
began rocking the legal community as well. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of those votes, 35 members of the 25,000-member local bar resigned, 
joining 1,100 lawyers who quit the 360,000-member ABA. 
</P>
<P>
Now the countdown has begun for others, who say that unless a drive to push the 
bar back to a position of "neutrality" on the abortion issue succeeds at the 
ABA's annual meeting in Chicago on Aug. 6, they, too, will walk away from the 
nation's leading lawyers' association. There is talk of forming an alternative 
group more compatible with their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
For many bar members who support the "reproductive rights" resolution, the 
anti-abortion position pushes the debate to an impasse. What do religious 
beliefs have to do with the law, they wonder? 
</P>
<P>
"This is a legal issue and we're taking a legal position," said Carolyn J. 
Kozuch, chairwoman of the Women Lawyers Assn. of Los Angeles' Pro Choice 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
If it were only a legal issue, though, there might be more room to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
But Kozuch and others say that they also have a personal stake in the 
resolution. "I don't want other people to make decisions about what happens 
inside of my body. To me, this is a privacy issue, and the way I see it the 
Constitution protects that privacy." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution states: "Be it resolved that the American Bar Assn. recognizes 
the fundamental rights of privacy and equality guaranteed by the United States 
Constitution, and opposes legislation or other governmental action that 
interferes with the confidential relationship between a pregnant woman and her 
physician, or with the decision to terminate the pregnancy at any time before 
the fetus is capable of independent life, as determined by her physician, or 
thereafter when termination of the pregnancy is necessary to protect the 
woman's life or health." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the rest of the country is capable of fighting endlessly on its own 
over abortion. So why should anyone other than bar members and story editors at 
"L.A. Law," care about this internecine legal squabbling? 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Iredale, a tax lawyer in Los Angeles, explained: "The ABA traditionally 
has enormous clout within the profession and therefore within state 
legislatures and with the Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
Iredale and other abortion opponents have no doubt that the bar will assert 
itself in the national debate unless prevented from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
For Iredale, it is simply unthinkable to pay dues to a group that supports 
abortion. She turned in her resignation to the county bar this week, and says 
she will resign from the national bar if it does not reverse its course. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an expensive voluntary organization, and I am not going to have my 
dues used to subsidize the abortion-rights side of this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike belonging to the California State Bar, belonging to the local bar and 
the national bar is voluntary, with dues for the ABA costing a maximum of $250 
a year. But some lawyers argue that the benefits of belonging, such as access 
to group insurance, make membership in the group almost crucial. 
</P>
<P>
Other professional organizations have taken stands on controversial issues, 
including abortion. The California Medical Assn., for instance, has had a 
policy at least since 1983 stating that abortion is a private medical matter 
between a woman and her physician. In the last few years, "two or three" 
physicians have resigned over the issue, a spokesman said. "There is not a 
giant groundswell of disagreement." 
</P>
<P>
There is no simple checklist for how professionals should act when their 
consciences clash with the espoused values of their profession, explained Edwin 
M. Epstein, a nonpracticing lawyer who teaches courses on business ethics and 
corporate social policy at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no sort of machine tool template you can put over a situation and 
have it answered easily," Epstein said. Some ethicists might advise a Kantian 
evaluation of a dilemma, which would demand that people sever ties with an 
organization whose values conflict with theirs. Others would suggest a more 
pragmatic approach, which weighs the relative values and benefits of the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
But with abortion, neither side of the debate seems remotely able to understand 
the other's perspective, so ethicists probably don't offer much help anyway, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Within the bar, many supporters of the abortion resolution have urged their 
anti-abortion colleagues to do the lawyerly thing, and fight for change from 
within the organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Many opponents of the resolution have done just that. 
</P>
<P>
In April, for instance, they forced a rare, full membership vote of the Los 
Angeles County Bar on the issue. They lost. Opponents also ran an alternative 
slate of candidates. They lost. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the abortion resolution now urge their colleagues to be good 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not that easy, opponents say. 
</P>
<P>
At least a few accuse their fellow bar members of insensitivity, at best, and 
persecution, at worst, for failing to see that abortion is, for some, a matter 
of uncompromising religious and moral conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Richard M. Coleman, joined the county bar in the 1960s. He served a term as 
president. But the abortion issue prompted him to resign from that group and 
the ABA. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone said to me 'You're taking your bat and ball and going home' " he said. 
But, "when it's a matter of taking a human life, I have an obligation to take 
the bat away. Some of us believe that abortion is the killing of innocent human 
life. How can anyone expect us to lend our name and money to the taking of a 
life?" 
</P>
<P>
Coleman is incensed that the abortion debate within the bar has not addressed 
what are central issues to those who oppose abortion, such as "Why is a 
24-week-old fetus legally protected, except in the case of abortion?" and "Why 
should an entity with separate brain waves and blood circulation be considered 
a part of the mother?" 
</P>
<P>
He and others are outraged by what they contend is an effort by abortion-rights 
groups to use bar associations to do their bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Estelle Rogers, chairwoman of the Rights of Women Committee of the ABA's 
section of Individual Rights and Responsibilities, said she understands the 
deep convictions of those who oppose the "reproductive rights" resolution -- 
which she helped draft. "I regret deeply that it causes them such pain." 
</P>
<P>
But she denied that the resolution was shaped by outside groups and joins 
others in arguing that there is no such thing as "neutrality" on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
The bar's current position allows members to make a decision on abortion "in 
their own conscience and within their own religious beliefs. Whereas the 
position they would like us to adopt, on the contrary, imposes a set of 
religious beliefs on all segments of society . . . 
</P>
<P>
"What we would all like is for there to be government neutrality on this 
issue," she said. "Since there isn't, the nation's lawyers are obligated to 
take the position that there are some private matters in American life which 
are sacrosanct and must be protected from the whims of the politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Alumbaugh, a business litigation lawyer and author of an essay on the 
resolution in the current issue of Los Angeles Lawyer -- a rebuttal, of sorts 
to an essay by Cumare -- agreed that neutrality is impossible in the abortion 
debate. For the bar to refuse to take a stand would be a tacit endorsement of a 
legal system that has been and largely remains unfairly dominated by the 
perspective of white males, he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Men, Alumbaugh argued, have created a status quo that ignores womens' 
perspectives of the world. The abortion debate is a case in point: "That the 
law posits the fetus and individual as separate entities with conflicting 
rights -- that's a nonwomen's point of view, a fiction." 
</P>
<P>
The "reproductive freedom" resolution that he supports, is part of an necessary 
inching towards a legal system that embraces women and other under-represented 
groups, Alumbaugh said. There are lawyers, however, who believe that women 
should have the right to make their own decisions on abortion, yet think the 
bar should remain neutral in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's both sad and amusing that people are wasting all this time over (a 
debate) that never should have occurred," said William Kurlander, a partner in 
the firm of Barger and Wolen. Although Kurlander describes himself as "pro 
choice," he ran for the county bar's board of trustees on the losing 
alternative slate, which was designed to force the bar "out of politics." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's clear that I'm speaking for the majority of bar members when I 
say I'm 'pro-choice,' " he said. "But I think the bar has enough to do without 
worrying about issues which are about as unrelated to the practice of law as 
you can get." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kurlander and others dispute the basic premise of the contested 
resolution. In its Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services decision, the 
Supreme Court effectively rejected the notion that there is a constitutional 
right to abortion, Kurlander contended. "There is no present right under the 
federal Constitution to have an abortion. If I were rewriting the Constitution, 
I might put one in there, but as the law stands, it's up to individual states." 
</P>
<P>
That analysis is not shared by everyone, Kurlander conceded. But, he added, 
"from a practical standpoint, I think it's wise for the bar association to stay 
away from issues such as abortion. Also, there are such a large number of 
members who have deep moral convictions, I think its unfair for the majority to 
speak for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ongoing battle is, he said, "a perfect example of needless 
dissipation of energies and resources. Hell, I dissipated my resources for two 
months . . . A year from now it won't matter anyhow." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, though, forces on either side of the issue are mustering support, 
lobbying, writing letters and filing charges about where opponents get their 
money and motivation. 
</P>
<P>
The neutrality forces argue that abortion rights groups are pushing the 
resolution; those who hope to defeat the resolution say anti-abortion groups 
are eager for the bar to endorse their viewpoint, but since that's impossible, 
they've decided to push for neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
And for its part, the bar plans to remain neutral in the upcoming debate over 
neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no partiality of any sort being shown by officers, 
directors or staff in this organization," said Richard Collins, director of 
policy and presidential communications of the ABA. "There will be a level 
playing field." 
</P>
<P>
Collins expects the debate to dominate the ABA's national meeting. But like 
others in the bar -- like many people looking at the abortion wars in the 
country as a whole -- he remains unclear as to just how deep the schism really 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I am frankly confused. I cannot read this issue," he said. "There are those on 
both sides who feel deeply -- feel very, very deeply. But as to the numbers on 
each side who feel that way, I can't begin to estimate. It's very peculiar."

SINGLES CLUB COOKS UP SOCIAL IDEA; 
</P>
<P>
MIXING: GROUP OF PEOPLE HOPING TO CONNECT WITH FRIENDS OR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS 
FORM A VALLEY CHAPTER THAT PROVIDES A WAY TO AVOID TV DINNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As anyone who's single knows, solo diners seem as welcome to restaurateurs as 
an outbreak of salmonella. It takes a courageous heart and a very hungry 
stomach for a single diner to brave the steely eyes of a restaurant maitre d' 
inquiring, "Only ONE for dinner?" 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Gwen Minick of Calabasas found herself single again after her 
husband rediscovered his high school sweetheart. Exploring ways to get back 
into the social swing, she soon came upon a Los Angeles-based group known as 
Single Diners Social Club. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked what I saw," said Minick, who approached the group's founder, Marilyn 
Wolff, about starting a San Fernando Valley chapter of the club. 
</P>
<P>
Minick, an educator and administrator at a private school in the Valley, said 
she did research with single parents at the school and found a common complaint 
-- "the drudge of working all day, coming home to the children and never having 
any social life. So I knew that there was a need for something like the Single 
Diners Social Club with activities that are Valley-based." 
</P>
<P>
The new Valley group had its first dinner in late June and plans a second one 
Saturday at Breakers Seafood Restaurant in Northridge, Minick said. 
</P>
<P>
Singles like structured social events, said Dr. Marilyn Ruman, a clinical 
psychologist in Encino, because "adults find it uncomfortable to use meat 
market facilities or the bar scene. These days, safety is just as important a 
factor as finding intimacy. And when there is a focal point of interest, an 
activity such as dining, people immediately have a common connecting point. An 
activity club puts the activity first and foremost so personal rejection is not 
paramount." 
</P>
<P>
The 700 current active members of Single Diners Social Club now have the option 
of attending either Los Angeles- or Valley-based events. Minick said the Valley 
chapter is scheduling at least two dinner get-togethers each month at which she 
and Wolff will be hosts. 
</P>
<P>
For a $50 annual membership, Single Diners Social Club participants receive a 
monthly newsletter on upcoming activities. When Wolff started in 1987, she was 
arranging just one get-together a month, but today the events are weekly. Each 
participant pays for dinner, which ranges from $25 to $40. Other upcoming 
Valley events include patio dining at the Airtel Plaza Hotel on Aug. 2 and a 
dinner and horseback ride at the B&amp;B Ranch in West Hills on Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Events average 35 attendees, with some special events attracting more than 50. 
</P>
<P>
The mix of participants ranges from art gallery sales people and doctors to 
secretaries and business owners. "Some members also use the group for business 
as well as social networking," Wolff said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Gertler, a freight management consultant from Tarzana, said his joining 
the Valley chapter doesn't mean that he's "under any illusion or delusion that 
any one group will satisfy what I'm looking for. I've been single a long time, 
and I'm associated with several different singles groups, so the Single Diners 
Social Club is just another venue for me to meet people. And I happen to like 
dining out. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a saying, 'I never eat, I dine.' And I don't like dances with loud 
music where it's hard to talk to and meet people." 
</P>
<P>
Another Valley participant, a marketing manager from Canoga Park who asked that 
his name not be used, was hesitant to give the group his approval, but said: 
"The people I met were very nice and the event was nicely organized with a 
festive atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Minick and Wolff caution club members not to join with stars in their eyes 
about romance: "We're not a dating service," Wolff said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is to have everyone at the end of the evening walk out of the 
restaurant feeling good," she said. "As far as I'm concerned, club activities 
are the next best thing to hosting a dinner party at my own home." 
</P>
<P>
"We're encouraged to see a lot of enthusiasm for our first Valley chapter 
dinner and a pretty evenly balanced turnout," Minick added. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, it is estimated that as many as one out of two adults 
is either single, widowed or divorced. And in the continuing search to connect 
with friends or significant others, group activities such as the Single Diners 
Social Club provides seem a legitimate way to avoid TV dinners and the tube. 
</P>

Dr. Michael Glasser, medical director of the Mental Health Center at Encino 
Hospital, agreed, noting that "any environment that allows people to meet on a 
continuing basis with the same circle of people, around events that are not a 
one-shot deal, seems to work best at helping single people connect in Los 
Angeles."

FRAME FAME; 
</P>
<P>
PACOIMA BIKES GO WORLDWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's not the kind of neighborhood that conjures up images of bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
This section of Pacoima looks like a model for bad zoning laws. Small 
wood-frame houses are mixed in with factories, warehouses and discount auto 
dismantlers. The cement streets are cracked from the weight of big trucks. The 
air has a chemical sting. It's the kind of place bicyclists find themselves 
when the ride has gone bad and they're hopelessly lost. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the end of the world," John Slawta said, "but you can see it from 
here." 
</P>
<P>
However, it's in this end of the Valley that the 28-year-old Slawta has chosen 
to make some of the most sought-after bike frames in the world. These frames go 
from Pacoima to the Tour de France, to Italy for the Giro d'Italia and to 
Montana for Harrison Ford. These are Landshark bikes -- custom-made and very 
custom painted. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is definitely ugly," Slawta said as he stands in the doorway of the 
850-square-foot industrial space on Montague Street that he rents for $595 a 
month. The low-slung multitenant building could be mistaken for a personal 
storage company. 
</P>
<P>
"You see that power plant over there? I figure how smoggy it is by how much 
detail I can see on it. Today is definitely ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Ugly day or not, Slawta has six bikes to get ready to ship this week. "I keep 
it at six," he said. "It gives me goal and it's a reasonable number to get 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Because he makes and paints the bikes himself, six of the $760 frames -- this 
is just for the frame, serious cyclists add their own wheels, brakes, gears and 
other components -- are more than enough to keep him busy for the week. 
</P>
<P>
He crosses the cement-floored room strewn with the odd, specialized tools of 
the bike-makers trade. On the wall are postcards and letters racers have sent 
him from around the world. A letter written in 1988 on the cheap stationery of 
a hotel in Belgium is from Andy Hampsten, now one of the top American riders. 
It begins, "Thanks for the bitchin' bike" and ends "my season is coming." Later 
that year he won the Giro d'Italia riding one of Slawta's bikes. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of all this casually placed machinery is an $8,500 frame 
fixture, which doesn't look very impressive. It's a holding device that 
precisely aligns the tubing while it is being joined together, but it's so 
basic it could have been designed in the 19th Century. The frame-builder's art 
doesn't rely on high-tech computerized gizmos. It's the work of the seasoned 
craftsman who combines mechanical talents with the right artistic touch. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the quality control over here," Slawta said as he bends the rear part 
of an almost-finished frame, measuring with oddly shaped tools as he goes 
along. "You get them straight -- or straight enough." 
</P>
<P>
Straight enough must satisfy the professional riders and fanatic amateurs who 
are Slawta's clients, including actor Michael Nouri, Olympic volleyball 
superstar Karch Kiraly, ex-Laker Billy Thompson and former San Francisco 49er 
Dwight Clark. Getting the frame aligned perfectly is something they -- and 
Slawta -- take extremely seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The Prestige tubing he uses in making the frame is tricky to handle. The center 
parts of the tubes are thinner than the ends, to make it lighter. The ends are 
thicker where the tubes are brazed together (the metal is too heat-sensitive 
for welding). As he tinkers with the rear part of the triangular frame the 
metal seems to have a life of its own. He pushes it, it bounces back. 
</P>
<P>
"These frames have a lot of spring in them," he said. He is surrounded by an 
assortment oddly shaped tools, all of which have some specialized purpose in 
measuring frame alignment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a frame-builders scale," he said as he attaches the frame to the 
hand-held device. "You know a fisherman's scale makes everything weigh more," 
he said, "this one makes it weigh less." 
</P>
<P>
Joking about frame weight would be heresy to his clients. In the world of 
top-level bikes, less is definitely more. Racers are looking for the tiniest 
edge. In last year's Tour de France, Greg LeMond made a phenomenal comeback on 
the last day, winning by a few seconds. Some credit the victory to a new type 
of handlebars he used that allowed him to lean forward and be more aerodynamic 
as he pedaled. The tradition-bound French had dismissed the bars as just 
another American gadget. 
</P>
<P>
Slawta walks next door to a shop that makes fluorescent lights for the movie 
industry to use their photocopying machine. While he's there he picks up an 
order that's been faxed from Canada. At the rate of 300 bikes a year selling 
for $760 each it's easy to figure that one of these days he's going to be able 
to afford his own fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
Placing the fax on the rack on which he's just been straightening frames, he 
mulls over the numbers of the frame geometry -- how long the customers wants 
the top tube, the seat tube, the angle of rake for the front wheel forks. All 
of this is critical in deciding how the bike will ride. 
</P>
<P>
Bikes used for touring are a little more slung out, like a large car with a 
generous chassis. Racing bikes are tighter, stiffer, sometimes even a little 
"twitchy" -- too responsive, like a sports car with a too tight suspension 
system. 
</P>
<P>
There's a strong scent of paint in the shop that's beginning to irritate his 
visitor's throat. When it's brought to his attention Slawta looks up from the 
fax, said he doesn't notice any paint smell, then looks up again. "That's kind 
of scary, isn't it?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Slawta has been around paint so much that he's become oblivious to it. In fact, 
it was painting that originally brought the Landshark much of its fame. Slawta 
once planned to attend Pasadena's Art Center College of Design. He now 
expresses himself artistically with his bike frames. At a time when most bikes 
were in staid, traditional colors, his frames looked like a modern art show on 
wheels. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to get people to react," Slawta said. "I like people to see the 
bikes and have to respond." 
</P>
<P>
Some frames are done in a pattern of Jackson Pollock-style drips, others evoke 
the bright patterns of surfing clothes. There are amoebas and patterns that 
wouldn't seem out of place on a Amazon Indian's face. 
</P>
<P>
"I like people to look at my paint jobs and not know how I did it, even though 
it only took minutes to make," Slawta said. "It's one of those things that to 
do it right you have to do it quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Slawta has spent almost his entire life in the Valley, but by the end of the 
year he plans to move to southern Oregon. He does not know anyone there, he 
said, but he feels the rural atmosphere will be a more creative place to work. 
And since four out of five orders for his frames come from out of state, he's 
not tied to Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to miss the convenience of living here," he said, looking out the 
door at the power plant. "But if you've a chance to do things better, do it 
now. The meter's running."

A MAN WITH A MISSION TO REPAIR AND RESTORE; 
</P>
<P>
HISTORY: SCHOLAR NORMAN NEUERBURG IS RETURNING THE CALIFORNIA LANDMARKS TO 
THEIR ORIGINAL, AND SURPRISINGLY COLORFUL, SPLENDOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Norman Neuerburg is a man with a mission. Actually, he's a man with many 
missions: Mission San Juan Capistrano, Mission San Juan Bautista, Mission Santa 
Barbara, Mission San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Puns aside, Neuerburg is a multifaceted scholar who in retirement has returned 
to the first scholarly love of his life -- the California missions. 
Specifically, the study and restoration of their startlingly colorful interior 
decor. 
</P>
<P>
Colorful? Every kid who ever toured a mission on a grade-school field trip came 
away with indelible impressions of . . . drab whitewashed walls, red tile 
rooftops, dreary, dusky rooms with sorry mannequined representations of friars 
and Indians engaged in "mission life." Hardly anything that could be described 
as colorful. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, were any of those bored field-trippers to today tour the gran sala of 
Mission San Fernando Rey de Espana, known more familiarly to Valley residents 
as the San Fernando Mission, they would drastically revise their opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"At least a third of the rooms in this building had extensive painted 
decoration," said Neuerburg, standing in the gran sala, or great reception 
room. 
</P>
<P>
"Old photographs I have seen showed the Valley to be relatively empty and 
desolate except for the green of the orchards around the missions," he 
continued. "Travelers would come over the hill into the Valley and step through 
the door here and into this wonderful room. It must have been a real high. And 
I realized this was why they did it!" 
</P>
<P>
The room is elegant. A rosy pink dado with a vine and flower pattern wraps 
around all four walls up to about knee level. A brick red sawtooth pattern 
arches above two doorways. Long, sky-blue rectangles -- meant to suggest 
stonework -- emanate from the window frames and the main doorway. A pastel-blue 
seashell is centered above one archway; an Indian figure wielding a bow and 
arrow stands at eye level to the left of another. Completed in 1989, it is an 
exact replica of the decor of the room when the mission was in its prime in the 
1820s, a detailed re-creation of the work of the original Indian interior 
designers. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the work was done by Indians," Neuerburg, 64, said. "The shell has a 
Christian symbolism. It's a symbol of baptism, and baptism is a ritual for 
entering into the church. Also, it's a symbol of pilgrimage. The one bit of 
decoration in this room that is a non-Christian symbol, that is Indian, is the 
little figure with the bow next to the door." 
</P>
<P>
The figure was a motif added by an Indian for purely decorative purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic feature in the gran sala is the wall painting above the 
doorway immediately opposite the entrance -- a primitive but festive depiction 
of Indian "grape barbers" harvesting grapes for the mission's main product -- 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
"That's California's first 'Chamber of Commerce' painting," Neuerburg said with 
a laugh. He was also responsible for restoring a number of historical artworks 
hanging at the mission (one was found down the street on the back of a "Hay for 
Sale" sign). "It's a particularly interesting painting because it's one of the 
few done on walls in the missions that represents a scene. Practically all the 
other decorations are just decorative. This painting said to visitors, 'This is 
the thing that we're most proud of.' " 
</P>
<P>
Re-creating the decorations required some inventive techniques. First, 
Neuerburg had his own expertise to draw upon. He's a Valley native -- born on 
Chiquita Street in North Hollywood in a house built by his father -- and a 
visitor to the mission since the late '30s. Neuerburg was a tour guide at the 
San Fernando edifice at age 15, and helped work on a 1941-42 mission 
restoration project. His initial enthusiasm was fueled by an inspirational 
junior high school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
For the restoration, Neuerburg relied on his precise memories and notes on how 
the mission appeared at that time, because it still was much as it had been in 
terms of decoration at the time it was completed in the early 1800s. He also 
utilized his dedicated study of California history, his knowledge of painting, 
art and archeology -- he studied painting in Rome on the GI Bill after World 
War II, was a longtime professor of art at Cal State Dominguez Hills, and is 
considered an expert in Roman archeology. 
</P>
<P>
"After the '71 earthquake, they came through the mission and replastered. They 
put on chicken wire and about three-quarters of an inch of plaster over 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
When San Fernando Mission Msgr. Francis Weber asked Neuerburg to do the 
renovation, "I hoped to be able to uncover the grape harvest painting. Although 
I found a little bit of the flowers in the lower part, I found that most of it 
had been destroyed by the nailing in of the chicken wire. So what I did, in 
effect, was to base the new painting on the photograph that I had from the 
'40s. There were a few color photos, but I remembered enough about it. In 
certain other things, for instance, for some of the doorway embellishments, I 
have straight-on photographs, so I could actually project a slide onto the wall 
and trace the design." 
</P>
<P>
Neuerburg's expertise and enthusiasm is such that he has found himself in the 
rare position of researcher and restorer -- not only at San Fernando, but in 
other California missions. His re-creation of the designs inside the church at 
San Juan Capistrano led him to a precarious Michelangelo position -- laying 
flat on his back on top of a scaffold, painting the ceiling. He has uncovered 
dadoes and wall patterns at Mission San Juan Bautista in Hollister, Calif., and 
left his historically correct mark on the Santa Barbara mission as well. But 
perhaps none of the work he has done has been as involved as his efforts to 
re-create the so-called "Governor's Room," which also happens to be at the San 
Fernando Mission. 
</P>
<P>
"This," he said, no pride affecting his scholarly narration, "was the most 
elaborately decorated of any room outside of the church in a California 
mission, and it was pretty elaborate." 
</P>
<P>
And, indeed, so it is again. Although it is unlikely a governor ever stayed in 
the room (the government and the missions were politically at odds, Neuerburg 
is quick to point out), the corporal of the mission guard was housed there, and 
he was treated to a busy wall scene of great Tuscan columns, archways, an 
intricate floral border above a marbled dado and a six-petaled flower topping 
the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
Although he sometimes had to make educated guesses as to particular colors, 
Neuerburg's theories about the missions having been proudly decorated are 
anything but speculation. 
</P>
<P>
Other mission experts have taken issue with his ideas -- usually to be 
effectively rebuffed. As Weber put it, "Although you might not always agree 
with him, you'd better have a good reason for disagreeing. He's the kind of guy 
who would go on 'Jeopardy!' and walk away with the place." 
</P>
<P>
Among the pains Neuerburg went to in his research were to locate and read all 
existing mission records he could find -- in Spanish. (Neuerburg, who also 
knows his way around Italian, German, French and ancient Greek -- his major at 
UCLA -- is currently mastering Catalan, a language of Spain used extensively in 
California missions.) 
</P>
<P>
"He has spent hours and hours and hours in what survives of California missions 
documents and records," said historical editor Ed Carpenter, formerly with the 
Huntington Library in San Marino and a friend of Neuerburg's since the late 
'40s. "For instance, he has studied the 'bills of lading' -- the supply 
requisitions -- for what the missionaries ordered from Mexico on the annual 
supply ship. And he said, 'After all, they didn't order 20 kegs of vermilion 
paint if they weren't going to use vermilion paint!' " 
</P>
<P>
In the early '70s, Neuerburg was the adviser on historical architecture to the 
J. Paul Getty Museum, and is responsible for the Roman architecture there -- a 
task that plunged him into a storm of criticism. Having had his fill of 
controversy, he returned to his boyhood love, the California missions -- never 
anticipating the extent to which he would become involved in their restoration. 
He has published two books about them: "The Decoration of the California 
Missions" and "Saints of the California Missions." 
</P>
<P>
"I had dreaded the difficulty of doing the actual painting, but . . . I found 
myself getting into the spirit of the original artist, and I thought the actual 
painting work was really exciting to do. I ended up enjoying it more than 
anything else," he said, standing on the cool, red tile floor of the gran sala. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have the guts to take an interest in something, it's surprising what 
will happen. I found there were so many things I thought I couldn't do in my 
life, that I found that I could, and that's a message that I like to get across 
to young people." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, without the risks taken by Norman Neuerburg, the loving, colorful 
efforts of scores of long-dead native California artists would be forever lost.

OLYMPIC GOLD HELPS SET PACE FOR YOUNG BIKERS TO ENJOY SAFE FUN

Not all the gold left Los Angeles after the 1984 Olympics. Some of it stayed in 
Encino to fund a youth cycling program at the velodrome in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
The gold came in the form of the Games' unexpected $250-million surplus. Forty 
percent of those funds were set aside for youth sports programs in Southern 
California. One of those athletic projects was founded by Rick Denman to teach 
bicycle training and safety at the velodrome. The four-week, twice-a-week 
sessions for youngsters include helmets, gloves and coaching on standard 
brakeless, gearless track-racing bikes. For anyone 18 and younger, there's no 
charge for either the coaching or the use of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't assume everyone will become a velodrome racer," said Denman, who 
instructs the course. "But a velodrome is the best place for someone to be 
introduced to cycling. It's a controlled environment -- no cars, no potholes. 
And no matter how fast anyone goes, they still go around in circles. They're 
never far from a qualified coach." 
</P>
<P>
It's on the velodrome's sloping, bowl-shaped track that Denman teaches the 
essentials of proper bike fit, correct position and control, group riding and 
drafting -- riding close to the rear wheel of another cyclist for the advantage 
it offers in saving energy. "It's not all about racing," Denman said. "It's 
about how to be a better, more efficient cyclist. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people with a 9-to-5 job think that all they can do is ride a 
stationary bike," Denman said. "Here we've got a place with lights, no 
potholes, and you can go as fast as you can." 
</P>
<P>
The Encino velodrome, near the corner of Louise Avenue and Oxnard Street, is 
open only when supervisors are present. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like a bike path around the Sepulveda Basin," instructor Ray Joiner 
said. "If it was just open to the public, people would get hurt. It's the 
steepness of the banking that makes that true." 
</P>
<P>
The velodrome also offers adult sessions, similar to the youth sessions, for 
$55. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on either youth or adult programs and the hours the 
velodrome is available, call from Denman at (818) 899-2648 or the velodrome at 
(818) 881-7441. BILL HIGGINS

HOUSE REPUBLICANS SEEK NEW IMAGE FOR NEA; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: NEW PROPOSAL URGES THE ENDOWMENT CHIEF TO ACT AS A NATIONAL ARBITER OF 
OBSCENITY. MEANWHILE, SEN. PETE WILSON BREAKS HIS SILENCE ON THE ARTS 
CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
House Republicans, trying to fashion National Endowment for the Arts 
legislation that will have broad GOP appeal, unveiled a revised plan Wednesday 
that would require the endowment to "assure" Congress it will not support art 
that is obscene or offensive on religious, racial or ethnic grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican plan would also position the chairman of the NEA as a national 
arbiter of obscenity -- but at the same time impose on the endowment's top 
official the requirement that such decisions be made on the basis of local 
obscenity standards from any community in the country where potentially 
controversial NEA-funded art may appear. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, meanwhile, Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) -- breaking a long public 
silence on the arts endowment controversy -- said through an aide that 
prospects for legal controls over the content of federally funded art are so 
certain to be enacted that commenting on proposals to spare the NEA such 
regulation would not "relate to reality." 
</P>
<P>
The views of Wilson -- who has avoided public discussion of the NEA controversy 
as he campaigns for governor in California -- were discussed by Ira Goldman, a 
Wilson assistant who said he spoke for the senator on the issue, and that 
Wilson had held intense and lengthy discussions among his staff over the NEA 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"(Sen. Wilson) believes very strongly that the federal government should fund 
the arts," said Goldman. "He's just as clear on the view that a decision by the 
government to fund certain (art) projects and not fund others is a matter of 
good government and not censorship." 
</P>
<P>
But Goldman said Wilson's perception of the NEA's practical chances of 
surviving without sharp content controls are so remote that they have become 
"hypothetical questions which are so unlikely to ever come to pass that there 
is no need to answer them." 
</P>
<P>
The House proposal in question is a revised version of a plan originally 
advanced several weeks ago by Reps. Tom Coleman (R-Mo.) and Steve Gunderson 
(R-Wis.) that would also radically restructure the arts endowment -- altering 
the fundamental system of public funding of the arts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's version, however, includes a variety of changes and focuses the 
Coleman-Gunderson plan on the sensitive issue of statutory language to control 
the content of NEA-funded artworks. It appeared as the clearest indication yet 
of the fate that may await the arts endowment -- at least in the House, where a 
final vote on legislation to renew its legal mandate is expected before the 
scheduled start of Congress' August recess two weeks from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
NEA reauthorization is less far along in the Senate, where an effort has been 
under way for at least three weeks to fashion a bipartisan consensus that could 
appeal, essentially, across both parties and isolate extreme conservatives led 
by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every knowledgeable observer in the House and Senate has assumed for 
weeks that the most significant question about the legislative reauthorization 
of the arts endowment is not whether, but how, the NEA will be restricted in 
terms of the subject matter of art it can fund. 
</P>
<P>
In that context, the emergence of the new Coleman-Gunderson proposal was seen 
as another element in an increasingly complex and delicate process of building 
a consensus -- first among Republicans and, later, with Democrats, too -- for 
reshaping the NEA. "We have tried to structure the bill in the most logical 
way," Coleman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable sources both at the arts endowment and in Congress said the House 
Rules Committee has scheduled a meeting next Tuesday to make final plans for 
regulating floor debate over the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
Tactically, the Republican effort appeared intended to unite a broad range of 
the party and isolate the GOP right -- led by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long 
Beach), who has released draft wording to make illegal the federal funding of a 
broad range of offensive, indecent and controversial art. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday afternoon, the Coleman-Gunderson plan was under discussion among the 
House GOP leadership. House Republican Whip Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) 
scheduled a staff meeting to discuss his position on the proposal. A spokesman 
for Rep. Robert Michel (R-Ill.), the House minority leader, said Michel had not 
made a final decision on NEA strategy but "will probably support" the new 
Coleman-Gunderson plan. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the new proposal: 
</P>
<P>
* Requires the arts endowment to "assure" Congress it will fund only artworks 
that respect "the cultural heritage of the United States, its religious 
traditions or racial or ethnic groups and does not violate prevailing standards 
of obscenity." The language is similar to wording proposed by Rep. Paul Henry 
(R-Mich.), but a spokesman said Henry had withheld support. "I find the 
language inadequate," said Henry Wednesday, adding he would offer his own on 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
* Establishes a system in which the NEA chairman is prohibited from supporting 
obscene artworks as defined under a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a case 
called Miller vs. California. The case held that there could be no nationwide 
definition of obscenity and that such issues could only be decided by local 
communities. The Republican plan would require the chairman to make national 
decisions on NEA grants on the basis of his perceptions of local standards. 
</P>
<P>
* Divide the NEA's budget so states would get a total of 60% of the endowment's 
money -- another variant on earlier versions of the Coleman-Gunderson plan. But 
the new proposal eliminates a controversial requirement that would have set 
$50,000 as the minimum amount of an NEA grant -- a restriction that would have 
eliminated nearly 90% of all individual endowment grants, including the entire 
program of NEA grants and fellowships to individual artists.

STAGE WATCH: CITY COUNCIL VOTES INTERIM SUPPORT FOR L.A. THEATRE CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS FUNDING: AN UPCOMING REPORT ON THE SPRING STREET FACILITY WILL BE A KEY 
INDICATOR OF THE FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles Theatre Center got a new lease on life -- through October -- when 
the Los Angeles City Council voted 9 to 3 Tuesday to approve $750,000 for the 
building's operating costs and debt service. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it was clear that a report on the future of the four-theater 
facility at 517 S. Spring St., due by the end of September, looms ever larger 
as the key indicator of what will happen to LATC. 
</P>
<P>
Council members who voted with the majority repeatedly referred to the 
importance of hearing what's in the report, which is being written by a study 
group appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley, before making a long-term decision about 
LATC. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to re-visit our commitment" to LATC, said Councilwoman Gloria Molina, 
but she also spoke of "maintaining this important theater in this city and 
having experts tell us how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Robert Farrell and Michael Woo tried, without much success, to 
extract hints of what the study group is doing out of William Wingate, the 
consultant who heads the group. Wingate maintained that "it's too early to come 
to conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
Three councilmen -- Zev Yaroslavsky, Marvin Braude and Ernani Bernardi -- were 
unwilling to wait for the report and voted "to pull the plug," in Yaroslavsky's 
words. "What are you going to have in four months (the amount of time the study 
group is taking to prepare its report)? It'll cost more to close it down in 
four months," Yaroslavsky said, adding that another $990,000 will be required 
to keep LATC's doors open from October through January. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Nate Holden offered an amendment that would stop city support after 
Dec. 31, but no action was taken on it, and Holden finally voted to approve the 
interim funding. 
</P>
<P>
The theater center's defenders said blame was being misplaced. "They haven't 
failed," said Councilman Hal Bernson. "The city council and the CRA (the city's 
Community Redevelopment Agency, which has channeled $20 million into LATC as 
part of a plan to redevelop the surrounding neighborhood) have failed (to 
revitalize the area). The Theatre Center is a very accomplished group. We 
should be proud to have them." 
</P>
<P>
If the theater were located elsewhere, Bernson noted, it wouldn't ask for so 
much city money. "Are we willing to pull the plug on Spring Street?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Braude took seriously the suggestion that LATC should move to a better 
neighborhood. "Perhaps some programs should be housed elsewhere, not where we 
have this terrible indebtedness." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's reasonable to ask any theater group to handle the debt 
burden of that facility," said Councilwoman Joy Picus, an LATC subscriber, 
"particularly one that's operating in an area that's less than desirable. I 
don't love being in that area at night. . . . It's a wonder you have the 
audiences you do have. 
</P>
<P>
"Some serious errors were made in the original calculations" of when LATC could 
be self-sustaining at its current address, Picus said. But such errors are not 
sufficient reason to reverse course now, she added. She commended theater 
officials for doing "a noble job in making the (programming) operations 
reasonably self-supporting." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky expressed confidence that the city could continue to revitalize 
Spring Street without LATC, and he questioned the extent of the city's 
commitment to the facility. "No one had the nightmare that it would end up 
costing $21 million. If the commitment is to the building," he suggested, "we 
could do something more profitable with it or sell it." 
</P>
<P>
He also criticized LATC advocates' separation of the theater's programming 
costs from its building costs. When measuring city support of other arts 
groups, he said, "we don't segregate the rent subsidies from the salaries of 
the artists." 
</P>
<P>
As he did at a committee meeting two weeks ago, Yaroslavsky claimed that "other 
legitimate arts organizations" are protesting the amount of city money 
requested by LATC. "In the arts community," he said, the issue has become "a 
cryingstock." 
</P>
<P>
Yet he didn't name any protesting arts groups, nor did his spokeswoman respond 
to a request for names. 
</P>
<P>
The only representative of another arts group who showed up to address the 
council Tuesday came to praise LATC, not to bury it. Nobu McCarthy, artistic 
director of East West Players, called LATC "a burning light in an otherwise 
dark and unfriendly area" and "an institution that is not afraid to take 
chances and break new ground." 
</P>
<P>
IRVING AT DOOLITTLE: Amy Irving will star in "The Heidi Chronicles" when it 
opens its national tour at the Doolittle Theatre on Oct. 14, as part of the 
Ahmanson-at-the-Doolittle season. 
</P>
<P>
That season generated nearly $1.3 million in subscription renewals on Monday 
alone, easily breaking the theater's previous one-day subscription-renewal 
record of $604,017, set on July 3, 1989. Apart from enthusiasm for the 
programming, which was announced more than a month ago, a theater spokesman had 
no explanation for the jump in sales. 
</P>
<P>
The Doolittle has a new general manager, Douglas C. Baker, most recently 
company manager of "Prelude to a Kiss" on Broadway. He replaced Veronica 
Claypool, who took a film industry job. 
</P>
<P>
MORE MANAGER NEWS: The Nederlander-owned theaters -- the Pantages, Wilshire and 
Fonda -- also have a new general manager: Norman Maibaum, formerly the manager 
at the Westwood and then the Coronet. The Nederlander theaters were formerly 
managed by Dixie Burton, now Nederlander's director of special events. 
</P>
<P>
FROM PIER TO PARK: Santa Monica has moved its city-sponsored summer theater 
from the Santa Monica Pier to a beachside park just north of Ocean Park Blvd. 
At 6 tons, the city's new $50,000 mobile stage is too heavy for the pier, said 
a spokeswoman for the city's Cultural Dept. 
</P>
<P>
This year's show will be "Late Breaking Muse," conceived by Mums co-founder 
Nathan Stein. It will open Aug. 4 and play Saturdays and Sundays at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
PAY WHAT YOU CAN: You may choose your own ticket price for the July 29 and Aug. 
1 evening performances of "Miss Evers' Boys" at the Mark Taper Forum. Tickets 
go on sale Sunday at the Taper box office on a cash-only basis, limited to two 
per person.

SOVIET STRING QUARTET MAKING ITS INAUGURAL U.S. TOUR; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: ALTHOUGH IT SPECIALIZES IN DMITRI SHOSTAKOVICH, THE GROUP'S REPERTORY 
EXTENDS TO SEVERAL OTHER RUSSIAN COMPOSERS. 
</P>

Sometimes things take longer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three years ago at Moscow Conservatory, four students formed the 
Shostakovich String Quartet, eventually touring the world, receiving 
international renown and gaining a reputation as one of the foremost chamber 
music ensembles in the Soviet Union. Tonight and Saturday, at UCLA's Schoenberg 
Hall, the distinguished ensemble makes a belated Los Angeles debut as part of a 
tour billed as its first of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, as they are now saying in Russia (about the reforms), 'It's better late, 
than never,' " replied cellist Sasha Korchagin, when asked about his quartet's 
delay in performing in the United States (they performed in Hawaii and Carmel 
earlier this year as a side trip on a Canadian tour). "America is a great, 
great country, and for Soviet musicians, the chance to play here is usually the 
highlight of their careers." 
</P>
<P>
At first reluctant to carry out an interview, blaming his broken English (he is 
the only member of the quartet to claim a competent knowledge of the language), 
Korchagin eventually became quite talkative in a telephone conversation from 
Santa Fe, N.M. He and the other members of the quartet -- violinists Andrei 
Shishlov and Sergei Pishchugin and violist Sasha Galkovsky, all between 45 and 
47 -- performed there for the Sante Fe Chamber Music Festival, which has 
arranged their current tour as part of a three-year cultural exchange program 
with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we are better known abroad than at home," he said with a laugh, refering 
to their extensive touring of Europe, Australia and Canada. "Unfortunately, it 
was the political situation between our two countries that has kept us from 
performing here for so long. 
</P>
<P>
"We started to become really known around Europe when we won the first prize at 
the 19th International Munich Competition in 1970 and the first prize at the 
Leo Weiner International Competition in Budapest three years later. But when we 
started to think about coming to the United States in the late 1970s, the 
Afghanistan War started and sadly the political situation became very bad." 
</P>
<P>
Although the ensemble specializes in the 15 quartets of Dmitri Shostakovich, 
their repertory extends to several other Russian composers, as well as some of 
the major quartets of the Classical and Romantic eras. Their two programs at 
UCLA will include the third and fourth quartets of Shostakovich, the first 
quartet of Borodin, the Tchaikovsky quartet and works by two Moscow composers, 
Alexander Balashov and Vasili Lobanov. 
</P>
<P>
"Balashov was one of the original members of our quartet -- a violinist -- and 
died around 1976," Korchagin said. "Lobanov is also a very good friend of ours 
who combines several different styles." 
</P>
<P>
The Sante Fe Chamber Music Festival has already commissioned a quintet by 
Lobanov to be performed next summer by Lobanov and the Shostakovich Quartet. 
They will also take part in performances of the complete chamber works of 
Shostakovich, not only in Sante Fe, but hopefully in Los Angeles as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, our original interest in bringing the Shostakovich Quartet here to 
America wasn't a celebration of the new openness in the U.S.S.R. or debuting a 
noteworthy ensemble in America, " said Sheldon Rich, president of the Sante Fe 
Chamber Music Festival. "Those were just wonderful coincidences. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, our festival has concentrated three-year periods on the chamber 
works of Mozart and Schubert and we're emphasizing Shostakovich for these next 
three years simply because he is a great composer. We listened to several 
Soviet ensembles and liked the Shostakovich Quartet the best."

FIRE CREW RESTORED; TAXES, FEES INCREASED;

<P>
GLENDALE: THE CITY COUNCIL TINKERS WITH ITS $265-MILLION BUDGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A divided Glendale City Council concluded a boisterous seven-week budget debate 
Tuesday by restoring a fire crew cut last month, boosting water and electricity 
rates, imposing a new tax on cable television users and raising the tax on 
hotel guests. 
</P>
<P>
To meet a deadline imposed by the City Charter, the council on June 26 adopted 
a $265-million budget for the fiscal year that began July 1. Since then, 
council members have continued to tinker with spending and fee proposals in the 
budget's general fund, which is supported largely by local taxes and pays for 
services such as City Hall operations, public safety, parks and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Council members had complained that City Manager David Ramsay's proposed 
$79.1-million general fund called for spending $9 million more than last year. 
After a series of council votes on Tuesday, the 1990-91 general fund was 
established at $78 million -- $1.1 million lower than Ramsay's original 
spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
The council restored a 15-firefighter Montrose ladder-truck crew it had cut 
June 26 -- one day before Glendale's worst fire destroyed 46 homes. Council 
members, who initially believed that the cut would save almost $1 million, said 
last week that they were misinformed about the duties of the fire crew and the 
amount of money that would be saved. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's votes, they approved a new 7% fee that will add about $1.50 to the 
average cable television user's bill. They approved fee increases that will 
boost the average resident's electric bill by about $1 and the average water 
bill by almost $2 per month. They also raised the bed tax charged to hotel 
guests in Glendale from 7% to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The council increased from 3% to 5% of gross revenues the cable television 
franchise fee charged to Sammons Communications. This hike could be passed on 
to Glendale residents served by Sammons and further increase their cable bills. 
</P>
<P>
"The budget is in," Mayor Larry Zarian said wearily, after the votes. "I guess 
it's been approved." After the meeting, he added, "I'm not as pleased as I 
could be." 
</P>
<P>
Zarian said he objected to raising the bed tax and opposed leaving a $715,000 
unallocated contingency fund to cover unexpected expenses, even though the city 
has millions of dollars in reserve accounts that could be used for emergencies. 
In both cases, Zarian was outvoted. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Carl W. Raggio supported the contingency fund, pointing out that the 
city had just been forced to spend $50,000 from such a fund for expenses 
related to the recent hillside fire. "I feel that we're going to have a tough 
summer, and we ought to have it there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At a budget review session on Friday, the council unanimously endorsed 
reinstatement of the Montrose fire crew. At that meeting the council agreed to 
alternate budget cuts, including $150,000 in police equipment and $100,000 
earmarked for employee training. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg voted against this package of spending revisions 
Tuesday because she opposed most of the tax and fee increases used to balance 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
These revisions left the contingency fund of $715,000. On Tuesday Councilman 
Jerold F. Milner urged that this be reduced by eliminating one of the new taxes 
proposed by the city staff. "I have a problem getting money from the people of 
Glendale to put into a budget where we really don't intend to spend it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Milner urged the council to approve the new 7% cable television users tax but 
not a related 7% tax on interstate telephone calls, which had been expected to 
generate $345,000. His motion was approved 4 to 1, with Bremberg opposing.

GRASS-ROOTS ARTS COLLECTIVE TAKES HOLD; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHLAND PARK: THE FLEDGLING GROUP IS HOUSED IN THE OLD SKATELAND BUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By URSULA WILJANEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The enthusiastic crowd of 400 that showed up at an art exhibit opening in 
Highland Park's old Skateland building on York Boulevard recently overwhelmed 
Adolfo V. Nodal, the top arts official in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Nodal, general manager of the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, said 
later that the crowd reminded him of the alternative arts movement of the 
1960s, when artists joined together to set up studios and galleries on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time we opened up this kind of place, huh?" he said to the approving 
crowd of residents and artists from throughout the Los Angeles area who had 
come to see "Dialogue: Prague/Los Angeles," a touring art exhibit that opened 
in Highland Park on July 6. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah!" the people called out. 
</P>
<P>
Nodal said in an interview that he was excited and inspired by the energy 
present at the exhibit opening. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of Nodal, who is known for wielding the arts as a tool to spur 
social change, signaled to members of Highland Park's Arroyo Arts Collective 
that their fledgling, grass-roots group had won the cherished commodity of 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
"Something like this just doesn't happen in this part of town," said an elated 
Diane Alexander, one of three co-founders of the collective, which sponsored 
the exhibit. Featuring the work of 26 Czechoslovakian and American artists, the 
exhibit also has been at the Otis/Parsons Gallery on Wilshire Boulevard and the 
Santa Monica Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit's Highland Park opening marked the arts inaugural of the 
7,000-square-foot former roller rink, which the collective has occupied for 
about three weeks with the permission of the building's owner, Disneyland 
executive Clare Graham. 
</P>
<P>
The collective, which formed 11 months ago to try to unify and revitalize 
Highland Park through the arts, was given use of the building rent-free last 
month after a friend of Graham's, local artist Larry Davis, asked him about it. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it puts Highland Park on the map," said collective co-founder Matt 
Marchand, who edits the group's newsletter. "It's the first gallery that's been 
in this community in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
But the sudden, unexpected chance to use the huge exhibition space has become 
an equally huge burden for the still-developing collective, which has grown to 
130 members. 
</P>
<P>
At the group's first membership meeting last week, Alexander announced that the 
collective must raise more than $18,000 by the end of the year to cover the 
costs of operating the building as an exhibition space. 
</P>
<P>
Among the costs are insurance, utilities, renovations -- such as track lighting 
-- and security, she said. The group is applying for nonprofit status to make 
it eligible for grant money, but in the meantime the group must rely on 
membership fees and private fund raising, Alexander said. Those fees have not 
been set. 
</P>
<P>
More uncertainty emerged when Graham, senior managing art director for 
Disneyland's entertainment/marketing division, said Monday that the collective 
needs to show him a well-thought-out plan for the building's management and use 
before he will commit it to their use. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, a sculptor who hopes to turn the building into a personal studio in 
about five years, said he is willing to let the collective use the building in 
the meantime provided they show him a good plan. So far, Graham said, he has 
heard little more than a plethora of disjointed ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Marchand acknowledged that obtaining the use of such a big building was so 
unexpected that collective members at first didn't know what to do with it. The 
group attracted the "Dialogue: Prague/Los Angeles" exhibit by advertising the 
exhibition space in its newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole idea of a building just sort of landed on top of us, and we had to 
figure out what to do," Marchand said Monday. "It's so overwhelming that we 
haven't grasped the whole reality of it yet." 
</P>
<P>
The collective's newly formed, eight-member board of directors drafted a 
proposal Monday that they will present to Graham at a meeting scheduled for 
Saturday. The proposal lists the organizational experience of its board of 
directors and describes events the group wants to host in the building. 
</P>
<P>
Painter Carol Colin, a member of the board, said she thinks the board's 
experience in arts management will allay Graham's doubts. For example, Colin 
and board member Robert Gero, who would oversee the building's day-to-day 
operation, each operated successful studios downtown before moving to Highland 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Gero said he thinks the building will allow the collective to consolidate the 
pursuit of three separate goals in one place. The collective's aims are to 
bring talent-filled shows and artists into Highland Park, to showcase local 
talent and to offer the community an arts center for art workshops, lectures 
and poetry readings. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us a focus point and it gives us a chance to really come together," 
said Gero, a sculptor. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the events the collective hopes to host in the building include Art 
Golf, a tournament in which local artists will design the holes; a masked 
costume ball for artists; a Cajun dance fund raiser; an art auction and an 
exhibition of Latino artists native to Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
Capitalizing on the visibility the building has given its group, the collective 
is pushing ahead with plans to sponsor arts events in cultural centers 
throughout the area. Two exhibits featuring Arroyo Arts Collective artists will 
open elsewhere within the next three weeks, said co-founder Hendrik Stooker, 
senior curator for Occidental College's art department. 
</P>
<P>
"New Visions of the Arroyo," which opens tonight at The Art Store Gallery in 
Pasadena, features 20 paintings, drawings and basket art pieces depicting five 
artists' impressions of the current Arroyo Seco River basin. The baskets are 
made of materials gathered in the basin, from branches to seeds, Stooker said. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibit of abstract art, "Contemporary Abstractions," features the work of 
10 local painters and sculptors and opens Aug. 5 at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
The collective's most extensive project, however, will be coordinating open 
tours of Highland Park art studios as part of the Los Angeles Festival in 
September. For a $5 fee, people will be given maps depicting all participating 
studios and describing their art, so that people can decide which studios they 
wish to see, Stooker said. About 25 studios already have signed up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The group also hopes to co-sponsor events with established cultural centers in 
the area, such as Southwest Museum, the historic Charles F. Lummis house and 
garden, and Art in the Park, a city program that exhibits artwork in parks. The 
collective co-sponsored an arts, crafts and book sale with Southwest Museum in 
the spring at the Casa de Adobe, a replica of a Spanish residence next to the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
Collective members say the arts colony they are trying to build in Highland 
Park would be an alternative to the upscale galleries and studios downtown and 
on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to be trendy," Alexander said. "They don't want to be another 
Melrose or Westwood, but more or less a small, sophisticated village with 
families."

ANNUAL QUOTA ON BUILDING PERMITS WEIGHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale officials, who have been wrestling with a zoning plan to reduce the 
number of apartments or condominiums that could be built on a single lot, 
returned their attention this month to a second growth-control tool -- a 
building cap ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Such a law would limit the number of residential building permits issued each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members have asked for both measures -- the so-called "downzoning 
program" and the building cap ordinance -- to be ready for final review at the 
end of August. Council members want to have the new limits in place before they 
lift a freeze on apartment and condominium construction enacted in September, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Both measures are aimed at reducing traffic congestion, crowded schools and 
other problems that have resulted from Glendale's boom in apartment and 
condominium construction. Councilman Jerold Milner said developers cannot be 
trusted to voluntarily refrain from constructing apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing you come down to is that all laws are written for people who cannot 
use good judgment," he said. "There does need to be a maximum on how many can 
be built at one time. Left to the free market, you run the risk of excesses 
being driven by individuals who have no concern for the overall community." 
</P>
<P>
The council finished the bulk of its work on the downzoning plan last month and 
is preparing to consider the building cap, which it instructed the staff to 
prepare last year. 
</P>
<P>
On July 9, city staff members presented the proposal to the Glendale Planning 
Commission, which will make recommendations to the council. At that meeting, no 
members of the public spoke in favor of or against the measure, under which the 
city annually would issue building permits for no more than 1,400 new housing 
units through 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members said they wanted more time to study the proposal and 
postponed a vote until a special meeting at 3 p.m. July 30. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that a building cap ordinance is one of the better ways of 
accommodating managed growth," Commissioner Don M. Pearson said. "My biggest 
concern is whether the rate is appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
The cap is designed to slow the apartment construction boom that began in 
Glendale during the 1980s. A peak was reached in 1986 when the city issued more 
than 4,500 residential building permits. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, the cap would allow schools and city services to keep up with the 
population increase. 
</P>
<P>
"It regulates the rate or pace of the city's growth," said James Glaser, a 
Glendale city planner. 
</P>
<P>
He said the measure is also designed to encourage construction of more 
affordable housing and higher-quality projects. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Glendale would annually issue building permits for up to 
740 apartment or condominium units that meet the city's definition of 
affordable housing. These would be issued on a first-come, first-served basis 
to projects in which at least half of the units are guaranteed to be affordable 
to lower-income households. 
</P>
<P>
The city would also issue permits for up to 660 units in which the rent or sale 
price would be based on prevailing economic conditions. The City Council would 
allocate these market-rate units each quarter after city staff members review 
and rank the proposed projects. 
</P>
<P>
Higher rankings would be given to apartment and condominium projects that have 
less impact on schools, parks and utility services, have plenty of off-street 
parking, make use of attractive landscaping and water-conserving plants, and 
have energy-efficient equipment such as solar heating units. 
</P>
<P>
A project would also be ranked higher if it provides for special housing needs, 
such as accessibility for disabled people and opportunities for moderate-income 
families to purchase their units. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the competition for permits will encourage developers to 
propose their best-designed projects, instead of just meeting minimum building 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Glaser said a developer could not upgrade his design immediately after it is 
reviewed in order to get a higher ranking. The developer would have to submit 
it again with modifications during the next quarter's review period. 
</P>
<P>
During a study session on the building cap proposal, Planning Commissioner Gary 
Tobian expressed concern that the additional review could pose a hardship for 
some developers. "We're adding three months to the process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Permits for single-family detached houses would be subtracted from the 660-unit 
annual allocation, but such houses would not have to undergo the ranking 
review. Some types of housing, such as hotels, affordable senior citizens 
projects and condominium conversions, would be exempt from the allocation 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Since the July 9 commission meeting, some members of Glendale's business 
community have criticized the building cap proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"If you put a cap on it, the free-market economy doesn't work," said Aulden 
Schlatter, executive vice president of the Glendale Chamber of Commerce. "I'm 
not sure you accomplish what you want to do. You trade one set of problems for 
another." 
</P>
<P>
If developers want to build more apartments or condominiums than the city 
allows, "you force the prices up for those who want to rent or buy," Schlatter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said a chamber committee is studying the building cap ordinance and will 
likely comment on it to the Planning Commission or the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is enough restriction already, enough limitations, enough 
reductions," said Hamo Rostamian, a Glendale developer and real estate broker. 
"The cap is just something that is maybe an overkill." 
</P>
<P>
Rostamian said apartment building in Glendale has already slowed considerably 
because of savings and loan scandals, financing difficulties, and rising land 
and operating costs. He estimated that there are 350 apartment buildings for 
sale in Glendale, contrasted with about 150 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not very attractive to get into building apartments in Glendale," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed building cap and its accompanying review process would further 
discourage apartment construction, Rostamian said.

SCOPE: THEY'RE UP IN YEARS, BUT KEEP SHUFFLING ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man had a stroke. Another is fighting cancer. A third is deaf. One woman is 
blind in one eye and has only partial sight in the other. A couple are grieving 
the loss of their only child. 
</P>
<P>
But for several hours a day five days a week, the 10 to 15 elderly people on 
the shuffleboard courts at the Paramount Community Center forget their ailments 
or misfortunes and concentrate on shuffleboard. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have our oddities, but this keeps us going. It's our therapy," Leona 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and her husband, Arnold, both 73, lost their only child, Luanne 
Johnson, 43, who died of an aneurysm in May. Through all of their pain, the 
game helped them endure, Arnold Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnsons are founders of the Paramount Shufflers, a 5-year-old shuffleboard 
club. They spent years lobbying city officials to improve the facilities at the 
Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
The couple and other members of the Shufflers, along with Long Beach resident 
Joy Moore, also helped organize the Houghton Park shuffleboard club in North 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
From 2:30 to about 5 p.m. each day, the Paramount Shufflers can be found 
pushing yellow and black rubber discs, which are about six inches in diameter, 
up and down the cement courts with metal-prong cue sticks. A player can score 
from 7 to 10 points when his disc lands on a certain area of the 
triangular-shaped goal. A player can prevent a score by striking his opponent's 
disc and knocking it from the triangle. 
</P>
<P>
Bad weather is the only thing that stops them. Temperatures in the 100s and 
gusty winds caused them to suspend their game one day recently. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount resident Irene Philerick, 68, who started playing in December after a 
cataract operation on her right eye, echoed the group sentiments when she said: 
"I'd rather do this than eat." 
</P>
<P>
But Philerick does eat every day at the center's Elderly Nutrition Program with 
the other players from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, before they 
retreat to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
These shuffleboard fanatics pay $5 a year to join the Paramount Shufflers. The 
money buys cookies and refreshments. Besides playing against each other, some 
of them travel to clubs in other cities to compete, while a few take part in 
statewide competition. 
</P>
<P>
"The game gets them out in the air. It occupies their time. It is also 
competitive," said Moore, 57, a former Cal State Dominguez Hills student. 
</P>
<P>
Moore met the Shufflers in the fall of 1989, while serving an internship at 
Houghton Park in North Long Beach. The internship was part of a requirement for 
Moore to receive her bachelor of arts degree in human services in June. 
</P>
<P>
"The eight courts at Houghton were in bad condition. There were no benches, no 
scoreboard or covering for shade for the players," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to Paramount to find out what shuffleboard was all about. The Paramount 
players are real nice. And they know the game. You can't go around them unless 
you play shuffleboard. They even got me to play." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that with the assistance of the Johnsons and other Paramount 
players, who went to North Long Beach and gave demonstrations, the Houghton 
Park players have been able to start a shuffleboard club. The city of Long 
Beach resurfaced the Houghton Park courts and installed benches and 
scoreboards. But the courts remain without covering, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnsons started attending the Paramount Community Center in the mid-1980s. 
The couple spent four years lobbying Paramount city officials to build wooden 
sun coverings for all of the six concrete courts. Only three courts had covers 
when the Johnsons arrived. The couple also persuaded the city to build 
additional benches. 
</P>
<P>
"The Johnsons are tough. They are persistent," Paramount Deputy City Manager 
Patrick West said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year and a half, the city has spent approximately $5,000 for 
improvements on the courts, said Richard Leahy, another deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnsons said they intend to try and get city officials to install lights 
so games can be played at night, and will ask that the area be enclosed to give 
further protection from the wind and sun. 
</P>
<P>
"We know this could take a long time. City money has to go for other things, 
but they'll finally get around to us," Leona Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Johnson is president of the Shufflers; Leona is treasurer. Together they 
act as motivators to the other players. They encourage the others to keep 
playing, and not to give in to problems. 
</P>
<P>
Hershel Sparks, 76, is one of those who was encouraged to continue playing 
after he had a stroke that affected his right upper body several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Eustolio Sanchez, who is deaf and at 92 is the oldest member, is a regular 
player. Harley Priddy, 74, the club's best player, comes from his home in 
Downey to Paramount because he enjoys the camaraderie. Priddy won a silver 
medal for second place in the Long Beach Senior Games in May. Game events 
included shuffleboard, swimming, bridge and bowling. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Calonge, 80, who started playing about three years ago after a prostate 
cancer operation, said that not only is the game therapy but it is simple. 
Anyone can play. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't take much brainpower or muscles," Calonge said. "You can waste a 
lot of time. It's a lot of fun."

4 TRAFFIC OFFICERS TRAINED TO LOOK FOR TRUCK VIOLATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Montebello Police Department, on the lookout for truck drivers who are 
breaking traffic laws, will soon begin special patrols of the city's industrial 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Michael Kight said four traffic officers recently received training from 
the California Highway Patrol in order to crack down on drivers who break the 
law by driving trucks on restricted streets or are committing other traffic 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
Montebello has several large trucking firms in its industrial area on the south 
side of town, and heavy truck traffic has prompted residents to complain about 
trucks that emit too much smoke or are disrupting peace and quiet in their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Kight said the officers will patrol periodically.

The Bluff Road bridge in Montebello, a turn-of-the century timber bridge that 
was destroyed when a firecracker ignited it in July, 1989, will be reopened 
next week after nine months of work. 
</P>
<P>
A two-lane concrete bridge with a pedestrian walkway will replace the old 
timber bridge that once crossed the Union Pacific railroad tracks beside the 
Rio Hondo south of Whittier Boulevard, said Joan Caterino, Montebello community

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: 'EVENTUALLY, IT TOOK UP THE WHOLE HOUSE. THERE WERE 
RECORD BOXES IN THE BEDROOMS, IN THE KITCHEN . . .' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A community's nagging ills can bring forth unexpected heroes, as has just been 
shown in the case of Silver Lake's notorious nightspot, Cache. 
</P>
<P>
The dance club on Glendale Boulevard closed earlier this year following a 
decade of decline marked by bankruptcy and a lot of neighborhood Angst. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, when it was the Thistle Inn, the restaurant had been a 
community and commuter gathering spot of good reputation. After its owner died 
early in the 1980s, a group of hundreds of small investors came forward to open 
Cache, which became a popular Latino nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
But Cache went bankrupt and was placed in the hands of a receiver who 
discovered that the establishment had no dance license. He applied for one, 
only to encounter an outburst of protest from neighbors over the noise, traffic 
and crime, which they believed was being caused by Cache. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Zoning Appeals turned down the application. Cache was 
put up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Long before any of that began, back in the 1970s, a hole-in-the-wall store 
called Rainbow Records opened in a shopping center a few blocks down the road, 
sandwiched between a Savon Drug Store and a Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
In those unhip environs, Rainbow Records' manager and part owner, Marty Levy, 
hung out in tie-dyed shirts, grooved on loud music, made friends with customers 
young and old and altogether presented an endearing model for how an 
unrepentant flower child with a receding hairline could work with the system. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, two brothers from Brea, Wayne and Gary Johnson, were working 
their way up in the rare record business. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more of a hobby in those days," said Wayne Johnson, who was an 
electronics technician in his early 20s then. "We started out going to garage 
sales and swap meets. My brother and I are music lovers." 
</P>
<P>
A swap meet at Capitol Records, at which records were selling for $50 and $100, 
converted them to real collectors. 
</P>
<P>
A real collector, Johnson said, buys records he doesn't intend to play, such as 
an original Beatles 45, a mint copy of which could cost $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody could play that," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
They soon discovered they had a knack for finding records that were too good to 
play. They began buying, selling and hoarding. 
</P>
<P>
"It just kept getting bigger and bigger," Johnson said. "Eventually, it took up 
the whole house. There were record boxes in the bedrooms, in the kitchen, in 
the closet. We hired our first employee." 
</P>
<P>
Their mail-order business spread around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned very quickly," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
One thing they learned was that to get some of the rare collectibles they 
wanted they had to buy large collections of mostly common records. They would 
need a retail outlet for their cheaper records. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, they bought Rainbow Records. They renamed it Rockaway but kept Levy as 
manager and resident jazz expert. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we had the retail store, we had the ability to pay a decent price on 
common records," Johnson said. "We had no idea what the market was." 
</P>
<P>
It was so good that within a year, Rockaway outgrew the 700-square-foot store. 
It moved a few doors over to a vacant dry cleaner with almost four times the 
space. When they lost their lease on that, Johnson decided it was time to buy. 
</P>
<P>
The two prime spots -- Melrose Avenue and Ventura Boulevard -- were ruled out 
as too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Wayne Johnson, who runs the business while his brother Gary sticks to 
buying records, had moved to Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stand commuting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Up the street they found what they needed in a seedy-looking bar called The 
Mixer, just across the street from Cache. It had been closed three years. 
</P>
<P>
They refinished it in bold yellow and black tile and opened April 29 last year 
to fanfare and praise from public officials for their good community work. The 
new home was only briefly adequate for an operation employing 40 people. 
</P>
<P>
"We outgrew it before we moved in," Johnson said. He now shares a cubicle of an 
office with a Beach Boys surfboard, a collector's item that he does not intend 
to take to the surf. 
</P>
<P>
The racks in their store are now mostly crammed with used CDs, which have 
become their biggest item. Aisles are lined with LPs stashed in cardboard 
boxes. In the back, the mail business has been trimmed to only the Beatles. A 
third brother handles the rest of it at the Johnsons' new store in Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the Johnsons bought a property next door, a duplex that was notorious for 
its overcrowding and late-night traffic. They tore it down to expand the store. 
</P>
<P>
Then Cache went on the market. It was just what the Johnsons needed to bring 
their two warehouses and retail store together. They bought it for just under 
$1 million. Johnson is aiming for an opening in January and is looking for a 
restaurant to take over The Mixer. 
</P>
<P>
If it all works, that would be two bars and a flophouse wiped out in just two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad piece of work for a bunch of guys who live for music.

City attorneys on Wednesday dropped noise-level violation charges against the 
owner of a Glendale batting center, saying the city's law regulating noise is 
too outdated. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors said they will file new charges if the batting cages violate an 
updated ordinance expected to be drafted by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the dismissal of the charges, David Johnson, owner of the 
Glendale Batting Cage, agreed to pay $1,152 to cover some of the costs the city 
incurred in the case, said Ron Braden, senior assistant city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Two misdemeanor counts of violating the city's noise limits were filed in 
January against Johnson after apartment dwellers behind the batting center 
complained to city officials. Two charges of displaying an illegal advertising 
sign and operating an illegal snack bar also were filed. 
</P>
<P>
All four charges were dropped Wednesday. Johnson acquired a permit for the sign 
and closed the snack bar, Braden said. He said the noise violations were 
dropped because the ordinance, enacted in the early 1960s, specified outdated 
noise measurement methods. 
</P>
<P>
Robert DePiano, Johnson's attorney, said Johnson has reduced noise by shutting 
down two batting cages closest to neighbors, covering metal surfaces frequently 
struck by baseballs and using quieter foam-filled bats and balls. Johnson will 
also meet soon with disgruntled neighbors to discuss the conflict, DePiano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, Johnson maintains that he never violated noise levels. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad for my client in this case because he has spent thousands and 
thousands of dollars showing the city they made a mistake," DePiano said. 
</P>
<P>
Braden said it is uncertain whether those modifications brought the cages into 
compliance with the current ordinance because officials have not tested the 
cages since the charges were filed. But the facility most likely will be tested 
again once a new ordinance is drafted and approved by the City Council, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said Wednesday that they are upset by the agreement between Johnson 
and the city. They said they are considering legal action to compel city 
attorneys to enforce the current ordinance and prosecute Johnson. They also 
said they will press for new noise-violation charges against the owner once an 
updated ordinance is in place. 
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of the charges "had all been agreed to privately, behind closed 
doors, without any consultation with the complaining parties," said Robert 
Paone, who lives in an apartment building behind the batting cages. "The noise 
situation has hardly abated."

INDIAN YOUTHS SAMPLE ACADEMIC BIG TIME OF ENGINEERING, SCIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: PROGRAM COLLECTS 30 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM RESERVATIONS 
THROUGHOUT U.S. AND EXPOSES THEM TO FIELDS THAT COULD BENEFIT TRIBAL LIFE.

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Indian teen-agers got their first whiff of the academic big time 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot bigger than I expected," said Becky Flynn, 16, a Cheyenne Indian 
from Watanga, Okla., midway through a guided tour of the campus at Cal State 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what surprised her the most about California, Corrine Maillelle, 15, 
a member of the Athabascan tribe of Alaska on her first trip outside that 
state, did not think too long. "Palm trees, stars in the summer and crickets," 
she replied, listing things which she said are never seen in the small village 
from which she comes. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn and Maillelle are among 30 American Indian high school students, from 
reservations throughout the United States, spending four weeks on campus this 
summer in an unusual program. Its immediate purpose, according to director Lee 
Francis, is to steer them toward careers in engineering and science, fields he 
says are woefully under-represented in tribal life. But more than that, he 
said, the experience will broaden their horizons. 
</P>
<P>
"Many students prefer their home environments," said Francis, himself a Laguna 
Pueblo/Teton Sioux and director of the university's Indian Studies program. 
"(This will give them) access to a major university." 
</P>
<P>
Paid for with a $45,000 grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation of New York and funds from the university, the program is sponsored 
by the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, a professional 
organization based in Colorado, which chose Cal State Long Beach from among 
dozens of campuses nationwide for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Although the grant pays for instruction, dormitory rooms and food, the students 
were responsible for their air fare to Long Beach. Chosen on the basis of 
academic performance and interest in science or engineering, they will receive 
five hours of instruction a day in computer science, engineering, algebra and 
calculus. In addition, Francis said, the students will go on field trips to 
area museums and amusement parks and will hear lectures from Indians who have 
succeeded in science or engineering-related fields. 
</P>
<P>
Project organizers hope that some of the students will pursue higher education 
and careers in those fields. Ultimately, they say, they would like as many as 
possible to return to their reservations and make contributions in such areas 
as building construction, water reclamation and land management. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see a lot of role models," Francis said. "What we want to do here is 
translate all of this into a tribal context." 
</P>
<P>
As part of doing that, he said, the summer courses will emphasize such Indian 
contributions to engineering as the cliff dwellings of New Mexico and Arizona, 
precursors of modern-day condominiums; the early dome structures now favored by 
some environmentally conscious developers, and early irrigation systems that 
heavily influenced those built later. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indian emphasis is respect and understanding for the earth, our mother," 
Francis said. "(The question is how to) build on that tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the students intend to use their educations exclusively for the 
benefit of their tribes or reservations, however. 
</P>
<P>
Garek Murphy, a Sioux from Fort Yates, N.D., said he hopes to become a teacher 
somewhere other than on his reservation. "The kids on the reservation have a 
bad attitude," said Murphy, 16. "I wouldn't want to teach there." 
</P>
<P>
And Delford Johnson, 16, a Navajo from Chinle, Ariz., said he too will probably 
leave the reservation on which he was raised to find better opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the youngsters say they are committed to staying. 
</P>
<P>
James Couture, a Chippewa from Duluth, Minn., said he would like to become an 
electrical engineer, then return home to put his skills to good use. "Around my 
reservation not too many Indians graduate with degrees," Couture, 16, said. 
"They mostly take jobs to support families." 
</P>
<P>
And Maillelle, the Athabascan from Alaska, said she intends to become a nurse, 
then return to her home village to serve as an example to others of what is 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The place I live is remote, and they don't know a lot about the outside 
world," Maillelle said. "It would help them to know that I got out."

GLENDALE HIT ITS STRIDE AFTER ONE-SIDED DEFEAT; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AFTER A SLOW START, AMERICAN LEGION TEAM WON 17 OF ITS LAST 19 GAMES 
TO REACH THE DISTRICT 20 POSTSEASON TOURNAMENT.

They present themselves in various guises. Sometimes, for example, they are 
subtle, almost indiscernible events or instances that spark change in an 
athletic team's performance and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Other times, they are obvious, the watershed moment that athletes can identify 
without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
Turning points, regardless of their nature, are experienced by virtually every 
baseball team during the course of a season, whether it's a 162-game major 
league schedule or 23-game American Legion calendar. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point for the Glendale American Legion team this summer came after 
an early 12-2 loss to Burbank, a defeat that dropped the talented but 
apparently uninspired Glendale club to 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
"The players and coaches spent about 30 minutes afterward addressing, 'What . . 
. . are we doing out here?' " recalled Glendale Coach Mike MacDonald. "I think 
the majority of the players made the decision, 'OK, we're going to do this 
right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Glendale went on to win 17 of its last 19 games, finishing the regular season 
18-5 and earning a berth in this week's District 20 playoffs. The playoffs are 
taking place at two sites, Birmingham High in Van Nuys and Pierce College in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The field for the eight-team, double-elimination tournament included defending 
World Series champion Woodland Hills West; Sun Valley; Quartz Hill; Woodland 
Hills East; Panorama City; Lancaster; and Saugus/Newhall in addition to 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale lost its playoff opener to Woodland Hills East, 2-1. on Tuesday. The 
team played Wednesday in an elimination game but results were not available at 
press time. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the District 20 tournament advances to the area playoffs July 
26-29 at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium. The area champion advances to the 
state tournament Aug. 4-7 in Yountville, where it will play for the opportunity 
to compete in the World Series Aug 11-14 at Corvallis, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt all along that Woodland Hills West is going to be the team to beat," 
MacDonald said. "You're talking about a team that just got finished (last year) 
winning the whole ball of wax. That type of pressure, tournament baseball is 
going to be a big plus for them." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale has been led all season by a nucleus of talented players rather than 
an individual standout. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the .500 hitter or the one or two phenoms that all the colleges 
are trying to recruit and the pros are trying to sign," said MacDonald, who is 
in his fifth season coaching the team. "That's kept us focused because we 
haven't had those kinds of interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have 17 pretty steady ballplayers." 
</P>
<P>
Leadoff batter Mike Regan, who played at Glendale College last season, has been 
the team's top hitter most of the season, batting .388 with a .517 on-base 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Cowsill, a Times' all-Glendale player from Crescenta Valley High, is 
batting .367 and, on the mound, has won seven of eight decisions while posting 
a 1.98 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Gray of Glendale High, The Times' Glendale area player of the year, is 
4-1 and former high school teammate Brent Overfelt is batting .320. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale closed its regular season with 10 consecutive victories, including 
last weekend's doubleheader sweep of Sun Valley, which entered the twin bill 
18-2. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale won the first game, 3-2, behind the four-hit pitching of Gray, then 
held off a seventh-inning rally to win the second game, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Valley Coach Les Riley was impressed, but not surprised, by Glendale's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they were going to be tough," Riley said. "They started out slowly 
with those four or five losses, but every time we looked in the paper in the 
weeks leading up to the doubleheader, they still had four or five losses." 
</P>
<P>
With the District 20 tournament under way, MacDonald is hoping his team can 
maintain its consistency and earn a spot in the area playoffs. After its 
opening loss, however, Glendale will have to accomplish it the hard way, 
passing through the losers' bracket. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale won the district tournament title in 1986 and players on this year's 
team believe they can do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to go in there (to the tournament) with a little bit of cockiness and 
let them know we're here to play," Overfelt said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had the talent. We just needed something to click and get us 
going."

BACKSTAGE: 'CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD'; 
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL INSIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
THE USE OF HEARING-IMPAIRED ACTORS PROVIDES LESSONS FOR ACTING NEWCOMERS AND 
THE DIRECTOR.

<P>
Casting the Conejo Players' production of "Children of a Lesser God," director 
John Hulette wasn't necessarily looking for actors with a hearing disability, 
even though the Tony award-winning Mark Medoff play takes place in and around a 
school for the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
The rule is, he explained recently, that "professional productions are required 
to use hearing-disabled people to play the three roles of deaf students. 
Community theater groups, like the Conejo Players, are given more latitude." 
</P>
<P>
Which may explain why, of the more than 100 inquiries he received from across 
the country -- from as far away as New York -- the majority were from hearing 
actors and actresses, ". . . what we affectionately refer to as "wannabe deaf 
girls." 
</P>
<P>
"But," he continued, "I have had no real experience with the hearing-impaired, 
and I felt that if I didn't have the experience, the actors certainly should." 
</P>
<P>
The leading role went to Kristine Finnestrom, an alumnus of the National 
Theatre of the Deaf Summer Program and secretary of the organization Hearing 
Impaired Performers. The smaller, though important roles, went to two 
hearing-impaired students from Pierce College in the San Fernando Valley, 
Teliaferro (Terry) Miller and Laura Jean Barton. Both are making their 
theatrical debuts in the production. 
</P>
<P>
"Once in a while," Hulette said as the play entered its final week, "you hook 
yourself into a natural, one who will be perfect with what they bring to it. 
And Laura and Terry were. One of the ways I know I made the right decision, in 
addition to my own pleasure with their performance, was that all of the reviews 
emphasized them strongly." 
</P>
<P>
"I went with Terry to the audition," 22-year-old Barton recalled, "changed my 
mind and went home -- I'd never done that sort of thing, and didn't think that 
I could compete with experienced, hearing actors. 
</P>
<P>
"The next day, Sherril Alstadt, one of the show's sign-language instructors, 
called and told me to go out for it, that I was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Barton plays Lydia, a flirtatious student who competes with Finnestrom's 
somewhat more mature character for the attentions of instructor James Leeds, 
played by Michael Tachco. 
</P>
<P>
"The character really matched me," Barton said with a smile. "I used to flirt, 
and I look young -- Lydia's supposed to be in her late teens. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Finnestrom, both Barton and Miller are able to hear sounds and 
comprehend speech, though with a far less than normal ability. 
</P>
<P>
Barton grew up in Van Nuys in a hearing environment and went to public schools 
-- Cal Poly in Pomona, where she studied ornamental horticulture, and now 
Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, she joined the student agricultural organization 4-H and was 
encouraged by her parents and teachers to participate in community work and 
public speaking. "But after high school," she admits, "I fell apart, because I 
was alone. I let my disability get in my way, and I shouldn't have." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 23, is from Gainesville, Fla. After losing much of his hearing in a 
childhood bout of German measles, he went to a special school, wore a hearing 
aid and took speech therapy. He's an award-winning runner and has a dance 
group, Get 'n' Bizee. 
</P>
<P>
In "Children," he plays Orin Dennis, a self-absorbed and contentious young man 
whose resentment of the treatment received by hearing-impaired people parallels 
the feelings of many persecuted minorities. As far as Miller has been able to 
determine, he is the first black actor to play the role, though the parallel is 
a right and insightful one. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had the goal of being an actor," he says. "I also wanted to be a 
singer, but knew that couldn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
In a dance contest, Miller met William Byrd, an actor who had appeared in the 
film version of "Children of a Lesser God." 
</P>
<P>
"He advised me about acting. Last year, I auditioned for three commercials: 
Swatch, milk and Jack in the Box. I lost confidence in myself when I didn't get 
any of the parts. 
</P>
<P>
"I froze onstage during the auditions for this show. It was my worst nightmare, 
coming true. I was called back to read with another actor and froze again. But 
I wound up getting the part." 
</P>
<P>
Hulette says: "One of the things that make Laura and Terry perfect is that they 
are those people. You ask Terry the right questions, Orin's answers come right 
out of him. When he understood that it would be OK to react to a situation as 
Terry would do, that's when he got the character." 
</P>
<P>
Miller admits to considerable anger. 
</P>
<P>
"The sign language I learned in Gainesville is quite different from what's done 
here -- I had learned to sign English, with each letter spelled out." 
</P>
<P>
He said ASL, or American Sign Language, which is used in the play and in Pierce 
College's program for the hearing-impaired, is shorter and more symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time a guy signed to me in it, I thought he was stupid," he said. "I 
got the hang of it, but I hated it. . . . I still hate it." 
</P>
<P>
One of the play's basic conflicts -- whether the school should be staffed 
solely by hearing-impaired teachers and administrators -- was eerily echoed 
recently by students of the Washington, D.C., college for the hearing-impaired, 
Gallaudet University. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize at first why all the deaf students were rioting," says 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out, I felt that the situation wasn't fair," he said, saying the 
school is 100 years old, and the teacher who was passed over for the presidency 
had been working there for 23 years. "The woman they hired was an outsider, who 
didn't even know how to sign -- it made me angry," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me awake," adds Barton, who, after a lifetime of lip-reading, has just 
learned American Sign Language and now divides her time between the deaf and 
hearing communities. 
</P>
<P>
"There are deaf and hearing-impaired people all over the United States, and we 
should speak up for our rights. They might not have a voice, but they should 
have a voice."

PLANS UNVEILED FOR 450-ACRE DEVELOPMENT IN MONTEBELLO HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
PLANNING: CITY COUNCIL GETS ITS FIRST LOOK AT CHEVRON'S PROPOSAL FOR AN 'URBAN 
VILLAGE' TO REPLACE FADING HILLSIDE OIL FIELD.

MONTEBELLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer has unveiled plans to replace the scrub brush and oil wells of 
Montebello Hills -- one of the last major chunks of undeveloped terrain in 
southeast Los Angeles County -- with an "urban village" of houses, townhouses 
and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
A neighborhood shopping center, parks, a school, fire station and senior 
housing also would be included in the 450-acre project planned by Chevron Land 
&amp; Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope we will be able to bring to Montebello a new and exciting community," 
said Gary Weaver, project manager for Chevron, which owns the site. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members, who viewed the plans for the first time last week, said 
development of the hills is probably the most important issue they will address 
this decade, because it will forever change the face of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the last time we will have such an opportunity," Councilman 
Art Payan said. "It will have a major impact on the quality of life in 
Montebello, whether we put in more commercial projects, more housing, more open 
space. All the possibilities will impact this city and the people who live 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The site is in a redevelopment area created by the city in 1976, which allows 
the city to participate in the planning, said Linda Payan, economic development 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron's initial plans -- which were designed by J. L. Webb Planning Inc., a 
Costa Mesa-based planning firm specializing in hillside development -- call for 
building a $600-million village of homes, townhouses and condominiums, with 
prices starting at $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The residences are to be within easy reach of a neighborhood shopping center, 
three parks, an elementary school, a senior citizen housing complex and a fire 
station. 
</P>
<P>
According to the plans, the Montebello Hills would be reshaped so that the 
village rises above the rest of the community, offering scenic views in every 
direction. Only Montebello and Paramount boulevards would run through the 
project, keeping traffic in the nearby La Merced area at a minimum and giving 
the village exclusive isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver said Chevron, which is responsible for financing the project, has been 
working on the plans for about a year. "These are very preliminary plans," he 
said. "At this point, we're basically trying to feel our way through." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver said a residential development was selected because it fits best with 
the city's zoning laws and General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
He said Chevron plans to develop the site in stages, as oil wells dry out. The 
first portion, along the northeastern slope of hills bordered by San Gabriel 
Boulevard, is scheduled to be graded in 1992. The second portion, on 
northwestern slopes south of Montebello Boulevard, is scheduled for 1995. The 
third portion, in the center, is scheduled for grading in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rogers, vice president of J. L. Webb, told council members that if the 
development were built without any changes, about 6,000 more people would be 
living in Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they are excited and impressed by the initial plans but 
expressed some reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good first offer, but I think we will hold out for more," Mayor Ed 
Pizzorno said. 
</P>
<P>
Pizzorno and council members Kathy Salazar, Payan and William Molinari said 
they are concerned that the plans would increase the population density of the 
city too much. According to the Los Angeles County Department of Regional 
Planning, as of January, 1989, Montebello was the 39th most crowded city in the 
county, with 6,800 people per square mile. The town's population is about 
57,000. Recently, the council passed a moratorium on construction in 
high-density areas to control development. 
</P>
<P>
Molinari and Pizzorno said they believe that Rogers' estimate that about 6,000 
people would move to the area, based on a calculation of 3.2 people per home, 
is too low for the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
"The demographics in this area don't support only 3.2 people per home," 
Molinari said. "What they've got planned up there gives us a density factor 
that is totally excessive. They are trying to squeeze too many homes up there." 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they want to be sure that the city's police, parks and 
recreation and other services would not be overburdened. Economic development 
chief Payan said the city is hiring a financial consultant to determine what 
additional city services would be needed with such a development. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they are also concerned that the land set aside for 
commercial development and open space may be inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
According to the plans, about 15 of the 450 acres have been set aside for 
parks. Each park averages about five acres, but one is on the elementary school 
property, so students can use the park during the day, and another holds a city 
water tank. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a minimal amount of open space," Molinari said. "It would be a tragedy 
if we didn't provide more. Even if they double it, I don't think it would be 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
The plans also call for one 15-acre neighborhood shopping center at the 
southwest corner of Montebello and Paramount boulevards, which council members 
said is not enough shopping. 
</P>
<P>
"I favor as much commercial as possible," Payan said.

IT'S NEW BALLGAME FOR ASSISTANT COACH AT L.B. CITY COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a few fleeting weeks in the fall of 1986, Chris Ferragamo sat at the top of 
the high school football world. 
</P>
<P>
His unbeaten and untied Banning High team was ranked No. 1 in the country by 
USA Today and was on the verge of winning the mythical national title. The last 
team standing in the Pilots' way was archrival Carson, which Banning had beaten 
soundly, 37-10, in league play. 
</P>
<P>
"All of our guys knew we were going to win again," Ferragamo recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the veteran coach and his players, things did not work out 
that way. Carson knocked Banning from its pedestal with a stunning 21-11 upset 
in the L.A. City Section championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began Ferragamo's swift and long fall from the coaching limelight. 
</P>
<P>
Spurned in his attempts to land a university coaching job, he left Banning to 
become coach at Harbor College in 1987. By the end of the 1988 season, he was a 
beaten man, frustrated by a system that he was unfamiliar with and stripped of 
his once-unflinching confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was a good coach, but I guess I'm not," he said after a 20-9 loss 
to Compton College on Oct. 15, 1988. "This is really the low point of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Today, he is preparing for his second season as the offensive line coach at 
Long Beach City College. It is not where Ferragamo, who once aspired to run his 
own major-college program, would have pictured himself working a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the part-time position has provided him with an avenue to exercise his 
undying love for coaching and renew his appreciation for family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"In all my years of coaching, I never spent any time with my family," he said. 
"All my time was spent with other people's children. Now I'm getting a chance 
to spend time with my own." 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo, who turns 50 in December, recently became a grandfather for the 
first time when his daughter, Deanna, gave birth to a girl. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my job right now, my little granddaughter, Meagan," he said. "My wife 
and I get more pleasure out of that than anything." 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean that Ferragamo is content to spend the rest of his coaching days 
toiling in the background? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really pretty happy right now," he said. "There's still a little 
competitive fire. Some day I might like to be a head coach again. Maybe some 
day. I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo's competitive fires burned brightly during his 18-year reign as 
Banning's coach. After enduring some lean years, Ferragamo guided the Pilots to 
eight L.A. City titles, including an unprecedented six in a row from 1976 to 
1981. His career record was 157-36-4. 
</P>
<P>
He was the toast of Wilmington, the blue-collar city where he grew up and 
helped put on the map through Banning's successes on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when Chris could have run for mayor of Wilmington," said 
Harbor College Athletic Director Jim O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo believed that coaching a nationally recognized high school team would 
lead to a job at a university or an established community college. But he never 
got beyond an audition. Stanford, USC and El Camino College were among the 
schools that turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, what they were saying was that I didn't have enough college 
coaching experience," he said. "So I took the Harbor College job." 
</P>
<P>
Others, though, said Ferragamo's downfall was an overbearing attitude that 
turned off administrators and coaches at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
"There was definitely an arrogant side to him," said one college coach. 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo admitted that he may have come on too strong in interviews. Twice he 
applied for the head job at El Camino College, but was passed over for Jack 
Reilly in 1982 and John Featherstone in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have got the El Camino job," he said. "But I think they figured I was 
too dominant a personality. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a takeover person. If I'm in a group, I have a tendency to be the guy that 
wants to direct and organize everything. It's just inside me; that's what makes 
me go." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the issue of his ability as a coach. Despite his success at 
Banning, some questioned if Ferragamo could cut it on the college level. That 
might have been answered during his two-year stint at Harbor College, where his 
teams compiled a dismal 3-17-1 record, including 1-10 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It has led some to believe that Ferragamo excelled at Banning because he had 
great talent -- players such as Freeman McNeil, Stanley Wilson and Jamelle 
Holieway -- and not because he was great with X's and O's. 
</P>
<P>
Others voice a more sympathetic opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's unfortunate what's happened in his coaching career, because 
nobody likes to see what he's gone through," said Featherstone, coach of the 
successful El Camino program. "The coaching fraternity is a tough fraternity. 
You've got to produce and you've got to win or, unfortunately, you are looked 
upon as a loser. Chris isn't a loser. He just got caught in a tough situation 
at Harbor for a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo can handle the criticism. In evaluating his abilities, he graded 
himself as a good motivator and average tactician. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing I have going for me is that I'm a motivator," he said. "I 
would take a kid who was unmotivated and try to get him jacked up to play ball. 
That was my forte. I wasn't a great coach, but I was good doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Ferragamo has no regrets, it is clear that his descent as a coach 
began when he took over the football program at Harbor College. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks have struggled for years to compete under the long shadow of 
neighboring El Camino College, which regularly attracts the best high school 
players in the South Bay because of its winning tradition, seasoned coaching 
staff and excellent facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo, though, believed that his reputation at Banning would help him draw 
top-notch players to Harbor. He was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I could draw the good kids, but it was just the opposite," he said. 
"I didn't get one Banning player that first year, not one. I guess the kids 
didn't like me. It was very disillusioning." 
</P>
<P>
Banning Coach Joe Dominguez, who served under Ferragamo for 12 seasons as the 
offensive coordinator at Banning and one year at Harbor, offered another 
viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"When a kid leaves high school, he has aspirations of playing further at the 
Division I level," Dominguez said. "Those two years at a junior college are 
very important to him. He doesn't want to experiment. He wants to go to a known 
program where he's going to get exposure." 
</P>
<P>
There were other problems. Before the 1987 season, Ferragamo unknowingly 
violated a recruiting rule by sending letters to high school coaches outside of 
Harbor's district. The state placed him on probation for a year, during which 
time Harbor's recruiting was monitored. 
</P>
<P>
"It was embarrassing to our administrators," said O'Brien, the Harbor athletic 
director. "They didn't like it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor was 2-7-1 in Ferragamo's first year. It was his worst season as a coach 
since Banning was 1-7 in 1972, the year after quarterback Vince Ferragamo, 
Chris' youngest brother, graduated before going on to play for Nebraska and the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
But if Ferragamo's first year at Harbor was rough, 1988 was a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the season began with a coaching faux pas. Before Harbor played El 
Camino, Ferragamo sent an assistant coach, John Brown, to watch the Warriors 
run through an inter-squad scrimmage, a violation of scouting practices. 
</P>
<P>
When Featherstone spotted Brown taking notes in the stands at El Camino's 
Murdock Stadium, he confronted Brown, took the notebook out of his hands and 
told him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an isolated incident," Featherstone said. "I don't think Chris was 
familiar with the rules, and I don't think John Brown understood, either. They 
both apologized." 
</P>
<P>
But the incident resulted in bad publicity for Ferragamo and Harbor. And the 
publicity grew worse. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks were not merely losing, they were losing ugly. In a 47-10 defeat 
at Bakersfield College, four Harbor players were ejected for fighting and 
assistant coach Jim True, Ferragamo's right-hand man, was suspended for shoving 
a trainer over a disagreement on how to treat an injured player. 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo does not deny that the team had discipline problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was that I couldn't get the kids that were disciplined to come 
there," he said. "I got kids that were undisciplined. That's the only thing I 
could get. I had to play with whatever I had. If I kicked off all the kids on 
my team that were undisciplined, I wouldn't have had anybody left." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Ferragamo realizes the situation grew worse because he was an 
off-campus coach. A science teacher at Banning for 28 years, he was not at 
Harbor during the day to address the needs of his players. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dominguez: "If you don't get there until an hour before practice, you 
can't solve those problems." 
</P>
<P>
The failure of Harbor's program to take off under Ferragamo came as a great 
surprise and disappointment to O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
"With his attitude and charisma, I thought he would have the kids storming in," 
he said. "We had a good turnout of kids the first year, but the key was that so 
many left. It seemed like we were starting over every year." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, coach of Harbor's state champion baseball team, said Ferragamo might 
have underestimated the competitiveness of community college athletics. Or, as 
one coach put it, Ferragamo suffered from "visions of grandeur." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, though, admired Ferragamo's work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a guy who worked any harder than he did," he said. "I have 
great respect for Chris. He has a lot of energy. If he were a salesman, he 
would make a million dollars. He has that gleam in his eye." 
</P>
<P>
But the gleam turned to a glaze after two years at Harbor. After the 1988 
season, Ferragamo withdrew his name from a list of candidates who had applied 
for a temporary full-time position in the athletic department, a job earmarked 
by O'Brien for the football coach. With the job guaranteed for only a year, 
Ferragamo felt he could not afford to leave his teaching position at Banning. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks later, Don Weems, a former assistant coach at Santa Monica 
College and Nevada-Las Vegas, was hired as coach. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's loss became Long Beach City College's gain. 
</P>
<P>
Without a coaching job for the first time since 1963, Ferragamo got a call in 
the summer of 1989 from Long Beach City College Coach Wil Shaw, asking him to 
join the Viking staff as the offensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't put any pressure on me," said Ferragamo, a former All-Marine League 
center at Banning. "Had he done that, I wouldn't be there. I found a home over 
there, a little niche." 
</P>
<P>
In his first year at Long Beach, the Vikings were 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
Some believed Ferragamo would return to Banning after leaving Harbor. But he 
has no immediate plans to return to the high school game. 
</P>
<P>
"I never regret leaving Banning," he said. "I enjoyed all my years of coaching 
there, with Dominguez and (defensive coordinator) Rocky Garibay and those guys, 
because they were great. Those are memories I cherish a lot. But the reason I 
left is because I wanted new horizons in coaching. I've been to Harbor and now 
I'm at Long Beach City. I've seen what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez said he never asked Ferragamo to join his staff at Banning. 
</P>
<P>
"I have so much respect for Chris, I feel it would have been a put-down for me 
to offer him a job," he said. "I couldn't have done that." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, however, had no qualms about asking Ferragamo to help out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping he would be receptive, and he was," said Shaw, entering his 
seventh season as coach at Long Beach. "It has worked out well. He's a loyal, 
hard-working coach. He's been very successful, and he brings that with him." 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo will have the added pleasure this season of coaching his nephew, Greg 
Sorensen, a 6-foot-3, 260-pound freshman center from Los Alamitos High. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be an All-American," said his proud uncle. 
</P>
<P>
Sorensen is the third relative Ferragamo has coached. His brother, Vince, and 
his eldest son, Chris Jr. (Class of 1980), were quarterbacks at Banning.

The following are some capsule reviews of the better restaurants recently 
visited by our critics: 
</P>
<P>
Heard of Mariscos Miguel? Not many people have, and it's a shame. Owner Miguel 
Gonzales serves some wonderful Mexican dishes, particularly the seafood, in 
this former coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the appetizers can make great light lunches. The tostadas de ceviche 
consist of pieces of fish marinated in citrus juice, with chunks of tomato, 
cilantro and cabbage. And for one quesadilla dish, shrimp are sauteed in onions 
and herbs and tucked into corn tortillas and fried. 
</P>
<P>
As for entrees, there are the traditional tamales, chiles rellenos and 
enchiladas, but it's the seafood dishes that stand out. Pescado alla Gonzales 
is fresh halibut sauteed with tiny shrimp and served in a lemony salsa de una 
butter. The mahi-mahi is served crisp on one side, tender on the other, with a 
cilantro-butter sauce, homemade tomato salsa and a delicious fruit salsa. 
</P>
<P>
For breakfast, there is a choice of American dishes -- pancakes, French toast, 
omelets -- or Mexican dishes. The chile verde omelet is filled with cheese and 
covered with a green chili sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Mariscos Miguel is at 1812 Cliff Drive, Unit C, Santa Barbara, 687-7783. 
Breakfast and lunch are served 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday to Saturday; 8 a.m. to 2 
p.m. Sunday. Dinner is served 5 to 9 p.m. Wednesday to Monday. Dinner for two, 
food only, will cost $11 to $32. 
</P>
<P>
Start with a house salad. That's the easiest way to initiate the palate into 
the Turkish and Mediterranean dishes served by Abraham Aymelek, the owner-chef 
of Moonangel. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, why not start with several house salads? A sampler features tastes of 
five selections, highlighted by the patlican salatasi -- an eggplant dish that 
is mousselike in texture -- and the sweet and tart grape leaves stuffed with 
rice. The borek, or spinach pie, is pretty tempting too. 
</P>
<P>
Following that introduction, move on to the main course. One of the traditional 
Turkish menu items is mantarli kuzu, a lamb and mushroom stew. The list of 
Mediterranean dishes is topped by the poached seafood wrapped in paper and 
steamed in a wine-based, seasoned broth. 
</P>
<P>
Moonangel is located at 302 W. Montecito St., Santa Barbara, 962-8949. Lunch is 
served 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday, dinner 5:30 to 11 p.m. 
daily and brunch 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Sunday. Buffet lunch for two, food 
only will cost $15. Dinner for two, food only will cost $32 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
Neon beer signs and colored lights make Golden China restaurant look like a 
pizza parlor. But that's where the similarity ends. The two large dining rooms 
with carved wood panels, Oriental chairs and lantern light fixtures are a dead 
giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
So are the 113 Mandarin and Sichuan items on the menu, most of which are rich 
with garlic and ginger, and some very sweet. 
</P>
<P>
The mixed appetizers are served on a wooden platter with a fire pot burning in 
the middle. The resulting glow over the table is nice, as is the teriyaki beef 
on a stick. 
</P>
<P>
Golden China is located at 1105 S. Seaward Ave., Ventura, 652-0688. Lunch and 
dinner are served 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Dinner for two, food only, $20 
to $44. 
</P>
<P>
From the way the suns shines through the dining room, to the classical Mexican 
and Yucatan cuisine, Cafe Vallarta is a treat for the senses. The new menu 
includes such entrees as a calamari-stuffed chile relleno, a mild pollo 
almendrado and an award-winning caldo de mariscos (or bouillabaisse). The beer 
snacks, especially the cochinita pibil (pork cooked in banana leaves), are 
worth trying. Cafe Vallarta is located at 620 E. Haley St., Santa Barbara, 
564-8494. Dinner is served from 5 to 9:30 p.m. Tuesdays through Thursdays, and 
5 to 10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant is closed Sundays and 
Mondays. Dinner for two, food only, $28 to $40.

NIGHT LIFE: THE CLUB SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
A MIGHTY PENN; 
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL PENN PROVES HIS REFRESHING COMBINATION OF STYLE AND SUBSTANCE IS 'NO 
MYTH.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Along with Lenny Kravitz, Michael Penn (no relation to Sir William Penn but 
definitely a brother of Sean) produced one of the most ingratiating and 
innovative debut discs of 1989 with his "March." A singer/songwriter/guitarist, 
Penn is a heartbeat away from nirvana in alchemy, a gold record. He'll be 
playing selections from the album, plus a few new ones plus some covers when he 
plays the Ventura Theatre Sunday. Missing "The Simpsons," "Married With 
Children" and "In Living Color" is indeed serious business, but that's why Mom 
bought you that VCR. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura gig will be the next to last for the performer, who has been on the 
road since February. "I'm going to take a couple of months off, do some 
writing, maybe go to the beach. Then, in a couple of months my keyboard player, 
Patrick Warren, and myself will do an acoustic tour. Right now, there's five 
members in the band. We've been all over on the tour -- Texas, New York, New 
England, Colorado, Seattle, all over. In fact, our very first gig on this tour 
was in Santa Barbara at The Carnaval Club back in February." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most people who put off the inevitable "So what do you want to be?" 
question indefinitely, Penn knew he wanted to be a musician when he was young. 
"I just got into music very heavily as a kid and I pretty much knew I wanted to 
be a musician. I liked The Band, Van Morrison, Neil Young, Costello, The Clash, 
Tom Waits and thousands of others." 
</P>
<P>
Penn was in a lot of different bands in junior high and high school -- he went 
to Santa Monica High School. His first professional band was The Doll Congress. 
"We made an attempt to not sound like any other band in L.A., and I think we 
succeeded at that. We put out on independent label EP, but the band broke up in 
1987." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe J. Geils was right -- maybe love does stink. One thing's certain, though, 
bad love can make for good songs. In rock 'n' roll, there's been a million of 
them. And Penn, as a writer, is considerably more clever than most when it 
comes to lamenting love lousy. From "Brave New World," a sample line: 
</P>
<P>
 "Baby's busy hiding in the bassinet 
</P>
<P>
 wonderin' if the third world war started yet. 
</P>
<P>
 I told her I was pulling up and heading west 
</P>
<P>
 she said she would have come but she was overdressed. 
</P>
<P>
 So I sent her a postcard of a Midwest bank. 
</P>
<P>
 She wrote me she showed it to her new friend Frank ..." 
</P>
<P>
 Other songs deal with saying goodby, saying hello, saying nothing, saying too 
much and being "Invisible" to the waitress of your dreams. Maybe Penn does need 
some time on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"People should come to see us because we'll be giving away free money."

DETECTIVES: AS NEW PRIVACY LAWS RESTRICT ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION, 
TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME MORE IMPORTANT.

<P>
Dan Jones doesn't mind that his life as a private detective isn't anything like 
that of his Hollywood-invented counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
What he does mind is that most people don't know it. 
</P>
<P>
"The public's perception of investigators is that they peek through bedroom 
windows and get information by all kinds of questionable methods. But it's a 
total fallacy," said Jones, a detective with offices in Ventura and Glendale. 
"A stereotypical investigator like that just doesn't exist to any extent 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for this is that many detectives now have a wide range of high-tech 
equipment at their disposal -- cameras, recording equipment and computer banks 
-- that enable them to find out, within minutes, information such as what 
property you own, what your driving record is, if you have a history of filing 
lawsuits, whether you are married or divorced, and whether you have a criminal 
background. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another reason that old-fashioned snoop methods have become a 
thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
At the annual meeting of the California Assn. of Licensed Investigators (CALI), 
a nonprofit trade association that gathered recently in Ventura, Jones and 
nearly 200 detectives from throughout the state came to discuss the numerous 
changes that have complicated their profession. 
</P>
<P>
Top among those changes, investigators said, and a topic woven into nearly 
every conversation at the CALI meeting, are the new privacy laws. These, 
investigators say, have made it more difficult to obtain certain types of 
information -- including where you live and what your credit history is -- than 
ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, there is a trend toward anti-access of information. We're looking 
at that as an eventual cost disaster for consumers," said Robert Frasco, 
president of CALI and a Burbank private investigator. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest and most recent changes to affect investigators occurred 
last year, following the July slaying of actress Rebecca Schaeffer in the 
doorway of her Los Angeles apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer's assailant reportedly had obtained her home address through 
Department of Motor Vehicle public records. In August, amid public outcry for 
tighter controls on the dissemination of such information, Gov. George 
Deukmejian signed into law a bill that restricts the release of home addresses 
by the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
Frasco said the law has had a crippling effect. 
</P>
<P>
"What they didn't talk about before they made this law," said Frasco, "was 
that, in the three to five years preceding this event, there were more than 16 
million legitimate uses of DMV address information. One crackpot misuses the 
information, and now all the businesses who need it for legitimate reasons are 
denied access." 
</P>
<P>
The governor acknowledged last year that the vast majority of address requests 
were for legitimate, lawful purposes, but added that public safety was at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators who must ferret out fraudulent claims on behalf of the insurance 
industry, Frasco said, have been particularly hard hit by the new law. 
</P>
<P>
"You essentially have taken away the ability of the investigator to fight these 
claims," Frasco said. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Smart, a former senior investigator with the Ventura County district 
attorney's office who now is a private investigator in Oxnard, said the DMV law 
has had an impact on cases he handles. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people out there were adopted and are looking for their birth 
parents. The DMV used to be a great source of information for that," Smart 
said, adding that he relies heavily on computer data banks for much of his 
investigative work. 
</P>
<P>
"I've also had clients who were trying to locate an old friend, or cases where 
people have won judgments against people and are trying to collect on the 
judgment," he said. "But they can't find the person now. We don't have the 
access." 
</P>
<P>
Private eyes don't get all of their information from computer banks and public 
records. Tried and true methods -- such as stakeouts to uncover such things as 
corporate thefts and fraudulent workers' compensation claims -- still do quite 
nicely in some cases. But even so, investigators report, all that new 
technology is affected by new privacy laws that change the way detectives work. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some TV portrayals, a private eye's surveillances are not always 
conducted from the stereotypical, old Rambler with half-eaten sandwiches and 
empty coffee cups on the front seat. Many of today's P.I.'s have 
state-of-the-art $80,000 vans, complete with infrared cameras and periscopes 
for hard to photograph subjects. The technology, detectives report, has 
increased the number of some convictions, because more positive identifications 
are made. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, information doesn't mean anything if you don't also have 
evidence. So there's a lot of new technology that's had a dramatic impact on 
the industry," said Gary Williams, a former Bay Area undercover narcotics cop 
who has worked as a Silicon Valley private detective since 1976 and who co-led 
a well-attended seminar at the CALI meeting called, "Conducting a Moving 
Surveillance." 
</P>
<P>
At that seminar, Williams, Los Angeles private investigator Ed McLain and Santa 
Barbara private investigator Jim Rochester discussed new privacy laws 
pertaining to surveillances, including a federal bill that now limits the 
electronic monitoring of employees by employers. 
</P>
<P>
One private detective in his late 20s raised his hand and inquired about the 
legality of photographing subjects away from public places, such as in their 
homes or back yards. 
</P>
<P>
The question elicited murmurs from the group. "Even if you're photographing 
from a public street, it's borderline," McLain said. "Twenty years ago, people 
accepted that type of conduct if the person was guilty. But not anymore," he 
said. "Today, the idea of photographing into people's homes has become 
extremely objectionable. You could get sued." 
</P>
<P>
Rochester interjected another piece of information pertaining to a messier form 
of surveillance. "Don't go into people's garbage in Ventura County, either," he 
said, as several detectives in the audience began writing earnestly in their 
notebooks. "The police can do it, but investigators here have no right to. They 
can be prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
But not all difficulty in getting information these days is the result of legal 
hindrances. Even when detectives knock on doors in a more straightforward 
approach to find out what people know or what they have seen they encounter 
obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors aren't as talkative as they used to be. Employers are tight-lipped. 
Phone inquiries regarding the smallest details are met with, "Sorry, we can't 
give you that kind of information." 
</P>
<P>
But not all difficulty in getting information these days is the result of legal 
hindrances. Individuals are increasingly unwilling, said investigators, to 
divulge personal information -- an attitude confirmed by a recent Louis Harris 
and Associates poll, which found that Americans today are more concerned about 
their privacy than at any other time in the last 20 years. And, they added, it 
is getting more and more difficult to obtain information from businesses, 
which, many detectives believe, are more fearful of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a general attitude now that if you are asking for 
information, you are doing something you shouldn't," said McLain, who has been 
a Los Angeles investigator for the last 34 years. "I guess a lot of people are 
also concerned about the liability of the information giver. Most employers, 
for instance, will only confirm the date of hire and date of discharge." 
</P>
<P>
Frasco shares that belief. "Aunt Tilly calls from Nebraska and says her niece 
has been in California for a while but has stopped writing. She wants to know 
if she is OK," he said, giving a hypothetical case for an investigator. "The 
police can't help because there has been no crime. The neighbors won't talk, 
because you might be stalking the girl. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the America we knew before," he said. "People used to assume there 
was a legitimate reason for an inquiry. Now they assume there is a criminal 
intent." 
</P>
<P>
But difficulty in obtaining information may have caused a boost in business. 
Individuals and businesses that never before would have considered hiring a 
detective are now finding that they can't get information on their own. 
</P>
<P>
There is an upside to the issue. In many ways, the same thing that detectives 
consider to be their greatest problem -- that is, difficulty in obtaining 
certain kinds of information -- also may have caused a boost for business. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to get background information on prospective employees, for instance, 
many employers now turn to detectives for help. Ditto for the businessman who 
plans to go into partnership with an individual, but first wants more 
information about the person. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the private detective industry has grown. In the last 10 years, 
the number of investigators in California has nearly tripled, up from 2,484 in 
1979 to 6,046 in 1989, according to the Bureau of Collection and Investigative 
Services, the Sacramento-based agency responsible for the licensing of private 
investigators. In Ventura County, the rate was much the same, increasing from 
71 investigators in 1979, to 192 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Agency officials acknowledged that, among them all, there are bound to be a few 
who will ignore privacy laws and go outside ethical boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"They can change the laws all they want, and all they do is create a larger 
black market for information," said Tom Eubanks a private investigator in 
Camarillo. "There are a lot of people who will give you information if you pay 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Former Ventura district attorney investigator Smart expressed scorn for such 
practices. "Sure, there are ways to get information if you are illegal, 
immoral, unethical or have enough money to buy it. But I don't know any 
investigators who are unethical and who would go out and do things against the 
law to accomplish an objective." 
</P>
<P>
But what would happen if they did? According to a spokeswoman for the Bureau of 
Collection and Investigative Services said, they would be headed for trouble. 
If suspected of wrongdoing, an investigator's name would be turned over to the 
Bureau of Consumer Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
And what happens then? 
</P>
<P>
Simple. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be investigated by an investigator."

A SPRINKLING OF LADYBUGS AND MANTISES CAN KEEP THE REALLY NASTY INSECTS AWAY 
FROM YOUR COOKOUTS.

<P>
Wander into your back yard during the summer months and you can almost hear the 
jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbecue!" roar the ants. "Fruits and vegetables!' add the aphids and white 
ash flies. "People!" say the mosquitoes and wasps, invariably followed by the 
not-so-happy retort from your family, "Let's go inside." 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, the solution was simple: Purchase every type of bug death on the 
market, don the gas mask and attack, spraying everything that moves back there. 
And, oh yes, "Dear, I've just sprayed, so keep the kids away until about 
December, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
No, it's not OK. Summer is a great time for family get-togethers, and there are 
safe, non-destructo ways to keep bugs at arms length without having to take out 
the radiation detector every time your family enters the back-yard nuclear hot 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many natural things you can use to get rid of the unwanted bugs," 
says Lucy Burkard, the manager of Green Meadow Nursery in Camarillo and a 
fourth-generation greens person. "There are even a few things the kids can 
watch and learn about nature." 
</P>
<P>
Tops on her list? Ladybugs and praying mantises. 
</P>
<P>
Available in many nurseries, especially in early spring and early summer (it 
gets too hot to ship them past early summer, although Burkard says they can be 
special-ordered during other months), bugs like this are considered "beneficial 
insects," and attack other bugs. Sort of a good bug with the white hat and bad 
bug with the black hat analogy. 
</P>
<P>
Burkard recommends releasing ladybugs ln the evening, after watering, "because 
they don't fly at night and will look for prey in the immediate area." OK, but 
even at about five dollars for several hundred ladybugs, what's to stop them 
from leaving my yard for others in the neighborhood? "As long as you have 
enough bad bugs in the area," she says, "the ladybugs will be content to stay 
where they are." 
</P>
<P>
As will the praying mantises. 
</P>
<P>
They usually come two egg cases to a container (again, for about five dollars). 
Within a few days you'll have about 400 babies breaking out and looking for 
food. 
</P>
<P>
"What's fun is to put a thread through the egg case and hang it from a nearby 
tree in the infested area," Burkard says. "Then the kids can come out every day 
and watch the eggs until they hatch.' 
</P>
<P>
OK, sounds great, but what do I do with a back yard full of praying mantises 
and ladybugs (which the mantises won't eat, by the way)? Nothing. When the bad 
bugs are gone, the beneficial bugs will move elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Another product Burkard recommends is Safer Soap, manufactured by Safer Inc. 
(189 Wells Ave., Newton, Mass. 02159. 617/964-2990). 
</P>
<P>
According to Mark Dockser of Safer, the company markets more than 50 products 
refined to have a maximum effect on bad bugs while not harming the beneficial 
ones such as honey bees and ladybugs. 
</P>
<P>
The various soaps, he says, are different from their petrochemical counterparts 
in that they are considerably less toxic and break down into harmless 
substances in about 48 hours, which means no potential to contaminate ground 
water. 
</P>
<P>
And the products are selective in the insects they kill. For example, some 
soaps go after moths, algae and weeds, yet leave delicate plants such as 
African violets undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, certain ground rules. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to hit the bug to make the product work," Dockser says, "but if you 
spray both sides of the leaves you have a good chance of nailing everything 
that's around." Unless the infestation is heavy, he says the average back yard 
can go up to two weeks between sprays. 
</P>
<P>
"And," Burkard adds, "some studies indicate that some Safer soaps have affected 
the white ash fly larvae." 
</P>
<P>
Get rid of the white ash fly? Those pesky little things that look like 
thousands of pieces of large dandruff falling from the sky? The answer, she 
says, is yes. 
</P>
<P>
Burkard says the soap (there also are other brands but she says Safer is the 
biggest) comes in ready-to-use packages or in concentrated form to be diluted 
with a hose sprayer. One package should easily do a couple hundred square feet 
of shrubs with no problem and you should start noticing a difference in a 
couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
One caveat, however. Wear protective clothing, perhaps even consider a face 
mask. Nothing in the soap would harm you, but why ingest anything into your 
body you don't have to? 
</P>
<P>
* IN VENTURA COUNTY: Ladybugs and praying mantises are available at most large 
nurseries. Safer Soap can be purchased at most lawn and garden centers, 
nurseries and home shopping centers such as the Home Depot and Builder's 
Emporium.

MUSIC: LEO DOWNEY; 
</P>
<P>
HE'S EVERYWHERE; 
</P>
<P>
THE MAN IS ALIVE AND WANTED. AND HE'S PROBABLY PERFORMING SOMEWHERE TONIGHT.

A person could see Leo Downey's face on walls all over town at least as often 
as Bonnie and Clyde when they were popular. But it's not the cops that want 
Downey, it's Santa Barbara music lovers. The guy's got fans. 
</P>
<P>
Downey is the musical equivalent of weather in the Midwest -- if you don't like 
it now, wait a minute. Downey, 30, has been a musician for half of his life, 
and a performer since he was 19. He's as hard to pin down as Houdini's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, he's an accomplished classical guitarist. He also fronts a 
regular rock band, The Leo Downey Band, which has anywhere from three to a 
million members. They rock hard. They rock soft. They rock in between. They do 
mostly originals; they can do covers. 
</P>
<P>
Downey was born in Singapore, but has lived in Santa Barbara for 15 years, 
graduating from Santa Barbara High School. On just about every side of every 
kiosk in Santa Barbara there is Downey's face staring at you from a poster 
advertising his next gig, which is seemingly every night. He is as ubiquitous 
as a skilled politician. He's everywhere. And he's only one guy. 
</P>
<P>
"No, we really don't play that much," said Downey in a recent interview. He 
plays The Ketch on Thursdays and The Grill in Montecito on Tuesdays with a 
three-man band. And he's doing a solo show at The Green Dragon on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole band has only played together about 10 times. The membership sort of 
fluctuates. The band has only been around for about 2 1/2 years -- we played on 
St. Patrick's Day for our first gig. The last original member, Jack Folks died 
last month -- he was only 37. He got leukemia, and within two months, he was 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
When Downey does his regular Tuesday and Thursday gigs, it's with two other 
musicians, guitarist Jason Frost and harmonica player Tom Crockett. He begins 
with a set of classical acoustic guitar songs before the other members show up 
around 10:30. "I need both types of music -- classical and rock. I don't know a 
damn thing about music -- I'm entirely self-taught. I suppose I'd like to make 
it as a rocker because I always have the classical stuff as well." 
</P>
<P>
He's doing OK as a hyphenate. A classical CD Downey made a few years ago has 
recently been added to the play list of a Los Angeles easy-listening station. A 
full-on rock CD, "Heaven and Hell," featuring the band has sold more than 400 
copies the first month. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully I can land some sort of distribution deal for the new one," Downey 
said. "We've done a few showcase gigs in L.A. and some industry people from 
three different labels have expressed interest. I just want to be able to make 
more music and play all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
While Downey is easy to find around the Santa Barbara night club scene, other 
times he can be as invisible as friends on moving day. From time to time, 
Downey disappears for a wildlife sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually I go over the hill," said Downey pointing, "into the San Rafael 
Wilderness. Sometimes I need to just get away and be happy. The music business 
can be pretty high pressure, so I just go out into the woods to relax and write 
a little bit. In fact I just came back -- I was gone for four days." 
</P>
<P>
Downey doesn't have a day job -- music is his business, although he had some 
part-time work a few weeks back -- helping to fight the recent Santa Barbara 
fire. He helped save Joe Cocker's house. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, he'll be found at The Ketch on Thursday, surrounded by adoring 
fans. It's a mellow Santa-Barbara-chic, State Street hangout (with patios and 
everything) and it's free.

GOINGS ON: SANTA BARBARA;

<P>
WEST MEETS EAST; 
</P>
<P>
A CHAMPION OF COMMUNITY THEATER HAS A NEW CHALLENGE AS THE RECITER IN CITY 
COLLEGE MUSICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEO SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Champion has been performing in community theater musicals for the last 
17 years. He has about 45 of them under his belt. Yet the Los Angeles actor 
said he has never had a role quite like the one he has with the Santa Barbara 
City College Theatre Group beginning tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Champion will play the part of The Reciter, the lead role in the company's 
version of the 1976 Stephen Sondheim hit "Pacific Overtures." As The Reciter, 
Champion narrates the entire production. 
</P>
<P>
"Pacific Overtures" is based on the real-life story of Commodore Matthew 
Perry's expedition to Japan in 1853, which ended 250 years of Japanese 
isolation, and it is told from the Japanese point of view. As West meets East 
in the story, so it does in the production of the show, combining American 
musical theater and Japanese theater styles, including Kabuki, with actors 
costumed in white makeup and black wigs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's how the Japanese felt about the Westerners being there," Champion said. 
"The Japanese viewed us as barbarians coming to their land to eat them up. 
They'd never seen Americans or battleships. They thought we were going to 
strike them blind." 
</P>
<P>
Though Champion has always been interested in Kabuki, he'd never had any 
exposure to it before the rehearsals. "I'm still learning it," he said. "Kabuki 
is very stylized, very presentational, straight to the audience. In most 
theater, there is a wall between the actor and the audience. This play goes 
past that wall." 
</P>
<P>
Champion's role, in particular, is directed at the crowd. The Reciter's 
presence on stage throughout the entire two-hour-plus production is similar to 
Kabuki, in which the performers never leave the stage. 
</P>
<P>
"Every page -- or within a page or two -- he says something," Champion said. 
"It's almost all monologue. I have to memorize huge blocks rather than in 
dialogue, where there is constantly a back-and-forth. There is no one to really 
work off of; it's just me and the audience." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese influences can also be seen in the scenery and music. The sets are 
similar to the Kabuki style with flat, parallel screens that are a far cry from 
the three-dimensional sets common in American musicals. A five-piece orchestra 
uses a synthesizer to make sounds typical of Japanese music. 
</P>
<P>
"These elements of Kabuki are implied, not full out," Champion said, because 
the audience is not used to Japanese theater. 
</P>
<P>
This will be Champion's first performance with the City College company. He is 
performing at the invitation of director Adrianne Harrop, with whom he has 
worked before. The rest of the company consists of community actors and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN: "Pacific Overtures" will run through Aug. 4 at Garvin Theater, 
located on the college's west campus (on the 800 block of Cliff Drive). Show 
times are Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m. General 
admission tickets are $10 and $12. There is a preview tonight at 8 p.m., with 
tickets $7. Call the box office at 965-5935.

On an immense, dusty pasture about seven miles north of Merced, community 
activist Bob Carpenter envisions classrooms, dormitories, a library and a gym. 
</P>
<P>
For some walnut groves and cotton fields just outside Visalia, city official 
Michael Ramsey imagines world-famous laboratories and computer centers. 
</P>
<P>
Along the gently sloping foothills between Fresno and the snow-capped Sierra, a 
university of great scholars could rise, local banker Leo Lutz predicts. 
</P>
<P>
Big dreams all, and doable with enough money and foresight, contend those 
dreamers and others throughout eight San Joaquin Valley counties. But the rub 
is that only one such vision can come true. 
</P>
<P>
The farm-based communities are pitted against each other in a lively 
competition to be the next host city for a University of California campus and 
all the jobs, big bucks and prestige UC brings. Governments and volunteer 
groups are engaged in rival campaigns of boosterism and are dangling amazingly 
large plots of free or cheap land before the UC Regents, who are to announce 
Friday a list of eight to 10 semifinalists from about 70 possible land tracts. 
</P>
<P>
San Joaquin Valley interest in the school is so strong that Mark Aydelotte, 
UC's area representative in Fresno, said he was tailed after a recent community 
meeting by other drivers apparently hoping his route home would provide clues 
to the site decision. 
</P>
<P>
"People have only one question for me: 'Where is the new campus going to go?' " 
said Aydelotte, who insists he does not know. 
</P>
<P>
That a city would want a UC campus is not surprising. Such a campus can pump 
millions of dollars into the local economy, spin off high-tech industries from 
laboratory research and give residents better access to higher education. It 
also can put a town on the nation's intellectual map. After all, how many Ivy 
League scholars ever heard of Santa Cruz or Irvine before the initials "UC" 
appeared in front of those names? 
</P>
<P>
"There is a competition, but there hasn't been any kind of nastiness or 
negativeness associated with it," former Fresno Mayor Dan Whitehurst said. "But 
things might change when we get down to 10 specific sites." 
</P>
<P>
In advance of Friday's announcement, UC officials would only say the search is 
focused on eight counties: Tulare, Fresno, Madera, Merced, Mariposa, 
Stanislaus, San Joaquin and Tuolumne. The list of eight to 10 semifinalist 
sites, detailed down to crossroads and acreage, will be reduced to three 
finalists in November. A winner is to be chosen a year later after 
environmental impact studies are reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, a dozen committees from places such as Los Banos, 
Modesto, Madera, Manteca and Hanford have besieged UC officials with reports, 
brochures, videotapes, T-shirts and telephone calls touting locations. 
Aydelotte sometimes is concerned that the reality of a campus can never match 
expectations that a UC "will mean a new renaissance, a new day, a solution to 
all sorts of problems." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there is opposition from farmers worried about pollution and the 
loss of agricultural land. UC says it wants between 1,500 and 2,000 acres away 
from the better soils of California's food-producing heartland. 
</P>
<P>
Others are concerned about the social and political effects an army of students 
could have on quiet, conservative farming communities. At a meeting in Sonora, 
an elderly gentleman angrily asked whether the main education at a UC is in 
"drugs and kinky sex," Aydelotte laughingly recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Still, most people in the region were delighted when the regents decided in 
February that the first of three new campuses to accommodate a projected 
enrollment boom should be built in the San Joaquin Valley by 1998. The two 
others might follow in the northern and southern parts of the state. The last 
major UC expansion was in the mid-1960s with the openings of the San Diego, 
Santa Cruz and Irvine campuses, and the valley has felt snubbed since. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because none of the nine UC campuses are in the valley, high school 
graduates from the area attend UC at a rate half the statewide average. And the 
population of the valley, from Calaveras County south to Kern County, is 2.6 
million and is expected to grow faster than that of any region in the state 
over the next 10 years, fueled by refugees from high housing prices elsewhere 
in California and from economic and political troubles in Asia, Latin America 
and Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
The valley is still dominated by agribusiness and family orchards. But the 
two-story homes and shopping malls blossoming on what were cotton fields a year 
ago suggest that the bucolic isolation is eroding. Long commutes to jobs in the 
San Francisco Bay Area are becoming more common, and white-collar employment in 
the valley itself is increasing faster than jobs in farming. Some people talk 
fearfully of "Los Angelization." Others say changes are inevitable and a UC 
campus with high-tech research as well as agricultural science courses would 
provide the education to cope with such change. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure we need the school," farmer Fred Giorgetti said at his produce stand in 
Centerville, about 20 miles east of Fresno and next to one of the possible 
sites in the foothills. Twelve ears of corn were selling for $1.50, and French 
tourists en route to Sequoia National Park were buying up nectarines and 
walnuts in apparent delight at the low prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Berlin is going to be the capital of Europe, Tokyo is going to be the capital 
of Asia, and if we don't get some educated people, we are going to be the 
capital of dope dealers," Giorgetti continued, saying he would be willing to 
sell the farm that has been in his family for 85 years. 
</P>
<P>
The cultural life and prestige of any town that became a UC town presumably 
would increase. "Whether it's condoms for cows or tiny robot bugs to eat grape 
leaf skeletonizers . . ., surely some absent-minded professor will stumble onto 
a world-class discovery and get us all on 'Good Morning America,' " Fresno Bee 
newspaper columnist Jim Wasserman joked. 
</P>
<P>
The new UC would start with 1,000 students and possibly grow over 25 years to 
as many as 25,000. That would require a faculty of about 1,400 and a 
non-teaching staff of about 9,000. In a region where unemployment runs as high 
as 15%, it would also mean thousands of new jobs serving hamburgers, selling 
houses and renting movies to UC students, workers and families. Student 
spending alone would eventually inject an estimated $5 million a year into the 
local economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The community needs it as an economic engine," explained Carpenter, the 
insurance agent who heads the UC Merced Campus Committee. Merced, in the 
northern part of the region, has 55,000 people, a lot of dairy farms and 
increasing amounts of light manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is little doubt that the value of land near a campus would 
increase sharply. (That became a sore point after reports that relatives of UC 
Regent Leo Kolligian had purchased land near a possible campus site in Merced. 
Kolligian denied that the purchase had anything to do with the campus study, 
but the university subsequently asked 200 of its officials to reveal any land 
holdings in region.) 
</P>
<P>
The Merced group is pushing range land next to Lake Yosemite, an artificial 
lake popular with boaters. The land, with fine views of the Sierra Nevada, is 
part of 7,000 acres donated to the local board of education. Merced officials 
think their plan -- to give 2,000 acres to UC and sell off the rest to 
developers -- is so sure-fire that they already have scheduled a community 
picnic Sunday to celebrate being named one of the semifinalists. 
</P>
<P>
Other places are offering free land, too. But since the prices range from 
$2,000 to $12,000 an acre, land would be a relatively small cost compared to 
the estimated $300 million needed to build the campus. 
</P>
<P>
So communities are trying to show how much they match other UC requirements: 
not more than 30 miles from a population center of 50,000; proximity to an 
airport and major highways; solid infrastructure; job possibilities for spouses 
of faculty; cultural and recreational opportunities; plentiful and inexpensive 
housing; visual beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Backers contend that 29 possible sites in Fresno County fit the bill. Fresno 
County (population 625,000) is presenting a united front in claiming to be the 
capital of the region. Where else are there so many hospitals, courthouses, 
museums, shopping centers, television stations, airplane routes, different 
ethnic groups and varied places of worship? 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that any community that gets the campus would benefit from a 
selfish viewpoint, but by choosing a Fresno (County) site, UC can fulfill its 
own mission a lot easier," said banker Lutz, a Fresno leader in UC wooing. 
</P>
<P>
Rivals carp that Fresno already has a California State University campus. But 
supporters point out that UC offers doctorates and stresses research, while the 
Cal State system offers only bachelor's and master's degrees and stresses 
undergraduate education. UC also let it be known that any new campus will not 
have much of an athletic program compared to the rabidly popular sports teams 
at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
Other possible sites include parts of the nearly 10,100-acre Mapes Ranch west 
of Modesto; a large tract on the eastern edge of Lake Madera; another near Los 
Banos between San Luis Dam and California 140; and three perfectly flat tracts 
of cotton fields very close to California 99 within a few miles of Visalia, a 
city of 77,000 between Bakersfield and Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign for a UC Visalia pitches a self-proclaimed pleasant lifestyle, 
beautiful trees, homes for under $100,000 and an old-fashioned downtown that 
could accommodate student cafes and bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important, local officials say, is meeting the UC demand that there be 
no significant public opposition. UC does not want a valley duplication of 
town-gown friction in Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara over housing, traffic, water 
and politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Our expectation is that they will be selecting us not just because Visalia is 
a good area. But they'll be selecting us because 30 years from now we will 
still be enjoying a good relationship with UC," said Ramsey, Visalia's director 
of research and development. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to prove goodwill, UC boosters in the valley lobbied hard and 
successfully for a decent margin of approval in last month's vote on 
Proposition 111, the state tax and spending changes that make campus 
construction possible. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a survey by the Tulare County Farm Bureau, which includes 
Visalia, found that while 60% of its members who responded want a UC campus in 
the area, 40% oppose it. Laurena Johnson, bureau executive director, said 
farmers worry about population growth, water shortages and air pollution. 
"While there is a lot of support for the campus, there is that other faction 
that says, 'Hey, if we don't make a stand now, our county is going to be so 
overrun with people,' " Johnson explained. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UC representative Aydelotte doesn't want people to lose sight of the 
real beneficiaries of a new campus. "Sometimes you get a question from a 10- or 
an 11-year-old and you realize this kid could be a freshman class member when 
this campus opens," he said. "It gives you pause."

SENATE PANEL URGES STIFF PENALTIES FOR DURENBERGER

In one of the harshest punishments it has ever recommended, the Senate Ethics 
Committee unanimously urged the full Senate Wednesday to denounce Sen. Dave 
Durenberger (R-Minn.) for "reprehensible" financial dealings and to require him 
to make restitution of more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan panel also suggested that Durenberger's Republican colleagues 
consider further disciplinary action, such as taking away choice committee 
assignments or leadership positions. The senator has been a prominent voice on 
health and intelligence issues in his 12 years in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In what it called a routine move, the Ethics Committee also referred two 
matters to the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission for 
possible prosecution. Committee leaders added, however, that they doubt there 
are grounds for criminal or civil charges. 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota senator is accused of circumventing Senate rules on honorariums, 
padding his expense account, accepting prohibited gifts from lobbyists and 
converting a campaign contribution to personal use. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger, 55, saying in an even voice that he is sorry for "serious 
mistakes," agreed at a news conference to make restitution "as a tangible sign 
of my regret and of my continuing commitment to the people of Minnesota." 
</P>
<P>
But he declined to say whether he would fight to have the other part of the 
penalty reduced from "denunciation" to "reprimand" when the matter comes to the 
Senate floor, probably later this month. The committee could have recommended 
expulsion from the Senate. In choosing denunciation, as suggested by its 
special counsel, Robert Bennett, the panel voted to reject the slightly 
stronger term, "censure." 
</P>
<P>
In the only other serious cases in the Ethics Committee's 26-year history, Sen. 
Thomas J. Dodd (D-Conn.) was censured by the full Senate for expense 
violations; Sen. Herman E. Talmadge (D-Ga.) was denounced for campaign fund 
abuses, and Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr. (D-N.J.) resigned in the face of 
certain expulsion for bribery in the Abscam scandal. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Ethics Committee Chairman Howell Heflin (D-Ala.) 
announced that the panel found that Durenberger's conduct "has been 
reprehensible and has brought the Senate into dishonor and disrepute." 
</P>
<P>
The panel recommended that he "be denounced" in a resolution that would be 
recited as he stands before his colleagues in the Senate chamber. For the first 
time in history, the committee also recommended that a colleague be made to pay 
a financial penalty for misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger would have to reimburse the Senate $29,050 plus interest for 
improperly claiming as a business expense rent on a Minneapolis condominium 
that he partly owned. 
</P>
<P>
The senator also would have to donate to charities most of the $95,000 he 
received in excess of Senate limits on speech honorariums. He could deduct from 
the figure an unknown amount of state and federal taxes already paid on the 
income. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), the committee's vice chairman, said that "none 
of the members of the committee are happy today. But the committee has done its 
duty to the institution and believes it has accorded Sen. Durenberger due 
process of law and fairness." 
</P>
<P>
At rare public hearings in June, special counsel Bennett laid out a detailed 
case against the senator. 
</P>
<P>
He charged that Durenberger evaded Senate limits on honorariums by disguising 
$95,000 worth of speaking fees as payments for promoting two books dealing with 
national security and health care issues in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Under agreement with Piranha Press of Minnesota, Durenberger had honorarium 
payments sent to the publisher, and the publisher in turn paid him fees for 
promotional services, Bennett said. When he neared the honorarium limit of 
$22,500 in 1985 and $30,040 in 1986, honorarium checks were routinely directed 
to Piranha Press, he said. 
</P>
<P>
James Hamilton, Durenberger's attorney, argued that the arrangement, which he 
said had been cleared with the Federal Election Commission, broke no rules. 
</P>
<P>
On another deal, Bennett contended that Durenberger improperly sought and 
received Senate reimbursement of $40,055 for living expenses outside of 
Washington from 1983 to 1989 by attempting to obscure ownership of a 
condominium that he owned in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett also said that Durenberger backdated a partnership agreement that 
included the condominium to justify part of the reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said that the transfer of ownership was legitimate and denied any 
attempt to hide the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger has said that his complex dealings stemmed largely from family and 
financial problems. He separated from his wife in 1985 and spoke publicly of a 
midlife crisis.

MASSIVE FRAUD BLAMED FOR 40% OF S&amp;L FAILURES; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: PROBER CITES CRIMINAL ACTIVITY BY DIRECTORS, MANAGERS. FIRMS SWAPPED 
BAD LOANS TO STAY AFLOAT.

<P>
Massive fraud caused the failure of 40% of the 450 savings and loans seized so 
far by the federal government, a top government investigator said Wednesday in 
the first specific estimate of the role that criminal activity has played in 
the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"It is fair to say 40% of the failures were caused by fraud and abuse by 
insiders . . . by criminal action by the owners, directors and managers," said 
James R. Dudine, assistant director for investigations at the Resolution Trust 
Corp., the agency in charge of operating insolvent thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Government agents have discovered also that the same persons tend to turn up 
repeatedly as borrowers at failed institutions and that many S&amp;Ls engaged 
in swapping and selling bad loans among themselves, Dudine said. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 15% of the failed S&amp;Ls hid their insolvencies for years, 
committing fraud by exchanging worthless loans with one another in an effort to 
hide the truth from government financial examiners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although government officials and legislators long have known that fraud was a 
problem at many S&amp;Ls, Dudine said that government experts have discovered 
far more worthless loans, false appraisals, kickbacks and direct fraud than 
they previously had suspected. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom has held that declining energy prices and weakening real 
estate markets caused hundreds of S&amp;Ls to collapse. However, Dudine's 
report makes it clear that criminal activity was the primary cause in the 
collapse of two of every five S&amp;Ls that failed. 
</P>
<P>
Dudine, whose agency has 200 investigators and plans to hire 100 more, 
delivered his surprising report during a meeting of the Oversight Board, which 
sets Resolution Trust Corp. policy. 
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office said in 1989 that fraud had been discovered at 
60% of the S&amp;Ls it had checked in a preliminary inquiry. However, the GAO 
report was based on a sample of only 26 institutions seized from 1985 through 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Dudine's report, in contrast, is based on a detailed, intensive inquiry by 
investigators of more than 400 of the 450 institutions seized by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"The most common experience is that an insider at the S&amp;L is responsible 
for (arranging) bad loans," Dudine said in an interview after the Oversight 
Board meeting. The loans eventually become uncollectible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators were surprised by the frequent exchanges of bad loans among 
S&amp;Ls, Dudine noted. "They were really insolvent for a couple of years," so 
"they look(ed) for ways to exchange assets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An S&amp;L, for example, might take a bad $10-million loan, on which no 
payments are being made, and exchange it for a worthless loan of the same 
amount from another institution. Each S&amp;L then can tell government 
examiners that the loan it just obtained is a sound investment. 
</P>
<P>
Because it will be some time before the loan's non-paying status becomes 
obvious, the institution can camouflage its financial problems and put off 
government regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Such swaps were found in about 15% of the S&amp;Ls seized so far by the 
government, according to Dudine. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, responding to growing taxpayer anger over the thrift scandal, House 
Democratic leaders on Wednesday announced broad proposals to stiffen criminal 
penalties for S&amp;L fraud and to prevent wrongdoers from keeping their 
profits. The proposed legislation would also supply more federal agents for the 
crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Besides handing prosecutors new tools, the legislation clearly is aimed at 
giving Democrats a new weapon in their election-year fight with Republicans and 
the Bush Administration over blame for the crisis and credit for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and other leaders 
asserted that the proposals go substantially beyond Administration requests. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to encourage the Bush Administration to fully prosecute all cases of 
S&amp;L fraud," Foley said at a news conference, "and we want to ensure that 
all possible funds are recovered wherever there is criminal conduct, so that 
the cost to the taxpayers can be as low as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Foley said that the S&amp;L package will be wrapped into an omnibus anti-crime 
measure scheduled for floor action next week. The provisions are similar to 
those approved by the Senate last week as part of its own crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision and a key 
coordinator of the multiagency task force combating S&amp;L fraud, said that 
the final legislative package by Congress should grant strong powers to the 
government to freeze assets of those being prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very, very important for us to . . . obtain a freeze on assets," Ryan 
told the Oversight Board. The ability to freeze assets is necessary, he said, 
so "there will be something there to recover in the end." 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic proposals would extend the potent Racketeer Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations Act to cover eight banking crimes, increase criminal 
penalties for fraud and bar from the banking business anyone convicted of a 
major bank offense. It would also create new offenses for concealing assets and 
obstructing audits. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the package would seek to prevent the use of "golden parachute" 
severance agreements, bankruptcy laws and other means to protect illegal gains 
from being seized in restitution orders. 
</P>
<P>
"We provide tools that law enforcement officials need to pierce the veil of 
financial protection that too many fraudulent operators have," said Rep. 
Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the bill's prime sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Schumer said that the legislation would provide retroactive power to go after 
the assets of such S&amp;L figures as developer Bill L. Walters, who is living 
in a $2-million home in Newport Beach, Calif., after defaulting on nearly $100 
million in loans obtained from a Denver thrift of which a business associate, 
Neil Bush, the President's son, was a director. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would also set up a bipartisan commission to study the causes 
of the S&amp;L crisis and to offer ideas for preventing another such scandal. 
That proposal is aimed at reducing the finger-pointing that has infected 
congressional debate on the debacle. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would authorize $459 million over three years for more prosecutors and 
investigators.

<P>
The Senate, setting Congress on a collision course with the White House after 
one of the most divisive and politically bruising debates this year, passed a 
major new civil rights bill Wednesday night that President Bush has said he 
will veto. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Bush's personal intervention in a last-minute attempt to negotiate a 
compromise, the Senate set aside objections by conservative Republicans and 
passed the Civil Rights Act of 1990 by a vote of 65 to 34. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials already have said that Bush will veto the legislation in 
its current form because of his belief that the bill would force companies to 
resort to minority quotas in their hiring practices. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with President Bush in 
Anaheim, said Wednesday night that the Administration was disappointed by the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll work to change it in the House. We still want a bill we can sign," 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement later, Fitzwater also said: "The President wants a bill 
that ends discrimination, not one that starts a quota system." 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights advocates, for whom passage of the job discrimination bill is a 
major victory, denied that it would impose a quota system on employers and 
predicted that Bush will be persuaded to drop his veto threat and support the 
bill by the time it reaches his desk later this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight's vote means we are going to get a strong civil rights bill this year, 
one that we still hope the President can be persuaded to support," said Ralph 
Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the main 
lobbying arm of the civil rights movement. "My guess is the discussions will 
continue as the bill moves through the House and we think there is a good 
chance that the President can be brought on board." 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), seeks to reverse 
several recent Supreme Court rulings that civil rights advocates said severely 
blunt the impact of existing federal laws against job discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Its provisions include bans on discrimination in the workplace and legal 
reforms that make it easier for employees to prove allegations of 
discrimination and seek punitive damages for them. It would also, for the first 
time, allow women to sue their employers and collect damages for sexual 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Rejecting arguments by conservative Republicans that his changes amounted to a 
sweeping and ill-conceived revision of the nation's civil rights laws, Kennedy 
and other Democratic supporters of the bill said the intent was simply to 
restore the force of laws that, prior to their modification by the Supreme 
Court, worked well for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to end the unequal treatment of minorities and women in the 
workplace," Kennedy said. ". . . The party of Lincoln should be the party for 
civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
While not disputing the Democrats' contention that the Supreme Court rulings 
necessitated a revision of job discrimination laws, the Bush Administration 
took sharp issue with two provisions in the bill that it argued would go beyond 
current law and impose unreasonable costs on employers. 
</P>
<P>
One deals with the ability of employees to challenge and seek damages for 
business practices that effectively exclude minorities from job opportunities 
even if they are not intended to be discriminatory. Under a law in effect since 
1971, such practices were justified only if a company could prove they were 
necessary to the performance of its business. The court, however, weakened that 
ruling in 1989 by relaxing the definition of what constituted a "business 
necessity" and by shifting the burden of proving that the practice was not 
necessary to the plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy bill sought to reverse that decision, taken in the case of Wards 
Cove vs. Antonio, and restore the effect of the original ruling in the 1971 
case of Griggs vs. Duke Power Co. 
</P>
<P>
However, Republicans said that the standards of proof companies would have to 
meet to defend themselves under the Kennedy bill were much too strict and would 
have the effect of forcing employers to hire minorities by quotas to turn back 
what could become a tidal wave of discrimination suits. 
</P>
<P>
"This is clearly a quota bill . . . and quotas are inescapably unfair," said 
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), explaining his decision to oppose the bill. "You 
do not cure old wrongs by imposing new ones. You do not cure old discrimination 
by imposing new discrimination." California's other senator, Democrat Alan 
Cranston, voted for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The other provision that the Bush Administration opposed dealt with the 
monetary awards that plaintiffs could receive if the court finds that they have 
been victims of intentional discrimination. Those awards, opponents said, could 
increase the incentive to file law suits and lead to a "legal bonanza" for 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly not wishing to pay the political price of vetoing a civil rights bill 
in an election year, the Bush Administration sought to negotiate a compromise 
with Senate Democrats. However, in large measure because of what civil rights 
advocates and even some Administration insiders said was a deep split within 
the White House, the negotiations eventually collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"There was obviously a split in the White House," said one supporter of the 
bill who was close to the negotiations. "There were a number of occasions where 
we added language to meet their objections and where we thought we had an 
agreement, only to find out the next day that we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
"Since these negotiations began eight weeks ago, a battle has been under way in 
the White House for the heart and soul of the President on the issue of civil 
rights and it is a battle that, so far, the right-wing of the White House has 
been winning," Neas said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Republicans were left deeply embittered by what they charged 
was an unwillingness by Kennedy to compromise and negotiate in good faith in 
the belief that he had enough votes to "cram this legislation down our 
throats," in the words of Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
"We went as far as we could go, we went a long way, but nothing seemed to 
please the other side," complained Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). "They were not 
interested in civil rights. They were interested in playing politics with civil 
rights," he charged. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy angrily rejected those charges, saying that it was the White House that 
refused to negotiate in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret that we have been unable to reach an agreement in these negotiations. 
But I make no apology . . . for refusing to accept so-called compromises that 
would undermine basic principles of civil rights," the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that the law specifically bars quotas, Kennedy accused the White House 
of manufacturing the quota controversy to disguise its opposition to civil 
rights legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"Quotas, schmotas. Quotas are not the issue. Job discrimination is the issue," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the battle over the bill left a bitter taste on both sides of the 
Senate's political aisle, Democrats and Republicans alike sought to keep the 
door open to further negotiations as the legislation moves through the House, 
where the bill is expected to be taken up shortly. 
</P>
<P>
Several senators noted that, in an election year especially, both sides have an 
incentive to continue those talks -- Republicans because they don't want to 
bear the onus of appearing to be against civil rights and Democrats because 
they may not have enough support to muster the 67 votes they will need to 
override a veto should Bush cast one. 
</P>
<P>
"We're confident that we have the votes to sustain the veto," Hatch said, 
adding that "we would then go back and draft a new bill that meets the 
President's objections by protecting civil rights rather than playing politics 
with them."

PLANNED PRESS CURBS AT NIXON DEDICATION EASED; 
</P>
<P>
LIBRARY: BUSH ADMINSTRATION OFFICIALS HAD CRITICIZED LIMITATIONS ON REPORTERS 
AT THE EVENT. A COMPROMISE IS STRUCK UNDER PRESSURE.

<P>
On the eve of its dedication, the Nixon Library once again became a center of 
controversy as Bush Administration officials Wednesday criticized limitations 
on press coverage imposed by the former President. 
</P>
<P>
But under pressure from the White House and news organizations, library 
officials announced a compromise under which reporters will be able to take 
part in a tour of the library today that previously was open only to 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Rules ordered by Ronald Walker, an aide to Richard M. Nixon -- at Nixon's 
request, according to Administration aides -- would have allowed only 
photographers to be present during major portions of the dedication today of 
the museum and library complex in this Orange County city. 
</P>
<P>
The rules would have been a sharp break from the usual coverage of White House 
events. 
</P>
<P>
After the criticism, library officials agreed to allow media representatives to 
accompany Presidents Bush, Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford on two of 
their four stops during a tour of the library. The media people will be 
permitted in the lobby of the library and around the reflecting pool outside 
the facility, but quarters will be too cramped for the entourage to join the 
Presidents in the World Leaders Room and at Nixon's birthplace next door, a 
library spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a space consideration and we've worked out an acceptable compromise, to 
the best of my knowledge," said the spokesman, who asked not to be named. 
"We're dealing with a numbers situation. We're not dealing with a cover-up." 
</P>
<P>
However, White House aides said they had originally been given a different 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"They just don't want anyone asking questions," one White House aide said, 
adding that the decision -- communicated to the White House over the weekend 
and to reporters who traveled to California with the Bush party Wednesday 
afternoon -- came as a surprise to Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Nixon library project has been repeatedly embroiled in controversy. Most 
recently, Hugh Hewitt, the library's executive director, told The Times that 
the library would bar researchers who were seen as anti-Nixon, specifically 
citing the Washington Post's Bob Woodward, who as a reporter helped break the 
Watergate story that led to Nixon's resignation. Hewitt later backed down, 
saying he had spoken without consulting Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
White House aides, however, said Walker, a longtime Nixon aide who is handling 
logistics for the library dedication, had specifically said the restriction on 
reporters was at the former President's request. Nixon has a long history of 
feuding with the press throughout his nearly five decades in public life. 
</P>
<P>
Even Nixon's quest for historical redemption of his presidency, a powerful 
subtext underlying many of this week's activities, has stirred some 
disagreement among the former President's admirers gathered in Southern 
California for the dedication. On Tuesday, former President Reagan said history 
would treat his predecessor well, adding that "much of the criticism was based 
on nothing at all." 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, former Nixon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, while 
agreeing that Nixon will be vindicated by history, took issue with the rest of 
Reagan's comments. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there were definite, huge errors," Kissinger said. "I have always 
believed that he was punished much too severely . . . but I think there were 
huge mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon himself has been mostly invisible in the events leading up to today's 
dedication. He briefly appeared with members of his family Wednesday as they 
arrived to tour his birthplace, but he declined to answer questions shouted 
from an area reserved for spectators. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the ceremonies for the opening of the library, Nixon plans to lead 
President Bush and Ford and Reagan on a tour of the library and his boyhood 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The tour will mark only the second time in history that so many U.S. Presidents 
have gathered. The last time was before the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar 
Sadat nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, any such appearance by Bush would be covered by a pool of reporters 
who cover the White House -- representatives of the two U.S. wire services, a 
newspaper reporter and a magazine reporter, one television network crew with a 
correspondent, a radio reporter and several photographers. Membership in the 
pool rotates daily among the news organizations that regularly cover the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
That pool format is used even during White House photo opportunities. Bush has 
made a rule of usually not answering questions during photo sessions, but 
reporters are allowed to ask them. Often, photo sessions provide the only 
opportunity for reporters to question the President on the events of the day.

CHAMORRO RULES BUT SANDINISTAS RETAIN POWER; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: BOTH SIDES WON -- AND LOST -- IN RECENT STRIKES. THE LEFTISTS PROVED 
THEY HAVE VETO POWER OVER THE NEW REGIME.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Daniel Ortega accepted his stunning defeat by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro 
in Nicaragua's presidential election last February, he vowed that the 
Sandinistas would "govern from below." 
</P>
<P>
Since Chamorro took office April 25, Sandinista unions have twice paralyzed the 
country with labor strikes -- proving not that Sandinistas control the 
government but certainly that Chamorro's conservative coalition cannot govern 
without Sandinista cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Sandinistas, who led an armed insurrection against the Somoza family 
dictatorship, will mark the 11th anniversary of their revolution. It is their 
first celebration as an opposition party, and they are likely to hail the 
strikes as their first major opposition victories. 
</P>
<P>
As Nicaragua's biggest, most organized political party, they have consistently 
exerted a veto power over the fragile Chamorro government. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-day walkout that ended last week, as well as a six-day civil servants' 
strike in May, have kept the government on the defensive, and Chamorro's inner 
circle of technocrats seem no match for the politically savvy Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
During this month's strike, workers and students barricaded streets and 
occupied buildings in Managua, shutting down government ministries, banks, the 
airport, state industries and travel across international borders. 
</P>
<P>
The strikers made wage demands, but their primary concern was economic policy. 
Sandinista peasants occupied thousands of acres of private and state-owned 
farms to protest government plans to rent the public lands and eventually 
return them to their pre-revolution owners. 
</P>
<P>
The government declared the strike illegal and refused to negotiate -- but when 
faced with chaos, officials backed down. The settlement, while far less than 
the Sandinistas had sought, forced the government to rein in its free-market 
economic program. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of state-owned lands and the return to private hands of the state 
textile industry, construction and other industries were effectively put on 
hold. On these and other economic policy decisions, the government agreed to 
consult the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that there are two powers here in Nicaragua," Roman Catholic 
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo declared Sunday after denouncing the strike 
violence, which left at least four dead and dozens wounded. "The new government 
and the Sandinistas -- two powers." 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas, however, have paid a price for their rough-and-tumble tactics: 
The barricades and burning tires buoyed the most militant party members, but 
Nicaraguans weary after more than a decade of a U.S.-backed war with the 
Contras are generally fed up with violence. Such confrontations are not likely 
to increase popular support for the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
If they are ever to govern again, the Sandinistas must transform their leftist 
vanguard movement into an unarmed, social democratic party capable of winning 
elections and international support -- and in that respect, the strike was a 
step backward. 
</P>
<P>
"The two sides were playing a negative-sum game," central bank President 
Francisco Mayorga, one of Chamorro's economic planners, said of the strike. "It 
was a war in which the loser is the one who loses the most. But both sides 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro, 60, remains a popular figure, diplomats and political analysts say, 
but her government was badly damaged by the crisis. Not only was the government 
unable to maintain public order for several days, but officials were absent 
from the public eye. State television installations were occupied by strikers; 
Chamorro's newspaper, La Prensa, did not publish, while the Sandinista daily, 
Barricada, and the pro-Sandinista Nuevo Diario did. 
</P>
<P>
"The government didn't exist for three days," one European diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Into that vacuum stepped ultra-conservative Vice President Virgilio Godoy, who 
announced the formation of a National Salvation Committee, challenging 
Chamorro's authority and handling of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The strike settlement prompted more criticism from the right wing of Chamorro's 
coalition, the National Opposition Union (UNO). 
</P>
<P>
Gilberto Cuadra, president of the Superior Council of Private Enterprise 
(COSEP), accused Chamorro of making "secret deals" with the Sandinistas and of 
abandoning her election commitment to a free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
"She has left behind her natural bases," Cuadra said in an interview. "She 
negotiated when she said she wouldn't. She lost lots of credibility." 
</P>
<P>
Besides underscoring strains between Chamorro on the one side and COSEP and 
some right-wing parties in the UNO coalition on the other, the strike also 
produced widespread rumors of tensions within her Cabinet. But Mayorga, the 
central bank president, denied reports that he was unhappy with the strike 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"COSEP has a right to pressure for rapid privatization, and I sympathize with 
that point of view," he said. "But the government has to accommodate the 
process to the national political (situation)." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the agreement, he insisted, sooner or later, the government will go 
forward with privatization. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a debate within the government about what is going to be privatized, 
when and how. But everything is subject to privatization under the program for 
which the people voted. Some things will be returned to their (prior) owners, 
some will be sold to workers and others will be sold to private investors," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayorga estimated the strike cost $24 million in lost production, plus damages 
to the streets of Managua, where cobblestones were taken up to build 
barricades. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's government had planned to privatize all state farms except those 
that once belonged to the Somoza family and its cronies. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas want the lands and industries to remain in state hands, not 
only for ideological reasons but also for self-interest: Along with the army, 
the peasant and public-sector unions form their strongest base of support. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Chamorro's government note that the strike agreement was 
negotiated by Ortega, the former president, and other Sandinistas, rather than 
by peasant and union leaders. They call the strike political "sabotage" rather 
than a labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista officials, however, say they were intermediaries between the 
government and their radical base. The party's National Directorate supported 
the strike but did not initiate it, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Sandinistas were trying to capitalize on economic discontent 
during the walkout. The new government had raised expectations with promises of 
private investment and Mayorga's early claim that he would halt inflation 
within 100 days. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation has continued to skyrocket, however. The cordoba, Nicaragua's 
national currency, has been devalued from about 70,000 to the dollar in April 
to more than 420,000 today. Strike leaders sought a guaranteed minimum wage 
pegged to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, neither the Sandinistas nor the government expected the violence, 
said one political analyst, Xabier Gorostiaga. He said a major concern for the 
Sandinista leadership was to prevent a confrontation between the Sandinista-led 
army and the unions. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the armed forces, which received high marks for restraint, may have 
won the most from the strike. No soldiers or police were killed, nor did they 
kill anyone, diplomats and other officials noted. 
</P>
<P>
"The army played it well," a European diplomat said. "They were smart. You 
didn't see them in the street until the moment (Chamorro) called them in. They 
were careful to respect what was happening (the strike), but no one could say 
they were acting illegally." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
After their revolution in 1979, the Sandinistas confiscated all the holdings of 
the ousted Somoza family and the plantations of many other wealthy landowners. 
Later, they sometimes confiscated the holdings of their political enemies. They 
gave land to about half the peasants in Nicaragua under a national agrarian 
reform program, and most were organized into cooperatives covering about 20% of 
all farmland. The state kept plantations totaling about 13% of the land, and 
these are managed with the participation of Sandinista unions.

NATION'S CAPITAL / LAGGING LUNCHTIME; 
</P>
<P>
TONY RESTAURANTS FEEL BITE OF DOWNTURN IN SPENDING FOR MEALS; 
</P>
<P>
A NEW ADMINISTRATION AND A SLOW ECONOMY ARE AMONG THE REASONS.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's lunchtime in the nation's capital, and places like Jean-Pierre -- the 
posh, oh-so-proper restaurant that has long been a favorite of expense-account 
diners like lawyers and lobbyists -- ordinarily are chock-full. Reservations 
are a must. 
</P>
<P>
But these days, there are plenty of available tables at Jean-Pierre -- and at 
dozens of other top Washington dining-spots -- and Jean-Michel Farret, the 
restaurant's Gallic, debonair maitre d'hotel, has time to sit and lament his 
plight. 
</P>
<P>
For a variety of reasons, business has fallen off sharply at Washington's 
tonier restaurants over the past several months, and many of them are hurting 
badly. Receipts at Jean-Pierre alone are down 30% to 40% from their levels of 
mid-1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the worst in the 20 years that we have been open," Farret says with a 
sigh. 
</P>
<P>
In any other city, this downturn might be brushed off as just another business 
slump, but in Washington it is taken as a sign of something really profound -- 
ranking right up there with the demise of the New Right or the opening up of 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants -- especially the more-expensive ones -- are important to the 
capital's essential being. If Napoleon's army marched on its stomach, 
Washington's Establishment rolls on its pastry-carts, government and private 
analysts agree. 
</P>
<P>
Let history here be your restaurant guide: Before he became President, Sen. 
John F. Kennedy (D-Mass.) made the Rive Gauche, a Georgetown restaurant, 
famous. Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger once held court at the 
Sans Souci -- which since has closed. 
</P>
<P>
And during the early and mid-1980s, top aides to then-President Ronald Reagan 
regularly lunched at the Maison Blanche, which is only a hop-skip-and-a-jump 
from its English-language namesake at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W. 
</P>
<P>
But those were the salad days. Today, under President Bush, Washingtonians 
literally are tightening their belts. Top government officials all but shun 
higher-priced luncheons. Lobbyists are scaling back. Even the free-spending 
Japanese are on a diet. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kinkead, chef-owner at 21 Federal, contends the changeover in the White 
House is at least partly to blame. During the Reagan years, he says, buying big 
lunches for people was the in thing to do -- like merging with a corporate 
rival or leveraging an S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly since Bush has been in office, there's been a curtailment of the 
kind of opulent spending that used to go on during the Reagan years," Kinkead 
asserts. "Now people are having to pay the piper for what they were doing back 
then." 
</P>
<P>
William Urquiola, a table captain at Ristorante Tiberio along Washington's 
business-laden K Street corridor, also cites the Bush Administration's 
stepped-up enforcement of a law prohibiting senior officials from accepting 
lunches from lobbyists and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
A bureaucrat who has to pay for his own meal isn't likely to want to eat at 
Tiberio's, where lunch for two can cost $100 or more, Urquiola explains. 
Instead, he -- or she -- is likely to start going to less-expensive 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The weakened economy here -- particularly in Washington's once-red-hot 
real-estate business -- also plays a part. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is a plethora of related reasons -- Mayor Marion Barry's 
narcotics trial and Washington's growing reputation (deserved or not) as 
America's Murder Capital. "Everything's tied in," Kinkead says. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there is one way the big, expensive restaurants here might regain 
old customers -- by (shudder) lowering prices, something other businesses do 
routinely when the going gets rough. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts here say that is going to be difficult for Washington's 
credit-card establishments to do. After all, reducing prices too obviously can 
destroy a restaurant's upscale image. "There's a big difference between dining 
and eating -- eating is a must; dining is not necessary," Farret points out.

Does this sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
A huge sporting event is coming to town, bringing the curious eyes of the world 
with it, not to mention the prospects of unbearable commuter gridlock. Years of 
planning and debate, and millions of dollars, go on the line for just a few 
summer days in which young men and women from around the globe converge -- to 
jump, swim, lift, dive, row, pedal and otherwise sweat and strain for 
celebrated medals that will proclaim them champions. 
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Just as Los Angeles awaited the 1984 Olympics, Seattle, its breath held tight, 
now awaits Friday's beginning of Ted Turner's 1990 Goodwill Games, the most 
heavily promoted event in the Pacific Northwest since the 1962 World's Fair of 
Space Needle fame. 
</P>
<P>
The Goodwill Games are cable television magnate Turner's efforts to encourage 
friendly international competition through athletics. The first games were held 
in Moscow four years ago under decidedly more chilly political conditions, 
after the U.S. Olympic boycott of 1980 and the U.S.S.R. boycott of the 1984 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
But, today, goodwill seems a name wholly in step with goodwill times. 
</P>
<P>
Stores here fly the big red hammer-and-sickle alongside Old Glory. Soviet 
aircraft are landing at the local airport alongside locally made Boeing 
jetliners. Soviet tourists are treated as celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
East-West cultural and artistic exchanges that accompany the games are touted 
as being without modern precedent. By one count, 35 separate arts events are 
tied to the games, as are conferences on everything from human rights to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Simply, Seattle is gaga over the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the games are much more international than just a match of 
superpowers. Organizers say that 2,500 athletes from about 50 countries will 
compete in 21 sports during a 17-day contest. Unlike the Olympics, which 
feature rounds and rounds of eliminations, these games are described as "finals 
only." 
</P>
<P>
ANXIETY OVER OUTCOME 
</P>
<P>
With the world knocking on its door, Seattle is a city on the spot this summer. 
Residents of Los Angeles would recognize the familiar civic hand-wringing over 
what image the games might fix in the eyes of a television audience that is 
supposed to reach 72 countries. Will the already crowded transportation system 
freeze up under the strain? Who pays for the extra services? What defines 
success? Who deserves blame for failure? 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Los Angeles, however, Seattle is still a community in search of its 
self-image. 
</P>
<P>
Some promoters figure the picturesque Northwest settings and red-carpet welcome 
will increase Seattle's prestige. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the Goodwill Arts Festival has critics swooning over Seattle as a 
paragon of culture. Business leaders believe they can gain a jump on the world 
in welcoming the eastern Soviet Union into the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
"Very important trade and other implications," the municipal convention bureau 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
But the chest-pounding occurs at a time when the Puget Sound region of 
Washington is deep in debate over growth. Enough-is-too-much groups like the 
locally famous "Lesser Seattle" fear that blissful accounts of life and 
commerce in the verdant greens of the Northwest will stimulate the crowding 
that jeopardizes the very things that make Seattle so livable. 
</P>
<P>
FUTURE OLYMPICS? 
</P>
<P>
Competition begins Friday, although welcoming ceremonies will not occur until 
Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle is likely to get all the credit -- or blame -- for the games, but 
neighboring Tacoma and other cities are hosts to select events. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan will be the ranking politician-guest, President 
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev having demurred. Seattle also 
made attempts to attract other celebrities, including offering Nelson Mandela a 
reported $100,000 honorarium. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcaster and showman Turner is expected to be in the limelight himself 
during the games, along with his sometimes companion, actress Jane Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
There has been substantial worry over the quality of the athletes competing. As 
late as Tuesday, organizers said they were not sure whether to expect the 
Soviet Union's top athlete, pole-vaulter Sergey Bubka. Familiar American names 
who are on the lineup include sprinter and long-jumper Carl Lewis, who kept the 
city on edge before saying yes, along with swimmer Matt Biondi, who holds seven 
Olympic medals. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, though, the games are just a start. When the up-and-down ticket 
sales are tallied, when the number of new world records is posted, when the 
merchants count their receipts, when the sporting world passes judgment on the 
Northwest, Seattle boosters hope the city will show itself ready for the real 
games -- the first Olympics of the 21st Century.

ABBOTT PITCHES COMPLETE GAME, BUT ANGELS COME UP SHORT, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Abbott had the right idea in his last start, pitching a shutout against the 
Toronto Blue Jays to assure himself no worse than a tie. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old left-hander was only marginally less effective Wednesday 
against the Milwaukee Brewers, but the Angels' inconsistent offense gave him no 
margin for error. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to get too caught up in results," Abbott said after pitching his 
second consecutive complete game and third in four starts, only to wind up with 
a 3-2 loss at Anaheim Stadium. "Sure, I'd like to win. I'm real disappointed 
that we didn't. But for the most part, I've got to look upon this start as 
being positive. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Mark Langston. It's just not happening for him, and he's pitching 
great. He's not winning, but it doesn't mean he's 
</P>
<P>
any less of a pitcher. That's how I have to look at this. When you start 
punishing yourself for good games, that's when you get in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Maturity and mechanical adjustments have made Abbott a better pitcher than he 
was even a month or two ago, but his record hasn't reflected that because the 
Angels' offense hasn't provided much support. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott (6-8) pitched an outstanding game, except for a tenuous first inning 
complicated by a mixup in signs with catcher Ron Tingley that turned into a 
passed ball and set up Dave Parker's two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Deer muscled a 2-and-0 fastball into the seats in left-center field in the 
second inning -- "The only bad pitch he threw," according to Angel Manager Doug 
Rader -- to provide the Brewers' final run, and although Abbott allowed only 
four more hits, that run was decisive. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring eight runs Tuesday night for Kirk McCaskill, the Angels mustered 
only two for Abbott off Mark Knudson (7-4), the first on Johnny Ray's home run 
in the fifth and two singles and a sacrifice fly by Dave Winfield in the sixth. 
In Abbott's 19 starts, the Angels have been outscored, 99-72. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, who has yet to win consecutive games this season, struck out three and 
didn't allow a walk for the second consecutive start. Over his last four 
starts, he has allowed six earned runs in 34 1/3 innings for an earned-run 
average of 1.57. His overall ERA is 4.19, his lowest since the second game of 
the season. And his record remains below .500. So does the Angels', at 45-47. 
</P>
<P>
"We've squandered some good pitching," Winfield said. "We're unpredictable, 
that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
That's all they can be sure of. 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched a great game," said Max Venable, whose hit-and-run single in the 
sixth inning moved Luis Polonia to third base and into position to score on 
Winfield's fly ball. "It seems (Langston) and Abbott, we don't score a lot of 
runs for them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not fair. There's not much justice. We've got to have a few more 
guys hitting and pull things together. We're not balanced offensively very 
well. The chemistry is not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
The delicate chemistry between pitcher and catcher went awry in the first 
inning when Tingley, who was recalled from triple-A Edmonton on Tuesday, gave 
Abbott the wrong sign on an 0-and-1 pitch to Parker, after singles by Robin 
Yount and Gary Sheffield. 
</P>
<P>
"The sequence I'd gone through, I thought I'd given the sign for a fastball 
inside and I didn't -- I gave the sign for a breaking ball," said Tingley, who 
last caught Abbott during a brief exhibition outing in Palm Springs. "I set up 
for a fastball and it got away from me. That killed us. It put runners on 
second and third. I was getting a little anxious behind the plate wanting to 
get out of a jam. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute I got out there (to the mound) I said, 'Hey, it's my fault. Now 
let's shut them down.' " 
</P>
<P>
Except for Parker's single and Deer's home run, Abbott did. "He was in such a 
good groove, I could have thrown down any (sign)," Tingley said. 
</P>
<P>
By then, though, the damage was done, and the Angels were incapable of doing 
much offensive damage of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked to see what would have happened in the first inning if the 
passed ball had not occurred," Rader said. "It changed the way the whole inning 
was set up. . . . The inning would have been a lot different had that not taken 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott deflected the blame from Tingley and downplayed the impact of that play. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had the first inning back," he said. "Some things that happened might 
have been avoided. (Working with Tingley) went real well except the first 
inning, and that was my fault. There were some other things, too. That wasn't 
the key. There were different pitches that could have been made. I should have 
known that. I think Ron did a great job back there as soon as he got used to my 
pitching pattern, and that's to his credit because it's not always easy to pick 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott has found that victories aren't easy to pick up, either, but he is 
encouraged by his improvement. If that hasn't yet translated into improvement 
in his record, he intends to be patient. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to speak too prematurely," he said. "But I give a lot of credit 
to (pitching coach) Marcel Lachemann. Mechanically, a lot of things have come 
together and that's led to more consistency throwing the ball over the plate 
with all four pitches. Because of that, that's turned into quality starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just got to keep at it. This is not the end of the world. Maybe I'll win 
a few 9-8 games or 7-6 games and everybody will forget about it." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Today will be a day off for the Angels, their first at home since April 16. 
Another day off scheduled during a home stand in May was wiped out by a makeup 
game in Seattle. Other days off have actually been travel days. . . . Manager 
Doug Rader held a workout on an off day during a trip in April but left today 
open. "They need to rest their minds," said Rader, who plans a morning round of 
golf, an afternoon at the beach and time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Abbott's plans include playing golf. "Maybe you'd better not say that," he 
said, referring to General Manager Mike Port's recent ban on bringing golf 
clubs on the road. . . . Abbott's complete game was the Angels' third in four 
games. Only one was a victory -- Chuck Finley's 3-2 decision over Toronto 
Sunday. Mark Langston had a complete-game 3-1 loss to Milwaukee Monday. The 
Angels' staff has 10 complete games this season, three each by Langston and 
Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels took the season series from Milwaukee, 7-5, for the second 
consecutive season. . . . Johnny Ray's home run in the fifth inning was the 
Angels' 18th against the Brewers this season, the most they have hit against a 
single club since they got 18 against the New York Yankees in 1988. . . . Chili 
Davis, who has a strained lower back, is receiving therapy, but Wally Joyner, 
who had a possible stress fracture in his right kneecap, is limited to 
upper-body work.

OWNERS TAKE A THIRD STRIKE ON COLLUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In the wake of victories in the cases known as Collusion I and II, the Major 
League Baseball Players Assn. was notified by arbitrator George Nicolau 
Wednesday that it has also won Collusion III. 
</P>
<P>
Don Fehr, the union's executive director, said the three-for-three sweep should 
translate to at least $200 million in compensation for the players affected by 
a conspiracy that restricted movement and salaries in the winters after the 
1985, '86 and '87 seasons. The owners have placed damages at $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only the remedial penalties for Collusion I have been announced. 
Arbitrator Tom Roberts set penalties of $10.5 million on Aug. 31, 1989, but has 
yet to announce how it will be distributed and to whom. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolau is expected to announce damages from the Collusion II case before the 
end of this season, but Fehr said Wednesday he will be meeting with Nicolau and 
Charles O'Connor, executive director of the owners' Player Relations Committee, 
in an attempt to (1) reach a compromise settlement on damages from the three 
collusion cases and (2) formulate a system of organized distribution as opposed 
to a piecemeal one. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have to litigate every claim, the stain of collusion will go on 
forever," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of collusion has been credited, so to speak, to former baseball 
commissioner Peter Ueberroth. Current Commissioner Fay Vincent has said he will 
not tolerate the process during his administration, and the new collective 
bargaining agreement contains assurances by management that it will pay treble 
damages if guilty of collusion again. 
</P>
<P>
After a long period of incendiary relations, Fehr said there is reason for 
optimism. He cited the free market of last winter, the safeguards in the new 
agreement and his belief that there will be a good-faith attempt to settle the 
issue of collusion damages and distribution without a rash of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-six free agents from the winter of 1987-88 are affected by the 
Collusion III decision, including Jack Morris, Gary Gaetti, Dave Righetti, Paul 
Molitor, Jack Clark, Greg Minton, Mike Witt, Chili Davis and Brett Butler. Some 
could receive what is known as new-look free agency, such as was granted Kirk 
Gibson as part of Collusion I, allowing him to move from the Detroit Tigers to 
the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of the union's Collusion III case centered on the information bank, a 
process by which clubs immediately filed their offers to free agents with the 
Player Relations Committee, which then made the information available to other 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that there were a number of free-agency contracts signed before and 
during the 1987-88 free-agent market does not mean that the market itself was 
'free and unencumbered,' " Nicolau wrote in his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"The (information) bank's message was plain -- if we must go out into that 
market and bid, then let's quietly cooperate by telling each other what the 
bids are. If we all do that, prices won't get out of line and no club will be 
hurt too much." 
</P>
<P>
The owners dissolved the information bank after the union filed its grievance. 
Said O'Connor, in a prepared statement Wednesday: "We strongly disagree with 
his ruling, but it should be understood that the events occurred over two years 
ago. The clubs hope that the parties can put litigation behind them and 
continue the work of developing a productive relationship."

MARTINEZ ADDS ANOTHER NOTCH TO HIS BELT OF BIG-PITCH VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the All-Star game, the victim was Jose Canseco. Three days later, it was 
Ryne Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, St. Louis' Vince Coleman became exhibit No. 3 in support of 
the theory that nobody in the National League throws a big pitch like Dodger 
pitcher Ramon Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez protected a two-run lead by striking out Coleman with runners on first 
and second in the sixth inning and the Cardinals never threatened again in the 
Dodgers' 6-1 victory before 25,328 at Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez did more than record his 11th victory while striking out eight in 
seven innings to increase his major league leading total to 142. He proved, for 
a third consecutive game, that one can appreciate his night's work by watching 
him face only one batter. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys get in tight situations and suddenly start making bad pitches," 
Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia said. "Ramon does not change. It has to do with 
his makeup. He's real cool out there." 
</P>
<P>
In winning for the fifth time in seven games on this trip, the Dodgers were 
helped by Hubie Brooks' fourth three-hit game of a season, improving an 
admittedly disappointing average to .253. His night included three singles, two 
RBIs and two runs scored. Eddie Murray added his 12th homer. 
</P>
<P>
But, as usual, when the 22-year-old Martinez pitches, he produced the big play. 
</P>
<P>
In a confrontation in last week's All-Star game, Martinez retired Oakland's 
Canseco on a two-out grounder with runners on first and second in the third 
inning of a scoreless tie. In the Dodgers' 5-2 victory over Chicago Friday, he 
struck out Sandberg with the go-ahead run on third base in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
He stretched his big-pitch streak to three games Wednesday after the Cardinals 
had scored with two out in the sixth on an infield single by Todd Zeile and a 
grounder by Terry Pendleton that skipped off Murray's glove at first base for a 
two-base error, only Murray's fourth. Martinez then walked Jose Oquendo, 
bringing up Coleman, who was pinch-hitting for Craig Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew if I walk Coleman, I've got big trouble," Martinez said. "I knew I had 
to pitch to him." 
</P>
<P>
They battled to a full count. Then Coleman fouled off four pitches before 
Martinez received a nudge from Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had struck out Coleman before on fastballs, but they had all been 
outside," Martinez said. "I look and see Scioscia calling for a fastball 
inside. All I had to do was get it there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not nervous. I'm just thinking about what I got to do. And then I do it." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman swung and missed and the National League East's last-place Cardinals 
eventually fell to their fifth loss in seven games. The Dodgers took the season 
series, 7-5, including winning five of six games at Busch Stadium after being 
swept in six games here last season. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who allowed one unearned run in seven innings, lowered his earned-run 
average to 2.97. He has allowed more than two runs twice in his last 11 starts. 
Jay Howell, finally throwing as he did last season, pitched two perfect innings 
to record his fourth save in four appearances covering six games. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda was totally thrilled. He loves watching 
Martinez winning dramatic confrontations as much as the next fan, but said that 
Martinez should not make things so tough on himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets in too many deep (three-ball) counts," Lasorda said, unhappy that 
Martinez needed 125 pitches to get through seven innings. "When he gets better 
command of his stuff, that's when he'll be a better pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda warned that Martinez's coolness may not hold up under repeated fire. 
</P>
<P>
"When you put yourself in that position, you are treading on thin ice," he 
said. "You have got to throw the ball over the plate. And sometimes you might 
feel you have to let up on the pitch a bit to make that happen. 
</P>
<P>
"When you let up a bit, that is when you get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, Brooks hopes he will finally start pouring it on. Since his 
three-run homer beat San Diego on opening day, he has alternated big hits with 
long cold spells. 
</P>
<P>
However, he has hit safely in 11 of his last 13 games, at a .320 pace. And even 
if he has had only one homer in his last 108 at-bats, he said he will be happy 
if his swing has finally become consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned, I've got to forget about the past part of the season and just go 
forward," Brooks said.

After Murray's homer to start the sixth made it 2-0. Brooks followed with a 
single, and later scored on Alfredo Griffin's suicide squeeze bunt. In the 
eighth inning against former Dodger reliever Tom Niedenfuer, Brooks singled and 
eventually scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Then in the ninth, after Murray was intentionally walked to load the bases, 
Brooks singled to center against just-entered reliever Scott Terry to score two 
runs. Brooks, like Martinez, is best in the big play. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The game was delayed 23 minutes at the outset because of rain. . . . Replays 
showed that the Cardinals did not score their only run of the game, as Mike 
Scioscia tagged Todd Zeile after he missed home plate while trying to score on 
Eddie Murray's error. But Zeile, shielded from home plate umpire Fred 
Brocklander by Scioscia, crawled to the plate, and was ruled safe. "He may have 
touched the plate between the sixth and seventh tags I put on him, but that's 
it," Scioscia said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda had lunch at the home of former Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog. 
Lasorda said he told Herzog that he never would have quit, as Herzog did 
recently. "I told him, 'I am not giving this job to anybody,' " Lasorda said. 
"They are going to have to take this job from me." . . . When pinch-hitter 
Chris Gwynn flied to center while batting for Ramon Martinez in the eighth, it 
was only his seventh at-bat since July 4. Gwynn, who has 75 at-bats this 
season, is one of four seemingly forgotten Dodgers. Others with fewer than 100 
at-bats are Rick Dempsey, Jose Gonzalez and Mickey Hatcher.

TOUR DE FRANCE;

A FLAT TIRE DOESN'T DEFLATE LEMOND

<P>
For one scary moment, Greg LeMond thought all was lost in his bid to win 
another Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through Wednesday's 17th stage of the Tour, a 93-mile run from Lourdes 
to Pau, LeMond was stopped by a flat tire. And his team car carrying the spare 
was nowhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have lost the Tour de France today," LeMond said. "I got very scared," 
LeMond said. "It just goes to show things aren't won in advance yet." 
</P>
<P>
But LeMond lost only a minute to the pack he was riding in, which included 
overall leader Claudio Chiappucci and challenger Pedro Delgado. His teammates, 
using a pacing relay system, managed to keep the leaders within striking 
distance for LeMond. 
</P>
<P>
The tire was replaced, LeMond finished strongly and remained five seconds 
behind Chiappucci entering today's 18th stage of the 21-stage Tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sure that they went faster because of it," LeMond said, referring to his 
tire problems. "When I got back I told Chiappucci I wouldn't forget this." 
</P>
<P>
Dimitri Konyshev won the 17th stage to become the first Soviet to win a leg of 
the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado was looking to improve from his third spot, 3:49 back, and his Banesto 
teammates, along with Chiappucci's, picked up the pace when LeMond was stopped. 
But his teammates helped him out. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter to stop for our leader," Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle said. 
"Especially when Greg comes up and makes a point to say, 'Thank you,' in the 
evening." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, LeMond was still second and didn't give up any time to Delgado, 
either. Delgado remained 3:42 behind Chiappucci and Eric Breukink was fourth, 
3:49 back. LeMond wound up 15th in Wednesday's stage, Chiappucci 13th and 
Delgado 37th. 
</P>
<P>
Konyshev broke away from the main pack with about 20 others but gradually the 
group whittled down to Konyshev and Belgium's Johan Bruyneel. Konyshev won in 
the sprint, waving and clapping his arms about his head when he finished in 4 
hours 8 minutes 25 seconds, more than five minutes in front of LeMond and 
Chiappucci. 
</P>
<P>
Konyshev is a member of an Italian team that is comprised of nine Soviet 
cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the 18th stage brings the riders back to the flatland with a ride to 
Bordeaux. After another flat stage on Friday, Saturday's stage features the 
time trial in Lac de Vassiviere, where LeMond won his first stage of the Tour 
de France in 1985.

An angry Norm Stewart, denying he misled NCAA investigators looking into 
allegations of wrongdoing in the Missouri basketball program, vowed to carry 
his fight through NCAA hearings and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
"I am willing to assume at this point that the NCAA process will provide me 
with a fair opportunity," Stewart said. "If the NCAA gives me a fair hearing, I 
am confident I will prevail against the allegation. But if the NCAA process 
does not provide me with a fair hearing, I intend to go beyond that process to 
be heard."

Dennis Gilbert, a Beverly Hills sports agent, has denied, in a letter to The 
Times in response to a recent story, that he is under investigation by the 
Major League Baseball Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
His letter states: "The allegations in the article about me were from an 
'unnamed source,' they were made over a year ago, and they were untrue." 
</P>
<P>
A story that appeared in The Times on July 11 reported that Gilbert was the 
subject of an investigation, according to a source close to the union and that 
the main allegations center on Gilbert's alleged violations of agent 
regulations by soliciting clients and retaining them with inducements. Gilbert 
declined interview requests before the story appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Orza, associate general council for the union who also oversees the agent 
regulation program, said Wednesday: "It is the Association's policy not to 
comment on whether an agent is being investigated or not, and I'm not going to 
confirm or deny whether Mr. Gilbert or any other agent is under investigation. 
I will just repeat what I said previously that Dennis Gilbert is a certified 
agent and therefore as a certified agent obviously has not been found to have 
committed any improprieties that would justify altering his status." MARYANN

SCOTT FINDS OLD STUFF AND BEATS METS, 1-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Scott, coming off his first 20-victory season, was looking forward to 
bigger things in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But the first half of this season was most forgettable for the Houston 
right-hander. There were few good things that happened. He could remember the 
game early in June in which he struck out 15 batters, but that was one of the 
few pleasant memories. 
</P>
<P>
He was pitching so poorly, with an earned-run average about 5.00, that teams 
even stopped complaining that he was doctoring the baseball. 
</P>
<P>
From the time the New York Mets complained after he beat them twice in the 1986 
championship series, Scott was frequently checked for illegal substances. 
</P>
<P>
So, when he finally regained the form of a year ago Wednesday night at Houston, 
it was satisfying to him that he beat the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Scott won, 1-0, giving up four hits, striking out four and walking none. The 
loss dropped the Mets two games behind Pittsburgh in the NL East. 
</P>
<P>
Scott (7-9) opposed 13-game winner Frank Viola in a scoreless battle through 
seven innings, but with former Dodger Alejandro Pena pitching in the eighth, 
the Astros pushed across a run. 
</P>
<P>
Scott played a part in the winning rally. After Dave Rohde singled, Scott 
walked. An infield hit loaded the bases. After a strikeout, rookie Javier Ortiz 
singled in the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
The last hit off Scott may have cost the Mets the game. It was a two-out double 
by Todd Hundley in the eighth. Manager Bud Harrelson sent Mackey Sasser to bat 
for Viola, who gave up only three hits in seven innings. But Sasser didn't come 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the type of game you wish you were back in the American League," Viola 
said. "They wouldn't have to make the decision because pitchers don't bat 
anyhow. But, what can you do? I'm never going to like being hit for. I guess 
it'll always be that way in this league." 
</P>
<P>
Houston Manager Art Howe was glad Harrelson had to make the decision. "We got 
the best pitcher on their club out of the game. It was probably a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 8, Montreal 7 -- Even though the Reds increased their lead over San 
Francisco in the West to 8 1/2 games with the victory at Cincinnati, it will 
not go down as one of Manager Lou Piniella's better days. 
</P>
<P>
It began with him having to deny that he was involved in gambling or was part 
of the reason for Yankee owner George Steinbrenner's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Before the night was done, Piniella was ejected, then sat in the clubhouse 
while the Reds' blew a 7-3 lead on a grand slam by Andres Galarraga with two 
out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the bottom of the 11th, Barry Larkin tripled and Paul O'Neill singled 
him home for the Reds' fourth win in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the cheapest, luckiest hit," O'Neill said. "But I'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
What made blowing the lead so exasperating for Piniella was that Randy Myers, 
as effective a relief pitcher as there has been in the league this season, 
failed to hold the four-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
Galarraga's slam was his second homer of the game. The first one came with a 
man on and put the Expos in front, 3-2, in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 11, San Francisco 2 -- Manager Jim Leyland was hoping his top 
pitcher, Doug Drabek, could put an end to the Pirates' three-game losing streak 
at home. But it was an unexpected bonus when the right-hander helped the 
Pirates break out of their hitting slump. 
</P>
<P>
Drabek, a .140 hitter against the rest of the league, thrives on Giant 
pitching. He went two for four, scored a run and drove in another. Against the 
Giants, he is five for 11, including a home run. 
</P>
<P>
With Jeff King hitting a home run and driving in five runs, it was easy for 
Drabek (11-4). He went eight innings, giving up seven hits, and the performance 
enabled the Pirates to take a two-game lead over the Mets in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good pitcher, he has good control and he knows how to pitch," Giant 
Manager Roger Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, San Diego 2 -- Cub Manager Don Zimmer couldn't keep his promise. He 
vowed that if Greg Maddux would win a game, he would swim Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux (5-9), had not won since May 5, losing eight in a row with five no 
decisions in 13 previous starts while compiling a 6.15 ERA. The victory was 
Maddux's 50th major league win. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of the big swim, Zimmer showed up at the postgame interview wearing 
royal blue sun glasses, a life jacket and had a buoy strapped over his legs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure I could do it with this stuff on," Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rasmussen (7-7), gave up eight hits in six innings, losing his third in 
a row and the fifth in his last six starts. He was hurt by third baseman Eddie 
Williams' fifth inning throwing error, which allowed two runs to score with two 
out and the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs have won four in a row and the Padres have lost 16 of their last 19. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, Atlanta 3 -- Ricky Jordan's two-run double highlighted a 
three-run eighth inning at Atlanta to bring the Phillies from behind. 
</P>
<P>
John Smoltz (6-7) had a 3-1 lead and had yielded only four hits before the 
Phillies erupted. 
</P>
<P>
There were two out and two on when Smoltz walked Carmelo Martinez and John Kruk 
to force in a run. Jordan followed with his two-run double to put the Phillies 
in front. DAN HAFNER

A'S PLAY PAIR OF ACES AND DEAL INDIANS 4-1 AND 5-2 DEFEATS

Bob Welch of the Oakland Athletics has the best record of any pitcher in the 
majors, but his manager, Tony La Russa, says his record doesn't show how good 
he has really been. 
</P>
<P>
Welch held the Cleveland Indians to six hits in eight innings and improved his 
record to 15-3 Wednesday when he pitched the A's to a 4-1 victory in the first 
game of a doubleheader at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics turned on the power for Dave Stewart (12-8) and won the nightcap, 
5-2, to extend their lead in the American League West to 1 1/2 games over the 
Chicago White Sox. Jose Canseco hit two home runs and Mark McGwire and Jamie 
Quirk also homered. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Eckersley retired three batters in the opener and two in the second game 
to get his 29th and 30th saves. 
</P>
<P>
Candy Maldonado spoiled Welch's bid for a shutout when he hit his 14th home run 
in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the continued absence of the one-two hitters in the batting order, it was 
the eight-nine batters who led the Athletics' offense in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
With Rickey Henderson and Carney Lansford injured, Walt Weiss and Mike Gallego 
keyed the offense. The double play combination had a hand in all four runs. 
Weiss had four hits, scoring twice and driving in a run, and Gallego had one 
hit, driving in a run and scoring another. 
</P>
<P>
Of Welch, La Russa said: "He's had the toughest two losses in the league, a 
freak injury contributed to a third and he still hasn't pitched a bad game this 
year. He is a fantastic pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Welch had a 10-game winning streak ended July 5 in Milwaukee, shortly after 
sliding into a railing behind home plate while catching a foul pop in the 
second inning. He had to leave after the next inning because of a hip injury 
received on the play. 
</P>
<P>
It is his only loss since May 5. In that 5-1 defeat at Boston, Welch gave up 
one earned run in seven innings. In his other defeat, April 20, Brian Holman of 
Seattle, had a perfect game for 8 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worrying about number of victories or anything else," Welch said. "I'm 
just concentrating on every pitch, pitch by pitch." 
</P>
<P>
This was Welch's 20th start. Although he has only two complete games, he has 
gone seven or more innings 13 times. The only time he failed to go into the 
sixth was the game in which he had to leave because of the hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
The A's brought up Canseco's twin brother Ozzie, despite a .229 average at 
double-A Huntsville, Ala. He struck out as a pinch-hitter in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 7, Detroit 5 -- The White Sox, trailing 5-4 going into the ninth at 
Detroit, faced the prospect of falling 2 1/2 games behind Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
But Sammy Sosa hit his second two-run double of the game to give the White Sox 
another victory. 
</P>
<P>
Donn Pall (2-4) got the win with ninth-inning relief help from Bobby Thigpen, 
who earned his 31st save, tops in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Cecil Fielder hit his 30th home run for the Tigers. The long homer to center 
triggered a four-run rally in the sixth that put Detroit ahead, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 7, Baltimore 1 -- Rafael Palmeiro had four hits, including a home run, 
and Bobby Witt struck out 10 at Arlington, Tex., winning his fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Palmeiro also drove in three runs. He is 14 for 29 with 11 RBIs in his last 
seven games. He has nine hits in his last 13 at-bats. He has raised his average 
to .325. 
</P>
<P>
Palmeiro's 10th homer of the season, a two-run shot in the third inning, gave 
Texas a 3-0 lead. His RBI single highlighted a three-run fifth that made it 
6-0. Texas had lost three in a row after a seven-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Palmeiro hit his homer off Dave Johnson (8-6), who has given up 22 home runs, 
tops in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 5, Toronto 2 -- Matt Young's pitching overcame Matt Young's throwing at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Young (4-10) pitched a two-hitter and defeated the Blue Jays despite his two 
throwing errors and two more errors by third baseman Edgar Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Young's two-base wild throw contributed to the Blue Jays' runs in the fourth 
inning. He leads major league pitchers with eight errors. In large part because 
of his own fielding, he leads the league with 14 unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a wild throw in Boston in 1985," Young said, "and it's been a mental 
block ever since." 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners had 13 hits, including Pete O'Brien's first home run since May 2. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Kansas City 3 -- In one of the most dismal seasons in their 
history, the Yankees may have someone to cheer about. Rookie outfielder Oscar 
Azocar hit a single, double and home run in his first start at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals' Bo Jackson, who dislocated his shoulder after hitting three home 
runs Tuesday night, did not play and may miss three more games. DAN HAFNER

Doesn't anybody make just one out in Boston any more? 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night against the Minnesota Twins, the Boston Red Sox became the first 
team to hit into two triple plays in one game. 
</P>
<P>
The double play was the thing Wednesday night when the Red Sox and Twins set 
another major league record by hitting into 10. The Red Sox hit into six to set 
an American League record. 
</P>
<P>
They broke the major league record of nine, set by the Angels and Red Sox in 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox, who won Tuesday, 1-0, also won this one, 5-4, to increase their 
lead in the AL East to 1 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox hit into double plays in each of the first four innings, with Kevin 
Romine hitting into two of them. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Tim Naehring started a four-run rally in the fifth inning with his first 
major league homer as the Red Sox tied the score, 4-4. Wade Boggs doubled in 
the seventh and scored the winning run on Carlos Quintana's single.

<P>
"We can keep on hitting into double and triple plays at a record clip, as long 
as we keep on winning," Romine said. DAN HAFNER

TRANSCRIPT EXCERPTS FROM STEINBRENNER'S HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excerpts from the transcript of New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner's 
hearing on July 5 and July 6 before Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent. The full 
transcript was released Wednesday by the commissioner's office after The 
National obtained a copy and ran excerpts in Wednesday's editions: 
</P>
<P>
On the matter of Steinbrenner's $40,000 payment to gambler Howard Spira: 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Let me turn to the $40,000 payment to Mr. Spira. . . . Your testimony 
is that you made this payment out of a mixture of motivations. Correct me if 
I'm wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Part of it was concern for your safety and for the safety of your family. Part 
of it was a hope that if you made the payment, this man would go his own way 
and never trouble you again. Part of it was out of a feeling of compassion for 
him -- his mother had cancer I think you testified -- a variety of factors. Am 
I correct that there was no single factor that led you to make this payment? 
That it was a mixture of these and any others which I may have overlooked? 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: Let me, if I could, to help you on this, let me rate them for 
you. Which one is the most. I'm not making any bones about the fact that this 
guy was a bad guy. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: We will stipulate that. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: And that he scared me and he really scared my children, 
particularly my one daughter. And I didn't know what to expect. Safety of my 
family had a lot to do with it. Security increased, as I said, around the 
clock, with my kids, they were frantic. They didn't understand why this stuff 
was happening. 
</P>
<P>
And when there was the matter about the Kelly-Weidler situation (former Yankee 
employees Pat Kelly, longtime Yankee Stadium manager, and David Weidler, former 
controller and chief operating officer) and the Lou Piniella situation. The 
Piniella family is very close to me. And I think the world of Lou Piniella. But 
when he (Spira) said that he threatened to sell information, as I recall he 
told me, on Lou Piniella and his sports betting habits, I didn't want to see 
baseball or Lou Piniella dragged through something the way it would have been 
sensationalized. We couldn't take it. It was a judgment on my part. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: But you believe, what I'm having trouble with is, let's focus on 
Spira. You dealt with this fellow for a long period of time. We developed 
information and you've confirmed that some of the things which Spira told you 
as they were investigated you found out were not true. Spira's a liar. Your 
materials make that clear. He may not lie on everything, but we all concede 
that he lies a lot. So here he comes and says, 'Lou Piniella. I have 
allegations about Lou Piniella.' And am I correct that this late in the game 
you believe that what he told you about Lou Piniella was true? 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: Commissioner, I don't know what to believe because as McNiff 
(Phil McNiff, head of security for Steinbrenner's American Shipbuilding Co.) 
told me, much of what he told me was corroborated by another witness and that 
there were polygraph tests taken and that these things were proven right. I 
don't know that an awful lot of what he told us was proven to be totally false. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: That's your testimony. In other words, you are saying to me that at 
the time you paid him, you believed that much -- you said not much of it was 
proven false. It's fair to say much, if not most, of what he told you was 
accurate? 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: And that a lot of things he told me were accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: And therefore that putting it in your terms, if he would sell 
information regarding Kelly and Weidler and Lou Piniella betting on sports, 
that those were items or factors which you would like not to come out, and 
therefore by paying him you believed that these statements would not be made 
public. That was part of the motivation? 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: All part of the ball of wax. You don't know what I went through. 
I just wanted to get him away. I wanted to get him the hell out of my life and 
my family's life. You don't know what it's like when you've got a guy out there 
calling and threatening to kill people in your family or other people's family. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: This is really the guts of it, from where I'm sitting. I'm putting 
myself in your shoes and I'm saying here is a guy whom I have not promised to 
give any money to, I have no commitments to him. I don't owe him a thing. I'm 
sitting in Tampa and I'm talking to my advisers, as I assume you were. Indeed 
you've testified that they told you . . . 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: Not do it. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Not do it? 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: And they are telling me not to do it. And I'm a smart fellow and have 
been around baseball. And here is a guy we know has been involved in some bad 
things. We know he's gambler or a former gambler. We know, to put it in your 
terms, that he may be involved in extorting money from me. I'm taking your 
definition now. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: Threatening me. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Yes. Why didn't you behave differently? Why didn't you call 
authorities? Why didn't you surround yourself with people who could protect 
you, both physically and legally? You might have called me. . . . My question 
to you, cutting through it all is, why didn't you do what I suggest? 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: No. 1, talk about physical protection. The little guy with a club 
in his hand. I mean they shot the president of the United States. They shot the 
Pope. With all the security that you could ever want around anybody, they still 
managed. If somebody wants to shoot you, they are going to shoot you. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: You testified, I believe -- again, I'm not putting words in your mouth 
-- that Kelly, Weidler and Piniella were people you wanted to protect. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: I didn't want him (Spira) talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: How did you think the payment protected them? 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: Maybe it was wrong. Maybe it was a judgment call. I felt that if 
this guy had this money, he would go away. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Did anybody tell you that it might be a problem within baseball? 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: They didn't say it was illegal to me. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: So you never thought as you were doing this that you would be here 
with anybody in baseball asking why you paid under these circumstances? . . . 
Did that occur to you? 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: No. It didn't. Maybe you are smarter than I am. You are a lawyer 
and I'm not. But it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Didn't it occur to your advisers? Weren't they saying to you, 'George, 
look, when this is all over and you pay him $40,000, it's going to look as if 
we brought this information about Winfield?' 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: Never mentioned by any adversary to me, Fay. And never -- and I 
didn't think about it. I had so many things going through my mind at that time 
about the things that I have told you, never occurred to me and nobody told me. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Did anybody say to you, 'George, suppose this guy takes the money and 
pays off gambling debts. You are now an owner in baseball financing a gambler? 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: Well, I didn't -- I never thought of that. Nobody ever mentioned 
that to me, Commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: I think you know how I feel about you and maybe I should have . . 
. come to you as a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Not as a friend. As commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: As commissioner. All right, as commissioner. Not as a friend, as 
commissioner. I knew that when I talked to the government that I had been lied 
to by the guy and maybe that's my stupidity in doing it. I could have kept 
paying him. I could have sent him somewhere and given him a job and do all that 
if it cost me $100,000 a year. That's an easy thing for me to do. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: You testified earlier when he told you about Piniella, you believed 
him because you felt his accuracy or his veracity had been pretty good. I'm 
having trouble with the difference between believing him . . . 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner: I never believed that Piniella was a gambler. I mean I saw him at 
horse races. I didn't know what this guy had or knew. I had no way of knowing. 
Some of what he told us was proven to be true. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't come to you. I don't know why I didn't come to you. I can't answer 
you. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: What I would like to do, I would like to be able to go up to the Cape 
with as much information as I can have and really sit and think hard about 
this. I tell you this is a matter of a soul. And it's hard. And I really find 
it anguishing. 
</P>
<P>
I have no interest in this process being other than resolved in what you and I 
in the perfect world would agree is in the interest of baseball. And I find it 
difficult and I am struggling with it.

TEDDY: STILL READY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Teddy Edwards and his saxophone arrived in Los Angeles at just the right time, 
1944: The city was flush with activity, and there was an almost never-ending 
club scene along Central Avenue south of downtown. Before long, the 20-year-old 
kid who had worked his way here from Jackson, Miss., via Detroit and Tampa had 
joined the band of trumpeter Howard McGhee, who persuaded him to trade his alto 
for the tenor. 
</P>
<P>
Before much longer, Edwards -- who plays Friday, July 20at the Hyatt Newporter 
in Newport Beach -- was working with such bop-minded musicians as Charlie 
Parker, Hampton Hawes and Wardell Gray. In 1947, he matched chops with Dexter 
Gordon on a Dial recording-sax battle called "The Duel." By 1954, he had 
replaced Sonny Stitt in the groundbreaking quintet of drummer Max Roach and 
trumpeter Clifford Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards still lives in Los Angeles but says the scene today lacks a focal point 
like the one it had in the late '40s and early '50s. "Los Angeles is so spread 
out now," he said recently from Portland, where he was appearing at the Hobbitt 
Club with his longtime associate, bassist Leroy Vinnegar. "You don't really 
have one location any more like in the Central Avenue days with clubs all up 
and down the street. That's one thing that's missing. I had a feeling that 
Melrose Avenue might turn into that, but it only developed so far." 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Edwards appears around the area with his Brass/String Ensemble, an 
ambitious mix of rhythm section and five each brass and string players 
(including a harpist), as well as in smaller combo settings. A frequent visitor 
to Europe, he's just back from the International Jazz Festival in Amsterdam 
where, in a tribute to the late Sarah Vaughan, he played with the likes of 
Clark Terry, Kenny Drew, Harry (Sweets) Edison and Ed Thigpen. He records 
infrequently, but his "Teddy's Ready," an up-tempo 1960 date that includes 
bassist Vinnegar, has been reissued by the Original Jazz Classics label. 
</P>
<P>
He promises that he'll perform such signature originals as "Good Gravy" and "No 
Name No. 1" in Newport where he'll be backed by keyboardist Ron Kalina, bassist 
Henry Franklin and drummer Roy McCurdy. He'll also feature singer Lisa 
Nobumoto, who's been studying voice with him for the last couple of years. 
"She's really grown and has a great, great future ahead of her," the instructor 
said of his student. "People are amazed at the progress she's made." 
</P>
<P>
Who: Teddy Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
When: Friday, July 20, 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Hyatt Newporter, 1107 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: The Hyatt is two blocks east of Coast Highway.

"The Third Man" (1949), directed by Carol Reed. 100 minutes. No rating. An 
American comes to post-war Vienna to discover that a friend has been murdered 
and winds up learning a little about love and loyalty -- too late, alas, to 
help himself. With Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, a script by Graham Greene that 
is a marvel of wit and intelligence, and some great zither music. M. FLAGG

Prices are based on average dinner costs for a party of two without wine.

AMERICAN 
</P>
<P>
* Burrell's Rib Cage, 305 N. Hesperian St., Santa Ana. (714) 835-9936. Open 
daily, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Also at 1701 E. Mc Fadden Ave., J, Santa Ana. (714) 
541-3073. Open Mondays through Thursdays 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and 
Saturdays till 11 p.m., Sundays till 9 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
 Wanna sample of what Magic Johnson and Richard Nixon say is the area's best 
barbecue? Come on down to Burrell's and see what the shouting is about. You'll 
eat from plastic boxes in a dark smoky room and you'll probably get sauce on 
your shirt. The good news is you won't care. Beef brisket is as soft and lean 
as a baby's cheek, and chopped pork shoulder is a symphony of textures. Save 
room for the especially terrific homemade sausage, crumbly and charred crisp. 
It's what a food critic lives for. 
</P>
<P>
CHINESE 
</P>
<P>
* China Muslim, 18331 E. Colima Road, Rowland Heights. (818) 810-2499. Open 
every day from 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
No one eats the rice at China Muslim, a restaurant just over the county line 
where the food of China's rugged western provinces is well represented. 
Instead, everybody eats the sze ma da bing, a giant sesame bread served 
steaming hot from the oven. Try such halal (conforming to Islamic dietary law) 
dishes as fragrant shredded tripe, shallot rubbed chicken and lamb with pan 
fried noodle. An exotic, unusual restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
INDIAN 
</P>
<P>
* Bukhara, 7954 Edinger Ave., Huntington Beach. (714) 842-3171. Open daily from 
11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 5 to 10:30 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Bukhara may have a slightly generic menu but the cooking is generally fresh and 
honest. The lunch buffet is incredibly generous at a mere $5.95 -- five 
vegetable dishes, hot naan bread, onion bhaji and two chicken dishes. Evenings, 
tandoori appetizers are the best bet, even if they do suffer from an excess of 
food coloring. Sauced dishes are good too, even if they are all prepared with 
the same spices. Leave room for the kulfi ice cream, made from boiled milk and 
crushed nuts. It's great. 
</P>
<P>
MEXICAN 
</P>
<P>
* Colima, 130 N. Fairview, Santa Ana. (714) 836-1254. Open seven days a week, 
7:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
Colima is your basic storefront Mexican restaurant but what comes out of the 
kitchen is far from ordinary. A woman named Lupe oversees the cooking and makes 
wonderful, hand-made tortillas daily. Her sons assist. Such fresh seafoods as 
snapper, shrimp, octopus, perch and catfish are the specialties, prepared in a 
variety of styles. Don't miss the rompope, egg nog with a kick like a crazed 
burro. 
</P>
<P>
THAI 
</P>
<P>
* Thainakorn, 24401 Ridge Route, Laguna Hills. (714) 586-0596. Open daily 
except Mondays from 10:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., Fridays through Sundays till 11 
p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Thainakorn of Laguna Hills is a surburban dinner house serving a smoothed over 
version of fare from northeast Thailand, normally one of the world's hottest 
cuisines. Dine on standby Thai such as pat Thai noodles and sour shrimp soup 
or, better yet, specialties from the blackboard like crispy, exotically spiced 
Thai sausage, Chinese watercress with fermented soy, or wild boar in red curry 
paste. But leave the fire extinguisher at home.

<P>
* The Renaissance Cafe at 234 Forest Ave. in Laguna Beach offers "tastes of 
things" daily from 7 a.m. to midnight, according to Charles See, who is a 
partner in the operation with Darrel Anderson, a grandson of Walter Knott. 
Mornings, they serve fresh fruit, oatmeal and one-egg omelets. 
</P>
<P>
From 11:30 on, the "things" include soup, brie with fruit, calamari tacos (!), 
pasta and such grilled dishes as fish and orange pepper chicken. Live 
entertainment Sunday afternoons from 2 to 6 varies from light jazz to dulcimer 
music. (714) 497-5282. 
</P>
<P>
* Cafe Zoolu has, along with the usual tables, an exhibition kitchen surrounded 
by a counter with nine (comfortable) seats. The place, at 860 Glenneyre St. in 
Laguna, used to be an antique shop until chef-owner Lonnie Painter and his 
artist wife Jeri Kissler came along. The menu reflects Painter's experiences at 
Hotel Laguna and at Trees in Corona del Mar: You'll find fresh fish (often 
served with salsas), meat loaf and pastas priced from $8 to $14. Kissler's 
paintings grace the walls. And there's live entertainment. (714) 494-6825. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, down the street: 
</P>
<P>
Chef Rosann Ruiz has left Sorrento Grill at 370 Glenneyre St. But the 
restaurant filled the gap quickly with Italian-trained Duilio Valenti, who has 
worked at Rex Il Ristorante in Los Angeles and Villa d'Este in San Diego. Ruiz 
is freelancing now for the Robert Mondavi Food and Wine Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Here 'n' There: LaFayette, a French restaurant at 12532 Garden Grove Blvd. in 
Garden Grove, is now open Sunday nights, offering complete dinners at prices 
from $16 to $27. (714) 537-5011. BEVERLY BUSH SMITH

MAX JACOBSON: HEAVY ON THE FRENCH, HOLD THE SALT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At Napoleon, a new French restaurant in Dana Point, the maitre d's name is 
Alfred Bonaparte. That is what I call a tough act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Bonaparte is a colorful fellow who loves to bend your ear about the many places 
he has lived, but he is not actually related to the late emperor. He's not even 
French; he comes from Goa, a former Portuguese colony on India's western coast. 
As for the family name, it's one his father patriotically took after serving in 
the French army. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's owner is French, though. Jean-Paul Gourgues was reared in 
Bordeaux and operated a restaurant in Montreal for some years. I'd guess he 
originally planned to limit his menu at Napoleon to traditional French cuisine 
but some good instinct told him to add a spate of spa and bistro dishes to 
reach a broader clientele. 
</P>
<P>
It's not going to be easy. Dana Point, brimming though it is with young 
professionals and urban escapees, is still a beachfront community where most of 
the restaurants are not far from the water. A formal, landlocked French dining 
room like this one is just not what most people expect in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
Well, they've got one now. When he took over the premises formerly known as 
JJ's Bistro, Gourgues totally renovated the place in French style. It's now a 
regal blue room full of mirrors and chandeliers where you sit on faux 
provincial chairs with round turquoise cushions and wicker backs. 
</P>
<P>
Gourgues keeps candles flickering to maintain an early 19th-Century mood 
(though the music is often anachronistic: sometimes Debussy, sometimes '30s 
swing) and has added framed prints of the emperor himself along with several 
scenes of battles royal. It's exactly the sort of room you'd expect to find in 
a medium-size French city, the kind of place you'd visit after a leisurely 
drive through the French countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Sit in one of the dark, romantic corner tables or, if possible, in the 
so-called gazebo room -- really a boxed-in little room for romantic trysts -- 
and follow two simple rules: Ask that dishes be slightly undercooked and tell 
them to go easy on the salt (chef Gilberto Mercado, formerly of Perino's in Los 
Angeles, salts to excess when left to his own devices). Do this and you may eat 
very well here. 
</P>
<P>
The hors d'oeuvres don't show a lot of originality but most are solidly 
prepared. The escargots de Bourgogne are particularly delightful, one of the 
best versions I've had in a long time. Mercado prepares them in a tarragon 
butter sauce and serves them in braised mushroom caps. I also liked the pate 
maison, a grainy country-style pate served with a large heap of aspic and some 
crunchy little cornichon pickles. 
</P>
<P>
The oysters made me feel cheated, though. As I bit into one of my huitres 
sautees au fenouil -- oysters supposedly sauteed in fennel butter -- I 
discovered they had been breaded and deep fried. That rendered them ludicrously 
heavy for the thick cream sauce, virtually inedible. 
</P>
<P>
Soups and salads are not a strong point here (the vichyssoise, made in advance, 
was so salty that neither I nor anyone else at the table would eat it) but 
there are a few bright spots. Soupe a l'oignon gratinee was served in a lovely 
porcelain terrine with a perfect crown of melted Gruyere cheese; the stock 
tasted rich and beefy. Salads have a tendency to be on the sweet side -- the 
spinach salad would have been fine with just a bit less sugar -- but the potent 
Caesar is well mixed and very heavy on the anchovies. 
</P>
<P>
There is quite a large selection of fresh fish and meat entrees; make sure to 
ask what is fresh that day. Langoustines Imperatrice, made with imported 
scampi, unquestionably is the restaurant's star dish. Like tiny slim-line 
lobsters, the scampi float in a subtle beurre blanc, melt in the mouth like 
butter and have a lingering taste of delicious sweetness. Poached salmon, from 
the menu category entitled "Les Dietetiques," was nearly as pleasing and as 
light as a feather. The salmon came soft and flaky, attractively accompanied 
with steamed asparagus, endive and Mercado's signature broiled tomato with 
spiced bread crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure that things are to be cooked as the menu leads you to believe. Another 
spa dish, paillarde de poulet, was supposed to be chicken breast poached with 
fresh herbs. What came from the kitchen was a butterflied chicken breast 
grilled nearly to death. In general go with the simple dishes here: filet 
mignon, grilled Dover sole, perhaps a rack of lamb. The sauce bigarade on the 
orange duck was sweet enough to pour on ice cream and the ponderous cream sauce 
on a dish called pheasant grand veneur seemed as thick as vanilla pudding. 
</P>
<P>
The lunch time bistro menu lists many simple dishes, straightforward and 
enticing. Mousse de truite Perigueux is trout mousse in a Madeira truffle 
sauce. In feuillete d'oeufs mollets, poached eggs are served in little pastry 
shells. Omelet Brayaude is like a potato frittata with a twist, the addition of 
ham and chopped walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Gourgues personally prepares the crepes Suzette and cherries jubilee at the 
table, swirling them in a flaming pan. I'd stick to simpler desserts, though: a 
creamy homemade cheesecake, or an artistic fresh fruit salad with several kinds 
of berries. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and don't try getting funny with the maitre d'. No, Napoleons are not on 
the dessert menu. 
</P>
<P>
Napoleon is moderately expensive. Lunch items are $6 to $12.50. At dinner, hors 
d'oeuvres, soups and salads are $2.75 to $6.75. Main dishes are $12.50 to 
$18.50. Sunday brunch is $14.50.

NIXON PROVES HE CAN GO HOME AGAIN

Richard M. Nixon blended past and present Wednesday, viewing the simple wooden 
house where he was born and strolling through the next-door presidential 
library to be dedicated today at a triumphal gathering of Presidents, friends 
and family. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day marked by an evening party of Nixon Administration alumni and a 
lunch for library contributors, a reunion of men and women like Nixon friend 
Bebe Rebozo and presidential secretary Rose Mary Woods; former Treasury 
Secretary William E. Simon and the Rev. Billy Graham; former Secretary of State 
Alexander M. Haig and former press secretary Ron Ziegler. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon peeked into the home his father built from a kit, and then proceeded with 
his wife, Pat, daughter Julie and her husband, David Eisenhower, to the 
$21-million, Spanish-style building that will be opened to the public Friday. 
There they entered the library auditorium and he spoke to more than 300 people 
who had converged from across the country to salute him. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the standing-room-only audience were former White House workers and 
members of the February Group, an organization of Nixon Administration alumni 
that formed months after their leader was forced by the Watergate break-in and 
cover-up to resign the presidency on Aug. 9, 1974. Others were library 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
After an eight-minute standing ovation, Nixon started to talk, only to be 
interrupted by a shout of "Welcome Home, Mr. President!" 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was closed to the press, but those inside said Nixon told them, 
"You are very special, very special." He said he and Pat knew in 1946, during 
his first political campaign for Congress, that the volunteers working for him 
were vital and that to see so many people from the old days made him feel like 
he was looking at his roots. 
</P>
<P>
He said his library "belongs to all Americans" regardless of ideology or 
politics, and that he hoped it would inspire young people with the lesson that 
they can rise from humble beginnings to the highest office in the land. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon reminisced about his campaigns of 40 years ago, when after being a 
congressman from Whittier he won a U.S. Senate seat and then became Dwight D. 
Eisenhower's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
He told the crowd that Julie and David Eisenhower's children were at Disneyland 
and his other daughter, Tricia, her husband and their son flew to California 
with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Bush flew into El Toro Marine Corps Air Station on Wednesday afternoon, saying 
he was "very pleased to be going to this dedication of this library." After 
spending the night at the Anaheim Hilton, this morning he is scheduled to host 
a California Republican Party fund-raising breakfast before presiding at the 
open-air dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Nixon will join the other two living Republican ex-Presidents, Gerald 
R. Ford and Ronald Reagan, for the ceremony and later for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion will mark the first gathering of four former Presidents since the 
1981 White House gathering of Reagan, Ford, Nixon and Jimmy Carter en route to 
the funeral of slain Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. Carter declined an 
invitation to attend the library opening. 
</P>
<P>
Today's ceremonies are open to the public, and police said a crowd of about 
20,000 is expected for the dedication of the nation's 10th presidential 
library, the first one in California and the first to be built and operated 
entirely with private money. The next library will be Reagan's, which is 
scheduled to open in 1991 in Simi Valley. Tonight Nixon will be honored at a 
dinner at the Century Plaza Hotel in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
As the Nixons emerged from their car Wednesday to the cheers of about 50 
people, the only man to resign the presidency waved to the crowd and mouthed 
the word "tomorrow" at people shouting questions at him from a roped-off area 
for spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Nixon, 78 years old and appearing frail in a white and black silk dress, 
accepted a bouquet of yellow roses from three Brownie Scouts and kissed each 
one on the forehead. Her husband, 77, in a dark suit and white shirt, bent over 
and shook hands with them before entering the building. 
</P>
<P>
For Pat Nixon, today's dedication will be a rare public appearance. While her 
husband has spent much of the last decade removing the tarnish from his 
reputation, writing books, visiting foreign countries and meeting world 
leaders, Pat has spent her time in private. Friends say she is devoted to her 
children and grandchildren and indulges her love for gardening. 
</P>
<P>
Helene Drown of Rolling Hills Estates, who has known Thelma (Pat) Nixon since 
they were both schoolteachers in Whittier, said her longtime friend is "just 
thrilled to pieces about" the library dedication, viewing it as "a great 
tribute to her husband." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Nixon met for an hour in Century City with Reagan, who later said 
in an interview that historians should rethink their view of Nixon and place 
greater emphasis on the former President's foreign policy record. Much 
criticism of Nixon, Reagan said, "was based on nothing at all." 
</P>
<P>
But Henry A. Kissinger, Nixon's secretary of state at the time of his 
resignation, disputed that statement Wednesday, saying that while his former 
boss deserves enormous credit for his Administration's foreign policy 
successes, Nixon and his staff also blundered badly in handling the Watergate 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there were definite, huge errors," Kissinger said during a 40-minute 
interview at a Beverly Hills hotel. "I have always believed that he was 
punished much too severely . . . but I think there were huge mistakes made." 
</P>
<P>
With some scholars questioning the Nixon library's value as a research 
institution, Kissinger also called on the former President to compile a 
complete set of presidential papers and administer them according to National 
Archives access policies. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon library Executive Director Hugh Hewitt had said that certain people would 
likely be excluded from the library -- a statement he later retracted -- and 
Kissinger suggested that Nixon issue a statement announcing his intention to 
have the library administered identically to other presidential libraries. 
</P>
<P>
While the museum, with its exhibits on Nixon's career, opens Friday, the 
library portion, of more interest to scholars, is not expected to open until 
next year. Hewitt said the Watergate exhibits in the museum still were not 
ready and might not be finished Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service set up a booth outside the building for a special library 
postmark. Across the street, facing the building, was a hand-lettered sign: 
"Watch out, George. He's tan, rested and ready. Nixon 1992." 
</P>
<P>
Hours before the Nixons visited the library, Simon, who served as treasury 
secretary under Nixon and one of the main money-raisers for the facility, 
hosted a luncheon at the building for about 50 longtime Nixon supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were Rebozo, one of Nixon's closest friends; Max Fisher, an 
oil magnate and Nixon pal; and Carl Karcher, founder of Orange County-based 
Carl's Jr. fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is going to be a great tribute to the Nixon family, and it will 
be a great asset for Orange County," Karcher said as he entered the luncheon. 
"I think as time goes on Nixon will go down as one of the outstanding 
Presidents in history." 
</P>
<P>
Before the gathering of the February Group, former Nixon speechwriter Patrick 
J. Buchanan said the meeting "will probably be the real first and last conclave 
of those who have been associated with Richard Nixon . . . since his second 
inaugural" in 1973, 19 months before he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
The library entrance was the scene of some reunions Wednesday, with Haig 
striding across the lawn when he spotted Simon and greeting him, "Hello, Uncle 
Bill." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters about the library, Haig said young people will especially 
benefit from studying Nixon, who he said has a "steel-like character that has 
carried him through recovery after recovery, whether it's his physical health 
or his political health." 
</P>
<P>
Simon, who was one of the first to be called by Nixon in 1984 to help resume 
the library project, described his first tour of the facility Wednesday as 
"breathtaking." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see anybody who was with Nixon in the White House who didn't come out 
without tears in his eyes after looking at some of the pictures and the 
memorabilia," he said. "It's incredible, it's a very warm, wonderful affair." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Khachigian of San Clemente, who started his presidential speech-writing 
career in Nixon's White House, said the former President was "very jovial and 
upbeat" when he saw him Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Khachigian said Nixon was interested in the latest assessments of the 
California governor's race, noting that the Republican candidate, U.S. Sen. 
Pete Wilson, worked on Nixon's campaign for California governor in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nixon campaigns were a training ground for thousands of operatives who 
made their way up the ladder like Pete Wilson," Khachigian said. As a result, 
he said, the reunion of Nixon supporters and staff prompted by the library 
dedication was extraordinarily large and included American political leaders 
reaching back nearly half a century. 
</P>
<P>
"They say (Vice President) Dan Quayle is young; Nixon was 39 when he was vice 
president," Khachigian noted. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people here who haven't seen each other for . . . years all greeting 
each other with great warmth," he said. "Politics uniquely brings people 
together but his time was even more unique because we went through so much 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the glue that held us all together." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Garment, White House personal counsel to Nixon, called Watergate a 
"kidney stone" that "worked its way out of everybody's system a long time ago. 
. . . You won't find this group wallowing in Watergate." 
</P>
<P>
Woods, longtime personal secretary to Nixon, said, "There's so much else to 
talk about, so many great accomplishments -- why dwell on it?" 
</P>
<P>
Graham, a longtime friend and frequent golfing buddy of Nixon's, said the 
library dedication at which he will give the invocation will be the "pinnacle" 
of Nixon's career. The clergyman said it will symbolize the American public's 
forgiveness.

MANDELA PROMISES NEW TALKS WITH DE KLERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nelson Mandela, concluding a six-week, 14-country tour of North America, Europe 
and Africa, returned home Wednesday on his 72nd birthday, promising to meet 
with President Frederik W. de Klerk within days to discuss a new round of peace 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
"We with the African National Congress are very keen" to clear the remaining 
obstacles to formal negotiations, Mandela told an airport news conference. 
</P>
<P>
ANC leaders hailed Mandela's tour as a success, pointing out that the ANC 
obtained promises from many governments not to relax economic sanctions against 
Pretoria and was able to raise millions of dollars for its coffers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the difficulties Mandela still faces at home was highlighted hours 
before his return when gunmen ambushed a bus and forced it off the road in 
Natal province, killing at least 25 people and injuring dozens of others. The 
police said the incident followed an outbreak of political violence the night 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Natal has been the scene of repeated clashes between feuding supporters of the 
ANC and the Inkatha movement of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi. More 
than 3,000 people have died in the internecine fighting in the past three 
years, and the war has heightened in the months since February, when Mandela 
was released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
The inability of the warring black factions to end the violence in Natal 
threatens South Africa's fledgling peace process. Mandela has blamed the 
apartheid system for creating the climate for feuding in Natal, and he has 
called on the government to put a stop to it. The government contends that the 
ANC's refusal to abandon its armed struggle has exacerbated the problems in 
Natal. 
</P>
<P>
Another threat to peace is the rise of right-wing violence and threats against 
both Mandela and De Klerk. The police say a series of bomb blasts in recent 
days, which have killed three people, may have been carried out by militant 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, an ANC regional office in Johannesburg received an anonymous 
letter threatening "a few surprises . . . on your leader's aeroplane and at the 
airport." It threatened to destroy the ANC and suggested that "innocent people 
(could) become the targets." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela arrived safely in Johannesburg from Maputo, Mozambique, after changing 
aircraft because of what the ANC described as a mechanical problem. About 250 
heavily armed police officers were stationed at the airport here, and several 
hundred supporters gathered outside to welcome him. 
</P>
<P>
ANC leaders inside the terminal building sang "Happy Birthday." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a boy of 36," Mandela said. The ANC leader, who was hospitalized 
briefly in Nairobi last week for a mild case of pneumonia, appeared rested and 
alert. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he wants for his birthday, Mandela responded, "The present I would 
like is votes for all."

BAGUIO, Philippines 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rescue crews and relief supplies began to trickle into this stricken resort and 
university city Wednesday as hope faded for hundreds of people believed trapped 
under collapsed buildings as a result of Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Medical officials warned of possible epidemics as tens of thousands of 
residents huddled for a third day in tattered tents and makeshift shelters in 
parks and streets. Drenched by daily rains, many complained that they had no 
food, water or medicine. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, doctors working under umbrellas and sheets of plastic had treated 
nearly 800 of the injured in muddy outdoor areas. The city's three hospitals 
were all damaged and without power. Aftershocks continued throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
A grim silence lay across Baguio, a mountain city of 200,000 people, as 
grief-stricken families stood and stared while rescue teams searched, mostly in 
vain, for survivors in the rubble of two hotels, the Hyatt Terraces and the 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Without electric power, the delicate work stopped as daylight faded. Almost no 
rescue operations were evident at the 20 other hotels and at schools, office 
buildings and factories brought down by the quake. Hundreds of homes also were 
damaged or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. J. M. Aquias of the Philippine army, who is directing relief 
operations, confirmed 186 deaths in the Baguio area. He estimated that the toll 
may reach 400 to 600, but others put it even higher. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Robert Plunkett, commander of Camp John Hay, a U.S. military 
recreation facility that has become a staging area for relief operations, said: 
"I personally believe it's going to be in the thousands, but it's going to be 
weeks before we know." Plunkett said about 1,500 Americans live in Baguio. 
</P>
<P>
Civil defense officials reported 315 dead and 86,000 homeless across Luzon 
Island as a result of the quake, which was measured at a magnitude of 7.7. 
President Corazon Aquino, who flew into Baguio by helicopter Wednesday to 
inspect the damage, ordered area schools closed for a month and declared a 
state of emergency throughout central Luzon. 
</P>
<P>
In Cabanatuan, near the quake's epicenter, workers began using heavy cranes 
after hope died for up to 30 students still buried in a six-story college 
building. Sixty-two students and teachers are known to have died in the 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit was Baguio, about 110 miles north of Manila, and the surrounding 
province of Benguet. The city's airport was closed, and landslides blocked all 
access roads. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine officials said they hoped to clear a coastal road by early today. 
Ambulances and trucks with food, water and relief equipment waited at San 
Fernando while crews used bulldozers and dynamite to clear the debris. 
</P>
<P>
Until the bulldozers arrive, rescuers had little but their hands and simple 
tools to search for survivors. A crane was at work at the Hyatt Terraces, but 
it was dwarfed by the 12 giant concrete terraces, which had toppled sideways 
and then sandwiched together. 
</P>
<P>
One casino worker was pulled out bloody but conscious early Wednesday. Heinrich 
Maulbecker, the hotel's general manager, said 80 people, including 30 tourists, 
are still unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, volunteers cooked huge vats of rice under a parachute rigged as a 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
A series of aftershocks rocked the area about noon Wednesday, sending rescuers 
scurrying. Later, all rescue work was stopped for several hours because of a 
report that another quake was imminent. None occurred. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Hyatt survivors, Ed Feist, an Australian, said he was holding a 
meeting in a second-floor conference room when the quake hit. He and 11 
associates managed to get out a window. Two others disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"It was horrible, horrible," he said. "I told everyone to be calm. But the 
shaking wouldn't stop. Then we felt everything cave in. And we just dropped two 
floors." 
</P>
<P>
Three other people were rescued bruised but alive from the five-story Hotel 
Nevada, which twisted and split before it crumbled. Local miners, assisted by 
U.S. military engineers, burrowed into the debris after hearing voices. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Nevada, the hotel's owner, said about half of the 75 guests are still 
unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 170 people were feared dead in the city's Export Processing Zone, where a 
giant three-story factory building collapsed and caught fire Tuesday afternoon. 
The building was still smoldering Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in voice contact with several people until the fire," said Michael 
Raeuber, a German who heads one of the six companies that used the building. 
"Now, of course, there's nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Farolan, the company's director, said 20 are known dead and up to 150 are 
believed still inside. He said none could have survived the chemical fire. 
</P>
<P>
"We need heavy equipment to pry the concrete floors apart," he said. "There's 
nothing we can do until the equipment comes up. And it can't come until the 
road is cleared." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. military helicopters landed on a fairway at Camp John Hay's 
golf course, carrying body bags, hospital supplies and about 250 engineers, 
technicians, doctors and other personnel. 
</P>
<P>
A medical evacuation center with a dozen beds was set up. Doctors there sent 
more than 30 of the most seriously injured to a hospital at Clark Air Base. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones who are trapped are running out of time," said Capt. Kim Lowe, head 
of the trauma unit. "After 72 hours, they get dehydrated and start to die. 
We're fast approaching that point." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy announced that a special 21-member disaster relief team had 
arrived from Washington with four dogs and power saws, rope, medical supplies 
and other gear. Other supplies were airlifted in from Guam. 
</P>
<P>
Japan sent medical and rescue teams and $300,000 worth of relief supplies. 
Canada, Thailand, Israel, England and at least eight other countries also 
offered assistance.

BAKER OFFERS U.S. TECHNICAL AID TO KREMLIN

Secretary of State James A. Baker III offered Wednesday to provide American 
technical assistance to help the Soviet Union rebuild its crumbling system for 
transporting and distributing goods. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said Baker gave Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze a paper outlining possible U.S. aid to Soviet economic 
reform during a 2 1/2-hour meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has ruled out costly financial aid to Moscow, but it 
has long been ready to give the Soviet Union the benefit of its technical 
expertise. President Bush made such an offer to Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev during their summit meeting last year in Malta. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department official said the paper that Baker gave Shevardnadze on 
Wednesday spelled out the details of the Bush offer. In addition to 
transportation, the report suggested U.S. help in establishing a Soviet banking 
system and in improving its housing stock. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze cut short their Paris meeting to permit the Soviet 
foreign minister to keep an appointment with French President Francois 
Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he and Shevardnadze will resume their dialogue Aug. 1 in the Soviet 
city of Irkutsk.

'THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT' STILL CAST THEIR GLOW ON PRESIDENT'S APPROACH 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly before his inauguration, President-elect George Bush told television 
interviewer Barbara Walters that, in a time of tight financial resources, "I 
won't be able to match the highest bidder on federal funds for education, or 
federal funds for drug rehabilitation, or federal funds for the homeless, 
whatever it is. 
</P>
<P>
"But does that mean I don't care?" Bush went on. "No. It doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
In 18 months as President, Bush has kept steadfastly to that theme and image: 
He is a caring President hamstrung by his budget. For the most part, he has 
delivered a moderate message outlining the dimensions of many of the problems 
generated by the crisis of poverty. But his words have not matched federal 
action. 
</P>
<P>
There have been some exceptions. He has increased the federal budget 
substantially in the war on drugs, for example, and he has proposed a 
significant increase in the funding of the popular Head Start program. But his 
critics insist that his drug funds are misdirected -- more for the hunt of 
criminals than the treatment of addicts -- and that his Head Start increase, 
though welcome, is far less than needed. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has recognized the existence of a gap between what is needed and what his 
government will spend but has contended that this gap can be filled by private 
Americans who offer their time and money to the needy -- the "thousand points 
of light" of his electoral campaign. The President describes his role as mainly 
one of encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply moved by the plight of those who lack the skills that most of us 
. . . simply take for granted," he told the National Federation of Republican 
Women in Baltimore last October. "And rest assured, we're going to continue to 
work with you, those of you out there on the cutting edge, to promote literacy 
skills." 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the President's views about poverty and homelessness in 
America: 
</P>
<P>
 "My problem is that the best answer to poverty is a job, and the best way you 
have a job is to have a strong economy. And so you have to get the deficit 
down, and that's where, under the law, I'm required to do it. So I'll keep 
fighting for that." 
</P>
<P>
 -- In reply to questions at John F. Kennedy High School, Denver, Dec. 8, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The best poverty program is a job in the private sector, where a family can 
hold their heads up high with a certain dignity. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When these mandated benefits (bills) come down here, they have good titles on 
them, they have things we're concerned about: parental leave or child care, 
whatever it is. And I am sympathetic with many of the objectives. But as I 
weigh them, I have a responsibility to say what kind of an effect are they 
going to have on this best antidote to poverty and that's a job. And so, we've 
got to resist some of the call for these good things that have good titles if 
they undermine the fundamental thing, which is our ability to create jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Talk with visitors to the White House, April 4, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is there is no better housing policy than a growing economy. And 
we've got one, one that provides jobs and wages and opportunities for 
advancement, long-term interest rates that open ownership opportunities to 
hundreds of thousands of first-time home-buyers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"No child in America should have to grow up in the streets, and every family in 
America should have a roof over its head. We've got to do better. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But the real answer for the homeless, those with mental problems or dependent 
on drugs or alcohol, is shelter plus care. Shelter, supplemented by the 
necessary support services to get these people the help they need to live in 
dignity. And that means a partnership, a combined federal, state and local 
effort to supply the funding and other resources that constitute a 
comprehensive solution for the hard-core homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speech to the National Assn. of Realtors, Nov. 10, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Speaking of tenants in public housing, they deserve something else: a safe 
place to raise their children and live their lives. And so, I ordered an 
additional $50 million to HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development) the 
other day to evict the drug dealers from public housing. Let's give these kids 
a fighting chance." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remarks to visitors at the White House, Sept. 8, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing we can't afford is to fall behind the competition when it comes to 
training the educated work force that future challenges will require." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speech to the National Assn. of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, 
Nov. 21, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that we spend more per capita than many of our toughest 
competitors. And as a nation, we devote more than $300 billion a year to 
educating our children. And that's not stingy; it's staggering. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We can't have a world-class economy with second-class schools." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remarks at annual meeting of the Business Roundtable, June 5, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We must revitalize our schools so that a solid education is once again the 
birthright of every American kid. And to make this kind of progress will 
require more than a government program or another grant initiative. Republicans 
believe that it will take the active involvement of parents and students and 
teachers and business and local government and churches, yes, and our schools. 
And this is what we mean by a "thousand points of light." As powerful and 
resourceful as government is, government alone cannot come close to overcoming 
these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remarks at formal White House dinner, June 14, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an unease in the health-care community that for all this nation's 
wealth, for all the money put into the system, American medicine still faces 
unprecedented problems: medical malpractice, uninsured families, an aging 
population, cancer, heart disease, AIDS, drug addiction, Alzheimer's, mental 
illness. The price tag is staggering. And today, over 11% of our gross national 
product goes to health care. And we rank No. 1 in the world in per capita 
health-care expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"And yet, we do remain behind other industrialized countries in life 
expectancy. And in the developed world we rank 22nd in infant mortality rates 
-- 22nd. Clearly we have our work cut out for us. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This Administration is committed to health-care policies that improve 
health-care quality while trying to restrain the costs." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speech at Johns Hopkins University graduation ceremony, Baltimore, Feb. 22, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government is not going to solve the (drug) treatment problem by 
itself. Yes, I think the money will be forthcoming. And there won't be enough 
of it to solve the treatment problem in every community in the country. And so, 
what does that leave you? It leaves you local government, state government and 
involvement of citizens in the lives of others." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Luncheon with members of regional news media, Sept. 15, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not going to be won by the federal government, this battle. The 
federal government has a key role to play, and I am trying to see that we play 
it by putting forward and then implementing a national drug strategy. But 
please understand I have not changed my conviction that the answer will lie at 
the local and the state level as we go forward with our national strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Meeting with foreign ambassadors and state and local leaders, Sept. 6, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"If you sell drugs, you will be caught. And when you're caught, you will be 
prosecuted. And once you're convicted, you will do time. Caught. Prosecuted. 
Punished." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Address to the nation, Sept. 5, 1989.

A bitterly contested GOP primary election for the Illinois Legislature that 
became a battleground in the fight over abortion was decided Wednesday by the 
toss of a coin. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Mulligan was declared the winner over Penny Pullen, an outspoken 
abortion foe who had held her suburban Chicago seat 14 years. Unofficial 
returns showed she lost by about a dozen votes in the primary. A court declared 
a tie after Pullen demanded a recount. Her lawyer promised an appeal of the 
coin toss decision.

TWO TOWNS THAT WON'T BE CELEBRATING TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
SAN CLEMENTE: THE LIBRARY WAS ALMOST BUILT HERE OVERLOOKING THE PACIFIC, BUT A 
DEADLINE WAS MISSED BY TWO WEEKS.

SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just for a minute, forget Yorba Linda. Picture instead the Nixon presidential 
library perched on the Marblehead Bluffs in San Clemente with a perfect view of 
the Pacific Ocean mere yards away. 
</P>
<P>
That picture, however, never left the blueprints. Amid a controversy that 
divided this beach community three years ago, Nixon and his advisers decided to 
locate the library next to the Yorba Linda house where he was born, rather than 
adjacent to the site of his seaside Western White House. 
</P>
<P>
Just as critics are divided about the former President's place in history, so 
too are residents and community leaders about whether the library should have 
been located in their city. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still no clear-cut opinion about whether the library should have been 
here," said San Clemente City Manager Michael W. Parness, referring to the 
community. "Some people are still upset that it is not here. But others don't 
care much about the density and traffic it might have brought." 
</P>
<P>
For a few years, however, community leaders flirted with the idea of having the 
library in their city. The creation of the Western White House had placed the 
small town on the political map, and civic leaders thought that the Nixon 
library would spur tourism and commercial activity. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon had chosen the Marblehead Bluffs as the site for the library in 1983 
after his friend, Irvine developer John Lusk, donated 17 acres of land for the 
project. There was only one catch: The library project was attached to a 
controversial 253-acre residential and commercial development proposed by the 
Lusk Co. of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
City officials delayed their approval of the development. In 1987, Nixon issued 
an ultimatum to San Clemente officials: approve the entire project within a 
month or lose it. 
</P>
<P>
The city's approval came two weeks after Nixon's ultimatum expired, but by then 
the former President had already decided to locate the library next to his 
birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
The move triggered talk of a recall campaign that never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
Many San Clemente residents believed, however, that the delay in the approval 
of the project had nothing to do with Nixon's decision to place the library in 
Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the city's approval, the project still faced a six-month-to-one-year 
approval process with the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"When Yorba Linda got the library, I was very upset. I felt like going up there 
and telling them off," said Councilman Thomas Lorch, who was a major advocate 
for the project. "Then I realized that Nixon's heart was there, and it was 
really his preference of the two." 
</P>
<P>
Some San Clemente residents thought the proposed site for the library would 
have been ideal. Many say that having the library on the 75-foot-high 
Marblehead Bluffs -- a scenic, milelong stretch of sandstone cliffs with a 
180-degree view of the ocean -- would have combined a perfect vacation with an 
educational experience. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Smith, general manager of the San Clemente Inn, said there were no doubts 
about the library being a success. The hotel's display of Nixon memorabilia in 
its "Bit of History" museum drew crowds of enthusiastic Nixon fans, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents, however, feel no loss that the museum ended up in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Realtor Bob Farnell, who would have been Nixon's next-door neighbor had the 
library been located in San Clemente, is thankful that it wasn't built here. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy's a crook," Farnell said. "And think about the problems we've been 
spared. When he was President and came on weekends, the Secret Service and the 
Coast Guard took over the beach. Do you know what it's like seeing six-foot 
tubular waves and you have to stay out of it because one man is in town." 
</P>
<P>
The saga involving the Marblehead Bluffs has, however, not ended. Last month, 
Lusk Co. officials unveiled a plan to build a resort hotel complex, 500 homes 
and an 18-hole golf course on the site. City officials say the new proposal is 
likely to meet with the council's approval. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Mayor Candace Haggard said that if she had her way, the Nixon 
library would have been on Marblehead. Haggard is an Orange County librarian, 
and she recalls shaking Nixon's hand at a gathering several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The library would have been good for the city," Haggard said.

TWO TOWNS THAT WON'T BE CELEBRATING TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
WHITTIER: CITY THAT LAUNCHED NIXON'S POLITICAL CAREER MISSED THREE 
OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY.

<P>
Nestled in the Whittier Hills sits a ridge-top plateau of pristine, prime real 
estate with a view of the Pacific on a clear day. The city of Whittier first 
sought to make this the home of a Nixon library more than two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
And again seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And four more years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But today, the champagne toasting the dedication of the $21-million library 
flows in Yorba Linda, Nixon's birthplace and now-chosen resting place for the 
former President's selected archives. 
</P>
<P>
"We were terribly shocked," former Whittier Mayor Victor Lopez said recently of 
Nixon's decision to locate his private library elsewhere. "It would have been a 
boost to Whittier, Whittier College and the whole thing. We were terribly 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Chandler, another of the city's former mayors, added: "We always figured 
that Whittier was his home." 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to understand Whittier's claim to the 37th President. Although 
Richard M. Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, it was in Whittier that he spent his 
high school and college years. He met his wife in Whittier and practiced law 
here. And Whittier Republicans helped him start his political career, a 
successful bid to unseat Democratic incumbent Jerry Voorhis in a congressional 
district that encompassed the city and nearby communities. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon entered Whittier as a child; he left it as a figure in national politics. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we had a complete inside track historically," Chandler said, "with 
Whittier representing most of his life. It wasn't to be." 
</P>
<P>
Whittier's first effort to claim the library began shortly after Nixon's 1968 
presidential triumph over Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. Whittier College 
helped to lead the bid for the library, which enjoyed strong community support. 
</P>
<P>
"His presidency was important at the time to the college," said Joseph 
Dmohowski, special collections librarian at Whittier College. "It attracted a 
lot of students to the college." 
</P>
<P>
The city presented the then-President with a handsome, oversize, leather-bound 
and cloth-lined tome titled "The Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library, 
Whittier, California." It contained pictorial highlights of Whittier and 
Nixon's career, intimately connecting the two on thick cardboard pages. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a great honor to see your presidential library standing on that 
Whittier hilltop, purchased with hopes just as high," wrote then-Mayor Keith 
Miller and Frederick Binder, who was Whittier College's president. 
</P>
<P>
Local Nixon friends and supporters also commissioned "The Nixon Trail: A Site 
Feasibility Study for the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library." 
</P>
<P>
Prepared by a prestigious architectural firm, the study contained a picture of 
a three-dimensional rendering of the library, which was envisioned sitting on a 
ridge among 120 acres of Whittier hillside -- above where the city's landfill 
is now located. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed complex consisted of two sets of concentric circles terraced down 
the hillside. There were also artists' conceptions of the library interior. The 
central gallery would feature NASA rockets and space capsules, which at the 
time is what the artists guessed would be remembered about the Nixon 
Administration. Indeed, the library study was submitted shortly after the first 
moon landing in December, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the study's authors proposed a historical trail winding through 
Whittier that included stops at the site of the favorite son's old law firm 
(Wingert, Bewley &amp; Nixon), three schools he attended, four former Nixon 
residences, the site of his father's store, the Quaker church and the location 
of his wedding reception. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, everything was on course. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
Although most Whittier residents remained sympathetic to Nixon, the impetus for 
the library literally dissolved as the scandal forced Nixon's resignation in 
August 1974. Choosing a location for his archives became a low priority. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no discussion of the library for a long time after he left office," 
said Bruce Martin, executive manager of the Whittier Chamber of Commerce. "The 
trials were still going on. I think everything went on hold." 
</P>
<P>
"Had it not been for Watergate, (the library) would have been here," said Clint 
Harris, a lifelong Nixon friend and Whittier resident who used to scrimmage 
head to head with the future President on the Whittier College football team. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier, though, was a finalist for the site, along with Yorba Linda and San 
Clemente, which was the location of Nixon's Western White House. This time, 
Whittier's offer had shrunk to 20 acres, but it included the same spectacular 
ridge. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez remembered attending a dinner party at the home of local Nixon boosters 
Ed and Ruth Shannon. Nixon's representatives were there, along with most of the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a gorgeous evening," Lopez said. "The hills we were overlooking, that 
was the Nixon site. We talked financing and so forth. We were willing to put in 
the road, sewage, water and to give them the land. It was all positive. They 
liked the site, the view and the town. 
</P>
<P>
"When they left that evening, they said, 'It looks pretty good to us.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the very next day's paper, Lopez said, he learned that San Clemente had been 
selected. In her personal files, Ruth Shannon said, she has a letter from Nixon 
describing his vacillation and agonizing. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'If I followed my heart, it would go to Whittier.' He felt it should 
be at San Clemente because of his years at the White House," Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, however, an unexpected problem had thwarted the San Clemente plans, 
and the search for a library site was on again. Whittier officials began their 
third and final bid for it. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the city wooed Nixon representatives by pitching a tent and a 
display at the proposed site, Chandler said. But for the most part, the 
lobbying went on behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
It helped that Yorba Linda already had preserved Nixon's birthplace as a 
historic site and could offer an adjacent land parcel for the library. 
</P>
<P>
So Yorba Linda, a sleepy Orange County suburb, is looking forward to an 
estimated 350,000 library visitors a year and the tourist dollars they will 
leave behind. Whittier, a city still trying to rebuild from the October 1987 
earthquake, will sorely miss the income and the prestige, city officials said.

GRAHAM SAYS MEDIA MAGNIFIED NIXON'S FAILINGS AND DEFEATS 
</P>

<P>
Comparing Richard M. Nixon to King David and Abraham Lincoln, the Rev. Billy 
Graham on Wednesday said Nixon is not a "tragic figure" but a leader whose 
failings and defeats were greatly magnified by the glare of television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, the worldwide evangelist said he is still 
baffled by the Watergate controversy that forced the resignation of his 
longtime friend and golfing buddy 16 years ago. He predicted that future 
historians will not consider Watergate a constitutional crisis as Nixon's foes 
did in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that bothered me about the whole thing was the language that he 
used on the tapes," Graham said, referring to transcripts of secretly recorded 
conversations in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes provided what some considered evidence of Nixon's attempt to cover up 
the Watergate break-in and revealed the former President's use of profanity. 
The phrase "expletive deleted" -- substituted for profanity by transcribers of 
the tapes -- became a popular joke throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know and none of his close friends ever knew that he even knew some 
of those words," Graham said. "I feel it wasn't the real Nixon. And, of course, 
I believe in supernatural powers, of both good and evil, and I think some of 
these were at work at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Such struggles are not unusual for national leaders, said Graham, who flew to 
Southern California to offer the dedicatory prayer at the Richard M. Nixon 
Library and Birthplace today in Yorba Linda. He said he considered the opening 
of the library to be the pinnacle of Nixon's career and a manifestation that 
most of the American people have forgiven the once-disgraced leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the history of Israel, the leaders of Judah and Israel were always 
up and down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet none of the Old Testament patriarchs or Lincoln were, like Nixon, forced to 
contend with a relentless press corps that broadcasted political problems and 
personal failings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at David," Graham said of the biblical hero who slew the giant Goliath. 
"He had to run and hide. And then he committed a murder and he committed 
adultery, which was abhorrent to God. But God forgave David and David is 
considered one of the greatest kings that ever lived in the history of Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
"If we would have had the cameras on David in those days, they might have 
rebelled against him. We would have had black headlines." 
</P>
<P>
After 16 years, Graham said, the American public is still confused about what 
drove Nixon from office. 
</P>
<P>
"I have read a lot about Watergate, but I still don't understand it," Graham 
said. "I don't understand why it became such a big thing, and neither do the 
people around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Graham first met Nixon in 1950, when the then-California congressman asked the 
evangelist to join him for a game of golf. Over the years, Graham said, the 
friendship grew to the point where he gave the invocation at Nixon's 
inauguration, held private White House church services during the Vietnam War 
and gave the eulogy for Nixon's mother, Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the friendship, the dark days of Watergate resulted in a breach in the 
relationship, Graham said. Nixon steadfastly refused to take his calls or to 
see him, even when he flew to Washington three days before the former President 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon continued to refuse his calls in the ensuing months, when he lay near 
death in a San Clemente hospital after a bout of phlebitis. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife rented an airplane, and it had a sign on it, 'Nixon: God loves you and 
so do we,' and flew it back and forth in front of the hospital," Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
About six months after Nixon left office, Graham said, the former President 
unexpectedly called and invited him for a visit in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a natural evening," Graham said. "He's a man that can rebound very 
fast from defeats and problems like that. I think he took it in its historical 
stride."

LAGUNA NIGUEL TO SUE BUILDER OVER DEED THAT SACRIFICED LAND; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: COUNCIL VOTES TO HALT CONSTRUCTION AND MOUNT A LEGAL DRIVE AGAINST 
THE DEVELOPER WHO BUILT ON ACREAGE INTENDED FOR PARKLAND.

LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a stormy marathon meeting, the City Council voted early Wednesday to 
mount a legal drive to void a 1988 deed that officials now say mistakenly gave 
a developer nearly 100 acres that had been set aside for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a 3 1/2-hour executive session shortly after 1 a.m., the council 
voted 4-0 to halt further development on the property and to sue Taylor Woodrow 
Homes California Ltd. over the luxury houses already built on the land. 
</P>
<P>
All public interest in the land, estimated to be worth between $40 million and 
$70 million, was relinquished in a deed signed by Laguna Niguel Councilman 
James F. Krembas three months before Taylor Woodrow hired his wife. About 100 
homes -- and foundations for another 77 -- now stand on the property, which 
borders the Salt Creek Corridor Regional Park and is part of Taylor Woodrow's 
Marina Hills planned community. 
</P>
<P>
"We are saying that our business is protecting the public's property and the 
public's rights," Laguna Niguel Mayor Patricia Bates said. "And when necessary 
we will do it with force." 
</P>
<P>
Krembas, who is under investigation by the Orange County district attorney, 
abstained on the vote and sat outside the closed-door council session. After 
the meeting, he repeated that he had acted unwittingly and suggested that 
responsibility for the transaction lies elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Krembas, who signed the deed while serving on the Laguna Niguel Community 
Services District, alleged that Taylor Woodrow had misrepresented the deed as 
part of another, smaller transaction and that the district board's staff failed 
to correct the misconception. The Community Services District administered 
parkland before Laguna Niguel incorporated as a city earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted early Wednesday to instruct the city manager to 
investigate the actions of James S. Mocalis, the chief district executive who 
signed the deed along with Krembas, and James S. Okazaki, the attorney who 
notarized both their signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Krembas said he was pleased by the council action to question others. 
</P>
<P>
"I said there were no improprieties that the CSD committed," Krembas said. "I 
did not say there were no improprieties all the way around." 
</P>
<P>
Okazaki also said he welcomed the investigation into his actions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the council's decision to look into the matter, including me and Jim 
Mocalis, is the proper direction to take," Okazaki said. "Jim and I know when 
everything is said and done it is going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow President Gordon Tippell appeared stunned by the council's 
decision to begin legal action against his firm. Tippell, two lawyers and a 
bevy of staff members had come armed with stacks of documents and maps to 
explain the land transfer but were given a total of six minutes to present 
their case before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Tippell told the council that his firm's plans to build on the land, which had 
been dedicated as open space, were approved by the county in 1985 in exchange 
for a park and ball fields and other public benefits. Krembas' signature on the 
deed "simply formalized this agreement," Tippell said. 
</P>
<P>
Tippell also contended that the district board had been fully apprised of the 
land transfer -- and in fact voted to approve it -- at a meeting on Jan. 20, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
A one-page staff report from Mocalis presented on Jan. 20 recommended that the 
board approve some boundary changes to Marina Hills. The report explained that 
Taylor Woodrow was offering to swap eight acres of open space in exchange for 
three acres of steep slopes that were considered less desirable. 
</P>
<P>
Mocalis' recommendation, which the board approved, as well as subsequent 
minutes from the meeting, makes no mention of a deed relinquishing the public's 
right to 96 additional acres of open space. However, included in a packet of 
information prepared by Mocalis for the meeting is a letter outlining Taylor 
Woodrow's request that the board sign a quit-claim on the two parcels of land 
previously offered as open space. 
</P>
<P>
"We are totally confident that the appropriate procedures were followed 
throughout the approval process," said Tippell, reading from a prepared 
statement. "We strongly urge the council not to consider such drastic measures 
as a building moratorium or litigation until all the facts are known." 
</P>
<P>
Council members indicated they were unimpressed with the company's 
presentation. All three of the members who had served on the Community Services 
District at the time of the transfer said they never had any intention of 
signing away the 96 acres and that it had never been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we have to go back to the minutes of the meeting," Mayor Bates said. 
"The parcels to be deeded as presented (totaled) eight (acres) and that was the 
focus of the discussion." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel Councilman Paul M. Christiansen, who also served on the district 
board, echoed Bates' comments and rejected Taylor Woodrow's contention that the 
land change had already been approved by the county and therefore required no 
consideration by the Community Services District. 
</P>
<P>
"What would Taylor Woodrow have done without our deed?" Christiansen asked. 
</P>
<P>
After council members emerged from the executive session, Allan Songstad, an 
attorney for Taylor Woodrow, attempted to explain the property's history, 
offering to provide a lengthy presentation with maps and other documents. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with the threat of litigation . . . we are still willing to open up our 
books," Songstad said in a plea to delay the vote. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Terry Dixon responded that the council had already considered in 
executive session each of the factors outlined by Songstad and had still agreed 
to proceed with legal action against the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Why couldn't it all have been explained in a letter back then so that we 
wouldn't need to be speculating two or three years later what was intended?" 
Dixon asked rhetorically in an interview after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The council's vote came after an emotionally charged meeting that drew a 
standing-room-only crowd of residents who packed the tiny council chambers and 
spilled over into a parking lot. About a dozen residents who told the council 
they were shocked and saddened by news of the land transfer drew applause and 
occasional cheers from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow did get an opportunity to present its case to county officials 
and representatives of the district attorney's office in a three-hour meeting 
later Wednesday. John Sibley, deputy director of the county's Environmental 
Management Agency, acknowledged that he and other top county land planners met 
with the firm's representatives but declined to comment further.

FREAK ANAHEIM ACCIDENT OCCURS WHILE CHILDREN ARE ALONE

<TEXT>
<P>
A 5-year-old boy shot and wounded his older brother and a playmate with a 
single bullet Wednesday in a freak accident that happened while the boys were 
left unattended, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the shooting occurred about 2:30 p.m. in a quiet apartment complex 
on the 600 block of West Broadway as Katherine McGuire's sons were playing with 
a neighbor boy. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Sinescu, 22, who lives next door, said she was watching television 
when she heard a single gunshot. She ran out the door and saw McGuire's 
youngest son standing in the open doorway of his apartment, facing outdoors, 
holding a black .38-caliber handgun in his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked at me and said, 'Please help us,' " Sinescu said. "At first, I 
thought he was going to shoot me. Then, I saw his brother lying on the carpet 
inside with blood all over, and he said, 'Help me.' I realized they were 
playing with a gun and the little one shot him." 
</P>
<P>
Sinescu said she darted into the McGuires' apartment, where Edgar McGuire, 11, 
was on the floor, bleeding from a bullet wound to the chest, and Oscar Flores, 
10, a boy from another building in the complex, was sitting on a couch with a 
bullet lodged in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Both boys were taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where Oscar was in 
serious but stable condition Wednesday evening, said hospital spokeswoman Betty 
Chrisco. Edgar's condition was not released at the request of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine McGuire and Oscar's parents, Margarita and Hector Flores, declined to 
be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's shooting was the latest in a series non-gang-related incidents 
involving youths and guns. Since September, there have been at least five other 
shootings, four of them fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry said the latest incident occurred after the two 
older boys found the handgun in a box in McGuire's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
"They had evidently taken the gun out, looked it over, laid it down and left 
the apartment for a very short period of time," Barry said. "When they came 
back, lo and behold, there stands the 5-year-old in the living room, and he has 
the gun in his hand." 
</P>
<P>
The older boys, one standing behind the other, screamed at the 5-year-old to 
put the gun down, but "that may have startled or confused him, and in the 
process of maneuvering it, he set it off," Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said there is "no doubt" the shooting was an accident. The 5-year-old, 
whose name was withheld, was taken into protective custody, interviewed by 
police and turned over to Orangewood Children's Home for counseling, Barry 
said. He said police are continuing their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Sinescu said she had rarely seen McGuire, who is deaf, since she and her sons 
moved into the complex from Canoga Park on July 1. But whenever she saw the 
boys, they appeared to be unsupervised, Sinescu said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked to me like those kids were living there by themselves," Sinescu 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Devine, manager of the Summerhill Plaza apartment complex, said McGuire, 
who communicates with her through written notes, "seems very nice." But Devine 
said she rarely sees her. She said McGuire does not work and subsists on 
government aid. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where she goes," Devine said. "Sometimes she swims with her boys 
in the pool here around 5 in the evening. The neighbors say those kids are real 
rambunctious, though. They're always playing music loud, late at night." 
</P>
<P>
Devine said McGuire arrive home about half an hour after the shooting. Once the 
boys were on their way to the hospital, a neighbor broke the news of the 
shooting to Margarita Flores, Devine said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was hysterical," Devine said. "All she could say was, 'Oh my God, oh my 
God.' " 
</P>
<P>
Devine said Oscar is well-known and liked throughout the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a wonderful little boy," Devine said. "He's probably the nicest boy who 
lives here." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors described the salmon-colored, 162-unit complex as quiet, populated 
mostly by singles and couples who work. There are about a dozen small children 
in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of thing has never happened before," Devine said. "It's 
unbelievable."

The parents of an 18-month-old girl were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of 
child endangerment after their daughter was found floating face down in a 
bathtub, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The child, Elizabeth DeArmond, was taken to Brea Community Hospital and later 
to Children's Hospital of Orange County, where she was listed in critical 
condition, La Habra Police Sgt. Phil Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth and her 2 1/2-year-old sister, Heather, were taking a bath unattended 
when the accident occurred about 7:30 p.m., Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
"The older sister started yelling for their mother and (the mother) found the 
baby floating face down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrived at the family's apartment in the 600 block of North Ward Street 
before paramedics and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation as they took the 
child to the hospital in a squad car, Stufflebean said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't afford to wait (for paramedics)." 
</P>
<P>
Officers Chris Coelber and Ron Braasch were able to revive Elizabeth, 
Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
The mother, Diana, who told police that Elizabeth may have been face down in 
the water for up to three minutes, and the father, Jimmy DeArmond, 26, were 
arrested after the child was taken to the hospital, Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
As officers tried to question the parents, "there was a general lack of 
cooperation," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Both were booked into La Habra Jail and were being held in lieu of $10,000 bail 
each. 
</P>
<P>
Heather was taken to Orangewood Children's Home in Orange under protective 
custody, Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say an average of 17 children under age 9 have drowned in Orange 
County each year since 1978. So far, at least seven children have drowned this 
year.

<P>
Seeking to check the proliferation of billiard parlors and pool halls, the City 
Council this week passed an ordinance requiring those businesses to get 
conditional use permits. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance allows the Planning Commission to revoke the permits if it can be 
determined that the businesses encourage crime. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance defines adult businesses and requires that non-adult businesses 
(such as video rental stores) not devote any more than 15% of their floor area 
to adult items. JIM TORTOLANO

SCHOOL DISTRICT SUES TRUMP OVER AMBASSADOR LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking to acquire most of the land now occupied by the closed Ambassador Hotel 
to build a high school, the Los Angeles Unified School District has sued New 
York developer Donald Trump and his partners who own the mid-Wilshire property. 
</P>
<P>
The suit against Trump Wilshire Associates is expected to kick off a court 
battle involving both a possible sale price and the district's claim of eminent 
domain over the land. 
</P>
<P>
"The suit says we are a public agency and as such have a right to acquire the 
property which is necessary to our school project," Edward Szczepkowski, an 
attorney for the district, said Wednesday. He predicted that it would take 
about a year for the district to gain control of the land if the matter goes to 
a jury trial to establish a price. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Trump group could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The school district wants 17 of the 23 1/2 acres of the hotel property, leaving 
the Wilshire frontage for possible commercial development. Before his money and 
marital problems began to chip at his image, Trump said he planned to build the 
world's tallest building on the site. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the state Allocation Board gave the district $50 million in state bond 
money to acquire the land for a high school needed to accommodate a burgeoning 
student population. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Wednesday, an attempt by two members of the Allocation Board to 
cancel the funding was narrowly defeated on a tie vote, but not before it 
triggered an angry outburst from Assemblyman Mike Roos and Assemblywoman Maxine 
Walters, both Democrats from Los Angeles who have lobbied heavily for the 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Roos threatened to abolish the board if it jeopardized the funds. 
</P>
<P>
W. J. Anthony, director of the Department of General Services, and Finance 
Director Jesse Huff moved to cancel the allocation because they said the school 
board has not delivered a convincing guarantee that it would not ask for more 
funds. The attempt was defeated on a tie vote. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not playing honorably and both of you know it," Roos told the two. 
</P>
<P>
Roos, who is chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means subcommittee on public 
employees and bonded indebtedness, declared: "$800 million in prospective bond 
issue sits in my committee. And if this is the way (the board) plays, then we 
don't need the Allocation Board. We'll (his subcommittee) be the Allocation 
Board for the bonds." 
</P>
<P>
That brought a heated response from board members. "This is an out-and-out 
threat to the board," Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael) said. "Beware, my 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jim Nielson (R-Rohnert Park), another board member, said: "This means that 
the greatest political power can roll over the board and get whatever the hell 
it wants. I won't stand for that." 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Los Angeles school board President Jackie Goldberg said 
that the move to take away the school funding was the result of a "simple 
misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
The school board has already passed one resolution promising that it would not 
ask for more funds for the Ambassador acquisition, she said. But Goldberg said 
the board would meet Monday to adopt language that would satisfy Anthony and 
Huff. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) told Roos: 
"You shouldn't have threatened the committee."

EL TORO BASE TOPS FIRMS' AIRPORT LISTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The El Toro Marine Corps Air Station topped the list of potential airport sites 
suggested by three engineering firms that are competing for a chance to develop 
plans for the Orange County Cities Airport Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Although El Toro has been repeatedly rejected by the Pentagon and the County 
Board of Supervisors, Ken Delino, executive director of the authority, said 
that was the only site named by all three firms. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago the airport authority asked firms to choose the sites they 
believe are best suited for further airport planning to relieve overcrowding at 
John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Delino said a consortium involving P&amp;D Technologies and Greiner Engineering 
suggested further study of El Toro, George Air Force Base in San Bernardino 
County -- the site preferred by Orange County county supervisors -- and 
Cristianitos Canyon in South County. 
</P>
<P>
A partnership of Fox Consulting and HTR Engineering proposed El Toro, 
Cristianitos Canyon, March Air Force Base in Riverside County and Potrero Los 
Pinos in Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The third firm, Phoenix-based Franzoi-Corey, suggested El Toro, George Air 
Force Base and a combined facility joining John Wayne Airport with the Tustin 
Marine Corps helicopter base. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors has decided to pursue George Air Force Base, which is 
being abandoned by the Pentagon, after rejecting Cristianitos Canyon and South 
Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The engineering firms will be interviewed by the Airport Authority on July 25 
and one will be selected in the hope that supervisors will eventually change 
their minds about using the site in San Bernardino County. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

Residents now must pay for paramedic services under a new program approved this 
week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The Paramedic Subscription Program allows residents and business owners to 
choose whether they want to pay a yearly rate of $36. 
</P>
<P>
The fee may be in bimonthly installments of $6 and covers all members of a 
household and up to 10 employees per business. 
</P>
<P>
Those who choose not to participate will be billed for any use of paramedic 
services, ranging from $125 to $250 for a call. 
</P>
<P>
Provisions are made to reduce the rate for the elderly or poor. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Burch, a retired fireman, was the only resident to speak in opposition to 
the fee. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a hidden tax," Burch told the council Monday night. "I think it 
is just wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Kenneth B. Jones agreed with Burch, but said: "We have to do this 
whether we want to or not." 
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at offsetting the cost of providing emergency services and 
at bolstering the city's ailing budget. Paramedic services cost the city more 
than $1.1 million last year, Fire Marshal Don Tully said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city had an operating deficit of $1 million, which officials 
took from the reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate that the paramedic fee program will recoup as much as 50% of 
the loss, or $500,000. At least 30% of the population is expected to 
participate, Tully said.LYNDA NATALI

CITY COUNCIL REJECTS SENIOR HOUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A small group of homeowners in the central part of the city has successfully 
opposed a senior housing complex that members said would bring too much traffic 
and be inappropriate in their neighborhood of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council denied a plan to build a two-story, 15-unit senior housing 
project on Rio Vista Street, just south of Lincoln Avenue, despite arguments 
that the project offered affordable housing and was within walking distance to 
nearby shops. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very, very stable neighborhood with single-family homes, and it's 
very right for senior housing, but that doesn't mean it needs to be built this 
way," said Councilman Tom Daly. 
</P>
<P>
This is the third time in one year that residents have opposed, and the City 
Council has rejected, different projects for the parcel of land. One project 
was an eight-unit apartment complex and the other was a commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen residents this week spoke against the senior housing project, 
offering several reasons for their opposition. Some were concerned that the 
building would be too large for the plot of land, which is about a third of an 
acre, and too close to homeowners' property. Others argued that an apartment 
complex would bring too many residents and too much traffic to the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
George F. Murdock wrote in a letter to the council that he was opposed to the 
project because the height of the building would "block out the afternoon and 
evening sun." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 against the project, with Mayor Fred Hunter in favor 
of it. Hunter said he voted for the project because the city needs more 
affordable senior housing, and the location offered seniors easy access to a 
number of nearby stores. LISA MASCARO

MEETING TONIGHT ON RECYCLING PROJECT

<TEXT>
<P>
A town meeting will be held tonight to offer information about Recycle Anaheim, 
the city's curbside recycling program, which will begin citywide service next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have been mailed information on the program, but organizers said the 
town meeting -- featuring a video presentation -- would help encourage 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
The program, administered by Anaheim Disposal Inc., which handles the city's 
trash collection, began as a pilot plan last September at 11,000 households 
throughout the city. Officials say the trial program was able to divert more 
than 3,000 tons of recyclable refuse from Orange County landfills during the 
first 10 months, and its success encouraged them to take the program citywide. 
</P>
<P>
The town meeting is at 7 p.m. at Canyon High School, 220 S. Imperial Highway.

MIKE PENNER: APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING WHEN SIZING UP WHITE'S TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is mid July, Wally Joyner and Chili Davis are on the disabled list, the 
Angels are knocking on fifth place's door and Devon White is in Edmonton, 
re-learning how to hit. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is sad, on all fronts, in every sense of the word. 
</P>
<P>
To replace Joyner, the Angels' second-leading run-producer, the club recalls 
Edmonton first baseman Lee Stevens, who had yet to have a major league at-bat. 
To replace Davis, the Angels' third-leading run-producer, the club recalls 
Edmonton catcher Ron Tingley, owner of a .149 career major league batting 
average. 
</P>
<P>
His old team is headed south, but White isn't. The Angels need him but they 
don't want him. Not now, not yet. White was sent north for a reason -- remedial 
tutoring in Applied Woodwork 101 -- and classes have been in session for barely 
a week. Considering the stated course objective -- "To recapture the 
consistency that can make him a great player," Doug Rader says -- this could 
take some time. 
</P>
<P>
So White, one year removed from the American League All-Star team, remains in 
Edmonton, trapped. Trapped by circumstances, trapped by the wildest uppercut in 
the free world, trapped by four months of brilliance in the summer of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, the best thing to happen to White was also the worst. In the first 
half of his first full big league season, White batted .293 with 17 home runs 
and 50 RBIs. By the end of July, he had 19 home runs and was closing in on 70 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers waylaid the Angels, who were expecting, maybe, a few stolen bases 
and a few doubles into the gap. 
</P>
<P>
More crucially, the numbers also waylaid White. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, White had the look of an unpolished Willie Wilson: line-drive 
hitter, limited punch, good speed. His minor league stats supported the 
comparison to the death. White hit seven, eight and 14 home runs during his 
last three seasons in the minors. Only once, when he split 74 RBIs between 
Midland and Edmonton in 1985, did he drive in as many as 70 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Four months into the 1987 season, White began thinking he might be Eric Davis. 
</P>
<P>
It was all fool's gold. As we've since seen, everything about that 1987 season 
was a deceit. That was the Year of the Rabbit, when a little juice was 
surreptitiously added to the baseball and the game all but careened off a 
cliff. 
</P>
<P>
A rookie hit 49 home runs. Even more amazingly, Wade Boggs hit 24. Joyner went 
from 22 home runs as 1986 rookie-of-the-year runner-up to 34 -- and didn't make 
the All-Star team. The World Series was won by, of all people, the Minnesota 
Twins, a team that had two starting pitchers but also baseball's burliest 
offense, let loose under the big top of a home park affectionately known as The 
Homerdome. 
</P>
<P>
It's a season that belongs in the dumpster, right next to strike-gutted 1981. 
Today, the artificially bloated power totals have no credibility, no meaning. 
The entire 162-game schedule, now just an aggravating blip on the grand 
statistical curve, should be fitted for an asterisk. 
</P>
<P>
Examine the fallout: 
</P>
<P>
Mark McGwire, the boy king of the 1987 sluggers, has become a reliable force in 
the middle of the lineup, but has yet to clear 33 home runs again. Boggs is 
Boggs again. Joyner has hit 37 home runs in nearly 400 games since the end of 
1987. And the Twins? General Manager Andy MacPhail was apparently so 
embarrassed by the scam his team pulled on the sport that he has been trading 
the Twins back into their rightful place -- fifth -- ever since. 
</P>
<P>
With White, the Angels can only hope the damage is not irreversible. But for a 
while, everyone involved was suckered. An Angel batting coach, Rick Down, 
proclaimed White to be the next Hank Aaron. White wanted to believe him, so he 
decided to look the part. 
</P>
<P>
Forget that White has always lacked the innate strength of Aaron or Bo Jackson 
or even Ruben Sierra. He had to swing from the heels. 
</P>
<P>
Forget that White is physically equipped to give the Angels precisely what they 
most need -- a dynamic leadoff hitter. White chose to chase the dollar signs 
hanging beyond the outfield fences. 
</P>
<P>
Forget that White's 24 home runs in 1987 would translate into about 16 during a 
normal season. Once the switch was flicked on, White wasn't about to turn back. 
He was born to go deep -- or would be damned if he didn't go down trying. 
</P>
<P>
After 2 1/2 seasons of diminishing returns, White has returned to Edmonton. At 
best, the assignment is a midseason tuneup. At worst, it's a remake of the Gary 
Pettis Story, where talented, young, Gold Glove-winning center fielder hits his 
way out of Anaheim, into Canada and, ultimately, onto another team's roster. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, that was a subplot from 1987 that White either didn't detect or 
respect. Now, he may be doomed to repeat it. 
</P>
<P>
With Angel General Manager Mike Port finally awakening to the possibility that 
his team might need retooling -- the view from Port's Anaheim Stadium box must 
not be too good -- another sad truth has surfaced. White, the man who could 
have brought Joe Carter or Ellis Burks to the Angels (with a bit of creative 
packaging) during the winter, now carries a surgeon general's warning. White's 
greatest resource, his potential, has been tainted, along with his market 
value. 
</P>
<P>
If Port wishes to keep his pitching intact, he has little ammunition other than 
White if he's truly intent on a shakeup. That leaves this choice: Deal White at 
cut-rate prices . . . or bite the bullet and pray the Edmonton experiment pans 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Who's to blame when situations degenerate? 
</P>
<P>
Port, for waiting too long to make a move? 
</P>
<P>
White, for waiting too long to try a course correction? 
</P>
<P>
Or those Haitian seamstresses who added something extra to their product in 
1987, helping create the grand Devon White illusion in the first place?

RAY'S PLAY STAYS STEADY DESPITE ANGELS' EVER-CHANGING LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Angels were trailing by three runs when Johnny Ray came to bat in the 
fourth inning of Wednesday's game against the Milwaukee Brewers and launched a 
Mark Knudson fastball into the right-field bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
He ended up with a home run and a single in four at-bats during the Angels' 3-2 
loss to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Ray has shaken off far greater discouragements than a 3-0 deficit this season 
and far greater distractions than the ever-changing lineup of streaking and 
slumping players. Through it all, Ray keeps putting up the numbers expected of 
a .289 lifetime hitter. 
</P>
<P>
After recovering from bursitis of the shoulder and being reactivated from the 
15-day disabled list June 9, Ray went seven for 14 in his first three games 
back. 
</P>
<P>
After taking July 4 and 5 off to be with his wife and newborn daughter in 
Oklahoma, Ray went four for eight in a 16-inning, 9-8 victory over Milwaukee in 
his first game back and was nine for 17 in his first three games back. 
</P>
<P>
And after missing a day for his father-in-law's funeral, Ray returned July 15 
to drive in the game-winning run in a 3-2 victory over the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a business," Ray said. "You've got to be out here every day and you've 
got to face it like that. You're supposed to be out here every day playing 
baseball and trying to win. How you feel shouldn't affect you. You're supposed 
to block all that stuff out and just play the game." 
</P>
<P>
Ray said several frustrating years he spent in Pittsburgh helped him develop 
that focus. As a Pirate from 1981 to 1987, Ray saw the cellar of the National 
League East three years in a row, from 1984-1986. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his steadily rising average, that focus isn't helping him through the 
frustration he's feeling as the Angels fell 13 1/2 games behind Oakland 
Wednesday. Ray said "there's no doubt" that a set lineup would help the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a set lineup all year, and that's been frustrating," Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have used 91 lineups in 92 games. Injuries have necessitated some of 
the shuffling. Eleven Angel players have been placed on the disabled list so 
far this season, compared to nine in all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader has been defensive about his lineup shuffling and 
points to the Toronto Blue Jays as a successful club without a set lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"If you use a set lineup, people say you're too set in your ways," Rader said 
before Monday's game, "and if you don't, people say you're doing too much 
tinkering." 
</P>
<P>
While Ray believes the absence of set lineup has hurt the team, he is also 
frustrated with himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been as consistent as I'd like," he said. "Any time you're hitting 
.260 or .270, you're not that consistent if you're an every-day ballplayer. I 
haven't played that well in the first half and I hope that I can get things 
going and maybe we can pick up some ground here."

BRIEFCASE / RETAIL: TUSTIN STORE TO FOLLOW NEW RULE IN SPORTING GOODS: BIG IS 
BETTER 
</P>

<P>
The move is toward bigness, says Jim Chick as he plans to open one of Orange 
County's largest sporting goods stores in the Tustin Market Place on Aug. 3. 
Market Place managers originally tried to get Chick's Sporting Goods to take a 
smaller space -- 35,000 square feet instead of 50,000 square feet -- but Chick 
convinced them that they would be making a mistake to opt for a mid-size store. 
</P>
<P>
"They want something that is going to draw from a large area, and I told them 
that the state of the art in my industry now is 50,000 square feet," said 
Chick, president of the sporting goods business founded by his father in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin store will be the sixth Chick's Sporting Goods outlet in Southern 
California. Ten years ago, the Chick's sporting goods store in Covina was the 
largest in the area at 22,000 square feet, Chick said. 
</P>
<P>
Chick says medium-size sporting goods stores are quickly disappearing. "It's 
breaking down into two types of stores: the megastore where you see everything 
in one place, and specialty stores where all the guys sells, say, are tennis 
rackets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Schmitz used to run a small chain of tennis specialty stores and now 
manages the tennis department of Go Sports at the Fashion Island mall in 
Newport Beach. "The trend is definitely going this way, to large stores with a 
lot of specialty people," he said. "If you can get a specialist in each 
department, you can really do some damage."

<P>
MANAGEMENT: CO-FOUNDER FRED COX'S SURRENDER OF CEO'S POST LEAVES SKEPTICS 
UNCONVINCED THAT THE SLUMPING COMPUTER PERIPHERALS FIRM CAN REPOSITION ITSELF 
IN A CHANGING MARKET.

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there was any doubt that Emulex Corp. is in transition, it was made clear 
when company co-founder Fred B. Cox said he would surrender his title as chief 
executive officer in a surprise announcement two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But whether the changes will bring the decade-old maker of computer peripherals 
consistently higher earnings or a fizzling financial performance is another 
question. 
</P>
<P>
To skeptical outside observers, the timing of Cox's decision suggested that he 
was taking the blame for a failed strategy that caused Emulex operating losses 
of $3.1 million in its third quarter ended April 1, the worst financial slump 
since in the firm's history. 
</P>
<P>
But Cox says Costa Mesa-based Emulex is bound for recovery as a diversified 
technology company, and he said his voluntary decision to step down from 
day-to-day management was needed to prepare Emulex for a successor and growth 
in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing sinister here," said Cox, 56, who will remain chairman and 
retain the CEO title while searching for a successor. "I feel good about the 
decision. I don't have any retirement in mind. I'm trying to make a selective 
and controlled transition." 
</P>
<P>
But skeptics who know Cox's management style say that he is a typical 
entrepreneur who has ruled Emulex with an iron fist and that it is unlike him 
to give up any control of the company without a bitter fight with the company's 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised about the downturn of the firm under Fred's leadership," 
said Steven W. Frankel, president of Emulex from December, 1984, to January, 
1988. "Fred should retire and a new chief executive should be given leeway to 
rebuild the company's place in the market." 
</P>
<P>
Frankel, recruited as Cox's heir-apparent, left Emulex after a power struggle 
in which he felt he was made a scapegoat for Emulex's lackluster performance. 
Now chief operating officer with a Santa Monica software firm, Frankel feels 
vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a repeat performance," he said. "They're moving in circles." 
</P>
<P>
Cox's interim replacement, David W. Hanna, said the company hasn't suffered 
irreversible damage in its latest downturn. But he acknowledges that Emulex has 
had a tough year in 1990 and that the company is in the midst of challenging 
period of change. 
</P>
<P>
Emulex derives its name from trying to "emulate" Digital Equipment Corp., for 
whom it first made minicomputer storage products. Despite several attempts to 
diversify, Emulex became known as the premiere third-party supplier in the DEC 
aftermarket. 
</P>
<P>
While DEC storage products accounted for 36.2% of sales last year, the company 
now also makes networking support equipment for DEC computers, add-on equipment 
for IBM-compatible computers, custom computer products, and microchips based on 
the increasingly popular Small Computer System Interface standard. 
</P>
<P>
Only a year ago, strong performance in each of its businesses produced record 
net income of $13.3 million on revenue of $148.6 million for the fiscal year 
ended July 2, 1989, compared to net income of $9.1 million on revenue of $125.1 
million in fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But times change quickly in the computer industry: 
</P>
<P>
The minicomputer market, which Emulex depends upon for 60% of its sales, is 
shrinking, and market leader DEC is slashing prices to compete with networks of 
increasingly powerful personal computers. That means Emulex must forage for new 
sales in a flat market where the industry leader is axing profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
The market competition is more fierce now. One fast-growing competitor, 
Anaheim-based Micro Technology Inc., has built a $54-million business in three 
years by focusing on higher-growth product niches than Emulex in the high-end 
DEC storage business, according to industry observers. Even Cox says he admires 
Micro Technology's success. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Emulex was hobbled this year by false starts in diversification. It 
withdrew a VME bus product from the market and canceled the development of 
another product at a cost of $1.2 million. It also suffered from a transition 
from a generation of high-profit SCSI computer boards to a new generation 
low-profit computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
"They spent a lot of money on research and development that hasn't come to 
fruition," said Mike Vizard, news director for Digital Review, a DEC trade 
journal in Newton, Mass. "They haven't introduced anything technically 
spectacular in a while." 
</P>
<P>
The company reported lower earnings in the first half of the fiscal year and an 
operating loss of $3.1 million for its third quarter ended April 1. During the 
quarter, the company restructured and wrote off more than $1.8 million in 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
"On Wall Street, this stock is considered a fallen angel," said Michael Woods, 
editor of OTC Review Special Situations, an investment advisory newsletter in 
Philadelphia. "The company is past its period of skyrocketing growth, and it 
must find new ways to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts think it will. Candace King Weir, an analyst with C.L. King &amp; 
Associates in Albany, N.Y., believes that Emulex is poised for a turnaround in 
fiscal 1991, based on the growth potential of the company's non-DEC businesses. 
</P>
<P>
She estimates that the company will earn $7.5 million on revenue of $155 
million for the year ending June 30, 1991, contrasted with an expected loss of 
$1.6 million on revenue of $120 million for the year ended June 30, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But Vizard at Digital Review said he would be surprised if Emulex performs that 
well. Aside from a significant custom-manufacturing contract, he expects little 
change in the company's revenues because of overall flat sales and stiff 
competition in its market segments. 
</P>
<P>
Hanna said DEC has such a large installed base that it will survive any 
minicomputer shakeout; thus Emulex can depend on the DEC market for sales 
growth, especially in the area of networking products. And although the DEC 
products market remains competitive, it is comfortably free of foreign 
competitors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the non-DEC side, Hanna said Emulex is introducing more products that allow 
computers to communicate, and the SCSI-chip business is blossoming. The company 
has also landed a contract for custom-manufacturing a product for an 
unidentified computer firm that could bring it up to $20 million in revenues 
during fiscal 1991, contrasted with $3 million expected for fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Hanna said the company has kept its engineering team intact and made 
multimillion-dollar investments in key manufacturing technology. Cox said the 
company rebounded in its fourth quarter ended June 30 and expects to report 
profits for the period. Hanna predicted that the company would continue to be 
profitable in the first quarter of fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a tough year, but we're past the bottom," Cox said. "We've got the 
revenue turnaround, we have a lot of cash, no debt, a stronger balance sheet, 
world-class manufacturing and the same good engineering team." 
</P>
<P>
Cox said he plans to remain active in the company as chairman and retain his 
large share of stock in the corporation, and he will take his time to find the 
right successor this time. He expects the search to be completed by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a tough decision," Cox said. "But I would not take a hike and 
leave this company at a point when it needed me." 
</P>
<P>
While Cox said he has the full support of the company's board of directors, 
some observers believe that the restructured board, which still has one empty 
position, will play an increasingly important role in Emulex's future. 
</P>
<P>
P. Andrews McLane, a partner with the venture capital firm TA Associates in 
Boston, raised eyebrows among skeptics when he rejoined Emulex's board in March 
after a five-year hiatus. Skeptics took that as a sign that TA Associates, 
which owns 13% of Emulex, was concerned about the problems at Emulex and that 
McLane was maneuvering to remove Cox from the company. 
</P>
<P>
But McLane, whose company provided start-up capital for Emulex in 1979, said he 
rejoined Emulex's board at Cox's invitation. He said he removed himself from 
the board earlier only because TA Associates was considering a takeover of 
Emulex in the fall of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hanna, a turnaround manager who has been involved with a dozen companies since 
1982, also has McLane's blessing. He wants to make Emulex a market-driven 
company instead of a technology-driven company. 
</P>
<P>
Hanna said that could mean a closer relationship with DEC than in the past, a 
possible acquisition in the networking products market, more emphasis on 
marketing campaigns at trade shows, and a new focus on international sales, 
which account for 40% of business. 
</P>
<P>
"The real transition (at Emulex) is not related to management changes, but to 
new markets," Hanna said. "We've cleaned up the balance sheet and we're 
shifting into a new way of doing business."

SUMMER SLUMP BRINGING CLOTHESTIME EARNINGS DIP

Clothestime Inc., the discount women's apparel retail chain, said Tuesday that 
earnings for its current quarter will fall below previous expectations as a 
result of sluggish summer sales. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings for the second quarter ending July 30 are expected to be 11 cents a 
share, compared to 16 cents a share in the year-ago quarter, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
John Shanklin, chief financial officer, said the lower earnings reflect a 
decision not to advertise this year. July sales are down about 9%, contrasted 
with a 34% sales increase a year earlier. Shanklin said the company advertised 
heavily on television before the sales increase last year. 
</P>
<P>
The advertising was intended to inform customers that Clothestime would change 
the type of merchandise it offers, from private label to off-price brand names, 
said Gregg Sloate, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had expected second-quarter earnings to be a few cents higher than 
the 11 cents a share that Clothestime is now predicting. However, Sloate said 
the decrease from last year's second quarter was no surprise. "It is not an 
easy comparison to go up against," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Clothestime's announcement, Sloate said he has lowered his 1990 
estimate for Clothestime from 26 cents a share to 20 cents. 
</P>
<P>
For its fiscal 1990 year ended Jan. 27, Clothestime earned $461,000 on revenue 
of $187 million, despite a fourth-quarter loss of $4.2 million. The company 
lost $1.4 million on sales of $46.8 million for its fiscal 1991 first quarter 
ended April 28. 
</P>
<P>
Clothestime stock, traded over-the-counter, closed Wednesday at $3.875 per 
share, down 6.25 cents.

BUNDLE OF FUN! AIMS TO HONE CHILDREN'S PLAYTIME INITIATIVE; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: A FORMER DAY-CARE TEACHER SAYS YOUNGSTERS TEND TO DISCARD HIGH-TECH 
TOYS IN FAVOR OF SIMPLE ONES THAT SHE PUTS IN HER TOTE BAG.

<P>
If you have children, wander into their rooms and take note. 
</P>
<P>
How many of their toys can pass the rain test? 
</P>
<P>
In other words, how many toys would be destroyed by something as simple as 
water? And how many batteries in those toys would rust, or the electronics 
irrevocably flooded? 
</P>
<P>
That should give you an idea of how far afield from a child's imagination the 
toy world can get. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Lissie of New Britain, Conn., recently started a mail-order business, 
Bundle of Fun! based on the notion that children are given too many toys that 
don't require imagination. Her toys -- prepackaged in age-appropriate canvas 
totes -- include blocks, books and puppets that fit a toddler's hand. There are 
no battery-operated or electronic toys. 
</P>
<P>
Lissie, who before she started her business was head teacher at a day-care 
center, said she got the idea soon after the birth of her daughter, Amanda, now 
3. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dealing with kids at the day care where their imaginations were gone," 
she said. "Toys do everything for them. They don't have to be creative to know 
how to operate them." 
</P>
<P>
Bundle of Fun! was born. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is so inundated with high-tech toys," Lissie said. "I find people 
are more interested in something that's going to be a keepsake." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Romano, director of the preschool at Apple Tree Day Care Center in 
Middletown, Conn., said that the children there are much more interested in 
dressing up or playing in the center's pretend kitchen than operating a 
joystick. 
</P>
<P>
They do not ask for Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
"Creative toys, toys that don't have a function, are the best," Romano said. A 
large cardboard box is probably a favorite among kids, she said. "They can 
paint it, cut it, live in it. They love that. 
</P>
<P>
"They play with them longer, too." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to say what the kids at Hartford's Oak Tree Day Care Center like to 
play with most. 
</P>
<P>
It might be the blocks. 
</P>
<P>
It might be trucks or books. 
</P>
<P>
"They form their own little groups and do different things," director Jane 
Thompson said. "Everything is their favorite toy." 
</P>
<P>
They do not play with high-tech toys because Thompson does not have any. And 
they don't ask for them when they arrive at the day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
That should come as no surprise to any parent who has purchased an involved 
electronic toy and assembled it, only to watch it get shoved into a corner once 
the child has figured out its purpose. A wander down the aisles of most of the 
larger toy stores reveal toys that light up, move in circles, talk or shoot 
imaginary spaceships from the sky -- kids not included. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the last few years, some toy stores have catered to a clientele 
more interested in creative toys. 
</P>
<P>
So Lissie may be on to something. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Nintendo craze (market analysts say the sales of just one Nintendo 
product could reach $1 billion this year), the big sellers still are the 
simpler toys, according to a spokeswoman at Toy Manufacturers of America, the 
industry trade association. The more popular toys are play kitchens, Hot Wheels 
cars, the classic Barbie doll and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures. 
</P>
<P>
Whether parents agree or disagree with the politics of a toy such as Barbie, at 
least the doll is non-electronic and requires some imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember my favorite toys: hobbyhorses on a stick, a rag doll you could 
carry around," Lissie said. "I remember creating my own little play world." 
</P>
<P>
But children are as much victims of a media blitz as are their parents, and 
children who watch a lot of television see commercials that make electronic and 
battery-operated toys seem like a must. Romano said parents can handle their 
children's requests for non-imaginative toys by limiting them to one special 
toy. 
</P>
<P>
"Say, 'I am not going to give you 10 of these,' " she said. "You don't want all 
their toys to be that way. If they have too many choices, they can't pick. 
Limit their choices. Get them one or two electronic toys. 
</P>
<P>
Electronic toys "are the way a lot of children are going. You can always lead 
them out of that." 
</P>
<P>
Lissie said that she has limited her tote bags to preschoolers, mainly because 
"once they get to be 5 or so, they get so trendy." Perhaps in the future, she 
said, she will make a play tote or basket for the older children. Her products 
sell for about $27. She offers four totes -- for the newborn baby and its 
mother; 1- to 2-year-olds; ages 2 to 3, and children 4 and older.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the hurricane-battered docks of Dickinson Bayou to the open waters past 
the petrochemical plants and the marsh grass, C.L. Standley is a veteran of 
Galveston Bay. 
</P>
<P>
At the helm of his 43-foot whitewashed shrimp trawler, the Captain Clyde, he 
plies the confluence of rich natural resources and smokestack industry that is 
Galveston Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The recent oil spill from the tanker Mega Borg, just 60 miles from the mouth of 
the bay, grabbed national attention, but it was merely a footnote to the 
obvious for people whose livelihoods revolve around the bay. 
</P>
<P>
The coexistence of industry and nature is constantly strained here in the 
nation's third-largest port area. More than half of United States' chemical 
production and a third of oil refining is done on the shores of Galveston Bay, 
which also produces a good share of the nation's seafood -- coming by way of 
nets like Standley's. 
</P>
<P>
Between unloading a day's catch -- 300 pounds of pale pink shrimp -- and 
mending a net torn when it was raked over oyster shells, Standley reflects on 
the catalogue of bay history represented by his 20 years of shrimping. 
</P>
<P>
Shot through with Texas twang and sentiment, his observations range from the 
interplay of environmental concerns, government regulation and the vagaries of 
"Mother Nature," to the violent cultural clash of Vietnamese fishermen and 
native Texans. 
</P>
<P>
The Mega Borg accident, Standley says, gives shrimpers pause. "The same spill 
in Galveston Bay would be devastating," he says of the 40,000-gallon 
light-crude-oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know the environmental threats were there that I know (about) now," 
he says of his 1970 start in shrimping, which came after earlier careers in 
chemical sales and teaching junior high science. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of danger to the environment dawned on him over time: He has 
followed ships' fuel slicks as big as five miles long; he's seen towboats come 
within a hairbreadth of rammings that could cause spills of "who knows what 
chemical"; and in the early-morning dark on his shrimping runs, "the stench of 
various chemicals sometimes almost would gag you." 
</P>
<P>
"From a fishing standpoint, I don't know what ill effects this all has. But 
it's kind of like growing up with the threat of the bomb. . . . You push (a 
Mega Borg-type disaster) out of your mind and hope it never happens," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he does not rail against industry. "I sometimes view the term 
'environmentalist' with a little bit of alarm because it seems a lot of them 
want to return to the way things were 100 or 200 years ago," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider myself an environmentalist, but not in the conventional sense. The 
environment should be maintained in as healthy a state as possible, but it has 
to adapt to some degree to modern civilization. Yet progress can't destroy 
Mother Nature; it has to be tempered with concern." 
</P>
<P>
Standley is a trustee of the Galveston Bay Foundation, a conservation group 
formed in 1987 to lobby against a proposed reservoir at the mouth of the 
Trinity River and dredging of the Houston ship channel. Both projects would 
affect the delicate balance of salinity of Galveston Bay water, which in turn 
would affect shrimp populations. 
</P>
<P>
It is not easy to get fiercely independent shrimpers involved in civic 
associations like this, because they may not see that environmental problems 
have a direct effect on their financial bottom lines, says Standley, who is a 
past president of Professional Involvement of Seafood Concerned Enterprises, an 
industry group. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, says Linda Shead, the Galveston Bay Foundation's executive director, 
Standley himself brings the shrimping industry's perspective to the 
environmental group, where it might otherwise be missed. 
</P>
<P>
She explains that shrimpers have a broad antipathy for any government 
regulation -- especially the kind that would limit the hours and seasons of 
fishing. 
</P>
<P>
While an environmental group might automatically back such regulations for the 
purpose of conservation of sea life, Shead explains that Standley "does his 
homework. . . . He studies the numbers, goes through regulations with a 
fine-toothed comb." And in at least one instance he has persuaded the group not 
to back government restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Government regulation, indeed, is one of Standley's pet peeves. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many regulations that, if he isn't a Philadelphia lawyer, a 
fisherman gets violations and doesn't even know it," he observes. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, federal and state governments began limiting seasons, hours and 
size of catch because of evidence of overfishing. 
</P>
<P>
Standley allows that there are three times more shrimpers in Galveston Bay 
today than when he started in 1970. Most of the growth in numbers comes from 
the influx of Vietnamese refugees. That has severely cut the profits shrimpers 
can make, he says. But he insists that shrimp populations don't appear to be 
depleted, because shrimping production has been "the same for 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
"These rules are to let smaller shrimp grow," he says. But the way he sees it, 
regulations just let a lot of good shrimp "high-tail it to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
The federal government has mandated turtle-excluding nets that would protect 
endangered sea turtles from drowning when caught in trawlers' nets. The nets 
are not required in Galveston Bay, but Standley says he still does not believe 
they are necessary in Texas coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
"In 20 years I've caught five sea turtles -- all were alive. And the boy over 
here (in the next boat) has never caught one," he says. "So I've got a hard 
time accepting that I'm a sea-turtle killer." 
</P>
<P>
Standley, raised on an East Texas rice farm, earned a college degree in 
agriculture. He says he eventually got into shrimping because it was a 
lucrative business. Today, however, "I sure don't do it anymore for the money." 
</P>
<P>
A sequence of hurricanes, drought, and floods -- which caused fresh water to 
affect salinity in the bay -- has caused losses for fishermen in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
But the increased number of shrimpers, which means having to share the wealth 
of the business, is the biggest sore point among shrimpers. 
</P>
<P>
Standley openly says he resents the Vietnamese fishermen, who flooded to the 
Texas Gulf Coast in the early 1980s and have received government financial 
assistance as refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Violence between the new fishermen and the native Texans erupts periodically. 
Standley even witnessed a recent standoff between a Vietnamese shrimper toting 
an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle and a native Texan over a crowding situation on 
the bay. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you'd call it racism or just the group that happened to come in. . . . 
There'd be resentment if it were Yankees or Vietnamese," he says, noting that 
the Vietnamese have begun to learn the unwritten code of shrimper conduct, 
which calls for getting in line instead of crowding in, and not throwing a wake 
over nearby boats. 
</P>
<P>
For all the troubles of life on the bay, there are intangible trade-offs that 
would lure a person away from terra firma, Standley says. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a man here who knows he can be in business next year. I'd sell out 
in a minute for a decent offer," he says, and then adds: "But then I'd be right 
back in it."

HE'S THE SON OF ZYDECO'S KING, BUT HE'S NOT THINKING ABOUT THE CROWN; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: C.J. CHENIER, SON OF ZYDECO PIONEER CLIFTON CHENIER, DECIDED THAT THE 
BEST WAY TO LIVE UP TO THE NAME IS TO BE HIMSELF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If ever a musician had cause to feel beleaguered, it would be C.J. Chenier, son 
of the late Clifton Chenier. He has quite a bloodline to live up to. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Chenier pioneered zydeco music in the '50s, his accordion-fired stew 
of Cajun and R&amp;B virtually defining the form, and the invention and zeal of 
his performances setting a nearly unattainable standard. Universally hailed as 
the King of Zydeco, Chenier often wore a crown during his performances -- and 
it looked good on him. 
</P>
<P>
But as his health failed in his last years -- he lost a leg to diabetes and 
required kidney dialysis -- and before his death in December, 1987, various 
zydeco upstarts had begun proclaiming themselves the new king. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than feel that he is responsible for the burden of a legacy or is in 
some kind of contest with other zydeco players, C.J. (Clayton Joseph) has 
decided that the best way he can live up to his father's name is just to be 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the way he'd have wanted it -- he wanted for me to play accordion, but 
he didn't want me to imitate him," Chenier, 32, said by phone Monday from a 
Colorado tour stop. "I think he'd have wanted me to just do what comes 
naturally to me, and that's what I do." 
</P>
<P>
Zydeco wasn't always the younger Chenier's natural element. Growing up, he 
lived with his mother in Port Arthur, Tex., while his father spent much of his 
time in French-speaking Cajun country. He didn't see that much of his father, 
only had one record of his music, and his friends ridiculed the zydeco style. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one song on the album I was crazy about, called 'Hot Rod' (it's the 
title track of C.J.'s next album). And sometimes he'd come by and pick me up, 
and I'd go to the club with him and listen to them playing. And I always found 
myself tapping my foot and really jumping around in the chair, even though that 
type of music wasn't really high on the list back then where I come from. But 
it's always been that kind of happy, make-you-move music." 
</P>
<P>
By age 20, Chenier was already adept on sax and keyboards and playing James 
Brown and Commodores covers in a funk band when his father asked him to join 
his Red Hot Louisiana Band on sax in 1978. The band, which plays Bogart's on 
Friday, currently features C.J. on vocals and accordion, Joseph Edwards on 
drums, Harry Hypolite and Joseph Chavis on guitar, Wayne Burns on bass, Wilbert 
Miller on sax, and R. C. Carrier on washboard. The original rubboard player, 
Clifton's 63-year-old brother, Cleveland Chenier, retired recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got this call: 'Pack your bags. You're going to California,' and that 
was it," he recalled. "That first trip was rough. I didn't know anything. I 
didn't know the songs, didn't know the music, didn't know the guys. I was just 
brand new to everything and had to start from scratch. And he left it up to me 
to get my own kind of feeling. Only every now and then did he tell me: 'It goes 
like this' or 'Put this in there.' 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, zydeco comes kind of naturally, and even though I didn't know it 
to start out, it's really a big part of me now." 
</P>
<P>
After four years, Chenier was made band leader, and shortly after that his 
father taught him to play accordion so that he could take some of the 
performance load off the ailing musician. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of nights when before the show he was real, real sick, but he 
didn't want to stop. He was happy on stage. He was quite a person." 
</P>
<P>
Although Chenier inherited his father's accordion, he has no intention of 
donning his crown. To him, the question of who is the current reigning player 
is moot. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys go around wearing the crowns and capes and all of that, but the music is 
the thing that's got to speak anyway. . . . And from my experience when I 
travel around, everybody I've come in contact with still calls Clifton Chenier 
the King of Zydeco." 
</P>
<P>
He said he doesn't worry about planting his feet in such large footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of like it because it makes me work harder. And we've been getting 
pretty good results. Like I said, I'm not trying to imitate him, and people 
notice that. They tell me I have my own style. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't try to play like a traditional accordion player. I'm a saxophone 
player, and I've still got saxophone licks in my head, so they just come out of 
my fingers on the accordion keyboard now instead." 
</P>
<P>
His goal for the music is fairly direct. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to make the audience feel like getting up and dancing. When we 
have an audience that doesn't get up and start moving, I really don't feel like 
I've done my job that night. Even in these places where they say there's no 
dancing allowed, they've got to get up and dance." 
</P>
<P>
 C.J. Chenier &amp; the Red Hot Louisiana Band and Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold 
Hard Facts will play Friday at 9 p.m. at Bogart's in the Marina Pacifica Mall, 
6288 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach. Tickets: $13.50. Information: (213) 
594-8975.

POP BEAT: O.C. BLUES DUO FINDS SUCCESS AFTER FINDING ITS OWN STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
WILL BRADY AND JODI SIEGEL GAIN ACCLAIM AFTER GIVING UP AN UNCOMFORTABLE, 
HYBRID MUSICAL PERSONA AND DOING WHAT COMES NATURALLY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For a while during their 10-year musical partnership, Will Brady and Jodi 
Siegel tried to be songsmiths, crafting would-be hits that they imagined being 
recorded by big-name pop stars. 
</P>
<P>
There also was a time when they would play Beatles songs, figuring that was 
what the people in the Orange County pubs and restaurants they played wanted to 
hear. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, though, Brady and Siegel decided that they had to please themselves 
before they could be a hit with anybody else. The way to do that was by playing 
the blues. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying so many styles. We were doing whatever it took to keep the 
gig," Siegel said as she and Brady sat in a Laguna Beach restaurant Tuesday 
night, recounting how Brady &amp; Siegel turned from an uncomfortable hybrid 
into an assured electric-blues duo. "People could see it wasn't true to who we 
were. They know when it's not authentic, or when you're not liking it." 
</P>
<P>
"You become non-recognizable, lose your identity," Brady chimed in without 
missing a conversational beat. Brady and Siegel have been working together long 
enough for their speech patterns to become as well-synchronized as their 
interwoven guitar lines. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, now 45, and Siegel, 34, found the answer to their musical identity 
crisis while noodling around between sets during those unsatisfying pop-hybrid 
days. Every time they had a few minutes to kill, they would unthinkingly start 
playing the blues. 
</P>
<P>
If that's what came naturally, the two guitarists decided, that's what they 
would be best off doing all the time. It was a smart decision: In the six or 
seven years since it was defined by the blues, Brady &amp; Siegel has evolved 
into an uncommonly fiery act that can reach back to the country blues tradition 
of Robert Johnson or leap forward into modern modes that echo such blues-based 
rockers as Little Feat, Bob Seger and Chuck Berry. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the blues didn't turn out to be a bad career move either. Instead of 
having to worry about keeping steady gigs, Brady and Siegel have settled into a 
regular routine on the local bar scene. Every Thursday night, they play at the 
Old Dana Point Cafe -- a gig they've held for 2 1/2 years -- and every Tuesday 
night for the past three months, they've been appearing at the Marine Room 
Tavern in Laguna Beach. In 1989, Brady and Siegel jumped into a Hyundai and 
took their blues around the country on a five-week tour, an experience that 
Brady said "gave us a feeling that it is possible to make all this happen" -- 
namely, stepping out of the small rooms of Orange County and onto a national 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Opening for Albert King recently at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, 
Brady, a tall, affable man with a furrowed, balding pate, and Siegel, with a 
tight tangle of flaming-red hair framing sharp facial features, proved that 
they can win a crowd of deep-blues aficionados. When they were introduced, 
silence greeted the two guitarists' names. It was Freebo, their sideman for the 
night, who drew a ripple of applause in recognition of his past tenure as 
Bonnie Raitt's bass player. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, though, the audience was hollering approval for Brady's clean, 
stinging Telecaster solos, delivered with back-arching body English, and for 
Siegel's unfettered raucousness on slide guitar. Between liberal solo 
trade-offs, both members showed a convincing, intense way with a blues vocal. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't play little, polite blues," Brady said of the duo's aggressive 
method. "You have to go in there slugging. It keeps you honest." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't fake the blues," Siegel echoed. "Either you can play it or you 
can't. It has to be part of your makeup. I get up on that bandstand, it's my 
fun zone. I'm on vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Siegel grew up in Chicago, the world's blues capital, where Duane Allman's 
signature solos for the Allman Brothers Band inspired her to take up slide 
guitar. But most of her public performances as a teen-ager centered on folk and 
pop. 
</P>
<P>
She moved to Orange County at 19 to attend Orange Coast College. Gravitating to 
the local club scene, she ran into Brady. The guitarist had been in on the 
ground floor of the Orange County music scene, running the lights at the Golden 
Bear in Huntington Beach during the folk boom days of 1964-65, when Roger 
McGuinn and David Crosby would drop in to play. In the mid-1970s, Brady played 
bass for three years with Honk, the only Orange County rock band of that era to 
make a national name for itself. (He still takes part in Honk's periodic 
reunion shows.) 
</P>
<P>
The two played together occasionally, then struck up a close musical 
partnership when Siegel and her blues-aficionado husband, Sid Shultz, took a 
top-floor apartment in a Laguna Canyon house where Brady was the downstairs 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
After years of performing together, the duo's first bid for wider recognition 
was its 1989 debut album, "Beer &amp; Donuts," which was produced by Freebo and 
financed largely by Patrick Farrah, a wealthy benefactor who would show up at 
Brady &amp; Siegel gigs offering $100 for every Jimmy Reed song they would 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The album, available at Brady &amp; Siegel shows, includes only one original 
song. Entitled "She Takes What She Wants," it's a saucy number that allows 
Siegel, a temperate, low-keyed woman offstage, to step into the hot and rowdy 
onstage mode she often favors. 
</P>
<P>
"The next (album) will have a lot more original songs," Siegel said. "If you 
want to make it in the blues world, you've got to have some originality, your 
own sound that distinguishes you from everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
As a redhead who plays a mean, traditional-sounding blues slide guitar, Siegel 
knows that it will take some effort for her to establish a distinct identity. 
</P>
<P>
"People come up to me and say, 'Bonnie Raitt, right?' " she said. "I say, 'No, 
I'm not Bonnie Raitt.' I guess it's inevitable. I'm honored to be compared to a 
four-time Grammy winner, but I don't want people to think I'm trying to be her, 
because I'm not. Any female blues player who grew up in the '70s (had to be) 
influenced by her. But I was just as much influenced by Freddie King and Duane 
Allman and Etta James." 
</P>
<P>
While waiting to take their next career step, Brady, who still lives in Laguna 
Beach, supports himself primarily as a guitar teacher; Siegel, now a Dana Point 
resident, works days in a record store. 
</P>
<P>
The point, Siegel said, is to play for the enjoyment of it and let any future 
career ascent flow from that. "We'd be doing this anyway," she said. "We'd be 
doing it for our own personal therapy." 
</P>
<P>
"Any musician has a dream about being recognized by your peers and making 
enough money so you can relax a bit and not worry about where your next dime is 
coming from -- which is the way it's been all my life," Brady said. "But I'd be 
doing it if I were on a desert island." 
</P>
<P>
Siegel's deadpan response: "That's our next gig. I got a call from Gilligan." 
</P>
<P>
Brady &amp; Siegel's next gig is tonight at 9 at the Old Dana Point Cafe, 24701 
Street of the Golden Lantern, Dana Point. Admission is free. Information: (714) 
661-6003. The duo, augmented by a three-man band, also plays every Tuesday 
night at 8 at the Marine Room Tavern, 214 Ocean Ave., Laguna Beach. Admission: 
$2. Information: (714) 494-3027. 
</P>
<P>
OFF-TANGENT: A show next Wednesday by Agent Orange, the Swamp Zombies and 
Medicine Rattle will be the finale for Club Tangent, the weekly 
alternative-rock showcase at the Marquee in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kitty Bash and Octavious, the two young promoters who have been 
putting on Club Tangent shows since last summer, appear to have found a new 
outlet: Starting next month, pending final agreement on a deal they have 
negotiated with owner Ray Camacho, they will book Thursday and Friday night 
shows at the Pink Cadillac in Anaheim under the moniker Tangent Productions. 
</P>
<P>
Club Tangent's four-month run at the Marquee is ending because it wasn't 
generating enough money, according to L. Trojan Tabak III, co-owner of the 
452-person-capacity club. 
</P>
<P>
Bash said the Marquee's identity as a haven for hard rock and heavy metal made 
it difficult to draw fans from the alternative-rock scene. Lacking a budget for 
advertising, she said, Club Tangent was not able to reach a potential clientele 
that normally wouldn't think of going to a heavy-metal club. Tangent drew an 
average of 80 to 100 concert-goers at the Marquee, Bash said, although in 
recent weeks, shows by Tender Fury and Caterwaul had boosted attendance to 180 
or 200. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually broke even, with sometimes a little extra (profit)," Bash said. 
</P>
<P>
From a club-owner's perspective, Tabak said, the Tangent crowd had a serious 
drawback: an inadequate thirst for bar drinks. 
</P>
<P>
"We served more water than anything else," he said, noting that the 
alternative-rock fans spent an average of $4 each on drinks, only half of the 
per-customer bar revenue on other weeknights. Tabak said he is considering 
offers from other promoters who have proposed booking blues acts, hard-rock 
bands or deejay dance nights on Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
Bash said Camacho invited the Club Tangent team to help him promote shows at 
the Pink Cadillac even before they learned that they were losing their slot at 
the Marquee. The Pink Cadillac already has established an alternative-rock 
identity with shows by some of the same bands that Club Tangent featured. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of sad, because I think the Marquee was a really neat venue, but 
we're going to be picking up where we left off," Bash said. She said that she 
and Octavious expect to sign a contract to book Thursday nights in August at 
the Pink Cadillac, then expand to Thursdays and Fridays at the end of the 
month, beginning with an Aug. 31 concert by Firehose. 
</P>
<P>
COLOR IT ORANGE: Club Tangent's last concert will mark a homecoming for Agent 
Orange, which hasn't played its native county since a 1987 show at Night Moves. 
Now based in Los Angeles, the band features a splendid new lineup, with 
founding singer Mike Palm backed by Brent Liles and Derek O'Brien, the 
bass-and-drums team from Social Distortion's early days. 
</P>
<P>
According to manager Moss Jacobs, Agent Orange has negotiated a long-sought 
release from its recording contract with Enigma Records. "We're going to 
examine a lot of possibilities and look at taking the band to the next step," 
said Jacobs, who is general manager of Avalon Attractions. As part of its 
severance agreement with Enigma, Agent Orange will record a live album of songs 
previously released on the band's studio albums and EPs. The recording takes 
place Saturday night at the Roxy in Hollywood, where Agent Orange will play two 
shows with the tape rolling. 
</P>
<P>
T.S.O.L. GETS L.O.S.T.: Also cut free from Enigma -- but not nearly so happy 
about it -- is T.S.O.L. The long-running local hard-rock band was among the 
acts whose contracts were dropped in a major shake-up last week at the Culver 
City label. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a shock to all of us," said T.S.O.L.'s manager, Mike Zoto. The 
band's current album, "Strange Love," was to have been the first in a 
multi-album deal reached last year. "After you let it sink in and release your 
emotions, it could be OK," Zoto said. "You can't sit and dwell on it. You've 
got to go out and make something happen. But it's something very new and has to 
be pondered for a while." Currently on a national tour, T.S.O.L. is scheduled 
to play Aug. 11 at Jezebel's in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The Enigma shake-up has producer Jon St. James feeling nervous about the 
possible impact on Bardeux, another Orange County act on the label's roster. 
"It doesn't affect our (recording) deal, but it affects everyone at Enigma" in 
terms of the label's ability to promote current releases, St. James said. "I 
understand (Enigma) cut the staff considerably," he said. With a new Bardeux 
single, "Shangri-La," surfacing with dance-club play, he said, "I hope the 
company is there to back it up."

HISTORIAN GATHERS LEGEND AND LORE OF ANGELES FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Environmental historian Donn E. Headley, midway through a 15-month project to 
probe legend and lore of the Angeles National Forest, had a confession. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm terrible with dates," the U.S. Forest Service historian said, as he 
reached into a gray metal cabinet in his Arcadia office, fishing for tales of 
how natural and man-made disasters have shaped the history of the Angeles and, 
in turn, greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Headley's occasional uncertainty is understandable. His task these days is as 
formidable as the San Gabriel Mountains themselves. 
</P>
<P>
He is compiling a historical portrait of the Angeles, whose 100th anniversary 
will be celebrated in 1992. And his deadline is December. 
</P>
<P>
Before it was called the Angeles, it was the San Gabriel Timberlands Reserve, 
the eighth such forest to be created, and the first one established in 
California. Today, overseen by the U.S. Forest Service, the 650,000-acre 
preserve is one of the most heavily visited national forests in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Headley's inquiry encompasses a wide range of politics, science, ecology, 
governmental affairs and geology. He is most fascinated with the interaction of 
human beings and the natural world. "The thing that interests me most is the 
relationship between the (Angeles) forest and the city." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, much of the impetus to set aside the land came from Los Angeles 
officials who saw the mountains' value principally as a source of water rather 
than a playground, and therefore a key in the development and marketing of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Headley, a UC Riverside doctoral candidate in history, is researching old-time 
stories of gold rushes and bandits and modern-day tales of how urban life has 
affected the flora and fauna. He was hired last September to work in the 
forest's Arcadia headquarters and is one of several historians who work for the 
Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
But he spends more of his time in front of a word processor and in reading 
rooms of the Huntington Library and Pasadena Public Library than he does in the 
forest, assessing how the Angeles affects millions of people, physically, 
psychically and emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
What impresses him, he said, is "that for all the urban growth, the little 
effect that humans have had on the San Gabriel Mountains. They tend to endure. 
</P>
<P>
"This idea of Los Angeles as the center of an island with mountains around it," 
he said, "has been a central point in Southern California history for 150 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Already, Headley, 36, has begun writing his historical narrative. It will 
appear in a short popular history for the public and in another, more lengthy, 
volume to be used within the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Headley's historical tidbits have also been appearing in the 
"Grapevine," an in-house newsletter for Angeles employees. 
</P>
<P>
In the newsletter, Headley, whose area of expertise is water's role in Southern 
California, has discussed the 19th-Century water wars among feuding and 
drought-stricken residents of Duarte, Azusa and Covina. Gunfire and scuffles 
were often used to settle disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
Water shortages also affected those who lived in two turn-of-the-century 
utopian societies along the forest's borders: Los Terrenitos, which predated 
Tujunga, and Llano del Rio, a socialist community in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Set at the edge of a vast continent, California has given rise to a restless 
search for new beginnings and perfection amid the region's unique environment," 
Headley wrote in a discussion of these communities, which by World War I had 
lost their utopian identities. 
</P>
<P>
He is also exploring the stories of people who shaped Los Angeles and the 
development of the Angeles. Prominent among these is Benjamin D. Wilson -- Mt. 
Wilson is named for him. He was an early Los Angeles mayor and the maternal 
grandfather of World War II hero Gen. George S. Patton Jr. 
</P>
<P>
And he is probing the scientific role of Mt. Wilson as a leading astronomical 
observatory site and how the San Dimas Experimental Forest in the Angeles has 
led the way in research on such topics as the effects of forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
The forest's past has provided a rich lode of disastrous happenings, including 
a 1900 fire known as the Big Fire, which burned for three months and destroyed 
22,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
And the Great Flood of 1938, he said, killed 88 people. One hundred and 
twenty-seven more were never found. 
</P>
<P>
In his research, Headley has come across some poignant passages. One, recorded 
in a guest book from the San Gabriel River fishing camp of prominent Los 
Angeles attorney H. W. O'Melveny, was written in 1923 by George S. Patton, 
father of the general. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw this canyon first in 1868, when, as a boy of 12, I . . . caught my fill 
of big fish along the lonely stretches of virgin solitude," Patton wrote. "That 
was 55 years ago, and today as I walked alone in the same joyous silence, I 
experienced a deep sense of gratitude. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Musing about this exceptional sylvan retreat and the woods around it, Patton 
urged, "May God guide our footsteps aright." And he wondered: "What of the 
future? The world is in dire distress. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, with the advent of flood control and hydroelectric power on 
the San Gabriel River, the Morris Dam flooded the land where the O'Melveny 
cabin stood. 
</P>
<P>
"These men hoped to have a balance between urban life and nature," Headley 
said. "But as time has gone on, the urban has taken over. Today we're possibly 
at a point of no return."

THE STORY OF THE LOST LIBRARY; 
</P>
<P>
NIXON: WHITTIER FAILED THREE TIMES ON BIDS TO BUILD A REPOSITORY FOR THE 
RESIGNED PRESIDENT'S ARCHIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nestled in the Whittier Hills sits a ridge-top plateau of pristine, prime real 
estate with a view of the Pacific on a clear day. The city of Whittier first 
sought to make this the home of a Nixon library more than two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
And again seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And four more years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But today, the champagne toasting the dedication of the $21-million library 
flows in Yorba Linda, Nixon's birthplace and now-chosen resting place for the 
former President's selected archives. 
</P>
<P>
"We were terribly shocked," former Whittier Mayor Victor Lopez said recently of 
Nixon's decision to locate his private library elsewhere. "It would have been a 
boost to Whittier, Whittier College and the whole thing. We were terribly 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Chandler, another of the city's former mayors, added: "We always figured 
that Whittier was his home." 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to understand Whittier's claim to the 37th President. Although 
Richard M. Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, it was in Whittier that he spent his 
high school and college years. He met his wife in Whittier and practiced law 
here. And Whittier Republicans helped him start his political career, a 
successful bid to unseat Democratic incumbent Jerry Voorhis in a congressional 
district that encompassed the city and nearby communities. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon entered Whittier as a child; he left it as a figure in national politics. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we had a complete inside track historically," Chandler said, "with 
Whittier representing most of his life. It wasn't to be." 
</P>
<P>
Whittier's first effort to claim the library began shortly after Nixon's 1968 
presidential triumph over Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. Whittier College 
helped to lead the bid for the library, which enjoyed strong community support. 
</P>
<P>
"His presidency was important at the time to the college," said Joseph 
Dmohowski, special collections librarian at Whittier College. "It attracted a 
lot of students to the college." 
</P>
<P>
The city presented the then-President with a handsome, oversize, leather-bound 
and cloth-lined tome titled "The Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library, 
Whittier, California." It contained pictorial highlights of Whittier and 
Nixon's career, intimately connecting the two on thick cardboard pages. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a great honor to see your presidential library standing on that 
Whittier hilltop, purchased with hopes just as high," wrote then-Mayor Keith 
Miller and Frederick Binder, who was Whittier College's president. 
</P>
<P>
Local Nixon friends and supporters also commissioned "The Nixon Trail: A Site 
Feasibility Study for the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library." 
</P>
<P>
Prepared by a prestigious architectural firm, the study contained a picture of 
a three-dimensional rendering of the library, which was envisioned sitting on a 
ridge among 120 acres of Whittier hillside -- above where the city's landfill 
is now located. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed complex consisted of two sets of concentric circles terraced down 
the hillside. There were also artists' conceptions of the library interior. The 
central gallery would feature NASA rockets and space capsules, which at the 
time is what the artists guessed would be remembered about Nixon's 
Administration. Indeed, the library study was submitted shortly after the first 
moon landing in December, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the study's authors proposed a historical trail winding through 
Whittier that included stops at the site of the favorite son's old law firm 
(Wingert, Bewley &amp; Nixon), three schools he attended, four former Nixon 
residences, the site of his father's store, the Quaker church and the location 
of his wedding reception. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, everything was on course. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
Although most Whittier residents remained sympathetic to Nixon, the impetus for 
the library literally dissolved as the scandal forced Nixon's resignation in 
August, 1974. Choosing a location for his archives became a low priority. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no discussion of the library for a long time after he left office," 
said Bruce Martin, executive manager of the Whittier Chamber of Commerce. "The 
trials were still going on. I think everything went on hold." 
</P>
<P>
"Had it not been for Watergate, (the library) would have been here," said Clint 
Harris, a lifelong Nixon friend and Whittier resident who used to scrimmage 
head to head with the future President on the Whittier College football team. 
</P>
<P>
By 1983, with Watergate nearly a decade in the past, interest in the library 
had resurfaced and several cities and universities were active competitors for 
it. Duke University (where Nixon attended law school) and UC Irvine were 
eliminated, in part because of faculty and student opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier, though, was a finalist for the site, along with Yorba Linda and San 
Clemente, which was the location of Nixon's Western White House. This time, 
Whittier's offer had shrunk to 20 acres, but it included the same spectacular 
ridge. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez remembered attending a dinner party at the home of local Nixon boosters 
Ed and Ruth Shannon. Nixon's representatives were there, along with most of the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a gorgeous evening," Lopez said. "The hills we were overlooking, that 
was the Nixon site. We talked financing and so forth. We were willing to put in 
the road, sewage, water and to give them the land. It was all positive. They 
liked the site, the view and the town. 
</P>
<P>
"When they left that evening, they said, 'It looks pretty good to us.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the very next day's paper, Lopez said, he learned that San Clemente had been 
selected. In her personal files, Ruth Shannon said, she has a letter from Nixon 
describing his vacillation and agonizing. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'If I followed my heart, it would go to Whittier.' He felt it should 
be at San Clemente because of his years at the White House," Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, however, an unexpected problem had thwarted the San Clemente plans, 
and the search for a library site was on again. Whittier officials began their 
third and final bid for it. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the city wooed Nixon representatives by pitching a tent and a 
display at the proposed site, Chandler said. But for the most part, the 
lobbying went on behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
City officials "were trying to keep this low key because we'd been disappointed 
twice before," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
And once again, it was not to be. In fact, Yorba Linda's city manager recently 
confessed that his city had an inside track after the San Clemente deal fell 
through. "They came to us and asked if we were interested," Arthur C. Simonian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It helped that the city already had preserved Nixon's birthplace as a historic 
site and could offer an adjacent land parcel for the library. 
</P>
<P>
So Yorba Linda, a sleepy Orange County suburb, is looking forward to an 
estimated 350,000 library visitors a year and the tourist dollars they will 
leave behind. Whittier, a city still trying to rebuild from the October, 1987, 
earthquake, will sorely miss the income and the prestige, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Nixon's close friends and supporters from Whittier were treated to 
sneak previews of the shrine to the former President. Almost to a person, they 
loved everything -- save for its address. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're happy for Yorba Linda. They did a great job," Martin said 
diplomatically. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Whittier Chamber of Commerce is already at work on Plan B, a 
revival of the Nixon trail idea. Martin figures that some library visitors 
would venture a side trip to Whittier. Perhaps they'll even stay at the local 
Hilton. He's sure the chamber could arrange for shuttle service from Whittier 
to the library. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said, "We're trying to take a positive approach to the whole thing."

POMONA STARTS SEARCH FOR NEW FIRE CHIEF; 
</P>
<P>
PERSONNEL: THE EMBATTLED FORMER CHIEF BECOMES A 'FIRE SAFETY OFFICER' AND WILL 
RECEIVE MORE THAN $160,000 IN SALARY AND BENEFITS.

<P>
City officials say it could take four months to find a new fire chief to 
replace Tom Fee, who has resigned in a deal that will net him more than 
$160,000 in salary and benefits over the next 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
Fee on Saturday agreed to step down after a group of dissident firefighters 
complained to the City Council about his management style and alleged 
favoritism. Fee, 48, is a 27-year veteran of the department and was appointed 
chief in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached with the City Council, Fee will be reassigned as a 
"fire safety officer" and will receive the same benefits and salary -- $89,932 
a year -- as when he was chief. Fee's accrued sick days, executive leave and 
vacation time -- totaling 1,950 hours -- will make up much of the 14 months. 
Based on an eight-hour day, the accrued leave time equals about eight months. 
Fee will retire with maximum benefits on his 50th birthday in October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
As a fire safety officer, Fee will be a consultant to the new fire chief. But 
unless his input is requested, he is barred from any professional contact with 
department employees, the agreement stipulates. 
</P>
<P>
"It just comes down to, 'OK, we'll help you out on this and let you stay on 
staff' " until you retire, City Finance Director Elray Konkle said. 
</P>
<P>
Fee did not return several phone calls made to his office and paging service. 
</P>
<P>
The move to dismiss Fee began last week when disgruntled firefighters gave the 
City Council a petition signed by 76 of the department's 119 firefighters, 
asking for his ouster. They also reportedly wrote a letter outlining specific 
complaints against Fee. Had he not resigned, the letter was to have been made 
public by the firefighters, Mayor Donna Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters who organized the action would not confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 firefighters on hand at Saturday's emergency meeting of the City 
Council cheered when the resignation was unanimously accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Then the council voted 3 to 1 to approve terms of the contract settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Smith cast the lone vote against the settlement. She said the arrangement is 
unfair to other city employees who were let go without similar compromises. 
</P>
<P>
"I am just emphatically against the way the agreement was struck," Smith said. 
"If we were to treat Mr. Fee in the same manner we had other employees . . . we 
could have been looking at somewhere around $75,000 (to settle.)" 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Fee's buyout will cost Pomona about $164,000, Smith said. Konkle 
confirmed the figure. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Nell Soto said the financial settlement was just compensation for 
a man unfairly ousted from his job. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her vote to approve the settlement, Soto said she fears that the 
council has set a bad precedent for future management-employee conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
"What if staff comes up and asks for the resignation of (another) 
administrator? Are we going to acquiesce to the demands of staff?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and others said Fee's release was appropriate in light of the complaints 
against him. Councilman Tomas Ursua said that because of the widespread 
sentiment against Fee in the Fire Department, the city was forced to act. 
</P>
<P>
It was "something that we absolutely had to do," Ursua said. "We really 
couldn't allow the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
But Smith, Ursua, City Administrator Julio Fuentes and members of the Fireman's 
Assn. refused to specify complaints against Fee. 
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to keep that confidential," Fuentes said. Under terms of the 
settlement, city officials may not "defame" Fee. 
</P>
<P>
Fee's resignation is seen by some as a logical follow-up to the June recall of 
City Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant. Bryant, ousted by a vote of 8,519 to 
4,158, was targeted because of what recall organizers saw as his abrasive 
manner and disrespect for co-workers. Bryant was viewed as a council ally of 
Fee's. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that this is (part of) the healing process started with the recall," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
For six months last year, Fee served in the dual role of fire chief and city 
administrator. While in the latter role, he carried out a City Council decision 
to fire the police chief. Relations between the Police and Fire departments 
have been strained since. 
</P>
<P>
Until Lloyd Wood was sworn in as Pomona's police chief Monday, that department 
was without a permanent chief for nine months. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes said it should not take that long to replace Fee. 
</P>
<P>
A recruitment process will begin shortly, Fuentes said, adding that he hopes a 
replacement will be found within three or four months. 
</P>
<P>
Until a full-time replacement can be found, Fuentes said, the Fire Department 
will be run by two division managers, one for administration and one for daily 
operations.

REGAL CANYON ROAD WORK

<TEXT>
<P>
Complaining that neighborhood safety is being compromised by an absence of 
sidewalks, a group of Walnut residents have persuaded the City Council to fund 
the improvement along Regal Canyon Road south of Amar Road. 
</P>
<P>
The residents, who appeared before the council last week, cited a traffic study 
that showed that 479 vehicles pass along the road each day. They argued that 
children can't ride their bicycles along the winding road without peril and 
that pedestrians are at risk of being hit by vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Before unanimously approving the construction of sidewalks at a maximum cost of 
$20,000, the council asked city staff to determine how many other streets lack 
sidewalks and to define the city's responsibility in installing them.

CHP Officer Houston Currie told the Town Council on Tuesday that the department 
will launch an Explorer Program in September as a means of getting new 
recruits. 
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to train 16- to 21-year-olds, male or female, in office 
and field procedures. The 15 applicants selected will serve on a volunteer 
basis after a week at the CHP Training Academy in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officials say they hope that the explorers will eventually sign up as 
members of the department. 
</P>
<P>
Interested residents should contact the CHP's Altadena Patrol Office.

<P>
APPEAL FOR BIG HOUSE DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appeal to build what would have been one of the largest homes in La Verne 
was rejected by the City Council on Monday. The council decided that an 
11,000-square-foot house -- with 13 bedrooms, 13 bathrooms and five two-car 
garages -- would be incompatible with the 2,500- to 3,000-square-foot homes in 
the foothills neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
A contingent of neighbors spoke against the size of the proposed house at 5050 
Emerald Ave., using such terms as "condominium" and "Ramada Inn" to describe 
it. They also questioned whether it would be used for just one family. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Wildish, attorney for applicant Janet Lopez, acknowledged that the house is 
big but noted that it is on a 4.2-acre lot, far larger than the neighbors' 
lots, and that trees would partially screen it from view. The house would be 
occupied by seven people, he said, and the rest of the bedrooms would be used 
by temporary family guests. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council rejected the project as incompatible with the 
neighborhood.

Under the Enterprise Zone concept, businesses locating within a selected area

HIRING PROGRAM FOR PASADENANS ADOPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "First Source Agreement," requiring developers in Pasadena to provide jobs 
for city residents first before considering non-residents, was approved Tuesday 
by the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The board also approved spending $48,756 to implement and administer the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was devised to comply with the Growth Management Initiative 
passed by voters last year. 
</P>
<P>
The policy was initially opposed by the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce and 
Jurgensen's grocery store, which thought that it was unconstitutional and 
overly burdensome to developers and employers. They withdrew their objections 
after the policy was revised.

Multiple choice question: Is this parking structure 
</P>
<P>
(a) three stories? 
</P>
<P>
(b) four stories? 
</P>
<P>
(c) five stories? 
</P>
<P>
(d) one continuous spiral? 
</P>
<P>
(e) a case for the Los Angeles County Grand Jury? 
</P>
<P>
City officials pick "e" and are drafting a letter they hope will persuade the 
grand jury to resolve the matter once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
Some irate residents near the Garfield Medical Center's parking structure count 
five stories, and say it violates the city's three-story maximum for that area. 
The height limits are part of Proposition A, which was passed by voters in 
October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, who approved construction of the 40-foot-high parking lot last 
year, say it is legal because it is a parking structure, not a commercial 
building, and is exempt from the three-story provision. 
</P>
<P>
The structure "actually consists of one large spiral," attorney Stephanie R. 
Scher wrote last year in a memo to City Manager Mark Lewis. Scher is with the 
Los Angeles law firm Brown, Winfield &amp; Canzoneri, which provides legal 
services for Monterey Park. "Because of the spiral structure of the floors of 
the parking structure, it would be impossible to apply the definition of story 
as found in the Municipal Code." 
</P>
<P>
But a handful of residents still are not satisfied, and have accused the city 
and medical center of using semantics to defend an illegal project. Week after 
week, they have shown up at City Council meetings to complain that the parking 
structure has generated more traffic, crime and gang activity in their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a play on words," said Robert Lujan, who lives near the hospital. 
"It's ridiculous to say, 'These things are ramps and we can't tell how many 
stories there are.' " 
</P>
<P>
So, last week, the City Council, at Mayor Judy Chu's request, decided to ask 
the grand jury for a second opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"We are at a complete stalemate with nobody to arbitrate," Chu said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Grand jury officials could not be reached for comment on whether they will take 
the case.

ABUSED CHILDREN'S PROGRAM LOSES FUNDING CUT APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foothill Family Service, a 64-year-old Pasadena agency that operates a 
counseling program for sexually abused children, lost an appeal Tuesday in 
Sacramento for restoration of $123,000 in state-administered funds. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill, which serves nearly 1,000 abused children each year, had for the last 
three years received more than $100,000 annually in federal funds through the 
state Office of Criminal Justice Planning. 
</P>
<P>
The agency was not among 12 programs selected for another three years of 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
"The de-funding is occurring at a bad time," Foothill Executive Director David 
Eisenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss represents about half of the agency's $250,000 annual budget for the 
sexual abuse counseling program, he said.

THOMPSON GETS ALL-STAR CHANCE; 
</P>
<P>
PREPS: BASSETT HIGH STANDOUT IS SHUNNED BY SHRINE GAME, BUT WILL SHOW HIS STUFF 
IN HALL OF FAME GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
From the first day of football practice last year, Marshawn Thompson was 
focused on playing in the Shrine All-Star Football Game. 
</P>
<P>
By season's end, Thompson had more than 2,000 reasons to feel he'd get a bid. 
</P>
<P>
He finished his senior year at Bassett High in La Puente as the leading rusher 
in the state with 2,294 yards and 30 touchdowns in 379 carries, one of the 
highest single-season yardage and touchdown totals in CIF Southern Section 
history. 
</P>
<P>
But all that it got him was a nomination for the South team in January along 
with 119 other players. And when the 32-player squad was announced in early 
March, Thompson's name was not on the list. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand how a guy who rushed for 2,300 yards and 30 touchdowns and 
led the state in rushing cannot make the Shrine Game," Thompson said. "Maybe 
they didn't think I was good enough for some reason or maybe it was because I'm 
from Bassett. I don't know why they didn't pick me. I just can't understand 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Bassett has never had a player selected for the Shrine Game. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was listed as an alternate and that didn't set well with him. 
</P>
<P>
"They announced the team and I wasn't on it and then when they sent me the 
alternate papers it really hurt," he said. . . . "I just threw them out. That 
was it for me. I didn't want to be an alternate." 
</P>
<P>
Local fans will still get a chance to see Thompson in action. He received and 
accepted an invitation to play in the 11th annual Hall of Fame Game. 
</P>
<P>
The game, at 8 p.m. Friday at Citrus College in Glendora, will feature many of 
the top players in the San Gabriel Valley. The East team, which includes 
Thompson, also features offensive tackle Norberto Garrido of Workman, 
quarterback J. J. O'Laughlin of Glendora, fullback Marcus Green of Northview 
and defensive tackle Mike Collins of Los Altos. The West is headed by Muir 
standouts Reggie Hunt at nose guard, Paul Joiner at linebacker and defensive 
backs Sam Williford and Stephan Crutchfield. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second all-star game of the summer for the 6-foot-1, 200-pound 
Thompson, who also competed in the California vs. Oklahoma All-Star Game in 
June in Honolulu. The California team, which won, 35-26, consisted primarily of 
Valley players including 10 who will play Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who runs the 40-yard dash in 4.5 seconds, did not carry the ball as 
much as usual in the game but still enjoyed the Hawaiian experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great experience," he said. "It was my first trip to Hawaii and it 
was a lot of fun. We had Richard Robles (of Baldwin Park High) as our 
quarterback and we passed the ball a lot. I didn't get the ball much but it was 
fun just watching them throw." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson insists he is not out to prove anything to the people who selected the 
Shrine team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not using the game to prove that I should've been in the Shrine Game," he 
said. "I'm just going out to have fun and play a good game." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said there are other players on his East squad who could play in the 
Shrine Game. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of guys on this Hall of Fame team that I think can play in the 
Shrine Game and they got passed up, too," he said. "I can think of at least 
eight." 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, he adds, there are a lot of players who went on to outstanding 
college or pro careers after being passed up for the Shrine Game. He mentioned 
</P>
<P>
former Muir running back Ricky Ervins, who stars for USC and will be honorary 
chairman of the Hall of Fame Game. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said participating in the Hall of Fame Game has helped ease the pain 
of not being selected to the Shrine Game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still hard to get out of my mind but playing with the talent in this Hall 
of Fame Game is real helpful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Thompson, being passed up for the Shrine Game was not the only 
disappointment he has faced since the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
With his success over the past two years, Thompson had been regarded as one of 
the top college prospects in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But then he barely missed reaching the minimum score of 700 on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test and fell short twice, by two and three points, on the American 
College Test entrance examinations. That would have left him ineligible, under 
the NCAA's Proposition 48 guidelines, to play for a Division I program as a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Before colleges learned about his test results, Thompson had been recruited by 
Division I schools such as USC and Colorado. Even after his test difficulties 
emerged, Thompson was still being recruited by Fresno State and Oregon -- two 
Division I bowl teams from last season. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Utah was the only school willing to offer him a scholarship whether 
or not he passed his entrance exam but Thompson admits he wasn't excited about 
the prospect of playing for the Utes. So, instead of attending Utah and having 
to sit out a season, he has opted to play at Pasadena City College for two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Utah offered me a scholarship but I'd have to sit out a year and I didn't want 
to do that," he said. "I just decided it was better for me to go to a JC and I 
decided it would be Pasadena City College. I'll go to Pasadena City College and 
then go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Thompson is already on the way toward reaching his goal of graduating 
from PCC six months early and then transferring to a top four-year program. He 
has been taking summer school classes at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to wait 1 1/2 years longer but it's what I have to do," Thompson 
said. "I didn't want to accept it at first but now I know I will just have to 
wait a little longer to get where I want." 
</P>
<P>
Nor did Thompson want to accept the fact that he wasn't selected to the Shrine 
team. But he says he has learned to remain upbeat despite his disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never gotten down or anything like that," he said. "I always thought that 
you don't get anything for free in life, anyway. Now I just have to work a 
little harder and take it from there."

3 ARRESTED IN SWAP MEET KILLING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three suspects in the fatal shooting of a security guard at the San Fernando 
Swap Meet last month were charged with murder and robbery, authorities said 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Roldan, 19, of Pacoima, Richard Zorns, 22, of Arleta, and a 17-year-old 
Pacoima boy were charged with the June 3 death of Roland (Lucky) Teal, 61, of 
Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
Teal, a father of nine and a guard at the swap meet on Glenoaks Boulevard for 
nearly 20 years, was gunned down shortly after three men took $12,000 from the 
manager at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
After the robbery, several bystanders chased the suspects. Police said Teal 
grabbed the unarmed juvenile and was holding him when Roldan allegedly came up 
from behind and shot the guard in the back, killing him. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Rico Castro said today that detectives reviewed other robberies of area 
swap meets and found similarities between the June 3 case and one in 1988 in 
Sunland. Roldan had been arrested in the 1988 case and was on trial at the time 
of the June robbery, but he was free on bail during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives gathered evidence linking him and his two friends to the June 
robbery and shooting, and they were arrested this week. All three were 
described by police as associates of local gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig R. Richman said he will seek the death penalty against 
Roldan because he is suspected of firing the shot that killed Teal.

Six Army soldiers who deserted their military intelligence post in West Germany 
and were arrested in Florida told other soldiers they were leaving to find and 
destroy the "anti-Christ," it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The European edition of the military newspaper Stars and Stripes, citing Army 
sources, said the six soldiers destroyed or gave away all of their personal 
belongings before leaving their 701st Military Intelligence Brigade in 
Augsburg, West Germany, earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The deserters, who were arrested last Friday and Saturday in the Pensacola area 
and are now being held at Ft. Benning, Ga., told fellow soldiers before they 
left that they were going to find and "destroy the anti-Christ" who was 
believed to be in the Pensacola area, the Stars and Stripes said. 
</P>
<P>
The six soldiers were trained as cryptographers. The Army is trying to 
determine if the six were involved in espionage.

Argentina complained at the 40-nation disarmament conference today that the 
developed nations have generally ignored a 1975 treaty calling for notification 
of objects launched into space. 
</P>
<P>
It called for stricter wording and monitoring of implementation of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"The flow of information as a result of the convention has proved to be scanty, 
incomplete and tardy," Argentina representative Roberto Garcia Moritan said. 
</P>
<P>
A shortcoming of the 1975 agreement, he said, is that information by launching 
nations was to be provided only "as soon as practicable." 
</P>
<P>
"Thus the absurd situation was reached that for many years not a single 
military-type mission was reported although . . . the majority of activities in 
outer space are directly or indirectly associated with operations of a military 
nature," he said.

A double-decker bus carrying 58 American teen-agers at Oxford University 
overturned on a highway today, killing at least one student and seriously 
injuring 32, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four others suffered lesser injuries, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The American students, all about 16 years old, were taking a summer school 
course at the university's Magdalen College. None of the victims were 
immediately identified. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxford Advanced Studies Program in New York organized the summer course for 
gifted students from all over the United States, its U.S. coordinator said. He 
said most were about to enter their senior year in high school. 
</P>
<P>
Those seriously hurt were rushed on stretchers to the John Radcliffe Hospital 
in Oxford. The 24 others, described as "walking wounded," were taken to Wycombe 
General Hospital in nearby High Wycombe. 
</P>
<P>
The British driver of the chartered bus survived the crash but it was not known 
if he was injured. The accident involved a truck, but no further details were 
immediately available, Chief Inspector Laurie Fray said.

CONVICTED SPY FOR ISRAEL FILES FOR DIVORCE;

Jonathan Pollard, the former Navy intelligence specialist imprisoned for life 
for spying for Israel, has filed for divorce from his wife, who served three 
years in prison as an accessory to his crimes, her lawyer said today. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Baker, attorney for Anne Henderson Pollard, 30, said his client was served 
with divorce papers in her bed at Mount Sinai Hospital on Wednesday by a man 
who posed as a hospital employee to gain entry to her room. Pollard has been a 
patient at the hospital for treatment of a chronic gastrointestinal condition, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's in a state of shock," Baker said. "The papers served her cite 
irreconcilable differences between her and her husband, whom she hasn't seen 
for 3 1/2 years and hasn't talked to on the phone for four months. There's been 
almost no contact, so how could there be irreconcilable differences?" 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Pollard had not made up her mind whether to contest the suit and 
will concentrate her efforts on going to Israel to get medical treatment. He 
described her as destitute and said an insurance company in Israel has offered 
to pay her medical costs there. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Pollard, 34, is in solitary confinement at the maximum security prison 
in Marion, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife had been married for only four months and were living in 
Washington when he was charged with turning over top-secret documents to the 
Israelis in return for money to finance a lavish lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
His wife was not implicated directly in the spy charges on which her husband 
was convicted but tried to help him flee the country and destroy documents. She 
pleaded guilty to accessory charges in the hope that it would help her husband 
get a more lenient sentence, her lawyer said. She served a three-year prison 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Pollard was released March 31 from a halfway house.

The nation's third-largest computer company blamed the results in part on weak

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. today reported its second-quarter 
earnings fell 6.4% due to lower equipment sales and unexpectedly high start-up 
costs for the company's new credit card. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T said it earned $657 million, or 60 cents a share, in the quarter ended 
June 30, down from $699 million, or 65 cents a share, in the same quarter of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue also fell, to $9.03 billion from $9.26 billion in the same quarter of 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the disappointing results were due mostly to slower sales of 
corporate telephone systems, data communications gear and equipment sold to the 
federal government, as well as unexpectedly high costs for processing 
applications for its Universal card, which combines a MasterCard or Visa with 
telephone charging privileges.

STC PLC, the parent company of Britain's biggest computer maker, today said it 
is negotiating the sale of a majority stake in its computer arm to Japan's 
leading computer manufacturer, Fujitsu Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Such a stake in the subsidiary International Computers Ltd., or ICL, would give 
Fujitsu a major foothold in Europe ahead of the creation of the single European 
market in 1992, while offering ICL security for the future, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
STC, formerly known as Standard Telephones &amp; Cables, confirmed the 
negotiations after Fujitsu President Tadashi Sekizawa said earlier in Tokyo 
that his company is considering purchasing an interest in ICL but that "nothing 
has been decided yet." 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports in Britain and Japan have said Fujitsu would acquire 50% to 
60% of ICL's equity for about $1.2 billion.

MIRACLE'S OVER: DUKAKIS SIGNS TAX HIKE BILL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who bragged about the "Massachusetts Miracle" during 
his failed presidential bid, has signed a bill taxing myriad services to infuse 
the state with needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis signed the bill Wednesday behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not something to celebrate," he said later. 
</P>
<P>
"Taxes are like medicine," he said. "Nobody likes to prescribe them. Nobody 
likes to take them. But taxes are part of what will be required to regain 
fiscal health in the state." 
</P>
<P>
The measure raises state income and gasoline taxes and extends the 5% sales tax 
to hundreds of business services that were previously exempt. The new law is 
expected to generate $1.2 billion this fiscal year and an additional $1.8 
billion next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said residents will start feeling the effects of the law at the 
gasoline pump within 10 days and will start seeing a bigger bite out of their 
paychecks as early as three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The huge tax boost marks another chapter in the up-and-down fortunes of Dukakis 
and Massachusetts. Two years ago, Dukakis was preparing to accept the 
Democratic nomination for the presidency as he bragged about the "Massachusetts 
Miracle." 
</P>
<P>
But since then, the economy has soured, revenue has shrunk, and state 
government has run up a deficit of more than $1 billion for last fiscal year. 
Massachusetts' bond ratings have plummeted to the lowest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The only miracle that I can see is that working men and women up to this time 
have been able to keep their heads above water," said House Minority Leader 
Steven Pierce, the Republican candidate for governor. He said he will file 
legislation to repeal the tax package. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis is not seeking reelection.

TBS COVERAGE OF GOODWILL GAMES TO BEGIN TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cable mogul Ted Turner, whose TBS channel today begins 86 hours of coverage of 
the Goodwill Games, calls the 17-day sports extravaganza "cable television's 
largest original programming event ever." But about 17% of the 54 million cable 
households that receive TBS -- roughly nine million homes -- won't have the 
opportunity to watch it. 
</P>
<P>
That's because many cable operators declined to pay a surcharge of between 90 
cents and $1.10 per customer assesed by Turner to carry the Goodwill Games. The 
Olympics-style event, taking place in Seattle and six other Washington state 
cities, features more than 2,500 of the world's best athletes from more than 50 
nations competing in 21 sports. 
</P>
<P>
TBS officials said that about 95% of their Southern California viewers will see 
the Goodwill Games. They were unable to specify the local systems that will not 
be carrying the event, and a random sampling of cable operators contacted by 
The Times found none that had refused to pay the extra fee. 
</P>
<P>
The cable systems that did opt against the Goodwill Games will get alternate 
programming from TBS, consisting of old movies. 
</P>
<P>
Turner is charging extra for the games in an effort to cut his losses. Turner 
said that cable companies will pay $38 million for the games and figures this 
year's losses to be at least $10 million on a $180-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
Turner Broadcasting puts the loss for the inaugural Goodwill Games, held in 
Moscow in 1986, at $24 million. Turner's plans were far more ambitious then, 
with 129 hours of coverage, and rights were also sold to broadcast stations 
throughout the nation, overexposing a product that had a limited audience in 
the first place. Stations in Boston, Washington, Detroit and Chicago reported 
ratings of less than 1% for Sunday telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
Turner conceived the Goodwill Games in 1984 as an effort to decrease tensions 
between the Soviet Union and the United States.

THE WALL RETURNS TO BERLIN, BUT THIS ONE IS PINK FLOYD'S VERSION

<P>
The Wall is back in Berlin -- not the concrete barrier that divided the city 
for 28 years but the rock extravaganza by Pink Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of musicians, actors and even Soviet and British soldiers will perform 
"The Wall" on Saturday at a bizarre venue -- the former death strip where 
border guards once had orders to open fire on East Germans trying to flee to 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
The acclaimed rock opera by Pink Floyd's former leader, Roger Waters, will be 
performed on a grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's ever thought about doing a concert between two countries in a 
prohibited military zone, as this area still was when we started planning," 
producer Mick Worwood said. "We've created a city here." 
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people will attend the $8-million concert featuring a 
symphony orchestra, Soviet and British military helicopters, a Soviet army 
marching band, Hells Angels motorcycle riders, Waters' new group The Bleeding 
Hearts and a clutch of guest musicians including folk-rock singers Joni 
Mitchell and Van Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
The 200-foot-high stage near the Brandenburg Gate has dominated Berlin's 
skyline for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Few traces remain at the site of the Berlin Wall, opened last November and 
since mostly demolished. But the set includes a wall of its own, made from 
2,000 white polystyrene blocks, as a backdrop to the tale of rebellion against 
authority and alienation told by the music. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's concert is the most elaborate of several events planned this summer 
to celebrate the end of the Cold War division of Berlin.

LIZ SMITH: DOUGLAS GETTING $15 MILLION FOR 'BASIC INSTINCT' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MICHAEL DOUGLAS is going to have more than the usual incentive to do his very 
best work when his next movie, Carolco's "Basic Instinct," begins filming in 
February. About $15 million worth of incentive! 
</P>
<P>
Yes, that is what Douglas will be paid for the sexual thriller, and it is 
reported to be a record salary for a non-sequel (Sylvester Stallone is said to 
have collected more than $20 million for one of his "Rambo" films). 
</P>
<P>
And let's not forget that Douglas' eight-figure salary is on top of the huge 
amount collected by "Basic Instinct" screenwriter Joe Eszterhas. This was 
another record, industry insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
"Basic Instinct" is to be directed by Paul Verhoeven. We haven't heard what 
he'll be paid, but you can be sure that the success of his "Total Recall," 
still cleaning up at the box office, is insurance enough that he won't be 
working for peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
SONIA BRAGA, the great Brazilian beauty of "The Milagro Beanfield War," "Kiss 
of The Spider Woman," "Moon Over Parador" and countless films in her own 
country, where she is a mucho big star, has just completed "The Rookie" with 
Clint Eastwood, Raul Julia and Charlie Sheen. Braga had some reservations at 
first about taking the part, as "The Rookie' is another one of those young 
cop/old cop shoot-'em-up-and-let-them-die-in-the-streets movies. But she got 
over that and soon found the make-believe violence enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
Braga also has a stunning American Express print ad coming out soon. The 
actress is pictured on the desert sands, alone and wind-swept, wearing a tight 
white dress of tissue paper consistency. Sonia Braga, she never leaves home 
without it. And even if she does, she'll get by. 
</P>
<P>
IT WAS supposed to have been Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid in Paramount's 
"Butcher's Wife." But now two of this summer's hot stars, Demi Moore and Jeff 
Daniels ("Ghost" and "Arachnophobia") will portray the Outer Banks, North 
Carolina, girl and the Greenwich Village butcher. 
</P>
<P>
P.S. Late last week we tried to confirm (or get someone to deny) the rumor that 
Dennis Quaid had admitted himself to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica for 
detox. The actor's press representatives said they'd get back to us. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Quaid's publicist, Susan Geller, absolutely denied that Dennis is 
now, or has ever been in St. John's. So that's the official word, despite what 
you read in this week's tabloids about Dennis and his drinking.

At 22, with Olympic gold behind her, gymnastics has finally become fun for Mary 
Lou Retton. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I perform, I don't compete and that makes a real difference," Retton said. 
</P>
<P>
Retton was the sensation of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Her gold 
medal, in the all-around competition, was the first ever for an American woman 
gymnast. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were practicing for the Olympics, we spent eight hours a day in the 
gym," she said Monday. "The time in between practice, we were too tired to do 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to be successful you give up your social life. You give up 
everything except gymnastics," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Retton performs six to eight times a year, travels as a motivational 
speaker and does charity work. She also is engaged to be married in December.

Boston Celtics center Robert Parish, the oldest starter in the NBA, says the 
Seattle SuperSonics are trying to acquire him, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
"I did talk to K. C. Jones and he told me that they are trying to get me," The 
Union Leader newspaper quoted Parish as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, now Seattle's coach, formerly coached the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Parish said trading him would be a mistake because the Celtics "wouldn't have a 
legitimate center." 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Kleine is not a legitimate center in the sense that he is not a shot 
blocker and not an intimidator," he was quoted as saying. "He's not a force on 
the offensive end." 
</P>
<P>
Parish, 36, acknowledged that Kleine is the best backup he's had since Bill 
Walton in 1986. But if the Celtics trade him, Parish believes no one on the 
roster could replace him. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin McHale is capable, but he'd be playing out of position," Parish said.

Cleveland State University fired basketball Coach Kevin Mackey today, two days 
after he admitted to a cocaine and alcohol problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I fired Kevin Mackey, but really he fired himself," university President John 
Flower said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Flower said Mackey's behavior had "made a mockery" of ethical and moral 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey was arrested Friday night as he drove away from a reputed drug house. A 
urine test showed he had .20 of a gram of alcohol per 100 milliliters of urine, 
above the legal limit of 0.14 of a gram. The test also showed some cocaine in 
his system. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Tuesday, Mackey called his problems with drugs and 
drinking a "descent into hell." 
</P>
<P>
He has pleaded innocent to charges of driving while intoxicated, consumption of 
alcohol in a motor vehicle and violation of the open container ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey, 43, was hired as Cleveland State's head coach in 1983, after he had 
served as an assistant at Boston College since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey last week had signed a new two-year contract.

<P>
Soccer officials from East and West Germany agreed today to merge their leagues 
and form a joint national team next year. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, announced by West German Soccer Federation spokesman Wolfgang 
Niersbach, means that one German team will compete in the 1992 Olympics and 
European Championship. 
</P>
<P>
In 1994, one German team will defend the World Cup title West Germany won in 
Italy earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
East German soccer players will be eligible for the joint national team 
beginning in 1991, Niersbach said. He said East German teams will withdraw 
immediately from European international competitions but that club teams will 
not withdraw until the 1990-91 European Cups finish next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with the 1991-92 season, the West German first division will be 
expanded to 20 clubs to include the top two East German teams this season. The 
second division will accept six East German clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The soccer union was moved forward by one year to reflect the quickening pace 
of political unification that is expected to be completed in December. Earlier 
plans had called for the soccer merger to come in 1992.

Resolutions beat out 25 quarter horses to emerge as the leading qualifier from 
trials Wednesday night at Los Alamitos for the upcoming $250,000 Denim N 
Diamonds Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
Kip Didericksen piloted Resolutions to a narrow decision over Kipadeucy in the 
second of three time trials Wednesday night while stepping off Los Al's 
400-yard straightaway in 19.95 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
That time stood up as the fastest of the evening, making Resolutions a strong 
pre-race favorite for the July 28 Denim N Diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
Kipadeucy, an Idaho invader supplemented to the trials for $15,000, notched the 
second-fastest qualifying time at 19.97 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Also winning their trial divisions were Kid O Dash and My Escalon.

Sports View came from off the pace to edge Golden Voyager by three-quarters of 
a length in the $37,000 allowance feature Wednesday at Hollywood Park as jockey 
Alex Solis and trainer D. Wayne Lukas scored key victories. 
</P>
<P>
For Solis, who also won the seventh race aboard favored Horsche, it was his 
51st winner of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
That put him in a tie with Laffit Pincay Jr. for third place in the rider 
standings behind leader Pat Valenzuela (55 winners) and runner-up Gary Stevens 
(52). 
</P>
<P>
For Lukas, the nation's leading money-winning trainer, it was his 21st victory 
this meeting. That places Lukas one ahead of Ron McAnally for leading trainer 
of the spring/summer meet, which has five more days. 
</P>
<P>
Sports View, owned by Beal, Cox Jr. and Lukas, battled with Golden Voyager 
through most of the long stretch before prevailing in 1:35 2/5. Stevens was the 
rider on Golden Voyager, a 6/5 favorite in the field of six. 
</P>
<P>
Oh Wow came on late to take third, a nose behind Golden Voyager. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was worth $20,350 to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
It was Sports View's second win in eight races, with three seconds. Sports View 
has now earned $59,400. 
</P>
<P>
The winner paid $6.40, 3.20 and 2.40. Golden Voyager paid $2.60 and 2.10 and Oh 
Wow was $2.80 to show. (Charts, Section C) 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally put the final touches on Arkansas Derby winner Silver 
Ending over the weekend, as plans were completed for Sunday's $200,000 Swaps 
Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked the horse a mile Sunday," said McAnally. "He went in 1:39.1, and I 
was happy with the move." 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old Silver Hawk offspring has four wins in 10 starts.

CAUTHEN DRAWS BRITISH FINE FOR LATE PULLOUT FROM RACE

American jockey Steve Cauthen was fined $1,800 today by the Jockey Club, the 
governing body of British horse racing, for pulling out of a race at the last 
minute in May. 
</P>
<P>
Cauthen refused to ride Pip Payne-trained colt Nicholas Payne at Leicester 
after he had weighed out. 
</P>
<P>
He was substituted by Richard Fox, who placed eighth in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Cauthen said after the hearing that he disagreed with the Jockey Club's 
decision and would do the same again. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was fair of the trainer to book me for that particular 
horse. There is no doubt he was a difficult ride -- everybody backed me," the 
former champion said. 
</P>
<P>
Cauthen can appeal the decision. The last time he appeared before the Jockey 
Club was in 1983, when he appealed unsuccessfully against an eight-day 
suspension for careless riding.

RUTH BROUGHT BASEBALL ROARING INTO THE '20S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventy years ago today, a first-year outfielder for the New York Yankees hit 
his 30th and 31st home runs of the 1920 season in the second game of a 
doubleheader at the Polo Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
So what? 
</P>
<P>
So, George Herman (Babe) Ruth became the first to hit 30 home runs in a season. 
In the next several weeks, he would also become the first to hit 40 and 50 home 
runs, too. 
</P>
<P>
He was on his way to a home run record that, in 1920, was almost beyond belief 
-- he would hit 54, then 59 in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
Reference points: When Ruth hit 54 in 1920, the second-highest total in 
baseball that year was 19, by George Sisler. Only one other team in the 
American League that year hit more than 44 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
When he hit his 30th homer that afternoon, it was the 138th of Ruth's career, 
making him, at 25, the all-time home run leader. Many baseball historians claim 
today that Ruth's 1920 and '21 seasons were the greatest consecutive seasons by 
any hitter in baseball history. And many even believe either season was 
superior to his more famous 1927 season. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth played in only 142 games in 1920, yet drove in 137 runs. His home run 
percentage that season was 11.8%, compared to 1927, when it was 11.1% as he hit 
60 in 151 games. 
</P>
<P>
But most impressive of all, Ruth's slugging percentages in 1920 and '21 were 
.847 and .846. Neither figure has ever been approached. In fact, a slugging 
percentage higher than .704 has been achieved only 20 times, eight by Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth has the three highest slugging percentages ever. His .772 mark for 1927 is 
No. 3. No. 4 is Lou Gehrig's .765 in 1927. Ruth and Gehrig are on the top-20 
list 11 times. The most recent player to make the top 20 was Ted Williams, who 
hit .731 in 1957 to rank 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth joined the Yankees after the 1919 season, when Boston sold him to New 
York. In his last Red Sox season, playing in 130 games, Ruth was 9-5 as a 
pitcher, and hit 29 home runs -- then a record -- and drove in 114 runs as an 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1920, no 20th-Century player had ever hit 30, 40 or 50 homers in a 
season. Only three had ever hit 20, and one was Ruth. Three late-19th Century 
players hit between 20 and 27 home runs, but some of those, it is believed, 
were inside-the-park homers, many coming in fenceless ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1920, no one had ever seen this kind of home run production. As recently 
as 1918, Ruth co-led the major leagues with 11 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
And people paid plenty to see home runs in bunches. The Yankees, who after two 
more seasons would be able to afford to build a new ballpark -- Yankee Stadium, 
a.k.a. "The House that Ruth Built" -- became the first team to draw 1 million 
fans in a season, in 1920. They drew 1,289,422, breaking the previous 
attendance mark by 380,000.

RAIDER DEAL-MAKER NAMED TO COLISEUM COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley is putting labor leader Bill Robertson, the man who 
negotiated the deal bringing the Raiders to Los Angeles from Oakland a decade 
ago, back on the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission as part of "a final push to 
keep the Raiders" playing in the city, Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation, 
AFL-CIO, declined to comment. But he had said a few months ago that he would 
not return to the commission unless he believed that the chances of a new 
Raiders deal for Los Angeles were promising. 
</P>
<P>
He will replace attorney Stanley Sanders on the commission as one of Bradley's 
two appointees to the nine-member group. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson angrily resigned from the commission Aug. 28, 1987, just a week after 
Raiders owner Al Davis announced a move to Irwindale. Robertson then called the 
Coliseum's loss of the Raiders "irreversible and terminal" and even chastised 
Bradley for not doing more to prevent it. Later, however, the Raiders' 
Irwindale deal collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The Robertson reappointment comes at a time when Oakland authorities are 
completing a scaled-down second offer to the Raiders to return to the city. On 
Tuesday night, the Oakland City Council approved the offer by a vote of 6 to 1, 
and votes are scheduled in coming weeks by the Alameda County Board of 
Supervisors and the Oakland Coliseum Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, however, have not committed themselves to accepting the Oakland 
offer, and Fabiani indicated Wednesday that Bradley believes that several 
months more may elapse before the Raiders decide between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said the hope now is that the private Coliseum managers, Spectacor 
Management Group, will reach agreement with Davis in time to allow construction 
on a massive Coliseum renovation to start at the end of the 1991 season, after 
environmental and historic preservation studies are complete. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland spokeswoman Carol McArthur said the city retains hope that Davis will 
negotiate an early end to his team's Los Angeles Coliseum contract and be 
playing in the Oakland Coliseum by this fall.

EDWARD STONE JR., VOYAGER PROJECT LEADER, TO HEAD JPL

<P>
Edward C. Stone Jr., chief scientist on the "Grand Tour" of the outer planets 
by the twin Voyager spacecraft, has been named director of the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Stone, an internationally known physicist and the vice president of Caltech, 
will succeed Lew Allen Jr., who announced earlier that he will retire. Allen, 
former chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, has agreed to stay on until 
December for a smooth transition, said Caltech President Thomas E. Everhart. 
</P>
<P>
JPL, operated by Caltech for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 
is the world leader in planetary exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Stone will retain his position as vice president for astronomical facilities 
and professor of physics at Caltech. He also will continue as chairman of the 
Board of Directors of the California Assn. for Research in Astronomy, which is 
building the world's largest telescope in Hawaii. The 10-meter Keck Telescope 
is a joint UC-Caltech project. 
</P>
<P>
"After a national search, we are excited that a man of Ed Stone's drive and 
vision is in the right place at the right time," Everhart said in announcing 
Stone's selection. He added that Stone was the unanimous first choice of "a 
distinguished search committee." 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exciting opportunity," Stone said. "This coming decade there are a lot 
of new opportunities and I'm just looking forward to providing the scientific 
leadership" at JPL. 
</P>
<P>
Stone has so many responsibilities that "a few things are going to have to give 
way," but he said his work load should ease this fall when the Keck Telescope 
passes a major milestone with the installation of its mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
As director of JPL, Stone will run a 175-acre research laboratory that he knows 
well. For 17 years he served as chief scientist on the Voyager program, one of 
the most successful expeditions in the history of space exploration. The twin 
spacecraft visited Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, sending back close-up 
photos of all four planets and their satellites. 
</P>
<P>
The lab has a number of major programs coming to fruition, although none on the 
scale of Voyager. The Galileo spacecraft is on its way to Jupiter, where it 
will spend two years sending back data on that planet and its moons. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan is nearing Venus and will map almost all of the planet's surface with 
a radar-imaging system that will pierce through the planet's dense cloud cover. 
Other missions include participation in the U.S.-European Ulysses mission to 
study the sun, scheduled for launch from the space shuttle in October, and a 
Mars reconnaissance mission set for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
All of the JPL missions use unmanned vehicles.

FEDERAL JUDICIAL DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY.

<P>
In the fall of 1966, Lourdes Baird, a church-going Hancock Park mother of 
three, enrolled in night classes at Los Angeles City College, hoping to better 
herself but fearing that "my Blue Chip stamps would fall out of my purse and 
I'd be discovered for what I was." 
</P>
<P>
That calamity never occurred, as Baird marched through LACC, UCLA and UCLA Law 
School over the next decade and, at the age of 41, passed the California Bar 
examination on her first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
She then became, in succession, a federal prosecutor, a private attorney and a 
highly lauded Los Angeles County Superior Court judge. For the last year, she 
has served in Juvenile Court, handling complicated, often wrenching custody 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 55, the silver-haired Baird is poised to take office as the new U.S. 
attorney for the Central District of California, based in Los Angeles, making 
her one of the most powerful federal prosecutors in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Baird, who will be sworn in Friday by U.S. District Judge Manuel L. Real, will 
be the chief federal prosecutor for seven Southern California counties, 
spanning an area from San Bernardino to San Luis Obispo and, with about 12 
million residents, the most populous federal judicial district in the country. 
</P>
<P>
She assumes her post at a time when the area is considered one of the major 
national centers of drug crime, money laundering, savings and loan scams and 
defense contracting fraud, four principal areas of concern to federal 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, she will be faced with deciding whether charges should be lodged 
against Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, the subject of a federal grand jury 
investigation for some months stemming, in part, from his relationship with a 
local bank and questions about whether he was the beneficiary of insider 
knowledge on stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Baird will become one of only five female U.S. attorneys in the country and one 
of the few who speaks Spanish fluently. She also is the first grandmother ever 
selected for the post. 
</P>
<P>
Baird said she does not look at herself "as a woman U.S. attorney," but rather 
as a U.S. attorney who happens to be a woman. 
</P>
<P>
She also is one of few Democrats appointed to such a plum position in the 
Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Though Baird was 
rated "very well qualified" by a screening committee for Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.), more than a few cynics said his decision to recommend her to 
President Bush for nomination was a canny political move in his gubernatorial 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
As a woman, a native of Ecuador and a Democrat, Baird stood out from the 
competition -- three well-qualified Republican white males -- to succeed Robert 
Bonner as U.S. attorney when he was elevated to a federal judgeship 13 months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Baird said she was "flabbergasted" when first asked a year ago by a member of 
the screening committee to submit an application, even though she had passed 
conservative muster previously, having been appointed a Los Angeles Municipal 
Court judge in 1986 by Gov. George Deukmejian and then elevated by him to the 
Superior Court in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson formally sent her name to Bush last Nov. 29. Even though no problems 
arose, it took almost six more months for Bush to formally nominate her and a 
month-and-a-half for Baird to clear the Senate. During the last 13 months, 
there have been two interim U.S. attorneys and Bonner, after serving a year as 
a federal judge, has been nominated to head the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Adminstration. 
</P>
<P>
Baird said she is looking forward to taking on what she called "the best legal 
job in Los Angeles," a position where she hopes she can make an impact on 
crime. And she made it clear that she feels this is a task of considerable 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
"Crime is rampant," she declared, specifically citing drug-related crimes. "My 
experience on the bench has indicated to me the horror of drugs -- the main 
problem in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
She said that about 80% of the custody cases that she has heard as a Juvenile 
Court judge also have involved narcotics problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Drugs pervade the society," she said. "I'm not a prophet of doom, but I can't 
tell you how it's going to be overcome." 
</P>
<P>
Baird believes in tough sentences for drug offenders. On the other hand, she 
said that even though a lot of her hopes about rehabilitating drug users have 
been dashed by what she had seen in recent years, Baird also maintains that 
"there clearly is a need for more treatment facilities." 
</P>
<P>
As U.S. attorney, she will be taking over an office of about 140 attorneys, 
more than twice as many as when she was an assistant U.S. attorney from 1977 to 
1983. The office also handles a larger percentage of more complex cases now 
than it did then, according to veteran attorneys there. 
</P>
<P>
"Lourdes will have a major job just determining the structure of the office 
with all the new attorneys we're getting to handle drug and S&amp;L fraud 
cases," said Leon Weidman, who heads the asset forfeiture unit of the U.S. 
attorney's office and worked on a major movie tax shelter fraud case with her 
in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Baird is widely praised in legal circles for her judgment, fairness, 
administrative skills, her sense of humor and her ability to relate to a wide 
variety of individuals and groups. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Paul Boland, who as the presiding 
Juvenile Court judge has been Baird's boss for the last year, said she is 
regarded as "among the finest judges ever to hear dependency cases in Los 
Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
The only negative comments about her were made by Lew Gurwitz of Cambridge, 
Mass., one of the lawyers who opposed Baird in what she described as perhaps 
the most interesting case she handled as a federal prosecutor -- the 1979 trial 
of American Indian activist Leonard Peltier, who faced multiple charges 
stemming from his escape from Lompoc federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Baird was lead prosecutor in a stormy trial in which Peltier and his supporters 
contended he was trying to escape because there was a government conspiracy to 
kill him. 
</P>
<P>
She said it seemed like the monthlong trial lasted "an eternity." Baird still 
vividly remembers the sound of drums being beaten outside the courthouse by 
Peltier's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Peltier had been transferred to Lompoc earlier that year from the federal 
maximum-security prison in Marion, Ill., where he was serving two consecutive 
life sentences after a 1977 conviction for killing two FBI agents during a gun 
battle on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Peltier's lawyers said their client had learned from another inmate that "there 
was a conspiracy on the part of the government" to kill him. U.S. District 
Judge Lawrence T. Lydick prohibited an attempt to present a defense based on 
such a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Peltier's lawyers attempted in various ways to get the issue 
before the jury, precipitating repeated objections from Baird and co-counsel 
Robert Biniaz that were sustained by Lydick. 
</P>
<P>
The jury convicted Peltier of escape and being a felon in possession of a gun 
but acquitted him on other charges. 
</P>
<P>
Baird made it clear that she is proud of the work she did on that case, and her 
co-counsel Biniaz, now a vice president at MCA Entertainment, described her 
performance as "grace under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
But defense lawyer Gurwitz called Baird's demeanor "mean-spirited" and said he 
was disturbed to hear she had been appointed U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Baird said she has no second thoughts about any case she handled as a 
prosecutor, adding that she could not say that about every case she handled in 
private practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the government wears the white hat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That is the sort of stance one would expect of a prosecutor, as is her stand 
favoring the death penalty in certain cases. But some of Baird's other views 
might surprise the White House. 
</P>
<P>
She said she favors passage of the equal rights amendment, explaining, "I 
always have been interested in what have been described as women's issues." 
</P>
<P>
Baird said she had been a Republican until the 1970s when she switched to the 
Democratic Party because of its advocacy of some of those issues, including 
expanded availability of child care. 
</P>
<P>
Baird declined comment on abortion. She said it is conceivable, but not likely, 
that she might at some point have to enforce a federal law relating to 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"My duty is to enforce federal law and it's not up to me to judge what I like 
and don't like," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles lawyer Molly Munger, who became Baird's friend shortly after she 
graduated from law school, said Baird's colleagues assumed early on that she 
would become a judge or attain some other significant public position. "She was 
perfect for some higher office," Munger said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview at a downtown Mexican restaurant, Baird put down her fork 
and laughed vigorously when told about these expectations. She said that, given 
her late start in college, she did not expect to grab the brass ring. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a homemaker; I was doing Toll House cookies," said Baird, recalling her 
decision to resume her formal education after an 11-year hiatus once the 
youngest of her children was enrolled in school. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Quito, Ecuador, she quickly reminded a reporter that she had had "a 
rather Spanish colonial upbringing," being the youngest of seven children of a 
devoutly Catholic woman. When she was a year old, her family moved to Los 
Angeles in 1936 because of her father's career. They settled on Van Ness Avenue 
in the shadow of St. Brendan's Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
She spent her youth in Catholic schools and graduated from Immaculate Heart 
High School. Baird said those experiences served her well in several respects. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something in retrospect that was great about going to an all-girls 
high school," she said. The school was run by a highly independent order of 
nuns, who later clashed with the Los Angeles Archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
"Those nuns were so independent, even in the 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
Having their own sports teams gave students at Immaculate Heart physical skills 
as well as insights into what then was the male-dominated sports world, said 
Baird, who is an avid jogger, hiker and cross-country skier. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Immaculate Heart, Baird briefly attended secretarial school. 
Within a couple of years, she was married to William T. Baird, a businessman. 
The year John F. Kennedy was elected President, the Bairds had their first 
child, William Jr., who now works in television in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Two other children -- Maria, the self-described "full-time mom" of a 2-year-old 
in Berkeley, and John, a UC Santa Cruz student -- came along within six years. 
</P>
<P>
Attending LACC part time, it took Baird five years to get her associate in arts 
degree. But after that, her academic pace quickened. She transferred to UCLA, 
earned a BA in sociology in 1973, then moved on to law school. 
</P>
<P>
She did well, particularly in a trial advocacy course where Boland was one of 
her professors. Baird was divorced in 1975. The following year, after 
graduating from law school, she was hired by then-U.S. Atty. William D. Keller 
as an assistant prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Keller, now a federal judge in Los Angeles, had high praise for Baird, as did 
his successor, Andrea Ordin, who was the U.S. attorney from 1977 to 1980 and is 
now California's chief assistant attorney general. Ordin, the first woman ever 
to serve as U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, praised Baird's work on complex 
white-collar crime cases, experience she is likely to utilize immediately in 
the new post. 
</P>
<P>
Baird indicated some regret that her late parents, particularly her mother, 
would not be able to see her in her new job. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my mother would be very surprised that I was about to be, as someone 
described me, 'Top Cop.' But I don't think she would be disappointed."
