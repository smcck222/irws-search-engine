DOOR-TO-DOOR SHUTTLE SERVICE MAY EASE AIRPORT CONGESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The number of door-to-door shuttles serving Lindbergh Field is expected to 
double next month when the state Public Utilities Commission approves an 
application by a new company to provide airport transport service to most of 
San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Port District officials, who administer the airport, said they hope the 
increased shuttle service will encourage more air travelers to use public 
transportation. Only 5% of the estimated 11 million travelers who pass through 
Lindbergh Field each year use public transportation, according to airport 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
That percentage is on the "low side for an airport this size in the Western 
United States," according to Jerry Reas, transportation specialist for the San 
Diego Unified Port District. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shuttle Express Application 
</P>
<P>
The latest company to seek entry into the San Diego market is Shuttle Express 
International, which filed an application with the State Public Utilities 
Commission in January but still must provide the state with "proof of insurance 
and other documents" before final approval is given, according to Dianne 
Dienstein, a PUC spokeswoman in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But Reas said approval is all but certain, and airport officials expect the 
shuttle service to begin by the middle of August. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Zabrowski, who operates Shuttle Express, said he expects to win a franchise 
from Los Angeles-based Super Shuttle to operate the new service. Super Shuttle 
now provides door-to-door shuttle service to and from most major airports in 
California and airports in Miami, Dallas and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Zabrowski said he expects to use 35 new vans when his company begins operations 
next month and plans to provide service to all areas in San Diego County. 
Zabrowski declined to comment on the fares his company will charge and on other 
aspects of the service until he receives PUC approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
13 Carriers Working Now 
</P>
<P>
Shuttle service to and from the airport is now provided by 13 companies, Reas 
said. Three of the companies provide jitney service, which is limited to a 
prescribed route, much the same as buses are, and is regulated by the 
Metropolitan Transportation Development Board. The 10 other companies provide 
door-to-door airport shuttle service within specific zones and are regulated by 
the PUC. The shuttle and jitney companies combined operate 40 vehicles to and 
from the airport, Reas said. 
</P>
<P>
Airporter Express, which has provided airport shuttle service for the past 
seven years, is the oldest company providing door-to-door service in San Diego. 
Each company is required to pay an annual $200-per-vehicle fee to the port for 
the privilege of loading and unloading passengers at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Reas said airport officials welcome Zabrowski's entry into the airport 
transport business because the new service could alleviate congestion at 
Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
"The airport would like to get people out of their cars. We would like people 
to use shuttle vans, taxis, San Diego Transit . . . because we are already 
crowded with traffic. The more people we can get to use these efficient means 
of transportation, the better off we'll be," said Reas. 
</P>
<P>
Coleen Stroup, owner of Aero Express, began an airport shuttle service earlier 
this year. Although the company carried about 1,750 passengers in its first 
month, Stroup said the figure could have been higher. She said few people use 
the service because "they don't understand why the vans are there." 
</P>
<P>
"They understand courtesy vans, like the ones that service the car rental 
companies and hotels, but not public vans," Stroup said. "They're unaware of 
this service unless they've used it in other areas like Los Angeles or San 
Francisco. Our best bet is word-of-mouth advertising. We get a lot of referrals 
this way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shuttle Critics 
</P>
<P>
But the shuttle services have their detractors, largely members of the taxi 
industry who complain that shuttles do not really favor the consumer and that 
airport rules are biased in favor of the shuttle companies. 
</P>
<P>
"A taxicab is cheaper because several people can ride for the price of one. 
Shuttle fares are paid per person," said Alfredo Hueso, whose family owns USA 
Cab Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Shuttle fares are usually set by ZIP code area. The farther a ZIP code is from 
the airport, the more expensive the ride. 
</P>
<P>
Aero Express' fares range from $4 per person for a downtown trip to $30 for a 
trip to Escondido, Stroup said. Actually, Escondido warrants three rates, with 
$30 as the highest, because it has three ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
Aero Express charges $2 for each additional person in a party and provides 
on-call service. It also services the Amtrak station, Sea World and the San 
Diego Zoo, said Stroup. The company utilizes six vans and operates along the 
coast and in North County. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Pac Transport, which has offered door-to-door airport service for the past 
three years, runs an hourly scheduled service to and from the airport, said 
operating owner Jake Keegan. Cal Pac's fares are $15 for the first passenger 
and $10 for each additional passenger in the party going to the same location. 
</P>
<P>
Keegan's zone of operation is the lucrative Interstate 15 corridor, from Rancho 
Penasquitos to Lawrence Welk Village. However, if two or more passengers want 
to ride to or from a less-traveled zone, the company will take them there or 
pick them up for a minimum charge of $10 a person. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll take you there or pick you up only if it's on our way to or from the 
airport, as long as two or more people are involved," said Keegan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cabbies Complain 
</P>
<P>
Cal Pac also has PUC authority to operate in East County, said Keegan, but 
usually leaves that area to other carriers. He said that Cal Pac transports 
about 1,600 passengers a month. 
</P>
<P>
Cabdrivers complain that shuttle drivers solicit customers at the airport, 
which is illegal. Hueso charged that shuttle drivers frequently go inside the 
terminals "with signs that say, 'La Jolla, $20.' " 
</P>
<P>
Under airport rules, taxi and shuttle drivers are supposed to wait for 
passengers to approach them at designated islands outside the terminals. Signs 
outside the east and west terminals direct passengers to the islands. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that the airport doesn't have the manpower to enforce the rules 
and regulations. Most of the time there is no enforcement when the shuttle 
drivers go inside the airport and solicit. . . . We don't mind the competition 
from the shuttles, but let's have the rules applied equally," Hueso said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hollingsworth, director of administrative services for the Port District, 
acknowledged that soliciting by shuttle drivers has been a problem. But he said 
most of the problems are a result of drivers who work on commission. 
</P>
<P>
"That seems to be our biggest problem . . . but it's a manageable problem. . . 
. The taxis' complaint is not unwarranted, but we have also found taxi drivers 
soliciting as well," Hollingsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that airport officials hope to manage the problem with the hiring of 
seven new traffic officers, who are expected to begin working Aug. 1. Officials 
also hope to be able to better manage the shuttles and cabs by assigning them 
to a new island being constructed at the airport. Both groups will share 
opposite sides of the island and will be separated by landscaping, said 
Hollingsworth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restricted to Island 
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, shuttles are restricted to the center island outside 
the terminal, while cabs are required to wait at the island farthest away from 
the terminal. Hollingsworth said that airport officials decided to initiate a 
new system where both groups share the same island because "the taxis 
complained that their competitors were getting first shot at passengers." 
</P>
<P>
Another frequent complaint from cabdrivers is that, although individual cabs 
can only work out of the airport every three days, shuttle drivers are 
authorized to transport passengers to and from the airport every day. But, Reas 
said, cab companies still have the advantage because there are 150 cabs working 
the airport on any given day, competing with 40 shuttles and jitneys. 
</P>
<P>
Airport rules allow only two shuttle vans from the same company at each 
terminal at the same time.

CONTEST DRAWS FRIENDS AND FAMILY AS AMATEUR SURFERS GO FOR BIG TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At the innocent age of 16, Heidi Jacobs is already a surfing widow, another 
casualty of those crazy board wars. 
</P>
<P>
With her luxurious blond hair and California tan, the Seal Beach teen-ager is 
the kind of girl most young football lettermen would kill for. But Wednesday 
morning, she was sitting on a North County beach being ignored again, playing 
spectator to her boyfriend one more time. 
</P>
<P>
Out in the surf, 15-year-old Ryan Simmons was zig-zagging his short board like 
a teen possessed, grabbing all the attention, as if he were the beauty queen. 
</P>
<P>
"He practices five hours every day, sometimes 10, depending on whether he has 
any competitions coming up," Jacobs said, sighing. "When other guys are taking 
their girlfriends to the movies, Ryan's hitting the surf." 
</P>
<P>
But doesn't that crash a wave onto their budding relationship? 
</P>
<P>
"Naw," she said, bashfully digging her foot into the sand. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes it does," interrupted 16-year-old Bridget Carey. "In fact, they're 
fighting right now. Ryan doesn't appreciate the fact that Heidi came all the 
way down here just to watch him. He says it breaks his concentration." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons is a top-seeded entrant in the U. S. Amateur Surfing Championships 
being held this week in Oceanside. Like 500 other aspirants, he wants badly to 
win, to ride the wave all the way to the rarefied professional surfing ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, though, this amateur tournament is the big time for guys like 
Simmons. All of the surfing magazines will be there for stories and pictures. 
And the weekend finals will be broadcast over ESPN to a national audience. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, amateur surfers from New Jersey to Hawaii will be on the water, 
pulling the most radical maneuvers from their pouch of tricks -- moves with 
names like "the flyaway," "the roundhouse cutback" and "the floater." 
</P>
<P>
Through Sunday, the contest will transform Oceanside's north jetty into a 
regular Southern California happening, a scene of darkly 
</P>
<P>
suntanned bodies, surfboards, colorful bandannas over blond heads, beach 
thongs, big straw hats -- and more outrageously suntanned bodies. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, still early in the scheme of things, more than 100 
spectators had taken the day off to loll in the sand and catch the action. 
There were surfers' moms and dads, aunts and uncles, and girlfriends, along 
with a North County surf club composed of watchful pre-teens. 
</P>
<P>
There were brothers and sisters, high school surfing coaches and a curious 
breed of surfing tumbleweed -- down-and-outers who rolled into the nearby 
parking lot with a three-day beard growth, their belongings stored in the back 
seats of cars that belched blue smoke. They were men who claimed to be "close 
personal friends with Tommy Curren," the three-time professional surfing 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
For Mike Wilkins, a spokesman for the tournament, the turnout proves at least 
one thing: Amateur surfing is on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
"The surf-wear industry may be in decline; kids in Iowa aren't rushing to the 
stores to buy surf shorts and tops anymore," he said. "But, on the coast, young 
people are taking up the sport more than ever. There's no shortage of young 
surfers, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High School Teams 
</P>
<P>
There are other vital signs for the health of the sport. Coastal high schools 
throughout the country are starting surfing teams to compete with other 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
In California, there is a move to have high school surf teams sanctioned by the 
California Interscholastic Federation, which would establish governing rules 
and a playoff schedule -- in effect, giving the sport more legitimacy, Wilkins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's also a move to make surfing a sanctioned Olympic sport," he said. 
"And, if that occurs, these amateur tournaments will be the next best thing to 
Olympic trials." 
</P>
<P>
The success of the sport makes Wilkins worry that some youngsters are being 
swept up in their dedication to it -- and all that it has come to stand for. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a bumper sticker you see on a lot of cars these days that reads 'Real 
Surfers Don't Work.' And that idea worries me," said Wilkins, who grew up 
catching the waves off Huntington Beach in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that, to be a successful surfer, you have to drop out of society, 
collect all those free surfboards and wet suits from sponsors, and never have 
to work a day in your life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grades Plus Waves 
</P>
<P>
So Wilkins is making sure that the new generation of surfers doesn't drop out. 
His 14-year-old daughter, an amateur surfer who competes on a San Clemente high 
school team, doesn't hit the water unless her grades are above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids focus so much on the sport to the point that they're not plugging 
into what the rest of life is all about," he said. "Some perspective needs to 
be established." 
</P>
<P>
For young athletes with the proper goals in mind, Wilkins said, the amateur 
surfing competitions are the ticket to success. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the way to use the beach scene in a positive way -- as opposed to just 
hanging out," he said. "It's like the old days when I grew up. There's just 
good, clean-cut, hard-core surfing. The only people you're going to see smoking 
out here are the parents." 
</P>
<P>
For the surfer with an eye on a professional break, the U.S. Amateur Surfing 
Championship is a must-win. To get to this point, the surfers must have scored 
the most points in yearlong competitions sponsored by any one of the seven 
associations that make up the U.S. Surfing Federation. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when you find out how good you are," he said. "The kids who make it 
here are the best in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
Next, winners vie for a spot on the U.S. Amateur Surfing Team, which competes 
internationally. From there, many go on to professional sponsorships and a life 
style of world travel that most young surfers can only dream about. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Age 10 to 55 
</P>
<P>
But, before the pro ranks, come the amateur contests. On Wednesday, surfers 
from 10 to 55 competed in a series of daylong heats on 2- to 3-foot waves. 
</P>
<P>
At the blare of a foghorn, the seven entrants of each heat raced out into the 
water, paddling their boards furiously toward the surf. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I don't use binoculars to watch the action, you miss too much of 
the real competition," said 23-year-old John O'Connor of Laguna Beach. "You 
know, watching the guys lying on their stomachs, paddling out to see who gets 
priority on the waves. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the real battle. You don't have to be a surfer to appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
For the judges, excellence is judged by a surfer's best three waves in a 
15-minute period. "The judges are looking to see who gets the biggest waves, 
the longest ride and who does the most radical maneuvers," Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
As the surfers raced toward shore, an emcee described the action for the crowd, 
his voice booming from two loudspeakers perched atop folding chairs, which 
leaned precariously in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
The surfers carved wide turns, went airborne and gracefully played on the 
breaking waves. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd applauded often. But they weren't the only ones enjoying the action. 
</P>
<P>
"We love this stuff, it makes the beach not so touristy like it usually is," 
said 17-year-old Sean Connor, a concessionaire at the North Jetty Sandwich 
Shop, a Frisbee's throw from the sand. "Usually, you see lots of moms and dads, 
old guys with beer bellies. This week, you're seeing the little surfer dudes 
and their girlfriends. It's kicked back." 
</P>
<P>
Heather Aird, another sandwich saleswoman, said the shop's business increases 
fivefold during such competitions. "It's just funner," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Running From Sun 
</P>
<P>
And there is another difference along the north jetty beach this week. People 
are running from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"These surfers are out in the sun, day in and day out, maybe too much," Wilkins 
said. "They're aware of things like sun damage and skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"So when the sun pops out, you'll see the surfers heading for the shade. That 
doesn't happen on a normal day at the beach." 
</P>
<P>
For the amateur surfers Wednesday, the thrill of victory came often. So did the 
pain of elimination. 
</P>
<P>
At a snack bar away from the crashing waves, 15-year-old Rob Machado and his 
friend, Frankie Hejduk, shared a candy bar and a couple packages of chocolate 
doughnuts. It was sort of a consolation prize. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missing the Big Ones 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old Hejduk had lost out in his preliminary heat. Machado, on the 
other hand, had advanced. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't catch any good waves," Hejduk explained with his head down, his 
braces bared as he popped another doughnut into his mouth. "You usually know 
when you're out there whether you've won or lost." 
</P>
<P>
Both boys had spent long hours polishing their techniques off the Encinitas 
shoreline, dreaming of one day becoming award-winning surfers. Now, for this 
tournament anyway, the hopes of only one remained. 
</P>
<P>
But Hejduk said he would be back today -- not in the water, though, but on the 
beach, cheering on his best buddy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what friends are for," he said.

BUILDERS MOBILIZE TO BLOCK A BORDER AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A potentially powerful coalition of large developers is quietly organizing to 
block the placement of an international airport on Otay Mesa, a project that 
could wipe out builders' plans to put thousands of homes and hundreds of acres 
of industrial and commercial structures on the mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Michael Murphy, president of California Structures, the group, which is 
still in its formative stages, would represent the first substantial organized 
opposition to efforts by Councilman Ron Roberts to locate a binational airport 
on the border with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Its activity could put business and real estate development interests at odds 
with Roberts, an architect who during his two-year tenure on the council has 
enjoyed generally good relations with business leaders and builders. 
</P>
<P>
A consulting firm hired by the San Diego Assn. of Governments has narrowed the 
list of potential replacements for overburdened Lindbergh Field to Miramar 
Naval Air Station, a site east of the air station and a joint facility on the 
Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandag consultant is scheduled to issue a final recommendation in 
September, and the San Diego City Council is expected to discuss a choice this 
fall, sometime before a moratorium on housing construction near Brown Field 
expires Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open to All 3 Sites 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who has said he is open to all three sites, has been negotiating with 
Mexican officials to keep the binational option open. He is in Mexico this week 
for negotiations on the airport, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Known currently as "Keep Lindbergh Field," the anti-Otay Mesa organization 
includes the Pardee Construction Co. and has conducted discussions with the 
Baldwin Co. 
</P>
<P>
The two home builders could see their plans to build 6,000 homes west of Brown 
Field wiped out because of noise and safety concerns if Roberts' negotiations 
with the Mexican government come to fruition. An Otay Mesa airport with 
north-south runways also could jeopardize Baldwin's plans to build homes and 
offices on more than 20,000 unincorporated acres of Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The group is negotiating a contract with Stoorza, Ziegaus Metzger, a prominent 
public relations firm that frequently represents development interests, said 
Gail Stoorza Gill, the firm's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"No contract has been signed," Gill said. "We're talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with California Structures, which owns 240 acres of industrially 
zoned land on the city portion of Otay Mesa, did not return numerous telephone 
calls. Steve Doyle, a Pardee executive, said he believes his firm is 
participating in the formation of the interest group. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Smith, president of The Baldwin Co. and John Kern, a consultant for the 
firm, said the company is not involved in formation of the interest group. 
However, sources said the company has been approached and is engaging in 
discussions about creation of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said committee organizers are considering Great American Bank 
Chairman Gordon Luce, former City Councilman Bill Cleator and others as 
possible chairmen for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
A key test of the business leaders' clout could come today, when the San Diego 
Chamber of Commerce's board of directors hears a presentation from a 
subcommittee on airport location alternatives. Though there are no specific 
plans for the board to take a position on the site, "anything can happen," said 
Gill, who also is chairman of the chamber's board. 
</P>
<P>
(Gill said that because of her firm's possible involvement with the Keep 
Lindbergh Field group, she will not participate in chamber votes on the airport 
site selection.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pitch to Keep Lindbergh 
</P>
<P>
Murphy and Roberts made presentations to the Chamber's executive committee July 
13, but Stoorza declined to reveal whether that group, which makes 
recommendations to the full board, took a position. 
</P>
<P>
An outline distributed by Murphy claims that Lindbergh, now overcrowded with 11 
million passengers annually, could handle a more than 30 million passengers 
annually if 48 acres of the adjacent Marine Corps Recruit Depot were acquired. 
However, Jack Koerper, project manager for Sandag, said there is no support for 
that position in a consultant's report on the crowding prepared for the San 
Diego Board of Port Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay politicians such as San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner and County 
Supervisor Brian Bilbray publicly oppose placement of the airport in the South 
Bay, but both said they are not working with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes no fiscal sense," said Filner, who also believes that negotiations 
with Mexico would be impossible to complete. "It destroys the whole industrial 
economic policy we have for Otay Mesa, and it's fiscally irresponsible. There's 
no way we can afford to buy all the land." 
</P>
<P>
The two options outlined by the Sandag consultant for a binational airport 
would consume 6,638 or 3,436 acres, depending on which one is chosen, according 
to the consultant's report. The larger would require acquisition of 5,585 acres 
of commercially and industrially zoned land. The smaller would require purchase 
of 2,411 acres, the report shows. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who supports the smaller option, believes that the city has little 
choice in relocation because Lindbergh is not a viable long-term option and the 
Navy has flatly refused to negotiate giving up Miramar, home of its famed Top 
Gun flier school. Safety considerations also make it the best choice, an aide 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The justification is that we don't appear to have another option for a site 
physically in this county, and the consultant looked at the entire county," the 
aide said.

EX-J. DAVID AIDE SAYS HUNTER HAD ACCESS TO DATA ON FIRM'S WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former financial officer for the J. David &amp; Co. investment firm testified 
Wednesday that he prepared statements for J. David (Jerry) Dominelli and Nancy 
Hoover Hunter indicating the dismal financial shape of some J. David 
subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Kalabokes, who worked in the La Jolla offices of J. David &amp; Co. just 
before the firm's collapse in 1984, said the statements were prepared at 
Hunter's and Dominelli's request and for their eyes only. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony appeared to undercut Hunter's contention that she was unaware of 
the illegal activities that led to the downfall of the apparently profitable 
investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter is charged with 234 counts of fraud, conspiracy and income-tax evasion 
stemming from her alleged role as a key executive in the firm. After the firm 
was forced into bankruptcy court in 1984, it became clear that the operation 
was huge Ponzi scheme, where money from new investors was used to pay off old 
clients and little successful trading was done. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter actively participated in "all facets of the operations," especially 
personnel matters, Kalabokes testified. 
</P>
<P>
Kalabokes said reports he prepared for about seven months, beginning in June, 
1983, indicated that all of the J. David subsidiaries under his control lost 
money every month, particularly J. David Securities, which "showed significant 
losses." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kalabokes oversaw a number of J. David entities, he was denied access 
to documents and other information related to some of the major subsidiaries 
and several checking accounts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"With a smile on his face, (Dominelli) told me it was none of my business," 
Kalabokes said. 
</P>
<P>
Kalabokes, who is now president of a Northern California winery, is expected to 
take the stand again this morning.

FOOTHILL TRANSIT GETS GREEN LIGHT TO OPERATE DESPITE RTD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG QUINTANA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last year, backers of the fledgling Foothill Transit Zone have 
contended with various legal and political roadblocks, including a trial over 
whether it could even exist. 
</P>
<P>
The hurdles have hampered the agency's plans to take over more than a third of 
the San Gabriel Valley's bus service from the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, Foothill Transit may have escaped its most serious threat when a 
Los Angeles Superior Court judge upheld its right to operate, surmounting a 
challenge by RTD drivers and mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tomorrow," said William P. Forsythe, Foothill Transit executive 
vice president. The decision "is going to allow us to do what we set out to do 
a long time ago -- provide a transit option for people out here instead of 
driving a car." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Eli Chernow on Tuesday upheld Foothill 
Transit's continued operation, which includes its plans to take over up to 20 
of RTD's 54 lines in the Foothill area by the middle of next year. Foothill 
Transit, a partnership among 20 area cities and the county, contracts with 
private bus companies to provide service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a clear victory for all the people of the San Gabriel Valley," said 
Claremont Councilwoman Judy Wright, who is president of the transit zone and a 
frequent critic of the RTD's San Gabriel Valley service. "I've been working on 
this for 13 years . . . so I feel this is a culmination of that work." 
</P>
<P>
During the monthlong trial that ended in June, union attorneys contended that 
Foothill Transit threatened union jobs at RTD and was an illegal, "privatized" 
competitor. Representatives of the United Transportation Union, which 
represents drivers, and the Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents 
mechanics, charged that Foothill was an attempt to bust the unions. Foothill 
officials deny that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls Much of the Case Political 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Chernow said much of the case was political and not under the 
court's jurisdiction. He ruled that Foothill was legally created and that the 
potential harm to the area's bus riders if Foothill were not allowed to take 
over the lines outweighed the possible adverse impact on RTD workers. 
</P>
<P>
Chernow's decision gives the unions 15 days to appeal. Neither union 
representatives nor their attorneys could be reached about whether they will do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
"We will go forward and do whatever we have to do, and if an appeal is part of 
it, then we'll be there," Wright said. "But I'm hoping that the decision is 
strong enough to prevent that." 
</P>
<P>
Foothill's vice president, Robert Bartlett, was blunter: "When the decision 
comes out so clearly one way or another, appeals tend not to look so bright." 
</P>
<P>
Since December, Foothill has contracted with Embree Bus Lines to operate two 
freeway express routes from Diamond Bar and Glendora to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Transit's base fare is 85 cents, compared to the RTD's base fare of 
$1.10. Forsythe has estimated that ridership has increased up to 20% on the 
lines since Foothill took them over. There now are more than 2,660 riders on 
the Foothill lines each day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill plans to add five local lines in the mid-San Gabriel Valley area in 
August, bringing to seven the number of routes taken over from the RTD. 
</P>
<P>
Forsythe said Foothill is negotiating with Cincinnati-based ATE Inc. to operate 
the lines. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill, having ordered 60 new buses, intends to take over two additional 
express lines in late January from the Pomona Valley to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Transit was approved by the county Transportation Commission, which 
oversees county transportation policy, in late 1987 as a low-cost alternative 
to the RTD. The effort was spearheaded by county Supervisor Pete Schabarum, a 
strident RTD critic, who charged that the area suffered from inadequate service 
and a disproportionate number of RTD cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unions Won Temporary Injunction 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, its start-up was stalled in June of last year when Chernow 
granted the unions a temporary injunction until the RTD consented to Foothill's 
taking over lines. 
</P>
<P>
In the six months that followed, the Transportation Commission withheld more 
than $9 million a month from the RTD's budget. In return for the money, the RTD 
board consented in December to Foothill's operating. At the time, Schabarum was 
commission chairman. 
</P>
<P>
But the threat of a permanent injunction, which could have killed the zone, 
remained until Tuesday.

VALDEZ IS CLEARED TO GO NEARER POSSIBLE TEMPORARY REPAIR SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Coast Guard on Wednesday gave permission for the beleaguered Exxon Valdez 
to move within 7 miles of San Clemente Island, and Exxon Co. officials are 
testing those waters as a possible site for repairs to the ship's hull, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The repairs, involving the removal of six massive steel plates jutting from the 
bottom of the tanker, might start today if weather and ocean conditions allow, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Onshore, representatives of the state and Exxon Shipping Co. met for several 
hours to discuss conditions that Exxon must meet before the Valdez is allowed 
into state waters. The conditions were presented to Exxon on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although sources close to the proceedings earlier said they thought Exxon might 
refuse some of the state's demands, officials late Wednesday said they were 
"cautiously optimistic" about the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings were expected to continue today). 
</P>
<P>
"We're making some progress. There are no problems with the concept. An awful 
lot of the difficulties are in terms of the language" used in the state's 
12-page document to Exxon, said Anthony Summers, supervising state deputy 
attorney general. "A lot of the concern is that the agreement is not specific 
enough and leaves a lot of holes open." 
</P>
<P>
The state Lands Commission, attorney general, Department of Fish and Game and 
Regional Water Quality Control Board drew up the conditions that the company 
must meet before the ship enters state waters for repairs, either to remove the 
plates or to enter dry dock later in San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The state has demanded, among other things, that the Valdez not discharge oil 
or pollutants for 24 hours before it enters state waters, that it provide 
cleanup and pollution prevention equipment throughout the repairs and that it 
post a $20-million line of credit in case the company breaches the agreement. 
Exxon's liability in case of damage done to the state environment, however, 
would not necessarily be limited to that amount, the document noted. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials declined to comment Wednesday, saying only that they were 
prepared to negotiate with the state. But Summers said the amount of money 
requested for the credit line was not discussed in that day's meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"In all honesty, we have not discussed amounts. We have discussed concepts and 
circumstances under which money would have to be paid to the state of 
California," he said. "Nobody's guaranteeing on either side that we're going to 
get an agreement. We're all going on the premise that these are the basic 
concepts we want to work with." 
</P>
<P>
If the state and Exxon agree on the conditions, an earlier lawsuit filed by 
state agencies that would bar Exxon from state waters would be suspended, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker was towed from Alaska after hitting a reef and causing the nation's 
worst oil spill along the Prince William Sound shoreline. The ship was 
scheduled to enter San Diego Bay July 11 for a $25-million, nine-month repair 
job at National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., which built the vessel in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But the discovery July 10 of five steel plates jutting from the ship's hull, 
and the slicks and discharges believed to be coming from the Valdez have 
delayed its entry. 
</P>
<P>
The plates, peeled back by turbulent seas during the tanker's 2,200-mile 
transit from Alaska, prevent the ship from clearing the bottom of San Diego 
Bay. Some jut as much as 70 feet below the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez late last week moved near Pyramid Cove at San Clemente Island to 
take shelter from rough sea swells that peeled at least one other plate from 
the ship's bottom and on Wednesday moved about 4 miles nearer to the island. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon planned to send divers into the water Wednesday afternoon to determine 
whether the seas would be calm enough to allow workers to remove the plates, 
said Jan Cool, a spokeswoman for Exxon Shipping Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the sooner we can get the plates situation under control, the sooner 
we can get the ship into the harbor," Cool said. "Obviously everybody wants to 
bring this to a rapid conclusion. But we are not going to endanger anyone's 
health or safety. This has never been done in open-water conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The divers, from the Portland, Ore.-based Fred Devine Diving &amp; Salvage Co., 
did similar repairs to the vessel in Alaska and are used to working in adverse 
conditions, Nancy Douglas, a spokeswoman for salvage company, said. It was 
divers from the company who discovered the condition of the plates July 10, 
during a final inspection of the tankers in waters near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"This crew has hands-on experience with working with that vessel," Douglas 
said. "Our divers are very capable and are highly experienced. If anyone can do 
the job right, they will. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very safe so far," she said. "We haven't had any problems at all." 
</P>
<P>
It will take the divers five to seven days to cut the steel plates from the 
vessel, most likely bit by bit. Steel cables will be attached to the pieces so 
that they won't fall to the ocean floor. A Devine company salvage vessel will 
then haul the pieces of steel to a barge. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Pyramid Cove had been the preferred site for removal of the plates 
because its waters are calm and protected. But state agencies, which sought 
legal action last week and now are pressing Exxon to agree to its demands, have 
kept the Valdez out of San Clemente Island's state waters, fearing that 
discharges believed to be coming from the Valdez could harm the abundant marine 
life there. 
</P>
<P>
The state's jurisdiction extends 3 miles from the shore. Federal jurisdiction 
generally extends 12 miles from the shore, according to the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
The state has stipulated that any harmful discharge from the Valdez that enters 
state waters, even if it floated in from outside the 3-mile zone, could subject 
Exxon to penalties. But officials said Wednesday that they favor removing the 
plates in the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can take care of the plates without going into state waters, that 
would be very advantageous to our standpoint," Summers said. "If they can 
accomplish that, that would remove one of the big problems" in getting the ship 
into dock. 
</P>
<P>
No discharge of the bluish substance that bubbled from the Valdez last week has 
been seen in at least 70 hours. Earlier, the discharges had been sporadic and 
minute and had dissipated quickly, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Don Montoro. Also, 
westerly winds in the area could help prevent any materials discharged from 
blowing toward the coast, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Montoro said the ship won't come closer than 7 1/2 miles from San Clemente 
Island, and it was expected to move farther offshore late Monday after the 
divers had finished their survey of the conditions, so the ship's tanks could 
be prepared for the repairs. The dangling steel plates will be removed with 
underwater metal-cutting torches. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the closer you get (to state waters), the more risk is involved," 
said Montoro. "Not that we expect any problems, but we're doing everything we 
can to minimize" the risk. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard instructed Exxon to dispatch boats with pollution prevention 
and cleanup equipment to the vessel, and some of the boats were on the way, 
Montoro said. He also stipulated that the vessel and the assisting boats 
undergo an emergency-procedures drill before the repairs are begun. The drill 
was scheduled for this morning. 
</P>
<P>
If the removal is begun in open seas, the rougher waters could limit the 
operation and force the Valdez into state waters to complete the work, Exxon 
officials acknowledged. Either way, Exxon still will face tough state scrutiny 
when it enters San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to get into dry dock, we still have to meet the state's demands," 
Cool said. "Clearly, we don't want to leave a tanker with a bunch of holes in 
it off the coast of California indefinitely. We're just trying to do something 
constructive." 
</P>
<P>
Samples from the ship's tanks taken early this week are still being analyzed in 
Sorrento Valley and Colorado labs, and the results are expected within several 
days, the Coast Guard said. The tests are expected to show exactly what has 
been discharging from the vessel and how harmful it may be. Earlier tests had 
revealed that the discharge contained equal parts of weathered crude oil and 
marine life. 
</P>
<P>
The results also will determine whether the Valdez is the source of several 
sheens and slicks discovered near the ship, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No discharge was seen coming from the ship Wednesday, but another sheen, about 
75 yards wide by 1 1/2 miles long, was sighted about 13 miles southeast of the 
tanker, in a normal shipping lane, the Coast Guard reported. Samples of that 
sheen and others sighted in the same area were taken by the Coast Guard and are 
being analyzed in the agency's Connecticut lab.

PRESERVE THE TREASURE

<P>
To listen to Bush Administration officials, the unwary would think that the 
only thing standing between the United States and a new energy crisis is the 
obstinacy of elitist Californians who refuse to let the oil companies drill in 
their coastal waters for the plentiful oil that will make the nation energy 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
The record is to the contrary. The misleading argument clouds the 
Administration's commendable efforts to develop a truly balanced national 
energy policy. It overlooks decades of California offshore oil production and 
implies that California is being all but unpatriotic if it does not provide as 
much energy as the state consumes. California is No. 4 among the states in oil 
production, meeting nearly 60% of its own needs. There are promising portions 
of the California outercontinental shelf that can and should be drilled, but 
federal officials have shunned reasonable compromise proposals from California 
congressional leaders in recent years. Still, there is not enough oil off the 
California coast, by anyone's estimates, to make a significant dent in foreign 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and Energy Secretary James D. Watkins 
picked California this week to attack a proposed one-year moratorium on 
offshore oil leasing. The proposal, given momentum by the Exxon Valdez accident 
in Alaska, has passed the House of Representatives and is pending in the 
Senate. Both men insist they do not want to permit drilling in a manner that 
puts the environment at risk. But both left the impression that efforts to free 
the nation from the yoke of Middle Eastern imports were doomed if exploration 
off the coast were delayed for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
Their campaign ignores history. During 1963-1984, the Department of the 
Interior offered 10 million acres of California coast for lease. Oil companies 
bid on, and leased, 2.8 million acres of that. Many leases have lapsed because 
the firms chose not to drill on them, but nearly 800,000 acres remain available 
for drilling. There are 21 working oil platforms in federal waters from Orange 
County to San Luis Obispo. The firms have drilled 633 wells, producing nearly 
400 million barrels of crude. Production has increased about three-fold since 
1980, but exploration has declined because of depressed oil prices. Since 
prices have increased recently, firms are focusing on foreign areas because of 
the the prospects for bigger discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration claims the moratorium leaders are pursuing the wrong target 
because offshore drilling is safe while the culprits of recent spills have been 
tankers. Refusal to drill off the U.S. coast will only require more foreign 
imports that are brought in by tankers, they claim. But Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.), a vigorous proponent of the moratorium, counters that oil from 
remote oil rigs proposed in planned lease sales would be shipped by tanker and 
not by pipeline as with most existing platforms. And he notes that the 
potential oil available -- an estimated 155,000 barrels a day at full 
production -- is not going to establish U.S. independence from imports. The 
latest report of the Harvard Energy Project says that "there is no domestic 
solution" to imports as long as the United States consumes 6 million barrels a 
day more than it produces. Untapped oil reserves in Kern County could amount to 
three times the offshore potential, a state energy commissioner has said. 
</P>
<P>
There is more at risk than spills. Studies indicate drilling can have a major 
impact on fishing and tourist industries. The air pollution from 10 new 
platforms would equal that of 144,000 additional autos in the South Coast air 
basin, according to studies by the Southern California Assn. of Governments for 
Los Angeles and Orange counties. Yet federal officials have refused to yield to 
local air pollution-control standards. 
</P>
<P>
California must, and will, contribute its share of national energy needs. But 
in doing so, it must not be forced to subject its irreplaceable coastal 
environment, a true national treasure, to unnecessary risk.

NEW RULES FOR STUDENT LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal Education Department is taking a more responsible approach to 
curbing student loan defaults now than it did last year. Not only that, its new 
approach could save the federal government $5.4 billion over the next decade. 
However, the department and Congress still need to change eligibility formulas 
to increase the number of students who qualify for aid. 
</P>
<P>
New rules issued a few weeks ago by the new education secretary, Lauro F. 
Cavazos, still penalize colleges with any number of students who fail to pay 
back federally guaranteed loans. But the proposals also offer to help schools 
manage their loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the department threatened to cut off not just loans but all federal 
student aid to schools with default rates above 20%. Community colleges and 
colleges with traditionally black enrollments had the most to lose because 
their low-income students had more trouble than most paying off their loans. 
Black colleges worry that even the newer rules may hurt their students. 
</P>
<P>
Under Cavazos' new plan, federal loans could be cut off or curtailed in 1991 at 
some 200 institutions where more than 60% of past loans were in default. 
Another 450 schools with default rates between 40% and 60% would have to reduce 
defaults by 5% a year or lose some or all their loan money. Schools with 
default rates of more than 20% would have to develop a plan for reducing 
defaults. All schools would provide guidance to first-time borrowers. The 
department would try to reduce discrimination against low-income or minority 
students by making allowances for schools it felt had taken the proper steps 
but still had a default rate of more than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Still at issue is the formula for calculating default rates. One method is to 
compare the number of borrowers who left school in 1986, for example, with 
those who had not started to repay their loans by the end of 1987. Many state 
agencies allow students more time than that to begin repaying loans, usually 
leading to lower default rates. 
</P>
<P>
One target of the Education Department's campaign is unscrupulous trade schools 
that fail to provide sound training but still leave students in debt. The 
department proposes that all such schools, regardless of default rate, be 
required to tell prospective students how many prior students finished their 
courses and landed jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The department's regulations head off legislation that started moving through 
Congress after Cavazos' predecessor, William Bennett, proposed more arbitrary 
cutoffs last year. But the law-makers rightly still want to see the government 
change the calculations that determine loan eligibility. They feel, for 
example, that family homes or farms should not be counted as assets for 
families with incomes below $30,000. That change would make more students 
eligible for loans. It could help reduce loan defaults, too, because more 
middle-class students would be in the loan pool. 
</P>
<P>
The government, colleges and trade schools must do a better job of helping 
students avoid burdensome debt and costly defaults while making sure those who 
are needy are not deterred from higher education. The new rules, prudently 
applied, should move toward those goals.

A NEED FOR LESSONS IN HARD WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign to reform the Soviet economy 
is bogging down on the Red Field Collective Farm. 
</P>
<P>
The battle at Red Field illustrates a problem endemic to the Soviet system as a 
whole: Incentives do not always spur economic change. As Times writer Masha 
Hamilton said in a recent report, Soviet farmers are not racing to start 
private farms. Although Red Field's director has offered employees land and 
equipment to start their own farms and turn their own profits, so far not one 
has seized the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev faces an old economic riddle: If you pay workers more, do they work 
more because their time increases in value? Or do they work less because they 
earn the same amount with less effort? Four years into Gorbachev's campaign to 
restructure the Soviet economy, Soviet workers still seem to prefer the latter. 
"I don't wantto have to work on my own land," Anna K. Milyokhin, a Red Field 
milkmaid, said, "and Idon't know anyone who does." 
</P>
<P>
There are two reasons for reluctance. The first is material: Earning more money 
in the Soviet Union gains one little these days. "Sure, I would make more 
money," Milyokhin explained, "but what would I do with it? There's nothing to 
buy in our stores." Until there is more to buy in the stores, Soviet workers 
will consider time off more valuable than money. 
</P>
<P>
The second reason is more ingrained, particularly for the agricultural system. 
Russia does not have a tradition of proprietary farming. Even in the last 
century, peasants were organized into communes. Land was redistributed every 
few years, reducing incentives to treat land welland creating an atmosphere 
where individual success was considered self-promotion at the expense of the 
group. In many ways, little has changed. Russians still do not know how to be 
individual farmers and, moreover, there are still important cultural taboos 
against individual enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, many non-Russian republics of the Soviet Union do not have the same 
cultural traits and respond more readily to economic incentives. The 
proliferation of Georgian and Baltic entrepreneurs in Moscow attests to this. 
It seems as if Gorbachev may have to rely on such minorities to teach the 
Russian majority the value of hard work.

JURY CLEARS HOSPITAL IN BOY'S MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Harbor Gateway convalescent hospital was not to blame for a 1984 incident in 
which a schizophrenic patient allegedly molested a 6-year-old boy who had come 
to the hospital for a Sunday prayer service, a Van Nuys Superior Court jury 
found this week. 
</P>
<P>
While jurors said Monday that Harbor Convalescent Hospital was negligent in 
permitting the youngster to wander unattended down its hallways, they also 
found that the negligence was not directly to blame for the confrontation with 
the mentally disturbed patient or for the severe psychological trauma that the 
youngster, now 12, has reportedly suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Several jurors said after the verdict that they believed Faith of Our Fathers 
Church in Torrance and two church members were responsible for the boy's 
welfare. The jurors also said they vindicated the hospital because they 
believed witnesses who testified that the boy had psychological problems before 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emotional Trial 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was reached after an emotional seven-week trial and four days of 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Moore, a lawyer for the hospital, praised the verdict. But the 39-year-old 
mother who filed the lawsuit five years ago on behalf of her son said the 
result was "unbelievable" and "unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
The mother said she was not concerned with winning a large cash settlement but 
rather in receiving a verdict affirming the hospital's responsibility. "My son 
was violated and there was no justice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the mother and son, who now live in Huntington Beach, will not walk away 
without compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the trial, the church was dropped as a defendant when it agreed 
to pay a $1-million settlement without admitting that it was liable for the 
boy's injuries. The mother said that at least $350,000 of the settlement will 
go to her attorney, Richard Farnell, and to cover court costs. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said the eleventh-hour settlement may have saved the church, now called 
the Living Word Fellowship, from an even larger loss. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Church Cited 
</P>
<P>
"Too bad the church settled, because we would have nailed the church," said 
jury foreman Linda De Silva. "The church had no credibility to us. . . . It was 
definitely the church that caused all of this," she said. "They were definitely 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Before the settlement, church lawyer Tony Serritella had argued that the 
Torrance congregation could not be held liable because the hospital prayer 
meeting was the personal ministry of two parishioners and not a 
church-sanctioned event. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors had heard testimony that the 6-year-old became restless halfway through 
the prayer meeting on Jan. 22, 1984, and wandered down a hospital corridor 
where Alfred Ray Hatch -- a toothless, bearded man with open sores on his legs 
-- lured him into a treatment room. 
</P>
<P>
A Sheriff's Department report says Hatch admitted that he molested the boy and 
forced the boy to perform sex acts on him. Hatch was charged with oral 
copulation and performing lewd acts with a child but did not have to stand 
trial because he was declared incompetent and was committed to a state mental 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suicide Attempts 
</P>
<P>
The boy's attorney, Farnell, had argued that the hospital was liable for the 
attack because it failed to properly supervise Hatch or the boy. The boy's 
mother testified that in the past five years, he has been depressed and anxious 
and has tried to commit suicide 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
Moore countered that the hospital provided as much security as it could without 
turning the hospital into a prison. He also attempted to show that the boy had 
psychological problems before his encounter with Hatch and that his mother 
impeded his recovery by not following medication and therapy instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's arguments and the jury's own focus of blame on the church led to the 
victory for the hospital, the jurors said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unanimous that the boy was injured and that it was a criminal assault," 
said one juror, who asked not to be named. "The church should have kept track 
of the boy. That was their responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Farnell said he has not yet decided whether to file an appeal.

HARDEMAN CHALLENGES THOMAS' USE OF 'INCUMBENT'; 
</P>
<P>
NEW LEGAL SKIRMISH IN INGLEWOOD COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood City Council candidate Garland Hardeman, adding another twist to a 
two-year legal battle over the city's District 4 seat, has asked the Los 
Angeles Superior Court this week to order his opponent to stop portraying 
himself as an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman is seeking an injunction that would prevent opponent Ervin (Tony) 
Thomas from describing himself as an incumbent throughout the campaign, even 
though Thomas spent nearly two years in office. In court papers filed Monday, 
Hardeman said Thomas violated state election law in his official two-page 
candidate's statement filed earlier this month with the city clerk, when he 
said he was "elected" two years ago and when he urged voters to "reelect" him 
in the Oct. 3 election. 
</P>
<P>
A judge annulled Thomas' June, 1987, election in December, 1987, and ordered 
another contest between Thomas and Hardeman after finding that Thomas campaign 
workers intimidated voters and improperly handled absentee ballots on Election 
Day. Thomas, however, remained in office for almost two years, until this May, 
when his appeals in the case were exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
"My opponent continues to violate the law after massive fraud in the last 
election," Hardeman, a Los Angeles police officer, said at a news conference 
Tuesday outside City Hall. "Many voters are very intelligent, but some could be 
fooled by his masquerading as an incumbent councilman." 
</P>
<P>
The election code says candidates cannot pretend or imply that they are 
incumbents "when that is not the case." The code also gives the city clerk 
authority to challenge candidate's statements "upon clear and convincing proof 
that the material in question is false, misleading or inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Howard Rosten said he advised City Clerk Hermanita Harris not to 
make a ruling on Thomas' campaign statement because it is not a clear-cut case 
and "the government should not involve itself in free speech or election issues 
unless absolutely necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman's petition seeks to force the city clerk to delete all references to 
incumbency from Thomas' official statement before it is mailed to registered 
voters, along with the sample ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' statement says: "When you first elected me your councilman in 1987, you 
saw the difference between smooth talk and hard work." Later in the statement, 
Thomas says: "Thank you for voting to reelect a good neighbor -- a great 
councilman -- Tony Thomas." 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman's attorney, Mark Borenstein, said Thomas' campaign statement is 
"absolutely inconsistent" with Superior Court Judge Leon Savage's 1987 decision 
annulling the election results and revoking Thomas' certificate of election. 
Borenstein said it was a "quirk" in the election law that allowed Thomas to 
remain in office pending appeals in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas did not return several telephone calls this week, but he said previously 
that he disagrees with the court's decision to annul the election and does not 
believe he was implicated in any illegal activities. He said he plans to run on 
his record during his two years in office. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' attorney, Robert Stroud, called Hardeman's petition "trivial" and an 
attempt to gain more publicity for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Stroud said Thomas was elected in 1987 and did make legal votes on the council 
for almost two years, while the case rose through the courts. He said the 
dispute over the wording on the campaign statement could have been best 
resolved if Hardeman had simply talked to Thomas about his objections. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on Hardeman's petition is scheduled for early August, Borenstein 
said.

RANCHO P.V. TOLD OF GOLF COURSE BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes officials were told this week that a proposed public golf 
course along the city's coastline would have a bright economic future. The 
course, which has yet to be approved by the City Council, would be a 
cooperative venture between the city and two private developers and would 
combine public parkland and privately owned property. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the City Council Tuesday, Economic Research Associates of Los 
Angeles said the South Bay area -- which has five public golf courses that 
operate at near capacity -- could support up to five more. 
</P>
<P>
The consulting firm, describing its projections as conservative, said 
anticipated annual revenues of $5.8 million from the proposed course would 
cover operating expenses and debt service on 30-year, tax-exempt construction 
bonds. With a projected 1992 opening, the course would begin producing a profit 
after five years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a feasible venture from an economic view," said Gene P. Krekorian, 
vice president of Economic Research Associates, who said the company has done 
many economic studies of golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Workshop Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a golf course design consultant told the council the course 
would be ideal for the average recreational golfer. "The setting is 
magnificent," said Don Knott, vice president of the Robert Trent Jones II firm 
of Palo Alto. "It has the potential to be a wonderful, fun, enjoyable, exciting 
golf course." 
</P>
<P>
The city paid $9,000 for the economic study, while the two developers financed 
the $40,000 design study. 
</P>
<P>
The council has scheduled an Aug. 7 workshop to discuss the consultants' 
reports in detail and begin the process of deciding whether to pursue the golf 
development. The concept already has drawn support from some residents, who say 
it will provide needed golf facilities and open space, and criticism from 
others, who contend it will improperly benefit private developers. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop will be at 7:30 p.m., but a location has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 18-hole golf course, which Krekorian estimates would cost $19 
million, including interest on the financing package, would cover 140 acres. 
Included are undeveloped portions of Point Vicente Park, the present City Hall 
complex on Hawthorne Boulevard, some 40 acres of the former Marineland site 
owned by the Monaghan Co., and 45 acres owned by the VMS/Anden Group north of 
the Point Vicente Interpretive Center. 
</P>
<P>
The golf course would tie into Monaghan's proposed resort hotel and conference 
center development and the 95-home project VMS/Anden is planning. The ERA 
economic study assumes that the developers will dedicate the needed land to the 
city and the project will involve no land acquisition costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New City Hall 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they have not begun detailed discussions with the 
developers about how the golf course would be put together. 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the course would have a 12,000-square-foot clubhouse 
with banquet facilities for 300. A new City Hall also would be built as part of 
the project and the present complex demolished. Initially, 45,000 rounds of 
golf a year are expected to be played, increasing to 65,000 in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the two-tier fee schedule, Rancho Palos Verdes residents would pay less 
than others, including hotel guests. The hotel, however, would be entitled to 
one-third of the course playing time. The study is predicated on the hotel 
having 500 rooms, although the developer is proposing an eventual total of more 
than 1,000 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Residents would pay $25 to golf during the week and $35 on weekends, and others 
would pay $45 and $60, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The study projects annual revenues of $650,000 from the pro shop, $325,000 from 
food and beverage sales and $750,000 from banquets. 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, anticipated rounds of play are well under the average 
100,000 annually at each of the three major 18-hole South Bay public golf 
courses -- Los Verdes in Rancho Palos Verdes, Alondra in Lawndale and Victoria 
in Carson. Fees, however, are higher, even with the discount for Rancho Palos 
Verdes residents. The three charge $17 weekdays and $20.50 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay's other major course open to the public is the Palos Verdes 
Country Club in Palos Verdes Estates, which serves the public after 9 a.m. on 
Mondays and 3 p.m. on other weekdays. There also is the nine-hole Harbor Park 
course in Harbor City. 
</P>
<P>
While the council has yet to discuss the golf proposal in detail, several 
concerns already have surfaced -- ranging from whether the parkland may be used 
for a golf course to whether flying golf balls will endanger walkers and 
traffic on Palos Verdes Drive South, an existing major road that would snake 
through the course. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Permission 
</P>
<P>
Once a World War II military installation and later a Nike missile site, Point 
Vicente Park was deeded to the city by the federal government for public 
recreation. The city initially intended it for passive recreation, and a new 
plan for a golf course would require federal permission. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Dennis McDuffie said the Department of the Interior has indicated 
the course would be acceptable, but City Atty. Ariel Calonne said specific 
federal approval must be obtained before a decision is made. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the two developers must also work out a binding agreement ensuring 
that the private land involved in the project will always remain part of the 
public golf course. 
</P>
<P>
The city also must determine if trails along the coastal bluffs and the road, 
which the city considers desirable in coastal developments, could be safely 
included in the golf course project. Calonne said the city has to look closely 
at all potential safety and liability problems relating to trails and the road. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert Ryan said that because the course would be on a large chunk 
of public land, the city may invite discrimination lawsuits by people who 
object to residents getting a price break. 
</P>
<P>
The city paid $9,000 for the economic study, while the two developers financed 
the $40,000 design study.

WESTERN WALK OPTS FOR A NEW NAME INSTEAD OF A SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to warnings that they should tread lightly on the legendary and 
star-lined Hollywood Walk of Fame, backers of the Newhall Western Walk of Fame 
have agreed to change the name of their sidewalk tribute. 
</P>
<P>
From now on, the walkway along San Fernando Road will be known as the Newhall 
Walk of Western Stars, said Bob Martin, who heads the committee that maintains 
the landmark for the Downtown Newhall Merchants Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The association agreed to change the name after two years of prodding by the 
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which has copyrighted not only "Hollywood Walk 
of Fame" but "Walk of Fame" as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sore Spot 
</P>
<P>
The name of the Newhall walkway has "kind of been a sore spot for them for a 
couple of years," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
It's doubtful that anyone could confuse the two tourist attractions. The 
Hollywood Walk of Fame, now 29 years old, had 1,895 stars at last count. 
</P>
<P>
The 8-year-old Newhall walkway -- bronze plaques embedded in concrete -- honors 
25 Western celebrities from the famous, such as Gene Autry, to the less 
well-known, such as stunt man Andy Jauregui. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the Newhall walkway was started to celebrate Newhall's Western 
heritage. The former frontier town, now a part of Santa Clarita, was a backdrop 
for many early Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Lewis, who oversees the marketing of the Hollywood Chamber's landmark, said 
the Chamber has never filed a lawsuit to protect its trademark but has 
persuaded some organizations to not use the phrase "walk of fame" in the past. 
But this is the first time a group has agreed to change the name of an already 
established walk of fame, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concrete Slab 
</P>
<P>
Still unresolved, however, is the fate of a large concrete slab that announces 
the Newhall Western Walk of Fame to motorists along San Fernando Road. "They 
have got to change it," said Larry Kaplan, president of the Hollywood Chamber. 
</P>
<P>
But Martin said it's unclear who will pay for a new sign. The marker was 
installed by Los Angeles County and now belongs to the city of Santa Clarita. 
The two business groups are negotiating the matter. Asked if the Hollywood 
Chamber might pay for a new sign itself, Kaplan said, "Our attorney is talking 
to their attorney."

L.A. COMPROMISES TO KEEP SUNSHINE CANYON OPERATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with the possible closure of the only city-owned dump, the Los Angeles 
City Council unanimously agreed Wednesday to a compromise with operators of the 
privately owned Sunshine Canyon Landfill that will help the facility remain 
open for several more years. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members said they had little choice but to agree to an operating 
extension for the landfill, despite resistance by city zoning and planning 
officials to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
State-imposed limits on operations at the city's Lopez Canyon Landfill had 
pushed city officials into a corner last week when they learned that the dump, 
where two-thirds of the city's trash goes, may have to reduce operations or 
shut down. Sunshine Canyon is a standby destination for some of those 4,000 
tons of daily trash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Under the Gun' 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Los Angeles is under the gun," said Councilwoman Joy Picus. "This 
does help us meet our needs and give us time to plan for the future." 
</P>
<P>
The compromise satisfied representatives of the landfill owner, Browning-Ferris 
Industries, who had predicted at least a temporary closure of the San Fernando 
Valley dump if the city refused to extend a December deadline for many changes 
and improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something we can live with," said attorney Christopher Funk, who 
represented Browning-Ferris. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the compromise was a six-month extension of the deadline -- from 
December, 1989, to June, 1990 -- for Browning-Ferris to move its trash disposal 
to a northern area of the dump, away from homes in neighboring Granada Hills, 
as required last year by the city zoning administrator's office. The extension 
will be reviewed monthly by the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Necessary Permits 
</P>
<P>
Funk said the extra time is needed to apply for the necessary city, county, 
state and other permits and to prepare the northern area. 
</P>
<P>
For the dump to remain open through the end of its 1991 permit, the company 
still must comply with other requirements by December, including applying for 
permission to keep the height of the dump at 1,724 feet and keeping litter and 
dust out of residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Landfill opponents said the timing favored Browning-Ferris, which during the 
past year had consistently encountered resistance to its requests from various 
city boards and commissions. "The feeling I get is we didn't completely win, 
but we got a little bit," said Mariko Gueringer, an opponent of the dump who 
lives a mile from the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Several homeowners said they fear that the compromise paves the way for future 
Sunshine Canyon expansion onto county land owned by Browning-Ferris. Funk, the 
company's attorney, said the dump could remain open up to 35 more years if that 
expansion ultimately is allowed. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Hal Bernson, who proposed the compromise even though he 
ultimately wants to see the dump closed, said Wednesday's outcome could have 
been much worse for landfill opponents. Originally Browning-Ferris had appealed 
the zoning administrator's entire ruling, saying the company should not have to 
comply with any of the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a good opportunity to lose this whole thing, in light of Lopez," 
Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also complained that they were outgunned by lobbyists hired by 
Browning-Ferris, who have been manning phone banks to generate community 
support and meeting with council members for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a few hundred dollars versus quite a few thousand 
dollars," said Don Mullally, a Sierra Club member and Granada Hills resident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buttons and Stickers 
</P>
<P>
During the council meeting, about 50 people wore anti-Browning-Ferris buttons. 
Most of them were Granada Hills residents and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
A nearly equal number of landfill supporters filled the other side of the 
council chambers wearing "YES Sunshine Canyon" stickers. They ranged from 
Browning-Ferris attorneys to the dump's security guard and two women from 
South-Central Los Angeles who said they feared that limiting the landfill would 
increase illegal dumping in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Browning-Ferris spokesman Mark Ryavec said the two women were among 
those contacted by Browning-Ferris representatives during the company's 
lobbying effort. 
</P>
<P>
City action against Sunshine Canyon began in September, 1988, after Bernson 
asked zoning officials to investigate neighbors' complaints, including those 
about airborne dust and litter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Testimony 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the council Wednesday, company attorney Linda Bozung 
suggested that zoning officials were unfairly influenced in their earlier 
rulings by photographs supplied by the community, supposedly showing clouds of 
dust from the dump. 
</P>
<P>
She described the photos as out of focus and out of date. "They show what can 
very well be haze," Bozung said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mullally, who works as senior gardener at nearby O'Melveny Park, said that 
when winds blow off the Santa Susana Mountains, the park air is filled with 
clouds of dust and "at times windblown trash comes down almost like a 
snowstorm."

SIMI POLICE UNION REACHES TENTATIVE PACT WITH CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley police union reached a tentative contract agreement with the 
city Wednesday night, apparently ending a three-week deadlock, but details were 
not made public. 
</P>
<P>
An emergency meeting of the Police Officers Assn. was called immediately so 
members could vote on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very optimistic that the agreement will be ratified by a majority," 
predicted Officer Blair Summey, the union's president. 
</P>
<P>
Union attorney Stephen Silver would describe the tentative pact only as "a 
respectable contract for both sides." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Week to 10 Days 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Personnel Director Laura Wylie said that if accepted by the union, 
the pact would be presented to the City Council "within the next week to 10 
days." 
</P>
<P>
The council might consider the agreement at its regular meeting July 24, but 
only if the paper work and language of the contract are completed, Wylie said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement appeared to end a labor dispute that peaked Monday at a crowded, 
emotional council meeting attended by about 200 police officers, their families 
and friends. Police and their supporters protested the lack of a contract and 
voiced concern over threats made last week that the council might consider 
replacing the city's police force with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Summey said he believed that the large turnout prompted both sides to end a 
three-week break in talks and return to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
The 85-member police force has worked without a contract since July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The union sought a workweek of four 10-hour days and a wage scale tied to the 
average police pay in Southern California cities of comparable size. The base 
pay for a patrol officer in Simi Valley is $26,472 a year, and for a sergeant 
it is $34,608.

JURY AWARDS $35,000 TO VICTIM OF '83 SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a ruling that pleased neither plaintiff nor defendant, a Torrance Superior 
Court jury has awarded $35,000 in damages to Armando Estrada of Los Angeles for 
injuries he suffered occurred in a 1983 shooting by a sheriff's deputy near 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found at the end of a nine-day trial that the county and Sheriff's 
Deputy Richard Garcia were negligent in the shooting of Estrada, now 25. But 
the jury also found Estrada negligent and said he should share the blame for 
the shooting, which left him with severe head and neck injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who has bullet fragments lodged in his neck, had testified that he 
still suffers from neck pains, headaches and sinus problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relieved It's Over 
</P>
<P>
Estrada could not be reached for comment. But Winston K. McKesson, Estrada's 
lawyer, said Monday that the jury award was too little and that jurors may have 
been influenced by a doctor for the plaintiff, who testified that a sinus 
operation costing just $13,000 would solve Estrada's medical problems. McKesson 
and his co-counsel, Eric G. Ferrer, had asked the jury to award Estrada 
$350,000. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said Monday that he is relieved that the case is over, but that he still 
feels that he acted correctly in the incident. "I felt the shooting occurred 
solely because of Mr. Estrada's actions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said it was difficult for jurors to assess the action he himself took 
because he was not permitted to testify about a previous encounter with 
Estrada. The deputy had arrested Estrada several weeks before on a drug charge, 
and the two had scuffled. Estrada eventually pleaded guilty to resisting arrest 
and spent 16 days in County Jail, said Deputy County Counsel J. Patrick Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
The jury announced its verdict last week after Estrada and Garcia offered 
strikingly different accounts of their confrontation on May 17, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia testified that he was patrolling with his partner in a neighborhood 
around Vermont Avenue and 111th Street that he called rife with gang activity, 
when the Sheriff's Department broadcast a report that shots had been fired. 
</P>
<P>
At about 1 a.m., the two officers stopped a car whose four occupants they 
suspected might have been responsible for the gunshots. One of them was 
Estrada. The deputy said that as Estrada lunged at him in an apparent attempt 
to take his .357-magnum revolver, it went off. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada denied in court that he lunged at the deputy, saying he was complying 
with all of Garcia's orders when the deputy shot him. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found that Estrada suffered $70,000 in damages, but that he should get 
only half that amount because he was 50% responsible for the shooting.

COUNCILMAN ASKS TORRANCE TO STUDY REGULATION OF ASIAN 'HOSTESS BARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned that two "hostess bars" catering to Asian businessmen might provide a 
base for prostitutes, Torrance City Councilman George Nakano has asked the city 
staff to study how to regulate the bars or limit their number. 
</P>
<P>
Nakano made his request at Tuesday's council meeting. Hostess bars, which are 
mainstays in Japanese and Korean cities, provide female drinking companions for 
businessmen in an intimate late-night atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews Wednesday, a police official and Nakano said there have been no 
major problems of any kind at the city's two hostess bars, though both 
expressed concern that the clubs could foster prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the two hostess bars could not be reached Wednesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Nakano said he would like to see hostess bars completely prohibited in 
Torrance, but knows that would be legally difficult to do. Instead, he proposed 
that the city "do something before we get more of these places. . . . I don't 
think they are needed in our community." 
</P>
<P>
Typically in such bars, the hostesses sit with the businessmen, pouring drinks 
when glasses are empty, making small talk and telling jokes. The women work for 
salary, tips or both. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson said Wednesday that he has not studied the issue 
in depth, but said that before any regulations can be considered the city must 
define the difference between a waitress and a hostess. "It's going to take a 
long look," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nakano compares the hostesses to the "B-girls" of the 1940s, who hustled 
patrons for drinks. He said he would like to require licenses for hostesses, 
similar to those required for escort services in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Jim Weyant, who leads vice and narcotics investigations for Torrance 
Police, said there have been occasional reports of disputes and squabbles at 
the bars, but he said that is not unusual for a drinking establishment. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bars is a private club on Crenshaw Boulevard in northeast Torrance, 
and the other, on Pacific Coast Highway near Hawthorne Boulevard, is open to 
the public, said Weyant. 
</P>
<P>
He said police have no evidence that there is prostitution at the hostess bars, 
but officers have been keeping them under close watch. "We are concerned over 
the possibility that these (bars) could be a cover for or lead to" 
prostitution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have absolute evidence that hostesses at these few places are 
anything other than a waitress that offers a little more friendly attitudes," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Weyant said he has no Asian officer trained to conduct that type of undercover 
investigation at the bar, but one could be borrowed from another law 
enforcement agency if evidence of prostitution is found. 
</P>
<P>
He said that hostess bars are a new phenomenon in Torrance and local laws have 
yet to address whether they require special restrictions and guidelines. "Right 
now the question before us is: Do we have an innocent cultural item that has 
arisen in our city or do we have some kind of illegal activity or police 
problem."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICY ON DRUGS, ALCOHOL OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Avalon City Council passed a resolution on drug and alcohol policy Tuesday 
by a 4-1 vote. Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith was absent. 
</P>
<P>
The policy, approved by city employee groups and city officials before the 
meeting, prohibits the sale or use of drugs and alcohol on city property. It 
also requires drug testing of prospective employees. Employees who are involved 
in an accident or are suspected of abusing drugs also would be asked to take 
the test. Those who refuse would be ineligible for drug rehabilitation benefits 
and could face suspension. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Chuck Prince said the policy was required by the federal Drug Free 
Workplace Act of 1988, which mandates the development of drug and alcohol 
policies by local agencies receiving federal funds.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN FOUND FATALLY SHOT ON PAXTON AVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is investigating the death of an 
unidentified woman who was found shot to death Wednesday on a street in the 
Lopez Canyon area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A passing Los Angeles police officer found the body of the adult woman at 3:36 
a.m. in the 12300 block of Paxton Avenue, Sheriff's Sgt. Bryan Williams said. 
That part of Paxton, in a small area of unincorporated county territory between 
Lake View Terrace and Pacoima, is routinely used by Los Angeles police officers 
driving between the two neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said detectives have not determined a motive for the shooting and have 
no suspects.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUNMAN SURRENDERS TO POLICE, ENDING STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood man barricaded himself in his condominium for more than two 
hours Wednesday after firing a gun while arguing with his wife, Los Angeles 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Tyson, 32, surrendered about 5 p.m. after talking with his wife and 
police officers by telephone, Sgt. John Stilo said. Tyson was questioned at the 
Police Department's North Hollywood Division station before he was transferred 
to Olive View Medical Center for psychiatric evaluation, Stilo said. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson did not fire the gun at his wife, police said. The bullet struck a piano 
in the home. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson's wife, Michelle, left the unit to call police about 2:40 p.m., Stilo 
said. Police decided not to enter after she told them her husband appeared 
suicidal and intoxicated and was a martial-arts expert, Stilo said. 
</P>
<P>
During the standoff, officers evacuated about 45 people from neighboring units 
at the complex in the 12200 block of Runnymede Street, Stilo said. There were 
no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Stilo said police will ask the city attorney's office today to charge Tyson 
with shooting a weapon in a grossly negligent manner. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the unit, officers found several automatic and semiautomatic rifles, as 
well as a high-powered rifle and several small-caliber guns, Stilo said.

IN BEHALF OF THE SALVATION ARMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear old Salvation Army! 
</P>
<P>
Marching alone, quietly minding His business, reaching out to the homeless and 
desperate poor with seldom a word said in their favor, other than vague 
references to "good works." 
</P>
<P>
My colleagues and I were rather wistful to notice no mention was made of the 
work of the Salvation Army among the well-deserved tributes made to the several 
other agencies with the homeless in the San Fernando Valley; these other 
agencies receiving the benefits of the walk-a-thon recently organized by the 
Valley Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
But for some reason that's quite usual. It's an army that bangs its drums and 
blows its instruments to glorify God and not its work in His behalf. 
</P>
<P>
However, for the encouragement of the tens of thousands of generous and loyal 
supporters of the army in the San Fernando Valley, this letter is just a word 
to remind them of certain facts. 
</P>
<P>
Every night of the year a minimum of 140 men (who would otherwise be homeless, 
and who are homeless when they come to us) are sleeping in clean beds in the 
Salvation Army's two Adult Rehabilitation Centers here in the Valley: 85 of 
them in the Van Nuys center and 55 in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Every week over 300 men, women and children who are homeless are provided with 
emergency food at the army's San Fernando Valley Corps Community Center on 
Victory Boulevard in Van Nuys. While emergency shelter is very limited in the 
Valley for adult men and women, the army is committed before God never to turn 
away a homeless child. Of the center's $500,000 budget for 1989-90, 
approximately $25,000 will be received from the United Way. We expect to spend 
every cent of that amount on motel rooms for homeless children and their 
parents for one, two or three nights. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 300-plus individuals who are not homeless but almost equally 
desperate are also helped with food and clothing at the Victory Boulevard 
Center every week. 
</P>
<P>
The "Good Samaritan van" driven by volunteers and stocked with 15 gallons of 
good nourishing homemade soup, 300-plus sandwiches, toilet articles and 
blankets (when we have them) goes out every Friday evening and visits the 
homeless in North Hollywood Park, Hansen Dam and the United Way building in Van 
Nuys. We've been going out for over four years now, and every week we serve a 
minimum of 100 men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Every Sunday evening at least 100 homeless gather in the Victory Boulevard 
Center at 4 p.m. for a rousing Christian Worship service and a home-cooked 
dinner which is served at 5. That's every Sunday. The army has a banner that 
proclaims, "At the Salvation Army it's Christmas 365 Days Every Year!" 
</P>
<P>
Finally, and most importantly, in the five years that I have had the pleasure 
of being associated with them, I have known of over 200 men, women and children 
who have knelt at the drumhead (which the army uses as an altar) and received 
Christ into their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
So, not to embarrass the organizers of the walk-a-thon but to keep the record 
straight, let's thank God for the Salvation Army. One of their slogans is 
"Heart to God, Hand to Man." Without the loving support of countless thousands 
of people, many of them readers of your paper, that hand to man would be empty.

LAWNDALE CITED BY AQMD FOR IMPROPER ASBESTOS HANDLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District cited the city of Lawndale this 
week for improperly handling asbestos materials during the demolition of three 
city-owned buildings last month. 
</P>
<P>
The city could be fined up to $25,000 a day as a result of its mishandling of 
the hazardous material during the three-day demolition, which occurred June 
26-28 at 167th Street and Osage Avenue, according to AQMD officials. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory tests showed that samples of tile from the demolition site had a 37% 
asbestos content, according to district spokesman Tom Eichhorn. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of asbestos that may have been released into the air could not be 
determined because it was not until June 30 that the AQMD received complaints 
about the problem, Eichhorn said. By that time, he said, "the dust had 
settled." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delayed Effect 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos has been known to cause cancer and is regarded as particularly 
insidious because it often does not produce symptoms until many years after the 
initial exposure. Its handling is regulated by federal guidelines contained in 
the "National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers do not know how hazardous a brief exposure to asbestos can be, 
according to AQMD spokesman Bill Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
"Science has found no one threshold of exposure below which you are safe from 
getting asbestos-related diseases," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale City Manager Jim Arnold said Tuesday he did not wish to comment on the 
citation until he had an opportunity to review it. AQMD officials said the 
citation was sent to the city by certified mail on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier interviews, city officials said they decided to undertake the 
demolition after a contractor who had been hired to do the job failed to show 
up. Arnold said that he and Public Works Director Jim Sanders, a civil 
engineer, had inspected the site before demolition and found no evidence that 
asbestos was present. 
</P>
<P>
Specially licensed contractors are normally called in to handle asbestos 
removal. Among the special procedures they employ is wetting down materials so 
that asbestos fibers are not released into the air, according to the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
The one-page notice of violation, made available to The Times, cites the city 
of Lawndale for four failures to: 
</P>
<P>
*Comply with federal requirements for the containment and removal of asbestos 
materials; 
</P>
<P>
*Provide AQMD officials with a notice, 10 days in advance, of plans to demolish 
the three storage structures; 
</P>
<P>
*Properly control asbestos emissions during demolition; 
</P>
<P>
*Deposit asbestos-containing waste materials at a designated waste disposal 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Eichhorn said that the AQMD's chief prosecutor's office will be reviewing the 
case in the next few weeks and could handle the violations in one of three 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
The case could be resolved by negotiating a settlement, by filing a civil 
lawsuit, or by prosecuting it in the criminal courts, Eichhorn said. Many cases 
are resolved by a settlement, he said. The maximum penalty that could be 
imposed is $25,000 a day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is up to the chief prosecutor whether Lawndale's case would be viewed as one 
violation or whether the fine would be tripled for the three days during which 
the demolition took place, Eichhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lawndale residents who live near the demolition site are worried 
about the impact the improper asbestos removal could have on their health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surfaces Covered With Dust 
</P>
<P>
June Mouzas, a supermarket checker who lives next door to the demolition site 
with her 86-year-old mother, said she has spent her vacation cleaning the house 
to remove any possible trace of asbestos. Because neighbors received no advance 
notice of the demolition, they left their windows open and inside surfaces 
became covered with dust, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've taken down all the curtains and bedspreads and washed everything," she 
said. "I've stripped everything down I could, washing the walls and even 
painting them. I just hope everything will be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, air cargo worker George Norman, said he is not sure what the 
AQMD ruling will ultimately mean to him, his wife and their 2 1/2-year-old son, 
Joshua. 
</P>
<P>
"What I want to know is, is my family OK or not?" he said in a telephone 
interview Tuesday. "The hard part about this is that it is a long-term 
situation. We may not be sick today, or tomorrow, but who knows what will 
happen down the line?"

IN THIS DISTRICT, SCHOOL GOES TO STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

Gang members, pregnant teen-agers, young mothers and other troubled youths who 
have dropped out of school may be able to attend a mobile classroom in their 
own neighborhoods this fall through a program being developed in the Norwalk-La 
Mirada Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The district, with the help of Charter Hospital of Long Beach, plans to bring 
education and counseling to up to 85 dropouts by converting a 26-foot 
recreational vehicle into a roving classroom. The mobile classroom would travel 
four days a week to various parts of the district, including many gang 
neighborhoods, in an effort to reach dropouts up to 18 years old, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to go to them if they don't come to us," said Carola Lueder, 
coordinator of youth services for Charter Hospital, which recently provided 
counseling to students at John Glenn High School in Norwalk after the slaying 
of star athlete and honors student Juan Enriquez. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counselor to Be Assigned 
</P>
<P>
Charter is providing the $47,000 motor home and plans to assign a counselor 
part time to the project, Lueder said. At least one full-time teacher, a 
teacher's aide and possibly another part-time counselor would be assigned from 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary proposal was submitted last month to the Board of Education, 
which approved the concept and instructed officials to return with a 
comprehensive proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an attempt to bring back those students who dropped out. It is not a 
final answer but it is a very significant step," said Howard L. Rainey, acting 
superintendent of the 18,000-student system. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988-89 school year, 417 students dropped out of school, according 
to district figures. Of those, 172 were sophomores, 174 juniors and 71 seniors. 
</P>
<P>
An existing dropout program provides independent study in which students work 
at home and return completed homework assignments to the district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program in San Jose 
</P>
<P>
The Norwalk-La Mirada project would be similar to a program started about 11 
months ago by the Santa Clara County Office of Education. The roving classroom 
program at Central Independent High School of San Jose mostly serves pregnant 
teen-agers or young mothers who have dropped out of school in the San Jose and 
Santa Clara areas. School officials used state lottery funds to purchase a used 
mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
Two teachers work six days a week, including Saturdays, traveling to mostly 
low-income communities to teach, said teacher Ralph Wigginton, 33, who thought 
of the idea. "We kept losing students, most of them to pregnancy. Something 
just had to be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Five students have graduated from the program, which started with 25 students, 
Wigginton said. There are 20 dropouts on a waiting list, and district officials 
are considering purchasing a second motor home, he said.

CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT PRIVACY; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITIES CREDIT-CHECKING BILL STALLS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A bill by Assemblyman Willard H. Murray (D-Paramount) to let gas and electric 
utilities join a centralized credit bureau to track down delinquent customers 
stalled this week after Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) assailed the 
proposal as "a major invasion of individual privacy." 
</P>
<P>
In response to Garamendi's objections, the Senate Energy and Public Utilities 
Committee on Monday delayed action on the measure until the Legislature returns 
to the Capitol after its four-week summer recess, which begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's bill has two key provisions. One is designed to ensure that a decision 
by a public utility to require a security deposit is based only upon the credit 
history of the customer and not a relative or roommate. 
</P>
<P>
The second part -- which prompted criticism from Garamendi -- would require the 
California Public Utilities Commission to authorize gas and electric utilities 
to participate in a centralized credit check system established in 1985 for the 
state's seven largest telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of Murray's proposal -- according to an analysis of the bill by the 
Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee -- is to help utilities locate 
customers who have failed to pay bills and moved to another part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Edison Co. Supports It 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Ross, a lobbyist for Southern California Edison Co., said his utility 
already shares credit information with other electric companies -- a program 
that last year resulted in Edison collecting $665,000 in unpaid bills. He said 
Murray's measure, which Edison supports, would allow the electric utilities to 
swap similar information with telephone companies and other utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Murray said Tuesday that his original aim was to abolish the requirement for 
utility security deposits, which sometimes pose a hardship, especially to poor 
people. Supporters say some utilities have sought deposits from new residential 
customers based upon the belief that a previous tenant, who failed to pay his 
bill, may have been a roommate of the new customer. 
</P>
<P>
Murray said that as a trade-off to remove opposition from utilities, the bill 
went beyond spelling out conditions for obtaining a security deposit to provide 
utilities "with access to central credit information." 
</P>
<P>
But in an interview Tuesday, Garamendi questioned the value of the trade-off 
because "on balance, the consumers aren't going to be better off." 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's committee hearing, Garamendi criticized the legislation, 
saying: "Mr. Murray, not to pick on you and your bill, but you're doing far 
more than just dealing with security deposits . . . and in my view it is a 
major invasion of individual privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi labeled the bill "a bad one, a real bad one" because "we're really 
going to hurt people. . . ." He also scolded Murray for "really putting Big 
Brother in place in a big, big way, with no consumer protection." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assembly Passed It 
</P>
<P>
Murray said he did not face similar criticism when the bill was in the 
Assembly, which approved the measure last month on a 70-1 vote. He brushed 
aside the objections, maintaining that the bill includes consumer protections 
because it prohibits public utilities from releasing, transferring or selling 
credit information or using it for marketing programs. 
</P>
<P>
Murray also said the intent of the bill is not to set up a new credit check 
system, but merely to utilize the system used by telephone companies. Phone 
companies exchange information to determine whether, for example, a customer 
who has skipped out on a bill is seeking telephone service somewhere else in 
the state, according to PUC officials. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, the Edison lobbyist, said the measure could help utilities lower costs if 
they could more easily locate customers who failed to pay their bills. If the 
legislation becomes law, he said, it would assure that "ratepayers don't have 
to subsidize people not paying bills."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
WITH MITCHELL OUT, MALDONADO LEADS GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is unlikely that either Tom Lasorda or Roger Craig is a better or a worse 
manager than he was a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last year everything worked right for Lasorda and the Dodgers became world 
champions. Nothing went right for Craig and the San Francisco Giants finished 
back in the pack. 
</P>
<P>
This season it is Craig with the magic touch and Lasorda's club that is having 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, Kevin Mitchell all of a sudden made like Babe Ruth, and hit home 
runs in bunches and drove in runs in batches. 
</P>
<P>
So, Mitchell's back became sore and swollen. All Craig did was push a button 
and Candy Maldonado emerged from a deep slump to become a more than adequate 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, with the best home record in baseball, completed a three-game sweep 
of the St. Louis Cardinals Wednesday with a 7-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado's two-run home run in the fourth inning broke a scoreless tie. He 
added a run-scoring single in a five-run fifth as the Giants held on for their 
fifth win in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell missed all three games, but Maldonado, hitting only .210 starting the 
series, was five for 11, scored four runs and drove in five. 
</P>
<P>
The Craig magic worked in the fifth when he sent up Greg Litton as a 
pinch-hitter and Litton hit a three-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Jeff Brantley. He doesn't always pitch very well, but since June 
29 he is 6-0, all in relief. In this game he lasted 2 1/3 innings, giving up 
three runs and six hits, but won. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Mitchell could have done more in this series than Maldonado," 
Manager Whitey Herzog of the Cardinals said. "He's gotten some big hits against 
us this year." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, who are 34-15 at home, are 57-37 overall, the best record in the 
majors and are 20 games over .500 for the first time in more than a decade. 
Maldonado is glad he's finally contributing. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are starting to fall into place," he said. "I've been waiting for a 
chance to help the club by coming up with some key hits. The main thing is that 
everybody's contributing." 
</P>
<P>
With Houston losing, the Giants, who finished 11 1/2 games behind the Dodgers 
in the West last season, lead the West by 4 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Craig may also get a bonus this weekend. Giant pitcher Dave Dravecky, who had a 
cancerous tumor removed from his left shoulder last year, is ready to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 9, Cincinnati 4 -- Mariano Duncan arrived in Cincinnati eager to 
help his new club and Manager Pete Rose put him at shortstop and batting 
leadoff. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan went 0 for five and the Phillies handed the slumping Reds their fourth 
loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Jordan went five for five and had one of four homers yielded by Tom 
Browning (7-9). Browning gave up 36 home runs in 36 starts last season. In his 
previous eight performances he had given up only one. But the four homers ran 
his total to 20 this year in 23 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Dickie Thon, Von Hayes and Randy Ready also hit home runs. 
</P>
<P>
New York 8, Houston 2 -- The Mets reached a low ebb Monday when they returned 
home to lose a doubleheader to the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, though, with help from Atlanta, the Mets have pulled to within three 
games of Montreal in the East. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at New York, David Cone continued his return to form and Darryl 
Strawberry hit his 20th home run. 
</P>
<P>
Cone (7-5) won his fourth in a row and pitched a four-hitter for his fourth 
complete game in 19 starts. He had trouble only with Glenn Davis, who hit two 
home runs and has 20 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when Davey (Manager Johnson) yelled at us the other night," Cone said, 
"he woke a lot of people up. I know I did." 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 3, Montreal 2 -- For the second night in a row the Expos let the Braves 
off the hook at Montreal and lost another game of their lead in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, with their best pitcher, Dennis Martinez, they blew a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
In this game, they loaded the bases with one out in the 10th, but Mike Aldrete 
struck out and Tim Wallach grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the 12th, Joey Hesketh (5-3) walked Oddibe McDowell, who stole 
second and scored the winning run on Tommy Gregg's single. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 9, Pittsburgh 1 -- Hot-hitting Chris James continued his assault on 
Pirate pitching at San Diego. Tuesday night, he hit a grand slam in a 17-4 
victory. In this one he hit a three-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Whitson pitched a three-hitter to improve his record to 13-6. He is 4-0 
against the Pirates. He won 14 in 1984 for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark doubled in the second inning to extend his hitting streak to 14 
games. Luis Salazar had a two-run home run and Benito Santiago a three-run 
triple. DAN HAFNER

LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL CELEBRATES ITS 50TH JUBILEE; 
</P>
<P>
POPULARITY OF SUMMERTIME RITUAL ENDURES

<P>
The boys of summer turned 50 this year, but they never lose a step or show a 
touch of gray. 
</P>
<P>
These boys of summer are the perpetually young products of America's fountain 
of youth, Little League baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1939, Little League is celebrating its 50th anniversary and has been 
in the Valley area for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although local leagues have done little to commemorate the anniversary, Little 
League has celebrated with a variety of national events, including a recent 
ceremony at the White House with a former Little League coach of some note, 
President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Little League, which originated in Williamsport, Pa., organized in San 
Bernardino in 1950 and preceded the arrival of the major leagues in California 
by eight years. The Brooklyn Dodgers, the original Boys of Summer, migrated 
westward in 1958. By then, Little League already had taken root in the Valley 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more organized now," said Jerry Goldfield, one of the coaches when the 
Conejo Valley Little League was chartered in 1960. "We had some rawhide back 
then. We had some real big country boys. It was good baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Now, more than 10,000 players aged 6 to 18 participate in area Little League 
programs that encompass parts of three of California's 63 Little League 
districts. District 13 covers the area from Simi Valley to Oxnard; District 40 
includes the San Fernando Valley and Canyon Country; and District 16 covers the 
Glendale, Tujunga and Sunland areas. 
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 youngsters participate in District 40 alone, and a major program 
like the Northridge Little League boasts a membership of nearly 1,000 boys and 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, girls. Little League Inc. was legally mandated in 1974 to include 
girls. Little League also has created softball divisions but not all area 
leagues offer softball. 
</P>
<P>
Girls tend to compete in younger age categories such as Tee-Ball for 6- to 
8-year-olds, but 15-year-old Liz Vriese of Canoga Park has excelled in the 
Woodland Hills-Sunrise Senior League. A Jill-of-all-trades, Vriese played 
pitcher, third base and other positions well enough to make the league all-star 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"The boys treat me as a boy," she said. "They treat me well. Opponents, they 
tease me and tell me a girl shouldn't be playing baseball but (should) be home 
putting on makeup or knitting. I tell them to mind their own business." 
</P>
<P>
The addition of girls and the expansion of the Tee-Ball division have helped 
keep Little League growing. Despite competition from other baseball and youth 
sports programs, Little League in the Valley area has flourished. One of the 
fastest growing areas in District 40 is Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we'll be able to grow much larger," said Dave Bench, president 
of Canyon Country Little League. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Canyon Country had to turn down 200 children who signed up late but 
was able to accommodate all those who met the registration deadline. 
Eventually, the league might have to cap its enrollment but officials hope to 
build more fields before reaching that point. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional Little League includes youngsters aged 9 to 12, but Tee-Ball 
(6-8), Senior (13-15) and Big League (16-18) divisions have been added. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're running now is more Tee-Ball teams than anything else," said Merle 
Sanders, District 40 administrator. "I would say we're extremely healthy and 
enjoying tremendous success and the future looks good." 
</P>
<P>
However, with sandlots becoming parking lots as the area population booms, 
Little League officials have scrambled for fields. 
</P>
<P>
"The big competition we have is for playing space," said Bruce Singleton, 
president of the Thousand Oaks Little League. "We compete for use of fields 
with softball leagues, soccer leagues, you name it. We have a facility with 
four fields, and we're running out of space." 
</P>
<P>
While finding fields presents a problem, sometimes the children at a Little 
League game are not just those on the field. As one Little League brochure 
notes: "It is in the deportment of parents at Little League games where the 
program draws its greatest criticism." 
</P>
<P>
The term "Little League parent" has come to connote overbearing adults who 
pressure their children in youth athletics. Yet "Little League parent" also 
refers to those dedicated parents who line the field, keep score, umpire, sell 
concessions and coach. 
</P>
<P>
Little League relies almost exclusively on volunteers, making parental 
non-involvement a problem as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Often it's gotten to be a kind of baby-sitters' program," said West Regional 
Director Frank Yost, "in that the adults are unwilling to participate and they 
expect a few coaches and administrators to carry the ball." 
</P>
<P>
An increased emphasis has been placed on training all parents, not just those 
who volunteer their time. Parents receive an instructional brochure to aid in 
player registration, and Little League publishes another pamphlet titled: "Role 
of the Parent in Little League." 
</P>
<P>
Kon Slettedahl, coach of the Woodland Hills-Sunrise Little League All-Stars, 
said that he has a mandatory parent meeting every year, during which he 
outlines his Little League philosophy and the role of parents on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have a real hard time with people who take it too seriously," 
Slettedahl said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and other adults walk a fine line between helping and hindering. At a 
typical Little League tournament game, the players are barraged by a Greek 
chorus of adult voices commenting on the action. 
</P>
<P>
"Five percent of the parents don't have the right perspective," said Dave 
Sehnem, a former Little League player and coach. "They have what I call 'love 
goggles.' They're prejudiced in favor of their son, and they make life 
miserable. It was the same thing 25 years ago when I was 12." 
</P>
<P>
Sehnem was not a typical 12-year-old, though. In 1963, he played for the 
Granada Hills National team that won the Little League World Series 
championship in Williamsport, Pa. No team from the Valley area has matched that 
achievement, and Granada Hills is the last California team to win the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
However, area Little Leagues have continued to produce outstanding players such 
as major leaguers Bret Saberhagen, Robin Yount, Kurt Stillwell and Rick 
Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say the quality right now is coming up again," said Slettedahl, in his 
10th year as a Little League coach. "We're getting some pretty good athletes in 
there. I'd say we're going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Reaching the Little League World Series usually requires two dominant pitchers 
and a certain amount of luck. An American team must win more than a dozen games 
just to reach the final eight in Williamsport. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 tournament began a week and a half ago at the district level where 
each league's all-star team competes in a double-elimination tournament. 
Winners advance to sectional, divisional and regional tournaments and, finally, 
Williamsport in the Little League Division. Tournaments are also held in three 
other baseball divisions -- Junior (13-year-olds), Senior and Big League -- and 
in softball. 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches don't wait until the all-star tournament to resort to tactics that 
would make Machiavelli blush. Sandbagging -- instructing a player to play 
poorly at tryouts to dupe other coaches -- and empire building -- stockpiling 
young talent -- are two of the tricks coaches employ in an effort to win their 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"They will sometimes do a lot of things that aren't in the book," said Sanders, 
the District 40 administrator. "Some of the adults will carry this stuff 
forever. I have a friend who's still talking about a situation in 1974. He 
talks about it like it was yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
Still, despite the cynic's view that Little League baseball has been spoiled by 
egocentric adults and their machinations on the sidelines, the area between the 
white lines remains, just as it has for the last 50 years, the kids' domain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of fun even when we lose," said 15-year-old Jeff Naster, who has 
nonetheless had his share of winning in helping Conejo Valley teams advance to 
divisional tournaments in Little League and Junior League. "It really helped me 
feel I can be the best at what I do." 
</P>
<P>
Little League is the kids' own field of dreams, and one where the boys of 
summer can still be boys . . . and girls.

WOODLAND HILLS BATS QUIET BURBANK, 13-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Burbank burst its upset hopes like a balloon with its own needling in the 
opening game of the American Legion District 20 tournament Wednesday at 
Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank entered the bottom of the sixth inning tied with Woodland Hills West, 
the top-seeded team, but about the time Burbank players began to pop off in the 
dugout, Jason Cohen and Ryan McGuire popped home runs and Woodland Hills won 
going away, 13-5. 
</P>
<P>
"When you wake the giant with the ragging, you know what's going to happen," 
said a disgruntled Pat Eggleston, the Burbank coach. "My guys opened their 
mouths; Woodland Hills opened their mouths and what happens, their guys can 
stand behind it. When you can't stand behind the ragging, you'd better shut 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Because the game included its share of extracurricular talking and posturing, 
the teams did not take part in the traditional postgame handshake. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our kids were asleep for awhile," Woodland Hills Coach Gary Gibson 
said. "One of the things that woke us up was that they started ragging us. It 
really got the kids' ire up. I think that had something to do with the game." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 5-1, in the sixth, Burbank put together three consecutive hits to 
open the inning. Joey Hiortdahl slapped a two-run single to right to ignite a 
four-run rally that tied the score, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills regained the lead with a run in the bottom of the sixth and then 
pulled out the heavy lumber. In the seventh, McGuire hit a double and scored on 
single by Del Marine. Cohen followed Marine by hitting a hanging curve over the 
left-field fence for a two-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills then loaded the bases in the eighth and McGuire delivered the 
first grand slam of his American Legion career. McGuire, a 6-foot-2 redhead, 
said he is sometimes mistaken for Mark McGwire's younger brother. He showed why 
by muscling an opposite-field shot to left. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to take a breaking ball the other way, and I hit it well," said 
the left-handed-hitting McGuire. "He threw the breaking ball, and I sat on it." 
</P>
<P>
Burbank starter Steve Trainor (7-3) struck out five in his three-inning stint 
but gave up three runs and took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Treend (5-1) pitched himself out of trouble in the sixth with a 
bases-loaded, two-out strikeout and held Burbank scoreless thereafter. He 
pitched a complete game to record the win. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat had a couple bad innings, but he hung in there," Gibson said. "He did a 
real good job today. I was just wondering when we were going to get the bats 
going. I knew it was only a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Bobby Kim had three of Woodland Hills' 14 hits, and four other players 
each had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a pretty good pitcher to beat us," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Encino-Crespi pitching staff will have the next opportunity to shut down 
the potent attack of Woodland Hills (20-3). The teams will play a second-round 
game today at 12:30 p.m. at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank (13-10) will try to stay alive in the double-elimination tournament 
when it meets Lancaster today at 12:30 p.m. at Pierce College.

SILVA'S STATURE GROWS IN WIN OVER SUN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he stands just 5-foot-7 and weighs only 140 pounds, pitcher Oscar 
Silva continues to baffle Sun Valley batters. 
</P>
<P>
Silva, a right-hander who will be a junior at Canyon High, scattered seven hits 
and struck out four as Newhall-Saugus defeated Sun Valley, 12-2, in a 
first-round District 20 playoff game Wednesday at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Silva (2-1) limited Sun Valley to three hits en route to a 8-3 
win. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Silva received support from 10 Newhall-Saugus hits and six Sun 
Valley errors. The game was called after the seventh inning because of the 
10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall-Saugus (18-5) broke a 2-2 tie by scoring seven runs in the fifth, three 
of which came on a double down the first-base line by Scott Warr. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Whiteside had tied the score for Sun Valley (13-10) in the previous 
inning with a solo home run. 
</P>
<P>
Whiteside and Marlon McKinney each had two hits and Abel Trujillo had three 
hits to account for the Sun Valley offense. 
</P>
<P>
Shad Martinez was tabbed with six of Newhall-Saugus' seven runs in the fifth as 
well as the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall-Saugus will play Panorama City today at 4 p.m. at Birmingham High in 
the double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Panorama City 3, Woodland Hills East 0 -- Right-hander Rolland De La Maza held 
Woodland Hills East to three hits and struck out four to lift second-seeded 
Panorama City in a first-round District 20 game at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
David Garcia, who reached base on a bunt single, scored on Shane Wight's triple 
in the third. Herman Merchan drove in Adam Clark with a double in the sixth and 
Joey Cascione singled home Garcia in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Panorama City will play Newhall-Saugus today at 4 p.m. at Birmingham. Woodland 
Hills East will play Sun Valley today at 4 p.m. at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Encino-Crespi 4, Lancaster 2 -- Mark Venturine hit a single off Lancaster 
pitcher Mark Hartman's leg with the bases loaded in the sixth inning to score a 
run and help Encino-Crespi pull away in a first-round District 20 game at 
Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Encino-Crespi (14-9) scored on an error in the third and Victor 
Seper's single in the fifth before Venturine's shot and Chris Romero's 
sacrifice fly accounted for two in the sixth. Lancaster (15-8), seeded fourth, 
scored in the fifth and sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bennett, a right-hander who will be a senior at Crespi High, improved his 
record to 5-2 with the win. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Carroll collected his third save after Bennett walked the leadoff batter in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi will play Woodland Hills West today at 12:30 p.m. at Birmingham High. 
Lancaster will play Burbank today at 12:30 at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake-Agoura 8, Conejo 5 -- Dan Freedman and Mike Lieberthal each collected 
two hits and two RBIs as Westlake rolled in a District 16 regular-season game 
at Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake-Agoura (24-2-4), which has already clinched the district championship, 
answered Conejo's two-run first inning with two runs in the first, two in the 
second and three in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Bobby Kazmirski (5-0) scattered five hits and struck out five in 
five innings. Left-hander Mike Goldstein cleaned up by striking out three and 
allowing a hit in two innings of work. 
</P>
<P>
Freedman, Lieberthal and Joey Medaglia each doubled for Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
The game was called after seven innings because of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Christenson doubled for Conejo (8-10). Christenson was Conejo's starting 
pitcher and he was relieved by Mike Lee in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Each team committed four errors.

NATIONAL TRACK MEET MAKES STOP IN HOMETOWN OF PROGRAM FOUNDER; 
</P>
<P>
LOOKING FOR A RACE, PAIN BECAME MASTER OF THE MASTERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
David Pain thought it a shame that athletics were wasted on the young. So in 
1966, the La Jolla attorney did something about it -- he began Masters track 
and field. 
</P>
<P>
Pain's idea was simple. Allow athletes to compete against others their own age. 
Let 34-year olds run against no one younger than 30, 74-year olds against no 
one younger than 70. 
</P>
<P>
It was an idea that quickly caught on. Now, 23 years after its birth, Masters 
track and field has hundreds of thousands of competitors worldwide, Pain says. 
</P>
<P>
Some 1,600 of them are gathered here this week for the TAC/USA National Masters 
Championships, which begin today and run through Sunday at both San Diego State 
and Balboa Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the equivalent of rolling 20 track meets into one," said Dixon Farmer, 
the meet director and a former CIF state champion at 440 yards and the 180-yard 
low hurdles in 1958 and 1959. 
</P>
<P>
And of course, David Pain is right smack in the middle of organizing the 
monstrosity. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anyone who has such an attention to detail," Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
But could anyone expect something less than obsession from the father of 
Masters track? 
</P>
<P>
Pain was 45 in 1966 and realizing just how difficult it was to juggle a 
lawyer's calendar with a social calendar. 
</P>
<P>
"I was competing in handball at the San Diego Athletic Club," Pain recalled. "I 
enjoyed the game, but there's always problems with a court game, having to sign 
up for a court, be there at a certain time and only have one hour. As a lawyer 
it was pretty hard to say, 'I'll be there at 4 p.m.' and keep that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"So I started running, and the thought occurred to me, 'Why not have a Masters 
mile?' " 
</P>
<P>
Pain got ahold of Les Land, who at the time organized a track meet here. Land, 
too, asked, "Why not?" He consequently added an over-40 mile to his meet. Pain 
and several others competed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I pulled a muscle and pulled up lame in that one," Pain said. "But 
that's part of the game. In athletics, you have injuries." 
</P>
<P>
It was an inauspicious debut for Pain, who never competed in athletics in 
college or high school. But the injury did not hamper the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the San Francisco Examiner indoor meet, of the Los Angeles Sports 
Arena meet and finally the Millrose Games all asked the Master milers to 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I thought, 'Why not have a Masters track meet?' " Pain recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Though a success with some 400 athletes, the first meet -- held in San Diego -- 
did have some glitches, not the least of which was the fact that only a handful 
of the athletes were women. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to run all the women in one race because we didn't have enough in each 
age division," Pain said. 
</P>
<P>
There were also several events -- pole vault, hammer, triple jump and decathlon 
among them -- not included because Pain and others thought older athletes ought 
not attempt them. That was soon regarded as backward thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"We quickly learned that Master athletes could do all disciplines without 
exceptions," Pain said. 
</P>
<P>
Pain and his colleagues have been going forward ever since. How far? Well, the 
biggest-ever Masters meet will begin next week when more than 5,000 athletes 
from some 55 different countries descend on Eugene, Ore., for the world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"He just got this idea," said Linda Pain, David's wife, "and it took off." 
</P>
<P>
"Like the guy who invented the safety pin, or the guy who invented the paper 
clip," David added. 
</P>
<P>
But for those who participate, Pain's idea added more to life than just 
convenience. 
</P>
<P>
"The things people write to me makes me think we created something good for 
people," Pain said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best indication of that came two years ago at a banquet following 
the world championships in Melbourne, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"A gentleman went up to the microphone unannounced," Pain remembered, "and he 
said, 'I want everyone here to know that Dave Pain gave me a rebirth. He gave 
me a new life.' And he said it with such sincerity. There were so many people 
in the room who sort of said amen to that in agreement. It gave me a wonderful 
feeling to know that there were so many people whose life had been made better 
because of this program . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It gives people a forum in which they can compete regardless of age as long as 
they have a competitive spirit and athletic ability." 
</P>
<P>
Pain, now 67, still competes in the middle distances. His best year came in 
1971 when, at the age of 50, he ran 800 meters in 2:18.7, not world-class but 
respectable. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other athletes who will compete beginning today include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Paul Spangler. At 90, Spangler will be the oldest American competing (There 
will be some "guest" Finish athletes competing over that age). Spangler is a 
multi-record holder in the 10,000, 5,000 and "everything down to the 800 
meters," Pain said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Payton Jordan. Jordan, who coached at Stanford and the 1968 U.S. Olympic 
team, was a national-class sprinter at USC in 1939 but stopped competing after 
college. Until, that is, he turned 55 and entered the Masters program. At 72, 
Jordan has run the 100 meters in 12.9 seconds (hand timed). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Derek Turnbull. Turnbull is a 62-year-old sheep-herder from New Zealand who 
two years ago in Melbourne won five gold medals, in the 800, 1,500, 5,000, 
10,000 and marathon. After all the preliminaries and finals in those events, 
and just four hours after finishing the marathon, Turnbull came back for an 
encore and participated in an exhibition mile, finishing in less than five 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- James King of San Diego. King, who recently turned 40, set the world record 
in the 35-39 age group in the intermediate hurdles at 52.8. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Masters," Pain said, "athletes like James King would fade away. But 
now every five years he can look forward to new records and stay interested." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stan Whitley. Like King, Whitley is an intermediate hurdler. "He and King 
will be battling it out, and you'll see a new (Masters) world record from one 
of them," Pain promised. 
</P>
<P>
The meet already has taken a crooked turn. About 60 of 100 flags borrowed from 
Balboa Park's United Nations display were set up along San Diego State's track 
Tuesday afternoon. Sometime that night, they were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever did it had to jump the fence to get in there," said Steve Levon of The 
Athletics Congress. "It wasn't an easy task. They're going to cost between $25 
and $30 apiece to replace, so we'd be happy to take them back, no questions 
asked."

LAYOFFS EXPECTED AT MONITOR IF LEAR SIEGLER MERGER SUCCEEDS

<P>
Layoffs are expected at Monitor Technologies if the company's plan to merge 
with Lear Siegler Measurement Controls of Englewood, Colo., through an 
$8-a-share tender offer is successful. 
</P>
<P>
Monitor Technologies Chairman Kenneth Years said plans call for the San 
Diego-based manufacturer of air-pollution monitoring equipment to be moved to 
Englewood from its current Scripps Ranch base of operations after the 
completion of the tender offer. Just how many of Monitor's 100 employees will 
be affected by the move has not been determined, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lear Siegler's tender offer, announced by both companies late Tuesday, would be 
worth $15.9 million, Years said. Monitor now has about 1,987,000 shares 
outstanding. The tender offer commenced Wednesday and will expire Aug. 15 
unless extended. 
</P>
<P>
Monitor stock closed up $1.50 at $7.625 a share in over-the-counter trading 
Wednesday. The stock has sold for as low as $3.875 over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Describing Lear Siegler's offer as "not a fabulous price but a reasonable 
price," stock analyst Larry Selwitz of Cruttenden &amp; Co. in Newport Beach 
said he doubts that a competing tender offer will arise. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't anticipate a bidding contest," Selwitz said. Monitor "has about 
a $4-per-share book value, and I don't know if anyone else is willing to pay 
two times book value for Monitor. (The firm's) growth rate is 8% to 12% a year, 
which is really no great shakes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Board Approved Merger 
</P>
<P>
Monitor's board of directors approved the merger Tuesday, the same day that 
Lear Siegler signed option agreements with all but one of Monitor's directors 
and officers to buy their stock. Monitor's officers and directors own 13.7% of 
the outstanding Monitor shares. 
</P>
<P>
Among the executives signing the option agreements with Lear Siegler was Years, 
who owns about 10% of the company's stock, a holding now worth more than $1.5 
million. Years said he expects to resign 
</P>
<P>
from the company once the tender offer is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Although Years would not receive a "golden parachute" or cash settlement from 
Lear Siegler, he said the Colorado company would honor his $145,000-a-year 
employment contract through the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury Asset Management Group, a British investment firm that recently 
disclosed that it owns more than 8% of Monitor shares, has not signed an option 
agreement with Lear Siegler, Years said. 
</P>
<P>
Although small and growing slowly, Monitor Technologies has been steadily on 
the rebound since 1986 when it lost $2.4 million on sales of $9.6 million after 
abandoning an automated inspection product line. For the fiscal year ended Dec. 
31, Monitor reported a $1.8-million profit on $11.1 million in sales. For the 
first quarter ended March 31, Monitor posted a $282,366 profit on sales of $3.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The company's outlook brightened recently after President Bush disclosed his 
environmental initiative that could lead to tougher pollution controls and 
perhaps more demand for Monitor's equipment. More than 80% of Monitor's 
equipment is now sold overseas, particularly in Europe, where more stringent 
monitoring controls are already in place. 
</P>
<P>
Years said the merger with Lear Siegler is a good fit because Lear Siegler 
makes equipment that monitors continuous pollution emissions from smokestacks 
and Monitor's machines measure ambient or atmospheric pollution. Lear Siegler 
is strong in domestic markets, while Monitor's strength is in exports.

DINGELL: NAVY PERMITS USE OF SUSPECT SWITCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHACHTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy ignoring Pentagon investigators' warnings -- has permitted a missile 
manufacturer to continue using electronic switches whose faulty production by a 
small Southland firm could render the missiles' warheads useless, the head of a 
congressional oversight panel has charged. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich), in a letter released Wednesday, asked Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney to order independent testing of the inexpensive switches 
made by Asher Engineering Corp. in Baldwin Park to determine the harm, if any, 
done by alleged shoddy manufacturing practices. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst case, Dingell warned, flaws in the switches could the "recall of 
seven years of missile production." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported in March that Asher's failure to properly test the tiny 
switches, which cost less than $20 each, had Pentagon officials concerned about 
the effectiveness of many of the tactical missiles in the U.S. arsenal. The 
switches are a critical piece of the firing mechanisms in Phoenix, Harm, 
Harpoon, AAMRAM, Standard, Sidewinder and Maverick missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its 
investigations subcommittee, said the Navy ignored critical audits of Asher by 
its own investigators in issuing a waiver last month that allowed Texas 
Instruments to install the switches in more than 350 Harm missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, the Navy's top quality-control official added his own 
objections, warning that test results to date did not justify using the 
switches and that their use posed "potential serious hazard to personnel, 
aircraft and missiles," according to an internal Navy memo released by the 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Sees No Problem 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department and Navy spokesmen declined to comment Wednesday on 
Dingell's letter. A Texas Instruments official, however, said the switches had 
been thoroughly tested and that none had failed. 
</P>
<P>
"The missile is warrantied, and we make sure the parts are good before we use 
them," said G. Dean Clubb, senior vice president and missile systems manager 
for Texas Instruments' defense systems and electronics group in Dallas. "There 
is no doubt in my mind these (switches) will certainly meet the needs of the 
missile system." 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Criminal Investigative Service has recommended that federal 
prosecutors in Los Angeles seek indictments of officials of Asher and Micronics 
International, a Brea company that is the prime contractor for the missile 
firing mechanisms of which Asher's switches are a part, according to William G. 
Dupree, the Pentagon's deputy assistant inspector general for investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell's letter said the Defense Department investigators have found that the 
switches did not meet military specifications, that they had not been tested 
correctly and that Asher was using equipment that had not been checked against 
Pentagon standards for as long as seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Asher, president of the firm, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
He told The Times in March that Micronics officials, under pressure from the 
military to deliver firing mechanisms on time, had ordered Asher employees to 
falsely certify that the switches met government specifications. 
</P>
<P>
Micronics since last fall has been the subject of a criminal investigation of 
alleged short cuts in its manufacture of firing mechanisms for the Phoenix 
missile. The Times reported in October that flaws in the devices had forced the 
Navy to mothball 500 missiles worth $425 million until replacement parts could 
be installed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passed Both Tests 
</P>
<P>
Micronics officials have denied any wrongdoing. G. Addison Appleby, chairman 
and chief executive of Micronics' parent company, La Jolla-based Precision 
Aerotech, said Wednesday that he knew of no grounds on which Micronics could be 
indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Like Clubb, Appleby said the Asher switches had passed tests conducted by both 
the Navy and independent labs. The only certifications signed by Asher 
officials, he added, were those requested by the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my understanding the problem is all in paper work," Appleby said.

The Supreme Court ruled that drug dealers, racketeers and others of that moral 
persuasion cannot use their ill-gotten gains to pay their lawyers when they get 
caught. The court declared that money made from drug trafficking does not 
belong to the alleged criminal. 
</P>
<P>
This means that many of our wealthy criminal lawyers are going to get cheated 
out of large fees, and clients may no longer be defended in the manner to which 
they have become accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it right or wrong?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
Rich, the lawyer, told me that the court's decision was wrong -- dead wrong. 
"Every person in this country deserves the best defense money can buy, no 
matter where his legal fee comes from." 
</P>
<P>
"What if it isn't his money -- suppose it's cash made in the underworld? Why 
should the person be allowed to defend himself with the funds he earned 
committing a drug crime?" 
</P>
<P>
"Who can be sure that it's drug money? Maybe it comes from an uncle who worked 
in HUD. The government is trying to destroy the defense of people they don't 
like, and also drive lawyers away from their waterfront homes in Miami Beach." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you upset because the Supreme Court is taking liberties with the 
Constitution, or are you more bothered because there is nothing left in the 
Brink's truck for you?" 
</P>
<P>
"That is the most insulting question anyone has ever asked. I want you to know 
that I would defend Noriega even if he couldn't pay me." 
</P>
<P>
"You're kidding," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, I'm kidding. What I don't like about all of this is that in the past, the 
big wheels in crime and dope always came to us first. Now they're going to some 
dumb ambulance lawyer instead. If the client approaches us, the government will 
assume that our client still has some ill-gotten gains hidden away." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't despair. The top crime figures are still going to have to hire you even 
if it means borrowing on their mother's Medicare insurance policies." 
</P>
<P>
Rich was optimistic, "I hope you're right. I hate to think of someone going to 
jail just because he couldn't afford me." 
</P>
<P>
"Is it easier to defend a man who can pay you than one who can't?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but I don't know why," he replied. "When I'm getting paid I feel good all 
over. If there's no fee, I feel as if I've got Lyme disease." 
</P>
<P>
"Will you still do a bang-up job if a person is indigent?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. I've never taken on anybody like that. Here's what I believe. 
When it comes to being defended, people should not have to explain the source 
of their money. Suppose that half of a defendant's income is derived from dope, 
and the other half from winning at bingo. I never question which part of his 
estate he's paying me from. I've had guys who paid me with suitcases of cash -- 
and I've always assumed that it was from the sale of their Pete Rose baseball 
cards." 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't get paid now by the bad people who are in trouble, how will you 
make your living?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to Texas and defend indicted savings and loan officers. Nobody would 
dare ask them where they got their money from."

LEGAL VIEW: AVOID PROBATE WITH A LIVING TRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There seems to be a fair amount of confusion about living trusts, an 
increasingly popular estate-planning device, if my mail is any indication. 
</P>
<P>
A recent letter from a woman in Lone Pine is fairly typical: "I always believed 
that if you had a will it was enough to protect you and keep your estate from 
going into probate. Now, I'm told that we need a 'living trust' as well in 
order to protect our property. Is this correct?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Probate Process 
</P>
<P>
She's half right. With only a will, and without a trust, the people she has 
selected to inherit her property will receive it. But the property will be 
distributed through the probate process. A living trust is not necessary to 
protect her property, but it can be used to avoid probate. 
</P>
<P>
Probate is not a bottomless pit. When your estate goes into probate, it doesn't 
mean that your heirs won't ever receive it. Probate is simply the 
court-supervised legal process used to implement the instructions in a will. 
</P>
<P>
But probate isn't free (executors and lawyers receive standard fees), and it 
isn't quick (it can take up to a year or more), which is why many people prefer 
to avoid it. A commonly used method to do that is a revocable living or inter 
vivos (Latin for "among the living") trust. 
</P>
<P>
A trust is a legal entity into which you can transfer all or any portion of 
your assets. When it is created, you name yourself as trustee, and in that 
capacity you control the property in the trust. After your death, the person 
you selected as "successor trustee" takes over control of the trust, and in the 
simplest version, then distributes the assets in accordance with your 
instructions in the trust document, without waiting for a probate court to 
approve the distribution. It can proceed quickly and with much less expense 
than probate. 
</P>
<P>
However, contrary to a popular misconception, everybody doesn't need a living 
trust. "It is not a panacea," says Scott Racine, an estate-planning and tax 
lawyer in Century City, who generally advises only his elderly or wealthy 
clients to choose a living trust over a will. 
</P>
<P>
And a living trust is not free, either. It usually costs more to have a lawyer 
prepare a standard trust and pour-over will, with fees ranging from $850 to 
$3,500, than a simple will. (A pour-over will takes care of any assets you 
didn't transfer to the trust.) 
</P>
<P>
You must make sure that your assets are properly transferred to the trust, or 
you'll find yourself in probate court anyway. If you own a lot of real estate, 
invest in a number of business ventures or partnerships, or even change your 
investments regularly, this can be a real paper work headache. And if you pay a 
lawyer to do it, it gets even more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if all of your assets are stocks and bonds held in one 
brokerage account, it is very easy to transfer that account to the name of the 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
A trust is helpful if you become incapacitated, because the successor trustee 
can handle your financial affairs without seeking a court-appointed 
conservator. And celebrities like trusts because they are private. Your assets 
are not listed in probate court records, which are open to public inspection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Decision 
</P>
<P>
Choosing between a living trust and a will is a personal decision, with no 
standardized formula applicable to all. It depends on your own financial 
situation, potential tax liability, the complexity of your portfolio, your age 
and other personal matters, even your personal tolerance for paper work and 
details. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody is going to have a nuisance, an expense, a pain in the neck," says 
John R. Cohan, an estate-planning lawyer who has authored a text for attorneys 
on trust drafting. "With a living trust, you have to live with it. With a will, 
your kids get it."

YOUR COINS: READER FLIPS OVER A QUARTER WITH REVERSE ON BOTH SIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: While searching through my laundry quarters for a 1989 flawed coin 
(missing its mint mark and the last 9 in the date, which was called "worth its 
weight in gold" in a recent news broadcast), I found a quarter with tails on 
both sides. Is this a joke coin or did the U.S. Mint make a mistake even more 
grievous than the above mentioned? Also, what's it worth? -- D.J.R. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Your letter helps point out both the negative and positive in today's 
numismatics. The negative deals with the hype connected with the revelation 
that a 1989 quarter had been discovered with a missing mint mark and other 
flaws. The media immediately jumped on this story and had people all over the 
country checking their quarters. After all, it was said, such coins were worth 
as much as $300. Or as you indicate, "their weight in gold." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this was not the case. In fact, it didn't take error-coin 
specialists long to determine that the problem was caused by a grease-filled 
die, a very common error indeed. So common, in fact, that this coin (plentiful, 
not rare) that had been touted as high as $300 only a few days earlier was 
downgraded to about $3. Now $3 for a 25-cent coin is still a hefty profit, but 
it's not the pot at the end of the rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
Some dealers who paid $50 or $100 or more for these error quarters are probably 
still trying to recoup their losses and charging inflated prices, which is 
where the negative comes in. Others are taking their losses, as well they 
should, and moving on to more conventional coin transactions, which is the 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
As for your quarter with tails on both sides, it's a manufactured piece made 
for magicians or flipping. Either way, it has no collector value. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Would you be so kind as to voice your thoughts on the slow, slow delivery of 
the United States Mint? -- L.W. 
</P>
<P>
A: I know it can be very aggravating to order coins and then wait for what 
seems an eternity before they arrive. Complaints are lodged from time to time 
regarding the mint's delivery service, and undoubtedly mistakes are made when 
you consider the millions of requests received annually. However, I believe on 
balance the mint does a pretty good job. Just be patient, or order early. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to know the approximate worth of the coin shown below. (The 
rubbing appears to be a Colonial half cent from Massachusetts, 1778.) -- T.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: Colonial coins were issued by the original Colonies in order to facilitate 
commerce. Massachusetts is probably most famous for the Pine Tree pieces, but 
they were not officially authorized, as your coin was. It's exciting to imagine 
early settlers actually handling such coinage. From the description, your coin 
is copper (not bronze as you indicate), although they were also made in silver. 
Such pieces are worth $75 and up, depending upon condition.

Although there are several holidays between now and then, Hallmark Cards has 
already booked the pre-Valentine's Day show for its "Hallmark Hall of Fame" on 
CBS. It will be "Face to Face," a romantic drama starring Elizabeth Montgomery 
and Robert Foxworth as two strong-willed people who fall in love in spite of 
themselves. The film was shot on location in Kenya. A Hallmark executive notes 
that the slot is important for the company because Valentine's Day is the 
second most popular greeting-card occasion of the year, behind Christmas.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO;

<P>
LEGENDARY SAX MAN NOT MOODY ABOUT NEW LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Legendary sax man James Moody moved to San Diego in April and had his first gig 
in his new hometown Wednesday night at Elario's. 
</P>
<P>
Moody came west from Jersey City to live with his new wife, Linda, a real 
estate agent here. The two tied the knot April 3 in a ceremony at Faith Chapel 
in Spring Valley. Dizzy Gillespie served as best man and played a few pieces, 
including the solo from "Con Alma" as the couple walked in. 
</P>
<P>
"I love her as big as the sky," said Moody, still madly in love and poetic as 
always. He first met his wife during a gig at Catalina's in Los Angeles. They 
didn't see each other for about a year, then they hooked up again when Moody 
came to town to play at Elario's last December. Sparks flew and Moody says he 
had a hard time touring a short time later without her. 
</P>
<P>
"I called her every day. My hotel bill in Egypt for the week. . . . Wow! I was 
sending her two or three faxes a day." 
</P>
<P>
Moody recently spent two weeks in Hong Kong playing The Jazz Club. His new 
album "Sweet and Lovely," dedicated to the new missus, is scheduled for an 
August release. At Elario's, where he will play through Sunday, he'll be backed 
by Sherman Ferguson on drums, Bob Magnusson on bass and a pianist (perhaps 
Harry Pickens, Randy Porter or Art Resnick). 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Lee Ritenour, who hits San Diego for Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay 
series Friday, feels strong ties to the music of Brazil. The best cuts on his 
last album "Festival" blend Brazilian melodies, rhythms and vocals with the 
driving funk of Marcus Miller's bass and percussion supplied by Brazilian 
Paulinho Da Costa. 
</P>
<P>
"Rit Colors," scheduled for fall release, also has some Brazilian flavor. 
Ritenour went to a funky studio in Salvador, in the Brazilian state of Bahia, 
to record a singer named Gonza Guinha for one cut. Most of the album's vocals 
are handled by Phil Perry, who will play with Ritenour in San Diego, along with 
Bob Wilson (former drummer in the fusion group Seawind), Ernie Watts on sax, 
Tim Landers on bass and Dave Witham on keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
Ritenour, also known as a top '70s studio musician for his work with Herbie 
Hancock, Steely Dan, Stanley Clarke and many others, has been a commercial 
success for years, but "Festival" is his hottest album yet. It has sold more 
than 200,000 copies since its release last October. 
</P>
<P>
With the earlier "Rio" and "Rit" both gold or close to it (500,000 copies), 
Ritenour is, along with Dave Grusin, one of the most commercially successful 
artists on the GRP contemporary jazz label, founded by Grusin and partner Larry 
Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
Talking Wood is a San Diego band built around the warm sounds of the African 
slit drum and is one of several bands scheduled to play the Second Annual Jazz 
Iz Forever, an all-day outdoor music festival this Saturday at the Educational 
Cultural Complex, 4343 Ocean View Blvd., in Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's concert was dedicated to local jazz singer Ella Ruth Piggee, who 
died of cancer. This year's is a tribute to Dr. Danny Scarborough, former head 
of the Afro-American Studies Department at San Diego State University and the 
director of the school's Black Repertory Dance Co. Scarborough, a prominent 
local educator, died of AIDS two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Other bands that will appear during the 12-hour celebration, which begins at 8 
a.m., include Hollis Gentry's Neon, Forecast, Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham and 
their Sweet Baby Blues Band, Swell, Reel to Real, Escola Brazilian Experience, 
Immediate Freedom Latin Jazz Ensemble, Glenn Horiuchi Quartet, Ayana Hobson 
Trio, Charles McPherson Jr. and the Lila Smith Trio. The band War ("Cisco Kid," 
"Slipping Into Darkness") is a special guest. 
</P>
<P>
Percussionists Bill Thompson and Gregory Blakney form the nucleus of Talking 
Wood. Besides the slit drum (which is played with mallets), Talking Wood also 
incorporates imbira (African thumb piano), gourd rattle, African claves, 
tom-toms, and, from Java, hank lungs (bamboo percussion instruments). 
</P>
<P>
The heavily rhythmic sound includes a lot of improvisation. Nonstop 
performances typically last a half-hour or longer. Talking Wood hits the stage 
a 9 Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Hank Young, the bass player who once backed Earl "Fatha" Hines, will 
lead a group Friday evening at 5:30 at Magee Park on Carlsbad Boulevard, three 
blocks north of Elm in Carlsbad. . . . Also on Friday, Fattburger will play at 
the Chula Vista Shopping Center's lunchtime concert series. . . . San Diego 
pianist Mike Wofford joins pianist Harry Pickens for the second session of 
Pickens' "The Art of Improvisation" series next Wednesday at 7 p.m., at The 
Athenaeum in La Jolla. . . . Tonight is the Gaslamp's monthly "Arts and Jazz 
Stroll," a self-guided tour of galleries, artists' lofts and jazz venues. Pick 
up a program at Faith Nightingale Gallery, 535 4th Ave., in the Gaslamp 
Quarter.

In a version of dueling game-show hosts, former "Hollywood Squares" host Peter 
Marshall filed a $1-million-plus suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court 
Wednesday against Burt &amp; Bert Productions, a company belonging to actor 
Burt Reynolds and game-show host Bert Convy. In the suit, Marshall claims he 
was bumped as host of the coming "3rd Degree" game show and replaced by Convy, 
who was not renewed as the host of the syndicated version of "Win, Lose or 
Draw." Marshall hosted the pilot for "3rd Degree" -- produced by Burt &amp; 
Bert Productions and Kline &amp; Friends, also named in the suit -- and says 
announcements were made that he would host the show for the fall season. "We 
never made a formal announcement that he would be on the show," executive 
producer Richard Kline said Wednesday in response to the suit. "We never even 
picked up the option to his contract." Kline said Convy was chosen when he 
became available because he reflects the young demographics "3rd Degree" is 
after. Marshall, whose suit alleges fraud and breach of contract, seeks 
compensatory and punitive damages. ALEENE MacMINN

HIGH-ENERGY DIESEL &amp; INJECTORS

If Bruce Springsteen retired, Bryan Adams never came back and John Cougar 
Mellencamp went techno-pop, then Johnny Diesel &amp; the Injectors, who 
headlined the Whisky on Tuesday, might really have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Diesel and his trio originated in Australia, but his Middle-American heartland 
rock is closer to Peoria than Perth. With a sax man wailing on the side, Diesel 
stormed through every Keith Richards chord and screaming guitar lead in the 
rock 'n' roll handbook as he wailed about the torments of love. But the most 
tension in the set was created by the 22-year-old Diesel's constantly breaking 
strings and switching guitars. This kid is really heavy-handed. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Diesel and the Injectors are a classic case of rock 'n' roll 
journeyman ambition. It's an ambition that believes in a mythology whose real 
adventure and challenge were sucked out of it when it became a cliched symbol 
of rebellion. For bands of this ilk, it's not a matter of how predictable the 
approach is, but how much energy they can infuse into those tired old formats. 
In that respect, the energetic Diesel has fuel to burn. But if you're looking 
for challenging twists or a sense of adventure, then this rock 'n' roll 
status-quo show was running on empty. 
</P>
<P>
Originality and innovation weren't the major concerns here. What really matters 
is that Diesel is young and cute and resembles Johnny Depp. And who knows? Even 
if he never quite reaches the heights of Bryan Cougar Springsteen, he could 
always become as big as Charlie Sexton. RAIG LEE

The cocaine-possession trial of Jamaican-born singer Grace Jones has been 
postponed in Kingston for the third time. The trial, which was scheduled to 
start Tuesday, had to be delayed because of a shortage of judges. It was 
rescheduled for Sept. 5. Jones was arrested April 8 and charged with possession 
of 18 grams of cocaine when police acted on a tip and raided a recording studio 
in Kingston. ALEENE MacMINN

The ashes of actor Laurence Olivier will be buried in Westminster Abbey among 
monarchs, prime ministers and great artists of past centuries, it was reported 
Wednesday. The Very Rev. Michael Mayne, dean of the church where England's 
kings and queens are crowned, said that a public memorial service for Olivier 
would be held in the abbey this autumn. No date for either event was given, but 
Mayne said that the burial and placement of a memorial plaque would be some 
time after the memorial service. Olivier died July 11 at the age of 82.ALEENE

BILL HENDERSON: FISHING FOR THE RIGHT BACKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the end of his opening set Tuesday at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill, singer 
Bill Henderson was wishing it was the end of his two-night stay. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the worst set, night of my entire . . .," he said in his dressing 
room after the set. "Nothing was happening." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, who came to fame in the 1950s with a recording of "Senor Blues" with 
pianist Horace Silver and further established himself with Count Basie, had 
indicated before the set that he would be trying some new and different things 
with his new trio. Unfortunately, the trio wasn't able to keep pace with the 
singer or provide Henderson with even the bare basics for his work. 
</P>
<P>
The opening tune offered the first indication of trouble. "That Old Black 
Magic" had Henderson singing in his usual, heavily syncopated style. To be 
effective, the band should have provided a smooth backdrop of easily loping 
swing for contrast. It didn't, and it got worse with the first ballad offering 
of the evening, "I've Got a Crush on You." 
</P>
<P>
Another swing tune failed to swing before Henderson turned back to the ballad 
and instructed bassist Jerry Watts Jr. and drummer Mike Shapiro to lay out. 
With Steve Bach at the piano, Henderson was finally in his element on Rodgers 
and Hart's "It Never Entered My Mind." 
</P>
<P>
And so the evening went. An up-tempo blues was murdered by Watts' overbearing 
bass and Shapiro's feet-dragging drumming; then salvation came in the form of 
"Sleeping Bee," the first of two ballads from the pens of Truman Capote and 
Harold Arlen. "Say That You'll Be Mine" was supposed to swing and didn't, nor 
did "Tulip or Turnip." But the ballads "Sophisticated Lady" and "Prelude to a 
Kiss," both from the Duke Ellington song book and accompanied only by pianist 
Bach, were gorgeous efforts that had Henderson at his lyrical best, his 
phrasing as on-the-money as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, the band came to life during a closing "The More I See You." But 
just as strangely, the band's wake-up call seemed to be for another date at 
another place with another singer. 
</P>
<P>
Chalk it up to a bad night? Of course, but Henderson is too good to work with 
inferior players. Pianist Bach showed himself a capable player -- a good catch, 
as it were. Henderson should throw the others back.

STAGE WATCH : THE ODYSSEY BEGINS MOVE TO NEW QUARTERS; '6 WOMEN WITH BRAIN 
DEATH' GOING TO BACKLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Odyssey's odyssey begins this week as the Westside theater makes its first 
moves out of its old quarters and into its new digs at 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
One of the theater's three current shows, "Disability," will close Saturday. 
"Kvetch" and "Personality" will close temporarily on the following Saturday, 
July 29, but will then move to Sepulveda. The tentative reopening dates are 
Aug. 11 ("Kvetch") and 12 ("Personality"). 
</P>
<P>
The first new production to open on Sepulveda will be Brian Friel's "The Faith 
Healer," scheduled for Aug. 26. Christopher Neame will take the title role; 
also in the cast are Judy Geeson and Neil Hunt. A series of monologues about an 
Irish mystic, Friel's play was on Broadway for 20 performances in 1979 starring 
James Mason. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who wants a souvenir of the old Odyssey should take a look at the props, 
costumes and other merchandise offered at the theater's parking lot sale, 
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., in the lot west of the Ohio Avenue building. 
</P>
<P>
In other Odyssey news, Sue Reinish of Chatsworth won the theater's "Grand 
Kvetch-Off," a spirited complaining contest that climaxed a two-month 
"Kvetchathon," in which audience members at "Kvetch" could offer their own 
brief kvetches after the show. Members of the cast judged the "Grand 
Kvetch-Off," as well as the nightly whines. 
</P>
<P>
Reinish's winning kvetch was on the subject of the non-synchronized time clocks 
of herself and her husband Shelly. 
</P>
<P>
MORE MOVES: The Los Angeles production of the musical revue "6 Women With Brain 
Death, or Expiring Minds Want to Know," which recently played two months in a 
rented 99-seat space at Los Angeles Theatre Center, will reopen at the 200-seat 
Backlot Cabaret in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The engagement will begin with an AIDS benefit Aug. 4, then preview Fridays and 
Saturdays through August, with the opening slated for early September. 
</P>
<P>
New to the cast are Patty Holley and Sharon Murray (who was in the first cast 
in San Diego, where the show will finally close Sunday, after 520 performances 
dating from October, 1987). They replace Mary Bond Davis and Cathy Susan Pyles, 
respectively. The women will be working under an American Guild of Variety 
Artists contract. 
</P>
<P>
The show will be streamlined with the deletion of a first-act number about a 
soap opera fanatic; producer Nan O'Byrne's eventual plan is to do two 
performances on weekend nights. The ticket price will be lower than at LATC: 
$15, compared with $22-$25. However, the Backlot's two-drink minimum will 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
In other moves, the Theatre 40 production of Agatha Christie's "The Unexpected 
Guest" goes to the Tiffany for a July 29-Sept. 3 engagement; two of the three 
producers are in the cast. And Michael Kearns' "Intimacies" will open at 
Theatre/Theater for an Aug. 6, after a run last month at Highways. 
</P>
<P>
CARLA'S BIG BREAK: When he saw the second preview of Howard Korder's "Boys' 
Life" at Los Angeles Theatre Center, Jack Tantleff had a question for LATC's 
Bill Bushnell: 
</P>
<P>
"Where's Carla?" 
</P>
<P>
Tantleff is Korder's agent, and he knew that a character named Carla is 
supposed to show up in the last scene. But she wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that LATC was using an early version of the script -- written 
prior to revisions that Korder made when the play was staged at Lincoln Center 
in New York last year. Upon hearing of the later version, Bushnell promptly 
hired an understudy, Roxanne Augesen, to play Carla and changed the ending. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a mistake," said Tantleff, when asked about the incident. 
"Obviously I was horrified. But to the theater's credit, they rectified it 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Bushnell declined to say which ending he preferred. "I don't have any choice," 
he said. "In the theater, we lease scripts, we don't buy them." 
</P>
<P>
ALSO AT LATC, Christopher Durang has bowed out of the role of Matt in his "The 
Marriage of Bette and Boo," opening Aug. 11. According to director Dennis 
Erdman, Durang's withdrawal from the cast was due to a conflict with a movie 
he's writing, "The Adventures of Lola." However, Durang will be in Los Angeles 
during a week of rehearsals for "Bette and Boo." 
</P>
<P>
David Marshall Grant replaces Durang in the role; Christine Ebersole and Guy 
Boyd play his parents, the title characters. 
</P>
<P>
SEAT-SAVING?: It's a long way from Rolling Hills Estates, home of Albert V. 
Cline, to the corner of Vine and Selma in Hollywood, site of the Doolittle 
Theatre. And just because the Ahmanson Theatre season has moved into the 
Doolittle while the Ahmanson itself is occupied by "The Phantom of the Opera," 
Cline doesn't feel he should have to make the same move. 
</P>
<P>
So Cline, a 20-year Ahmanson subscriber, asked if he could retain his seats at 
the Ahmanson, when the subscription programming returns there after "The 
Phantom" departs, without purchasing seats for the interim season (or seasons) 
at the Doolittle. 
</P>
<P>
Cline attended the first Ahmanson production at the Doolittle, "Hapgood," and 
found the theater "grim, unattractive and in a forbidding area," he wrote in a 
letter to the Ahmanson. He also thought his seats weren't as good as those at 
the Ahmanson. 
</P>
<P>
He balked at spending $820 to renew his four subscriptions (Cline and his wife 
often take guests to the theater), but he wanted the Ahmanson to save his old 
seats for him. The Ahmanson said no. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Schlosser, director of the Ahmanson subscription campaign, defends the 
Doolittle as "infinitely more intimate than the Ahmanson." Regarding Cline's 
complaint about the "Hapgood" seats, Schlosser replied that "we decided not to 
renew (subscribers') seat locations from what they had at 'Hapgood' but to try 
to go back to (Doolittle seats that are comparable to) the Ahmanson locations." 
If Cline drops out now, he said, "we would try hard to accommodate him in 
getting good seats back when he returns." 
</P>
<P>
But "we won't save his seats for him." He said only two or three such requests 
had been received. 
</P>
<P>
Schlosser repeated a suggestion that had already been made to Cline: He could 
renew and then return his Doolittle tickets to the Ahmanson for a tax 
deduction; they could then be resold as single seats. But Cline said he has 
already rejected this idea -- "I'm not going to buy $820 worth of tickets under 
improper pressure."

BATTERED EGGS TAKE ON A NEW NUTRITIONAL IMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
USDA DATA SHOWS A 22% LOWER CHOLESTEROL COUNT THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In May, the U.S. Department of Agriculture updated nutrient composition data 
for raw whole eggs and came up with significant reductions in the cholesterol 
count, thus shedding new light as well as confusion over the use of eggs by 
cholesterol-obsessed Americans. 
</P>
<P>
According to the updated data, the value of cholesterol in eggs is 22% lower, 
dropping from 275 milligrams in 1976 to 213 milligrams in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The new data showing a decrease in cholesterol content is considered a blessing 
for image-battered eggs, which, up to now, have been berated because of their 
high cholesterol content. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Now, Four Eggs a Week Are OK 
</P>
<P>
The new data won the American Heart Assn. stamp of approval on use of as many 
as four eggs per week by healthy American adults, one more egg per week than 
previously recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of new information from the USDA indicating lower cholesterol content 
in egg yolks, the AHA's nutrition committee has indicated that current AHA 
Dietary Guidelines may be satisfied using four egg yolks per week by healthy 
American adults," the AHA says in a policy paper. 
</P>
<P>
The key words, however, are healthy Americans. Those who have severe 
restrictions on cholesterol should follow their doctor's advice on the use of 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
The new American Heart Assn. recommendation increasing servings of eggs from 
three to four per week "does not represent a change in the AHA's dietary 
guidelines," says a heart association policy statement. "The Nutrition 
Committee still recommends a maximum of 300 milligrams of dietary cholesterol 
per day. But new analyses of egg yolks show the average cholesterol content of 
one large egg yolk to be 213 milligrams rather than the previously accepted 274 
milligrams. This allows up to four, rather than three, egg yolks from all 
sources within currently suggested meal plans." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Invisible' Egg Yolks 
</P>
<P>
Consumers are cautioned to compensate for "invisible" egg yolks consumed in 
baked and other prepared foods. "The committee re-emphasized that individuals 
must still strive for a balanced diet, including a variety of foods," the 
statement reads. 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Dietetic Assn., a professional organization of 
registered dietitians, the lower cholesterol count will make it that much 
easier for those who refrained from eating eggs altogether to take another look 
at "nature's perfect food in a package," and for those who restricted intake to 
two or three per week, in accordance with the heart association's 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"Dietitians look upon eggs as a valuable, highly nutrient-dense food, 
particularly for growing children and teen-agers. For the elderly, eggs are an 
excellent source of inexpensive protein," said Rita Storey, spokeswoman for the 
American Dietetic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't mean that it's OK to go hog-wild with eggs," cautioned Storey. 
"Excess intake beyond the recommended amount should be avoided." Consumers 
should also be wary of egg content in processed foods. "At restaurants, instead 
of a three- or four-egg omelet, request one made with only one or two eggs," 
advised Storey. 
</P>
<P>
The new value for cholesterol was a result of a two-part, nationwide sampling 
and nutrient analysis designed by the USDA's Human Nutrition Research Center 
and funded by the Egg Nutrition Center. 
</P>
<P>
"The lower cholesterol values can allow more choice for individuals who wish to 
include eggs in a cholesterol lowering diet," according to Cathy McCharen of 
the Egg Nutrition Center. "We continue to recommend using one egg and two 
whites for serving scrambled, omelets, or other egg dishes. Now you can enjoy 
eggs four times a week, instead of three," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA sampling analysis went like this: Using large eggs from 130 suppliers, 
accounting for more than 60% of the nation's egg production, the 1989 analysis 
produced a new value for cholesterol, 213 milligrams per large, which is 22% 
lower than the value published in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Decrease in Fat Content 
</P>
<P>
According to the USDA update, there was a small decrease in fat content of 
eggs, which was reflected in all three fatty acid classes -- saturated, 
monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, values of seven minerals listed in "Agricultural Handbook No. 8-1 
Composition of Foods" (calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, potassium, niacin and 
ascorbic acid) decreased as well, with iron decreasing the most, meaning that 
along with decrease in cholesterol came a decrease in mineral nutrients as 
well. Of the eight vitamins available in measurable quantities, four had higher 
values and four had lower values. 
</P>
<P>
However, according to Storey, the reduction in minerals does not significantly 
affect the total intake of nutrients in the diet. By adding one or two more 
eggs to the diet each week, one automatically increases lost minerals, said 
Storey. The USDA report also states that changes in nutrient intake can be 
expected to result from changes in the nutrient content of foods. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in the 1985 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals, the 
four-day intake of cholesterol by women age 19 to 50 years was 280 milligrams 
per day. The new cholesterol value for eggs would lower this estimate by about 
9%, assuming that the kind and amount of food eaten remain constant. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, 42% of women's cholesterol intake was provided by eggs, including both 
eggs eaten separately and those eaten as part of mixtures, such as custard. The 
new value would reduce this estimate to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a recipe using eggs and egg whites for making scrambled eggs that can 
be dressed up with herbs and spices for variety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SCRAMBLED EGGS WITHOUT ADDED FAT 
</P>
<P>
1 egg 
</P>
<P>
2 egg whites 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg and egg whites. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring chicken 
broth to boil. Reduce heat to medium and add egg mixture. Cook, scrambling 
until firm as desired and liquid is absorbed. Makes 1 serving. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Any desired herbs, such as chopped, fresh tarragon, mint, basil, or mixed 
herbs may be added to beaten egg mixture before cooking for variety.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: NEW LOOK IN FOOD PREPARATION 'SERVANTS'

Power in the kitchen? It comes from what we call kitchen servants: time- and 
labor-saving electric appliances. Without these convenient cooking, mixing and 
cleaning helpers, the time spent in the kitchen would seem endless. 
</P>
<P>
What's new in kitchen electrics? There's a continuous stream of products 
flowing in but as far as what's different -- there seems to be nothing at all 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Color is playing a major role. Although black and white are still dominant, 
we're seeing spots of pine or hunter green as well as red in mixers, coffee 
makers and grinders. New products usually have old beginnings, some of them 
revived from plans that failed. And some are sequels to items that continue to 
sell successfully, with revisions. 
</P>

There's the toaster. Once a crude wrought iron gadget before it became 
electric, the popular device was played upon in later years to offer more than 
one function. From the early '20s combination toasters started to evolve. 
Armstrong Products, for example, unveiled a toaster and percolator combination; 
Sunbeam had a toaster and table grill combo; Acme Electric produced one with a 
corn popper. In the '30s, Merrit-Made introduced a toaster/coffee-maker model. 
The longest-lasting appeal, and still going strong today, came from GE's 
toaster-oven 1956. 
</P>
<P>
All these plus one toaster model that became a broiler when turned upside down 
could have inspired the new Flip-Over Plus Mini Oven ($89.99) from Tefal 
Appliance Co. of Fairfield, N.J. Compact in design with simple controls, it has 
clean white styling with a striped gray-black trim. 
</P>
<P>
In its upright position, the appliance is a wide-mouth toaster with 
self-centering gates for thick and thin bread slices. It'll also hold bagels, 
muffins, waffles, turnovers and pop-up tarts. Turn it 90 degrees and the unit 
becomes an oven that will bake, broil and defrost. Equipped with a non-stick 
baking tray with a handle, it can cook or grill small dishes such as boneless 
chicken nuggets, lasagna, stews, pork rolls and steak on the bottom position. 
When raised to the upper level, the tray may be used for top browning, thawing, 
baking pizzas, grilled cheese sandwiches and heating dinner entrees (if package 
instructions permit cooking in a toaster oven). 
</P>
<P>
Many popcorn enthusiasts have switched to the electric hot air poppers from the 
pot-on-the range method for some valid reasons. First of all, the power poppers 
cook without oil and don't pose problems with scorching; secondly, the popcorn 
produced is fluffier and thirdly, cooking and clean up are easier. For the avid 
popcorn fan, however, nothing beats the taste and texture of oil-popped corn. 
</P>
<P>
One big complaint with popcorn popped in hot-air poppers is that popped kernels 
are too dry. Producing a moister but fluffier batch of popcorn is Black &amp; 
Decker's Handy Pop 'N Serve Corn Popper ($29.98). Compact in size, the hot-air 
popper looks like a small white blender with clear dishwasher-safe plastic jar. 
It's easy to use with a single on and off control. The lid can be used as a 
kernel measuring cup, and as a tray for the bowl to protect tabletops from heat 
damage as well as a butter-melting cup. 
</P>
<P>
Since caveman times, the most basic implement for food preparation, fishing and 
hunting has been the knife. Although the electric knife has been a great helper 
for slicing a turkey or roast, most cooks still utilize a good knife. The 
important thing is to have a razor-sharp knife. But not many cooks know how to 
sharpen a knife. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Daniel Friel, a retired engineer from DuPont whose pet peeve was dull 
knives, introduced the first compact, electric diamond-hone knife sharpener 
exclusively for home use. It eliminates guesswork with its magnetic guides that 
controls sharpening angles. Overwhelmed by the response of his testers (chefs 
and professionals in the cooking field), Friel called his invention the Chef's 
Choice knife sharpener (Professional Model 100: $80). 
</P>
<P>
After that product success, Edgecraft Corp. (Friel's company) moved on to 
create improved versions. Listening to comments about having too many 
sharpening and honing stages in his first model, which had three stages, Friel 
came up with a variation, Chef's Choice Model 300 ($49.95). More compact, it 
involves a two-stage process. The first stage sharpens the blade at a 45-degree 
angle while the second stage hones at a 50-degree angle for a razor-sharp edge. 
</P>
<P>
The latest model from Edgecraft goes beyond the razor-sharp edge. Called the 
Chef Choice Professional Model 110 ($79.95), its three-stage sharpener is 
geared for sharpening a much wider variety of knives all the way to the handle. 
It can sharpen all lengths of kitchen knives (including short paring knives), 
pocket knives, fillet knives and most hunting knives. In addition to the 
original white color, the unit is available in red or black. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tefal Toaster Plus Mini-Oven is available at Bullock's. Black &amp; Decker 
Handy Pop 'N Serve Corn Popper is available at Adray's and soon at Broadway and 
Home Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef's Choice sharpeners are available at Robinson's, Broadway, Bullock's and 
most specialty cookware shops.

WINE NOTES: WILL THIS 'BLUSH' MAKE WINE MAKERS SEE RED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A Michigan winery has released a wine called Whitezin that has only 10% 
Zinfandel in it. 
</P>
<P>
O'Keefe Cellars, a second label of Chateau Grand Travers in Traverse City, 
Mich., produces a "blush" wine composed of 80% French Colombard, 10% Muscat 
Canelli and 10% Zinfandel. The wine is nonvintage and is made entirely from 
California grapes. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 cases of O'Keefe Whitezin were produced, according to Ed O'Keefe, 
owner of the winery. He said the wine was introduced a few weeks ago with a 
retail price of $3.99 and it is available only in Michigan with a tiny quantity 
available in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
O'Keefe, a former federal narcotics agent, said he has trademarked the term 
Whitezin, which he called a fanciful name. He said he's not trying to put 
anything over on anyone because the percentages of grapes are listed on the 
label. 
</P>
<P>
O'Keefe said he would have made a traditional White Zinfandel if he could, but 
"the quality of the Zinfandel grapes we were getting from New Mexico wasn't 
very good, and I figured I could make a better blush wine by blending in other 
grapes." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Trinchero, president of Sutter Home Winery in the Napa Valley, the world's 
largest producer of White Zinfandel wine, was surprised when told of the 
Michigan wine. 
</P>
<P>
"Some years ago, we tried to use the term Whitezinfandel as one word and the 
BATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) said no," Trinchero said. "They 
wanted us to use a hyphen between the white and the Zinfandel." 
</P>
<P>
Trinchero said he would check with BATF to see if Whitezin is a legal 
proprietary name. 
</P>
<P>
Paribas Domaines USA, the U.S. subsidiary of a French banking group that 
already owns three Bordeaux properties, has acquired the William Wheeler Winery 
in northern Sonoma County in a deal industry sources said was worth about $4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction, completed earlier this month, won't change operation of the 
winery, said Bill Wheeler, who founded the winery with his wife, Ingrid, in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler was named president and chief executive officer of Paribas Domaine USA 
Inc. The Wheelers continue to hold a minority interest in the winery. 
</P>
<P>
The deal transferred the winery, brand, inventory, 30 acres of vineyards and 
100 additional acres of unplanted land to Paribas' parent company, Compagnie 
Financiere de Paribas. The firm also owns Chateau Rayne Vigneau in Sauternes 
and the red Bordeaux properties Chateau La Lagune and Chateau Grand Puy Ducasse 
in addition to Ayala Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler, who earned a post-graduate degree in economics and an MBA at Columbia 
University in New York City, acquired the Dry Creek Valley property in 1970. 
Today William Wheeler Winery markets 20,000 cases of wine. 
</P>
<P>
California's new health warning sign mandated for restaurants has begun 
appearing in eateries. It says, "Warning: Chemicals known to the state of 
California to cause cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm may be 
present in foods or beverages sold or served here." 
</P>
<P>
The Waterfront, a seafood restaurant in San Francisco, was one of the first to 
put up the sign, but appended at the bottom of one of the signs is an addendum 
that reads, "The management therefore discourages all reproductive behavior 
while eating or drinking on these premises." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Grace now is convinced that his wines travel well, and he tells a story to 
prove the point. 
</P>
<P>
Grace, owner of a Napa Valley winery that makes a tiny amount of Cabernet 
Sauvignon, had donated a collection of engraved bottles of his wine for the 
Napa Valley Wine Auction, where the collection sold for $42,000. 
</P>
<P>
An identical lot of wine was set aside for the Sun Valley Wine Auction and was 
in the back seat of Grace's car a few weeks ago when he stopped his car at an 
Oakland barbecue stand to pick up some ribs for that evening's dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Afraid that the wine might overheat, Grace left the engine and the 
air-conditioning running while he picked up the ribs. Seconds later, someone 
had driven off with the unprotected car. 
</P>
<P>
Grace gave chase in a pickup truck of a passer-by, and he used the truck's 
cellular phone to tell Oakland police the route of the fleeing car. But after a 
chase through Oakland city streets, Grace's car disappeared, so he went back to 
the police station to fill out a report. There, he learned his car was fine and 
the culprit was in custody. 
</P>
<P>
The car, speeding down a Vallejo street at 70 miles an hour, was spotted by 
Vallejo plainclothesmen, who gave chase. The driver of the stolen car panicked, 
spun the car out and the engine died. One officer then leaped through the open 
sunroof and on top of the driver. 
</P>
<P>
"The car was insured, so I knew I could get another one of those, but at that 
point, the only thing I cared about was the wine," said Grace. "I couldn't 
replace that." 
</P>
<P>
The wine was undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
The 13th national conference of the Society of Wine Educators is scheduled for 
Aug. 4 to 6 at the Sheraton Long Beach Hotel. Daily sessions are open to the 
public for a fee of $120, which includes lunch, dinner and seminars. 
</P>
<P>
Among the speakers scheduled for the conference are Dr. Paul Saltman of the 
University of California at San Diego, Peter M.F. Sichel of H. Sichel &amp; 
Sohne, and a host of wine makers from various regions of California. 
</P>

HINTS FROM HELOISE: HISTORIC MONTH FOR FRANKFURTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR READERS: Did you know July is National Hot Dog Month? It is sponsored by 
the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council. During the peak summer months 
Americans eat more than 5 billion frankfurters. 
</P>
<P>
The frankfurter is generally believed to have been created by a butcher in 
Frankfurt, Germany, in 1652. 
</P>
<P>
In 1904, at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, an inventive 
concessionaire gave birth to the idea of the frankfurter sandwich as we know it 
today. He was doing a booming business selling the frankfurters as plain 
sausages. So his customers could eat the hot, moist frankfurters, he loaned 
them white gloves. When he closed shop, most of the gloves were not returned. 
He talked to a baker, who designed the bun to protect the fingers, and that's 
how the frankfurter sandwich began. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: We have an awful time removing ice cubes from trays because of so 
many minerals in our water. The ice sticks and shatters into tiny pieces. Can 
you help? 
</P>
<P>
 -- PATRICIA, San Gabriel, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR PATRICIA: It's as easy as using a non-stick vegetable spray that is 
normally used to coat pans for baking or for low-calorie "frying." 
</P>
<P>
Spray the trays before filling them. The ice will pop right out and the cubes 
will be all in one piece. So simple to do, yet so effective. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I thought I would send you this recycling hint. With a family of 
five children, I've been doing this for years. I cut out the fronts and the 
backs of empty cereal boxes. Then I cut each panel into three sections. 
</P>
<P>
I find that these are nice for notes, grocery lists or simply a writing pad for 
telephone messages. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ELLA, Shediac, New Brunswick, Canada 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I was given a beautiful old glass decanter that belonged to my 
grandmother. There are some stains in it that I don't know how to remove. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to use anything that can damage it. Do you know what I should use 
to clean it? 
</P>
<P>
 -- SARAH, Roanoke, Va. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SARAH: I have been told by some antiques dealers that sometimes stains 
cannot be removed from old glass. What works best for them is to mix about 
one-quarter cup dishwasher detergent compound with hot water. When the water 
cools, fill the decanter to the top. Let it soak for a few hours or overnight. 
Use a bottle brush to try and remove stubborn stains. 
</P>
<P>
Some stains may remain. Rinse well and let dry. Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I misplaced my dustpan and, of course, needed one quickly. I 
improvised by using a plastic foam tray that had been in a package of meat. I 
cut the ridge off one long side to make a flat bottom but left the other sides 
to give me something to hold onto and to catch the stuff I was sweeping up. I 
just threw away the whole mess. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARGARET, Seattle, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: This may sound like a silly question but it is the cause of an 
argument in my household. When wrapping an item in aluminum foil for the 
freezer, does the food go on the shiny side or does the shiny side remain on 
the outside? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER, Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READER: We called a leading aluminum foil manufacturer to find out the 
correct response, and guess what? It really doesn't matter which side is out. 
</P>
<P>
Usually the shiny side out looks better, but the food will taste the same 
either way. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer said that when the foil is made, it is rolled and one side of 
the foil gets shiny because it comes in contact with the heavy roller while the 
other side doesn't, which makes that side duller. This should settle this 
issue, and best of all no one was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I cut out recipes from magazines and copy others from books. I 
recently rewrote all of them on colored index cards. I used the different 
colored cards for each food category: green cards for vegetables, white for 
meat and blue for desserts. 
</P>
<P>
This sure makes finding recipes much easier and it makes me feel like I'm more 
organized. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LISA, Salt Lake City, Utah 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I found mid-afternoon a great challenge to my diet because I 
would be hungry and ready to eat anything and everything. 
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, I cut up some carrots and cucumbers and place them in a 
bowl. I add a few ice cubes to keep them cool and crisp and when I have a snack 
attack I nibble on these nutritious snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- RUBY, Flushing, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: The plastic bottoms on one- and two-liter soda bottles can be 
recycled into several different and useful things. After removing them from the 
bottles, I have used them for flower pots and knickknack bowls, and when lined 
with foil, they make great outside ashtrays. 
</P>
<P>
 -- WILLIAM, Washington 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio,

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: SUMMER FRUITS ADD COLOR, TASTE AND VITAMINS TO VARIETY 
OF RECIPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the summer's most prolific fruits, typically eaten out of hand or used 
to flavor and color recipes, also are superb sources of vitamins. This 
nutritional benefit makes them a wise choice to boost vitamin and mineral 
intake without having to resort to commercial vitamin supplements. 
</P>
<P>
Apricots, peaches, cantaloupes and nectarines are packed with Vitamin A, 
Vitamin C, potassium, iron and fiber, while strawberries and oranges supply 
substantial amounts of Vitamin C. Honeydew and watermelon are noted primarily 
for their potassium content, which is modest: about 559 milligrams per 4x8-inch 
wedge of watermelon and 825 milligrams for a 1/10 slice of a five-pound 
honeydew. 
</P>
<P>
On their own, cherries and plums have a marginal value too -- 10 cherries or 
one plum provides only a fraction of the RDA for any vitamin or mineral. But 
combine them with other summer fruits or wholesome ingredients, such as Vitamin 
C-rich red peppers or high-iron spinach, and they make delicious summer salads. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some nutritional values from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Home 
and Garden Bulletin No. 72, "Nutritive Value of Foods," which may be helpful 
for those seeking to improve their vitamin intake without supplementation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One half cantaloupe provides about 1,000 international units (IU) more than 
the Recommended Dietary Allowance for Vitamin A and satisfies the RDA for 
ascorbic acid at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One whole medium nectarine supplies about one-quarter of the day's 
requirement for Vitamin A. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The entire day's need for Vitamin C can be met with just one cup of whole 
strawberries or one whole orange. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three raw apricots provide more than half the RDA for Vitamin A. 
</P>
<P>

THE BUTCHER: ALL-AMERICAN FRANKFURTER CLEANS UP ITS IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must not let July go by without paying tribute to the meat of the month -- 
the all-American frankfurter. 
</P>
<P>
No meat in America is more criticized for a supposed lack of quality and for 
"all that awful stuff they put in them" than the frankfurter. 
</P>
<P>
Let's examine what goes into frankfurters today -- they're really not so awful; 
they are, in fact, pretty wholesome. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations for sausage in the 
frankfurter-bologna category are quite specific and apply to any and all 
products labeled with the terms frankfurter, franks, wieners, Vienna, bologna 
or knockwurst. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Water Factor 
</P>
<P>
They may contain up to 10% added water in the finished product. Water is added 
for several reasons: first, since the meats are run through grinders and 
choppers with high speed blades, there is heat generated within the mixture 
being processed. Water in the form of shaved ice is added to keep the meat at 
the proper temperature during processing. Small amounts of water also are used 
to dissolve curing ingredients and facilitate the even distribution of spices. 
By chemical analysis, even lean T-bone is about 70% water, so don't think 
you're being cheated when you see water listed as an ingredient on a 
frankfurter label. 
</P>
<P>
Oh yes, there is fat in frankfurters too. But not the huge amounts some of the 
critics of the frankfurter would have you believe. By USDA standards, the total 
fat content of a frankfurter may not exceed 30%. That's the same maximum fat 
content that applies to hamburgers; however, most hamburger is made in retail 
meat markets that do not fall under USDA inspection. 
</P>
<P>
All frankfurters are made in USDA-inspected meat plants. If you're concerned 
with fat content, you're more apt to find an excess in hamburger than in 
frankfurters. Even a choice chuck roast very probably has more than 30% fat. 
</P>
<P>
The meat used in making frankfurters is just what the name implies: meat. Back 
in grandmother's day that may have included lips, snouts and ears -- but not 
today. Meat used in the formulation of frankfurters is limited to "skeletal 
meat," the edible part of the animal that is muscle tissue attached to the 
bone. If a frankfurter contains any other than skeletal meat, it must be 
labeled "with byproducts" or "with variety meats." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believe the Label 
</P>
<P>
The traditional frankfurter called for both beef and pork. The recommended 
proportions were usually two parts lean beef to one part of fat pork. These 
days you can find frankfurters that are made of beef only or turkey only or 
even chicken only as well as combinations of beef, pork and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever they are made of, the ingredients are listed on the label. If 
extenders such as cereal or soy flour are added, that will be on the label too, 
and by law such extenders or binders cannot exceed 3.5% of the finished 
product. 
</P>
<P>
As for additives, today's frankfurter has considerably less than the 
frankfurter of old. The nitrite levels in frankfurters have been reduced 
voluntarily by the industry to considerably less than used years ago. Fifty 
years ago it usually was one-quarter ounce of nitrite per 100 pounds of meat, 
three ounces of nitrate per 100 pounds of meat or a combination of the two. 
Today the industry standard is 100 parts per million nitrite. (Nitrate is not 
used at all any more.) 
</P>
<P>
There are a few companies around the country that are making frankfurters 
without nitrites, but be sure to follow the storage instructions to the letter. 
In addition to providing the frankfurter with its characteristic color and 
flavor, sodium nitrite also inhibits the development of botulinus. There is no 
confirmed evidence that anybody has ever become sick from the sodium nitrite 
contained in a frankfurter, but botulism is deadly.

FORMER OJAI CIVIC LEADERS RUNNING 2 LEGAL BROTHELS IN DUSTY DESERT TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BATTLE MOUNTAIN, Nev. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Behind the bar at the Calico Club, one of two brothels in this forlorn desert 
mining town, is a studio portrait of a smiling and naked Ginger Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
She was once a volunteer grade-school librarian in Ojai, and her husband, Chuck 
Barrett, was president of the Ojai Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
They were Ojai orange farmers and civic leaders then. But now they own the 
Calico Club and another ramshackle wood-front brothel just down the road named 
the Desert Club. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the trade is from the truckers who pass this way on one of the more 
desolate stretches of U.S. 80 in northern Nevada. But there has been a small 
boom in the local gold mining business lately, and the clubs cater to the 
miners too. 
</P>
<P>
The two clubs are small but functional, with about 10 prostitutes combined. 
There is a bar in the front of each for small talk and rooms in the back for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low-Key Atmosphere 
</P>
<P>
The women who work here have names like Pepper and Jett and Angel, and the 
atmosphere is low-key as they wander the room in negligees and jeans. There is 
a jukebox at the Calico Club and even a candy machine if you happen to have a 
yen for some M &amp; Ms. 
</P>
<P>
But this is, after all, the whorehouse business. And there is ample evidence of 
that, including a sign on one wall at the Calico Club that reads, "Sticks and 
stones may break my bones, but whips and chains excite me." 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Barrett calls herself the madam of the two places, but the prostitutes 
who work here sometimes refer to Chuck Barrett as Mr. Madam. 
</P>
<P>
Their flight from the orange groves of Ojai to the brothel barrens of Nevada 
came as a shock to a few who knew about it three years ago when the Barretts 
made their move. 
</P>
<P>
It is just as much of a shock today to some of Ojai's leaders. They recall when 
Chuck Barrett's father, R. E. Barrett, was a county supervisor, and the Barrett 
family was generally viewed as a quietly respectable clan. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody is a little bit flabbergasted," said Anson S. Thatcher, 84, 
one of the patriarchs of Ojai's prestigious Thatcher School, where Chuck, 47, 
and Ginger Barrett, 46, sent their son and daughter to prep school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really quite surprising," Thatcher added. "You have to admit it's an 
unusual thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Practicing Lawyer 
</P>
<P>
Not only was Chuck Barrett president of the Ojai Chamber of Commerce for two 
years in the late 1960s, he was a practicing lawyer as well as a citrus grower, 
a member of the Ojai Planning Commission, a director of the San Antonio Water 
Conservation Board and the first president of the Ojai West Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Barrett was the volunteer librarian at Ojai Elementary School for three 
years, helped start a Youth Employment Service at the Ojai Chamber of Commerce, 
served on the Ojai City Parks 
</P>
<P>
and Recreation Commission and was a volunteer tour guide at the Ventura County 
Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"We were definitely viewed as the straightest of the straight and the squarest 
of the square," Ginger Barrett said. "It's hard to remember how the straight 
world views us now. We are a little bit out of the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
But if some of the people back in Ojai take a dim view of their current 
activities, the Barretts make it clear they really don't care too much. 
</P>
<P>
They had already raised their two children, and they were bored with their 
lives as farmers. According to Ginger Barrett, they found Ojai to be a "stuffy 
town" at times and some of the people in Ojai a little pretentious. 
</P>
<P>
"Ojai, we felt, had a tendency to look down on the other communities in the 
county, and some of the people thought they were better than everybody else," 
Ginger Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Compelling Reasons 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Barrett, who married his wife in 1963, had brought her back with him from 
college to the family farm. But after the death of his father in 1977 and his 
mother in 1985, there were no compelling family business reasons to remain. 
</P>
<P>
"A year after mother died we were gone," Chuck Barrett said. "Basically, it was 
a realization that if we were ever going to leave, it would have to be then." 
</P>
<P>
And then came the day in early 1986 when the Barretts, already thinking of a 
move to Arizona and more conventional investments, read in a local newspaper 
that the owners of Battle Mountain's two brothels wanted to sell out. 
</P>
<P>
The Barretts had already sold their 32 acres of oranges and Christmas trees and 
the 60-year-old Spanish-style ranch house that had been their home for years. 
Chuck Barrett says the Ojai estate sold "in the million range," and the brothel 
investments were roughly half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for investments in real estate and I said, 'Here's one,' " Chuck 
Barrett recalled. "We called up and made an appointment to see the books in 
April, 1986." 
</P>
<P>
After their first visit to Battle Mountain, a town of about 5,000 people, the 
Barretts remained interested. But they decided they probably did not have the 
skills to run a couple of brothels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Research 
</P>
<P>
One factor that changed their minds, Ginger Barrett said, was a subsequent trip 
during which she worked at the Calico Club to get a better understanding of the 
business. She will not divulge details of her personal research, but it was a 
crucial part of the move. By August, 1986, the Barretts had decided they could 
make it in the brothel business after all. 
</P>
<P>
While showing some reluctance to explain every consideration that went into the 
decision, Ginger Barrett provided some hints during a recent trip from Battle 
Mountain to the town of Winnemucca to pick up a venereal disease clearance 
certificate for one of her newest employees. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has to do with our general attitudes toward sex," she said. "I 
don't care to go into detail, but I think we have always been more open-minded 
on the subject than some people." 
</P>
<P>
The Barretts pointed out that prostitution is legal in most of the counties of 
Nevada at about 40 brothels similar to the two they run. They defended their 
brothels as sanctuaries for women who might otherwise have to work illegally on 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
One night, while at dinner at the town's main local casino, the Owl Club, on 
what the locals consider the fancier side of Battle Mountain's railroad tracks, 
Chuck Barrett jokingly said he prefers being a pimp to being a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, however, his legal training at Ventura College of Law 
returned. He said he has never really regarded himself as a pimp, especially 
since being a pimp is against the law in Nevada. What he really is, Barrett 
said, is sort of a hotel keeper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal View 
</P>
<P>
In his considered legal view, Barrett said, a pimp in Nevada is someone who 
encourages a woman to enter prostitution, not somebody who makes a living off 
the money she earns. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Chuck Barrett said, he views his new career as both fun and 
challenging. Ginger Barrett said that running the brothels of Battle Mountain 
has been a wondrous experience. 
</P>
<P>
"There's hardly any other job for women that pays as much," she said. "It is a 
good career for a woman." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Thursday night, the highlight of the evening at the Calico Club -- 
at least around the front bar area -- was a visit from Lander County Sheriff 
Steve Bishop, a regular bar customer at the two clubs as well as the man 
responsible for making sure that all the activities there stay within legal 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
As the sheriff and a former district attorney traded rounds of drinks and 
chatted with the Barretts, a pair of truck drivers entered the Calico, their 
diesel rigs parked just outside. Jett and Angel did their best to entice the 
potential customers into the back, but the men just wanted to drink. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comfortable at the Bar 
</P>
<P>
At times, that can be a problem in the brothel business, Ginger Barrett said. 
She has tried to maintain a friendly atmosphere in the front rooms, and 
sometimes the men get so comfortable at the bar that they decide against 
forking over the $70 or so it usually takes for sexual activity in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Even among their own employees the Barretts have raised some eyebrows with 
their approach to business. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Crosthwaite, the grandmotherly bartender and manager of the Calico Club, 
said she quit for four months when they took over because she thought Ginger 
Barrett was loosening things up too much. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids who work here were never allowed to drink on the job before, but 
Ginger changed that," Crosthwaite said. "I still think it's a mistake. But I'm 
not the boss. Ginger may be new to this, but that hasn't slowed her down." 
</P>
<P>
There are six rooms in the Calico Club and five at the Desert Club, although 
Chuck Barrett is busily adding a sixth room there as fast as possible. Not only 
do the women service their customers in the tiny rooms, they live there during 
their stints in Battle Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them come from Reno and Lake Tahoe, and most of them stay four months 
or so before moving somewhere else. Chuck Barrett said some of the women get 
married to truck drivers, but usually they have other reasons for leaving, 
ranging from wanderlust to advanced alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing fancy about either of the two brothels. Battle Mountain isn't 
New Orleans. But there is a mobile home in the back that functions as the VIP 
room for the occasional high roller who wanders in and is willing to pay $300 
to $400 for an entire evening with the woman of his choice and a large supply 
of pornographic movies. 
</P>
<P>
Next door to the VIP trailer is another mobile home where the Barretts live. It 
is considerably smaller than the 5,000-square-foot home they abandoned when 
they moved from Ojai. There are three other mobile homes that are part of the 
Barrett empire here, one housing a bookstore, another a T-shirt printing 
operation and another serving as a dress shop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mobile Home Mini-Mall 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the place looks like a sort of mobile home mini-mall. You can buy 
everything from Jett and Angel to volumes of Shakespeare and the latest Reno 
fashions. Right now there is a new construction project on the complex, a 
permanent office site that will house the newspaper they just purchased. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, there was not much controversy about the Barretts' move to Battle 
Mountain either there or back in Ojai when they originally bought the brothels. 
Only when they recently purchased a newspaper called the Battle Mountain Bugle 
did a furor erupt among Nevada's other newspaper publishers over whether 
brothel owners ought to be permitted in the Fourth Estate. 
</P>
<P>
While Chuck Barrett says he has so far avoided even joining the Battle Mountain 
Chamber of Commerce, he explained his decision to buy the county's only 
newspaper as one that was inspired partly by the same sort of civic-mindedness 
that marked his earlier life in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
The previous newspaper owner wanted to sell out, and Barrett said he wanted to 
give Battle Mountain the kind of quality paper it needs. Barrett sees the 
purchase as a chance to add to his growing portfolio of companies and to help 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
"This community deserves a quality paper, and that's what we are committed to 
giving them," Barrett said. He denied that his new role as the county's only 
publisher could benefit his brothel business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really motivated by money," he said. "It's the pleasure of starting 
something. Creativity. I really want to help Battle Mountain. It's a 
fascinating little town. It certainly would never lend itself to being thought 
of as picturesque. But I like the honesty here. We're not hypocrites." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Writing a History 
</P>
<P>
But as much as the Barretts like Battle Mountain today, they do not know if 
they have found their final home yet, they said. Chuck Barrett is thinking of 
writing a history about his two brothels, focusing on the 1931 murder of one of 
the former madams, Doris Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about the future," he said. "Right now there's an intensity to 
what we are doing. We have some further plans, mainly the addition of a 
mail-order business for our T-shirt operation. I'm the sort of person who gets 
very easily bored, but so far I haven't had time for that here." 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Barrett said she is having the time of her life in Battle Mountain. She 
views the prostitutes who work for her as an extended family, she said, and has 
come to think of herself as a sort of den mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it. What I love best is being able to provide a safe family atmosphere 
for the women," she said. "One thing I can say about the brothel business, 
however, is that we wouldn't want to stay in it for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get burned out doing this, and you want to be able to get out before 
you reach that point."

STATE FINES LYNWOOD SCHOOLS FOR OVERCROWDING

<TEXT>
<P>
The Lynwood Unified School District has been fined $360,000 by the State Board 
of Education for placing students in overcrowded classrooms rather than hiring 
additional teachers or substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
State education officials said the district was fined for constantly violating 
the state's average limit of 30 students per classroom during the 1988-89 
school year. All of the violations occurred in the elementary grades. 
</P>
<P>
The district was criticized particularly for moving students to other 
classrooms when teachers were absent. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, students from different grades were placed in the same 
classrooms when teachers were absent, said Wade Brynelson, a state education 
official. "Third-graders were being placed with sixth-graders, and so forth," 
said Brynelson, director of the Compliance and Consolidation Programs Division. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph D. Carrabino, a member of the State Board of Education, said in an 
interview that placing younger children in classrooms with older children "is 
immoral. It's a sham. I've never heard of anything that crass. 
</P>
<P>
The district is merely baby-sitting the students, rather than educating them, 
said Carrabino, a professor at UCLA's Graduate School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
District officials had argued at a board subcommittee hearing last week in 
Sacramento that they had taken a number of steps to address the overcrowding, 
including hiring new teachers, renting trailers and raising the pay for 
substitute teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked them to waive the penalty but were turned down," said Richard 
Armstrong, president of the Lynwood school board. "They thought what we were 
doing was a barbaric practice. 
</P>
<P>
"We are bursting at the seams. But we have done things to improve the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Other state education officials said, however, that the district did not make 
timely efforts to hire substitute teachers or rent trailers. 
</P>
<P>
"The (educational) needs of students were not adequately addressed," said Leroy 
Hamm, a state education consultant. "The kids were not getting a good 
education. Teachers were not happy. Parents were not happy." 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Perkins, a veteran elementary teacher who is president-elect of the 
Lynwood Teachers Assn., said this week that "mixing students together has 
always been a problem in the district." 
</P>
<P>
Perkins, a third-grade teacher, said on one occasion in the last school year 
there were 57 students in her classroom -- 30 of her students and 27 first and 
third graders from classes of absent teachers. Perkins said that sixth graders 
also have been sent to her third-grade class at times. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers receive extra pay when they take on additional students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
State education officials said the fine was based on a formula showing that the 
equivalent of 131 students attended classes over the 30-student limit in first 
through third grades in the last school year. The number of students was 
multiplied by $2,749 -- the amount of state money earmarked for each of the 
district's 14,000 students -- to determine the fine. 
</P>
<P>
The district will dip into its reserve fund, which totals about $4.8 million, 
to pay the penalty, a Lynwood administrator said. 
</P>
<P>
"They said we would not be adversely affected. They did not give us an 
opportunity to reply," said Clifford Koch, assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to handle its excessive enrollment, the district placed 10 
trailers as portable classrooms at elementary school sites and hired about 20 
new teachers, Koch said. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the district had trouble hiring substitute teachers 
because surrounding districts offered more pay. But the Lynwood school board 
recently raised substitute pay from $80 to $90 a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Hardship 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), whose district covers Lynwood, 
questioned the fine against the low-income, mostly Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly being fined will present an additional hardship in terms of having 
the dollars that you need to manage and run a school district," she said in an 
interview. "So, I don't like fines to say: 'I want to make you better,' when in 
fact it hurts you." 
</P>
<P>
Waters said her office is seeking to determine the accuracy of state 
allegations about the transfer of students during teacher absences, and the 
lack of substitute teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Koch, the assistant superintendent, said the district, which has an enrollment 
growth of about 4% a year, has reached its capacity and has no land for 
expansion. The district has been attempting to build a new high school for more 
than five years, but is currently in court with the owners of the land. 
</P>
<P>
Koch said the district is renovating and expanding eight of its nine elementary 
schools, which are more than 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the schools were built to accommodate 500 to 600 students, but 
enrollment in some of the buildings now is more than double that capacity, Koch 
said. For example, a total of 1,400 students attend Lindbergh Elementary School 
and 1,300 students are enrolled at Roosevelt, he said.

BILL ON CENTRAL CREDIT CHECKS FOR UTILITIES STALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bill by Assemblyman Willard H. Murray (D-Paramount) to let gas and electric 
utilities join a centralized credit bureau to track down delinquent customers 
stalled this week after Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) assailed the 
proposal as "a major invasion of individual privacy." 
</P>
<P>
In response to Garamendi's objections, the Senate Energy and Public Utilities 
Committee on Monday delayed action on the measure until the Legislature returns 
to the Capitol after its four-week summer recess, which begins on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's bill has two key provisions. One is designed to ensure that a decision 
by a public utility to require a security deposit is based only upon the credit 
history of the customer and not a relative or roommate. 
</P>
<P>
The second part -- which prompted criticism from Garamendi -- would require the 
California Public Utilities Commission to authorize gas and electric utilities 
to participate in a centralized credit check system established in 1985 for the 
state's seven largest telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of Murray's proposal -- according to an analysis of the bill by the 
Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee -- is to help utilities locate 
customers who failed to pay bills and moved to another part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Ross, a lobbyist for Southern California Edison Co., said his utility 
already shares credit information with other electric utilities -- a program 
that last year resulted in Edison collecting $665,000 in unpaid bills. He said 
Murray's measure, which Edison supports, would allow the electric utilities to 
swap similar information with telephone companies and other utilities. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Murray said his original aim was to abolish the 
requirement for utility security deposits, which sometimes pose a hardship, 
especially to poor people. Supporters say that some utilities have sought 
deposits from new residential customers based upon the belief that a previous 
tenant, who failed to pay his bill, may have been a roommate of the new 
customer. 
</P>
<P>
Murray said that as a trade-off to remove opposition from utilities, the bill 
went beyond spelling out conditions for obtaining a security deposit to provide 
utilities "with access to central credit information." 
</P>
<P>
But in an interview Tuesday, Garamendi questioned the value of the trade-off 
because, "on balance the consumers aren't going to be better off." 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's committee hearing, Garamendi criticized the legislation, 
saying: "Mr. Murray, not to pick on you and your bill, but you're doing far 
more than just dealing with security deposits . . . and in my view it is a 
major invasion of individual privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi labeled the bill "a bad one, a real bad one" because "we're really 
going to hurt people . . . ." He also scolded Murray for "really putting Big 
Brother in place in a big, big way, with no consumer protection." 
</P>
<P>
Murray said that he did not face similar criticism when the bill was in the 
Assembly, which approved the measure last month on a 70-1 vote. He brushed 
aside the objections, maintaining that the bill includes consumer protections 
because it prohibits public utilities from releasing, transferring or selling 
credit information or using it for marketing programs. 
</P>
<P>
Murray also said the intent of the bill is not to set up a new credit check 
system, but merely to utilize the system used by telephone companies. 
Currently, phone companies exchange information to determine whether, for 
example, a customer who has skipped out on a bill is seeking telephone service 
somewhere else in the state, according to PUC officials. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, the Edison lobbyist, said that the measure could help utilities lower 
costs if they could more easily locate customers who failed to pay their bills. 
If the legislation becomes law, he said, it would assure that "rate-payers 
don't have to subsidize people not paying bills."

NORWALK FORGOS BALLOT, DRAFTS BAN ON DRINKING IN PARKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has asked for an ordinance outlawing the drinking of beer and 
wine in open areas of the city's 13 parks. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously Tuesday to direct City Atty. Steven L. Dorsey to 
draft the ordinance for consideration at its Aug. 1 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law would allow drinking of beer and wine by permit in park 
buildings for events such as wedding receptions, but it would no longer be 
legal in open park areas. It is already illegal to drink hard liquor in parks, 
said Ernie Garcia, deputy city manager of community services. 
</P>
<P>
The council members and other city officials said they hope the ban will 
drastically reduce incidents of rude behavior caused by drinking, behavior 
which reportedly has driven some families from Norwalk's parks. Residents also 
have complained about broken beer and wine bottles littering the parks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty good-sized problem," said Councilman Mike Mendez, a strong 
supporter of the ban. "There are a lot of people drinking, a lot of under-age 
people drinking." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department officials say they do not keep statistics on 
drinking-related crime in Norwalk parks. But Sgt. John Beaver said fights and 
vandalism are the most common crimes related to drinking in the parks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Banned in Other Cities 
</P>
<P>
Beaver said Southeast-area residents go to Norwalk when they want to drink at 
picnics or other park events. Bellflower, Cerritos, Downey, Lakewood, La 
Mirada, Santa Fe Springs and Whittier, for example, have banned drinking in 
open park areas. Some of those cities allow drinking by permit in park 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony at Tuesday night's meeting was divided on whether there should be a 
ban on drinking in Norwalk parks. Offenders will be subject to citations for 
misdemeanors, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
The council initially considered putting an advisory measure on the November 
ballot to query voters about the ban. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Kenneth Myers urged the council to move forward without the ballot 
measure. He said he was riding his bike with his son in Gerdes Park recently 
when he saw families leave because youths were drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see the parks given back to us," said Myers, who Tuesday night was 
named to the city's Parks and Recreation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
More than 180 residents signed petitions requesting the ban. The Southeast 
Chapter of the United Neighborhoods Organization and the Norwalk-La Mirada 
Council of PTAs also supported the ban. 
</P>
<P>
But nearly 50 residents signed letters requesting the advisory vote. 
</P>
<P>
Isabel Verver, a Norwalk resident who sits on the city's Rental Mediation 
Commission, told the council that social drinking in the parks would pose no 
problem if existing laws against public drunkenness and drinking by minors were 
more strictly enforced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Commander Backs It 
</P>
<P>
"As citizens we have a right to vote," Verver said. 
</P>
<P>
But the council voted to draft the ordinance to impose the drinking ban after 
the proposal received the support of Capt. Ronald Black, commander of the 
sheriff's Norwalk substation. 
</P>
<P>
Black said deputies have arrested minors for drinking in Norwalk parks, but 
that selective enforcement is difficult. It is easier for deputies to enforce a 
total ban rather than have to check whether a drinker may be underage, Black 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"(The ordinance) would allow effective supervision in the parks," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Parks and Recreation Commission recently held two public forums on 
the issue. The commission recommended a total ban of alcoholic beverages, even 
in park buildings. Councilman Robert E. White said he would support a total 
ban, but received no support from his council colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, the deputy city manager of community services, said drinking in park 
buildings does not pose much of a problem because park officials are present, 
permits are required and applicants must furnish security guards for large 
events.

CHARMING STREET LEADS TO A GRITTY FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
ARBOLADA ROAD IS CHALLENGE FOR DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tiny Arbolada Road slips off Los Feliz Boulevard so inconspicuously that few 
stray cars venture onto the one-block lane of pleasant hillside homes. It 
curves charmingly toward a dirt dead end. 
</P>
<P>
That's fortunate because, once lured onto Arbolada, most drivers find it a 
challenge to get away. The street is so narrow that, even with parking 
restricted to one side, there is barely room for a medium-sized car to pass its 
curves, let alone swing a three-point turn. 
</P>
<P>
For years, residents turned in a cul-de-sac that they fashioned for themselves 
in the empty lot at the end of the road. 
</P>
<P>
That their turnaround was on private property caught no one's attention until 
the owner of the land fenced it off about two years ago to begin construction 
of a house. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, once-serene Arbolada has become one of those gritty little urban 
problems that grate on the nerves and generate lots of bureaucratic paper work 
and won't go away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Really Dispirited' 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is just really dispirited," said Priscilla Sanders, a 40-year 
resident of the street. 
</P>
<P>
Large gashes in the corners of the street's garages, which stand directly 
behind the sidewalk, testify to the miscalculations of drivers edging back and 
forth to turn on the 21-foot-wide roadway. 
</P>
<P>
With practice and patience, it can be done. The residents' main concern is 
access to public services. City trash trucks can't turn on the street, so they 
have to back up. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Knute Martin said his fire insurance was canceled by one company for 
lack of access. 
</P>
<P>
Residents worry that the constricted street could delay fire trucks or an 
ambulance in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Their complaints to Los Angeles City Councilman John Ferraro have generated a 
thick file of correspondence but no solution. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw the problem, I thought no big deal, we'll catch it," said 
Ferraro deputy Tom LaBonge. "But it became deeper and deeper." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigation Asked 
</P>
<P>
In November, Ferraro asked the city's superintendent of building to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
A senior inspector for the Bureau of Community Safety wrote back with bad news. 
He said that the Street Widening and Improvement Bureau showed no continuation 
of the road and that the owner of the end lot was not required by law to make 
any improvement for public use. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Ferraro wrote a stiff query to City Engineer Robert S. Horii. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did the city fail to get any dedication for a future street at this 
location?" he asked. "What can be done to remedy this situation?" 
</P>
<P>
Responding in February, Horii threw up his hands. He traced the error to 1927, 
when the tract was recorded. He said the present owner, Paul Krpiean, could not 
be required to dedicate land or make a cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owner Not Obligated 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the residents in the area were previously using private 
property, not their own, to turn around does not obligate that property owner 
to construct a cul-de-sac for them," Horii said. 
</P>
<P>
LaBonge said he spoke to Krpiean, who seemed willing to help solve the problem. 
Sanders, however, said she approached Krpiean on the street and found him 
uncooperative. Krpiean would not comment to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
With or without the landowner's cooperation, a solution would still require 
money to acquire land and pave a turnaround. Horii said the city had no money 
for such a project. 
</P>
<P>
As a temporary measure, Horii suggested prohibiting parking on both sides of 
the street. The suggestion wasn't followed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Prepared 
</P>
<P>
In June, Ferraro asked Horii to prepare a plan for building a turnaround in the 
hope that the project could be put in the city's capital improvement program. 
</P>
<P>
That report is due soon. The money, even if approved by the City Council, would 
be years away. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, life on Arbolada goes its dispirited way. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders said she has been forced to discontinue meetings of her church circle. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the ladies just can't make it," she said. "They just can't negotiate 
this street." 
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact," she added, "I can't have my daughter's wedding here."

PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW RESIDENTIAL INNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale Planning Department has introduced plans to allow 
"bed-and-breakfast" facilities in neighborhoods zoned for apartments and 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The bed-and-breakfast inns would meet the needs of travelers, the homeless and 
owners who can no longer afford to maintain large, old homes, Planning Director 
John McKenna said at Tuesday's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
First, he said, the inns would offer "personable accommodations" to the 
traveling public. "We read in the newspapers that there seems to be a trend 
toward these more homelike accommodations, as opposed to a hotel or a motel." 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, McKenna said, older homes could be preserved thanks to the added 
source of income. 
</P>
<P>
He said that by preserving these homes, the city would be protecting historic 
landmarks and preventing the erection of newer, larger apartments that would 
add to the city's population, which the city is trying to keep from 
skyrocketing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temporarily Homeless 
</P>
<P>
And, McKenna noted, the bed-and-breakfast inns would help the city meet 
recommendations recently added to its General Plan for transitional housing for 
families that become temporarily homeless, and need short- and medium-term 
support to get back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
"The Salvation Army, for example, could use the inns as transitional 
facilities," McKenna said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Greg Roth, head of a coalition of churches and charitable 
organizations that work with the homeless in Glendale, said he was elated about 
McKenna's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"That's great," he said. "I'm glad the city realizes that we need a variety of 
approaches to deal with the homeless problem." 
</P>
<P>
The city allows owners of large homes to rent up to five bedrooms, but it 
restricts occupancy to one person per bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, authored by McKenna, would delete the occupancy restriction to 
allow couples or families with children to occupy a single room in these 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, McKenna said, the inns would have to provide one parking 
space per guest. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to McKenna's presentation, the council voted unanimously to set 
public hearing dates of Aug. 14 before the Planning Commission and Aug. 27 
before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said he prepared the proposal after members of the city's Historic 
Preservation Commission brought to his attention the request by a homeowner on 
Chester Street to open a bed-and-breakfast inn on his property because he needs 
the income. 
</P>
<P>
"The house was not included in the city's Historic Preservation Element, but 
commission members said they thought the house should be preserved. This 
proposal is one way to do that," McKenna said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Carl Raggio said he thought that the project was a good idea. "I 
think it has a lot of positives and not very many minuses. When my kids went to 
Europe, they used these types of inns to save money, and they got to meet a lot 
of people in a friendly environment." 
</P>
<P>
No council member expressed opposition to the proposal.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: A LAST CALL TO UNFURL AS AN ADULT OF CHARACTER AND 
PURPOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 8:45 each morning this week, 21 young men and women wearing white T-shirts 
and blue baseball caps have assembled in a ragged military formation in the 
parking lot behind the state employment office in South Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Larry Forrest, a tall, stern figure in a light green uniform, looked them 
over with restrained disapproval as they answered roll call. 
</P>
<P>
"Cutright!" the drill sergeant barked. 
</P>
<P>
"James C.," a recruit called back. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the boot-camp routine, Cutright wasn't in the Army yet. 
</P>
<P>
He tried but couldn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunland youth twice took the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery -- 
the entrance exam for the military -- and flunked. He was a youth without a 
job, without a basic education and without a future. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's receiving a last call to unfurl as an adult of character and purpose. 
The platoon he mustered with for the first time Monday is actually a class. It 
will meet six hours a day, five days a week for six weeks. Part of its 
instruction will be military. Most will be employment training and the three Rs 
toned by military discipline. 
</P>
<P>
The class mission is to shape unskilled, undisciplined youth into material for 
the military, work or school. 
</P>
<P>
The class is run by the California National Guard under an obscure program 
called IMPACT. It was the brainstorm 12 years ago of then-Gov. Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown Jr. It is still in favor under his ideological opposite, Gov. 
George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he cut millions of dollars in social programs from this year's budget, 
Deukmejian left an appropriation to expand IMPACT from five to seven centers at 
a cost of $1,700 per student. One of those centers went to Glendale, whose 
Chamber of Commerce Military/Veterans Committee had been lobbying for it two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The program will have a permanent home this fall in a rented office on West 
Glenoaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Although the zoning approval is pending, its director, Capt. Milton Myers, got 
the first class off the ground this week in temporary quarters at the 
Employment Development Department on South Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
After roll call on the parking lot among the state office workers' cars, the 16 
men and five women, all ages 17 to 21, filed into a tight little classroom on 
the second floor. Each had a name tag on a desk, beginning with the title 
cadet. 
</P>
<P>
On their second day of class Tuesday, the cadets began with Michael Sims, 
employment marketing specialist with the EDD. Sims had them fill out 
unemployment benefits forms. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know why I'm asking you to do this?" he asked with gentle solicitation. 
"To show you how much the state cares about you. They're willing to pay you to 
learn." 
</P>
<P>
Each student had a paperback dictionary and a stack of general education 
workbooks. The math book begins with 1 plus 1 equals 2, literally, and ends 
with algebra equations and basic geometry concepts such as perimeters, areas 
and volumes. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the back of the class, Myers said many of the youths had officer 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them did not take algebra and geometry in high school. They just 
wanted to go into the military. They didn't know they needed them." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students in the class didn't even complete high school. 
</P>
<P>
When asked how the first day's class affected his expectations of the future, 
Cadet Badolian answered: "It rised. Now I take the class, I can go into my 
future and make plans." 
</P>
<P>
Cadet Fetherolf said friends came to his house the night before and were 
stunned to see him doing homework. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them this is serious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Be honest," Sims exhorted. "Who did not do any homework last night?" 
</P>
<P>
Two hands went up. 
</P>
<P>
"I read, but I fell asleep reading," Cadet Franklin confessed. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a game last night, but no excuses," Cadet Juarez said. 
</P>
<P>
When the applications were completed, Sims turned the students over to Elli 
Ronen, who addressed them with a heavy "Good morning," in an Eastern European 
accent. There was a mumble in response. 
</P>
<P>
Myers broke in. "When he says, 'Good morning,' you're supposed to sound off. 
Let's try it again." 
</P>
<P>
"Good morning, sir!" they said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to shout," Ronen assured them. Then the lesson began with a 
review of division, then fractions. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, we made a review of whole numbers," he began. "Who has a problem 
with fractions?" 
</P>
<P>
Half the class raised hands. He began fractions with an analogy of a broken 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
"The only difference, when you break a whole number, all the pieces are equal," 
Ronen said. They listened. 
</P>
<P>
In six weeks, the students will receive 108 hours of academics from Ronen. They 
will work with Sims 40 hours to learn how to sell themselves to employers. They 
will drill under Forrest 32 hours. 
</P>
<P>
They'll live by rules. On Tuesday, Forrest collected hand-written papers on 
amoeba and Einstein's theory of relativity as penance for infractions. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, they'll have a graduation, then choose their own directions in 
life. Statistics from past classes suggest that 30% will join the armed forces, 
20% will do nothing and the rest will find jobs or return to school. 
</P>
<P>
They'll all know how to say "Good morning, sir."

CONDOR'S FLYOVER IS 'NATURAL INQUISITIVENESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNA GOWENLOCK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recently transplanted Andean condor flew over Ventura last week. A government 
biologist said he hopes that the bird doesn't make a habit of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Exploring is part of its natural inquisitiveness, so we're not really 
surprised by the visit," said biologist James Wiley of the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. "But I would be concerned if it were attracted back." 
</P>
<P>
Wiley said it is too early to tell whether the condor's flight over Grant Park 
started a trend. If it did, officials will have to find ways to keep the birds 
away. 
</P>
<P>
One concern is that the curious birds, with their 8-foot wingspans, may become 
targets for hunters and others, he said. Another is that populated areas simply 
pose more dangers for the birds than the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
The bird is one of six that were released next to the Sespe Condor Sanctuary 
near Fillmore last year in an effort by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the 
Los Angeles and San Diego zoos, and the California Department of Fish and Game 
to study condors in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
Project officials are monitoring the Andean birds in an effort to learn more 
about what may happen when the endangered California condors eventually are 
released into the wild. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to learn where these birds are going to go, what kinds of challenges 
they are going to run into," Wiley said. "That way we can gather information 
that may help us when the California condors are released." 
</P>
<P>
Of the original seven Andean condors, five are still alive. One died as it was 
moved to the release site, and another was killed when it flew into electrical 
lines, Wiley said.

UPTOWN GYM OWNERS PLEAD INNOCENT TO DRUG CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owners of the Uptown Gym in Whittier pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges of 
possessing anabolic steroids and cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Richard C. Gill, 49, and Rick Weaver, 45, had been charged in Whittier 
Municipal Court with one count each of possession of cocaine for sale, 
possession of anabolic steroids for sale and illegal possession of hypodermic 
syringes. Gill's wife, Carol, 45, denied the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
The three, all of whom are bodybuilders, were arrested last month after an 
investigation by Whittier police, who said they found steroids and cocaine at 
the gym. Steroids and cocaine were also found at the Gills' home, and steroids 
and an AK-47 assault rifle were found at Weaver's home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gill and Weaver are free on $5,000 bail; Carol Gill is free on her own 
recognizance. All three defendants will have a preliminary hearing Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
The gym and the Gills' home were seized by federal and local authorities July 
12. Weaver's home was not seized. Federal marshals reopened the gym after the 
seizure and appointed an acting manager.

FAMILY OF SLAIN MAN WINS $150,000 COUNTY SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors has approved a $150,000 settlement for the 
family of a 57-year-old South Gate man who died in 1984 after his skull was 
shattered by blows struck by a sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors approved the settlement without comment for the family of 
William Sisoyev. The county counsel's office had recommended that the 
supervisors approve the settlement rather than go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Sisoyev died of blows to the head suffered in an altercation with Deputy Thomas 
Kirk, who had visited Sisoyev's home concerning an outstanding speeding 
citation. Sisoyev was hit with a sap, a metal night stick covered with leather. 
</P>
<P>
Sisoyev's children, Katherine and George Sisoyev, asked the district attorney's 
office to prosecute the officer on a number of claims, including one that 
Sisoyev's civil rights had been violated. After a six-month investigation, the 
district attorney's office declined to file charges, citing insufficient 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The South Gate City Council also asked the Justice Department to investigate 
the death. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Sisoyev said in an interview that the family found little comfort in 
the settlement. "We said we would settle, but we wanted them to admit they did 
wrong," she said.

DEPUTY POLICE CHIEF CLARK DEMOTED TO COMMANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A deputy police chief who was once a finalist to head the Long Beach Police 
Department was reduced to the rank of commander last week, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles W. Clark, deputy chief of the Executive Operations Bureau heading the 
650-officer department's Internal Affairs, Training and Community Affairs 
divisions, was demoted effective Saturday, Assistant City Manager John Shirey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision "was given a lot of long thought," Shirey said, adding that he 
could not comment further. Police officials also refused to discuss reasons for 
the demotion. Clark, who was at home on sick leave, had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Clark was among three final candidates to head the department two years ago 
when Police Chief Charles Ussery retired. Clark competed against Cmdr. Jerome 
Lance and Lawrence L. Binkley, who at the time was a commander with the Los 
Angeles Police Department. Binkley won the job. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Internal Affairs Division investigates officers for alleged 
wrongdoing, Clark is generally considered popular with many rank-and-file 
officers. "He's straightforward," said Mike White, a board member of the Long 
Beach Police Officers Assn. "He's honest and people respect that." 
</P>
<P>
Clark also personally headed the department's initial investigation into 
assertions of impropriety by a fellow deputy chief, David Dusenbury. Officer 
Jack O'Neil said he was interviewed twice by Clark. Dusenbury was absolved 
after a three-week investigation by a private investigator, who was hired by 
the city manager. Shirey said Clark's demotion was unrelated to any 
investigations of other officers.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE COUNCIL AGAIN DEFERS ZONING CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After about an hour of deliberation, the Glendale City Council on Tuesday 
postponed for the 12th time acting on a zoning ordinance that would reduce the 
size and require more landscaping and amenities at all new apartments and 
condominiums in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Council members have embarked on their third item-by-item review of the draft 
ordinance. Mayor Jerold Milner said the council is being "extra careful in 
making sure we don't leave any loopholes for the developers to beat the 
system." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance was drafted in September by the city's planning staff. 
After a lengthy public hearing process, it was introduced in the council in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
All five council members have said they agree in principle on the ordinance, 
but as of Tuesday they were still instructing the staff to consider making 
minor changes.

COURT UPHOLDS NEW BUS LINE'S RIGHT TO OPERATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG QUINTANA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past year, backers of the fledgling Foothill Transit Zone have 
contended with various legal and political roadblocks, including a trial over 
whether it could even exist. 
</P>
<P>
The hurdles have hampered the agency's plans to take over more than a third of 
the San Gabriel Valley's bus service from the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, Foothill Transit may have eluded its most serious threat when a 
Los Angeles Superior Court judge upheld its right to operate, surmounting a 
challenge by RTD drivers and mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tomorrow," said William P. Forsythe, Foothill Transit executive 
vice president. The decision "is going to allow us to do what we set out to do 
a long time ago -- provide a transit option for people out here instead of 
driving a car." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Eli Chernow on Tuesday upheld Foothill 
Transit's continued operation, which includes its plans to take over up to 20 
of the RTD's 54 lines in the Foothill area by the middle of next year. Foothill 
Transit, a partnership among 20 area cities and the county, contracts with 
private bus companies to provide service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a clear victory for all the people of the San Gabriel Valley," said 
Claremont Councilwoman Judy Wright, who is president of the transit zone and a 
frequent critic of the RTD's San Gabriel Valley service. "I've been working on 
this for 13 years . . . so I feel this is a culmination of that work." 
</P>
<P>
During the monthlong trial that ended in June, union attorneys contended that 
Foothill Transit threatened union jobs at RTD and was an illegal, "privatized" 
competitor. Representatives of the United Transportation Union, which 
represents drivers, and the Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents 
mechanics, charged that Foothill was an attempt to bust the unions. Foothill 
officials deny that. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Chernow said much of the case was political and not under the 
court's jurisdiction. He ruled that Foothill was legally created and that the 
potential harm to the area's bus riders if Foothill were not allowed to take 
over the lines outweighed the possible adverse impact on RTD workers. 
</P>
<P>
Chernow's decision gives the unions 15 days to appeal. Neither union 
representatives nor their attorneys could be reached about whether they will do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
"We will go forward and do whatever we have to do, and if an appeal is part of 
it, then we'll be there," Wright said. "But I'm hoping that the decision is 
strong enough to prevent that." 
</P>
<P>
Foothill's vice president, Robert Bartlett, was more blunt: "When the decision 
comes out so clearly one way or another, appeals tend not to look so bright." 
</P>
<P>
Since December, Foothill has contracted with Embree Bus Lines to operate two 
freeway express routes from Diamond Bar and Glendora to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Transit's base fare is 85 cents, compared to the RTD's base fare of 
$1.10. Forsythe has estimated that ridership has increased up to 20% on the 
lines since Foothill took them over. There now are more than 2,660 riders on 
the Foothill lines each day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill plans to add five local lines in the mid-valley area in August, 
bringing to seven the number of routes taken over from the RTD. 
</P>
<P>
Forsythe said Foothill is negotiating with Cincinnati-based ATE Inc. to operate 
the lines. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill, having ordered 60 new buses, intends to take over two additional 
express lines in late January from the Pomona Valley to Los Angeles.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN THROWS CAUSTIC LIQUID IN FACE OF GLENDALE 
WOMAN, 22 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale woman is being treated for severe chemical burns after an 
unidentified man accosted her on the street Sunday and threw a caustic liquid 
in her face, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Shusan Eloyan, 22, was walking in the 100 block of North Adams Street in 
Glendale about 4:40 p.m. when the man approached her from behind and threw the 
liquid in her face, said Glendale Police Sgt. Chris Loop. 
</P>
<P>
The man was carrying the liquid in a glass jar, Loop said. 
</P>
<P>
Eloyan was treated at Glendale Adventist Hospital and transferred Tuesday to 
the burn unit of County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Eloyan suffered burns to her eyes, chest and arms and is listed in serious but 
stable condition, hospital spokeswoman Adelaida De Lacerda said. She said 
Eloyan could lose her sight. 
</P>
<P>
Eloyan was on her way to a grocery store near her home when the incident 
occurred, police said. No motive has been established for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect fled on foot and is still at large, police said. 
</P>
<P>
He was described by witnesses as a slender Latino male in his 20s, wearing a 
bright blue shirt, black pants and sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale police homicide detectives are investigating the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Police and hospital officials said they have been unable to identify the 
chemical used in the attack.

6 ARRESTED IN GAMBLING RAID AT VIDEO ARCADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a Glendale video arcade and five other people were arrested on 
suspicion of gambling last week when officers discovered them playing blackjack 
in a locked back room of the business, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Hakoopian, 30, owner of Odyssey Video Arcade, was playing cards with 
friends in an office of the business at 213 S. Brand Blvd. when they were 
arrested about 5 p.m. Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Cards, a crap table and ledgers detailing debts of several hundred dollars were 
seized, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Odyssey Video Arcade is one of the largest arcades in Glendale and includes 
several billiard tables. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they have no evidence of gambling at other such establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Hakoopian declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested were Karapet Martirosyan, 27; Haytham Shamaoun, 26, and Varant 
Krikoian, 19, all of Glendale; George Livingston, 19, of North Hollywood, and 
Hamid Mahmoozi, 27, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
All are scheduled to be arraigned in Glendale Municipal Court on Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
They face maximum sentences of six months in jail on the misdemeanor charges.

OXNARD TEACHERS' VOTE COULD END BITTER DISPUTE OVER SALARY, BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard School District teachers will begin voting next week on a tentative 
agreement that could spell the end of an acrimonious contract dispute that was 
characterized by strike threats and a failed recall drive aimed at a school 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached last week, would give teachers a 2% retroactive raise 
for the 1988-89 school year, followed by a 7% raise during the coming school 
year and a 6.5% raise the next year. It would also reinstate full health care 
benefits beginning next year and would include a $300 cash bonus for each 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Without a tentative agreement, the mean salary for district teachers is $29,396 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Oxnard Educators Assn., which represents the district's 500 
teachers, said the bonus will recoup some of the teachers' expenses for health 
care benefits, which the district reduced last fall. Since that time, teachers 
have paid $84 a month toward their health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lottery Funds 
</P>
<P>
Teachers would also keep a 3% cash bonus from state lottery funds awarded early 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the union would drop 11 charges of unfair labor practices filed 
against the district with the state Public Employee Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
School district Supt. Norman Brekke said the deal could not have been made 
without funds obtained under Proposition 98. This year alone, the school 
funding measure will bring the district an additional $600,000 from the state 
budget surplus, more than half of which will go to benefits and raises for the 
teachers, the union calculated. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ecstatic," Brekke said of the possibility of a resolution to 
negotiations that started in September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lukewarm Reception 
</P>
<P>
Mark Prim, teachers' union bargaining chairman, was not so enthusiastic. He 
predicted that the package will meet with a lukewarm reception from teachers 
but will ultimately win their support in voting sessions Monday, Tuesday and 
Aug. 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as much money as we expected," he said. "If we get the vote, it's 
because people want this thing over, not so much because of the terms of the 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Acrimony in the contract dispute, which Prim characterized as the most bitter 
in memory, peaked last month when 89% of the district's teachers voted to go on 
strike if a settlement had not been reached by this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Antagonism also ran high in November, when teachers launched an unsuccessful 
recall drive aimed at Jack Fowler, the school board member they said was least 
sympathetic to their requests. 
</P>
<P>
The district consists of 16 elementary and intermediate schools through the 
eighth grade in Oxnard. High schools are in a separate district.

The Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control is now providing 
full service to La Mirada, South Gate and Whittier. All three cities were 
previously served by the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals, which closed its facility in South Gate on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from the county Animal Care Center in Downey, 11258 S. Garfield Ave., 
will patrol the three cities for strays, respond to emergencies, answer 
complaints, enforce the leash law, investigate animal abuse cases, remove 
wildlife from homes and yards and provide many other animal-related services. 
</P>
<P>
Lost and stray animals found in these cities will be sheltered at the Downey 
facility. Additionally, the City of Commerce will house animals at the shelter 
under a limited contract with the county. All other animal control 
responsibilities will continue to be handled by the City of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The Downey Animal Care Center is open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays and from 
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends. It is closed holidays. Stray animals are held for 
seven days to allow their owners time to locate them.

WEAVER FANS SPECULATION IN VENTURA 
</P>

<P>
Professional boxing returned to the Ventura Theatre on July 12 and the presence 
of Mike Weaver led to speculation that the former World Boxing Assn. 
heavyweight champion might be featured on a future card. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver, 38, now residing in Diamond Bar, was on hand first and foremost to 
watch his 25-year-old brother Lloyd box in a middleweight bout. But he did 
express interest in returning in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be happy to fight here or anywhere, it makes no difference to me," Weaver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver holds the World Boxing Assn. Americas heavyweight title by virtue of a 
first-round knockout of Lionel Washington at the Forum in May. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-2, 212-pound champion, who trains at the Jet Center in Van Nuys, 
said that he is working harder than ever and hopes to be back in contention for 
a major title fight. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, Weaver will focus his energies on a July 27 WBAA title defense 
against Phil Brown at the Felt Forum in New York City. But he is definitely 
looking ahead to bigger game. 
</P>
<P>
"George Foreman has turned me down two times already and as I work my way back 
to a world title I would like to get another shot at Michael Dokes on the way 
back up," Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
LBA Associates promoter Buddy Bereal, however, said it was premature to project 
Weaver boxing in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say anything right now," said Bereal. "Mike already has some fights 
scheduled, including a possible fight against Trevor Berbick, but we have 
talked about it and Mike told me he would fight anytime, anywhere for me, 
including Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his renewed career interests, Mike Weaver was more than a casual 
spectator as Lloyd continued his progression through the middleweight ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to watch my brother fight tonight," Weaver said. "I get more nervous 
when they fight -- now I know how my mother felt. I'm concerned about their 
future and mine too." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver speaks collectively of his brothers -- they are triplets. Lloyd, also 
residing in Diamond Bar, improved his record to 8-1 with a unanimous decision 
over Pedro Riveron of Las Vegas in a preliminary fight on the four-bout card. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the Weaver stable boasts similarly impressive numbers. Floyd, 
a junior middlewweight, is 9-2 and Troy, a light heavyweight, is 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
In other fights on the Ventura card, Art Lizarraga of Bakersfield won a 
unanimous decision over Stewart Baines of Pasadena in a welterweight bout, and 
George Rodriguez of Highland Park scored a unanimous decision over Vinnie 
Falzone of Las Vegas in a light heavyweight match. 
</P>
<P>
In the main event, featherweight Johnnie Chavez of Azusa improved to 6-0, with 
a close, eight-round unanimous decision over Angel "Peewee" Garcia of Las 
Vegas. The card attracted an audience of 500.

LURE OF FRISBEES CAPTIVATES A DIVERSE CLIENTELE RANGING FROM CHILDREN TO 
VETERAN CONNOISSEURS OF AN ULTIMATE PASTIME 
</P>

<P>
Dave Lorenzen considers a Frisbee standard equipment when he takes his family 
on camping trips. Whenever his kids get restless, out come the moon-shaped 
plastic discs. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzen never viewed a Frisbee as anything other than a plastic pacifier, 
however, until his sons, Casey, 9, and Rick, 7, entered the World Junior 
Frisbee Disc contest at Peach Hill Park in Moorpark last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even after Casey and Rick had signed up, it was still hard for Lorenzen to 
take a Frisbee contest seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"We started practicing about five minutes before we got here," Lorenzen said. 
</P>
<P>
Casey and Rick Lorenzen could have used more practice, as both youngsters 
failed to score enough points to advance to the World Junior Frisbee Disc 
regional championships Aug. 5 at Victory Park in Pasadena. The Lorenzen 
brothers needed to score 15 points in three divisions -- accuracy, throwing and 
catching -- to advance. 
</P>
<P>
Maritza Torres, 15, of Moorpark, was all business in the competition and her 
approach paid off. Torres is the first girl in three years of the Moorpark 
tournament to qualify for the regionals. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been practicing real hard for this contest with my parents," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 of the top juniors, age 16 and younger, from throughout the 
western United States are expected to compete in the regional championships 
next month in Pasadena. The top finishers will advance to the World Junior 
Frisbee Finals Oct. 18-22 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The world junior champion receives a $1,000 savings bond and the second-place 
finisher wins a $500 savings bond. 
</P>
<P>
For Wham-O, which manufactures Frisbees, the annual contests help to introduce 
the popular plastic toys to a new generation of disc jockeys each year. 
</P>
<P>
For older Frisbee aficionados who never had the chance to compete in organized 
contests, there is another popular use for the toy -- ultimate Frisbee, a sport 
which combines the nonstop action of soccer with the passing and catching of 
football. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimate Frisbee is most popular with former college jocks who never got 
playing with a Frisbee out of their system, according to Ron Rauch, executive 
director of the New York-based Ultimate Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Most ultimate Frisbee players start off by playing other sports -- soccer, 
basketball, football or lacrosse -- and then they come over to this sport," 
Rauch said. 
</P>
<P>
Rauch estimates there are more than 20,000 ultimate Frisbee players nationwide 
who compete on club teams, in summer leagues or in intramural programs. Members 
of the Ultimate Players Assn. cap each season at a national championship 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
For the super-serious ultimate Frisbee player there is the World Championships. 
Sixteen countries competed in last year's world championships held in Leuven, 
Belgium, which was won by a team from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In ultimate Frisbee, a seven-man team advances down a 70-yard field by passing. 
A point is scored when a player catches the Frisbee in the end zone. Games can 
last up to four hours depending on the point ceiling that is determined before 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
Rauch estimates that the Frisbee is the main attraction to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"A ball goes up and comes down, there's not a lot you can do with it," Rauch 
said. "You can bank a Frisbee or make it rise over a defender. It's a sport 
which demands an incredible amount of conditioning just to compete." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hayden, 31, of Moorpark, has been involved with Wild Fling, a 
Camarillo-based ultimate Frisbee team for the past five years. He was 
introduced to the sport by his wife, Elaine, who competed in ultimate Frisbee 
in college. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always loved team sports like football or basketball," Hayden said. 
"There is a lot of action involved and it is a real fast-moving sport. You can 
do a lot more with a Frisbee than with a conventional football." 
</P>
<P>
While Wham-O makes Frisbees, it cannot take credit for ultimate Frisbee. The 
sport originated in Maplewood, N.J., in 1968 when a group of reporters on the 
newspaper at Columbia High invented a game involving a Frisbee. Ultimate 
Frisbee quickly became popular with college students, which led to the first 
intercollegiate ultimate Frisbee game between Princeton and Rutgers in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Today, ultimate Frisbee is played in 25 countries and it continues to attract 
new converts, according to Rauch.

2 EX-HUD OFFICIALS PLAYED ROLE IN BEVERLY HILLS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deborah Gore Dean and Thomas T. Demery, former officials who now occupy center 
stage in the scandals unfolding at the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, were involved in a controversial ruling that allowed a Beverly 
Hills senior citizens' apartment to restrict most of its units to city 
residents, thus excluding many minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, a once-powerful assistant to former Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development Samuel R. Pierce, has been accused of handing out lucrative 
political favors to well-connected Republicans. Demery, former assistant 
secretary, is a central figure in a congressional inquiry for backing a charity 
that accepted gifts from unusually large numbers of developers who got HUD 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Their involvement in the 1987 Beverly Hills decision -- which has not been 
linked to the HUD scandal -- was revealed in internal memos and correspondence 
from HUD recently reviewed by The Times. The documents show that Demery and 
Dean were instrumental in obtaining decisions in 1987 from Pierce and a HUD 
attorney that allowed Beverly Hills to turn away outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), whose subcommittee is conducting the 
congressional investigation into HUD, said Wednesday that the Beverly Hills 
decision "raises some troubling new issues involving HUD and apparently some of 
the former key HUD officials. I am asking the subcommittee to look into this 
problem as soon as we're able to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Lantos was referring to questions of whether the Pierce decision violated the 
spirit of HUD's civil rights regulations. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents, Demery took an unusual step in 1987, ignoring HUD 
officials at the Los Angeles field office, San Francisco regional office and 
Washington headquarters who had ordered the 150-unit building open to all 
applicants to avoid racial discrimination. (Under HUD rules, tenant selection 
cannot intend discrimination or have a discriminatory effect.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Went Directly to Pierce 
</P>
<P>
Demery went directly to Pierce, asking him to restrict at least half of the 
units to Beverly Hills residents because the city had donated the land and 
extra money for apartment balconies and amenities. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo signed by Dean, Pierce in May overturned the previous rulings, 
setting the number of units reserved for Beverly Hills residents at 70%. 
</P>
<P>
In justifying the restriction, city officials had claimed that 1,500 local 
residents were in need of affordable housing. But when 3,100 applications 
poured in, only 225 were from Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
A HUD official in Washington, speaking on guarantee of anonymity, said it was 
"not at all typical" for Pierce to become involved in details of such a small 
project. 
</P>
<P>
As local officials had predicted, the subsidized apartments, for which tenants 
paid less than $400 a month, went overwhelmingly to Anglos. According to HUD 
documents, Anglos got 88% of the 150 units. Only 19 minorities were accepted, 
including nine Asians, seven blacks and three Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Former Beverly Hills Mayor Benjamin Stansbury said Wednesday that Pierce 
himself had promised the city it could ban outsiders "long before construction 
even began," but other HUD officials "changed the rules on us later." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defends Restriction 
</P>
<P>
Stansbury defended the restriction, saying the city had many needy residents 
despite its image as a wealthy enclave. But in the end, he said, local 
residents "were kind of shy and uncomfortable about applying, and didn't come 
forward like we expected." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, Demery and Dean could not be reached for comment. But a letter from 
California HUD officials in May, 1987, to the Menorah Housing Foundation -- the 
project's nonprofit developer -- stated that their criteria banning outsiders 
"was not approved by HUD." 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Srery, executive director of Menorah Housing Foundation, which 
specializes in HUD housing for seniors, said that while HUD made no formal 
commitment, "We had been told it was certainly possible, given the financial 
help from the city, to restrict the building to Beverly Hills. . . . It was 
pretty much told to us in '83 or '84: 'You come up with a lot of the costs' " 
and restrictions would be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute simmered long after Pierce's May ruling. In September, Tom Honore, 
HUD's fair housing director in Los Angeles, wrote to Benjamin F. Bobo, manager 
of the local HUD office, stating: "The demand for multifamily rental housing in 
Los Angeles County is so intense that to restrict tenancy, even partially, to 
the residents of Beverly Hills . . . would nullify the efforts and objectives" 
of HUD civil rights requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The documents show that Dean entered the picture amid lobbying by Carla Hills, 
a former secretary of HUD and now U.S. trade representative. Hills, who in 1987 
was practicing law in Washington, was hired by the city of Beverly Hills, 
Stansbury said. 
</P>
<P>
In congressional testimony this week, Hills said she was paid by developers on 
projects around the country to lobby for funds from HUD programs now under 
investigation. She said she approached Dean on behalf of Beverly Hills, and was 
told by Dean that a decision had already been made in Beverly Hills' favor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought Legal Opinion 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks later, at Hills' request, Dean sought a legal opinion from HUD 
lawyers, documents show. The city wanted assurances that the 70% restriction on 
the project could be applied to a huge waiting list of mostly non-residents, 
which included hundreds of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
On July 12, 1987, HUD attorney J. Michael Dorsey wrote an opinion that the 70% 
restriction was legal, and that future selections from the waiting list could 
be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling among fair-housing people -- experts in this field -- was that 
Dorsey's ruling was weak," a HUD official in Los Angeles said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The rulings in Beverly Hills' favor were particularly controversial because 
they were announced just before and just after a number of other Southern 
California cities were ordered not to restrict outside residents from living in 
HUD-financed projects in their communities.

GUARD FIRED AFTER ALLEGEDLY HELPING 5 ESCAPE FROM JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A guard at the downtown federal Metropolitan Detention Center was fired amid 
allegations that he smuggled a pair of hacksaw blades to five inmates who 
escaped from the high-rise jail last month, authorities confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Two inmates involved in the escape now contend that the guard, who was not 
identified by federal officials, accepted $5,000 to smuggle in two 
diamond-tipped blades that were subsequently used to grind through a metal mesh 
enclosure on the eighth-floor exercise balcony, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, one of the inmates, Victor Age, 31, who was 
recaptured after the escape, described the guard's role in the breakout attempt 
and said prisoners persuaded another employee at the jail medical facility to 
unwittingly give them access to a supply of bedsheets, which they strung 
together to descend eight floors to the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
As dozens of inmates in the unit kept watch over the sole guard on the floor -- 
who apparently was watching television -- two men filed away at the metal mesh 
for nearly three hours, Age said. Shortly after 10:30 p.m., five inmates, 
including Age, rappelled down the west side of the building, where a pickup 
truck waited for them. 
</P>
<P>
"We got on the freeway and got the hell away from there," Age said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyn Croasmun, spokeswoman for the detention facility, said an investigation is 
under way to determine whether the guard, whom Age identified as a part-time 
employee who worked on weekends, was involved in the escape attempt. 
Authorities are also investigating allegations that he smuggled drugs into the 
facility, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a possibility, and we are investigating it," she said. Though no 
criminal charges have been filed, "that's a possibility, too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the investigation said it would be difficult for visitors to 
smuggle in contraband to the prison because of heavy security, including metal 
detectors, in the visitor section. "So it'd just about have to be staff," one 
source said. "It's a well-known feeling that they do not pay those detention 
officers well," the source added. "So there is, in my opinion, all the room in 
the world. They are good targets, I should say, for bribery." 
</P>
<P>
The $36-million, 10-story detention center opened in December, designed in part 
to safely handle pretrial prisoners who were considered too risky to house at 
the Terminal Island federal prison facility, said by officials to pose more 
security problems. 
</P>
<P>
Age, who faces a minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum of two life terms 
for his conviction as an armed career criminal, scoffed at the idea that the 
new jail is an improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"They said this building is, like, escape proof," he said. "It's ridiculous. 
You know what I think they should really do with this place is turn it over to 
a chain of hotels, and build themselves a new prison." 
</P>
<P>
One of Age's fellow escapees, Lester McDougherty, 31, broke his leg during the 
descent and was apprehended about five hours later within blocks of the Alameda 
Street facility. Age was arrested June 24 in Anaheim after a woman said he had 
dragged her into his truck and raped her at knifepoint. Age has not been 
charged in the rape, but officials are investigating the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photo on TV 
</P>
<P>
Six days later, Costa Mesa police arrested Kevin Greene, 32, after a woman who 
saw his photo on television identified him as the man living in a travel 
trailer near her home. 
</P>
<P>
Two other escapees -- suspected of kidnaping and attacking a patron at a 
Wilmington bar on the night of the escape -- remain at large. Officials 
identified them as James David Wilson, 31, and Robert Garrison, 43. 
</P>
<P>
Croasmun said extra security measures have already been adopted at the downtown 
detention facility, including an increase in the number of officers in the 
eighth-floor unit, camera surveillance on the exterior of the jail and a new 
armed guard posted outside the jail. In addition, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons 
has approved 48 new guards for the Los Angeles facility, Croasmun said. 
</P>
<P>
Age said the original mastermind of the escape -- who later declined to join in 
-- approached the guard more than two months before the escape and offered him 
$5,000 to smuggle in the blades. The guard agreed to meet a friend of the 
inmates on the street outside, where he was handed the money and the blades, 
Age said. "He just simply walked them in. He brought them in and gave them to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to make the escape on the night of June 17 was "pretty much a 
spontaneous thing," Age said. At first, everyone on the floor wanted to go. 
Then several changed their minds. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. marshals supervisor, William Woolsey, said investigators believe that 
all four escapees who made it away from the jail were at the Barrel House 
cocktail lounge in Wilmington a little over two hours after the escape, when 
Wilson allegedly attacked and kidnaped a patron at the bar. The patron told 
authorities that Wilson forced him to drive him and Garrison all over the 
Harbor area until his truck ran out of gas.

ATTEMPT TO SAVE CARWASH IS SCRUBBED BY L.A. PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A campaign to turn a Studio City carwash into a cultural monument was scrubbed 
Wednesday when Los Angeles officials decided the place was too common looking 
-- and its customers were not uncommon enough. 
</P>
<P>
Dashing the hopes of residents who tried to thwart construction of a mini-mall 
on the site, members of the city's Cultural Heritage Commission voted 4 to 0 
against a landmark designation for the carwash and an adjoining gas station and 
coffee shop after several preservation experts testified against the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners said the 28-year-old automotive complex fails to meet the city's 
criteria as a cultural treasure. Those guidelines include requirements that 
such sites either have "the distinguishing characteristics of an 
architectural-type specimen" or be "identified with historic personages or with 
important events." 
</P>
<P>
The vote clears the way for a developer who owns the southeast corner of 
Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards to remove the three buildings and start 
construction of a new $15-million mini-mall in 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners' unhappiness with builder Ira Smedra's shopping center plan had 
sparked the unusual cultural monument application -- which in recent weeks 
attracted worldwide attention as the latest example of Los Angeles' wacky love 
affair with the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
A monument designation, if ratified by the City Council, would have delayed 
Smedra's demolition plans for up to one year. That would have given supporters 
time to try to persuade Smedra to somehow incorporate the carwash, gas station 
and Tiny Naylor's restaurant in his project, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the cultural panel had indicated last month that they were split 2 
to 1 in favor of the designation. A formal vote was delayed until Wednesday to 
allow a newly appointed fourth commission member to take his seat on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners told the panel that the carwash, which is topped by three 
55-foot-tall, boomerang-shaped steel beams, serves as "the gateway to Studio 
City." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Example of Car Culture 
</P>
<P>
"A landmark doesn't have to be a statue of a Yankee general," said Kathy 
Negele, who lives a few blocks from the carwash's beams. She urged that they be 
preserved as an example of San Fernando Valley car culture. 
</P>
<P>
But historian Portia Lee testified against the application, asserting that the 
origin of the carwash boomerang is uncertain. "History is not instant, even in 
Southern California," she said, noting that the carwash was built in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Knox Mellon, retired director of the State Office of Historical Preservation, 
said the carwash meets neither architectural nor historical landmark 
guidelines. He warned that designation of such a "marginal" site could haunt 
the city panel in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The only commission support for the carwash came from its president, Amarjit S. 
Marwah. He said the site meets the city's cultural criteria, adding, "I'm 
personally against mini-malls and Mickey Mouse developments. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
When it became clear he was outnumbered, Marwah joined the other commissioners 
in making the vote unanimous, however.

<P>
Save-the-car-wash campaign leader Jack McGrath said residents will urge City 
Councilman Joel Wachs, whose district includes the carwash corner, to ignore 
the commission action and ask council colleagues to approve the cultural 
designation anyway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Memories for Children 
</P>
<P>
"We've very disappointed," McGrath said. "We've demolished so many things in 
the San Fernando Valley. We haven't kept any memories for our kids." 
</P>
<P>
Wachs was unavailable for comment after the meeting. One of his chief deputies, 
Greg Nelson, said it is uncertain whether the City Council "can make an end run 
around the commission. . . . We're trying right now to find out what we can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Smedra, meantime, urged residents to work with him in deciding on the final 
touches for his proposed 53,000-square-foot, two-story shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
One of those touches, he hinted, might just be the 55-foot-tall boomerangs. 
"We've offered to donate them to the L.A. Conservancy," Smedra said. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Rounds, executive director of the Los Angeles Conservancy, said his group's 
preservation officer is investigating Smedra's offer. 
</P>
<P>
"It has always been our policy to favor preservation of things on the original 
site wherever possible," Rounds said.

STUDIO SHOOTING BLAMED ON BUSINESS DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The man who burst through a Lorimar Studios gate and emptied a shotgun into a 
sound stage before taking his own life had gone to the Culver City lot to 
confront "Dallas" television star Ken Kercheval, his foil in a bitter dispute 
over a popcorn business, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Edward P. Phillips, 43, formerly of Corydon, Ind., apparently blamed Kercheval, 
who acquired full ownership of the popcorn company last year, for cheating him 
out of the business and causing his marriage to fail, investigators and 
associates said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to confront Kercheval, Phillips came to Los Angeles on Monday and drove 
to the Culver City lot in a rented truck Tuesday evening, police said. Unable 
to talk his way past a guard, he rammed through the gate, set fire to the truck 
and opened fire on the sound stage where "Dallas" is filmed. 
</P>
<P>
When police closed in, Phillips turned the gun on himself. He died from a 
single blast to the chest. The sound stage was empty and no other injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Kercheval, who plays oil tycoon Cliff Barnes, nor other "Dallas" actors 
were on the lot that day. Police later found a practice hand grenade and 
canisters of a poisonous insecticide on the front seat of Phillips' truck. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives and acquaintances of Phillips who were interviewed Wednesday 
presented a picture of a bitter, distraught man who was disturbed by a string 
of personal and financial losses over recent years: his business, his wife, 
and, ultimately, the legal battles he had mounted to win compensation for his 
lost company. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was angry over being Xed out of the business and was intending to 
see Kercheval," said Culver City Police Sgt. Hank Davies. "His marriage broke 
up (and) he had lost his business." 
</P>
<P>
By several accounts, Phillips blamed much of his ill fortune on Kercheval. 
</P>
<P>
Kercheval, in a statement issued through a publicist, said he was "shocked and 
astonished" by the suicide incident. The 54-year-old actor said that after he 
bought out Phillips' popcorn business, Phillips "on several occasions exhibited 
irrational behavior that frightened my family and associates." 
</P>
<P>
However, Kercheval added: "I had no idea this would be the result." 
</P>
<P>
According to Culver City police, information from former business associates 
and news reports, Kercheval in 1985 bought a third of the Old Capital Popcorn 
Co. from Phillips and his wife at the time, Linda Phillips, for nearly $1 
million. The Phillipses helped Kercheval finance the loan and paid him a 
monthly stipend from company earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership appeared to go well at first, with Kercheval's presence -- his 
picture was used on cartons of the popcorn -- attracting publicity. They were 
even featured in a segment of TV's "Life Styles of the Rich and Famous." 
</P>
<P>
But the partnership began to sour. Several bad marketing decisions cut into 
profits and there was friction over hiring. Finally, in April of last year, 
Kercheval and Linda Phillips joined forces to oust Edward Phillips from the 
business. She sued for divorce shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Kercheval then agreed to pay the Phillipses $309,000 for their two-thirds share 
in the business -- ultimately obtaining for $1.3 million a company that the 
Phillipses had bought for $2.01 million in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, I didn't care if I lived or died," Phillips told the Louisville 
Courier-Journal newspaper. Phillips later admitted himself to an Ohio hospital 
for three days to recover from depression, the Courier-Journal reported in an 
April 9 chronicle of Old Capital Popcorn's plight. 
</P>
<P>
Kercheval said all parties agreed to the sale of the firm after "management 
problems" arose. He said he had not seen or spoken to Phillips in at least a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Multiple Legal Actions 
</P>
<P>
Phillips sued Kercheval, Old Capital countersued Phillips and the popcorn firm 
has also been sued by at least two suppliers who claim they were not paid for 
services. 
</P>
<P>
A former business associate said the relationship between Kercheval and 
Phillips was mismatched and tense from the start. "One was debonair and 
polished, and one was off a farm," said Allan Simmons, hired by Kercheval in 
1987 as sales vice president for the popcorn company. "Can you imagine two guys 
like this as roommates? Wouldn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Before the popcorn venture, Phillips, who held a degree in farm economics, 
owned a farm equipment dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, whom Kercheval fired a year after hiring him, said that although his 
position with the company was in marketing, he wound up "spending as much time 
dealing with their problems as I did getting out there and selling their 
product." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons said that Kercheval was a "gentle, charitable" man who seemed to change 
at times "into the role of a ruthless businessman. I think he (Kercheval) plays 
the role in real life that he plays on TV sometimes," said Simmons of Aptos, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillipses, who have three children, made their divorce final in January. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Just Too Much' 
</P>
<P>
Linda Phillips, in a telephone interview from Corydon, Ind., told The Times 
that she had spoken to her ex-husband just a few days ago. But she declined to 
comment further: "It's just too much right now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Phillips also said that her husband "had been having psychological 
problems for some time in trying to deal with all this (the business losses and 
divorce)," Davies said. "She blamed it on him (Phillips). She said he blamed 
other people for his failures in the business." 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that since the divorce, Edward Phillips lived with his parents 
in Carroll, Ohio, a small, rural town of 640 inhabitants 20 miles southeast of 
Columbus. His father, a dentist, Dr. E. P. Phillips, told The Times: "We're 
very hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were still tracing the weapon he used and the grenade found in 
his car. 
</P>
<P>
Before crashing into the Lorimar lot, Phillips handed several items to a 
security guard. There were two canisters of a poisonous chemical identified as 
methyl bromide, which is used in fumigants. 
</P>
<P>
And there was an envelope containing a greeting card with a handwritten note 
addressed to Kercheval and a news article. Its headline read: "Dreams, Feuds, 
Love, Lawsuits -- and Popcorn."

On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission rejected a request 
to designate a Studio City carwash-gas station-restaurant a cultural monument, 
saying it has no architectural significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this application for monument status did not succeed, Los Angeles 
does have a number of seemingly offbeat official landmarks. In the last 27 
years, officials have declared 440 houses, structures, oddities and other 
locations as historic-cultural monuments. Of those, 90% are the usual buildings 
or residences that come to mind when we think of landmarks. The remaining 10% 
include more unusual items. Here is a sampler: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

in 1875 and described as "the greatest of Australian avenue trees." 
</P>
<P>
Oak Tree, Louise Avenue south of Ventura Boulevard, Encino: Judged to be more

</P>
<P>
Two Stone Gates, Beachwood, Westshire and Belden drives, Hollywood: Built by 
European stonemasons in the early 1920s as the entrance to Hollywoodland

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OIL TANKER SLIGHTLY DAMAGED IN MISHAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A loaded Exxon oil tanker collided with a dredge Sunday after its bow snagged 
an anchor cable while entering the Port of Long Beach, the Coast Guard 
disclosed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 900-foot Exxon North Slope scraped against the dredge Florida despite 
evasive steering action by the tanker crew, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Paul Larson, 
head of the agency's investigation section in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker's right side suffered minor damage, with no oil spillage or 
injuries. Four remaining anchors held the 490-foot dredge in place. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker proceeded to a berth to discharge its load of crude oil from Valdez, 
Alaska. Divers inspected the ship's hull after docking and found no indication 
of punctures.

2 OFFICERS DID THEIR BEST TO STOP GANG FIGHT, LAPD SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Los Angeles police officers who last week accompanied a procession of gang 
members to what turned into a brawl with a rival gang were expressly given the 
assignment to prevent trouble, a police spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the officers could not have stopped the turn of events "under the 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Police Cmdr. William Booth said a total of six police officers stopped the 
procession several blocks before it reached 90th Place near Normandie Avenue, 
where the brawl occurred, but had no cause to make arrests. Only two of the 
officers continued along with the procession. 
</P>
<P>
Despite reports from residents that many of the gang members were drinking from 
open beer bottles and could have been arrested for violation of the law, Booth 
said the officers observed no illegalities. 
</P>
<P>
"The streets are public and we want to keep them public," said Booth, citing 
the rights of all citizens, including known gang members, to walk anywhere as 
long as they stay within the law. "The officers had observed (the youths) doing 
nothing illegal and had no reason to arrest them." 
</P>
<P>
The officers did the best job they could by being on hand to call for 
reinforcements once the two gang factions clashed, Booth said. Nevertheless, he 
added, the Police Department will probably increase the number of police 
observers at gang funerals and wakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We might do our monitoring with more officers, officers who are aware of what 
happened" on 90th Place, Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Only one police car was on hand at the time of the brawl, he said, because "we 
thought that would be enough." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the July 12 incident, 16 people, including 12 minors, were 
arrested. Later that night, an 18-year-old man was fatally wounded in a 
drive-by shooting that police believe stemmed from the brawl. 
</P>
<P>
Police have said that the 25 to 60 gang members were walking from a 
neighborhood park, where they had gone for a wake after a funeral for a slain 
comrade. 
</P>
<P>
Booth said the funeral and the dispersal of people from the wake was monitored 
by several officers because there had been what he called "hostilities" between 
the two groups the week before. Other police sources said privately that the 
gangs were embroiled in a vicious turf war that had resulted in two slayings. 
Residents said members of one gang had shot up homes frequented by members of 
the other on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral that preceded the brawl was for one of the slain youths. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guns Reported 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the brawl started, members from the rival gang group were 
standing with two sheriff's deputies complaining that members of the other gang 
had passed by and pointed guns at them. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Robert Rifkin, a Sheriff's Department investigator, said earlier in the 
week that the two LAPD officers, though assigned to an anti-gang unit, were 
inexperienced and did not know in whose gang territory they were traveling. 
There was no radio communication between the LAPD unit and two sheriff's 
deputies who were already on 90th Place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rifkin, who is investigating the brawl because it happened in an unincorporated 
area under the jurisdiction of the Sheriff's Department and who had said the 
LAPD officers made an "honest mistake," declined to answer further questions 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
His supervisor, Lt. Chuck Brantley, agreed with Booth that the LAPD officers 
had done all they could have done to prevent the brawl. Brantley said, however, 
that the enormity of the gang problem and the fact that the police officers 
were greatly outnumbered probably contributed to the way they acted. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 700 gangs in the county. Every officer can't be familiar with every 
gang," he said. "The situation has gotten so out of hand it is hard to tell who 
is fighting who when. 
</P>
<P>
"Those officers were victims. How are two guys going to arrest 60 gang 
members," he continued. "They did everything exactly right. They stood back and 
waited until enough units got there. They got help right away and no one was 
seriously hurt."

OFFICIALS SEEKING TO MUFFLE THE TURNED-UP NOISE OF 'BOOMING' VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two sleek mini-trucks cruised slowly through the beach parking lot, proclaiming 
their presence with a steady beat of high-powered booms that rolled from the 
pickups to the sea, out-rumbling the surf. 
</P>
<P>
On this blue, lazy beach day in Long Beach, Jesse Gonzalez and Eddie Lopez were 
out "booming" in their mini-trucks, playing the usual bass-heavy rap and soul 
music to shake up their cabs a bit and let the Cherry Avenue beach crowd know 
they were around. 
</P>
<P>
In the ever-evolving world of car crazes, "boom cars" packed with elaborate, 
expensive and achingly loud stereo systems have become a nationally accepted 
badge of status for the young and the male, as well as an earsplitting 
annoyance to anyone within their expansive range. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Latest Fad 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that's going on right now," Lopez said, explaining, with 
simplicity if not insight, why he has spent nearly $5,000 on sound equipment 
and collected $1,200 in tickets for playing it too loudly. "When hot rodding 
was in, why did you want to speed?" 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, a hefty 21-year-old trash collector from Long Beach, cruises in a black 
Chevrolet mini-truck that seems propelled not by the forces of internal 
combustion, but by waves of sound that vibrate his cab seat with a nervous 
jiggle. On his truck's hood is a spray-painted mural of a figure of death 
carrying a limp woman. 
</P>
<P>
"She died of sound, too much sound," a friend quipped. 
</P>
<P>
It is too much for many communities that compare boomers' sonic stakeouts to a 
recurring migraine headache. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Long Beach, southeast Los Angeles County cities and Los Angeles 
have been trying to dull the thump of boom cars with ticket-writing crackdowns 
and in some cases, anti-noise ordinances. A state senator from Norwalk has even 
introduced a bill, passed by the Senate and now before the Assembly, that would 
make it a violation of the state Vehicle Code to play a vehicle's sound system 
so loudly that it can be heard at a distance of 25 feet or more. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to sit at signals next to some of the deaf turkeys that own boom 
boxes and my whole body vibrated. They are a nuisance as well as a hazard," an 
angry Lakewood man wrote to Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk), who introduced the 
anti-boom bill at the behest of City Council members from boom-plagued 
Southeast cities. 
</P>
<P>
Even the hard of hearing are not immune. "I have been boomed until my bad ear 
had pain," an elderly Bellflower man wrote Bellflower City Councilman Randy 
Bomgaars, who has been crusading for quieter streets. "We're a society that's 
responding more and more to noise and chaos," Bomgaars complained. "We need to 
return to peace and tranquility." 
</P>
<P>
Audiologists warn that the thunderous volumes of boom systems damage the 
hearing of boom buffs, and local officials worry that boom car drivers, 
oblivious to emergency sirens, will careen into police cars and ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
Stories are legion of the decibel muscle of sophisticated car-music systems, 
which can take up the entire flatbed of a mini-truck. Speakers often number in 
the double digits in a single system, which typically costs from $2,000 to 
$15,000 but can range as high as $80,000. The sound can explode car windows, 
bulge doors and set speakers on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Police Lt. Ken Schack recalls one young man who pushed up the volume 
until he could flip a coin into the air. "Kaboommm, the quarter bounced up off 
the roof," said Schack, who has heard boom cars approach with their 
intimidating thumps from as far as four blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Design of the '80s 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a youth," Schack continued with a hint of nostalgia, "all the cars 
had been lowered in the back. Now we have stereo systems that nobody can get in 
the car and listen to because they die of traumatic injury." 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly, but the roar of super-loud systems does take its toll on ears. "No 
rational person would say these are safe levels," said Maurice H. Miller, chief 
of audiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Lincoln, co-owner of Car Radio Sound Center Inc. in Long Beach, says the 
average system he installs can attain volume levels of about 125 decibels, or 
about the same as an airplane engine. Workers exposed to that much noise in a 
factory would have to wear hearing protection. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez is not worried. "I haven't lost none of my hearing," said Lopez, whose 
3-year-old son, a budding boomer, likes to go cruising, even though he can 
barely see out the truck window. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez so far has spent about $1,800 outfitting his second mini-truck with a 
boom system. His first truck, in which he had installed $3,000 worth of sound 
equipment, "got taken away from me at gunpoint" by two men who rode off with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Minor Problem 
</P>
<P>
The tickets Lopez and his buddies collect are seen as a relatively minor 
hindrance to the rites of booming. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't worry about them because all you do is pay," said Juan Chavez, a 
21-year-old forklift operator whose black net pullover and black pants matched 
his black Mazda mini-truck. He has been ticketed in Downey, Compton, Signal 
Hill and Long Beach. The noise citations average about $90 apiece but are not 
moving violations and do not go on a driver's record. 
</P>
<P>
Not that boomers want to get ticketed or think they deserve it. 
</P>
<P>
"This ain't no crime. We're not hurting nobody," argues Gonzalez, a bell 
captain at a Long Beach hotel who cranks up the 700-watt system that consumes 
half the bed of his mini-truck when the situation warrants it, such as, "Girls, 
other cars, competition. Whenever you want to show off." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez has what he calls "a police button" on his system. "It lowers the volume 
just like that." At his shop, Lincoln has even installed hidden switches on the 
floors of boom cars, enabling drivers to instantly silence their speakers 
without taking their hands off the wheel when a policeman rolls into view. 
</P>
<P>
But even boomers can grow weary of riding around with an insistent blare in 
their ears. "Sometimes I don't put it in for two days or a week. I get tired of 
it," admitted 21-year-old Lalo Ponce, who has a pullout tape deck in his Nissan 
mini-truck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Be Slackening 
</P>
<P>
While national sales of boom systems continue to soar about three years after 
the boom mania took hold, Lincoln says his boom system business has markedly 
declined during the last couple of years, from about 40% of his sales to 20%. 
He attributes the slump partly to police ticketing and partly to a police 
crackdown on cocaine sales, which he suspects have financed a lot of the boom 
systems he has installed. 
</P>
<P>
Cities, meanwhile, have begun to take action. Los Angeles in 1986 added a 
section to the city code prohibiting anyone from playing a car music system 
that can be heard for more than 200 feet in a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a universal complaint. It's just like graffiti. People are sick of it," 
Artesia City Councilman James Van Horn said.

VICO NOMAAEA, ON CHURCH MISSION IN SAMOA, STILL THINKING IT OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is winter in the tiny Pacific island chain of Western Samoa where Vico 
Nomaaea of Carson has spent almost two years. 
</P>
<P>
Nomaaea, a 1984 all-City basketball player from San Pedro High School, has been 
walking the rain forests, visiting remote villages in search of religious 
converts, oblivious to the speculation at home about his basketball plans. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-3 guard, who buried three-point shots at Cal State Dominguez Hills 
as often as tropical rain falls in the islands, is completing a two-year 
mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Visiting faraway 
lands on religious missions is expected of Mormon men in their late teens or 
early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
Nomaaea's tour ends Sept. 7 and he has two years of college eligibility 
remaining. It is unclear, however whether he will return to Dominguez Hills. 
The Hawaii campus of Brigham Young University also wants his talents. Neither 
school has heard from Nomaaea. In a telephone conversation he said he is not 
sure what the next few months will bring. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'm going to do yet," he said from the mission house in 
Savaii, the main island of Western Samoa. It took a reporter two weeks to 
locate him. The few telephone lines into the country were interrupted by bad 
weather numerous times. Often it was impossible to get a line into the country, 
and getting Western Samoan operators to answer was frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
Not much is known as to the whereabouts of Nomaaea, even by church elders. He 
was located on the third try at dialing the mission home, but he was not in the 
house. He was "out in the field" according to the house mother. Nomaaea was 
expected back the following Monday (the call was placed on a Thursday), and, 
although the quality of the phone line was weak, an appointment was made to 
call back at 9 a.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
Nomaaea made the appointment, but it is that kind of communication frustration 
that has kept college recruiters away. Nomaaea said he had not used a telephone 
in some time. 
</P>
<P>
Winter in the Samoan Islands is very much like winter in Hawaii. The trade wind 
blows and it rains a bit more. Still, it is a busy time for Nomaaea, who has 
worked himself into a leadership position in the search for converts. As a zone 
leader on remote locations, he says he has converted six persons and has 
another three waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Nomaaea, however, knew little about the interest his return is generating back 
home. Both Dominguez Hills and BYU-Hawaii have spoken with his parents, Willy 
and Rosie, who have moved several times since Vico left the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see him do whatever he wants, Willie Nomaaea said. "It's his 
future, not mine. I'm going to sit back and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore at Dominguez Hills (he sat out one season because of eligibility 
problems), Vico averaged 10.5 points, 3.1 assists and three rebounds a game. He 
is best remembered for his performance in a Western Regional playoff game when 
he carried a flu-riddled Toro team by sinking eight three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
But Vico, whose real name is Victor, cautioned that when he returns home he 
won't be up to his old playing form immediately. He has not played basketball 
in quite a while and, he said, is out of shape. In addition, he's not sure he 
has his head into the game, or into college, anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not jumping into school," he said. "I will miss the first few weeks 
anyway. I think I'll sit out the first quarter of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Nomaaea also said that basketball has been the last thing on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Over here the big sport is volleyball," he said. "For two years I have touched 
nothing but a volleyball. I don't know if I have my (shooting) touch now." 
</P>
<P>
He has gained from 35 to 50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a lot thicker," his father said. "He left at 182 pounds. Now he's 210 or 
215. I look at the pictures he sends me and I can see he has filled up. He's 
not really fat, just solid." 
</P>
<P>
Vico acknowledged that he has rounded out. 
</P>
<P>
"Eating Samoan food has put meat on my body," he said. "Lots of taro and poi. 
All we do is eat and walk, eat and walk." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors began circulating at Dominguez Hills last fall that Nomaaea would return 
to the Carson campus to play his junior year for Coach Dave Yanai. Word was 
that Willie Nomaaea, who plays in a recreational basketball league with Yanai, 
had guaranteed his son's return to a Toro uniform. 
</P>
<P>
But his father was noncommittal in a phone conversation. He indicated that Vico 
wanted to see what Dominguez Hills has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Most likely he's not coming back to Dominguez Hills," his father said. "He 
wants to talk to the coach, to see what the deal is." 
</P>
<P>
BYU-Hawaii, which heard about Nomaaea from a church member here on the 
mainland, is very interested in Nomaaea. 
</P>
<P>
"A Polynesian Mormon, you bet we are interested in him," said BYU-Hawaii Coach 
Chuck Hess. Hess admitted that he had not seen Nomaaea play. However, assistant 
Hiram Akina indicated that Nomaaea came so highly recommended that he could 
have a spot on the BYU-Hawaii team almost for the asking. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd love for him to sit down with us and talk," Akina said. 
</P>
<P>
BYU-Hawaii lost its top player, a popular Hawaiian, to a Mormon mission, Akina 
said. That makes Nomaaea a prized recruit. However, the college lost contact 
with Nomaaea's parents, who moved from Carson to Long Beach several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
School officials seemed delighted when a reporter from California called to 
inquire about their interest in Nomaaea. The reporter had the new phone number 
for Vico's parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a couple of letters from them," Vico said about BYU-Hawaii. "I'm not 
sure exactly what I am going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Akina said BYU-Hawaii could offer Nomaaea more than Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
which remains mum as to its financial plans for its former guard. 
</P>
<P>
Akina said Nomaaea is entitled to a free year of tuition at any BYU campus 
because of the time he has served on the church's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
A stumbling block for Nomaaea's return to Dominguez Hills has been his release 
date from the mission house. He is not due back in the United States until the 
second week of September. That would be the fourth week of classes. School 
officials said that would make it difficult to get Nomaaea enrolled in time to 
be eligible to play before January. 
</P>
<P>
Akina said that problem would not exist at BYU-Hawaii, an NAIA school also 
affiliated with the NCAA Division II, because the campus is affiliated with the 
Mormon church. He said he would ask the church to cut Nomaaea's mission short 
by about a month, if needed, so he could enroll at the Oahu campus in late 
August and be eligible to play basketball when the season begins in November. 
</P>
<P>
BYU-Hawaii seems to be taking a chance on Nomaaea, and Dominguez Hills, which 
would like to have him back, is prepared to march ahead without him. After 
Dominguez Hills managed a 20-11 record and a Western Regional Division II berth 
last year, Yanai was asked what he would do if Nomaaea returned. 
</P>
<P>
"We are recruiting as if he never comes back," he said. "But we certainly would 
like to see him here." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai had a fine recruiting year, but sources at the school say the addition of 
Nomaaea would give the team maturity. The Toros are expected to start only one 
senior next year. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hess: "I've never heard from (Nomaaea), but I would like to see him come 
here." 
</P>
<P>
And so Nomaaea walks the back roads of Western Samoa, looking for converts, 
unaware of the mounting interest on the mainland about his future. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been kind of busy here," he said. "It's been a different experience. I've 
noticed that I have grown a lot physically and spiritually. I'm 23 years old 
and I'm getting to know myself better." 
</P>
<P>
Nomaaea indicated that he wouldn't push basketball when he returns to Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"I might get back into the spirit when I get home. That might help me play ball 
again." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is, Vico Nomaaea has his fate in his hands. And yet, because of 
the difficulties in communicating in his part of the world, he is wandering the 
tropical islands of Western Samoa oblivious to the waiting game being played 
out back home.DR, PETE BENTOVOJA / Los Angeles Times

BEACH PRO SPIKES 100TH VOLLEYBALL TOURNEY WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sinjin Smith, the winningest player in the history of pro beach volleyball, 
remembers when Ron Von Hagen's career record of 62 tournament championships was 
considered unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
So Smith, who eclipsed that mark in 1986, has no similar misconceptions about 
the plateau he reached over the weekend -- 100 victories. In fact, he needs 
only to look to his left to see the man who will likely pass it. His partner, 
Randy Stoklos, has won 80 events and, at 28, is four years Smith's junior. 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect Randy to beat my record," Smith said after winning his 100th 
tournament, 15-13, over Mike Dodd and Tim Hovland in Mentor, Ohio. "It makes 
sense. He's one of the greatest players of all-time and, if he's able to get a 
good partner after I'm gone, he should do it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, however, doesn't appear to be leaving any time soon. "I feel better now 
than I did in the last two years -- or three years for that matter," he said. 
Smith and Stoklos, both residents of Pacific Palisades, have responded with 
four consecutive victories and five wins in their last six events, giving them 
nine tournament championships this season, tops on the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Discussion of Smith's record -- and his partner's constant position 20 
victories behind him -- inevitably leads to questions concerning Stoklos' 
future plans. Rumors before the season had Stoklos considering a split with 
Smith to team with Karch Kiraly or another top player in an effort to surpass 
Smith's victory mark. 
</P>
<P>
Smith heard the rumors too, but will not speculate as to what the future may 
bring. The present, he says, is too bright. 
</P>
<P>
But whether it's Smith or Stoklos who eventually retires from the tour with the 
record, it will be a long time before someone wins 100 tournaments, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd or Hovland -- Nos. 4 and 5 on the all-time list -- are certainly unlikely 
to get there. Both are 31 and have 50 and 46 tournament victories, 
respectively. And no other active player is close. (Next best is Kiraly, 28, 
with 26.) 
</P>
<P>
"With the growth of the sport, there are a lot of good teams out there," Smith 
said. "We've seen four teams win tournaments this year. Once this group of guys 
leaves -- Hovland, Dodd, myself, Pat Powers, Jon Stevenson and, a couple years 
behind, Randy and Karch -- it'll all be up for grabs." 
</P>
<P>
Such a competitive field will make it difficult for any one team to jump out 
and win consistently, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely, he added, that anyone will win as consistently as Von Hagen, the 
beach legend who put together that other "unbeatable" career victory mark in 
the 1960s and 1970s. It was breaking Von Hagen's record of 62 tournament wins 
that Smith considered his greatest accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's actually been the people around me that made my 100th win a big deal," he 
said. "The big deal for me was getting Ron Von Hagen's record. Everyone said it 
could never be beaten. Of course, when Ron played there were eight to 10 
tournaments a year (compared to 30 now). But still, that one was the thrill for 
me."

PREP ALL-AMERICAN CONWAY WILL ENROLL AT EL CAMINO BUT WON'T PLAY, SAYS COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prep All-American quarterback Curtis Conway of Hawthorne plans to enroll at El 
Camino College this fall as a part-time student but will not play football, 
according to El Camino Coach John Featherstone. 
</P>
<P>
Conway, one of USC's top recruits, was unable to enroll at USC this fall 
because he failed to score 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test in five tries. 
USC reportedly will honor its commitment to Conway if he passes the test this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone said Conway has agreed to take an English placement test in the 
first week of August, after which a level of studies will be determined for him 
at El Camino. By enrolling as a part-time student and not participating in 
sports, Conway will retain his full athletic eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a one-year plan without playing football," Featherstone said. "We are 
going to try to give him as many transferable classes as we can. 
</P>
<P>
"If he fails to pass the SAT, we hope that Curtis would be excited about 
playing for us (in 1990)." 
</P>
<P>
The versatile Conway has worked out with El Camino this summer as a wide 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Conway, twice named South Bay Back of the Year by The Times and the state 
100-meter champion, declined to comment. He will play for the South All-Stars 
in the Shrine Football Classic on July 29 at the Rose Bowl.

BANNING AND CARSON SHOW THEY'RE GRID POWERS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The annual football showdown between Banning and Carson isn't until Nov. 9, but 
the South Bay rivals got an early look at each other Saturday in the Pepsi 
Grid-Hoops Festival at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
The teams played three times, with Banning winning twice, including a 21-14 
victory in the finals of the 7-on-7 passing tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't thrown the ball against each other all spring," Banning Coach Joe 
Dominguez said. "But we made up for it." 
</P>
<P>
Carson, which had to come back from the losers bracket in the 32-team, 
double-elimination tournament, played six games Saturday. Coach Gene Vollnogle 
felt it was too many. 
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say, we were tired," he said. "There wasn't an hour rest in 
between (each game)." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle hinted that fatigue may have caught up with the Colts in the finals. 
After posting hard-fought victories over West Torrance and Banning, Carson 
moved out to a 14-0 lead before Banning rallied for three straight touchdowns 
to take the title. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback John Ma'ae, the tournament MVP, had a hand in all of the Pilot 
scores, including the game-winner on a seven-yard pass to Travis Davis on the 
last play. Ma'ae also returned an interception for a TD. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dominguez: "He's quite a talent." 
</P>
<P>
Carson forced a second game for the title after edging previously unbeaten 
Banning, 42-35, behind four touchdown catches by senior Tydus Winans. 
</P>
<P>
Sidelined most of last season with injuries, Winans performed impressively in 
the tournament and took fifth in the festival's 40-yard dash competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected that of him last year, but he never seemed to get healthy," 
Vollnogle said. "He was the guy we needed. We've always had one receiver who 
was extremely fast. The guys we had (last season) were fast, but not compared 
to this guy." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle compares Winans' speed to Brian Treggs, now at UC Berkeley, and 
Wesley Walker of the New York Jets, two of Carson's all-time receivers. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran coach said it was an oversight that Winans was not selected to the 
all-tournament team. Another Colt wide receiver, returning starter Michael 
Ross, was named to the squad. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael was deserving, but Tydus was even more deserving," Vollnogle said. 
"He's going to give people some problems this season." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Ross, senior quarterback Armin Youngblood and junior cornerback 
Clayvand Thomas of Carson earned all-tournament honors. 
</P>
<P>
Banning players joining Ma'ae on the team were senior cornerback Nizam Walter 
and junior wide receiver Michael James. 
</P>
<P>
Carson junior Fred Sims was the surprise winner of the festival's 40-yard dash, 
upsetting defending champion Andre Green of Long Beach Poly in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Sims, who is projected to play wide receiver or running back this season, won 
with a time of 4.45 seconds running into the wind. Green was second and Kevin 
Copeland of Dorsey was third. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery lineman Chris Maumalanga, a 6-foot-4, 320-pound senior, set 
festival records on all three of his lifts to capture the individual 
weightlifting title. 
</P>
<P>
Maumalanga lifted 390 pounds on the bench press, 870 on the hip sled and 
cleaned 300 to finish with a winning total of 1,560 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Powerful isn't the word for Chris," said Bishop Montgomery Coach Steve 
Carroll, who added that Maumalanga has been selected a preseason All-American 
by Blue Chip magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Banning won the team weightlifting title and the punting competition. The 
Pilots totaled 5,770 pounds on their top five lifts, beating Mater Dei by 20 
pounds. Mater Dei finished second to Carson last year. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance's football team, coming off two poor seasons, appears to be on 
its way back. The Warriors reached the semifinals of the Grid-Hoops Festival 
and two players -- junior quarterback John Walsh and senior running back Josh 
Moore -- made the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be very competitive for the next two years," West co-Coach John 
Black said. "It's nice because we've been on the bottom of it the last few 
years. It's time to pay back some people." 
</P>
<P>
West, which last reached the CIF playoffs in 1986, was 4-6 last season and 
1-8-1 the previous year. That's a far cry from what the Warriors accomplished 
earlier in the decade when they won the CIF Coastal Conference title in 1982 
and reached the semifinals in '83 under former Coach Fred Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
West's renewed hopes revolve around a talented group of juniors who were 10-0 
last season on the sophomore team and have suffered only one loss in two years. 
The group is headed by the strong-armed Walsh, who was good enough to replace 
returning quarterback Paul Myro, and receiver-safety Ryan Berry, the younger 
brother of former West All-CIF receiver Sean Berry. 
</P>
<P>
The junior class also boasts a pair of hefty linemen: 6-3, 265-pound Scott 
Werner and 6-7, 270-pound John Subers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a cycle," Black said. "It's coming back in our favor." 
</P>
<P>
One of the keys to West's fine showing last weekend was the play of its "Korean 
Connection." 
</P>
<P>
That's the nickname the Warriors have given to senior wide receiver James Kim, 
senior inside linebacker Jae Kim and junior David Kim, none of whom are 
related. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest surprise of the boys basketball tournament in the 
Grid-Hoops Festival was the second-place finish by Narbonne. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos, who were 3-18 last season, reeled off victories over Burroughs of 
Burbank, Verbum Dei, Torrance and Banning before losing to Compton, 55-41, in 
the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne's Gabe Maciel and Major Goulsey were named to the all-tournament team 
along with Torrance guard Rick Robison and Banning's Daniel Johnson and Jabari 
Anderson. Curtis Thomas of Compton was chosen MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes was festival runner-up in the girls basketball tournament and 
defending state Division I champion Morningside, playing without its two best 
players, finished third. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale defeated Palos Verdes, 30-18, in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Monique Morehouse and Susan Willhite of Palos Verdes were named to the 
all-tournament squad, as were Denisha Carnell and Sherielle Young of 
Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Monarchs played without state Player of the Year Lisa Leslie and 
All-CIF sophomore Janet Davis. Both had other commitments. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Doug Mitchell, basketball coach at South Torrance High for the 
last two years, has been named to the same position at Bishop Montgomery. 
Mitchell replaces Tony Carter, who resigned after one season . . . Quarterback 
Perry Klein, who helped Carson to the L.A. City 4-A football title last year, 
has been added to the South team for the Shrine All-Star Classic on July 29 at 
the Rose Bowl. The move gives the South four quarterbacks: Klein, Curtis Conway 
of Hawthorne, David Henigan of Fountain Valley and Ron Redell of Crespi . . . 
Conway, the state 100-meter champion, will compete in the high school 100 at 
the Jack in the Box Invitational track meet Aug. 6 at UCLA. Also entered in the 
100 is Hawthorne senior Chris Alexander, who placed fifth in the state meet.

PRIVATE LIVES: DOUGLAS CRAMER'S GETAWAY LIFE ON THE FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jeannine Stein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Douglas S. Cramer's name is associated with the somewhat polar worlds of 
television and art. The producer of such shows as "Love Boat," "Dynasty" and 
"Hotel" is also an avid art collector, amassing through the years an extensive 
contemporary art collection. One of his favorite getaways is his ranch in Los 
Olivos in the Santa Ynez Valley that is home to horses, a herd of sheep, 
vineyards and several galleries filled with art. On Saturday, Cramer hosts his 
Barn Dance for 150 friends at the ranch, an annual event that has grown into a 
weekend of get-togethers with out-of-town guests. Here Cramer talks to Jeannine 
Stein about the joys of the not-always-so-simple life down on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"I built the ranch as a retreat from Beverly Hills. I bought the land in 1980, 
and it was also around the time that I realized both of my children knew very 
little about life outside of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been fascinated with vineyards. I heard about the Santa Ynez 
Valley from Richard and Esther Shapiro (the creators and co-executive producers 
of "Dynasty"). One day I went up with my business manager and we saw some 
property, right next door in fact to (producer) Ray Stark, whom I've known for 
years. Bo and John Derek lived about a mile away. Ray said this was one of the 
greatest places in the world, but he said if I bought I'd have to promise not 
to tell anyone about it. He didn't want a rush of people up there. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought a parcel of 60-some-odd acres, and I commissioned an architect to do 
three cottages on the hillside, one for the kids, one for me and one that would 
hold the living room, dining room and kitchen. Well, in the process of a year's 
work we combined the three houses into one. In the early '80s I was feverishly 
into collecting contemporary art and I needed more and more wall space. 
Eventually we built eight or nine galleries that hold the art. 
</P>
<P>
"A long-term goal I had was having a winery of my own, and combining the arts 
with the winery. Throughout the '80s I kept adding land, now I'm about up to 
400 acres, and we grow grapes, primarily for Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and 
Riesling. I bought into a partnership in the Byron winery that was just getting 
started in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"We have horses here, and we've gotten into raising sheep; we have about 600 
right now, eight or nine different kinds. I love animals, I've always loved 
them. I have three dogs that go everywhere with me. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually fly up there on a Friday afternoon and come back Sunday night or 
Monday morning. I've not yet managed to spend an entire week there, but I would 
love to. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm there I wear jeans or shorts, and I don't think I've ever had a tie 
on. By the middle of the summer we're eating everything out our garden: spices, 
corn, zucchini, squash, tomatoes, peppers, pumpkins, carrots, celery. We'll run 
movies in the evening but we seldom go into town. 
</P>
<P>
"I do take work up with me -- unfortunately in my business you can't escape 
from it. A fax machine is my one holdout but life is forcing me to get one. The 
phones alone have grown from six to 28, scattered around the house. 
</P>
<P>
"Really the only wholesale invasion of people is the annual barn dance. This 
year will be the fourth one, and it's grown from from about 60 people to 150. 
We have people like (millionaire businessman) Marvin Davis and (novelist) 
Jackie Collins out there kicking up their heels. 
</P>
<P>
"Has Ray Stark's nightmare about people moving up here come true? I'm afraid it 
has. But it seems to be working well for me. My vision is that in another 10 
years the Santa Ynez ranch will be my basic residence, and I'll keep some 
pied-a-terre in Los Angeles, as I do in New York. But it really won't be that 
different from L.A. because all my neighbors here will be up there by then 
anyway."

BEACHES; 
</P>
<P>
EACH SUMMER, VALLEY TEENS HEAD WEST TO STAKE THEIR CLAIM AT ZUMA AND MALIBU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beach bums Kelvin Soltani and Logan MacPherson never stop searching for the 
perfect one-liner to meet girls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy," said MacPherson, 20. "Just go up to them and say, 'So what part of 
the Valley are you from?' You got them right there." 
</P>
<P>
These two best friends from Burbank speak from experience, nestled in their 
familiar tanning spot on Zuma Beach between lifeguard towers 6 and 7. "Ever 
since I can remember," said Soltani, 19, "this has been the place where Valley 
people meet -- just see each other between 6 and 7." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, hundreds of San Fernando Valley residents basked in the sunshine 
nearby, squeezed together as if the rest of the beach were off limits. They 
know their territory -- Zuma, Topanga State Beach, Paradise Cove, Cross Creek 
-- and they know the rules: frozen yogurt comes from Penguins, lunch means 
chips and colas, and one-piece bathing suits are something someone wears 
somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Zuma, with its smooth sand, convenient parking, high-rolling waves and abundant 
offerings of the opposite sex, stands alone in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Zuma," MacPherson said simply. 
</P>
<P>
MacPherson and Soltani, who will both attend UC Berkeley in the fall, are 
majoring in tanning over the summer. By 10 a.m. almost every day, they're 
already parked in prime position to catch rays and catch glances at the daily 
parade of bikinis. Zuma is more than a beach to them; it's a drama. 
</P>
<P>
"Something is always happening here," Soltani said. "You should see this place 
when there's so many people you can't walk. The music will be blasting, and 
people will be launching water balloons. It's so entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
And they say it's free of the harassment that Valley visitors sometimes receive 
from so-called locals -- beach-goers from the Westside -- at other spots. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Wilson, 15, of Calabasas and her friend, Kristy Towers, 15, of Woodland 
Hills, often take the special summer bus down Topanga Canyon Boulevard to 
Pacific Coast Highway to spend the afternoon at Topanga State Beach. They say 
they also take a lot of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"We were waiting for the bus the other day when all these surfers starting 
yelling at us: 'Go back to the Valley,' " Wilson said. "They all hate us, I 
guess 'cause they think we're stealing their beach." 
</P>
<P>
The surfers at Topanga State Beach, for the most part, weren't anxious to 
defend their territory in print. Except for one, who preferred to remain 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're not going to surf here," said the surfer, "they don't belong here. 
Let them go to their malls." 
</P>
<P>
This attitude doesn't frighten anyone away. Wilson said many teen-agers hang 
out at Topanga because the bus -- it costs 20 cents each way -- conveniently 
drops them off a few hundred feet away, and they can't find rides to Zuma or 
Malibu. (The bus originates at Parkway Calabasas and Calabasas Road and ends up 
at Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway.) 
</P>
<P>
Wilson already considers herself an expert on the beach scene and was all too 
happy to lay out the ins and outs. Her first speech focused on food. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody gets large Cokes with ice," Wilson said. "You must know that. At 
Malibu, everyone runs out to the Jack-in-the-Box or the Pizza Hut. And Penguins 
is where everyone goes for frozen yogurt. Vanilla and coffee are favorites, 
unless they have peanut butter, and then it's gone real quickly. And everyone 
gets brownies on top." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the food options are limited. The hamburgers and hot dogs at nearby 
snack shops, according to beach-goers, don't exactly titillate the senses. And, 
besides, they don't do much for the teen-age budget. 
</P>
<P>
"The food is too expensive," Towers said. "If you spend a few dollars here 
every day, you'll have nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
So the alternative for many is to bring sandwiches, chips, fruit and purchase 
any other cheap items -- mostly soft drinks -- at a small market across Pacific 
Coast Highway. "We sell a lot of Cokes," said the market's owner, Ray Craig. 
"We like all those Valley kids coming down the hill." 
</P>
<P>
For her next discourse, Wilson chose shopping. Although she said it's fun to 
browse through stores near the beach, especially the "rad bikini" shops in 
Malibu, the only real merchandise up for grabs doesn't come with a definitive 
price tag. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys, of course," Wilson answered when questioned about the true purpose of 
beach browsing. "I'm here to get a tan, but if you're going to get a tan, why 
not have it be with guys too? We don't come here to meet people from school who 
we already know. We come here to meet new people." 
</P>
<P>
She saved her last speech for a roundup of area beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Topanga is really cool 'cause the sand is good and we have the bus," she 
said. "But then there's the sand in Malibu, which is so white and beautiful. 
And there are more cars in Malibu." 
</P>
<P>
So? 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, cars are great fun. You can watch and see the people in their 
convertibles," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sami Bahmanyar, 16, of Woodland Hills and Ann Lim, 15, were too busy watching 
guys on their surfboards to worry about cars. Hanging out at Topanga, they 
analyzed the art of boy and girl watching at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The classic move if guys want to talk to you is they ask for suntan lotion," 
Bahmanyar said. "Then they start talking to you, see you a few more times at 
the beach and you get to know them." 
</P>
<P>
Another popular move, said Julie Louis, 15, of Thousand Oaks, is "for guys to 
turn their blankets toward you and put their sunglasses on. They stare at you, 
and they think you don't know they're looking at you." 
</P>
<P>
At Zuma, David Kriz, 16, of Simi Valley, who called himself "Disco Dave," made 
a none-too-subtle pitch for Julie. On a recent afternoon, he even left a note 
on her towel that said: "You weren't here, so I wanted to say goodby and you 
looked nice. I'll call you tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Disco Dave did, and Julie said later that she got him off the phone as quickly 
as possible. She told him that she wouldn't be at the beach the next day 
because she was going to Magic Mountain. But she was at Zuma, and he saw her. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's mad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Only a little. Disco Dave said he'd try with her again and again until he 
succeeded -- just another Zuma subplot in the real-life daily soap under the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
Soltani and MacPherson make sure that they're stuck on the beach all summer. 
Happily unemployed, they spend every day at Zuma. Said Soltani: "It's not often 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Like so many others, they play people-watching games. A new social 
classification system has been set up among the regulars at Zuma: "posers," 
people who only go to the beach to be seen and really don't belong there; 
"trippers," people who seem to wander from one end of the beach to another 
handing out flyers or just looking aimless, and "outcasts," people who dress up 
in warm clothing and never take them off. 
</P>
<P>
"Between six and seven," MacPherson said, "anything can happen." 
</P>

WHERE TO PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each of the San Fernando Valley's four hockey leagues comes with its own set of 
rules, requirements and perks. 
</P>
<P>
Though all require helmets and heavy padding, the use of face masks and eye 
shields varies from league to league. 
</P>
<P>
The skill level also varies. The National Novice Hockey Assn. has traditionally 
been associated with beginners, whereas the Los Angeles County Hockey Assn. has 
a reputation for fielding more advanced players. But both leagues have moved 
into each other's territory. The NNHA now has Hockey America, an advanced 
league. The Los Angeles County Hockey Assn. started L.A. Novice last season for 
beginners. 
</P>
<P>
League fees, which do not include the cost of equipment, are from the 1988-89 
season. Most league officials said the fees will probably increase this year 
because of hikes in insurance rates and ice rink rates. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a guide to the four leagues. 
</P>
<P>
National Novice Hockey Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The NNHA was organized in 1980 in Washington and moved to the Los Angeles area 
in 1981. Local membership, including Hockey America, totaled 663 last season. 
The season runs from October through April. Beginners take part in eight 
training clinics and play eight games. Intermediate and advanced teams play 20 
games. All members must be 21 or older. The cost for membership for all teams 
was $284 last year, with a $25 registration fee. An additional $100 was charged 
for team jerseys and socks. 
</P>
<P>
Health insurance is required. Beginners and intermediate players are required 
to wear face masks. Games are played at the Ice Capades Chalet in North 
Hollywood, the Pickwick Ice Arena in Burbank, the Pasadena Ice Skating Center 
and the Culver City Ice Arena. For information, call (800) 446-2539. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Hockey Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The association was organized in 1983. Membership, including L.A. Novice, 
totaled about 500 last season. The season runs from October through April. 
Beginners take part in four training clinics and play 20 games. Checking and 
senior non-checking teams play 25 games. The age requirement is 19 for beginner 
teams and advanced checking teams, and 25 for senior non-checking teams. Last 
year, beginners paid $325; others paid $310. There was a $15 registration fee. 
The teams are required to purchase their own jerseys, although the association 
helps teams find sponsors to help cover the cost. Health insurance is not 
required. Only beginners are required to wear eye shields. Games are played at 
the Pickwick Ice Arena in Burbank, the Pasadena Ice Skating Center, the Ice 
Capades Chalet in North Hollywood, the Culver City Ice Arena, the Olympic Ice 
Arena in Harbor City and the Norwalk Ice Arena. For information call (818) 
894-1190. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Hockey Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The association was organized in 1969. Membership is restricted to about 120, 
at least 18 years old, for eight teams, and replacements are chosen from those 
who play local pickup games. All teams play in one division. Face masks and eye 
shields are not required. The 22-game season runs from October through May. The 
cost last season was $360, including jerseys and an end-of-the-season banquet. 
There is no registration fee. Health insurance is not required. All games are 
played at the Ice Capades Chalet in North Hollywood. For information call (818) 
769-1600. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley Adult Hockey Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The association was organized in 1987. Last season, the membership totaled 
about 300 players. The age requirement is 18. The season runs from October 
through April. Teams can opt to play four or five games a month. Members are 
charged a monthly fee; last season it ranged from $60 to $65. Members are 
responsible for purchasing their own team jerseys. Teams are divided into four 
divisions, from beginner to advanced. Only beginners are required to wear eye 
shields. All games are played at the Conejo Valley Ice Skating Center in 
Newbury Park. For information call (805) 498-6671.

ICE HOCKEY, THE NEW SPORT OF WOULD-BE KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MACAK, Macak is a Studio City free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Robinson and another hockey player were perched on the edge of the 
Burbank ice rink, ready to replace members on their team's offense. The other 
player turned to Robinson and said, "You know, you're always falling down on 
the ice." 
</P>
<P>
It was a friendly jab and Robinson, laughing it off as the two jumped down and 
skated toward their positions, shouted, "Hey, if I can't get to the puck by 
skating to it, I'll dive at it!" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Robinson, 35, of Studio City, had a pretty good game. His team lost 
12-0, but he didn't fall very often. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Backward, Head First' 
</P>
<P>
"The game before, I really hurt myself. I went right off my heels and landed 
backward, head first," he said. "When you're 18 and that happens, you want to 
know if you hurt anything. But when you're 35, you want to know if you're still 
alive." Robinson said he staggered up as quickly as he could and continued 
playing. "You don't want anyone to know it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Amateur ice hockey for beginners such as Robinson is booming in the San 
Fernando Valley. Despite the bumps and bruises, the odd hours of the games and 
the sport's high cost, enthusiasm for it is running high, and Robinson is one 
its boosters. "I lost 35 pounds in the first three months," he said. "The 
weight just fell off. Ice hockey will get you in better shape than anything but 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Los Angeles County Hockey Assn. created a beginner division 
for those who have never skated before. At the end of the season, it had 12 
beginner teams with about 190 players, boosting the association's membership to 
more than 500. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Berman, president of the association, says amateur ice hockey is booming 
in Los Angeles because professional hockey is booming here. He attributes much 
of this to Wayne Gretzky's highly publicized first season with the Los Angeles 
Kings. "Ice hockey has become the thing to watch and do," Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
The association's major competitor for players and ice time is the National 
Novice Hockey Assn. The NNHA, which has focused on beginners since it came to 
the Valley in 1981, has also felt the boom. Last season, the number of NNHA 
beginner and intermediate teams jumped from 25 to 31. The rosters for both the 
Los Angeles County Hockey Assn. and the NNHA has swelled to the point that the 
leagues had to limit membership in their summer programs. They report waiting 
lists of from 50 to 80 men and women. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the Valley area, the boom is also evident. Five independent 
teams at the Conejo Valley Ice Skating Rink in Newbury Park were organized into 
the Conejo Valley Adult Hockey Assn. in 1987. Last season, the association 
fielded 19 teams in four divisions, from beginner to advanced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sport Can Be Costly 
</P>
<P>
This growth in amateur ice hockey is happening despite increasing costs of 
playing and decreasing amounts of available ice time. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to equipment, which costs a new player several hundred dollars, 
rates for insurance and ice rinks are going up. Gino Vella, president of the 
California Amateur Hockey Assn., said hockey leagues were charged $83 a team 
last season for liability insurance and CAHA dues. This year, the amount will 
be $250. This, Vella said, will probably be passed on in league fees to 
players. League fees averaged $300 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Another hurdle is the dwindling number of ice rinks in the Los Angeles area. 
Rinks were closed at Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park in 1984 and Brea Mall in 1987 
as the malls were remodeled and expanded. Hockey players fear that a similar 
fate for the Ice Capades Chalet at Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood when the 
lease expires in two years. May Centers in St. Louis, Mo., is planning to 
expand the mall with Forest City Inc. Joan Kradin, a spokeswoman for Forest 
City, said the future of the rink is still under study. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Practice After Midnight 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' four leagues compete for ice time at seven remaining rinks. 
Because of the growing number of teams, games are often scheduled to run past 
midnight on weekdays. League officials say that may be the norm in a few years, 
with practice sessions running even later. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Thicke, star of the sitcom "Growing Pains" and a Toluca Lake resident, has 
been playing hockey in the Valley since 1971. He's pleased that the sport has 
caught on but laments that there's less ice time. "You go for a pickup game and 
instead of 12 guys playing each other for an hour, there are 30 guys, and maybe 
eight won't get to play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And more keep signing up. Berman said the Los Angeles County Hockey Assn. could 
have as many as 20 beginner teams this fall if he can come up with additional 
ice time. 
</P>
<P>
Berman, a 30-year-old Los Angeles police officer and a Simi Valley resident, 
founded the association in 1983, with one team organized among Police 
Department members and another team associated with Phillips Hockey Shop in 
Glendale. In addition to police, those playing league games include 
white-collar professionals, factory workers, gays, women and well-known 
performers such as Thicke, Michael J. Fox and Michael Keaton. Berman said 
blacks and Latinos have yet to embrace the sport. The association had only one 
black player and three Latinos last season. 
</P>
<P>
Berman and NNHA officials report that new recruits for both leagues are mostly 
white-collar professionals. David Robinson's NNHA summer team is a good 
example. Although Robinson, a nightclub performer, stand-up comic, actor and 
host for female mud-wrestling bouts, may not qualify as a yuppie, he said most 
of his 15 teammates do. They include a purchasing director, a law student, a 
real estate developer and a woman who manages a data processing center. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Goodman at NNHA's Washington office said the median age for the league's 
12,000 members nationwide is 31 and the median income $35,000. "So, yes, it's a 
fair assessment to say that we're attracting yuppies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is because of the cost, said Larry Bruyere, manager of Phillips Hockey 
Shop and vice president of the Los Angeles County Hockey Assn. "With most 
sports, all you need is a mitt or a pair of shoes. For ice hockey, you need 
$300 to $400 worth of equipment." He said that on top of this are league fees, 
rink fees for practice sessions and the cost of team jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not cheap to play," agreed Neil Kantor, 30, a real estate developer and 
captain of Robinson's team, who estimates that he spent $1,500 on the sport 
since he began skating only a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women Members Increase 
</P>
<P>
Goodman said women are showing a growing interest in ice hockey, although they 
accounted for only 5% of his league's membership last year. Locally, the NNHA 
and the Los Angeles County Hockey Assn. each reported half a dozen women 
members. The Valley Hockey Assn., the smallest of Los Angeles' four leagues, 
had two women, and the Conejo Valley Hockey Assn. had three. Coordinator Nancy 
Chenchick said the Conejo Valley group is trying to organize an all-woman team 
for the upcoming season, however.

<P>
Women who play amateur hockey are among the sport's most ardent proponents, but 
they admit that they often have to prove themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Marsden, 23, of Chatsworth is captain of the NNHA's Green Hornets, a 
team organized two seasons ago. Marsden talks at length about the support she 
receives from her own team members, but said she still takes "a few bad shots" 
from opponents. "Some of the guys are very defensive, like you're not supposed 
to be playing their sport." 
</P>
<P>
Marsden, who weighs 120 pounds and is 5 feet, 2 inches tall, said one 
tournament opponent pinned her in a corner and kept punching her. She 
retaliated by swinging her stick like a bat, giving the surprised player a 
wallop. "I wasn't penalized; the ref didn't see it," she said. Despite these 
skirmishes, Marsden insists that the sport is fun. "And the more I play, the 
more fun it gets." 
</P>
<P>
Last season there was also a gay team. The Blades was one of the first teams to 
organize with L.A. Novice, the beginner league associated with the Los Angeles 
County Hockey Assn. The team includes gay men, lesbians "and a few token 
straights," according to Blades member David Knepprath, 32, a self-employed 
screen printer. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it's still a macho sport, and I thought we'd be testing the waters a 
bit," Knepprath said. "But the reception has been quite good. The other teams 
understand we're here to play hockey, and we play competitively." 
</P>
<P>
Berman said one member of the league was expelled for abusive language against 
the gay team. Other than that, he said, he knows of no trouble involving women 
and gays in amateur hockey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Image Has Changed 
</P>
<P>
Thicke believes that the changed public image of ice hockey has a lot to do 
with its growth as an amateur sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, the perception was, this was roller derby on ice," Thicke said, 
adding that there was justification for that view. "Early enthusiasts were 
playing the mayhem-goon style of hockey. A fight would start out, and I'd say, 
'What's the matter with you guys, are you crazy?' And they'd say, 'This is what 
it's all about.' " 
</P>
<P>
Thicke, who grew up playing the game in northern Ontario, said players have 
developed an appreciation for the finer points of the game. "They're no longer 
there to get their male hormonal aggression out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman and Berman said their leagues have very strict rules for conduct. "You 
fight, you're out of the league," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Checking, when a player uses his body to bump an opponent away from the puck 
and, on occasion, slam the opponent into the boards, is an integral part of 
professional ice hockey. But it's not permitted in amateur teams except for the 
Los Angeles County Hockey Assn.'s most advanced division. Still, a fair amount 
of tripping, elbowing and shoving was evident at recent games among 
non-checking teams at the Pickwick Ice Center in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"There is contact in this sport," said Jeff Mills, captain and coach for the 
Rebels, one of the non-checking teams. "But these guys have to go to work the 
next day, so they're not here to get themselves injured." 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels recently played and lost to the Culver City Stars. Two of Mills' 
players ended up in the penalty box during the game. "It was for minor 
offenses, tripping and hooking," Mills said. "The guys get tired on their 
shifts near the end of the game, and they start to reach a little more and trip 
up the other players." 
</P>
<P>
Mills, 32, of Granada Hills, operations manager for a beverage company in 
Burbank, was 10 years old when he played his first hockey game at the ice rink 
in Burbank. He continued with the sport through boarding school in Connecticut 
and college in northern Illinois and had several tryouts with pro and Olympic 
teams before hanging up his skates. "About a year ago, some guys talked me into 
playing again. So I'm just out here for fun now. This is a good bunch of guys," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Hockey Assn. was initially organized for those like 
Mills, who played hockey for years, and for others like Thicke, who grew up 
with the sport in the East, Midwest or Canada. But growth in the sport is with 
beginners, league officials report, not veterans. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles County Hockey Assn., the number of checking and senior 
non-checking teams has not increased. The membership in Hockey America, the 
advanced-league association with the NNHA, actually decreased last season, from 
204 in 1987-88 to 136 in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Echeverrie, Hockey America's Los Angeles administrator, blamed the drop on 
personnel changes in the local office and a bid by other leagues to woo members 
away. He predicted that the number of members will increase again at the start 
of the new season. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the boom involves beginners such as Sue Allen, 28, a computer 
programmer, who grew up in Woodland Hills with no experience at hockey or any 
other contact sport. Two years ago, a friend coaxed her to give hockey a try. 
"I was afraid of doing things that could get me hurt. So this was more of a 
challenge, like conquering an old fear," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, while playing in the summer league, Allen met and began to date 
teammate Boni Bigornia, a 28-year-old engineer from Canada. They played on 
separate teams in the winter season, and the two teams met for a final match 
April 4 -- as did Allen and Bigornia. 
</P>
<P>
During the pregame warm-up, Bigornia skated to the center of the rink, called 
Allen over and offered her a ring and a wedding proposal. "Of course, we were 
hugging and kissing at that point. My teammates were skating up to us, laughing 
and calling out: 'What are you doing? He's on the other side!' " Bigornia's 
proposal won her over, but Allen reported that her team won the match, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
The boom also involves players like Robinson, the nightclub comic, who played a 
few games while growing up in Boston but never considered playing in Los 
Angeles until friends on an NNHA team urged him to join. "They needed a 
goalie," he said. "Since I'd be joining a beginner team, I thought I should at 
least be able to compete. But even though must of these guys had only been 
skating seven or eight weeks, everyone could out-skate me. When the season 
started, I was by far the worst goalie in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he worked at the sport and takes pride in his growth as a player. 
This summer, Robinson, needing a change of pace, is serving as a left wing, but 
looks forward to returning as goalie for the winter season. "I like the idea of 
being the last stop before the puck goes into the net." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Robinson's team met for its sixth summer game after losing 
12-0 the previous week. They lost again, 7-0.

DEFENSIVE LAPSE BY DANIELS SPARKS CUBS' 4-0 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
About that trade . . . 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels, expected to ignite the Dodgers' offense, instead provided a 
defensive lapse Wednesday night in his debut. 
</P>
<P>
The newest Dodger, acquired Tuesday along with Lenny Harris in a trade that 
sent pitcher Tim Leary and utility infielder Mariano Duncan to the Cincinnati 
Reds, misplayed a first-inning blooper into a double, sending the Chicago Cubs 
on their way to a 4-0 victory before 40,050 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
As for offensive sparks, the Dodgers provided none. Daniels, who sliced a 
ground-rule double into the seats along the third base line in the second 
inning, was the only Dodger to reach second base. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bielecki, perhaps best known to trivia buffs as the Cubs' starting pitcher 
last Aug. 9 in the first official night game at Wrigley Field, joined a much 
less select group by holding the Dodgers scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
Bielecki, who gave up only three hits and allowed only four Dodgers to reach 
base, is the 12th pitcher to shut out the Dodgers this season. 
</P>
<P>
He credited the Cubs with playing an outstanding game. 
</P>
<P>
"I just played a small part in it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A small part? 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old right-hander walked one and struck out six while improving to 
9-5 with his second career shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Bielecki said it probably was his best outing of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw a shutout earlier in the year in San Diego," he said of a 4-0 victory 
over the Padres on May 4, "but I had to get out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, I got the first out in every inning." 
</P>
<P>
The punchless Dodgers provided only token resistance. 
</P>
<P>
The loss went to Mike Morgan, who had been 3-0 against the Cubs but was unable 
to prevent the Dodgers from falling a season-worst 14 games behind the 
division-leading San Francisco Giants in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who will start a 12-game trip with a doubleheader against the 
Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday night, are only two games ahead of the last-place 
Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Nine Cubs batted in the first inning, including Jerome Walton, who led off with 
a single through the left side. After moving to second on a wild pitch, Walton 
scored on a single through the middle by the No. 2 batter, Ryne Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
Next came Daniels' misadventure in left field. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels broke the wrong way on a blooper by Mitch Webster, then was unable to 
make a diving catch after a long sprint. The ball kicked off Daniels' glove and 
bounced away, resulting in a double for Webster. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's double put runners at second and third, and a groundout by Mark Grace 
then scored Sandberg and moved Webster to third. 
</P>
<P>
Webster scored on a squeeze bunt by Damon Berryhill, giving the Cubs a 3-0 lead 
after the game was only about 10 minutes old. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs then loaded the bases, getting a walk from Lloyd McClendon and a 
double into the right-field corner from Vance Law, who later added a triple and 
a single, before Shawon Dunston was intentionally walked. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan (6-10) escaped further damage by retiring Bielecki on a grounder, but he 
ran into trouble again in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg reached first on a one-out throwing error by shortstop Alfredo Griffin 
and, one out later, stole second. A single through the left side by Grace 
scored Sandberg, increasing the Cubs' lead to 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, who lasted only three innings last Friday night in a 7-2 loss to the 
St. Louis Cardinals, was lifted in the fifth for a pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
John Shelby, who batted for him, looked at a called third strike, faring no 
better than any of the other Dodger batters. 
</P>
<P>
Shelby, in fact, fared worse. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, the Dodgers' opening-day starter in center field accepted a 
demotion to the Dodgers' triple-A affiliate at Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
John Shelby's place on the roster will be taken by Jeff Fisher, a right-handed 
pitcher who was recalled from Albuquerque. . . . Utility infielder Lenny 
Harris, acquired by the Dodgers Tuesday along with Kal Daniels in a trade with 
the Cincinnati Reds, said that he was "kind of happy" about the deal, but said 
the Reds gave up on him too early, "like they did with Jeff Treadway," who was 
sold to the Atlanta Braves last spring. . . . Daniels, asked about his 
potential as a base-stealer: "I'm not going to put a number on it. I just know 
I'm capable of stealing a lot of bases. I'm not going to say I'm going to steal 
50 bases and have you guys say, 'Hey, he said he was going to steal 50 bases 
and he stole 12.' I'm not going to put myself in a hole." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels wore No. 28, formerly worn by Pedro Guerrero. . . . The Dodgers are the 
only team in the major leagues without a batter with 10 or more home runs. . . 
. The Dodgers open a 12-game trip with a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates Friday night. It's the start of a six-game series against the Pirates 
that will also include a doubleheader Sunday. . . . A fourth-inning single 
extended Mike Marshall's hitting streak to 10 games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda, on the demotion of Shelby, who batted .156 with one home 
run and seven runs batted in: "This is what he needs. He needs to play. He's 
got himself in a rut, and the only way he can get out of it is to play. He's 
played a tremendous center field for us over the last two years, but he's run 
into tough times." . . . Said Mike Morgan: "I've struggled my last couple of 
starts. You expect to lose those. Unfortunately, I've lost my good starts, too. 
Maybe I'll get lucky one of these days and give up four runs and win a game."

LALPE DHUEZ, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the favored Frenchman, Laurent Fignon, wins the Tour de France, he will be 
able to look back on the final 2 1/2 miles of the excruciating climb up l'Alpe 
d'Huez Wednesday as the test of his endurance and courage that separated him 
from his challengers, most notably American Greg LeMond. 
</P>
<P>
Known as "le puncheur" because of his ability to put away opponents when it 
appears as if he is destined to defeat, Fignon, a two-time champion, attacked 
near the end of the tour's most demanding stage, leaving the struggling LeMond 
behind and reclaiming the leader's yellow jersey with only four days remaining 
in the 21-stage, 2,030-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, I felt as if I had wings," Fignon said. 
</P>
<P>
Behind by 53 seconds when the 100.4-mile, 17th stage began at Briancon, Fignon, 
28, has a 26-second lead over the second-place LeMond, who was unable to 
respond when the Frenchman found the reserve to pull away on one of the tour's 
most challenging climbs. 
</P>
<P>
"My legs began to feel like lead near the end," said LeMond, 28, who in 1986 
became the only American to win the cycling's most prestigious race. "I can't 
describe the pain I had to go through at the end. I was beyond my limits." 
</P>
<P>
But victory is still within his grasp. If Fignon does not extend his lead 
significantly during the next three stages, LeMond is capable of catching him 
in the final stage, a 15.2-mile time trial Sunday from Versailles to Paris. It 
would be the first time since 1968 that the champion has been determined on the 
final day. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond said last Sunday that the ideal situation for him would be to trail 
Fignon by about 15 seconds entering the final time trial. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what occurs between now and then, this already will be remembered as 
one of the the most exciting of the 76 tours. That is due in large part to 
LeMond, who was not expected to be a factor after missing much of the last two 
years with various injuries. He was near death in March of 1987 from a gunshot 
wound suffered in a hunting accident. 
</P>
<P>
But LeMond has earned the yellow jersey twice this year, most recently last 
Sunday when he reeled in Fignon during a time trial as the cyclists entered the 
Alps and carried a 40-second lead into the tour's final week. He extended the 
lead to 53 seconds over Fignon Tuesday, although the American admitted 
afterward that he was fatigued and expressed concern about the next stage. 
</P>
<P>
Of the six most difficult climbs on the tour, three of them faced the cyclists 
Wednesday. The worst was saved for last, 8.3 miles almost straight up the 
formidable l'Alpe d'Huez. 
</P>
<P>
Gert-Jan Theunisse of the Netherlands won the stage in 5 hours 10 minutes 39 
seconds. But that was inconsequential as the three leaders, LeMond, Fignon and 
defending champion Pedro Delgado of Spain, waged their own race. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado began the day in fourth place, 2:48 behind LeMond. As the best hill 
climber among the three leaders, Delgado was expected to make his move. But 
with only 2 1/2 miles remaining on l'Alpe d'Huez, he was still in a pack with 
LeMond and Fignon. They left France's Charly Mottet, who was in third place 
after Tuesday, behind at the foot of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
That was the point of Fignon's ambush as he left LeMond and Delgado far behind. 
Delgado finally went after Fignon, catching him about one mile later. But 
LeMond was spent at the end of a punishing day in blistering heat. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado finished second in the stage, but his time was the same as Fignon's, 
1:09 behind Theunisse. LeMond finished fourth, another 1:19 behind. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw LeMond's shoulder go down, and he didn't react when I went away," Fignon 
said. "Delgado had to make a big effort to catch me, and he couldn't attack. I 
didn't want to lose a single second to Delgado, and I achieved it." 
</P>
<P>
Delgado moved into third place overall ahead of Mottet, but the Spaniard is 
1:55 behind Fignon and may find it difficult to make up time with the most 
difficult of the Alpine stages behind him. The cyclists will remain in the Alps 
for the next two stages, but neither is nearly so demanding as the one 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised by Fignon's attack," Delgado said. "It will be difficult to 
win the tour now, but I don't want to give up. I will try something in the next 
two days. Anyone can have a bad day, after all." 
</P>
<P>
With about 250,000 people crowding the slopes on the final hill, Fignon 
recaptured the yellow jersey on its 70th anniversary. On July 19, 1919, Henri 
Desgrange, who founded the tour, decided to show off the leader by putting him 
in a distinctive color. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Fignon can keep the yellow jersey may not be determined for another 
four days. 
</P>
<P>
"We always say that the rider who wears the yellow jersey at l'Alpe d'Huez wins 
the tour," he said. "I hope it's true this time, but the race is not over yet." 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Longo of France moved steadily away from the field, scoring another 
convincing stage victory in the women's Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive day, Longo won easily, winning the 50-mile seventh 
stage from Briancon to St. Jean-de Maurienne in the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Canins of Italy, like Longo a two-time champion, was second, 1:33 behind. 
She trails Longo in the overall standings by 7:04. American Inga Thompson took 
22nd in the stage but stayed third overall as she was in a group that finished 
2:52 behind.

BIGGEST MONEY COULD BE AHEAD FOR TYSON; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE LACK OF ENDORSEMENTS, BOXER COULD MAKE $100 MILLION IN HBO DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One spring night in 1987, Mike Tyson's co-manager, Jim Jacobs, was in a Las 
Vegas hotel room discussing the young boxing champion's future before an 
upcoming bout against James (Bonecrusher) Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, 20, had recently become history's youngest heavyweight champion, and no 
one then could imagine anything but a golden future him. Already he was 
commanding up to $2 million per fight but was, Jacobs said then, on his way to 
endorsement riches no other athlete had approached. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike will, if he continues as he has, make more money than any athlete in the 
history of this country," Jacobs boasted that night. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson went on to defeat Smith in a decision, and is en route to fulfilling 
Jacobs' prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not the way Jacobs, who died of pneumonia in March of 1988, 
envisioned it. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who has suffered through a well-publicized divorce from actress Robin 
Givens and unflattering characterizations of his personal life, is no longer 
the fresh-faced, glib, happy-looking athlete from the days of 1987 and 1988. 
Today, you rarely see the gold-toothed smile. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps also lost are long-term, potentially multimillion dollar deals that 
might have bumped Tyson's endorsement earnings to tens of millions of dollars 
per year, some close to the situation say. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Tyson earned about $35 million in boxing purses and made millions more 
in endorsement deals with Pepsi, Eastman Kodak and Nintendo, a video game 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's deal with Diet Pepsi was a three-month deal that ended about two weeks 
after the (Michael) Spinks fight," a former Tyson aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, he was going to sign a one-year Pepsi deal that could have earned 
him about $10 million. It was a huge deal. Then, just before the Spinks fight, 
the stuff came out about Mike hitting Robin and that was the end of Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
"In a very short time, all the endorsement deals were dead." 
</P>
<P>
They still are. But as Tyson prepares this week to fight Carl (The Truth) 
Williams Friday, one of the side topics has been the opening of negotiations 
between Home Box Office and the two factions that manage Tyson for a lifetime 
deal with the champion. Presently, there are three fights left -- including 
Friday's -- on HBO's seven-fight, $26.5-million contract with Tyson. The 
duration of the deal would be for the remainder of Tyson's boxing career. The 
figure discussed is $100 million, should Tyson continue to win for another 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But gone are the deals with Fortune 500 corporations in the aftermath of 
Tyson's personal problems: accounts of Tyson throwing furniture at Givens and 
her mother, taking swings at Givens, screaming obscenities from the roof of his 
home, early morning street fights, and Tyson turning his back on old friends 
such as Steve Lott. 
</P>
<P>
Lott, who worked for Jacobs, took Tyson into his apartment and looked after him 
when he was an up-and-coming prospect, known to no one outside New York boxing 
circles. 
</P>
<P>
When Givens told Tyson to fire Lott, Tyson told his ex-trainer, Kevin Rooney to 
do it. Rooney refused, and also was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Because New York newspapers reported the circumstances in considerable detail, 
Team Tyson's image gradually eroded. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Tyson told Philadelphia Daily News columnist Stan Hochman: "I don't 
like the fight game anymore. I don't like this business anymore." 
</P>
<P>
He has recently criticized another ex-friend, former light-heavyweight champion 
Jose Torres, for writing about Tyson's alleged sexual preferences in his book, 
"Fire and Fear." 
</P>
<P>
Another book, "Blood Season," by New York Times boxing writer Phil Berger, is a 
look at a young athlete often incapable of handling the spotlight of the 
heavyweight championship. Tyson is shown to be at times compassionate with 
still-remaining old friends, and to have an almost teary-eyed affection for pet 
pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
And the dark side: Screaming obscenities from the roof of his New Jersey 
mansion, on the night of a furniture-throwing, window-breaking rampage that 
terrorized his wife and mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion in his life is largely of his own doing, those who know him say. 
</P>
<P>
When Jacobs died, co-manager Bill Cayton became his manager. When Jacobs was 
alive, he ran the boxing end of the enterprise and was closer to Tyson. Cayton 
was the inside operator. With Jacobs gone, and forced to choose between Cayton 
and King's overtures, Tyson aligned himself with King. 
</P>
<P>
Cayton, however, has a manager's contract with Tyson that doesn't expire until 
February, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
And by joining forces with King -- who has no legal standing with Tyson -- the 
fighter has lost money. Because of the tug of war over Tyson, the fighter did 
not compete in matches Cayton had organized -- $10 million for a bout against 
Francesco Damiani in Italy and another $10 million to fight Adilson Rodrigues 
in Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
British promoters Jarvis Astair and Mickey Duff both said last February that by 
fighting Frank Bruno at the Las Vegas Hilton instead of London's Wembley 
Stadium -- as Cayton had set it up -- Tyson lost $3 million, not to mention 14 
first-class tickets on Concorde flights. 
</P>
<P>
So why did Tyson join forces with King? Without Tyson, King is out of the 
heavyweight business for the first time since Muhammad Ali was Cassius Clay. 
Had King allowed Tyson to fight Bruno in London, as Cayton had arranged, he 
would have been frozen out of the promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"King put a heavy race trip on Mike," said a source. "He told him he'd been 
manipulated by white people all his life. King is a great salesman, and he 
convinced Mike that Cayton was managing him poorly." 
</P>
<P>
King denies the assertion. At the height of the acrimony between the two, he 
called Cayton "Satan in disguise." Cayton and King have sued each other, 
although Cayton this week said: "Presently, we have peace. The lawyers are 
talking." 
</P>
<P>
Both men were at the head tables at Wednesday's news conference, with King, as 
always, serving as master of ceremonies. He introduced about 20 people, all but 
Cayton. "Mr. Steve Hyde (A Trump Plaza executive) will introduce this next 
young man later," King said, when he came to 70-year-old Cayton. 
</P>
<P>
The factions might resume their battle after Friday, however. 
</P>
<P>
If Tyson beats Williams -- he's a 12-1 favorite -- then a Tyson-Evander 
Holyfield match would seem to be in the offing, but King has been quiet about 
such an enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield already has a promoter, Dan Duva, who says that for this fight he 
might step aside and allow King to promote it -- providing he doesn't have to 
give up an option on Holyfield in the event he wins. If Tyson should lose to 
Holyfield, King would be out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be opposed to Mike fighting anyone but Evander Holyfield," Cayton said 
Wednesday. "But if that's what Mike wants I would not stand in his way, 
although as his legal manager I could prevent such a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Tyson-Holyfield is a big fight now and it will not get any bigger. In fact, it 
could disappear. One of them could lose a fight. One of them could get hit by a 
bus. Mike has an opportunity to make $20 million for that fight and it should 
be put together right now. I've always believed a $20-million fight in hand is 
better than 10 $20-million fights in the bush." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, midway through the news conference, while King talked, Tyson put 
his head on the table and pretended to fall asleep. He seemed eager to leave. 
King kept talking. Tyson yawned and stretched. King kept talking. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at 1:10 p.m., Tyson, seated next to the podium, rapped King on the arm 
with his elbow while he was in mid-sentence. No one could hear what he said, 
but the intention was clear. 
</P>
<P>
King finished talking in 30 seconds.

Tony Westlake rallied to defeat Del Ballard Jr., 249-214, Wednesday night to 
win the $130,000 El Paso Open, his second Professional Bowlers Assn. tournament 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake trailed by 17 pins after five frames, before unleashing six 
consecutive strikes to close out the match before Ballard rolled his final 
frame. Westlake, who collected $20,000, also got a big break in his comeback 
when Ballard left the difficult 7-10 split in the seventh frame and failed to 
convert it. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had a chance when he left that 7-10," Westlake said. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard, who is second to Mike Aulby on the PBA earnings list with $182,330, 
settled for second-place money of $10,500. 
</P>
<P>
To earn the right to meet Ballard, Westlake beat Dave Ferraro, 213-206. Like 
the championship game, Westlake rolled two strikes in the last frame to outlast 
Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to bowl against him. He's my best friend on tour. But, you're out 
here to make a living," Westlake said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro, who earned $7,000 for finishing third, won two matches before losing 
in the semifinal. To gain the semifinal, Ferraro eliminated Walter Ray Williams 
Jr., 215-203, and opened the stepladder finals by relegating Ron Williams to 
fifth place, 239-234. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth place was worth $5,500, while fifth received $4,500.

Dean allegedly left the scene after rear-ending a car driven by April Hammack, 
who followed Dean to a nearby traffic light and tried to talk with him. Dean 
said he was in a hurry and did not have time to talk, she told police.

Hammack followed Dean's car to LSU and told campus police, who said Dean

Light heavyweight Greg Townes, who was knocked out by Olympic gold medalist 
Andrew Maynard in a nationally televised fight last Saturday, may lose his 
license to fight in Rhode Island because he failed to disclose his criminal 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Townes, 24, who was convicted in 1984 of robbery and assault, said on his June 
26, 1988, application that he has no criminal record. A hearing has been 
scheduled on July 26 before the athletic commission. 
</P>

A commission spokesman said Townes' license could be suspended, but declined to

NEWSWIRE: HOWARD, FRESNO STATE FOOTBALL PLAYER, DIES OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fresno State football star Willie Howard Jr. died Wednesday of gunshot wounds 
suffered in a July 11 disturbance at an apartment in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, a 6-foot-3, 285-pound defensive end who earned All-Big West Conference 
honorable mention last season as a junior, was shot twice with a high-powered 
rifle when he and two other men allegedly forced their way into an apartment 
and accosted the occupant. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, 25, an ex-Marine who formerly played at Pasadena City College, was shot 
in the leg and back. The leg was amputated. 
</P>
<P>
The two men with Howard, Raymond Duran, 32, and Ralph Navarro, 26, were 
arrested Monday on charges of burglary and assault. Howard had been booked by 
proxy on the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
The occupant of the apartment, Robert Trevino, 27, said Duran was angry because 
Trevino had been dating Duran's estranged wife. Trevino said he fired at Howard 
in self defense. He has not been charged in the shooting.

WILFREDO GOMEZ SPURS COMEBACK BY SCORING A KNOCKOUT IN SECOND

Former three-time world champion Wilfredo Gomez of Puerto Rico overcame a 
sluggish first round to stop Mexican journeyman Mario Salazar in the second 
round of their lightweight bout Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, attempting to win a world title in his fourth weight class, was sent to 
the ropes early in the second round as Salazar tried to take advantage of 
Gomez's recent ring inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
But Gomez (44-3-1), who hadn't fought in a year, was able to counterpunch off 
the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
A short right floored Salazar (28-11) midway through the round and Gomez sent 
his opponent to the canvas twice more before the bout was stopped at 1:45 of 
the round. 
</P>
<P>
"I know my time away from the ring hurt me tonight," Gomez said. "At first, a 
few months ago I was weighing 180 pounds and had to lose more than 40 pounds to 
make the weight (139) tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez held the World Boxing Council super-bantamweight title from 1977 to 1983. 
He also held the WBC featherweight title and the World Boxing Assn. 
junior-lightweight championship, but was retired nearly two years before he 
returned last July. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez said he wants a title shot against WBA lightweight champion Edwin Rosario 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"To fight Rosario, I'm going to need to be in the best condition of my career," 
Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez was scheduled to fight Arturo Hernandez, but Hernandez pulled out because 
of a hand injury.

MAGICAL MILE SEEKS TO PROVE DEBUT WAS NO ILLUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Christine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Magical Mile was running in New York instead of at Hollywood Park, he might 
be described by now as the second coming of Devil's Bag, Easy Goer or even 
Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
New Yorkers go overboard on horses much more than Californians do. There might 
have been more written about Devil's Bag as a 2-year-old than there was about 
Secretariat in his entire career. Devil's Bag was scratched from the Kentucky 
Derby and never ran again. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer has gotten the same treatment during his brief career, which is why 
some Eastern journalists were so relieved when the colt redeemed himself by 
winning the Belmont after Sunday Silence beat him in both the Kentucky Derby 
and the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the tendency is to let the top horses establish themselves on 
the track before enshrining them in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Magical Mile has run only one time, and although he shattered Hollywood Park's 
track record by covering five furlongs in :56 2/5, all that's being said about 
trainer Warren Stute's colt so far is that he appears to be the best 2-year-old 
on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Magical Mile will run Saturday in the $100,000 Hollywood Juvenile at six 
furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye, who has never won the stake, has nevertheless ridden some 
outstanding 2-year-olds, including Roving Boy and Gato Del Sol. Delahoussaye 
won the Kentucky Derby back to back with Gato Del Sol and Sunny's Halo in 
1982-83. 
</P>
<P>
"This colt (Magical Mile) is one of the best 2-year-olds I've ever been on," 
Delahoussaye said. "Of course, you can't go by just one race, because you've 
got to wait and see if they can stretch out, but the potential with this one is 
there. For one thing, he's mature for a young horse. He's not that green. He 
reminds you of an older horse." 
</P>
<P>
Magical Mile suffered a minor leg cut in his debut and missed two weeks of 
training, then Stute couldn't find a race to use as a prep for the Juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be his first race in two months, and you have to be concerned about 
that," Delahoussaye said. "But he's been working good and I won't trade my 
chances with anybody. There'll be some other horses running Saturday who'll be 
in the same situation." 
</P>
<P>
There will be either a small field or a large group running in the $500,000 
Haskell Handicap at Monmouth Park a week from Saturday, depending on whether 
Easy Goer runs. Trainer Shug McGaughey is expected to make the decision on Easy 
Goer today, with the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga on Aug. 5 being his other 
option. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer and Sunday Silence were weighted at 126 pounds for the Haskell, but 
Sunday Silence is staying at Hollywood Park to run in the $400,000 Swaps on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious, winner of the Ohio Derby and beaten only once in his career, 
worked six furlongs at Monmouth Wednesday in a good 1:12 4/5. King Glorious has 
been assigned 123 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Another probable for the 1 1/8-mile Haskell is Music Merci at 120 pounds, but 
he would have to be flown to New Jersey from Los Angeles. It seems that the 
only definite starter besides King Glorious is Le Voyageur (114 pounds), the 
French-raced colt who made his American debut by leading the Belmont for a mile 
before finishing third, eighth lengths behind Easy Goer but only a length 
behind Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Only four horses -- Endow, Notorious Pleasure, Prized and Raise a Stanza -- are 
expected to challenge Sunday Silence in the Swaps. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker has won the Sunset Handicap 13 times, never with a distaffer, 
but he will get that chance Friday night at Hollywood Park when he rides No 
Review in the $250,000 race. In her last start, No Review finished third in the 
Beverly Hills Handicap for fillies and mares on July 2. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker, who will turn 58 on Aug. 19, is retiring early next year and will be 
honored Friday during a special evening program at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker rode in his first Sunset in 1949 and overall he has missed only four 
runnings of the stake since then. Besides the 13 victories, he has finished 
second four times and third three times. 
</P>
<P>
Seven horses are entered in the Sunset, including Frankly Perfect, who will be 
favored to give trainer Charlie Whittingham his 11th victory in the stake. Six 
of Whittingham's victories have come with Shoemaker in the saddle. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night's lineup, with jockeys and weights: 
</P>
<P>
Desert Crest, Chris McCarron, 114 pounds; Pranke, Pat Valenzuela, 117; Putting, 
Gary Stevens, 114; Frankly Perfect, Eddie Delahoussaye, 123; No Review, 
Shoemaker, 110; Pleasant Variety, Laffit Pincay, 114; and Miserden, Robbie 
Davis, 108. 
</P>
<P>
Present Value, the 5-year-old who won the Michigan Mile and One-Eighth at 49-1 
last Saturday at Detroit Race Course, could be the answer to a Shoemaker trivia 
question. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Shoemaker wins a stake during his farewell tour, which is scheduled to 
end at Santa Anita next Feb. 4, Present Value will be remembered as his last 
stake winner in the United States. Shoemaker rode Present Value to a 1 
1/4-length victory in the National Jockey Club Stakes on May 6 at Sportsman's 
Park, the first time he ever rode at the Chicago area track. 
</P>
<P>
With a price of $300,000, it was with some reluctance that trainer Ron McAnally 
approved the sale of Bayakoa, and now the Argentine mare has won five straight 
stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought $300,000 was too much," McAnally said, "but then I heard that they 
paid $500,000 for Rosadora, which made the price of our mare sound better." 
</P>
<P>
Rosadora finished fourth, far back of Bayakoa, in last Saturday's Vanity 
Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Rahy, winner of the Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park last Sunday, was the 
third highest-priced yearling to be auctioned in the country in 1986 when the 
son of Blushing Groom sold for $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever a horse flirts with Dr. Fager's record for the mile, as Rahy did when 
he won the Bel Air in 1:33 last Sunday, John Nerud reminds that Dr. Fager's 
1:32 1/5 came while carrying 134 pounds at Arlington Park in 1968. Rahy carried 
117 pounds in the Bel Air. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in 1968, Nerud brought Dr. Fager to Hollywood Park to run in the 
Californian. The trainer thought that the conditions of the race meant Dr. 
Fager would carry 127 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
An official from Hollywood Park met Nerud upon his arrival at LAX. "I've got 
good news and bad news," the trainer was told. "The good news is that the horse 
is doing fine; the bad news is that you'll really have to carry 130 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fager won the Californian by three lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park's season closes on Monday. . . . The Orange County Fair meeting 
for thoroughbreds and quarter horses opens next Tuesday night at Los Alamitos. 
It runs for 17 nights through Aug. 12. Post time for the first race is 6:45. . 
. . At the Del Mar meet that opens next Wednesday, Gary Stevens will try to 
become the first jockey to win three straight titles since Bill Shoemaker in 
1952-53-54. . . . If Wayne Lukas wins his third consecutive training title, he 
will join a Del Mar group that includes Willie Molter, Red McDaniel, Farrell 
Jones, Bobby Frankel and Mike Mitchell. . . . The owners of Super Diamond, the 
9-year-old gelding who earned $1.4 million and won the Hollywood Gold Cup and 
nine other stakes, are hoping to keep the horse in competition as a jumper.

WILDERNESS CAMP PROPOSED FOR VIOLENT TEENS

After another frenzied weekend of gang-related violence, Venice community 
leaders gathered Wednesday to hear one possible solution to what they consider 
the area's leading problem: 
</P>
<P>
If you can't remove the gang activity in the area, at least you can try to 
remove the gang leaders for a while. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big-City Youths 
</P>
<P>
That approach was pitched to more than 100 Venice activists, merchants, social 
service workers, city and county officials and police officers who packed the 
area's old City Hall building to hear a presentation from a nationwide 
organization that deals with the problems of big-city youths. 
</P>
<P>
Naomi Benghiat, a volunteer with the Los Angeles-based Youth at Risk group, 
outlined the organization's program, which raises money to send troubled 
teen-agers to a two-week wilderness camp, where they are taught to redirect 
their energy toward more successful endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic idea is to remove them from their destructive environment and talk 
about the obstacles that stop them from succeeding in their own lives," she 
said. "At the camp they are faced with a lot of physical challenges with the 
idea being that they will look at the challenges they must face in order to 
succeed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Youths Screened 
</P>
<P>
The program requires the community to raise the money, about $4,000 a person, 
for counseling services, meals and transportation to the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Local leaders, such as school officials and police officers, identify troubled 
youths who might benefit from the program. They are then screened by a 
committee. Benghiat said that the youths must participate in the program 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers then monitor the participants for a year, after they return from 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
Youth at Risk has run similar programs for up to 100 inner-city teen-agers in 
Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Oakland and South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hoffmann, president of the Venice Action Committee, said he organized the 
meeting because of the escalating gang and drug-dealing problems in the area. 
After listening to Benghiat's presentation, Hoffmann personally pledged enough 
money to sponsor one youth. 
</P>
<P>
"Venice is a difficult place to live and work; we've got a lot of problems," he 
said. "But if we could target the gangs and the violence, I think we could 
handle all the other problems easily. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could just target the minority of people that are causing a majority of 
problems, then I think we could really solve this. The cost is really small 
compared to what we've already been paying." 
</P>
<P>
However, Melvyn Hayward, an activist who works with gangs in Venice's Oakwood 
area, said that the $400,000 needed for the program would be better spent on 
organizations already in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working with nothing here," he said. "We can't even get money for 
recreation programs. We could use that money for something better. That program 
wouldn't change a thing. As soon as the camp was over, everything would be just 
like it was." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Bill Humphry, a detective in the Los Angeles Police Department's West 
Bureau anti-gang unit, Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums, said that 
one person was killed and nine others were injured in four separate 
gang-related shootings in Venice over the weekend. So far this year, he said, 
there have been three gang-related homicides in the area, but more than one 
dozen throughout the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ron Dina, who heads the CRASH program, said he supported the Youth at Risk 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great idea," he said. "Anything that would get these kids 
together and give them a common goal other than crime would be helpful. They 
just need to know that they can do something with themselves."

UNUSUAL COURSE COMBINES STUDY OF NATURE AND CREATIVE WRITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As the students hiked up into the Santa Monica Mountains toward Eagle Rock, 
they stopped to study the rocks, the clouds and a horned lizard, the size of a 
quarter, that could have starred in a movie called "Honey, I Shrunk the 
Stegosaurus." 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, a student dropped behind the rest of the group, pulled a 
journal from pocket or backpack and scribbled a paragraph or two. One student 
wrote a mini-essay about life and death, inspired by a patch of dead buckwheat. 
Another noted that the mountain trail was "as wide as a sparerib." 
</P>
<P>
The 16 students were taking an unusual interdisciplinary course being offered 
for the first time this summer by Santa Monica College. Called "Writing About 
Nature," the double-credit course is an introduction to physical geography and 
a beginning composition course. Co-taught by geographer Bill Selby and poet Jim 
Krusoe, it requires students to learn how to use both a sling psychrometer and 
a simile. Those who succeed get credit for both Geography 1 and English 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although the teachers' disciplines diverge dramatically, Selby and Krusoe say 
they have a common goal -- to teach students to observe closely and to record 
their observations with precision. "So many of our students have lost the 
ability to observe things that aren't fed to them," Selby said. "You have to be 
a good observer to be a great writer, and there's never been a great scientist 
who wasn't a great observer." 
</P>
<P>
During the six-week course, the students learn something about maps, weather 
and climate, geology and the plants and animals of Southern California. They 
work their way through a text called "Modern Physical Geography." Classroom 
lessons are supplemented with a weekly field trip, such as the recent hike to 
Eagle Rock in Topanga State Park. As the students are learning what an 
inversion is and why Los Angeles has this smog-trapping weather condition, they 
are also studying nature writing and learning how to string together their own 
words about the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, they have to learn to write in six weeks," Krusoe said. "It's a 
killer." 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe exposes the students to model nature writers as disparate as Romantic 
poet William Wordsworth and contemporary environmental activist Edward Abbey. 
According to Krusoe, Sue Hubbell's book, "Country Year," is especially useful 
to beginning nature writers. Hubbell is "an immaculate writer," he said, and 
her book, best known for its section on bees, is "about someone staying at 
home, paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
In critiquing students' journal entries, Krusoe is quick to praise evidence 
that they are paying close attention, whether observing an alligator lizard 
barely visible in the dust or a distant cluster of homes that look like a 
beehive when viewed from the mountains. "The funny thing about paying 
attention," he told his students, as they perched on Eagle Rock, moments after 
displacing a raven, "is that when you really see something, sometimes it's even 
better than just using your imagination." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Verbal Flourishes 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe said that students tend to "get too pretty" when they first begin to 
write about storm clouds and life cycles. Krusoe's reading assignments for the 
course are examples of writing about nature without verbal genuflection. The 
assigned writers have "natural voices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes those voices are downright peevish. Among the handouts for the class 
is one of Krusoe's own poems, titled "Nature," which includes the 
non-reverential lines: "Well why shouldn't he hate nature? / What's it ever 
done for him? Or me for that matter?" The poet said most of his work has an 
"urban feel." Krusoe said he wanted to teach the course with Selby in order to 
learn more about physical Southern California and "to learn how to write nature 
poetry that would interest me." 
</P>
<P>
As a geographer, Selby said he is repeatedly shocked and saddened at the lack 
of widespread knowledge about weather, the rock cycle and other natural 
phenomena. "It's scary to know that so many people know so little about the 
world we live in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Resting with the students on Eagle Rock, Selby talked about the materials -- 
mostly sandstone and conglomerates -- that formed the outcropping and the 
natural forces that created it and continue to shape it. Geology lessons are 
much more vivid in the wild than in the classroom, he noted. "You can't stand 
here and see the rock cycle, but you get a feeling for how the rock cycle is 
changing the landscape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Purposes 
</P>
<P>
Student Evelyn Batiste, 26, said she had taken the course to fulfill a science 
requirement and because she thought she would benefit from the writing 
component. After the first class, the Inglewood woman recalled, she was able to 
identify the stone in the campus parking lot as shale. As a result of the 
course, she said, she can think about things that she never even noticed 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Batiste has also become a seasoned hiker. On the first couple of outings, she 
was startled by every dive-bombing dragonfly. "I've really gotten better," she 
said, undaunted by the slither of a lizard in the dry grass. 
</P>
<P>
After Selby's geology lesson on Eagle Rock, Krusoe asked the students to read 
their journal entries aloud. Frank Kianfar, a 23-year-old business major, 
began: "The live oak trees drop their leaves, and they are dead even before 
they hit the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe had good things to say about all of the students' brief essays. Like a 
conscientious parent, he tries to teach his charges without battering their 
self-esteem. "On a really good day," the poet said, "I feel my compliments are 
as creative as anything I've ever done."

ENCOUNTER WITH POLICE LEAVES 3 VISITORS BITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here we were, three women alone, away from home for the first time in many 
years. Sent to beautiful Santa Monica to participate in a workshop by our home 
company, US Health Care of Blue Bell, Pa., and conducted by Value Health 
Services of Santa Monica. Away from our home and families for the first time in 
many years and after spending a very intense day of workshops looking for a 
pleasant evening at dinner and relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
We were told of a very fine restaurant called Ivy at the Shore along Santa 
Monica Beach. We decided to walk the short distance from our hotel, the Holiday 
Inn Bay View on Pico Boulevard, to the restaurant to allow the cobwebs to 
disappear as we strolled slowly to dinner. As out-of-towners, we were unaware 
of the dangers that were ahead. 
</P>
<P>
A few short blocks from our hotel, we encountered hundreds of derelicts and 
homeless lying on the streets. More of them, as we approached, began accosting 
us, begging for money, touching and pawing at us. As tourists, new to the area, 
we became very frightened. We looked around for help and to our surprise we saw 
a Santa Monica police officer across the street only a short distance away. 
</P>
<P>
The three of us ran from the crowd that surrounded us and bolted for the safety 
of the officer. Before we could explain our situation and ask for assistance, 
the officer, Gary Hagerman, Badge No. 2577, whipped out his citation book and 
stated that we had crossed the street against a red light and was going to 
issue each of us a ticket in violation of the city code. As we desperately 
tried to explain why we had crossed in such a hurry, Officer Hagerman refused 
to listen. He proceeded to ask us for our driver's license or any other 
identification so that he could properly issue us the citations. As this was 
taking place, a crowd of derelicts gathered around as Officer Hagerman 
proceeded in his official demeanor to ask us our names, addresses, color of 
eyes, height, weight, hair color and the hotel we were staying. Never once did 
he attempt to hear our dilemma or try to disperse the crowd that had gathered 
to listen in. 
</P>
<P>
After issuing us our citations, Officer Hagerman simply walked away, leaving us 
again at our own disposal . . . alone and scared. 
</P>
<P>
With this experience happening on our first evening in Santa Monica and with 
six more days to go, we continued to feel in jeopardy so we decided that our 
other evenings and free time would be spent somewhere else other than the 
"community" of Santa Monica. Being away from the street people and the "police 
state" of Santa Monica proved to be a much more pleasant experience for us all. 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, I received a copy of the citation and the summons from the Municipal 
Court of Santa Monica. This reminder of our stay has added to the bad taste and 
surly response we received from the officer we had fled to for "help." Enclosed 
find a copy of the check for $10 asked for by the good people of the Santa 
Monica courts for our "misconduct." I hope that this money goes to a fund that 
will help perpetuate the good name of Santa Monica so that other tourists and 
out-of-towners will continue to receive the kindness and understanding that we 
received while we were there. 
</P>
<P>
It is inconceivable to me that in this day and age in America, a citizen 
seeking help and finding a police officer would get the kind of treatment that 
we received that evening. Officer Hagerman should be placed on a pedestal by 
the city officials of Santa Monica and rewarded with a citation for duty "below 
and beyond" the call of duty. If all of the officers of Santa Monica serve 
their community as well, I feel sorry for the citizens of the city. Santa 
Monica deserves better!

mention at the time of being harassed by people on the street.

COUNCILMAN FACES FINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Ken Genser faces nearly $1,200 in fines for failing to file his 
campaign financial statement. 
</P>
<P>
Genser said his statement, which reports contributions made to the Friends of 
Ken Genser Committee from Oct. 27 through Dec. 31, 1988, is almost six months 
late because he has been too busy with personal and city business. Genser was 
elected to the City Council last November. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, a candidate must be fined $10 a day for each day the report is 
not filed after a written notice has been sent to the office seeker. City Clerk 
Clarice E. Johnsen sent Genser written notice on March 21 that his report had 
been due Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Johnsen said that Genser's former campaign treasurer, Roger Thornton, who 
resigned last month over the matter but has agreed to help Genser file the 
report, told her that the statement would be filed this week. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton could not be reached for comment.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY; 
</P>
<P>
CITY SUED OVER CLUB SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a defunct Culver City sports club has sued the city, alleging that 
it has taken his property without just compensation and denied his civil rights 
by rejecting his plans to build townhouses on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court earlier this month, charges that 
the City Council's April denial of the 30-townhouse project was unreasonable, 
given that the sports club had barely broken even in its nearly 15 years of 
operation. The council at that time also determined that the city could not 
afford to buy the club for a municipal recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks for $10 million in damages, which is what the owner estimates is 
the worth of the townhouse project, Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
A city-ordered study by a recreation consulting firm found that the Westside 
Sports Club, 4901 Overland Blvd., would not be able to compete in today's 
market without renovations costing as much as $540,000. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on July 3 decided to reconsider its April decision at hearing 
on August 14. 
</P>
<P>
The now-vacant club site is designated specifically for use as a sports club. 
</P>
<P>
"By refusing to change the designation of the property, (the city has), for all 
intents and purposes, taken the property without compensating the owner," 
Richard K. Ehrlich, said attorney Fred Gaines. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the city, also named as defendants are the City Council and four 
members who voted against the townhouse project: Steven Gourley, Jozelle Smith, 
James Boulgarides and Paul Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Gourley said he wanted to see the owner build some sports facilities nearby as 
a replacement. "If they're going to sell 30 condos, (the tenants) are going to 
be demanding recreation facilities. . . . It would be good for the community 
and good for the project -- it would be a selling point for their project as 
well."

L.A. AGREES TO PAY 20 HURT IN FAIRFAX EXPLOSION; 
</P>
<P>
AUTUMN TRIAL EXPECTED FOR SUITS AGAINST OTHERS STEMMING FROM 1985 BLAST AT 
STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years after a methane gas explosion ripped through a Fairfax-area clothing 
store, the city of Los Angeles has tentatively agreed to pay $75,000 to 20 
people injured in the blast and to the store's insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement would free the city from any further liability involving a 
series of lawsuits that are scheduled to go to trial as one consolidated case 
this fall. Seven other defendants, including the County of Los Angeles and the 
Southern California Gas Co., have already agreed to pay $364,000 in separate 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office has estimated that a jury verdict in favor of the 
blast victims would probably exceed $3 million, and an attorney for the victims 
and the insurance company said he will seek at least $10 million in damages. 
The insurance company, Industrial Indemnity, is seeking $2.25 million to 
recover claims resulting from the blast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Good Settlement' 
</P>
<P>
"Although the city ought to prevail if these actions were tried, the potential 
recovery by the plaintiffs is very large," the city attorney wrote in a report 
to the City Council. The city should settle "because of the extraordinary 
expenses involved in proceeding to trial and the risk involved due to the 
substantial damages suffered by the plaintiffs." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's Finance and Revenue Committee, following the city attorney's 
advice, recommended Tuesday that the council approve the settlement. The full 
City Council is expected to approve it in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Philip Shiner, who has handled the case, said in an 
interview that it would cost the city at least $75,000 to fight the case in 
court. He said it was safer for the city to pay the money up front and avoid 
further litigation. "It could be significant if (the jury) finds somebody at 
fault," he said. "It is a good settlement." 
</P>
<P>
Shiner said there were several other victims of the blast who are not part of 
the consolidated case, but, he said, none of them have active suits against the 
city. The city attorney's report to the council said other "minor claims" 
against the city may arise in the future, but it concluded that "whatever 
remains will not present any significant potential exposure to the city." 
</P>
<P>
The March 24, 1985, blast destroyed the Ross Dress For Less store on West 3rd 
Street, injured 23 people and forced the Fire Department to close off a 
four-square-block area for several days. Several of the victims received 
serious injuries, including one woman who was burned over 50% of her body and 
another who suffered burns on her hands, feet, legs and body. 
</P>
<P>
In their consolidated case against the city, the victims and insurance company 
alleged that the city contributed to the explosion in the clothing store's 
basement by paving streets and sidewalks around the store. 
</P>
<P>
The city's paved areas, the suit alleged, prevented underground methane gas 
from venting naturally into the atmosphere and forced it to migrate under the 
store and eventually inside it. The suit also alleged that the city's sewers 
and storm drains acted as a passageway for the gas to enter the building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Defendants 
</P>
<P>
Matthew B. F. Biren, the attorney for the victims and Industrial Indemnity in 
the consolidated case, said he is negotiating settlements with three other 
defendants, including the state of California. If those discussions are 
successful, he said, the trial would proceed against just two defendants: Park 
La Brea Associates (and its owners at the time, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. 
and May Co.) and McFarland Energy Co. 
</P>
<P>
Park La Brea owned the West 3rd Street property, and McFarland Energy operated 
nearby oil wells, which Biren alleges caused underground gas to migrate beneath 
the clothing store. Biren said his clients were willing to settle with the city 
of Los Angeles and the other defendants because they are considered "peripheral 
to the issue." 
</P>
<P>
"After having conducted tremendous investigation into the facts surrounding the 
accident, it appears the most likely thing facilitating the methane gas 
migration was the active slant wells being operated by McFarland Energy," Biren 
said. "We are confident that was what led to the migration of the methane gas 
to the explosion." 
</P>
<P>
McFarland has denied responsibility for the blast. Company officials did not 
return phone calls Tuesday.

'BOOM CARS' DO A NUMBER ON EARDRUMS OF PASSERS-BY

Two sleek mini-trucks cruised slowly through the beach parking lot, proclaiming 
their presence with a steady beat of high-powered booms that rolled from the 
pickups to the sea, out-rumbling the surf. 
</P>
<P>
On this blue, lazy beach day in Long Beach, Jesse Gonzalez and Eddie Lopez were 
out "booming" in their mini-trucks, playing the usual bass-heavy rap and soul 
music to shake up their cabs a bit -- let the Cherry Avenue beach crowd know 
they were around. 
</P>
<P>
In the ever-evolving world of car crazes, "boom cars" packed with elaborate, 
expensive and achingly loud stereo systems have become a nationally accepted 
badge of status for the young and the male, as well as an earsplitting 
annoyance to anyone within their expansive range.

"It's something that's going on right now," Lopez said, explaining, with 
simplicity if not insight, why he has spent nearly $5,000 on sound equipment 
and collected $1,200 in tickets for playing it too loudly. "When hot rodding 
was in, why did you want to speed?" 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, a hefty 21-year-old trash collector from Long Beach, cruises in a black 
Chevrolet mini-truck that seems propelled not by the forces of internal 
combustion, but by waves of sound that vibrate his cab seat with a nervous 
jiggle. On his truck's hood is a spray-painted mural of a figure of death 
carrying a limp woman. 
</P>
<P>
"She died of sound, too much sound," quipped a friend. 
</P>
<P>
It is too much for many communities that liken boomers' sonic stakeouts to a 
recurring migraine headache. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Long Beach, southeast Los Angeles County cities and Los Angeles 
have been trying to dull the thump of boom cars with ticket-writing crackdowns 
and in some cases, anti-noise ordinances. A state senator from Norwalk has even 
introduced a bill, passed by the Senate and now before the Assembly, that would 
make it a violation of the state Vehicle Code to play a vehicle's sound system 
so loud that it can be heard at a distance of 25 feet or more. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to sit at signals next to some of the deaf turkeys that own boom 
boxes and my whole body vibrated. They are a nuisance as well as a hazard," an 
angry Lakewood man wrote to Sen. Cecil Green (D-Norwalk), who introduced the 
anti-boom bill at the behest of City Council members from boom-plagued 
Southeast cities. 
</P>
<P>
Even the hard of hearing are not immune. "I have been boomed until my bad ear 
had pain," an elderly Bellflower man wrote Bellflower City Councilman Randy 
Bomgaars, who has been crusading for quieter streets. "We're a society that's 
responding more and more to noise and chaos," Bomgaars complained. "We need to 
return to peace and tranquility." 
</P>
<P>
Audiologists warn that the thunderous volumes of boom systems damage the 
hearing of boom buffs, and local officials worry that boom car drivers, 
oblivious to emergency sirens, will careen into police cars and ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
Stories are legion of the decibel muscle of sophisticated car-music systems, 
which can take up the entire flatbed of a mini-truck. Speakers often number in 
the double digits in a single system, which typically costs from $2,000 to 
$15,000 but can range as high as $80,000. The sound can explode car windows, 
bulge doors and set speakers on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Police Lt. Ken Schack recalls one young man who pushed up the volume 
until he could flip a coin into the air. "Kaboommm, the quarter bounced up off 
the roof," said Schack, who has heard boom cars approach with their 
intimidating thumps from as far as four blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a youth," Schack continued with a hint of nostalgia, "all the cars 
had been lowered in the back. Now we have stereo systems that nobody can get in 
the car and listen to because they die of traumatic injury." 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly, but the roar of super-loud systems does take its toll on ears. "No 
rational person would say these are safe levels," said Maurice H. Miller, chief 
of audiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equal to Airplane Engine 
</P>
<P>
Dale Lincoln, co-owner of Car Radio Sound Center Inc. in Long Beach, says the 
average system he installs can attain volume levels of about 125 decibels, or 
about the same as an airplane engine. Workers exposed to that much noise in a 
factory would have to wear hearing protection. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez is not worried. "I haven't lost none of my hearing," said Lopez, whose 
3-year-old son, a budding boomer, likes to go cruising, even though he can 
barely see out the truck window. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez so far has spent about $1,800 outfitting his second mini-truck with a 
boom system. His first truck, in which he had installed $3,000 worth of sound 
equipment, "got taken away from me at gunpoint" by two men who rode off with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The tickets Lopez and his buddies collect are seen as a relatively minor 
hindrance to the rites of booming. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
700-Watt System 
</P>
<P>
"We don't worry about them because all you do is pay," said Juan Chavez, a 
21-year-old forklift operator whose black net pullover and black pants matched 
his black Mazda mini-truck. He has been ticketed in Downey, Compton, Signal 
Hill and Long Beach. The noise citations average about $90 apiece but are not 
moving violations and do not go on a driver's record. 
</P>
<P>
Not that boomers want to get ticketed or think they deserve it. 
</P>
<P>
"This ain't no crime. We're not hurting nobody," argues Gonzalez, a bell 
captain at a Long Beach hotel who cranks up the 700-watt system that consumes 
half the bed of his mini-truck when the situation warrants it, such as, "Girls, 
other cars, competition. Whenever you want to show off." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez has what he calls "a police button" on his system. "It lowers the volume 
just like that." At his shop, Lincoln has even installed hidden switches on the 
floors of boom cars, enabling drivers to instantly silence their speakers 
without taking their hands off the wheel when a policeman rolls into view. 
</P>
<P>
But even boomers can grow weary of riding around with an insistent blare in 
their ears. "Sometimes I don't put it in for two days or a week. I get tired of 
it," admitted 21-year-old Lalo Ponce, who has a pullout tape deck in his Nissan 
mini-truck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Has Declined 
</P>
<P>
The boom mania took hold about three years ago. And though national sales of 
boom systems continue to soar, Lincoln says his business has markedly declined 
during the past couple of years, from about 40% of his sales to 20%. He 
attributes the slump partly to police ticketing and partly to a police 
crackdown on cocaine sales, which he suspects have financed a lot of the boom 
systems he has installed. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Wilson, owner of American Car Stereo &amp; Security in Bellflower and Long 
Beach, also points to ticketing as the reason his boom car installations have 
fallen off within the past year. "It's costing me about $10,000 a month in 
sales," Wilson grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite increased police attention, the number of anti-boom tickets issued 
in the Long Beach-Southeast area is relatively low. Sgt. Don Reeves of the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department said that since the beginning of the year, 
96 citations have been issued to boomers in the six Southeast cities policed by 
his department: Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Hawaiian Gardens, Paramount and 
Lakewood. Long Beach traffic police estimate they write 6 to 10 boom tickets a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The citations are issued under the same section of the state Vehicle Code that 
Sen. Green is proposing to amend. The code now prohibits operation of a "radio 
system intended to make sound audible outside the vehicle when the vehicle is 
being operated upon a highway," wording that some local authorities say is too 
vague to clearly apply to boom systems. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is enact statewide guidelines that will allow local 
authorities to enforce the law," said Renay Montane, a legislative assistant in 
Green's office. The proposal would not, however, make the noise citations a 
moving violation. The penalty would continue to be a fine. 
</P>
<P>
Cities, meanwhile, have taken action on their own. Los Angeles in 1986 added a 
section to the city code prohibiting anyone from playing a car music system 
that can be heard more than 200 feet away in a residential area. The Huntington 
Park City Council recently passed an ordinance making it illegal to operate a 
car sound system "plainly audible" at a distance of 25 feet from the vehicle. 
Bellflower last spring adopted an ordinance that limits noise from a boom car 
parked on private property. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a universal complaint. It's just like graffiti. People are sick of it," 
Artesia City Councilman James Van Horn said.

DINGELL: NAVY PERMITS USE OF SUSPECT SWITCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHACHTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy -- ignoring Pentagon investigators' warnings -- has permitted a 
missile manufacturer to continue using electronic switches whose faulty 
production by a small Southland firm could render the missiles' warheads 
useless, the head of a congressional oversight panel has charged. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich), in a letter released Wednesday, asked Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney to order independent testing of the inexpensive switches 
made by Asher Engineering Corp. in Baldwin Park to determine the harm, if any, 
done by alleged shoddy manufacturing practices. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst case, Dingell warned, flaws in the switches could force the 
"recall of seven years of missile production." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported in March that Asher's failure to properly test the tiny 
switches, which cost less than $20 each, had Pentagon officials concerned about 
the effectiveness of many of the tactical missiles in the U.S. arsenal. The 
switches are a critical piece of the firing mechanisms in Phoenix, Harm, 
Harpoon, AAMRAM, Standard, Sidewinder and Maverick missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its 
investigations subcommittee, said the Navy ignored critical audits of Asher by 
its own investigators in issuing a waiver last month that allowed Texas 
Instruments to install the switches in more than 350 Harm missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, the Navy's top quality-control official added his own 
objections, warning that test results to date did not justify using the 
switches and that their use posed "potential serious hazard to personnel, 
aircraft and missiles," according to an internal Navy memo released by the 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees No Problem 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department and Navy spokesmen declined to comment Wednesday on 
Dingell's letter. A Texas Instruments official, however, said the switches had 
been thoroughly tested and that none had failed. 
</P>
<P>
"The missile is warrantied, and we make sure the parts are good before we use 
them," said G. Dean Clubb, senior vice president and missile systems manager 
for Texas Instruments' defense systems and electronics group in Dallas. "There 
is no doubt in my mind these (switches) will certainly meet the needs of the 
missile system." 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Criminal Investigative Service has recommended that federal 
prosecutors in Los Angeles seek indictments of officials of Asher and Micronics 
International, a Brea company that is the prime contractor for the missile 
firing mechanisms of which Asher's switches are a part, according to William G. 
Dupree, the Pentagon's deputy assistant inspector general for investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell's letter said the Defense Department investigators have found that the 
switches did not meet military specifications, that they had not been tested 
correctly and that Asher was using equipment that had not been checked against 
Pentagon standards for as long as seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Asher, president of the firm, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
He told The Times in March that Micronics officials, under pressure from the 
military to deliver firing mechanisms on time, had ordered Asher employees to 
falsely certify that the switches met government specifications. 
</P>
<P>
Micronics since last fall has been the subject of a criminal investigation of 
alleged short cuts in its manufacture of firing mechanisms for the Phoenix 
missile. The Times reported in October that flaws in the devices had forced the 
Navy to mothball 500 missiles worth $425 million until replacement parts could 
be installed. 
</P>
<P>
Micronics officials have denied any wrongdoing. G. Addison Appleby, chairman 
and chief executive of Micronics' parent company, La Jolla-based Precision 
Aerotech, said Wednesday that he knew of no grounds on which Micronics could be 
indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Like Clubb, Appleby said the Asher switches had passed tests conducted by both 
the Navy and independent labs. The only certifications signed by Asher 
officials, he added, were those requested by the Navy.

CHENEY RAPS EASING OF COMPUTER CURBS TO SOVIETS; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE SECRETARY DISAGREES OPENLY WITH HEAD OF COMMERCE DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a rare public airing of a long-running bureaucratic dispute, Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney on Wednesday took issue with Commerce Department plans to 
ease export controls on the sale of some personal computers to the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives them significant capabilities they do not now possess," Cheney said a 
day after the Commerce Department announced its decision. "We would have 
preferred an arrangement that would have" permitted the sale of less 
sophisticated computers to the Soviet Bloc, Cheney added. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department, in a reversal of Reagan Administration policy, 
announced Tuesday that it would lift requirements that U.S. manufacturers 
obtain special licenses to sell certain medium-capacity computers to 
non-Communist countries. At the same time, the department said it would 
recommend that Washington and its allies drop a prohibition against the sale of 
these computers to the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies. 
</P>
<P>
That recommendation would clear the way for U.S. producers to sell the 
so-called AT-compatible units, described as "medium-capacity, mid-range" 
computers, to the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Since the United States was the only country in the 17-nation Coordinating 
Committee on Multilateral Exports to object to sale of such computers to the 
East Bloc, the approval of the Commerce Department's plan by CoCom is 
considered a virtual certainty. 
</P>
<P>
American companies have argued that the type of technology found in 
AT-compatible computers is already widely available from other sources in Asia 
and other nations that impose few, if any, controls on sales to the Soviet 
Union. U.S. export restrictions, which are intended to limit the flow of 
advanced technology to America's adversaries, have put domestic PC makers at a 
competitive disadvantage, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Liikala, Western regional director for the Commerce Department's Bureau 
of Export Administration, said the agency determined that similar computers 
were readily available from suppliers in 11 countries, including some in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We had evidence of assembly (of AT-compatible machines) in Hungary and 
Czechoslovakia," Liikala said. "Obviously, if they're manufacturing these 
things in the East Bloc, it's silly to recommend against U.S. sales to Eastern 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said he decided to air his disagreement with Commerce Secretary Robert 
A. Mosbacher, who made the decision, to correct published reports that 
indicated the defense secretary had met with Mosbacher and approved the 
Commerce Department decision. 
</P>
<P>
Following Cheney's remarks, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said 
President Bush supported Mosbacher's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Commerce Department was able to effectively lift the 
controls without notifying the President or Defense Department in advance. It 
did so by issuing the decision in the form of a "finding," which concluded that 
the computers already are widely available on international markets to East 
Bloc nations. 
</P>
<P>
In an 18-month inter-agency review of the computer-export policy, the Defense 
Department argued repeatedly that the restrictions should not be lifted. While 
the Pentagon's approval would have been necessary to change the policy 
formally, officials said the Commerce Department could proceed without Pentagon 
approval by issuing the decision as a regulatory change. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a decision that the secretary of commerce is empowered to make," said 
Marion Blakey, a Commerce Department spokeswoman. "It is final." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Disagreement 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that Cheney, formerly a conservative six-term 
congressman from Wyoming, openly differed with Bush Administration policy. And 
for the second time, the dispute focused on the Soviet Union's campaign to 
restructure economic and military policy, placing Cheney as a hard-liner who 
remains skeptical of Soviet intentions. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Cheney departed from the Bush Administration's position on Soviet 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, predicting that he would fail in his efforts to 
reform the Soviet system. Gorbachev would likely be replaced with a leader more 
hostile to the West, Cheney added. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent hearing, Cheney reiterated his views as a skeptic of Soviet reform, 
telling House members that the economic restructuring has as its goal the 
modernization of the Soviet military. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Cheney said he believed that the U.S. decision to allow the sale 
of the personal computers "will give them a computing capability that has 
military applications. That should be avoided," he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Aid Soviets 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied we are protecting technology," said Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
Former and current Pentagon officials said the sale of the computers could add 
substantially to Soviet military capabilities because they can be used together 
in large networks, improving the flow of basic and applied research as well as 
making better logistics and communications networks possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Apple II computer, one example of the medium-capability computers cleared 
for export, is used by U.S. forces in planning the targeting of tactical 
nuclear weapons in Europe, said one knowledgeable former official. 
</P>
<P>
If the eased export restrictions allow the transfer of the medium-capacity 
computer technology, said the former official, "all bets are off." That would 
allow the Soviets to use the computers to build still better computers and to 
improve the memory capacity and speed with which Soviet computers operate. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said it is unlikely that Cheney can persuade Bush to 
overturn Mosbacher's decision. But they added that the Commerce Department's 
handling of the decision offended Cheney's sense of fair play, and he could not 
remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheney is a guy of unusual commitment to fairness in the process," said one 
adviser. "He would never do something like this. I think he was shocked."

Steel Imports Rise: Although steel imports increased to 1.47 million tons in 
May, up 10% from April, they remained well below the level of a year earlier, 
according to an industry association. Imports for the first five months of the 
year were down dramatically, the American Iron &amp; Steel Institute said. 
Import tonnage for the first five months totaled 7.15 million tons, down 21% 
from January through May, 1988, the institute said. Foreign steel represented 
17.1% of the market in the first five months of this year, down from 20.7% in 
the 1988 period. The May tonnage represented 17.2% of the apparent supply in 
the U.S. market, compared to 16.4% in April and 21.5% in May, 1988.

Soybean Trading Data Demanded: Lee Adams, president of the American Soybean 
Assn., asked the Chicago Board of Trade to release trading positions of "all 
market participants that held (soybean) contracts for more than 1 million 
bushels in July soybean futures during May through July. If we do not get a 
quick and satisfactory response, we are prepared to take appropriate legal 
action," Adams said in a statement. The association represents soybean growers. 
The commodities exchange last week ordered holders of large July soybean 
positions to sell all holdings of more than 1 million bushels by today.

Time Inc. on Wednesday reported a 12% increase in its second-quarter net 
income, boosted by a hefty dividend from its stake in Turner Broadcasting 
System. The company did not disclose its costs associated with its pending 
acquisition of Warner Communications Inc., noting that the costs would be 
capitalized, or treated as a long-term investment. 
</P>
<P>
The corporation's second-quarter revenue rose nearly 11%, while costs and 
expenses rose almost 10%, compared to the same period a year ago. Time noted 
that its annual Turner dividend was recorded during the third quarter in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In another action, Time released its legal response to a lawsuit on appeal to 
the Delaware Supreme Court, where Paramount Communications Inc. is making a 
last-ditch effort to stop Time's acquisition of Warner. Paramount launched a 
hostile bid for Time in early June but was never able to force the company's 
board into negotiations. Last week, the Delaware Chancery Court ruled that 
Time's board had acted within its legal scope to press ahead with a plan to 
combine with Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, a banking source said Time and Warner have not targeted specific 
assets for sale to help defray Time's $14-billion cost of acquiring Warner, 
although he added that a sale of $1 billion to $3 billion in assets over the 
next few years would not be surprising. 
</P>
<P>
The banker spoke in response to a Wall Street Journal article that said Time 
has identified $1.3 billion in assets that could be sold along with 25% of its 
cable-TV systems to help pay for its $70-per-share acquisition of Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Time spokesman Louis J. Slovinsky declined to respond to any specific points in 
the Journal story, other than to say: "It sounds like . . . these (are) various 
scenarios that have been put together to demonstrate (Time's) credit-worthiness 
to the banks. . . . All of the stuff is theoretical, and some of it is dead 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
But another Time executive said vehemently that Time has not suggested -- in 
documents or personal meetings with bankers -- that it is considering a sale of 
25% of its cable holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Warner spokesman Geoffrey W. Holmes said he could readily identify $1.3 billion 
in assets that do not produce earnings or cash flow, such as Warner's 
investments in Turner Broadcasting System, Hasbro Inc. and Cinamerica theaters, 
but "by no means have they been marked for sale." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Holmes said, Warner has just exercised warrants in Hasbro, the toy 
manufacturer, which would increase its stake to about 10 million shares, or 
18.5% of the company. Warner, as an insider, can't sell shares for at least six 
months under federal securities rules, Holmes noted. 
</P>
<P>
And Warner General Counsel Martin Payson, who is slated to become a vice 
chairman of the combined company, said: "We're very confident we can handle the 
debt and we have no intention of selling any of the core businesses." 
</P>
<P>
Citing documents prepared by unidentified bankers, the Journal said Time 
management projects a 4.85% annual revenue growth through 1997 at Home Box 
Office, the cable programming subsidiary, while Time projects 11.67% average 
growth between 1990 and 1997 in revenue from its cable-TV systems. Magazine 
revenue is projected to grow 8.79% during the same seven-year period, while 
book revenue will grow 4.85%, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's stuff that shouldn't be out there," said the banker, who declined to 
comment on the accuracy of the data because he and other bankers pledged 
confidentiality. He noted, however, that at least 40 banks had access to Time's 
projections. "The timing (of the disclosure) is not good," the banker said, 
because Time and Paramount are still battling in court, with oral arguments 
scheduled Monday in Delaware Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
For the three months ended June 30, Time's operating income rose 14% to $197 
million, before the inclusion of interest expense or the $12-million pretax 
annual dividend from Turner Broadcasting System. Net income rose $10 million to 
$94 million.

Savings Bond Sales Off in June: U.S. Savings Bonds posted $623 million in sales 
in June, their highest level for the month since 1986, the Treasury Department 
reported. However, the total was down from May's sales of $695 million. The 
department said sales of $5.97 billion during the first nine months of the 
fiscal year ending Sept. 30 were 7% above sales during the same period in 
fiscal 1988. The government raised the interest rate on bonds to 7.81% from 
7.35% on May 1. The new rate is effective through Oct. 31.

TEXAS AIR ORDERS 50 JETS FROM BOEING; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERN TO GET SOME OF CONTINENTAL'S PLANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Texas Air Corp., parent company of Continental Airlines and of bankrupt and 
strikebound Eastern Airlines, said Wednesday that it has ordered 50 Boeing 
737-300 jetliners and taken options on another 50 in a deal that could 
eventually be worth $2.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
D. Joseph Corr, Continental's chairman and chief executive, told reporters at a 
news conference in Houston that his airline will get 30 of the planes and has 
taken options on 30 more. Continental also actually purchased and took the 
options on the remaining 40 planes, he said, but they will be assigned to 
Eastern. He said Continental plans to exercise the options. 
</P>
<P>
The planes, which carry between 120 and 130 passengers, are designed for 
domestic service. Corr said that it has not yet been determined how the 
acquisitions will be financed or whether the airliners will be leased or 
bought. Delivery of the aircraft will take place between 1992 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Corr also said during the news conference, in which out-of-town reporters 
participated by a telephone hookup, that Continental was also talking to 
Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, about 
the purchase at a later date of wide-body jets for overseas flights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eastern's Unions Critical 
</P>
<P>
In answer to a question Corr said the transaction requires the approval of 
Eastern's creditors committee. Eastern, which filed March 9 for protection from 
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, must file a 
reorganization plan with a bankruptcy court in New York by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to acquire the new 737s and to possibly order the wide-body aircraft 
was immediately criticized by union officials. Eastern's machinists, pilots and 
flight attendants have been on strike since March 4. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a smoke screen designed for the creditors," said Gary Greska, a 
spokesman in Miami for the Eastern local of the Air Line Pilots Assn. "Dangling 
a carrot in front of those creditors with the possibility of aircraft purchases 
may help sway those creditors to back approval of the Eastern reorganization 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
Boeing and General Electric, which makes engines, are among Eastern's major 
creditors, Greska noted. Other major creditors include Pratt &amp; Whitney, 
another engine maker, and Airbus. 
</P>
<P>
Corr also announced that Continental has agreed to acquire 11 Airbus A-300 
airliners from Eastern for $291 million, plus $12.5 million in spare parts. 
Continental also will acquire the leases of two DC-10-30s and buy Eastern's 
DC-10 spare parts inventory for $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continental to Lease Planes 
</P>
<P>
Eastern no longer needs those large aircraft, Corr said, "as it changes to a 
smaller, economically viable carrier." Eastern has said it intends to shrink 
itself by selling $1.8 billion worth of its assets in an effort to achieve 
profitability. 
</P>
<P>
Continental, on the other hand, will lease to Eastern 16 DC-9-30s, and Eastern 
will also have an option to lease up to nine Boeing 727-200s from its sister 
airline in 1990 and another nine 727-200s the following spring. The planes are 
now leased to other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Pilots spokesman Greska said Eastern is getting the "short end of the stick" in 
this transaction because the DC-9s are old planes that carry only 99 
passengers. "They are trading greyhounds for mutts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Corr said that the transactions between Eastern and Continental had taken place 
"at arm's length" and that they give "fair value to both companies." In the 
past, Eastern's unions have charged that Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air, 
was diverting assets from Eastern to Continental to weaken Eastern. Continental 
is a non-union carrier and Eastern is unionized. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ritchie Gets Financing 
</P>
<P>
In another development Wednesday, Chicago options trader Joseph Ritchie, whose 
earlier offer for Eastern was rejected, said he has secured $280 million for 
another bid to buy the airline. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Reuters news agency, Ritchie said he still wants to 
buy Eastern and could satisfy creditors' claims against the carrier. Ritchie 
said Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., a New York investment bank, has agreed to 
secure $280 million in financing for a bid. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not in the form of a signed letter, but we have a commitment from them," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo has said for many months that Eastern is no longer for sale.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: A GOOD PROGRAM GETS EVEN BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard O'Reilly, RICHARD O'REILLY designs microcomputer applications for 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago, when people talked about using their home computers for 
balancing their checkbooks, it was mostly wishful thinking. You could do the 
work faster with a hand calculator. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Quicken, a program published by Intuit of Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
The first two versions of Quicken, which carried a suggested retail price of 
$50, made it easy to manage personal bank accounts. Small businesses, and some 
not so small, also often chose Quicken to keep track of their finances instead 
of using more complicated accounting programs or spreadsheets. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Intuit has created Version 3 of its program for IBM and compatible 
computers. Despite the $10 price increase to $60, it is a better bargain than 
ever. (A new version for the Macintosh, 1.5, also was introduced that 
essentially brings to the Mac the features of the old PC version of Quicken.) 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the PC version of the program offers special features for 
people in business. At the same time, home users will find the new credit card 
account feature a great way to keep their plastic play money from bankrupting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Version 3 of Quicken adds many new features while remaining similar enough to 
the previous versions to make it simple for existing users to make the switch. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the surface, however, there are fundamental differences. First of all, 
separate accounts are no longer necessarily maintained as separate computer 
files but instead can be grouped together in a single set of master data files. 
That makes it easy to record transfers from one account to another, such as 
entering a payment to a credit card account while posting it to the checking 
account from which it was made. 
</P>
<P>
Where previous versions of Quicken recognized only one type of account, the 
checking account, the new versions define five types: checking, cash, credit 
card, asset and liability. Business users will find such classifications 
particularly useful, but individuals could use them to create a total net worth 
statement. (The new Mac version is still limited to checking accounts.) 
</P>
<P>
In previous PC versions, a transaction could be identified on only one level -- 
called a category. The program, though, could split a transaction among several 
categories. For instance, a bill from a discount store could be divided among 
the several categories it covers, such as "household," "clothing" and "toys." 
</P>
<P>
Quicken version 3 adds two other levels of identification. Transactions can be 
grouped into classes of income or expenses such as "Rental-1" and "Rental-2" to 
identify all receipts and expenditures associated with two separate rental 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
Within that class, categories could be established, such as "repairs" or 
"insurance." Those can be further divided into subcategories, perhaps 
"plumbing" and "heating" and "appliance" under the repairs category. 
</P>
<P>
Another handy feature is that any category or subcategory can be tagged as 
tax-related, allowing quick preparation of a report showing just the subtotals 
and totals needed for tax filings. 
</P>
<P>
The new credit card account feature makes it very easy to monitor each of your 
credit card accounts in as much or as little detail as you wish. For instance, 
you can enter as individual transactions only those credit card purchases of 
which you wish to keep track. 
</P>
<P>
The program lets you lump all the other transactions together into a single 
entry into your account. As a result, it balances with your monthly statement 
without forcing you to do the extra work of typing in listings that you don't 
need to monitor. 
</P>
<P>
When you want to make a payment on your account, you make the appropriate menu 
selection in Quicken and are presented with a form in which to enter the amount 
to be paid and the checking account from which the funds are to be drawn. The 
transaction is automatically entered into that account by the program and then 
the computer can print the check. 
</P>
<P>
Check printing has been improved with the new Quicken, with five styles of 
checks now available. Laser printing of checks was nicely enhanced with a 
feature that lets you save check forms by allowing printing on partly used 
forms. Because laser printers normally must run a full sheet a paper through 
each time they print, previous versions of Quicken wasted any unused blank 
checks on a sheet if all of them weren't needed in that printing session. 
</P>
<P>
A number of special reports can be printed by Quicken including ones for cash 
flow, monthly budget, itemized categories, tax summary and account balances. 
Business users will appreciate the profit and loss statement, accounts payable, 
accounts receivable, payroll, balance sheet and job/project reports included in 
the new version. 
</P>
<P>
Quicken has been one of the best-selling software programs for more than a 
year. The new version provides many new reasons for that popularity to 
continue.

<P>
QUICKEN: THE SPECS 
</P>
<P>
A simple but powerful financial accounting program for home and small-business 
use. The new versions, Quicken version 3 for the IBM PC and compatibles and 
version 1.5 for the Apple Macintosh, have a suggested retail price of $60. 
</P>
<P>
Features 
</P>
<P>
Tracks checking accounts, credit cards, cash, assets and liabilities. Prints 
checks. Automates transactions. Compatible with electronic banking. Provides 
specialized tax and business accounting reports and personal net worth report. 
The Macintosh version lacks multiple account types and multiple categories but 
has improved reporting features. 
</P>
<P>
Requirements

PEOPLE: NATIONAL EDUCATION NAMES ACTING CHIEF IN SHAKE-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a management shake-up just two days after it reported an unexpected 
$1.5-million second-quarter loss, National Education Corp. announced that a 
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has been named to replace longtime 
top executive H. David Bright as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. David C. Jones -- chairman of the Joint Chiefs from 1978 to 1982 -- also 
will replace Bright as acting chief executive until a permanent CEO is found, 
according to a statement released by the Irvine-based company -- the nation's 
largest provider of educational training services. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 68, has served as a director of National Education since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
National Education executives were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
And Bright, reached at his home, hung up after stating that he had "no comment 
to make." 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, National Education has suffered a series of setbacks. On 
Monday, the company reported a $1.5-million loss for the quarter ended June 30, 
contrasted with a $7.6-million profit in the same period a year earlier. 
Revenue was down 8% to $96.6 million from $105 million. 
</P>
<P>
The root of the problems, according to analysts, is the company's largest 
subsidiary, Applied Learning International. National Education formed the 
company from several acquisitions it made in the mid-1980s. The goal was to 
become a major player in the corporate training industry, but numerous 
problems, including computer snafus and a disorganized sales staff, have 
stymied that effort. 
</P>
<P>
Applied Learning's president William Roach resigned last September after 
bitterly clashing with Bright over the direction of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Education's core business -- vocational schools -- is 
suffering, too. Enrollments have been flat for most of the year, and the 
company is having to spend more on marketing to attract students. 
</P>
<P>
Bright was hired in 1972 by company founder John J. McNaughton to help the 
company reverse a string of losses. He was successful in overhauling National 
Education and was named its chairman in 1988. Bright will remain a director of 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
Although the management change was not announced until after the stock market 
closed Wednesday, National Education's common shares -- which took a drubbing 
Tuesday -- rebounded a bit to close at $15, up 50 cents for the day in light 
trading. The stock had closed Tuesday at $14.50, down $2.25, with nearly 2.3 
million shares changing hands. GREGORY CROUCH

Ameritech: The Chicago-based telecommunications company's second-quarter net 
income fell 9.8% from last year to $316.6 million. The 1988 quarter included a 
$42.1-million gain from the sale of its interest in Cantel, a Canadian cellular

SECURITY PACIFIC OPENS UNIT FOR SMALL BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
FOCUS TO BE FIRMS WITH SALES OF UP TO $25 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Security Pacific National Bank is arming itself for serious combat for the 
pocketbooks of small business, a growing market that has long been served 
primarily by smaller financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The bank on Wednesday named Stephen G. Carpenter as vice chairman in charge of 
running Security Pacific's new Middle Market Bank, which was formed a little 
more than a week ago to concentrate on businesses with sales ranging from about 
$2 million to $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific has three other vice chairmen who head the company's retail, 
merchant and business divisions. All four vice chairmen report to Robert H. 
Smith, president and chief executive of Security Pacific National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The new Security Pacific push is part of a move by all the big California banks 
to exploit a rapidly growing segment of business that has been credited with 
creating many of the economy's new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statewide Approach 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most attractive markets in banking today," said David C. 
Holman, First Interstate Bank of California executive vice president and 
divisional manager for Orange County and the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
Holman developed a small business project that was rolled out statewide early 
this year. First Interstate's approach is to decentralize decision making and 
to have experienced senior officers available to make decisions on local 
business loan applications. 
</P>
<P>
Among big banks, Wells Fargo Bank led the race for the business of small 
business two years ago when it launched its Business Banking Group. Bank of 
America in May announced a return to the small-business commitment of its 
founder, A. P. Giannini, by creating what it calls the Small Business Alliance, 
a package of discount services including price breaks on publications, payroll 
service, car rentals and seminars. 
</P>
<P>
At Security Pacific, the target is to boost small-business lending to the $8 
billion-to-$10 billion range in five years from about $1.5 billion now, Smith, 
the chief executive, said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sophisticated Services 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that we haven't done a particularly good job on," Smith said. 
"It's been something that's been to some degree gnawing at me for some time 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the Middle Market Bank, which will be a separate organization within 
Security Pacific, will offer smaller companies the sort of sophisticated 
financial products that traditionally have been available only to large firms. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter -- a banker for more than 25 years -- previously was an executive 
vice president with Wells Fargo, heading that bank's middle market operations 
in Southern California. Carpenter, 49, also was named a member of Security 
Pacific's high-level Office of the Bank and of the management committees of 
both the parent Security Pacific Corp. and the bank itself. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific named James A. Robinson, 55, and Daniel F. Wheeler, 42, to 
executive vice president posts serving the Middle Market Bank.

MORNING REPORT: COMEDY PROVES TEMPTING TO RENTERS

Comedy really is king in the summer rental market. Of the top six titles on the 
Billboard rental chart, five are comedies. The only drama is "The Accused," 
which boasts Jodie Foster's Oscar-winning performance. The newest addition to 
the Top Five, "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" (No. 3), may just be the next No. 1 
rental. "Twins," a perennial also-ran to "Coming to America," may soon run out 
of gas. "The Accidental Tourist" jumped from No. 10 to No. 6. Rental chart 
debuts: "Cocoon: the Return" (No. 13) and "Torch Song Trilogy" (No. 24). On the 
sales chart, the new No. 1 video is "Pink Floyd: Delicate Sound of Thunder." 
</P>
<P>
*Director Martin Scorsese's controversial "The Last Temptation of Christ" is 
proving to be quite a temptation for renters. In its second chart week, it 
jumped from No. 34 to No. 11. Since none of the anticipated protests against 
video stores have materialized, those who were scared away from theaters last 
year by all the protests are flocking to rent it.

'GUERRILLA ARTIST' ROBBIE CONAL STRIKES AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICOLE ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine months after Robbie Conal was ordered by the City of Los Angeles to stop 
putting up his satirical posters on city property and pay $1,300 for their 
removal, posters by the self-described "guerrilla artist" have re-emerged 
plastered on walls from Malibu to downtown, virtually next door to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Conal and his band of volunteers decided to use "guerrilla 
etiquette," in putting up the three posters, titled "Sex, Drugs and Rock &amp; 
Roll." The black-and-white charcoal prints show a dejected John Tower dressed 
in a pin-striped suit with the caption "Sex," a smiling President Bush sporting 
a baseball hat with the caption "Drugs" and an angry-looking Lee Atwater, the 
Republican national chairman, with "Rock &amp; Roll" boldly written underneath. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my urban guerrillas to be nice to City Hall and not put them up on 
freeway overpasses or traffic light switching boxes or anything obviously L.A. 
City property," Conal said. 
</P>
<P>
So far Conal has received no complaints from the city, even though he still 
owes the $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had any recent problems with him," explained Dave Torrez, senior 
street use inspector at the L.A. Bureau of Street Maintenance, after admitting 
that he had not seen any of the new posters. The posters have been on display 
on construction sites and abandoned buildings since early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for RTD's Metro Rail Project protested Conal's work, which 
had been pasted to the gray-painted plywood walls around the construction site 
at the corner of Olive and 1st streets, in the shadow of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We object to any signs posted on our fences or any form of graffiti, 
regardless of content," explained Greg Davy, a spokesman for the RTD. "The 
reason is purely aesthetic. We want to keep our sites nice looking," he said. 
The construction walls have "no bills" signs. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Frandsen, one of Conal's 40 "urban guerrillas" who helped place Conal's 
latest work, said that they made sure not to put the posters on city or private 
property, putting them only on construction sites that had no restrictive 
signs. "He wanted us to be careful not to violate any city laws." 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Conal had a hearing with the city for violating an ordinance by 
putting his posters on traffic signal boxes or other public utility devices. 
According to Torrez, Conal was billed for removal costs of $1,307.75 and 
"agreed not to do it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But one recent night Conal and his volunteers packed themselves into 15 cars 
and fanned out across the city in groups of four. They carried cans of glue, 
paint brushes and stacks of posters. 
</P>
<P>
"We met at Canter's Deli in Fairfax at about midnight and Robbie told us where 
not to put the posters and how to paste them up so that they could be taken 
down easily," explained Frandsen, a 41-year-old graphic artist. 
</P>
<P>
By 2 a.m. Saturday morning the "Sex, Drugs and Rock &amp; Roll" posters could 
be seen plastered along Pacific Coast Highway, mid-Wilshire, Fairfax, Melrose, 
Hollywood, Venice, Santa Monica, Mar Vista, Palms, North Hollywood, East Los 
Angeles, South Central Los Angeles, Reseda Boulevard, Ventura Bouvelard, Van 
Nuys and Laurel Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"They are three separate posters that hang together," the Venice-based artist, 
said explaining the design. He and film title designer Debbie Ross conceived 
the triptych over breakfast. "One is Sex. That's John Tower. Thats my safe-sex 
poster, once you see that, you not only don't want to have sex, but you feel 
nauseous and don't feel like eating again." 
</P>
<P>
"The drugs poster is George Bush, lest we forget his involvement with Noriega. 
I put a little stuff on his nose -- he looks high as a kite." 
</P>
<P>
"Lee Atwater is Rock &amp; Roll. He played the guitar at the Inauguration with 
Bo Diddley. Atwater is responsible for one of the dirtiest campaigns in years." 
(He was rebuked for circulating a memo which stated that a prominent Democratic 
congressman was a homsexual.) 
</P>
<P>
Conal said that no specific event led to the poster. "I was thinking about the 
changeover from the Reagan to the Bush Administration and the chameleon-like 
character of the new Administration," he said. "And I just wanted to provide a 
little surprise in the morning for people going to work and encourage people to 
think about issues of national importance." 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old artist plans to take his "Sex, Drugs and Rock &amp; Roll" 
posters on a summer tour to Chicago, New York, Washington and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"The City of Los Angeles and I just had a misunderstanding. It was just a 
lovers' quarrel," Conal said of his only run-in with a city. But he quickly 
pointed out: "I never signed any agreement. My agreement with the City of Los 
Angeles is based on great faith on their part that I will do the right thing. 
I'm just trying to be as good a boy as a bad boy can be."

MULTIMEDIA 'NEVSKY': RUSSIAN CLASSIC GOES HIGH-TECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High technology continues to find new application in the arts. Ten years ago, 
the idea of synchronizing a live performance of Prokofiev's carefully written 
music with a screening of Sergei Eisenstein's 1938 film masterpiece "Alexander 
Nevsky" would have seemed an eccentric pipe dream. 
</P>
<P>
Yet tonight at Hollywood Bowl, the Eisenstein-Prokofiev collaboration will be 
presented just that way with Yuri Temirkanov conducting the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic and Master Chorale. In addition, a sound track of Russian 
dialogue, charging horses and clashing swords is supposed to be synchronized 
with the film and music, as well as English subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the technical wizardry and previous success with the event, many 
fingers are crossed because of the unique outdoor environment at the Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part is the straitjacket of synchronizing the music with the 
film," said Christine Cairns (pronounced with a long a) in the lobby of her 
Hollywood hotel. The 30-year-old Scottish mezzo-soprano will sing the solo song 
that occurs toward the end of the movie in the presentation tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make sure everything fits and that sometimes prevents us from using 
rubato or taking liberty with the tempos," she said. "If the music gets a 
little bit behind the picture, we have to speed up and if we go ahead, we have 
to slow down." 
</P>
<P>
Cairns has sung the solo part of this version of "Alexander Nevsky" at every 
performance since it was premiered in October of 1987 by the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic under the baton of Andre Previn. That success led to several 
subsequent presentations of the multimedia event in other cities with other 
orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
"But I get a little emotional when I am here in Los Angeles because this is 
where it all started for me," she said. "John Currie (director of the Los 
Angeles Master Chorale) first introduced me to Previn and suggested me for the 
'Alexander Nevsky' solo when they were doing a concert version of the 'Nevsky' 
cantata in 1986 and later, a recording. It was the first real break in my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Cairns first met Temirkanov when she performed the work with him in 
Philadelphia. Their collaboration there met with great critical success, one 
critic describing it as a "pulsating, supercharged account of the score." 
Another critic pointed out that Temirkanov "fit the playing so skillfully to 
the pace of the film that the matter of synchronization did not loom, even 
momentarily, as a hazard of performance." 
</P>
<P>
Other performances in Cleveland with conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy tested the 
waters for outdoor performances, adding a certain drive-in-movie-like 
atmosphere to the event. If all goes well, Cairns plans to travel to London and 
Pompeii with the production. 
</P>
<P>
She is especially careful not to express favoritism for one conductor over the 
other, but did mention that Previn's preliminary work on the score before the 
1987 performance laid out the necessary groundwork for the other conductors. 
</P>
<P>
"Previn's work as a film composer and conductor for so many years obviously 
gave him insight into the process of putting something like this together," she 
said. "But in addition to his film expertise, his interpretation of Prokofiev 
is simply magical. 
</P>
<P>
"The advantage that the Russian conductors (Temirkanov and Ashkenazy) have is 
that they understand the dialogue and can therefore follow the movie better," 
said Cairns, who does not speak Russian. She learned her part phonetically and 
now performs it from memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Temirkanov's interpretation is also wonderful," she added carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Another steadfast devotee to this project is producer John Goberman, who worked 
on the original Los Angeles premiere as well as the performances in 
Philadelphia and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"This has never been done before -- not like this," said Goberman. "There are 
live scores performed to silent pictures all the time, but none like this with 
a sound movie and great music like Prokofiev's." 
</P>
<P>
Goberman explains that a four-track magnetic recording is used. Two of the 
tracks are used for the dialogue and sound effects. Another track operates 
slide machines which flash English subtitles below the screen, translating the 
rapidly moving Russian dialogue. The final track operates a special clock 
mounted to the conductor's music stand. A computer program controls these 
various functions. 
</P>
<P>
Prokofiev's re-orchestrated Cantata was used with supplemental orchestrations 
and sequences added by William Brohn. The sound effects on the original sound 
track were also enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
"The necessity of this project rests on the special collaboration between 
Eisenstein and Prokofiev," said Goberman. "It wasn't just a matter of Prokofiev 
scoring the movie. Some parts of the film were made to follow Prokofiev's music 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally the sound track was very garbled, poorly recorded. That's why we 
need to use a set-up like this to experience the work as it was originally 
imagined."

SIOUX CITY, Iowa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Schemmel had escaped the burning United Airlines DC-10 after it crashed 
here Wednesday and found safety in a cornfield. But he heard the cries of a 
baby coming from the smoking wreckage and he plunged back into the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"I found her -- a baby girl -- in an overhead compartment, beneath a bunch of 
stuff, and pulled her out," Schemmel, 29, said after he had been examined and 
released from a Sioux City hospital. "By that time it (the plane) was filled 
with smoke and I just ran with her. I ran down one of the corn rows." 
</P>
<P>
Another survivor, Charles Martz, described how he staggered from the plane into 
a cornfield that had been transformed into a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"Bodies were strewn all over the place," Martz said. "Bodies had burns, their 
clothing burned off, stripped off." 
</P>
<P>
Similar tales of heroism and horror were told by survivors who were on Flight 
232, bound from Denver to Chicago, when it crashed, broke up and erupted in 
flames as it attempted an emergency landing in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"The plane came down. It bounced twice, flipped into the air and we were 
sitting there upside down and it began to fill up with smoke," said Cliff 
Marshall, who was returning home to Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"Then God opened a hole in the basement (the bottom of the plane) and I pushed 
a little girl out. I grabbed another, kept pulling them out until they didn't 
come no more." 
</P>
<P>
Half or more of the 293 passengers and crew members on the airplane survived 
and many of them walked away from the flaming remains of the wide-bodied jet. 
</P>
<P>
C.O. Miller, a former chief investigator for the National Safety Transportation 
Board, called the survival rate remarkable. James Hamilton, an official at a 
local hospital, said it was amazing that people walked away from the wreckage 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
The early-afternoon flight was about halfway from Denver to Chicago when the 
passengers heard what several described as a big jolt or bump followed by a 
bang. The sound of the three-engine plane changed. 
</P>
<P>
"The pilot got on the speaker system and said that one of the engines had 
blown, that there was nothing to worry about, that there were two other 
engines, that we wouldn't have any problem," said Schemmel, deputy commissioner 
of the Continental Basketball Assn., who was on his way to Columbus, Ohio, with 
another league official. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Damages Tail 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later the captain told the passengers that the engine explosion 
had damaged the tail of the aircraft and that they would have to land in Sioux 
City, a city of about 80,000 in northwestern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot told the passengers that the landing probably would be a little rough 
because he did not have a lot of control over the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The passengers were not told that pieces of the engine apparently had severed 
the hydraulic controls, leaving the pilot almost completely unable to maneuver 
the huge jet. The pilot reported by radio to air traffic controllers that he 
had sustained a complete hydraulic failure. 
</P>
<P>
The plane descended gradually to about 11,000 feet and began to circle the 
Sioux City airport while emergency crews were assembled on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Aboard the aircraft, there was no panic. The flight attendants told the 
passengers how to prepare for an emergency landing by putting their heads 
between their legs. The crew described how to evacuate the plane from all 
available exits. The in-flight movie continued to play on the screens in the 
cabin. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not aware of the danger," Schemmel said. "I don't know much about 
flying, but I certainly heard a lot of stories about one engine quitting and 
there being no problem. So I wasn't worried about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Struggle to Cope 
</P>
<P>
The plane kept dipping, pitching and circling in one direction as the pilot and 
co-pilot struggled to cope with the hydraulic failure. 
</P>
<P>
"For 35 minutes, we knew something was wrong and for 10 or 15 minutes we knew 
something was dramatically wrong," said Brad Bayless of Highlands, Colo., as he 
stood in the lobby of the airport terminal after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
David Lansberger told a television interviewer: "Everybody was pretty calm. We 
really thought we were going to land and walk off. They said it was going to be 
a real hard landing. I didn't think it was going to be this hard." 
</P>
<P>
Martz, 58, is a former Navy pilot who still flies for his personal business. In 
a telephone call to his wife in Castle Rock, Colo., he praised the pilot's 
ability in bringing the crippled plane so close to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
He said that his experience as a pilot told him that the problems were probably 
far more serious than the pilot was telling the passengers as the plane circled 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I could tell it was worse than that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 minutes after the engine explosion, the pilot told passengers to get 
in position for the landing. He said that the plane would touch down in about 
30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Three or four minutes later, as the plane aimed for a 9,000-foot runway at the 
airport and emergency crews watched in horror, the right wing dipped into the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"We did somersaults," recalled Bayless, who was seated directly next to the 
right wing. 
</P>
<P>
Another passenger seated near the front of the aircraft told a local radio 
station: "When we hit, the plane broke right in front of me. It rolled over 
twice, I think, then it burst into flames. I grabbed an old lady in front of me 
and a baby and I went out of the plane." 
</P>
<P>
Schemmel was seated on the aisle in row 26. Next to him was Jay Ramsdell, the 
commissioner of the basketball league. 
</P>
<P>
"The section we were in rolled over at least twice," said Schemmel. "It might 
have been more than that. It happened so fast I don't remember. 
</P>
<P>
"After we first hit, we stopped in a very short time. It seemed like seconds. I 
was expecting to be sliding for a long time, but we stopped suddenly because we 
were in a cornfield. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came to a stop, I was upside down in my seat. I unbuckled my seat belt 
and fell to what would be the roof, because we were turned over. I found out 
that I was fine and I started helping other people. I looked to my right, there 
were flames coming out of the wall." 
</P>
<P>
Several passengers described the first frantic seconds after the plane came to 
a halt. Some rushed for the openings and others fought to rescue as many people 
as they could. 
</P>
<P>
Lansberger said the calm before the crash turned into pandemonium, with noise 
and screams everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I just remember thinking, 'This is what it is like to die,' " he told CNN 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to get as many people out before the fire hit," said Bayless in the 
airport lobby, massaging a bump on his head. "I saw fire out of my window right 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Rod Vettor echoed Bayless, saying: "We ended up upside down in a cornfield with 
fire. We did everything we could to get people out of the airplane." 
</P>
<P>
Lori and Mark Michaelson were traveling with their infant daughter and 
6-year-old son in Row 11. They unbuckled their seat belts and, in the confusion 
and smoke and fire, they left the plane without the baby. 
</P>
<P>
"I went back in the plane to find my daughter," Mark Michaelson told a TV 
interviewer. "I couldn't see her because it was dark. I heard her cry. I knew 
it was her cry but I couldn't hear it again. Others were coming out. I was 
walking forward shouting: 'I'm looking for my baby.' At that point the smoke 
got worse." 
</P>
<P>
He left the plane, searching for the rest of his family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grabs Young Boy 
</P>
<P>
Ron Rhode of Columbus, Ohio, was riding next to an 8-year-old boy from Prairie 
View, Ill. He grabbed the child and held him tight as the plane bounced and 
flipped over on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"The plane hit, bounced and we ended up upside down," said Rhode. "I let him 
go." 
</P>
<P>
The boy, Ben Radtke, was unharmed. He was still wearing the red-and-white badge 
that United gives to minors traveling alone. 
</P>
<P>
Schemmel lives in Denver, but he is a native of Sioux Falls. He worked for a 
time as a basketball broadcaster before joining the Continental Basketball 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"He is so calm," said his wife, Diane, in a telephone interview from their 
home. "He is just a really mellow person." 
</P>
<P>
As the plane filled with smoke, Schemmel tried in vain to put out part of the 
fire in his broken section with a blanket and then saw sunlight through the 
darkening cabin. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an opening," he recalled. "Everybody was heading for the back of the 
plane where the opening was. So I helped some people out for as long as I 
could, when the flames just got too heavy and I had to get out. It was chaos. 
</P>
<P>
"I got outside the plane. It was right in the cornfield. I had gotten a few 
feet out and heard a baby crying, and so I went back in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the plane, wedged in an overhead bin, he found the infant girl and 
carried her out of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran down one of the corn rows," he said. "The corn stalks were about seven 
feet tall and I couldn't really see anything. I got to a little bit of a 
clearing and I handed the baby to a lady who looked like she was all right. She 
took the baby and took off toward the road." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the plane, Michaelson spotted a woman carrying his baby daughter. He 
ran up to her and she said that a man had just handed her the child. He said he 
didn't know who brought his baby off the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"Just some hero," he said.

Survivors told of terror and heroism as their crippled DC-10 struggled 
Wednesday to reach an airport and then crashed and broke up while attempting an 
emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
"The plane came down. It bounced twice, flipped into the air and we were 
sitting there upside down and it began to fill up with smoke," said Cliff 
Marshall of Columbus, Ohio, who was returning home from Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"Then God opened a hole in the basement (the bottom of the plane) and I pushed 
a little girl out. I grabbed another, kept pulling them out until they didn't 
come no more." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said he thought he helped a half-dozen people out and then he ran. 
</P>
<P>
There were a reported 289 passengers and crew members on the United Airlines 
flight, en route from Denver to Chicago, when it crashed while trying to land 
at the airport in this western Iowa city. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified survivor interviewed by KMNS radio in Sioux City said that 
about a half-hour before the crash "there was a big, loud noise that kind of 
shook the plane." 
</P>
<P>
"The pilot got on and said one of our engines had blown and quit. He said when 
it blew it hurt the tail of the plane and the pilots couldn't control the 
plane," the passenger said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the plane circled for about a half-hour "while the pilots figured out 
what to do. Then they said we were preparing for a crash landing. They said it 
would be about 30 seconds, but it was about five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"When we hit, the plane broke right in front of me. It rolled over twice, I 
think, then it burst into flames," he said. "I grabbed an old lady in front of 
me and a baby and I went out the plane. Then I looked back and there were 
flames and I ran into the cornfield." 
</P>
<P>
Crash survivor Melanie Cincala of Toledo, Ohio, said: "I think it (the plane) 
turned over a couple of times. I think it landed upside down. I can remember 
picking up a little baby . . . and carrying the baby out of the plane." 
</P>
<P>
She said there was a fire on the plane, and a fireball "flashed past us." The 
plane burst into flames after she got off, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Rhode of Columbus said he was sitting with an 8-year-old boy, Ben Radtke of 
Prairie View, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"The plane hit, bounced and we ended upside down. I let him go," Rhode said. 
</P>
<P>
Rhode said he and another passenger, Danny Surue of Chicago, threw the boy from 
the plane and then got out themselves. Surue said: "The boy was sitting by 
himself, alone, and they said we were going to crash, so Ron got up and went 
over and sat by him." 
</P>
<P>
Radtke was not hurt, but said he was afraid he was going to die. The boy still 
wore his United Airlines badge. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Vettor, who suffered bruises in the crash, said passengers braced for the 
landing after the pilot announced the emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Vettor, who said he was in Row 20, said another survivor in Row 9 told him the 
plane split right in front of his seat. 
</P>
<P>
"We ended up upside down in a cornfield with fire," Vettor said. "We did 
everything we could to get people out of the airplane." 
</P>
<P>
Another survivor, Charlie Martz, told a broadcaster: "I just came over here to 
make a call and here I am talking to you. Thank the Lord or whoever you thank. 
I've never been through a plane crash in 35 years or 3,500 hours of flying my 
own, so I'm amazed."

SOVIET STRIKERS WARNED AGAINST RAIL SHUTDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
GORBACHEV SAYS WIDER ACTION IS 'THE WRONG WAY,' HINTS OF NEW MEASURES TO 
CONTROL UNREST 
</P>

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned Wednesday that a threatened 
spillover of coal strikes to the railroads could have "very far-reaching 
economic, social and political consequences" and could force the Kremlin to 
consider new ways "to prevent the situation from getting out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's unscheduled remarks before the Soviet Parliament constituted the 
most ominous official reaction since labor unrest erupted 10 days ago in the 
Kuznets Basin of Siberia. They were interpreted here as a signal of growing 
government alarm over what at first were depicted as justifiable protests. 
</P>
<P>
Referring twice to previously unreported calls for railway workers to join the 
coal strike Aug. 1, Gorbachev said: "We must declare this with full 
responsibility before the entire people, we must tell them, 'This is not the 
road! This is the wrong way!' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Railways Are Vital 
</P>
<P>
Given the Soviet Union's vast distances and underdeveloped highway system, 
railroads are an extraordinarily vital economic link. They carry about 80% of 
the country's freight and the greater part of its inter-city travelers. A 
widespread rail strike could quickly cripple the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that we must keep a cool head but not rest complacent or 
inactive" in the face of the rail threat, Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government efforts to appease the striking coal miners apparently 
were having mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television reported Wednesday night that about 24,000 Siberian miners 
had gone back to work after being urged by strike committee leaders to accept 
pledges of higher pay, improved food supplies and more financial autonomy at 
their mines. However, it said, 150,000 others remained on strike. 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai A. Artinov, a dispatcher at a Kemerovo coal combine that earlier in the 
day was idle, said in a telephone interview that four mines resumed operations 
with the midnight shift and that workers at nine others were scheduled to be 
back on the job by 9 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a related strike in the Donets Basin of the Ukraine apparently was 
growing. This strike, which began over the weekend at eight mines, had by 
Wednesday closed 70 of the region's 120 mines, according to the main evening 
television news. 
</P>
<P>
A special high-level government commission has been negotiating with the 
Siberian miners, and Gorbachev disclosed Wednesday that he had sent a telegram 
the night before promising the Donets miners equal treatment. However, the 
Soviet leader acknowledged that "I understand from the information I got this 
morning that there are still differences." 
</P>
<P>
The somber tone of Gorbachev's remarks contrasted sharply with the authorities' 
initial reaction to the Siberian strikes. Nikolai N. Slyunkov, a member of the 
Communist Party's ruling Politburo, who was sent to the Kuznets Basin to deal 
with the situation, quickly capitulated to several of the strikers' demands and 
even praised the miners for their "high civic consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure From Below 
</P>
<P>
The strikers were seen as having responded to Gorbachev's call for pressure 
from below to implement his program of reforms known as perestroika. The 
miners' call for greater local autonomy appeared to mesh with Gorbachev's 
efforts to decentralize the system -- efforts that he says are being frustrated 
by a stubborn layer of party and government bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
At first the reformers may have quietly welcomed the strikes, but a Western 
analyst said Wednesday that "I think in the last 36 hours, they have become 
somewhat more alarmed as this has spread" from Siberia to the European part of 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread media coverage of the miners' demands and of official concessions 
could encourage a spread of strike fever. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, workers all over have the same grievances as these guys -- shortages 
of food, poor housing, a rising cost of living, unresponsive local officials," 
the Western analyst said. "Those grievances are almost universal here." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the miners' complaints can be dealt with quickly, but there appears to 
be no easy solution for the others. Gorbachev said it will take at least a 
month to study all their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Polluted Cities 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Moscow News reported that Kemerovo and Novokuznetsk are among 
the 10 most polluted cities in the world. Life expectancy in the Siberian coal 
region, it said, is 10 years below the national average. 
</P>
<P>
The mining town of Yenakiyevo in the Ukraine has running water only two hours a 
day, Soviet television said. Such problems are not likely to be solved soon. 
</P>
<P>
The workers, meanwhile, have been far less compliant than in some past labor 
actions. Local officials in Prokopyevsk, one of the centers of the Kuznets 
Basin unrest, quickly arranged for supplies of instant coffee, candy and 
fashionable clothing to go on sale on the second day of the strike. But 
according to the Moscow News, the local strike committee immediately stopped 
the sales, saying, "We don't want handouts." 
</P>
<P>
Officials here are also concerned about the coal strikes being used for purely 
political ends. 
</P>
<P>
"There are already people in Kemerovo who are urging miners to put an end to 
communism and socialism," Gorbachev told members of Parliament. "Emissaries 
appeared who want to see if it's possible to merge their extremist, 
anti-socialist slogans with those raised by the workers, and to cash in on the 
workers' dissatisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that while workers' concerns should be heard, "even in the 
sharpest form, one should realize that the pressing problems can be solved only 
along the road of perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, while focusing more on the danger of the strikes getting out of 
control, also repeated his criticism of local party and government officials 
who are undermining his reforms in the mining regions and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, he had singled out the official trade union organization for 
criticism, and there was some speculation here that it may be headed for a 
shake-up. 
</P>

"Gorbachev in the past has used these crises to his own advantage and to 
advance the long-term reform goals that he has promoted," the Western analyst 
said. "He may be getting ready to point the finger at the trade union movement, 
which has been lukewarm about perestroika from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
The trade unions are headed by Stepan A. Shalaev, 60, one of the few remaining 
holdovers from the era of the late and now-discredited Soviet leader Leonid I. 
Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RARE LABOR UNREST 
</P>
<P>
The labor strike is not a new phenomenon in the Soviet Union, but for a long 
time it has been a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
Trade unions were organized after the revolution of 1905, and strikes were 
commonplace for much of the next two decades. The Bolsheviks, who established 
the Soviet Union after the revolution of 1917, virtually outlawed strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Soviet system, trade unions were transformed into an instrument of 
the Communist Party. Their role has been to enforce worker discipline, 
administer welfare plans and work for the achievement of the government's 
economic goals. 
</P>
<P>
There have been unpublicized strikes off and on during the postwar period. One 
of the most serious was in 1962 at Novocherkassk in southern Russia, when 
troops shot scores of workers to death while putting down protests against food 
price increases. In 1988, there were widespread strikes in the autonomous 
region of Nagorno-Karabakh, spurred by ethnic conflict between Armenians and 
Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
The strikes now sweeping Soviet coal mines are regarded as particularly 
significant because they were triggered for the most part by social welfare 
issues.

'UNCONSCIOUS' FLIER MOVED HEAD, TRACKING PILOTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Military pilots who tracked Washington lawyer Thomas Root's plane during its 
bizarre six-hour flight last Thursday saw Root turn his head several times, 
which could cast doubt on his statements that he was unconscious during most of 
the flight, federal investigators announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Various pilots reported that, as he was intercepted from the right, his head 
would turn to the right, and, as he was intercepted from the left, his head 
would move to the left," National Transportation Safety Board official Andrew 
Alston said. "The sun visor moved position at least three times during the 
flight." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Alston said, a toxicology report showed no sign of elevated levels 
of carbon monoxide in Root's blood, virtually ruling out an earlier theory that 
he had lost consciousness from carbon monoxide poisoning. And aviation experts 
have discounted the theory that he may have suffered oxygen deprivation at the 
altitude he was flying, 10,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators confronted Root Wednesday morning with the conflicts between his 
statements and the evidence, Alston said, but Root offered no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Root's strange flight focused attention on his business dealings with a Georgia 
firm, Sonrise Management Services Inc., which recruited investors for FM radio 
license applications. Root represented the applicants before the Federal 
Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the applications were successful, and the firm's operations are now 
under investigation by state and federal regulatory officials. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Sonrise shifted blame to Root, filing suit in federal District Court 
here charging that Root had violated his contract with Sonrise to represent 
investors and had improperly handled client funds placed in his law firm's 
escrow account. The suit seeks nearly $600,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$15 Million Invested 
</P>
<P>
Investors have placed $15 million or more into the partnerships that the 
company organized to seek radio station licenses. To date, efforts by FCC 
officials to obtain information about those dealings have largely been 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Root's plane went off course Thursday when he was flying from Washington to 
Rocky Mount, N.C., for a legal proceeding. Military pilots who tracked the 
flight watched the plane for hours as it flew south, with Root slumped back in 
his seat, until the plane apparently ran out of fuel and plunged into the ocean 
14 miles from the Bahamian Island of Eleuthera. 
</P>
<P>
As the plane sank, rescuers were stunned to see Root swim away from the 
wreckage. The oddity of the flight deepened when it was discovered at a 
Hollywood, Fla., hospital to which Root had been taken for treatment that he 
had suffered a gunshot wound in the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials said that the gunshot appeared to be self-inflicted, a 
suggestion that Root and his relatives have strenuously denied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accidental Firing Discounted 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., which manufactured the revolver that 
Root was carrying in his plane, have denied that the impact of the plane's 
hitting the water could have caused the gun to fire, as Root's relatives have 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"Any suggestion that our revolver will fire without trigger contact is 
absolutely false," Smith &amp; Wesson Vice President Dick Backman said 
Wednesday. The gun "can be dropped on concrete" and will not go off unless 
someone pulls the trigger, Backman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Safety Issues Found 
</P>
<P>
With no plans to retrieve the sunken plane and weapon, the mystery of Root's 
flight may not be solved. The NTSB "has not identified any aviation safety 
issues" in Root's flight, a spokeswoman said Wednesday, and is hoping to "wind 
down" its safety investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI will continue to investigate the flight to see if any federal laws were 
broken, but, so far, little evidence of that has emerged. Wednesday, a 
spokesman for William J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of Drug 
Control Policy, denied reports that a federal drug task force had been 
investigating Root. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory reports on whether Root had drugs or alcohol in his system are 
likely to be released later this week or early next week, the NTSB said.

JET CARRYING 293 CRASHES, BURNS IN IOWA; 166 SURVIVE

SIOUX CITY, Iowa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A crippled United Airlines DC-10 crashed a half-mile short of a runway while 
trying to make an emergency landing Wednesday afternoon, bursting into a 
cartwheeling fireball that broke into what one eyewitness described as "15,000 
pieces" and killing at least 123 of the 293 passengers and crew members on 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, as many as 166 persons survived the violent crash, according to 
Richard Vohs, a spokesman for Iowa Gov. Terry E. Branstad. The fate of four 
others was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tail Engine Explodes 
</P>
<P>
The plane's tail engine exploded before the crash but it was not immediately 
clear how the explosion contributed to what a Federal Aviation Administration 
spokesman called "complete hydraulic failure," an occurrence regarded as 
extremely rare in the wide-bodied DC-10, which has three independent hydraulic 
systems that operate all the plane's control surfaces on its wings and tail, 
and landing gear and brakes. 
</P>
<P>
As rescuers worked underneath floodlights to remove bodies from the crash site, 
original estimates of the death toll -- one as high as 190, which would have 
made the crash the second worst in U.S. history -- were reduced. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a firm count" of the dead, Vohs acknowledged at a press 
conference seven hours after the crash. "But right now, the number (of 
survivors) confirmed is 166." 
</P>
<P>
The survivors of Wednesday's United Flight 232 from Denver to Philadelphia via 
Chicago included several dozen passengers who managed to walk out of a dark, 
smoke-filled, upside-down section of the jet after it broke off and came to 
rest in a tall cornfield off the runway. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked out (through the back of the plane) and found myself in the 
cornfield," passenger David Landsberger told Cable News Network. "We were all 
walking around in shock. I just walked through it like it was a dream. I was a 
little dazed." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the goddamndest thing I ever saw in my life," said Charles Mertz of 
Castle Rock, Colo., another of those who walked away. 
</P>
<P>
Suitcases, paper, mail, clothes, chunks of burning metal and bodies were strewn 
over the inactive runway at Sioux Gateway Airport, where the plane crashed 
after desperately circling for a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
One hundred ambulances, fire trucks and helicopters from as far away as South 
Dakota plucked out the victims. The search for bodies was difficult because 
some of them were scattered in the cornfield. Many of the survivors were listed 
in critical condition with burns or broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
United Airlines declined to comment on the number of survivors or to release 
the names of the 282 passengers and 11 crew members. 
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said pieces of the 15-year-old airplane -- one of the oldest 
airliners in United's fleet -- were falling off as far as 75 miles from the 
site of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
A team of National Transportation Safety Board investigators left Washington 
Wednesday night for Sioux City. 
</P>
<P>
The hydraulic system that disintegrated Wednesday works the same way a power 
steering system operates in a car. By forcing liquid through a tube, the system 
provides enough power for a pilot to move an airliner's huge tail rudder and 
elevators, and wing panels known as flaps and ailerons -- all needed to steer 
an aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Some aviation experts, speculating on why Flight 232 crashed after completing 
less than half of its scheduled 930-mile trip to Chicago, suggested that the 
explosion of the tail engine sent shards of metal through the tail section, 
somehow destroying common lines that serve the three hydraulic systems. 
</P>
<P>
There were reports from passengers and observers that the plane's right-wing 
engine also failed before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
In what survivors described as a heroic effort that nearly succeeded, the 
plane's Seattle-based captain, A. C. Haynes -- a 33-year veteran of the airline 
who along with the other 10 crew members survived the crash -- struggled for a 
half-hour to maintain control of the wobbling plane. Radio transmission 
indicated the plane's maneuverability was limited to right-hand turns. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Haynes attempted a landing on Highway 20 near Cushing, Iowa, but 
chose not to touch down there in favor of trying to make Sioux City, a farming 
and livestock center of 82,000 in the northwest corner of Iowa along the 
Missouri River. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preparing for Crash Landing 
</P>
<P>
"Then they said we were preparing for a crash landing. They said it would be 
about 30 seconds, but it was about five minutes," another passenger said. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes brought the plane into the airport's 9,000-foot-long southwest runway, 
surrounded by corn, soybeans and pasture with some trees seven miles outside 
downtown Sioux City. 
</P>
<P>
At about 4 p.m. CDT, the plane made its final approach. 
</P>
<P>
Onlookers watched hopefully. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was going to make it," said Glen Olson, city editor of the Sioux 
City Journal. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before touchdown the plane's right wing began to dip and the nose began 
to fall. 
</P>
<P>
The wing hit the ground a half-mile before the runway. The impact caused the 
aircraft to turn over several times as it slid down the runway, "breaking up 
very badly," catching on fire and then exploding, according to Bob Raynesford, 
an FAA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it turned over a couple of times. I think it landed upside down," said 
passenger Melanie Cincala of Toledo, Ohio, who said the plane burst into flames 
after she got off. 
</P>
<P>
A large piece of the fuselage barreled onto the runway. Huge clouds of smoke 
and flames billowed upward as firemen sprayed foam over the wreckage. Rescue 
helicopters hovered overhead. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting there upside down and it began to fill up with smoke," said 
Cliff Marshall of Columbus, Ohio, who was returning home from Denver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Push Little Girl Out' 
</P>
<P>
"Then God opened a hole in the basement (the bottom of the plane) and I pushed 
a little girl out. I grabbed another, kept pulling them out until they didn't 
come no more." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said he thought he helped a half-dozen out and then he ran. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Romaine Bendixen, clinic commander of Iowa National Guard's 185th tactical 
fighter group, said he was the first doctor on the scene, about three minutes 
after the crash. He had just landed in another plane. 
</P>
<P>
He said the living were scattered among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
"In one group of six seats, a woman sitting in the middle was barely injured, 
her husband beside her was dead and two behind her were dead," Bendixen said. 
</P>
<P>
He said rescuers pulled out three of the flight crew alive. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt Graham, manager of Graham Flying Service, a charter service and 
corporate aircraft maintenance firm that operates out of the building closest 
to the crash site, said he was in his office, answering phones, when five crash 
victims -- a man, his wife and young son and two other men -- walked in. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing. They were in remarkably good shape. From looking at one or two 
of them you wouldn't know they were in the accident," Graham said. Their 
clothes were clean, not mussed, their hair was in place and they had no 
scratches he could see, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survival Rate Remarkable 
</P>
<P>
C. O. Miller, former chief investigator for the National Transportation Safety 
Board, said the crash's survival rate was remarkable and was probably the 
result of the pilot's ability to maneuver the plane close to the ground before 
losing complete control. 
</P>
<P>
"If an airplane cartwheels, it is very fortuitous that anybody got out," said 
Miller, now a private aviation safety consultant in Sidona, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
He said the huge mass of the DC-10 must have helped the pilot slow the plane as 
it approached the ground and helped keep portions of it intact. He said a 
smaller plane, such as a DC-9, would have been far more likely to break up more 
severely. 
</P>
<P>
St. Luke's Regional Medical Center said 80 to 90 crash victims had been 
admitted and of those 70 were expected to leave the hospital Wednesday night. A 
spokesman said they sustained light injuries. About 50 survivors were housed 
overnight at Briarcliff College. 
</P>
<P>
Lavonne Quirin of Alta, in Buena Vista County, 75 miles from the airport, said 
she and her husband found a cone-shaped section of the plane in a cornfield at 
their seed corn business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Size of a Car' 
</P>
<P>
"It's about the size of a car," she said. She said no one at the farm saw or 
heard the object fall. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Corp., which builds the DC-10, said the plane was delivered 
to United in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
United, the nation's second largest airline, has one of the oldest fleets in 
the industry. The average age of its aircraft is 13.5 years. The average for 
the entire industry is 11.7 years. 
</P>
<P>
No unusual weather was reported. Wind speeds were clocked up to 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
A DC-10 was involved in the nation's worst air crash 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
On May 25, 1979, American Airlines Flight 191 lost an engine on takeoff, banked 
sideways out of control, slammed into a field and exploded. All 258 passengers 
and 13 crew members died, as well as two people on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board cited "maintenance-induced damage" -- 
a 10-inch crack in the engine mount -- that caused the left engine to tear 
loose. The NTSB also criticized McDonnell Douglas' design as vulnerable to 
maintenance damage. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas suspended production of the DC-10 airliner in 1983. DC-10 
orders collapsed in 1979 because of the recession and the May, 1979, crash. In 
all, 369 DC-10s were produced. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's tragedy was the worst in a recent series of accidents and mishaps 
involving United. 
</P>
<P>
Nine persons were hurled to their deaths last Feb. 24 when a cargo door popped 
open in flight, tearing a gaping hole in a United Boeing 747 jetliner. The 
cause of that accident, which took place over the Pacific near Hawaii, is under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turns Up Deficiencies 
</P>
<P>
The accident probe has turned up deficiencies in United's procedures regarding 
the cargo doors. The airline told NTSB investigators that it had "somehow 
overlooked" an FAA recommendation to inspect the cargo door latch locks each 
time the door is closed manually, rather than electrically. 
</P>
<P>
On July 10, a United Boeing 747 was forced to make an emergency landing at 
Miami International Airport after the plane was damaged in heavy turbulence 
over the Florida-Georgia border. None of the airliner's 108 passengers were 
injured. On Tuesday, a United DC-10 with 249 people aboard slid 300 yards on 
the runway after landing at rain-soaked O'Hare International Airport in Chicago 
but there were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Last Dec. 23, a United DC-10 bound for Chicago with 287 passengers had engine 
problems after takeoff and dumped 52,000 gallons of fuel over the Pacific 
before returning safely to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The second-worst crash in U.S. history was an Aug. 16, 1987, crash that killed 
156 people when a Northwest Airlines jet crashed on takeoff at Detroit 
Metropolitan Airport. One child on the plane survived.

Leading opposition figure Aung San Suu Kyi called off a planned march in the 
capital of Myanmar, formerly Burma, fearing bloodshed after the military 
government poured thousands of heavily armed troops into the streets. "We had 
no intention of leading our people straight into a killing field," she said by 
telephone from Yangon (formerly Rangoon). At least 20 young people were 
arrested and many beaten in scattered clashes across the city.

Two drug kingpins lived in luxury in a crowded Mexico City prison, taking up 
enough space for 250 inmates and filling their opulent quarters with jewels, 
guns and cash, officials said. The two, Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto 
Fonseca Carrillo, are among those charged in the 1985 slaying of U.S. drug 
agent Enrique S. Camarena. A pool table, an aquarium, Turkish baths, video 
equipment, a television, fruit trees, telephone and radio equipment and even 
fighting roosters were found inside the quarters after the two were transferred 
recently to a high-security section, Alfonso Cabrera Morales, city prisons 
director, said. Cabrera Morales, who became prisons director four months ago, 
said the plush life style was uncovered during an investigation of prison 
corruption.

There were nearly 19 million licensed drivers in California last year, about 
360,000 more than the year before, the state Department of Motor Vehicles 
reported. The agency said there were 18,934,147 licensed motorists in the state 
for the period ending Dec. 31, 1988, roughly a 2% increase over 1987. The DMV 
also said that nearly 24.7 million vehicles were registered in California 
during 1988, including about 16.3 million passenger cars. The year before, 
about 23.1 million vehicles were registered, about 15.6 million of them 
passenger cars. The figures represented the most recent period for which 
statistics were available.

Federal prosecutors in Savannah, Ga., rested their case against a Turk accused 
in a plot by an Army officer to sell U.S. military secrets to the Soviet bloc. 
Defense attorney Lamar Walter was expected to call the defendant, Huseyin 
Yildirim, 61, to the stand to explain his relationship with former Army Warrant 
Officer James W. Hall II, who is serving 40 years in prison after pleading 
guilty to nine counts of espionage. Yildirim is accused of acting as a courier 
between Hall and agents for East Germany, beginning in 1982.

Britain and Vietnam have agreed secretly to force thousands of Vietnamese 
refugees in Hong Kong to return home, British news reports said. The Guardian 
newspaper said the agreement was confirmed by unidentified government officials 
in London and in Hong Kong; however, neither the British Foreign Office nor 
Hong Kong authorities would comment. The newspaper said those to be repatriated 
have been classified as economic rather than political refugees and that more 
than half the 50,000 in Hong Kong are likely to be sent back home. It said 
repatriations may start in a week. The British Broadcasting Corp. said the 
agreement has been kept secret to avoid provoking unrest among refugees in the 
British colony.

San Francisco police broke up a group of people burning the American flag 
outside a hotel where Vice President Dan Quayle was speaking. Three were 
arrested after about 20 helmeted officers armed with billy clubs moved against 
the group blocking an intersection near the Fairmont Hotel. Also on hand were 
about 200 anti-Quayle demonstrators protesting U.S. policies in Central 
America. Only a small group was involved in the burning of the flag, which 
police said appeared to have been stolen from the nearby Mark Hopkins Hotel. 
One person was charged with theft of a flag and the two others with assault on 
a police officer. Police also arrested photographer Pete DaSilva, on assignment 
for the Associated Press, charging him with battery on a police officer. City 
Supervisor Jim Gonzales, one of the peaceful demonstrators, told reporters: "I 
hope Quayle and his friends stop their orgy of sending dollars to Central 
America for military aid. It hurts cities like San Francisco that are trying to 
battle the AIDS and crack epidemics."

The Greek government said that Washington must dismantle U.S. bases in Greece 
next year without a new defense pact. Talks on a new agreement have been 
frozen. A five-year agreement signed by the previous Socialist administration 
expired last year. "The issue of the U.S. bases in Greece is frozen . . . but 
the 17-month countdown which began last December for the Americans to remove 
the bases if a new agreement was not signed is still in force," said Deputy 
Foreign Minister George Papoulias.

The House Ethics Committee was asked Wednesday to investigate charges that Rep. 
Gus Savage (D-Ill.) sexually assaulted a Peace Corps volunteer while on an 
official trip to Zaire last March. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Savage's Democratic colleagues -- Reps. Patricia Schroeder of 
Colorado, Matthew F. McHugh of New York and Barney Frank of Massachusetts -- 
requested the ethics investigation, which means the congressional panel must 
inquire into the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the accusation is sufficiently serious to justify your looking 
into it," the lawmakers said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Peace Corps also said they were willing to seek disciplinary 
action against the Chicago Democrat but would not do so without the woman's 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball is in her court," said one agency official, who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The Peace Corps worker, who has not been identified, claims that Savage 
repeatedly fondled her -- despite her protests -- for more than two hours in 
the back of a chauffeur-driven embassy car in Kinshasa, the capital of Zaire, 
on March 19, according to several government officials who confirmed an account 
originally published in the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
Savage denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in a caravan of four or five cars," he told reporters from Chicago 
television stations. "We made four or five brief stops and got out of the car 
and got back in. If there were any kind of abuse, then why would she keep 
getting back into the same car?"

SOVIETS REPORTED PHASING OUT OLDER WARHEADS 
</P>

<P>
The Soviet Union possesses about 33,000 nuclear weapons, 40% more than the 
United States, but it is rapidly phasing out old warheads much as this nation 
did 20 years ago when its stockpile was that large, the private, 
pro-disarmament Natural Resources Defense Council reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The two superpowers now have about equal numbers of warheads and bombs -- some 
13,000 each -- on long-range weapons. The Soviets have twice as many 
shorter-range nuclear systems. However, some of these are being discontinued, 
or their nuclear explosives are being replaced with conventional explosives, 
the council said. 
</P>
<P>
The data was presented in the council's 433-page "Soviet Nuclear Weapon 
Databook," which it described as the first comprehensive tally and analysis of 
the Soviet stockpile. The report declared that the Soviets have slowed efforts 
to modernize their nuclear arsenal and implicitly called on the United States 
to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually every category of Soviet nuclear weapons has seen reductions over 
the last two years," said William M. Arkin, one of the authors of the report. 
He complained that the Reagan and Bush administrations have been overly 
conservative in assessing the Soviet scale-down moves. 
</P>
<P>
Two new Soviet intercontinental missiles, the SS-24 and SS-25, are being 
introduced only "sluggishly," the council said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the databook's chief findings: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Of the Soviets' 33,000 nuclear weapons, 4,100 are strategic defense weapons 
(mostly anti-aircraft missiles), 11,300 are short-range land-based weapons such 
as tactical bombs and artillery shells, and 3,500 are short-range naval weapons 
such as torpedoes. In comparison, the United States has essentially no nuclear 
air defense weapons, 7,000 land-based weapons and 3,000 naval weapons, 
according to Robert S. Norris, another co-author of the report. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Soviets have many more types of nuclear weapons than the United States, 
including 18 kinds of ballistic missiles, compared to seven U.S. models, and 16 
kinds of anti-ship missiles, compared to four U.S. models. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Soviets have 2 1/2 times more explosive power in their nuclear weapons 
than the United States -- some 12,000 megatons (one megaton equals 1 million 
tons of TNT), compared to 4,500 megatons for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two Soviet long-range sea-launched cruise missiles are still not 
operationally deployed, despite U.S. intelligence estimates to the contrary.

JARUZELSKI SWORN IN AS POLISH PRESIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNIST PARTY LEADER WINS POST WITHOUT A VOTE TO SPARE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Communist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski was sworn in as Poland's new 
president Wednesday night after winning election in the National Assembly 
without a single vote to spare. 
</P>
<P>
"I accept," Gen. Jaruzelski said upon arriving before the packed chamber to be 
officially informed of the result. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be a president of reconciliation, a representative of all Poles," he 
said, without referring to the narrowness of the victory or the last swipe 
taken by the opposition, which took pains to put on record that Jaruzelski had 
won the minimum number of votes necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 270 for Jaruzelski, 233 against and 34 abstaining. With a total of 
537 valid votes cast, the lawmakers initially declared that 269 were required 
to win. After some debate, led by opposition Solidarity lawmakers, the assembly 
voted to declare that 270 votes was the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trace of Malice 
</P>
<P>
This numerical fine-tuning had more than a trace of malice in it. But to 
Solidarity members and many Poles who watched the eight-hour procedure on 
television, it was a last protest against Jaruzelski and the current hybrid 
political system -- almost free, but not quite -- that presented only one 
choice to lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who abstained, in fact, announced that they were withholding 
their votes as a protest against an election with just one candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly, composed of the Sejm and the newly created Senate, spent 
nearly two hours on a series of motions to decide whether the vote would be 
taken by secret ballot or an open roll call. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sinking in procedural matters," argued one lawmaker, trying to sort out 
the welter of overlapping motions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting a bit chaotic," agreed Sejm Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, a compromise was reached in which the lawmakers marked ballots that 
were dropped, one by one, in a box on the rostrum as the names were called. The 
votes of individual members, it was agreed, are to be published. (In one motion 
before the floor, only the leaders of the various parties would be informed as 
to how members voted, which prompted Solidarity activist Adam Michnik to 
comment that such a provision would not prevent the "secret police from knowing 
how we voted.") 
</P>
<P>
Given the closeness of the vote, an open roll call would have provided millions 
of television viewers with one of the most dramatic spectacles in Polish 
political history -- and might well have altered the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riveting Theater 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it was riveting theater, as television cameras hovered over the table 
where parliamentary secretaries counted, sorted, stacked and then recounted the 
ballots. Dozens of newly elected senators and Sejm deputies crowded at the 
rostrum rail over the counting table, watching the tally. 
</P>
<P>
"I state that citizen Wojciech Jaruzelski has received the required number of 
votes and has been elected by the National Assembly to be president of the 
Polish People's Republic," Kozakiewicz said after the count was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Kozakiewicz and Senate Speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski then went to Jaruzelski's 
office to escort him to the National Assembly building. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski, 66, in a blue suit and his familiar tinted glasses, made a low-key 
speech, noting that the nation had embarked on a "crucial period of change" and 
that "the attention of the world is focused on Poland." 
</P>
<P>
"We face great demands and tasks," he said. "We must rebuild our economy. We 
have to assemble a new political order." 
</P>
<P>
He concluded: "I will serve the nation. I will serve the fatherland, the one 
that has not perished, the one that is and will be." 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski's election came after nearly three weeks of uncertainty. On June 30, 
after it appeared that some of the Communist coalition's partners were hesitant 
in their support, he withdrew from the race, saying that most of the public 
identified him more with the 1981 imposition of martial law and the suppression 
of Solidarity than with the government's reform track over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
However, the party's rank and file quickly realized after Jaruzelski's 
withdrawal that it had no acceptable alternative. After two weeks of hard 
consideration and political arm twisting, the Communist allies in the Peasants' 
Party and the Democratic Party somewhat reluctantly came along. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Jaruzelski's close scrape in the election was not foreseen in April, 
when "round-table" agreements were concluded between Solidarity and the 
government. Although it was not a formal part of the arrangement, the labor 
union and the government side agreed that Jaruzelski would be president. The 
threat to that arrangement came from the party's once-reliable friends, 
urgently looking for a way out of what they perceive as a sinking political 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
With his stern face and erect military bearing, Jaruzelski projects an air of 
strong pride, reflected in an interview last month in which he declared that "I 
will not crawl for this job." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, he did campaign for the presidency within the political 
parties of the Sejm, even meeting Tuesday with the Solidarity delegation for 
six grueling hours of questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those questions centered on the martial-law declaration and the 
accompanying arrests and crackdown on civil liberties. And the overwhelming 
majority of the Solidarity delegation is equally critical about Jaruzelski's 
leadership in the years since, during which, it is argued, Poland's economic 
slide continued unabated. 
</P>
<P>
For Jaruzelski, the presidency is the culmination of his career and offers a 
chance for him to enter Polish history as a figure more positive than the 
commissar of martial law, a step that his supporters contend saved the nation 
from a Soviet invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski's first order of business will be to appoint a prime minister, who 
will then put together Poland's next government. Speculation has centered on 
Wladislaw Baka, a Politburo member and party economic specialist. Political 
observers say the government is likely to rely more than ever on technocratic 
experts, rather than political figures. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski is also expected to resign his post as party leader, thereby 
establishing the principle that the head of state and the top post in the 
Communist Party should be separated.

The Senate voted Wednesday to name a grassy plot near the Chinese Embassy in 
Washington "Tian An Men Square Park" in honor of pro-democracy demonstrators in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to memorializing demonstrators who were killed by the Chinese army, 
said the bill's sponsor, Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.), the action serves "to 
remind Beijing that America will never and can never forget the ruthlessness 
and callousness of the Chinese government in crushing their 
citizen-demonstrators and their aspirations." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal expresses the sense of Congress that a statue should be 
constructed to honor the fallen students. 
</P>

The amendment was added by voice vote to a bill authorizing State Department 
programs for the new budget year.

The mother of a junior high school student has been sentenced to 10 days in 
jail for allowing her daughter to miss 101 days of school last year. 
</P>
<P>
After sentencing Debra Shaw to the maximum jail time Tuesday, District Judge 
David W. Young instructed a jailer to give the woman's two children a tour of 
the courthouse holding cells. 
</P>
<P>
"Your mother is going to the dirty, funky, stinky Baltimore City Jail because 
the two of you have played hooky," Young said. He blamed the children's truancy 
on their mother's laziness, noting that she had failed to show up for several 
meetings with school officials before charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw was convicted on a charge of failing to send 14-year-old Shantres Shaw to 
school. Young said he had information that Shantres' brother, James, 13, missed 
a similar number of days.

HORROR STORIES OF WAR IN AFGHANISTAN RELATED BY SOVIET VETERANS

<P>
A Soviet newspaper this week published two Soviet veterans' accounts of Red 
Army soldiers beating prisoners, trading submachine guns for Soviet turncoats 
and barely surviving attacks by their own helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
The daring weekly Moscow News carried the war stories by Valery Abramov and 
Ruslan Umiyev under the headline, "The Whole Truth has to be Told About this 
War!" 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, the Soviet press has questioned the leadership's decision 
to invade Afghanistan in 1979, but it stayed away from criticizing how the war 
itself was run. 
</P>
<P>
Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov came under public and official attack 
at the Congress of People's Deputies last month for claiming that Soviet pilots 
were ordered to kill Soviet soldiers who were likely to be captured by Afghan 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Abramov told Moscow News that Sakharov's claim that Soviet soldiers killed each 
other could have been based on a confused firefight he witnessed in June, 1980, 
in Faizabad. 
</P>
<P>
"The guerrillas' fire was driving us into the ground. Suddenly, our helicopters 
appeared and started to strafe our own battalions," Abramov wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"It was some kind of hell," he said. The shooting stopped, he said, after 
officers apparently understood their mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Umiyev, who served in Afghanistan from 1985 to 1987, said he, too, saw Soviet 
fliers mistakenly attack their own troops, adding: "It was quite a mess there. 
Why should we be silent about it?" 
</P>
<P>
Recounting "incidents that are shameful to recall," Abramov described how two 
Afghan prisoners suspected of being guerrillas were brought into his camp. 
</P>
<P>
"We already had people killed and missing," he said. "Lost friends . . . and we 
unleashed all our accumulated pain on those two. We beat them all night, with 
short breaks. I, too, tried to beat them as painfully as I could. It seemed as 
if they were to blame for the deaths of our soldiers. And in the morning, it 
turned out they were peaceful inhabitants who had never participated in any 
battles." 
</P>
<P>
Umiyev told Moscow News the official silence should also be broken about all 
the Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan who went over to the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet units often would exchange three guerrillas or 10 submachine guns for 
the chance to get their hands on such turncoats, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His unit traded for one such soldier who reportedly had served six years as a 
grenade launcher with the guerrillas, Umiyev said. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried him right on the square," he said. "Anyone could ask him questions. 
He was silent and cried. They gave him eight years. We were all mad that they 
gave him so little."

Frederik W. de Klerk, who is expected to be South Africa's next president, 
Wednesday bowed to anti-apartheid pressure and turned down an invitation by 
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III to visit the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha in 
Pretoria. De Klerk was in Mozambique on Wednesday for talks with the government 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that elements within the American Congress are intent on making the 
visit as controversial as possible," Botha said in a statement, adding that De 
Klerk "would like to avoid creating any obstacles to constructive discussion" 
by undertaking the trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter From Congress 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 members of the House of Representatives asked President Bush in a 
letter released Tuesday not to meet De Klerk unless South Africa relaxes its 
apartheid policies of racial separation and white minority rule and ends its 
three-year-old state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"To meet with the National Party leader and anticipated president of South 
Africa without any significant political change by the white minority regime 
would send a terribly wrong signal concerning the direction of U.S. policy 
during the Bush Administration," the letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
No dates had been announced for the trip, but it had been expected that De 
Klerk would head for the United States toward the end of the month. He accepted 
a general invitation to visit Washington after Baker met with South African 
President Pieter W. Botha last May in Rome.

FEAR OF FLYING: HYDRAULIC LOSS IS ONE OF WORST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The "complete hydraulic failure" reported by the pilot of doomed United 
Airlines Flight 232 is one of the most feared events in flying, rendering even 
a sophisticated three-engine jet like the DC-10 virtually uncontrollable. 
</P>
<P>
The wide-bodied DC-10 has three independent hydraulic systems that operate all 
the plane's control surfaces on its wings and tail, its landing gear and its 
brakes. 
</P>
<P>
A failure of all three hydraulic systems is "rare, rare, rare," said John 
Gallipault, director of the private Aviation Safety Institute in Worthington, 
Ohio. "Design engineers calculate that to happen something like once every 300 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Gallipault, like several other aviation experts interviewed, cautioned that 
preliminary reports on air crashes are almost invariably incomplete or marred 
by errors and said that other factors likely would emerge as contributing to 
the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manufacturer's Warning 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft's manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas Corp., warns pilots that failure 
of even one hydraulic system can lead to disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"Careful consideration should be given to continuation of a flight after loss 
of a single hydraulic system, keeping in mind that subsequent loss of a second 
system -- through system or engine failure -- may create a serious emergency 
situation," the operating manual for the DC-10 says. 
</P>
<P>
According to one unidentified survivor of the crash, the pilot told passengers 
that "one of our engines had blown and quit. He said when it blew it hurt the 
tail of the plane and the pilots couldn't control the plane." 
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman John Leyden said the pilot reported 
"uncontained failure" of the jet's No. 2 engine, in the plane's tail, meaning 
that the engine blew apart and sent shards of metal through the tail section, 
where several critical hydraulic components are housed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduces Control 
</P>
<P>
According to the DC-10 manual, loss of the hydraulic system driven by the tail 
engine would render the lower half of the rudder inoperative, making steering 
difficult. It also would reduce control of the flaps at the rear surface of the 
wings, making it hard for the pilot to slow the big jet for a safe landing. 
</P>
<P>
But backup systems operating off the two wing-mounted engines should have made 
the plane flyable, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
A civil aviation expert who asked not to be named theorized that the No. 2 
engine failed "catastrophically" -- blowing apart and severing all the 
hydraulic lines in the tail of the plane. That would disable the entire 
steering rudder as well as the critical flaps in the horizontal stabilizer, 
which allow the pilot to raise or lower the jet's nose. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot could then use the two remaining wing engines to steer the plane and 
slow it with flaps and spoilers on the wings operated with hydraulic power 
provided by the two remaining engines, the expert, a former military transport 
pilot, said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Incredibly Tricky' 
</P>
<P>
But controlling the big airliner under those conditions is "incredibly tricky," 
he said, and the pilot may not have been able to raise the nose as he attempted 
to land. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a machine which is very difficult to get pointed to the right place," 
the expert said after hearing descriptions of the crash. "He came pretty close 
to getting it landed. But the plane may have rolled slightly on him, and he dug 
in a wing tip." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, also, that the main hydraulic fluid reservoir, also in the rear 
of the plane, was destroyed when the No. 2 engine blew, virtually assuring 
complete loss of all hydraulic power. 
</P>
<P>
"Complete hydraulic failure was something he radioed and demonstrated, too," 
Leyden, the FAA official, said. "But we can't speculate on exactly how much 
control he had or what happened up there. All we know is he had a very, very 
difficult time controlling the aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Power Steering Loss 
</P>
<P>
An Eastern Airlines pilot, who asked not to be named, said that losing a 
DC-10's hydraulic system would be similar to having the power steering go out 
in a car. A pilot in that situation, he said, would find it virtually 
impossible to control the direction of the aircraft and efforts to slow it for 
landing would be extremely sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
"If you see your hydraulic pressure tanks go to zero and the lights and buzzers 
going off, you have to stabilize the aircraft," said the pilot. "You don't do 
anything to destabilize the aircraft, like pulling back on the power. You try 
to maintain the normal flight and get all the time you can and look for a big 
runway with crash crews." 
</P>
<P>
After past DC-10 crashes, critics have said that design features of the plane 
have made it particularly vulnerable to catastrophic hydraulic failures. But 
McDonnell Douglas has said that design changes have solved those problems. 
</P>
<P>
Hydraulic system failures have been key elements in many of the worst air 
crashes of the past two decades. In most cases, the failure of some portion of 
the plane set off a series of events that burst hydraulic lines, causing the 
pilot to lose control of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
For example, on May 25, 1979, an American Airlines DC-10, the same type of 
plane involved in Wednesday's disaster, crashed on takeoff at Chicago's O'Hare 
Airport, killing 271 persons on the plane and two more on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators later determined that the crash was caused when an engine on the 
plane's left wing ripped loose, damaging hydraulic lines that controlled the 
left wing flaps. The plane lunged to the left and slammed into the ground 31 
seconds after leaving the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in August, 1985, in the worst single-plane accident in history, an 
aft bulkhead ruptured on a Japan Airlines 747 jumbo jet, releasing pressure 
that buckled other portions of the plane, severing hydraulic lines and causing 
the plane to go out of control and fly into a mountainside. All but four of 524 
persons on board died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accident Over Paris 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier DC-10 crash, in 1974, a Turkish Airlines DC-10 crashed killing 
346 persons on board after it lost a cargo door over Paris. The explosive 
decompression of the plane buckled the floor, rupturing key hydraulic systems, 
investigators later found. 
</P>
<P>
Hydraulic-system failures have also caused disastrous crashes for the 
military's high-technology aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 21, 1988, a $280-million Air Force B1-B bomber crashed after a large 
bird, probably a pelican, collided with the plane as it streaked through the 
air at 600 m.p.h. The collision ruptured a critical hydraulic line and set off 
a 3,000-degree fire, destroying the giant aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Later that same year, a Navy F-14A fighter jet crashed upside down near El 
Cajon after its crew had bailed out, seriously injuring three people on the 
ground. The two crewmen abandoned the plane after telling controllers that 
trouble with the jet's hydraulic system had caused them to lose control of wing 
flaps.

The worst disaster in U.S. aviation history occurred 10 years ago when an 
American Airlines DC-10 crashed on takeoff from O'Hare International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 191 lost an engine on May 25, 1979, banked sideways out of control and 
slammed into a nearby field, exploding into an inferno. The furrow plowed in 
the field by the jetliner's left wing is still visible. 
</P>
<P>
The jetliner was reduced to scattered debris. All 258 passengers and 13 crew 
members were killed, as well as two people on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"To this day, it's something that's hard to comprehend, how a big plane like 
that could disintegrate into little pieces," said Ray Devito of Mokena, who had 
driven his girlfriend to the airport to catch the ill-fated Los Angeles-bound 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
The crash Wednesday in Sioux City, Iowa, is the first major domestic accident 
involving a DC-10 since the Chicago disaster a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board laid the primary blame for the 1979 
crash on the airline, citing "maintenance-induced damage" -- a 10-inch crack in 
the engine mount -- that caused the left engine to tear loose. It also 
criticized McDonnell Douglas' design as vulnerable to maintenance damage. 
</P>
<P>
The safety board also said the Federal Aviation Administration had been remiss 
by not learning that a similar crack had recently been repaired in a 
Continental Airlines DC-10. 
</P>
<P>
Since the accident, the FAA has been "very specific about what has to be 
reported to us and what doesn't," spokesman Fred Farrar said last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Bendell, a spokeswoman for McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach, said the 
only change made in the DC-10 pylon design was a shift to flathead rather than 
raised-head bolts.

SIOUX CITY HAD ITS EMERGENCY RESCUE TEAMS AT READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Assistant Chief Orville Thiele, a husky, red-haired 25-year veteran of the 
Sioux City, Iowa, fire department, was at the console at 3:40 p.m. Wednesday 
when the Woodbury County communications center radioed that a crippled DC-10 
airliner was about to crash land. 
</P>
<P>
Thiele was stunned, but not unprepared. The area's surprisingly 
well-coordinated fire-and-rescue operations had confronted almost precisely 
such a problem in an exercise in 1987, and -- by lucky coincidence -- the 
emergency services had drilled again just two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all pretty well prepared," said Patti Bauerly, Thiele's administrative 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loses Hydraulic Pressure 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, they needed everything they could muster. Two minutes later, 
the communications center radioed again, this time to report that the airliner 
had lost hydraulic pressure, which meant that the pilot could not use the 
ailerons, landing flaps and brakes to control the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"All he could do was turn right," Bauerly said. "And hope." 
</P>
<P>
Robert White, a Sioux City police official, mused that ordinarily such crashes 
come without warning. The plane catches fire, or is thrown askew by a wind 
shear and bolts to the ground instantly. By the time the fire-and-rescue crews 
arrive, precious time has been lost. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, authorities had about 45 minutes' notice from the pilot before 
Flight 232 erupted in a ball of fire, flipped over on its back and crumbled 
into three huge chunks in a field a half-mile short of the huge 9,000-foot 
runway at Sioux Gateway airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We had time to coordinate, get a command center set up, start blocking off 
traffic," White said. White, Bauerly and almost everyone else who could get to 
a telephone began calling in off-duty fire and police personnel. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the DC-10 reached the Sioux City area, officials had assembled an 
array of some 35 fire engines, ambulances, rescue units and police cars, some 
of them from as far as 30 miles away. Some 200 police and rescue workers 
eventually gathered on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Richard Sorenson, a pilot with the Iowa Air National Guard, had just 
landed his own A-7 single-seat jet fighter and was taxiing toward the hangar 
when he got a warning from the airport control tower to clear the runway for 
the crippled Flight 232. 
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion was coming across that he was having severe controllability 
problems, that he could turn in only one direction and that he was not sure he 
could make the runway," Sorenson said at a late evening press conference. 
</P>
<P>
The airliner came in from the east and -- obviously with severe difficulty -- 
maneuvered into position to use the southwest runway, which usually remains 
unused. (Sioux Gateway was a base for B-29 Stratofortresses during World War 
II. It has the longest runway in the area.) 
</P>
<P>
In Sorenson's words: "Shortly before touchdown, about the time an airplane 
would begin to flare, the right wing began to dip and roll, and the nose began 
to fall, to a position of 15 to 25 degrees. It was very apparent at that moment 
he could not make a safe landing. 
</P>
<P>
"The only real question was how disastrous the impact would be. . . . There was 
a huge fireball, black smoke. . . . The plane began disintegrating, huge pieces 
began cartwheeling from the airplane. . . . There were a lot of things falling 
off the plane. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Rescue units sped quickly into the field to carry away survivors who were 
walking away from the burning wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department officials said it took 20 minutes to put out the blaze from the 
burning jet fuel and airliner. White said they were still searching for bodies 
Wednesday night when the sun went down and left only the glowing embers. 
</P>
<P>
"They're starting to walk the fields," White reported sadly. 
</P>
<P>
"We were as prepared as we could be," he said.

PANEL OKS WIDER CHILD-CARE TAX CREDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday approved a sweeping child-care 
plan that would provide roughly $5 billion a year in assistance, primarily by 
expanding a refundable tax credit for poor, working families. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved on a 26-10 vote, contains a number of similarities to 
President Bush's child-care proposal. Unlike the Administration plan, however, 
its benefits would not be limited to families with preschool-age children. It 
also would add about $400 million a year to help the states support child-care 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
It differs more sharply from a Senate bill supported largely by Democrats and 
approved last month. A separate House committee is also considering another, 
competing bill, but the House Democratic leadership appeared to be lining up 
behind the Ways and Means version. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had threatened to veto any measure that would subsidize child-care 
facilities, but Administration officials waffled on their position during the 
committee's closed debate on the bill, aides said. Although a Treasury official 
at the session opposed federal grants to child-care providers, he did not 
object to the overall measure. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the committee was nearing a vote on whether the capital gains tax 
rate should be lowered, with both the White House and the House Democratic 
leadership engaging in behind-the-scenes lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, according to lawmakers, began making personal appeals for 
support of a bill to reduce taxes on profits from investments, while House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) urged the committee to preserve the 1986 tax 
law revision, which ended the special rate for capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
Under the child-care measure approved by the Ways and Means Committee -- which 
is in the process of drafting a tax bill aimed at raising $5.3 billion for next 
year's budget -- poor, working parents could receive a tax credit based on the 
number of children in the family. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, poor families -- regardless of the number of children -- are 
eligible for a tax credit that is expected to reach a maximum of $1,002 in 
1991. The proposed new approach would increase the amount of the earned income 
tax credit to as much as $1,790 for a family with three or more children, with 
an additional credit of up to $430 available to families with at least one 
child younger than 6. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also would expand the system of making block grants to states to help 
pay for child-care services. It would add $400 million a year to the $2.7 
billion now being spent. 
</P>
<P>
The overall cost of the child-care package over a four-year period, from 1991 
to 1994, was put at $16 billion.

PUC ADOPTS UTILITY DISCOUNTS FOR NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday voted to create a 
program to provide low-income residential utility customers with discounted gas 
and electric rates, as ordered by a state law passed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's vote set eligibility requirements for customers to qualify for 
the discounts, which are expected to become effective Nov. 1, the beginning of 
the winter heating season. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will decide the actual amount of the discounts at a meeting in 
September, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the discounts, a customer's household income cannot exceed 
certain levels. For most utility customers, eligibility would be limited to 
households with an annual income of no more than $13,000 for one to two people, 
$15,200 for three people, $18,300 for four people and $3,000 more for each 
additional person. 
</P>
<P>
Utilities will begin notifying customers of the program in August and September 
bill inserts.

DON'T CONFUSE RELIGION, SCIENCE IN TEXTS, HONIG URGES PANEL

For schoolchildren to receive the best instruction in science, they must read 
textbooks that do not confuse religion and science, state Supt. of Public 
Instruction Bill Honig said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the California Curriculum Commission on a series of proposed 
guidelines for science textbooks, the schools chief urged commission members to 
strictly adhere to a new policy that directs that religious theories be 
excluded from scientific textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ethical and Moral' 
</P>
<P>
"These (religious theories) are things that are ethical and moral, and they 
should be addressed too by youngsters," he said. "But it's a different way of 
looking at things or understanding things, and the two really shouldn't be 
confused." 
</P>
<P>
Unless the nation's textbooks do a better job of teaching science, Honig said, 
the United States will not be able to maintain its "competitive edge" in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Honig made his comments as commission members began a public hearing on 
proposed guidelines for science textbooks. The commission is expected to adopt 
a set of science textbook guidelines Friday and then forward them as a 
recommendation to the 11-member State Board of Education. The final decision on 
the guidelines will be made by the board in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Christian fundamentalists are opposing guidelines proposed by the commission's 
science committee because they suggest that evolution should be treated in 
textbooks as "accepted fact." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Louis Sheldon, chairman of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values 
Coalition, told a press conference Wednesday that the proposal leaves no room 
for the presentation of competing theories on the origins of man, particularly 
the theory of creation or sudden appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it would only be fair to present a variety of viewpoints," he said. 
"We don't want any one theory taught." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate press conference, People for the American Way, a 
civil-libertarian group, said it would begin a grass-roots campaign to press 
the board to accept the guidelines as they have been proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hudson, western director and general counsel for the organization, said 
that unless textbook publishers are given specific direction, they tend to be 
"timid" and exclude any material on controversial subjects, such as evolution. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're really afraid of is another generation of scientifically illiterate 
children," he said. "I think study after study has shown that American 
schoolchildren rank far below other Western democracies and developed countries 
in terms of their scientific literacy."

TV PUTS ENGINEER'S LIFE IN FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day in 1969, Pasadena engineer Melvin Matthews bought his first color 
television set and eagerly plugged it in. 
</P>
<P>
He was terribly disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Matthews had accepted fuzzy pictures on his black-and-white set as 
part of life in the hilly Kinneloa Canyon area. But after investing several 
hundred dollars in a new color television, he wouldn't settle for anything less 
than crisp, vivid colors. 
</P>
<P>
"That prompted me to find a solution," said Matthews, then a test engineer for 
Rockwell International Corp. Because no cable company was willing to wire up 
Kinneloa Canyon just to attract 36 households, Matthews did it himself. 
</P>
<P>
From the handful of neighbors who first paid him $5 a month to share his 
antennas 20 years ago, Matthews has built a cable-television business that now 
serves 3,250 customers in three communities. 
</P>
<P>
He started out with Kinneloa Antenna Service, selling and repairing television 
sets and installing antennas for hotels and apartments. He now owns KTS Corp., 
which operates two cable systems. Kinneloa Television Systems serves the 
Kinneloa Ranch area and parts of Altadena, and Duarte Cable Communications 
holds the cable franchise in Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
Kinneloa and Duarte Cable are among the few owner-operated mom-and-pop cable 
systems in Southern California's highly competitive cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews and his wife, Donna Reed Matthews, plan to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very satisfied in keeping small," said Matthews, 44. 
</P>
<P>
Staying small allows the company to offer more personalized service. "We don't 
like to keep anybody on hold," Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
"Being small, there's not too many departments for a customer to go through." 
Together, the Pasadena and Duarte offices have nine employees, all of whom are 
trained to handle several jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Staying small also means that Matthews must wear half a dozen hats. He juggles 
duties as chief engineer, customer service representative, president, 
maintenance worker, bookkeeper and payroll clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the attraction, initially, to do a lot of things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its growth, the business has remained a family affair. Donna Matthews 
helps with the bookkeeping, and his 19-year-old stepson, David Reed, works 
part-time cleaning and repairing channel-selector boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Housed in a one-story building on E. Washington Boulevard, the company's 
Pasadena office is within a mile of the Matthews' home and has become a family 
gathering place. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, 4-year-old Kristiana Matthews bounded into her father's 
office to say hello. A few minutes later, her mother came in to use the 
computer to plan a family reunion. Darren Reed, 8, occasionally strolled in to 
hand writing assignments to his mother, who has chosen to teach him at home. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by his family, Matthews looked pleased and relaxed. Being his own 
boss allows him flexibility in his schedule, he said. But it also means 11-hour 
days, few lunch breaks, work on holidays and being on call 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ultimately responsible for keeping the system going," Matthews said. "Even 
though I'm president, I still go out to fix the cable when it breaks down." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews said he has no plans to switch careers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had various companies offering to buy the system, but we were 
concerned about who the buyer was," he said. "The only reason to sell out is if 
you don't want to wait 10 or more years to get profits out." But Matthews is in 
no particular hurry. 
</P>
<P>
"If we sold out, I'd have to go and look for another job," he said, explaining 
that selling his business would not bring financial independence. But it could 
mean he'd lose control over reception quality, which was what got him into the 
cable business in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"If we sell the system, then we'll be just a cable customer like everyone 
else," he said.

NANNY SCHOOLS 'PUT THE POLISH' ON CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the attentiveness of a mother, Jodi Roderick gently stroked the back of 
6-month-old Elizabeth Cross, who lay on a quilt amid the suburban elegance of 
The Claremont Club. 
</P>
<P>
Roderick's blue smock, displaying an embroidered antique pram, testified to her 
calling. She is a student at the American Nanny College, in Claremont and 
Montclair. As part of the college's learning laboratory, she and 10 other 
students care for the infants of parents who drop off their children before 
swimming, playing tennis or exercising at the club. 
</P>
<P>
By September, Roderick, a graduate of Redlands High School, will have completed 
her three-month course. And then, she said, she hopes to become a full-time, 
live-in nanny. 
</P>
<P>
"All the girls here love children. This is just an opportunity to learn to love 
them professionally," said Roderick, 19, as she baby-sat in the club's day-care 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Nanny schools across America are training women, and even a few men, to fill 
the growing child-care needs of not only the wealthy, but of working 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an anthropological experiment. We're bringing a British idea to America, 
and it's an idea whose time has come," said Beverly P. Benjamin, who founded 
the American Nanny College six years ago in Claremont, when only a handful of 
nanny schools existed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Now more than 50 educational institutions offer nanny training. 
</P>
<P>
A company that runs bartender schools last year -- in an oddly American twist 
-- bought a Beverly Hills nanny school, which has since relocated to Van Nuys. 
Furthermore, Benjamin said, the operator of a truck-driving school has 
expressed interest in getting into the booming business. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tremendous demand for in-home child care," said Sandra Lewis, 
director of the Nanny Institute of Beverly Hills. "But it just hasn't been a 
part of our American culture for people to go to school to learn how to care 
for children in the home." 
</P>
<P>
But acceptance of nanny training has grown, she said, and the American nanny 
movement has matured in the process. Now, Lewis said, classes at her school 
have expanded from 25 students a year to about 500 a year. Claremont's American 
Nanny College has trained over 200 nannies and two mannies, the male 
counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
In California, there are also nanny schools in Huntington Beach and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, a professor in child development at Chaffey College in Alta Loma, had 
founded her nanny college with two partners: Deborah Davis, a colleague at 
Chaffey, and British-trained nanny Diana Forne. Her two former partners have 
developed the International Nanny Assn., a nonprofit clearinghouse for nannies 
and nanny schools. Originally based in Pomona, it is now in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis is writing a textbook for nanny training. And, as a way to standardize 
training, the American Council of Nanny Schools wants to create a national 
nanny exam and the designation of CPN, or Certified Professional Nanny, 
Benjamin said. She said she is also considering ways to place temporary 
nannies, who can care for children when they are sick and cannot go to school. 
And she is investigating the possibility of training and employing homeless 
women as nannies. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin said she isn't bothered that these ideas seem remote from the British 
prim and proper nanny. "There is no stereotype of the American nanny," said 
Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
The British nanny, she said, had to learn "to iron diapers with an iron heated 
on a stove because she might be in Africa some day during a revolution . . . or 
in India. A nanny would go and be a little bit of England in the remote areas 
of the empire." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the basic idea is the same whether in America or Britain. "The British 
nanny was trained to raise the child whether the lord and lady were there or 
not," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Like their British counterparts, American nanny schools teach manners and 
social graces. "We put the polish on the person who has the background in child 
care," Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
But the schools also deal with such topics as how to help children deal with 
loss and grief, and "how to clean everything." Benjamin's students spend one 
day in seminars with Magda Gerber, a Los Angeles educator whose theories of 
letting children develop at their own pace have gained attention. 
</P>
<P>
The students also visit art museums and hear lectures on music as a way to 
elevate their awareness of the fine arts. "At one time we even had seven- and 
nine-course meals," Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
Students read books on childhood education and take courses in household 
management and self-esteem. Fashion consultants work with them on developing 
their image. All of this, Benjamin said, is designed to make the students more 
professional and more marketable. 
</P>
<P>
In America, it is not just the wealthy who take advantage of the newly trained 
crop of nannies. Benjamin estimates that 50% of the families that now hire 
nannies are two-career couples, with the rest evenly divided among the rich and 
single parents, who often must struggle to pay nanny costs. 
</P>
<P>
The nannies start off earning at least $200 a week, in addition to their room 
and board. 
</P>
<P>
For all the expense involved, Benjamin said, "parents really want somebody who 
rides on a magic umbrella . . . a Mary Poppins." 
</P>
<P>
But nanny students say this British image has little to do with attracting them 
to the profession; their principal interest is the satisfaction gained from 
one-on-one child care. "They aren't all looking for life among the country club 
set," Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, I never saw Mary Poppins," said student Helen Benton, 57. 
(The fictional character actually was not a nanny, but a governess, whose job 
included educating older children.) 
</P>
<P>
Working as a nanny, Benton said, is her way of countering what she sees as the 
impersonal values today in American society, which "seems more concerned with 
things instead of people." 
</P>
<P>
For Benton, who worked for two years at a day-care center, being a nanny will 
offer the opportunity to develop an intensely personal relationship with a 
child. She is excited by the prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"When children want love, they're not particular -- whether they get it from 
their mother, their father or a nanny," she said.

BLASZCAK SUIT ATTACKS RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former San Gabriel Vice Mayor Frank Blaszcak has sued to overturn the recall 
election that threw him out of office in May. 
</P>
<P>
Charging that there were widespread irregularities in the city-run election, 
Blaszcak, who was recalled by a nine-vote margin on May 23, is seeking to be 
reinstated on the City Council. A hearing has been scheduled for Aug. 10 in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Stephanie Scher said that Blaszcak's legal action was "without 
basis." The City Council has scheduled a special election for Sept. 12 to fill 
Blaszcak's seat. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rosen, Blaszcak's attorney, said that the election, which was supervised 
by Assistant City Clerk Cindy Bookter, had been "contaminated" and that the 
result was not accurate. He said enough voters either had been prevented from 
voting or allowed to vote improperly to raise questions about the final 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Bookter says that she strictly adhered to state elections laws.

ANTI-POLLUTION TALK SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Penny Newman, leader of a community group that has been working for cleanup of 
the Stringfellow Acid Pits in Riverside County, will speak Wednesday at a 
meeting of the San Gabriel Valley Superfund Working/Information Group (SWIG). 
</P>
<P>
SWIG was formed this year to monitor the cleanup of polluted ground water in 
the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the El Monte Community Center, 3130 
Tyler Ave. Newman is co-founder and executive director of a group that has 
worked on the Stringfellow cleanup project since 1979. She is also western 
field organizer of the Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste, a national 
environmental organization. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Johnson, one of the organizers of SWIG, said Newman was invited to offer 
advice on how the group can be most effective in seeking cleanup of polluted 
ground water. Both the Stringfellow Acid Pits and the San Gabriel Valley 
ground-water basin are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's list of 
toxic sites to be cleaned up with help from the federal Superfund.

ATLANTIC SQUARE'S PLAN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to complaints from neighbors upset by plans to refurbish the 
Atlantic Square Shopping Center, the Planning Commission has unanimously 
approved changes in the proposed traffic patterns, loading areas and entrances 
to the center. 
</P>
<P>
The board also gave its approval for the conditional-use permit and the 
tenant-mix plan that the developer, Champion Development Co. of Long Beach, 
needs to build the $26 million project at the corner of South Atlantic 
Boulevard and Floral Drive. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly six hours, beginning on the night of July 13, the board heard 
testimony from about 20 residents, city officials and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Among those testifying were some of the residents who late last month submitted 
petitions with more than 1,000 signatures protesting the redevelopment project. 
The petitioners claimed their needs had been ignored by city officials and the 
developer.

ANIMAL CRUELTY CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of two youths arrested in connection with a string of cat mutilations in 
March and April has pleaded guilty in Pomona Juvenile Court to three felony 
counts of cruelty to an animal. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Falls said the 16-year-old Covina youth, who 
was not identified because he is a juvenile, is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 
15. He faces a maximum punishment of four years and four months in detention at 
a California Youth Authority facility. 
</P>
<P>
The youth's 17-year-old co-defendant pleaded not guilty at the same hearing 
Tuesday and is scheduled to stand trial in Juvenile Court Aug. 11 on seven 
felony counts of cruelty to an animal, Falls said. 
</P>
<P>
The two youths were arrested April 25 in connection with the mutilation of at 
least seven cats in the Covina area. Some of the cats' bodies were dumped in a 
Covina schoolyard with satanic symbols scrawled in blood on a nearby wall. 
</P>
<P>
Falls said the mutilations were partly related to a dispute the youths had with 
their church group.

SWAP MEET PLAN DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owners of Edwards-Pacific Drive-In Theaters have withdrawn their 
application to expand a once-weekly Saturday swap meet to Saturdays and 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the swap meet has become unpopular with nearby residents, who 
complain about the traffic, lack of parking and the run-down appearance of the 
drive-in on Foothill Boulevard. Under pressure from the city, the Edwards 
family has made improvements to the facade of the 1960s theater. But traffic 
and parking problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the Planning Commission recommended that the city deny the proposal by 
the Edwards family, citing the adverse effect on the community. Edwards had 
been scheduled to appeal the matter before the City Council last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards' attorney Lawrence H. Davidson said the Edwardses "want to be a good 
neighbor and there was opposition by the community, and they want to evaluate 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The family has given no indication about their plans for the site, Davidson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is interested in exploring a redevelopment deal with Edwards to modify 
the 30-acre property's commercial-use zoning and will approach Edwards in the 
near future, City Administrator Julio J. Fuentes said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city is considering adopting an ordinance that would 
require swap-meet operators to obtain a conditional-use permit, which could 
impose new conditions on the operation of swap meets within the city.

seeking personal glory Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the all-star football game will be an arena where former Muir High 
School star Darick Holmes plans to give a lasting tribute to a loved one, 
2-year-old niece Destiny, who died from tumor complications this month. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes is one of 84 San Gabriel Valley graduated prep football stars slated to 
play in the 10th annual Hall of Fame All-Star football game. Kickoff is at 8 
p.m. Friday at Citrus College Stadium in Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
The game will showcase the talents of last year's pool of outstanding high 
school seniors, of which Holmes, a receiver on the West squad, is arguably the 
top performer. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched him quite a bit last year," says Hugh Von Plater, the all-star game 
organizer, "and I believe he was the best football player in Southern 
California. He ran in an offense that was basically 'Give it to Darick, and let 
him do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Muir's Mustangs depended almost exclusively on the 6-foot-1, 190-pounder. 
Playing option quarterback, Holmes skirted defenders to score 23 touchdowns, 
backed by 1,315 rushing yards. He completed nearly 50% of his passes for 
another 793 yards and seven scores. He was a first-team all-state selection. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 40 of the all-star game players have committed to head off for grid 
glory at the junior college level. Holmes is one of those ticketed for a JC 
program, although his talent and heavy recruitment certified him as a Division 
I player. His grades, however, didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Like many high school freshmen, Holmes paid more attention to activities 
outside the lecture hall. 
</P>
<P>
"My freshman and sophomore years I did real poor in school. If I hadn't 
transferred, I think I would have dropped out of school," said Holmes, who 
attended Pasadena High for a year and a half before switching to Muir. 
</P>
<P>
In order to make up for lost class credits, Holmes enlisted the aid of track 
Coach Clyde Turner to persuade the principal to allow him to take after-school 
courses. Each day, after football practice, Holmes attended two extra class 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
The experience motivated his classroom awareness, and Holmes walked across the 
stage on graduation night with a 2.7 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
But a lack of required preparatory courses made entrance into a four-year 
school nearly impossible. "He was working so hard just trying to graduate on 
time that it would have been impossible to take all the foreign language and 
science courses. He was essentially two years behind," said Turner. 
</P>
<P>
So, like countless other star athletes who stumbled academically, Holmes will 
spend at least two years at a JC. After listening through the plethora of 
coaches seeking his skills, he settled on Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
"He really is a bright kid," said Turner, who also coaches Holmes as a football 
assistant at Muir. "Sometimes kids get to high school and studying doesn't 
really hit them for the first couple of years. That's what happened to Darick." 
</P>
<P>
But on the field, the football scene was the only thing hit by Holmes. Before 
his academic deficiencies surfaced, Nebraska, USC and Brigham Young wanted the 
multifaceted player to come to their campuses and play what they saw as his 
most natural position -- wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
After an enviable ponder, Jim Hall, coach of the West All-Stars and Rosemead 
High, also decided that's where he wanted Holmes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hall: "He has those moves you can't teach. He has great speed and the 
elusiveness of a running back. If a coach had to, he could play him anywhere, 
and Darick would probably do it too, because I've seen nothing but a gentleman 
attitude from the young man." 
</P>
<P>
His natural speed is what prompted Turner to talk Holmes into going out for the 
track squad, even though he had never put on running spikes. This past spring, 
Holmes finished runner-up to the league champ in both the 100 and 200-meter 
sprints. He also ran the get-a-lead second leg of Muir's 4x100-meter relay crew 
that took fourth at the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind that if someone could train him he could be a 
world-class sprinter," Von Plater said. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes combines that speed with deft stop-and-go moves and a shaking, spinning 
running style that frustrates opponents trying to draw a bead on him. "He's 
real quick and agile. You either hit him on the side or not at all. He's also 
real slippery with lots of fakes. Tons of fakes," said linebacker Erich Trapp, 
a member of the West team and a defender when his Arcadia team beat Holmes and 
Muir in a 14-6 squeaker last year. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Spencer, another Arcadia player suiting up for the West cuts in and turns 
to Trapp to say proudly: "We held him to under 100 yards, didn't we? Yeah, I 
think we did." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Brownfield, a former Muir coach who caught the beginning of Holmes' 
high-wire football act before retiring, says the soft-spoken, somewhat shy 
young man is the best of Muir's storied line of football players: 
</P>
<P>
"Of the 57 kids who went on full rides (scholarships) from Muir while I was 
there, he's the best of the bunch. I'm not naming no names, but he's for sure 
the very best one they've had." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the names Brownfield won't mention include Muir alums Anthony Miller, a 
receiver at the University of Tennessee and currently with the NFL's San Diego 
Chargers, and Ricky Ervins, a current tailback at USC primed for a starting 
slot. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes eventually aims to play major college football, and he says biding his 
time at a junior college with a throwing quarterback ("I want to go to a team 
with a good quarterback, even if that's Baloney State") can only enhance his 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm ready to play for a big school, I would like to go to Miami, because 
I like the way their receivers play. They play real cocky, and that's the type 
of player I am on the field. Off the field, I'm friendly and good to get along 
with. On the field, I'm business. Even if they're (teammates) my friends, I'll 
let them know if they're making mistakes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, who is as soft spoken out of uniform as his uniform is flashy (the back 
of his Muir jersey reads "D-Loc" D. L. Holmes) won't be doing much talking 
Friday night on the Citrus field. He plans on letting his actions and a 
messaged towel do the communicating. 
</P>
<P>
His performance will tell football circles everywhere that his short dip into 
the obscurity of junior college football is not the last of him as a player -- 
and the towel hanging from his waist, with the words Destiny, Rest in Peace in 
large letters, will remind him of a game being played in dedication to a loved 
one.

AN ASSIGNMENT WITH A NEAR-FATAL TWIST

<P>
The instant I realized that I was still alive, I knew I had to move fast or I 
wouldn't be much longer. 
</P>
<P>
Bright sheets of yellow flame erupted from the wing nearest my seat in the 
single-engine plane, which had crashed during takeoff for Nome, ferrying boy 
aviator Tony Aliengena, myself and six others. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling the heat from the flames, I dived to get out. But I remained 
momentarily trapped by a seat belt that I had forgotten to unfasten. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting off panic long enough to unstrap the belt, I jumped head first into a 
tundra swamp, sinking hands and knees into the muck. As the other passengers 
scrambled to safety, I vaguely heard a bystander shouting: "Get out! Get out! 
It's gonna blow!" 
</P>
<P>
This was the scene Tuesday night for myself and the other passengers aboard the 
Cessna 210 Centurion that Tony, 11, had piloted round the world on an 
international friendship mission. Dubbed Friendship One, the red-white-and-blue 
Cessna had been a cheerful symbol of peace to millions who watched on TV as it 
landed in seven countries. 
</P>
<P>
None of us had felt comfortable about flying Tuesday out of this tiny Alaskan 
Indian village, where the Aliengena family and entourage had gone for a 
three-day fishing vacation. The weather had been stormy and cold, with fierce 
winds gusting off the nearby Bering Sea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Break in Rain Seen as Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
But we needed to get to Nome as soon as possible to resume Tony's flight, and a 
break in the rain late Tuesday provided Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, with an 
opportunity to ferry us out. Tony, who was not piloting the 90-mile leg, sat 
next in the co-pilot's seat. 
</P>
<P>
While boarding the high-wing plane, which shuddered in the icy wind, an 
accident happened that was something of a portent. Tony noticed that a radio 
headset was hanging outside the door, so he opened the door to pull it back in. 
But a gust of wind blew the door out of Tony's hand and off its hinges. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's father, exhausted from the tortuous, six-week trip, cursed bitterly, 
then set about reattaching the door without the hinges. He managed that by 
locking the door and taping it shut. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody, listen up," Aliengena called out afterward, as his seven 
passengers, including his wife, Susan, and 10-year-old daughter, Alaina, 
strapped themselves in for the 30-minute flight. "I want you to know the door 
is secure and that we could still fly even if it fell off. It would just be 
cold in here." 
</P>
<P>
With that, we settled back for takeoff. Although somewhat concerned about the 
weather, I was rather looking forward to the flight because Aliengena had 
promised to fly low enough that we could spot the reindeer, moose and bear that 
are abundant in the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting directly behind Tony, I could not see clearly ahead as Aliengena 
throttled Friendship One forward down Golovin's 2,800-foot gravel airstrip, 
which is atop a 50-foot embankment. Within seconds, however, I knew something 
was drastically wrong. 
</P>
<P>
I could see our plane veering sharply to the side of the embankment, driven 
over by 20-knot crosswinds. Then we were over the side and, for a moment, 
sailing through the air. 
</P>
<P>
The crash lasted just a few seconds, but they seemed like an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
I can remember thinking numbly that perhaps Aliengena could gain enough power 
to bring the plane back into the air. Then, in shock, I saw the green earth 
rushing at us as the Cessna struck the tundra at an angle, wheels-first. The 
impact tore off one of the wheels and blew Tony's taped door out. 
</P>
<P>
My seat rocked violently back and forth as the plane skidded through tundra. 
Then I saw a flash of bright yellow light as the right wing burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
During all of this, none of us uttered a word. But my thoughts were rushing 
furiously in a jumble. 
</P>
<P>
I remember thinking that this was it, and that my wife of one month, Adriana, 
would be a widow. 
</P>
<P>
After scrambling free of the plane, I turned back and saw that Tony and several 
others were still inside, struggling to clamber out. I yanked Tony from his 
seat and screamed, "Get out! Everybody get out!" 
</P>
<P>
Susan Aliengena, Tony's mother, was last to get out, crawling over seats from 
the rear of the six-seat cabin. 
</P>
<P>
Even outside the plane, we were not safe. With the wing's fuel tank ablaze, 
there was an imminent danger that the entire plane would explode like a 
gasoline bomb. Several local people shouted for us to run. 
</P>
<P>
The other passengers climbed the nearest embankment and took cover. Dazed and 
confused, I struggled to run through the knee-deep swamp in front of the plane 
for several yards before realizing I too had better get atop the embankment. 
</P>
<P>
The embankment climb was the hardest of my life. Soaking wet and having lost a 
shoe in the run from the plane, I struggled and struggled on the steep climb. 
My legs were so tired they wanted to give out. Glancing back at the blazing 
plane, I squeezed the last ounce of strength out of my body and reached the top 
of the embankment, where I rolled over and over until I was well past the range 
of any shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
On the gravel, panting, I heaved a huge sigh, then began checking myself for 
injury. My only injury would turn out to be a bruised rib. 
</P>
<P>
Although by some miracle the plane did not explode and none of us were 
seriously injured, we all walked around in shock, mouths agape. Seeing Susan 
Eisner, a 28-year-old film crew member who had accompanied Tony's flight, I 
exchanged looks of disbelief, then embraced her tightly. 
</P>
<P>
Someone then hollered at us to get down because we were standing in the path of 
any explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Alaina, sitting on the ground next to her mother, was sobbing uncontrollably. 
When she saw me, she wailed, "Poor Jim's never going to see his wife again." 
(Just last weekend, Alaina had admired some wedding pictures I had brought 
along on the trip.) 
</P>
<P>
Tony comforted his father, who gazed at the burning wreckage, cursing himself. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's blaming you, Gary," Eisner said with a hug. "You saved our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly detached from it all was Joseph Lee, a 29-year-old film maker from 
Los Angeles who suffered a deep gash to his bearded chin from a camera that he 
had cradled in his lap on takeoff. He and Eisner both hurried back to the plane 
as soon as the flames had been put out to recover their equipment, which was 
damaged a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, we were taken to a local clinic. There I telephoned my parents, my 
wife, then The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
<P>
Later that night, in an apartment in Nome, I found myself alone for the first 
time since the accident. Looking heavenward, I gave silent thanks. 
</P>
<P>
Then I wept like a child. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW THE CRASH HAPPENED 
</P>
<P>
The plane, piloted by Gary Aliengena, was about a quarter of the way down the 
2,800-foot runway when a very strong gust of wind forced the plane off the side 
of the 50-foot-high embankment. The plane was airborne for about 50 feet before 
it crashed into the marsh below. The plane bounced along the ground for about 
100 feet and tipped on it's right side, causing fuel in a wing tank to catch 
fire. 
</P>
<P>

AIRCRAFT CARRIED 2 MORE PASSENGERS THAN LIMIT

<P>
Federal authorities Wednesday started investigating the crash of a plane 
carrying 11-year-old Tony Aliengena and seven members of his round-the-world 
flight crew, saying it appeared that the plane was carrying two more passengers 
than is legal. 
</P>
<P>
A charter pilot familiar with the primitive airstrip in the tiny Indian village 
of Golovin, where the crash occurred Tuesday, said it appeared that the pilot 
also turned the plane the wrong way onto the runway and mistakenly tried to 
take off with, instead of against, a strong wind. The pilot was Gary Aliengena, 
Tony's father. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, accelerating to between 50 and 60 m.p.h., was blown off the runway 
by intense crosswinds and sent over a 50-foot embankment onto marshy tundra. 
One wing struck the ground, igniting the fuel inside the wing tank, but all 
eight people aboard escaped without serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena, a real estate investor from San Juan Capistrano, had flown the 
single-engine Cessna 210 Centurion to the coastal village 90 miles east of Nome 
for a brief fishing trip, a respite from the seven-week itinerary chosen to 
make Tony the youngest pilot to circumnavigate the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena said he is unaware of any mistakes made during the takeoff and is 
uncertain about what caused the crash. 
</P>
<P>
He said that it is a "question" whether too many people were aboard the plane 
and that he chose his takeoff direction because winds had shifted. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Steucke, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Anchorage, 
said Wednesday that crash investigators are en route to Golovin. 
</P>
<P>
He said that all the FAA's information on the crash so far has come from 
Aliengena and that the crashed plane carried eight passengers, including a 
reporter, but seats and seat belts for just six. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the FAA in Washington said regulations require a separate seat 
and seat belt for every passenger 2 years or older. 
</P>
<P>
Those who did not have their own seats and seat belts aboard the plane were 
Tony's sister, Alaina, 10, who sat on her mother's lap, and Tony's Soviet pen 
pal, Roman Tcheremenylch, 11, who sat between the pilot and co-pilot seats. 
</P>
<P>
A violation of the regulation can result in as little as a warning or as much 
as a $1,000 fine and suspension or revocation of a pilot's license, the FAA's 
Steucke said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Heinz of Golovin, a charter pilot who has flown in and out of the village 
for seven years, said persistent, strong crosswinds make the village's 
2,800-foot gravel runway one of the most treacherous on the Seward Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena reported a 20-knot wind during takeoff. Just before he began to taxi, 
the wind blew one of the airplane's doors off its hinges; Aliengena replaced 
it, sealing it with tape. 
</P>
<P>
Heinz said Aliengena appeared to take off in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine an experienced pilot doing that unless he is tired or in a 
hurry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other Alaskan commercial pilots said Aliengena reacted skillfully once the 
plane was blown from the runway. By applying full power and keeping the plane's 
nose up, Aliengena prevented the plane from nosing into the marsh and flipping 
over -- which could have brought about a fatal crash, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In Nome on Wednesday, Aliengena announced that another Cessna Centurion had 
been loaned, enabling Tony to finish the flight, dubbed Friendship Flight '89. 
</P>
<P>
The flight was scheduled to resume today at 7 a.m., Pacific time, ending at 
John Wayne Airport in Orange County sometime Saturday, one day behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Allyn of Hanford in Kings County, one of the chase-plane pilots following 
Tony since the flight began in Orange County on June 5, said Aliengena was 
short of sleep when he tried to take off from Golovin. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the party flew to the village of 120 people, which is accessible 
only by air or sea, for fishing and relaxation. But one of the Soviet 
journalists traveling with the party, Aleksie Grinevich, was injured in an 
off-road vehicle accident. At 2:30 a.m. Tuesday morning, Aliengena flew the 
injured man from Golovin to a hospital in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
Allyn and Gunter Hagen, a pilot who is monitoring the trip to verify it for an 
aviation record, were already in Anchorage for relaxation, Allyn said. 
Aliengena arrived and told them that he was going to sleep for two hours, then 
fly to Nome and dispatch a charter plane to pick up the party still waiting in 
the village. 
</P>
<P>
Allyn said he feared that Aliengena would be dangerously tired for such a trip, 
called Aliengena's wife, Susan, and received permission to send Hagen instead. 
But when Aliengena awoke later Tuesday morning, he was enraged to find that 
Hagen had left with the plane for Nome, Allyn said. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena flew to Nome on a commercial flight, took charge of the plane, flew 
to Golovin, loaded up the remainder of the party and prepared to fly the party 
back to Nome himself. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena made quick calculations on the weight of the plane's load and 
concluded that the eight passengers were within the plane's weight maximum. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was windy, with low clouds forming an 800-foot ceiling. Steucke, 
the FAA spokesman in Anchorage, said there was apparently nothing in the 
weather to preclude a safe takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
The gravel taxiway at the edge of the village heads toward the gravel runway. 
Fifty-foot embankments parallel the edges of the runway, below which lie marsh, 
then bodies of water on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
At about 8:45 p.m. Tuesday, Aliengena began accelerating for takeoff while 
still on the taxiway, then turned onto the runway. The plane had not yet risen 
from the runway when it was blown to the side. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena applied full throttle and tried to land the craft on the marshy 
tundra beside the runway, but a landing wheel dug into the soft ground, 
throwing the plane down against its right wing, which caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
All inside scrambled free. As the entire village population ran toward the 
wreckage, Aliengena kicked at the ground, cursing and blaming himself. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Lee, 29, a member of a documentary crew accompanying the party, suffered 
a gash in his jaw, which doctors said could require about 15 stitches. A 
reporter for The Times Orange County Edition suffered a bruised rib. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, who had been in the co-pilot's seat, received only a bump on the head. 
His sister, unhurt, told her mother: "Mommy, I don't want to go up in the air 
again." 
</P>
<P>
A charter flight returned the party to Nome about 1 a.m. Wednesday. Aliengena 
set about trying to find another aircraft to continue the trip; one was 
volunteered by Ralph C. Mellon Jr. of Soldotna, Alaska, a boat manufacturer. 
His plane, another Cessna 210 Centurion, was due in Nome Wednesday afternoon 
ready to resume the Friendship Flight this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance adjusters have arrived in Golovin to examine the damaged plane, which 
Aliengena owns. He said it is heavily damaged but may be repairable. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to Lance Allyn in Southern California, Aliengena said he expects to be 
criticized for the crash. "You know, it's like being a cop: You get the blame 
no matter what happens," he said.

It is an axiom of plane geometry that two parallel lines, however long they may 
run, never intersect -- never meet or touch or cross, in spite of the human 
eye's optical illusion that they do. 
</P>
<P>
Movies, film, television, all the incarnations of Hollywood, are supposed to 
work much the same way. The lines -- reality and fantasy -- are not intended to 
intersect. However realistic the fantasy tries to appear, the two are to be 
kept apart. 
</P>
<P>
This week, they have intersected. Reality has broadsided fantasy. In a city 
where scripts often read like police reports, police reports read like scripts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A young actress, with an ingenue freshness that got her hired for the 
kid-sister TV role that was her big break, is shot to death on her own 
doorstep, perhaps by a deranged fan. She had returned home from Italy, filming 
a miniseries about the brutal terrorist murder of a wheelchair-bound American 
man aboard a cruise ship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A man with a grudge and a gun smashed his way into Lorimar Studios, shot up 
a sound stage, then killed himself. He was a one-time business partner of a 
"Dallas" TV show actor, a failed venture in the staple food of movie palaces, 
popcorn. Lot workers said later that they thought it was a special-effects 
stunt. Before he shot up Lorimar, the man handed the guard an envelop that held 
a news article. Its headline: "Dreams, Feuds, Love, Lawsuits -- and Popcorn." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A young bit actor who once appeared in a TV show about two highway 
patrolmen who pursue and arrest evil-doers is killed on the spot when a 
brand-new stolen Chevrolet being chased by police slammed into his car on a 
street near Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And even as Shakespeare's grimmest dramas have moments of slapstick, a 
sidewalk preacher in fine moral dudgeon over actor Rob Lowe's blue-movie porn 
videotapes went to court to try to stop the actor from filming movie scenes in 
the mid-Wilshire apartment building where the preacher lives. The preacher 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
The ripples have scarcely ceased moving through the sets and studios and office 
suites of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody in L.A. right now feels terrible -- everyone's talking about 
it," said actress Theresa Saldana, who nearly died in a knife attack by a 
deranged fan bent on killing her as his "divine mission." She has fought to 
keep him in prison, and fought too for victims' rights. 
</P>
<P>
They talk about coincidence. They talk about the triad mythology, that 
disasters arrive in threes. They talk about the twin irritants of heat and 
humidity. Even the moon. "Well," postulated one Lorimar worker, "it was a full 
moon last night. That's one explanation for it." 
</P>
<P>
Out at Lorimar, Bob Peacock, who works in the film lab, didn't see the 
shooting, but around there, you never know "whether the sound of a gun is the 
real McCoy -- it is the movie industry. If you were looking down on the stages 
and saw some guy blowing up the wall with a gun, you wouldn't think anything 
about it. They knew this was no act only when the cops showed up." 
</P>
<P>
Said an executive on a daytime soap opera, whose actors find that fans often do 
not distinguish between the actors and the characters they play, insulting them 
or commiserating with them if they happen to encounter them in real life: 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we live in a land of illusion. They make movies so real now, and in 
movies, it's nothing to walk up and start shooting. So you have to consider. A 
lot of people say violence doesn't cross over into people's everyday lives, 
(but) things happen like this and you have to think twice about it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Always Tragic' 
</P>
<P>
"It's always tragic, but it's not surprising in today's world." 
</P>
<P>
A radio performer pointed to "the city of L.A. itself -- you've got not only 
people picking off high-profile people in general, but just driving down the 
freeway, gang wars, people at fast-food restaurants getting bumped off. There's 
a thin line anyway between fantasy and reality, and for people who live in a 
nether kind of world, maybe that (a movie, an actor or actress admired or 
reviled) spurred something." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Dr. Stuart Fischoff, who has produced and written TV movies -- 
most recently "Miles to Go" with Jill Clayburgh -- sees Tuesday's swath of 
violence as another piece of the pattern without a pattern: a society where 
frustration creates violence and where that violence intrudes on every level of 
life and life style, seeping even into the charmed circle of Hollywood as 
surely as it does in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, "it's been pretty well documented by research that TV tends to 
blur the real world; reality becomes less real. The intersection of these two 
experiences is going to occur a lot more often" -- not necessarily with violent 
consequences, but as a matter of perception. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially," Fischoff added, "with people relying more and more on electronic 
relations -- me and the TV, me and the fax machine, me and the computer," the 
cocooning-retreat from complex social challenges to less demanding electronic 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
The fictions of television and movies provide a new kind of community, their 
inhabitants are our neighbors, and thus their impact is almost personal, even 
when the tragedies occur to people we do not meet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unclear Lines 
</P>
<P>
Fantasy tragedies can make us cry -- Dr. Jerry Clark, president of the media 
division of the American Psychological Assn., recently sniffled his way through 
the movie "Field of Dreams." That is the art of it. But when for certain 
imbalanced fans the line between the actor and the person is not clear, danger 
emerges. 
</P>
<P>
The man who killed Schaeffer "probably had fantasized an intimate relationship 
with her," Fischoff said. "What happens with TV is even the people who are too 
psychologically weak to go outside and relate to people . . . can relate to 
people in television, and then if it goes far enough you get the Hinckleys and 
(Jacksons, Saldana's attacker) who probably feel very righteous in what they 
did." 
</P>
<P>
The intrusion of real life on Hollywood is of course not new, but it does seem 
to many to be escalating. There have been movie-set accidents, where fantasy 
disintegrates into tragic reality, from the earliest movies when the actress 
crossing the ice floes in "Uncle Tom's Cabin" slipped into the freezing water, 
to the deaths and injuries of stunt men and the death of three performers, Vic 
Morrow and two children, in the "Twilight Zone" movie, which precipitated an 
industrywide safety scare. 
</P>
<P>
But the personalizing of violence to the performer is something else. 
</P>
<P>
Just the recent instances: the man who showed up at Universal Studios to kill 
actor Michael Landon, and allegedly killed two security guards; a man being 
held in Illinois, who allegedly threatened singer Olivia Newton-John and 
several others; a woman who just pleaded not guilty to sending more than 5,000 
threatening letters to actor Michael J. Fox, and a woman who broke into 
late-night host David Letterman's house and believes herself to be his wife. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security Problems 
</P>
<P>
Security consultant Gavin de Becker, who has advised Saldana, Fox and others, 
and talked to legislators about special security problems for celebrities, sees 
"a blurring of the line" of behavior toward actors "that we come to feel 
intimately involved with, characters we really don't know but think we do." 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the American dream, this is the flip side. . . . When they 
tell you you'll be free and you'll be famous and well to do, well compensated, 
they don't also tell you you'll be at the center of a hurricane of desperate 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Clark, the psychologist, says it is "coincidental" that three deaths 
should occur in one day, "but it's not coincidental that there's more violence 
than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
It points to the need to "reduce the amount of violence" on TV and in films. 
</P>
<P>
"Who needs Lethal Weapon 2? I really do like the two actors but. . . . " 
</P>

LESS SMOKING, LESS DRINKING;

<P>
O.C. HEALTHIER THAN REST OF U.S.

<P>
Orange County residents drink less, smoke less and are healthier than Americans 
around the country, according to a comprehensive health survey released by UC 
Irvine researchers on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Of residents polled, 58.6% said they were free of nine major diseases, 
including diabetes, heart disease and cancer, compared to 56% nationwide, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
But ironically, when Orange County residents do describe a health problem, they 
are more likely than residents elsewhere to report several major medical 
conditions rather than one. 
</P>
<P>
These findings indicate that "perhaps the health care system (in Orange County) 
is superior, so we diagnose more diseases," frequently discovering an illness 
earlier -- "before people die from it," said Dr. Hoda Anton-Culver, a UCI 
professor of community and environmental medicine who was part of the 
four-member survey team. 
</P>
<P>
Their poll, the 1989 Orange County Health Surveys, was the first in a five-year 
series of surveys assessing the health of Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
Funded by $160,000-a-year grants from the Irvine Health Foundation, the surveys 
not only look at the incidence of disease here but also consider risk factors 
for illness such as smoking, drinking and obesity. The results released 
Wednesday were taken from random telephone interviews with 800 residents last 
October and another 800 residents this June. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers said they hoped that Orange County hospitals and health 
agencies could use the information -- "snapshots" of the county's health -- to 
shape strategies for preventing illness. 
</P>
<P>
Wiath a poll that focuses on Orange County, "you see problems you would not 
have expected in the federal data," said Ray Catalano, a former UCI professor 
of social ecology who plans to continue work on the health surveys even though 
he recently accepted an appointment at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
The surveys revealed some problem areas, researchers said, including 
indications that young women in Orange County are more likely to be depressed 
than men or women in other age categories. Some 14.6% of women ages 18 to 34 
reported they were depressed contrasted with only 6.2% of men in the same age 
group, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Social ecology professor David Dooley said the reason for their depression was 
unclear, but he theorized that "maybe it's more difficult for these young women 
to combine the role of worker and young mother -- and achieve a family 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the overall findings on depression showed that fewer Orange County 
residents were depressed than residents elsewhere -- only 7.2% here compared to 
13% in Los Angeles County and the nation. Dooley attributed the difference to a 
"higher level of affluence" in Orange County. Also, he said, statistics on 
depression in the Los Angeles area were gathered from 1978 to 1982 during a 
period of economic recession, when unemployment rates were high. 
</P>
<P>
Other findings from the survey: 
</P>
<P>
*Concern about AIDS is rising. When the interviews began last October, 10% of 
those surveyed said they knew someone with AIDS, but by the second set of 
interviews ending in June, 15% reported they knew someone with AIDS, Catalano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
*About 10% of residents who needed to see a doctor said they did not do so 
because "it cost too much," Catalano said. He said later surveys will include 
questions on obtaining medical care, including whether complicated insurance 
policies discourage patients from using them. 
</P>
<P>
*Only 17.3% of Orange County residents are overweight, compared to 21% 
nationally. Of those, 21.2% of Orange County men were overweight compared to 
21.8% nationally, but only 13.8% of women are overweight compared to 21.1% 
nationally. Asked why so many Orange County women were slim, Catalano admitted: 
"I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
*According to the survey, 24.5% of men and 20% of women in Orange County smoke 
compared to 32.6% of men and 27.9% of women nationally. Also, fewer Orange 
County residents drink alcohol than nationwide, with 63.6% of men and 46% of 
women here reporting they drink compared to 76.1% of men and 55.5% of women 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Anton-Culver said she believed that the rate of alcohol consumption here was 
still uncomfortably high, but the low smoking rate showed that "people in 
Orange County are more concerned about their health." 
</P>
<P>
*When residents reported their medical conditions, the greatest percentage, 
19.2%, reported they were suffering from arthritis. That was followed by kidney 
and bladder disease (12.4%), heart disease (9.9%), asthma (7.3%), emphysema and 
bronchitis (5.9%), cancer (5%), diabetes (3.3%), liver disease (2.3%) and 
stroke (1.4%). 
</P>
<P>
The incidence of arthritis here is higher than the national rate of 13.8%. "It 
could be that people (with arthritis) migrate into Orange County," Anton-Culver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
*In a look at medical problems and smoking, UCI researchers found that many of 
those with significant medical conditions had given up the habit. "If a disease 
is probably fatal, they stop smoking," Anton-Culver said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, a relatively high number of those with arthritis -- 
26.9% of women and 11.5% of men -- were continuing to smoke. She called that 
finding surprising and worth additional study.

COUPLE ARGUED ABOUT SELLING IT; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSE CALLED FACTOR IN THE MOORE TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a few months after the 1985 baseball season when California Angels star 
pitcher Donnie Ray Moore, as rich and successful as he had ever been, moved out 
of his condominium and onto a 1.5-acre estate in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's three young children were enchanted by the place, and couldn't wait to 
start boating around its private lake and bouncing on a trampoline built into 
the back yard of the four-bedroom house, recalled Robert Andri, who said he 
sold Moore the property for $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It was paradise," Andri said. "They were very excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
But the house that heralded Moore's arrival as a big-time pitcher was also a 
factor in his demise. At a press conference Wednesday, family spokesman Randall 
Johnson said that a dispute about selling the home ended Tuesday with Moore 
shooting his wife in front of the children and then killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
Tonya Moore, 35, was in serious but stable condition at Kaiser Permanente 
Medical Center in Anaheim, recovering from two bullet wounds in the neck and 
chest, Johnson said, adding that she was alert and talking to family members on 
Wednesday from her bed in the intensive-care unit. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Powell, a psychologist and friend of the family, said that the couple's 
17-year-old daughter, Demetria, seemed to be coping with the tragedy, but her 
younger brothers are having a difficult time understanding what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"They still (are) asking about Dad," Powell said of 7-year-old Ronnie and 
10-year-old Donnie Jr. "Just imagine your worst nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
About 30 friends and family members gathered at the hospital Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Demetria, Ronnie and Donnie Jr. went back and forth from the lobby to the 
intensive-care unit waiting area. Ronnie went to the hospital gift shop and 
bought a necklace for his mother. At times, both boys were running around, 
playing with friends and family members. Once, Ronnie stopped by a newspaper 
rack and pointed to his father's photograph on the front page. 
</P>
<P>
"See -- he's on the cover of the newspaper," Ronnie said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, it appeared that Moore had nothing but a bright future ahead of him. 
After 13 years as a professional baseball player, he signed with the Angels and 
proceeded to set a team record by racking up 31 saves as a relief pitcher. The 
Angels rewarded his success with a three-year, $3-million contract after the 
season, making him the highest-paid pitcher on the team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
That Home Run 
</P>
<P>
After that, Moore bought his Anaheim Hills house and started another successful 
season in 1986, saving 21 games and helping the Angels reach the playoffs. But 
in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series, with two out in the ninth 
inning and two strikes on batter Dave Henderson, Moore gave up a home run that 
allowed the Boston Red Sox to beat the Angels and subsequently advance to the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Moore became despondent about giving up the home run, and at one point, Dave 
Pinter, his agent for 12 years, advised him to seek professional help. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Angels second baseman Bobby Grich, attending a dinner Wednesday night 
where he was inducted into the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame, recalled how 
Moore had been booed by fans the year after he gave up the home run. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing for Donnie Moore would have been to be traded after the '86 
season," said Grich, who played alongside Moore that year. "He wouldn't have 
had to hear the boos that way. I feel sorry for Donnie because he wasn't able 
to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just a Baseball Game' 
</P>
<P>
Grich disagreed with those who blame the news media for periodically writing 
about Moore's ill-fated pitch: "The media as well as the fans won't forget that 
home run, but this is just a baseball game. You have to get over something like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Wednesday that "Donnie felt bad about what happened" during the 
playoff game. "But he didn't feel it was entirely his mistake. He was told to 
make that pitch. He felt it was a good pitch." 
</P>
<P>
In any event, after that game, Moore's baseball career deteriorated. Unable to 
recover from persistent injuries, he was released by the Angels in September of 
last year, and trouble was not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
Although Moore was signed by the Omaha Royals, Kansas City's AAA team, Andri 
said, Moore began to be late making a $2,000-a-month second mortgage payment to 
him. (Andri said Moore paid $4,000 a month to a savings and loan that held a 
first mortgage on the house.) 
</P>
<P>
"The first couple of years when he received a million dollars a year, it 
(Moore's payment pattern) was like clockwork," Andri said. "The last year, it 
hasn't been so good." 
</P>
<P>
However, Johnson denied Wednesday that the Moores were behind in making 
mortgage payments. "They traveled extensively," Johnson said. "Like anyone, 
they might have been one or two days late (in making the payments) when they 
came home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Couple Quarreled 
</P>
<P>
Moore's flagging career also apparently took its toll on his marriage. 
Neighbors said they could hear the couple quarrel frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Then last month, the Royals minor league team released him. About the same 
time, Moore's wife filed a change-of-address form with the state Department of 
Motor Vehicles, indicating that she had moved to Ontario. Johnson denied 
Wednesday that the couple had separated. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Moore called Anaheim real estate agent Jimmy Weatherspoon through a 
newspaper advertisement and told him he wanted to unload the house, according 
to a secretary in Weatherspoon's office. "He was real anxious to sell," the 
secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the whole family sat down Tuesday afternoon to discuss selling the 
house and moving back to Moore's home state of Texas when an argument erupted 
between Moore and his wife. Moore went for a .45-caliber pistol that he kept in 
the house, and fired four or five rounds, police investigators said. Two 
bullets struck Moore's wife, and their daughter helped her into a car and drove 
to the hospital, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore then shot himself once in the head in front of the two boys, according to 
Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth. Either Ronnie or Donnie Jr. summoned police 
at 4:41 p.m. Autopsy results released Wednesday showed that Moore had died from 
a single gunshot wound to the head, Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with KABC-TV Wednesday night, Demetria Moore said 
that only one of her brothers had actually seen their father shoot himself. 
</P>
<P>
"When he got cut from Kansas he'd been really depressed about that," she said 
in the interview. "And I mean, here he is, the high-life career was off and 
then all of a sudden -- boom -- it's gone. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And then he comes back to home . . . and the marriage, the family, is all 
destroyed. And I mean, what else does he have left? 
</P>
<P>
"No one has a perfect marriage," the teen-ager said. "I mean, of course they 
quarreled throughout the whole time they've been married, but it just didn't 
seem that anything would lead up to this. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, my dad has always been the type of guy that would keep his problems 
unto himself. He wouldn't like to talk to other people about it." 
</P>
<P>
The parents of both Tonya and Donnie Moore were expected to arrive Wednesday in 
Orange County. Funeral arrangements are pending, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopeful 2 Weeks Ago 
</P>
<P>
When Johnson last spoke to Moore, about two weeks ago, the player expressed 
hope about being signed by the Houston Astros organization. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea he was having such serious problems," Johnson said. "He talked 
about going fishing. He wanted to get his mind off playing baseball." 
</P>
<P>
At today's game in Detroit against the Tigers, the Angels plan to observe a 
moment of silence in memory of Moore.

PANEL DELAYS BILL SEEKING VOTE ON TAX HIKE TO BUILD JAIL

In what supporters said was a major setback, an Assembly committee put on hold 
Wednesday a bill that would ask Orange County residents to consider a half-cent 
sales tax increase next year to pay for a new central jail. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, reluctant members of the Assembly Local Government Committee decided 
to lump the county measure, sponsored by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach), with three similar bills and take them up as a package after 
legislators return from their summer break in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose), chairman of the committee, said he 
wanted the delay to examine the jail tax bills to make sure they would pass 
constitutional muster if approved by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
But Bergeson said the delay jeopardizes chances that the county tax question 
can be put before the voters on the June, 1990 ballot, as local political 
leaders had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Before the measure can be approved for the ballot, it must jump through several 
legislative hoops between the time lawmakers return from the break Aug. 21 and 
they adjourn for the year Sept. 15. And that is a daunting task during the 
hectic weeks known as the "end of session rush," Bergeson said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it had been approved today, we would have been virtually assured passage of 
the bill" on the floor, she said, adding that now the odds are more like only 
30%. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson's measure is considered by county officials as the only politically 
viable option to help solve the jail crowding crisis, which Sheriff Brad Gates 
has estimated will force him to give an early release to nearly 50,000 
prisoners this year. 
</P>
<P>
Gates and the county are under a federal court order to find new jail space. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would ask county voters on the 1990 ballot whether money for new jails 
should come from a half-cent sales tax, which is estimated to generate $121 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the amount is not nearly enough for the $434 million in expansion and 
new facilities that are needed, county officials said it is crucial seed money 
to begin such upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
Several times during Wednesday's hearing, Bergeson and her county colleagues on 
the committee stressed that a delay in approving the sales tax proposal would 
mean that many more "rapists and murderers" would be prematurely released to 
county streets. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), a member of the committee, 
expressed frustration at what he said were delaying tactics by others on 
Cortese's panel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Sense of Urgency' 
</P>
<P>
"Are we going to have a sense of urgency here?" Ferguson asked. "You tell the 
senator to wait a little while. What do you mean by wait a little while? 
</P>
<P>
"We have prisoners sleeping in hallways and shower rooms. You're letting people 
go out on the street who shouldn't be out on the street. They belong in 
prison." 
</P>
<P>
Cortese bristled at the criticism. "You don't have the corner on sensitivity or 
concern," he told Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
Cortese and others on the panel said they wanted another month to study the 
jail tax proposals to make sure that they could survive a court challenge in 
relation to a recent decision that has thrown a shadow over such sales tax 
schemes, all of which require only a simple majority to pass. 
</P>
<P>
In March, a Superior Court judge overturned the 1988 election approving a 
half-cent sales tax for jails in San Diego County. San Diego voters had 
approved the tax by a thin majority: 50.6%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
S.D. Election Thrown Out 
</P>
<P>
The judge threw out the election, challenged by the Libertarian Party, ruling 
that it had been designed to "purposely circumvent" a provision of Proposition 
13 that requires a two-thirds approval by voters for special taxes -- a margin 
that politicians concede is generally impossible to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
Although San Diego's tax failed on the first round of judicial review, several 
other counties have advanced similar proposals. Besides Orange County, 
Riverside, Los Angeles and Humboldt counties are asking the Legislature this 
year to authorize a half-cent sales tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials, working with Bergeson, said they have fashioned their 
bill to avoid at least some the legal pitfalls that resulted in the San Diego 
decision. They are confident that such provisions as an independent county 
jails commission -- the agency that would dispense the sales tax revenues -- 
would pass constitutional muster if challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried to Force a Vote 
</P>
<P>
On a motion by Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), county committee 
members tried to force a vote on their jail tax bill and get it out of 
Cortese's panel. But Cortese and several other key assemblymen on the 11-member 
committee abstained, thereby guaranteeing that the measure would fail to get 
the six votes needed to advance to the Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
Cortese said he will take up all of the jail tax bills at the panel's Aug. 23 
meeting, where lawmakers may combine them into one bill. He said such a move 
could strengthen their chances of surviving almost certain court challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has ever pointed out to me the failure of taking our time to do 
something right, rather than speed it up and doing it wrong and encourage the 
hodgepodge approach of what is going on here," Cortese said.

CAMPBELL CONFERENCE PAYMENTS DISCLOSED 
</P>

<P>
A 1988 women's conference sponsored by state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda 
Heights) paid $200,000 to a consulting firm owned by Campbell's wife and one of 
his former aides, state records filed on Wednesday show. 
</P>
<P>
The amount paid to the firm, West Coast Seminars of Laguna Niguel, accounted 
for more than 40% of the $486,000 in expenses incurred by the three-day 
conference held at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers on April 2 and 4 last year, 
according to records filed with the state's Registry of Charitable Trusts. 
</P>
<P>
The filings are the latest disclosure about Campbell's controversial, nonprofit 
conferences, which have drawn the ire of feminists and attracted the interest 
of state investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office is investigating the propriety of fees paid 
to the consulting firm, which Orange County records show was formed by 
Campbell's wife, Margene, and Karen L. Smith, then an aide to the senator, in 
early 1987. 
</P>
<P>
And the state's Fair Political Practices Commission has also opened its own 
review to see if the payments to the consulting firm -- as well as to one of 
Campbell's secretaries and his chief aide, Jerry Haleva -- were all properly 
recorded on annual economic interest statements. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the federal Small Business Administration has asked Campbell to 
repay $49,300 that it spent on the 1988 gathering. The agency wants the money 
back because it contends that Campbell violated an oral agreement on the fee 
that he was to pay Smith as coordinator of the event, according to a recently 
released report by the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
Although the repayment request was made in January, Campbell had not refunded 
the money by May 9, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Graham, a Democrat who ran against Campbell unsuccessfully in 1988, said 
Wednesday's filings indicate once again that the Hacienda Heights Republican 
used the conferences to "line his own pockets. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"What appalls me is that this man who is supposed to be representing the people 
and women can take this money and walk away with it," Graham charged. "It blows 
my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell failed to return telephone calls on Wednesday and his wife couldn't be 
reached for comment. An employee at Campbell's El Toro district office said 
Wednesday that Smith quit the senator's staff in May. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper articles last year prompted the investigations by revealing the 
payments to Campbell's wife and staff members from previous women's conferences 
-- annual affairs that began in 1984 to offer tips on careers, personal 
development and "life enrichment." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, such female luminaries as Jihan Sadat, the former first lady of 
Egypt, and talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey have addressed the gatherings. Last 
year, U.S. Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin gave a luncheon address about the 
child-care problems of working women. 
</P>
<P>
A program for the 1988 conference also lists Campbell's wife as a "community 
leader" who took charge of a seminar entitled "Secrets of a Successful 
Marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state records have shown that the conferences were lucrative for 
Margene Campbell and others close to Campbell. One of the prime financial 
beneficiaries has been Smith, formerly the senator's Orange County field 
coordinator, who earned a total of $61,500 for individual work on the 
conferences between 1984 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, county records show, Smith formed a consulting firm with Campbell's 
wife four days before the 1987 conference. The firm was paid a fee of $165,000 
to arrange the conference -- an amount that totaled nearly 30% of the expenses 
for the event, state records show. 
</P>
<P>
Filings on Wednesday show that the consulting firm did even better the next 
year, taking in $200,000 for the April, 1988 event. If Margene Campbell is 
half-owner of the consulting firm, that would mean that the senator's 
community-property share of the payments would be $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's filings also show that the 1988 event paid out $40,947 in salaries, 
but the documents do not identify who received the money. The paper work shows 
that while the 1988 conference received $455,684 in revenue -- most of it 
coming from corporate sponsors and attendance fees -- it still ended with a 
$27,315 deficit, which was made up by more than $50,000 in surplus carried over 
from previous conferences. 
</P>
<P>
The other major expense listed by the filings is $142,798 paid to the Anaheim 
Hilton to rent conference rooms in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
A Hilton employee said that the bill was sent to Campbell's El Toro office on 
Lake Center Drive, the same address that is given for the nonprofit group on 
Wednesday's filing. 
</P>
<P>
The employee also said that Smith is arranging another women's conference for 
the Anaheim Marriott this year, but the event will not be connected with 
Campbell, who has reportedly dropped his sponsorship in the wake of the 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the nonprofit women's conference had sought to delay the filing 
of the organization's 1988 report until Oct. 15, but the state attorney 
general's office turned down that request on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter denying the request, Deputy Atty. Gen. Yeoryios C. Apallas cited 
the department's audit of the organization and said the 1988 figures were 
needed "to enable us to make a determination as to the reasonableness and 
appropriateness of certain consultant fees paid to disqualified persons."

SANITATION DISTRICTS WON'T ALTER OCEAN DUMPING PRACTICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sanitation Districts of Orange County voted Wednesday night to continue 
dumping about 260 million gallons of partially treated sewage into waters off 
Huntington Beach annually rather than spend $1.4 billion on added treatment 
facilities to cut the amount of solid waste pumped offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Despite testimony of representatives from environmental groups that such 
continued dumping threatens the public health, the 37-member board voted 
overwhelmingly to apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for a 
second five-year waiver from water quality standards in the federal Clean Water 
Act. Six members of the board voted not to seek a waiver and to add to 
treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The districts' board of directors, which represents 80% of northern Orange 
County, decided that the impact of ocean dumping of sewage treated to less than 
full secondary standards as required has been minimal and that the alternative 
would be too costly, amounting to increased sewer fees of $25 per household 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
Board Vice Chairman A.B. (Buck) Catlin, before casting his vote at the hearing 
in the Fountain Valley Community Center, said there is no evidence that the 
marine environment offshore has been harmed by current dumping practices. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the sanitation districts pursue stringent restrictions, we will not 
damage the environment to any deeper extent," Catlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Catlin said full secondary treatment of sewage requires more landfill space for 
an increased amount of sludge. 
</P>
<P>
Those who favor improved sewage treatment facilities, such as environmental 
groups concerned about marine life, say the increasing amount of sewage -- an 
estimated 400 million gallons a day by the year 2020 -- would put a strain on 
the environment. They contend that improved treatment would ensure that the 
impact on marine life and beaches never gets worse than it is today. 
</P>
<P>
If current dumping practices continue, "cockroaches will be the best animal to 
survive in the new environment," said Margaret Johnson of Huntington Beach and 
a member of the American Cetacean Society, which seeks to protect marine 
mammals. "The ocean out there is not one big tidy bowl. We want the ocean 
clean." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the sanitation districts' board who expressed the most support for 
adding additional facilities represented Orange County's beach communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot take a chance on the environment," said board member and Huntington 
Beach City Councilman Tom Mays. "The ocean began life, and it can also end it." 
</P>
<P>
The debate over sewage treatment has gone on since 1972, when Congress passed 
the Clean Water Act, setting a standard that all of the country's waterways 
should be fishable and swimmable. 
</P>
<P>
The law required treatment plants to process sewage twice to remove at least 
85% of the solids before dumping the effluent into water. The act was amended 
in 1977 after coastal cities complained that they were being held to standards 
intended for lakes and rivers even though oceans have a greater capacity to 
absorb sewage. 
</P>
<P>
The amended bill allowed the EPA to grant waivers to coastal areas that could 
prove that they were meeting clean water standards without full secondary 
treatment of their sewage. The county sanitation districts received a five-year 
waiver in 1985. It expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiver Plans Dropped 
</P>
<P>
Two southern Orange County sanitation districts several years ago dropped plans 
to seek waivers in the face of opposition from local environmentalists. Now, 
the cities of Los Angeles and San Diego have opted to spend billions to upgrade 
sewage treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Orange County sanitation agency, which has facilities in 
Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach, provides primary treatment -- sewage 
processed once -- to all its sewage, and secondary treatment to half. Under 
primary treatment, 75% of the solids are taken out, sanitation district 
officials said. Under secondary treatment, 85% of the solids would be removed. 
</P>
<P>
According to a sanitation agency report on the issue, 18 acres of the ocean 
bottom would be affected by the county's sewage outfall without secondary 
treatment. With full secondary treatment, only five acres would be less pure 
than surrounding waters. 
</P>
<P>
The county's sewage goes through a massive pipe that lies beneath Brookhurst 
Street in Huntington Beach, continuing underneath Pacific Coast Highway and out 
along the ocean bottom for about five miles. 
</P>
<P>
There, 200 feet below the surface, it dumps almost all of Orange County's 
partially treated sewage. The sewage outfall has been operating for almost 18 
years. No evidence of damaged marine life has been reported. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the decision, most county residents will pay more in future sewage 
fees, as county facilities will have to be expanded to accommodate the 
increased flow of sewage expected by 2020.

RETIRED OFFICER CHASES DOWN ROBBERY SUSPECT 
</P>

<P>
A retired police officer surprised, chased and overpowered an armed man who 
tried to hold up a packed Huntington Beach restaurant Wednesday while the 
former officer was dining there with his wife, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Dan Johnson said Richard Roberts, 60, of 
Westminster, and his wife, Pat, were having an early dinner at about 4:45 p.m. 
at the Hungry Bear restaurant when Roberts noticed a man walk in with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned to my wife and said as quietly as possible, 'Don't move! The place is 
being held up,' " said Roberts, who has been retired from the Long Beach Police 
Department for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said he strolled outside as casually as possible, then told bystanders 
to call police while he staked out the restaurant at 1600 Bolsa Chica St. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told them, 'The Hungry Bear is being robbed. The Hungry Bear is being 
robbed,' " Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
While Roberts was getting help, Johnson said, the robber was telling restaurant 
patrons to keep their distance as he tried to open the cash register. He 
hammered on the register without success and, after a few minutes of fumbling 
with the buttons, ran outside, where Roberts was waiting for police to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the gunman fled on a bicycle and Roberts gave chase in his car. 
</P>
<P>
During the chase, Johnson said, the robber turned and pointed the gun at the 
pursuing car. But Roberts quickly rammed the bike, knocking the man off. 
Johnson said Roberts ran from his car and grabbed the suspect's gun just as he 
was reaching for it. The two struggled and shots were fired, but no one was 
hurt, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, police arrived and Richard C. Dodge, 27, of Huntington Beach was 
arrested on suspicion of armed robbery. Police said he also is suspected of 
robbing a market across the street from the Hungry Bear minutes before the 
attempted restaurant holdup. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who had been an officer for 31 years and 6 months, said of his 
encounter: "I was terribly shaken. I'm still shaken. It has been a long time."

SEPARATE SESSIONS FOR BOYS, GIRLS; 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE TO SEGREGATE SEX EDUCATION CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Boys and girls will be segregated during sex education in junior high school 
next year under a trial plan approved by Irvine school officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Unified School District Board of Education, responding to a survey 
of parents, voted 5-0 late Tuesday to separate seventh- and eight-grade boys 
and girls for one week of a 12-week health education course. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 people attended the school board meeting Tuesday night, including four 
parents who told trustees they should honor the wishes of the majority of those 
surveyed who want their children separated by sex. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents had argued, and the board agreed, that students might feel more 
comfortable discussing some sexual topics separately. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to protect our children," said parent Barry Hammond. "Sometimes we 
rush them a little too much." 
</P>
<P>
About two weeks of the health course are devoted to sex education. Students 
will be segregated for a one-week portion dealing with human sexuality and 
sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said that separating the sexes will cost about $4,500 for 
extra staff and equipment. The board agreed to review the plan after a year. 
</P>
<P>
District administrators had recommended that the trustees vote to continue 
teaching sex education in middle school to coeducational classes, even though 
the district's own recent survey shows that a majority of parents favor 
splitting the boys and girls into separate classes. 
</P>
<P>
They noted that the students overwhelmingly support coeducational sex education 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think we ought to hear what (the students) are saying," said Judy 
Cunningham, principal at Rancho San Joaquin Middle School. "We have very mature 
people that we expect a great deal from . . . that we expect to make heavy 
decisions in this particular course. They handle the situation really well." 
</P>
<P>
In the survey of parents, 57% of those polled said human sexuality should be 
taught in separate classes for boys and girls. But in a separate survey of 800 
middle-school students, 76% said they do not object to being in the same 
classroom as students of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education commissioned the community survey after several parents 
objected earlier this year to a new required health course for middle-school 
students in which the topics of drugs, AIDS, anorexia and sexual development 
are discussed. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fact that boys and girls were in the same classroom when the subject 
of human sexuality was discussed that seemed to bother parents the most, 
according to Board of Education President Margie Wakeham. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time the family life or human sexuality curriculum comes up for review, 
there is concern by the parents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wakeham and board member Helen Cameron favored keeping students together during 
sex education classes and separating them for only one day at the end of the 
course for a question-and-answer session. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a mistake for us educators to make (sex) a mystique that you 
can't talk about," Wakeham said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she believed students should be informed about human sexuality and 
allowed to ask questions "in the best, most honest, direct way possible." 
</P>
<P>
But board member Gordon G. Getchel, who led the move to segregate students for 
the week of sex education lessons, said the board should be responsive to 
parents' concerns because the topic -- unlike math or physics -- is one that 
has to do with the values of a family. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Supt. Bruce Givner noted that while the survey shows most parents want 
boys and girls taught separately during the human sexuality discussion of the 
12-week course, an overwhelming majority -- 91% -- said they agree that 
information regarding sexuality should be taught as part of a planned 
curriculum in the middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
Those parents who objected to combining the students for the discussions said 
they felt the students might be uncomfortable asking questions in a mixed 
group. But of those parents whose children have taken the course, only 27% said 
their children felt uncomfortable discussing sensitive topics in a class with 
both boys and girls present. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys were sent to 3,000 homes, but only 757 responded. The student surveys 
were conducted in the middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
Givner said the curriculum includes two sections called Stars and Stages, which 
show students how to resist peer pressure in a situation where drugs or sex 
come up, and how to deal with changes in their lives, such as those caused by a 
divorce in the family. 
</P>
<P>
Givner said that the schools work hard to let parents know what the students 
will hear and see during the course and that they also have the option of 
excluding their child from the portion of the health curriculum dealing with 
human sexuality and sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"People have many misperceptions," he said. "They think we're teaching the 
mechanics of sex, which is not the case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sex Education in the Classroom 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Unified School District asked the first question of parents and the 
remaining two questions of students. 
</P>
<P>

boys and girls. 
</P>
<P>
Strongly Disagree: 11.3% 
</P>
<P>
Disagree: 15.1% 
</P>
<P>
Strongly Agree: 34% 
</P>
<P>
Agree: 23% 
</P>
<P>
Undecided: 16.6% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2.Did you feel comfortable discussing human sexuality topics in class with both 
boys and girls present? 
</P>
<P>
No: 17.2% 
</P>
<P>
Yes: 82.8% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3.If you had a choice, would you rather be in a classroom with classmates of 
your same sex rather than a class composed of both boys and girls together? 
</P>
<P>
Yes: 24% 
</P>
<P>
76%

INSURANCE FORGERY ALLEGED;

<P>
SLAIN BOY'S MOTHER SUSPECTED OF FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mother accused of helping to forge her teen-age son's signature on an 
application for a $150,000 life insurance policy the day after he was slain was 
arrested Wednesday on suspicion of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Jean Brinson, 36, of Santa Ana was held on suspicion of attempted grand 
theft, fraud and conspiracy. Also suspected in the case are two insurance 
agents who allegedly helped her. 
</P>
<P>
Brinson's son, Latoris Andre, 16, was accidentally shot to death by a friend 
April 23, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A day later, the suspects allegedly forged the dead youth's name to an 
application for insurance with Northern Life Insurance, named the mother as the 
sole beneficiary and backdated the document to two days before the death. 
</P>
<P>
Also held in the case is Shontil Antoinette Lawrence, 35, an insurance agent 
who was arrested at her Santa Ana home Wednesday morning. An arrest warrant has 
been issued for Jesse Lewis Hunter, who is at large. Brinson surrendered 
Wednesday to police in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that all three participated equally in this," said Ronald E. 
Warthen, chief fraud investigator for the California Department of Insurance. 
"We had two insurance agents and a mother with a deceased son who turned out to 
be the catalyst for this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspected of Enlisting Help of Roommate 
</P>
<P>
Brinson and her friend, Lawrence, are suspected of concocting the plan and 
enlisting the help of Hunter, Lawrence's roommate, who prepared an insurance 
policy application. 
</P>
<P>
The policy named Brinson as sole beneficiary and was filed with Seattle's 
Northern Life Insurance, a company that employs Hunter as an agent. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the youth's death, Lawrence notified Northern Life that Latoris 
Brinson was dead. She then requested a claim for the money on behalf of Evelyn 
Brinson. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Life officials called investigators, because the application was just 
two days old. A handwriting analyst later found that the boy's signature had 
been forged. Investigators then questioned Brinson and Hunter about the 
forgery. 
</P>
<P>
"The mother admitted to everything," Warthen said. 
</P>
<P>
Brinson and Lawrence are being held on suspicion of insurance fraud, attempted 
grand theft and conspiracy, charges that could bring a sentence of up to 10 
years.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: NO EASY ANSWERS FOR TRAGIC ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gene Wojciechowski 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't the memory of a single pitch that killed Donnie Moore, as his agent 
claimed. Nor was it the newspaper coverage that followed that doomed forkball, 
as his former teammate incredibly suggested. Moore's life -- and apparent 
suicide -- was more complicated than that. 
</P>
<P>
There were injuries, some misunderstood, all of them painful. There was a 
recent failed comeback and the realization that his playing career, the only 
career he knew, might be finished at age 35. There were whispers of marital 
discord. 
</P>
<P>
All anyone knows for sure is that the troubled Moore was weary of life. Or 
scared of it. A single pull of the trigger proved that much. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tony Bober, a Newport Beach psychotherapist, is familiar with the plight of 
professional athletes as they make the difficult and usually forced transition 
from celebrity to citizen status. His extensive study and subsequent report 
detailing the problems encountered by National Football League players 
immediately after retirement is required reading for union and league 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Bober never met Moore; he didn't have to after learning of the circumstances of 
Tuesday's tragedy. The danger signs were evident, the formulas for disaster 
were securely in place. Moore, surmises Bober, wasn't crushed by the weight of 
one misfortune but by a dozen of them. Sadly, Bober had seen it happen before. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing that clicked in my head was that it was a replay of the Jim 
Tyrer story several years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrer, you might remember, was a former Kansas City Chief standout who 
committed suicide after failing to cope with the post-NFL experience. In a 
sense, said Bober, Moore's plight was no different. 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect, as a general rule, the closer you are to a critical point in 
your life, the more of a major impact it's going to have," he said. "The study 
(which examined the first six months of transition) confirmed that." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps David Pinter, who was Moore's agent, and Brian Downing, Moore's former 
Angel teammate, should glance at a copy of the report. Pinter might be 
surprised to learn that a man's life is determined by more than a pitch that 
may have cost the Angels a place in the 1986 World Series. And Downing, whom we 
thought knew better, might be shocked to know that Moore's decisions weren't 
dictated by the words of sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
Pinter maintains that Moore's infamous ninth-inning home run pitch to Boston's 
Dave Henderson forever haunted his client. He said he sought psychiatric 
assistance for the sensitive Moore, but that Moore resisted. In the end, Pinter 
says, "That home run killed him." 
</P>
<P>
It's possible, though unlikely, Bober said, that Moore could have been so 
profoundly affected by a forkball that landed on the wrong side of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"It would take more than one pitch," Bober said. "I think it makes for good 
copy and is kind of a quickie answer, but it doesn't tell the complete picture 
of what was happening to him as a person." 
</P>
<P>
About this notion of good copy, at least as professed by the noted journalism 
scholar, Downing: It was Downing who, when asked for a comment concerning 
Moore's death, said, "Out of deference to the man, I don't think I should talk 
to the people who are partly responsible for what happened to him." 
</P>
<P>
Sportswriters are many things -- insensitive and careless on occasion -- but we 
aren't accomplices to attempted murder and suicide. For Downing to suggest 
otherwise is sheer lunacy. 
</P>
<P>
In this instance, Downing, an avid weightlifter, brings new meaning to the 
term, "clean and jerk." 
</P>
<P>
Using Downing's ill-conceived logic, the blame for Moore's death also would be 
shared by Angel Owner Gene Autry, who once questioned the wisdom of his sizable 
financial investment in the oft-injured reliever. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Angel Vice President Mike Port asked, "What do we pay (Moore) a 
million dollars for?" That same year Moore found himself booed unmercifully by 
Angel faithful. And what of those Angel players who had a part in that fateful 
Game 5 against the Red Sox? Does Downing point an accusing finger in their 
direction, too? 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'd be standing here patting me on the back right now for saying 
this," Downing told reporters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pat or swat? Moore was smarter than that, certainly more complex (and 
distraught) than Downing or anyone else knew. He had a swagger about him and a 
gruff disposition that was sometimes betrayed by playful eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is gone and nobody -- not Pinter, not Downing, not even Bober -- will 
ever know why.

TOO GOOD?; 
</P>
<P>
HARVEY BLAMES HEALTHY ARM FOR WILD TIMES THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The smoke seldom clears when Bryan Harvey pitches anymore. That's because Angel 
Manager Doug Rader keeps lighting up, cigarette after nervous cigarette, while 
Harvey goes through his new routine of working counts full and then the bases 
full. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen walks in his past 10 appearances. Four of them in his most recent 
outing -- an excruciating eight-batter stint last Saturday that only set the 
scene for Mike Devereaux's incredible foul pole-bending home run. If Harvey 
were a starting pitcher, he'd be averaging nearly nine walks per complete game. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, he was the American League's rookie of the year runner-up. This 
year, he's only bidding to become the next Don Stanhouse, the former Baltimore 
Oriole and Dodger wild man who used to go by the apt nickname, Full Pack. 
</P>
<P>
So, Bryan Harvey, ace of the Angel bullpen, what gives? 
</P>
<P>
"It's my arm," Harvey says. "It feels too good." 
</P>
<P>
Come again? 
</P>
<P>
Come along, Harvey says, as he prepares to take you on a brief travelogue of 
his five-year professional pitching career. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Harvey broke in with Class-A Quad City and struck out 111, walking a 
mere 37, in 81 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"My arm hurt," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Harvey saved 15 games for Class-A Palm Springs, walking 38 in 57 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"My arm hurt again," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, he saved 20 games for Double-A Midland, striking out 78 and walking 28 
in 53 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I started the season on the DL," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1988, Harvey led the Angels in saves with 17 while walking just 20 in 76 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I ended the season on the DL," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey was placed there last September for the purpose of having bone chips 
removed from his pitching elbow. Surgery and rehabilitation complete, Harvey 
returned to the Angels this spring pain-free -- and, often in recent weeks, 
control-free. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I ain't hurtin'," Harvey complains, "I can't find home plate." 
</P>
<P>
According to Harvey, his arm feels so good, so strong, that he can't help but 
overthrow. The arm now knows no boundaries, including that of the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
"It kinda does feel like a new arm," he says. "Now, when I rare back and cut 
loose, I know there's nothing back there. I can go wide-open now. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe last year, that's why I stayed under control a little more." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from some frayed nerves and some jammed ashtrays, the Angel coaching 
staff doesn't appear overly concerned with Harvey's recent walk on the wild 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Just the opposite, it's become kind of a running gag among them. 
</P>
<P>
The other day in the visiting coaches dressing room in Toronto, bullpen coach 
Joe Coleman trotted out the routine for a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
'If he keeps struggling," Coleman said, "we're going to have Dr. (Lewis) Yocum 
put the bone chips back in." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Rader interrupted. "Bone-chip reversal." 
</P>
<P>
And from the back of the room, pitching coach Marcel Lachemann chimed in with, 
"It's the first time that surgery's ever been done. We're waiting for a 
transplant. I've got a bone spur he can have if he wants it." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey plays along, too, kidding about the pair of one-inning stints he 
completed last week without walking a batter. 
</P>
<P>
"Two innings without a walk," Harvey said in mock amazement. "A record." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Angels remain tied for first in the AL West, so there is no real 
urgency surrounding Harvey's wanderings yet. As Coleman points out, "He's still 
saved 12 out of 16 opportunities. That's still one of the best marks in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
And from Rader: "He's had a few awkward outings, but they're going to come. 
Look at (Cleveland's) Doug Jones. What did he give up the other night -- four 
runs in the ninth? Everybody does it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to succeed every time he goes out there. I imagine there are 
some, oh, modifications he'll need to make in his delivery, because his arm 
feels different. 
</P>
<P>
"But we just have to keep plugging him in there. Everybody goes through bad 
times. You just have to persevere and stay the course." 
</P>
<P>
And hope Harvey's new souped-up fastball does the same. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing of it is," Harvey says, "I haven't really been hit around lately. It 
could be a lot worse than it's been. I'm just walking guys. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been this strong in a while and I haven't been able to find a good 
groove. But I'm gonna find it. I thought it was (getting) close till 
Baltimore." 
</P>
<P>
One less walk by Harvey in Baltimore and maybe Devereaux never gets a chance to 
bat in the ninth ... and maybe umpire Jim Joyce never has to make a can't-win 
judgment call ... and maybe Rader never has to say all those inflammatory 
things about Frank Robinson's relationship with certain AL umpires. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the fire goin', didn't I?" Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
For Rader's sake, Harvey realizes he soon has to start putting fires out. This 
trip down Tobacco Road must end some time.

KELM HOPES HE CAN PASS TEST AS RAMS' SUCCESSOR TO EKERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fritz Shurmur has collected so many notes on defense through the years he 
finally tossed them all in a binder and shipped them off to a publisher. Alas, 
another how-to book was born. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken a fairly simply game and totally screwed it up," said Shurmur, 
author and defensive coordinator for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
It's one of the reasons Shurmur mourned the retirement of linebacker Carl Ekern 
this spring. Imagine a math teacher losing his favorite student. As inside 
linebackers go, Ekern was a relative scarecrow, a milkman's body in a football 
uniform. He lasted 13 seasons in the National Football League by understanding 
that the quickest way to a running back was first knowing where he was running. 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur has coached better players than Ekern. Faster and stronger ones. But 
Ekern was Shurmur's favorite by far. He played the game as Shurmur coached it 
from the sidelines. Ekern's game was one of sorting, dissecting, reacting and 
tackling. 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur is convinced you need several types of defensive player to succeed -- a 
delicate mixture of brain and brawn. 
</P>
<P>
It was to his delight that Larry Kelm of Texas A&amp;M was available in the 
fourth round in the NFL draft of 1987. Most of the free world had never heard 
of Kelm, but Shurmur knew pretty quickly he'd found the next Carl Ekern. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, he has groomed Kelm for the day Ekern would take his notes and 
retire. That day has come. To give you a clue about Kelm, he spent the 
off-season in Texas obtaining his degree in civil engineering. 
</P>
<P>
That's civil engineering as in three years of calculus and one year of 
something called differential equations. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons known only to him, Kelm has always loved math, which might give him 
a leg up in a Rams' defense that gets more complicated by the minute. 
</P>
<P>
Kelm doesn't profess that his skills as a mathematician come in handy when 
Roger Craig is barreling through the line with knees flailing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like you can get out a protractor and say, 'If I take this angle on a 
guy who runs the 40 in . . . ,"' Kelm said. 
</P>
<P>
But the discipline needed to learn calculus is the same discipline Kelm devotes 
to studying defenses. Now Kelm is by no means a wimp. He's 6-foot-4 and 240 
pounds and could rearrange a nose if the situation called for it. But you need 
more than muscle to run a defense. The game's complexities demand it. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern, who learned those lessons from Jack (Hacksaw) Reynolds, now passes the 
torch to Kelm. Ekern has stayed on this season as a volunteer coach. 
</P>
<P>
"In all honesty, I've always been pretty good at math," Ekern said. "Now, if 
you want to equate that to something, you'd be grasping." 
</P>
<P>
But how far? 
</P>
<P>
"It's like studying in school," Ekern explained about learning defense. "You 
can sit there with your book open for as long as you want. But if you're not 
absorbing anything, it's not doing you any good." 
</P>
<P>
Kelm has the ability to sit and absorb. He has spent two years as an apprentice 
under Ekern, following the veteran through his rituals of film-watching and 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"He applies himself," Ekern said of Kelm. "He's got a good grasp of it. I think 
he'll be good at leading a defense." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams certainly hope so. Inside linebacker is one of the keys to success 
this season. Kelm and Fred Strickland have been asked to replace veterans Ekern 
and Jim Collins, and perhaps Mark Jerue, who's rehabilitating from another knee 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry Kelm filling in for Carl Ekern is a big job," Coach John Robinson said. 
"I think Kelm is one of the most underrated players on this team. But he has to 
do that job." 
</P>
<P>
Kelm is eager to give it a shot, though no one has officially handed him the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting," he said. "There's a feeling of anxiety coming in. I've had 
plenty of time. There's no excuses for me." 
</P>
<P>
Kelm can't help but see a bit of Ekern in himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked that he was consistent," Kelm said. "I can relate that to me. I'm not 
the kind of guy with blazing speed. I'm not a real strong guy. But there was 
the way he studied film, and predicted plays. He was at the right place at the 
right time." 
</P>
<P>
Kelm also is excited at the prospect of being teamed with Strickland, the 
second-year linebacker from Purdue who showed signs of greatness near the end 
of last season. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be fun," he said. "He's an exciting kind of player. He has more 
ability than I do, I must say." 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur said there's a necessity for both kinds of player on a team. He likens 
Kelm's talents to an orchestra conductor. 
</P>
<P>
"He may not play any instrument real well, but he sure can get them to play 
together," Shurmur said. "He has a great ability to put a game together, to 
sort things out. And that's the guy you want in that position." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will travel to San Diego on July 30 for rookies-only scrimmage with 
the Chargers.. . . Coach John Robinson said the holdouts of first-round choices 
Bill Hawkins and Cleveland Gary won't become a serious problem if the players 
are signed by the time the team returns from Tokyo in early August. . . . The 
Rams are moving training camp from Cal State Fullerton to UC Irvine next season 
because of upcoming construction on an athletic sports complex at the Titan 
campus.

CATCHING WAVES

Craig Etchegoyen was barely 2 years old when he set his toy surfboard on the 
edge of his parents' swimming pool in Newport Beach, took a running start, 
jumped on the board and raced across the water. 
</P>
<P>
"After a week, I could go from one end of the pool to the other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His parents, Craig Sr., a former amateur surfer, and Sharon, a former gymnast, 
were amused as their son was with his new toy. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew Craigie had incredible balance," Etchegoyen Sr. said. 
</P>
<P>
And he knew his son was a surfer. 
</P>
<P>
By age 4, before most children can even swim, Etchegoyen already was learning 
how to surf in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, he had mastered the fundamental turns and maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
And now, after eight years of waves and wipeouts, the 12-year-old Etchegoyen 
glides across the toughest surf in Southern California and Hawaii with the ease 
of a veteran. 
</P>
<P>
For him, surfing has become more than amusement, or even a sport. It is his 
life style. 
</P>
<P>
"Surfing is all I do," said Etchegoyen, who now lifes in Corona del Mar. "I 
have all my fun when I'm surfing. I want to be great at something, and I know I 
have to work hard at it. It's like the Olympic gymnasts. All those kids have 
been doing it since they were 3. They spend hours working at it, and that's how 
they get into the Olympics and win gold medals." 
</P>
<P>
Etchegoyen Sr. said his son has focused all of his goals on surfing. He's the 
only one of six Etchegoyen children to take to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"He's never had a regimented athletic program besides surfing," Etchegoyen Sr. 
said. "That can hurt in a family environment. It creates such individualism. It 
creates the thought of 'It's just the surfboard, the waves and me.' A lot of 
surfers are like that." 
</P>
<P>
But few surfers stand 4-feet-7, have a 3.9 grade-point average on a 4.0 scale, 
regulated training diets and corporate sponsors who pay for equipment and 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
All this attention and money whirls like a swell around a pint-sized boy with 
sandy-blond hair, freckles and gallons of potential. 
</P>
<P>
After just two years of surfing competitively, Etchegoyen already is 
approaching the 50-victory mark. He has so many trophies that he has to store 
them in boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Etchegoyen is ranked second in the nation in his age group, has won 70% of 
competitions he has entered and has missed only one final. He's hoping to add 
another victory this week at the U.S. Surfing Championships at Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
One could call Etchegoyen the Todd Marinovich of surfing. Just as Marinovich -- 
now at USC -- was nurtured to be a college quarterback at Mater Dei and 
Capistrano Valley high schools, Etchegoyen is surrounded by coaches, trainers 
and specialists to help him reach his goal of becoming a world-champion surfer. 
</P>
<P>
All of Etchegoyen's surfboards, which stand 5-foot-1 and weigh only four 
pounds, are shaped by hand. Every year, he goes through 15 to 20 boards and 10 
custom-made wet suits. Sponsors pay for his clothing, contest entries and 
travel, which includes as many as seven trips to Hawaii each year. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors invest nearly $25,000 a year in Etchegoyen, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
But his training goes much further than equipment and sponsors. A nutritionist 
monitors his diet, which consists of high-carbohydrate foods, fruits and 
vegetables. Red meats and junk food are strictly off limits, but Etchegoyen is 
prone to sneak a chicken fajita on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Etchegoyen has to watch his diet. He ballooned to a pudgy 90 pounds at age 7 
but now weighs in at a trim 78. 
</P>
<P>
"He understands that he can't starve himself," Etchegoyen Sr. said. "He eats in 
the morning, even when he's not hungry." 
</P>
<P>
His son burns most of his energy at the beach. He works out alone three times a 
week, trains with the Quiksilver surfing team twice a week and spends one day 
competing in team contests. He takes one day to rest. 
</P>
<P>
Etchegoyen Sr. says Quiksilver coaches do a better job of training his son than 
he did. A semi-retired land developer, he still attends workouts regularly and 
accompanies his son to contests. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad really worked hard at this," Etchegoyen said. "He still does. It's 
almost as if his whole schedule revolves around me. Dad has taught me about how 
everything goes with the current and the side currents." 
</P>
<P>
Etchegoyen Sr. said he put too much pressure on his son when he was training 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a high-energy guy," Etchegoyen Sr. said. "But that turns into nerves with 
him. The Quiksilver coaches handle him like he was one of their children. He's 
like one of the family, but they don't spoil him." 
</P>
<P>
Quiksilver Team Manager Richard Woolcott, who has coached Etchegoyen for 1 1/2 
years, said Etchegoyen has "world championship potential." 
</P>
<P>
"He works his butt off in surfing," Woolcott said. "He's a good kid. He has a 
good head on his shoulders and you don't see that very often, especially in 
surfing. 
</P>
<P>
"His whole life he's been building himself to become a top competitive surfer. 
He's born and bred to be one." 
</P>
<P>
Etchegoyen merely shrugs when asked about his potential. 
</P>
<P>
"People will see the improvement in my surfing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even 12-year-olds can be modest. 
</P>
<P>
More than just his father and coach realize Etchegoyen's potential. At a recent 
team banquet, Quiksilver members voted Etchegoyen the most likely to be the 
next Tom Carroll, the two-time pro world champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to follow in his footsteps," Etchegoyen said. "But I don't want to be 
him. I want my own style. But it wouldn't be bad to be a two-time world 
champion." 
</P>
<P>
All the grooming and sponsorship could pay off 10-fold when Etchegoyen joins 
the professional ranks. He should turn pro sometime between 16 and 18, 
Etchegoyen Sr. said. 
</P>
<P>
Top pro surfers can earn as much as $300,000 to $400,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time Craigie turns pro," his father said, "they'll be making a 
half-million bucks a year." 
</P>
<P>
But first, Etchegoyen must pay a different kind of debt. He trained at Rocky 
Point, Hawaii, for two weeks last year and will work out on the islands as many 
as seven times this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble with a lot of kids is they're not paying their dues in Hawaii," 
Woolcott said. "But his dad has all corners covered. He's around the right 
people in the industry. He's right on target." 
</P>
<P>
Etchegoyen has avoided any serious injury while surfing, despite a sometimes 
kamikaze approach. When he started trying aerial maneuvers when he was 8, his 
father had to stop him. Too much. Too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"He's fast and powerful," Etchegoyen Sr. said. "He has unbelievable timing. He 
has never hesitated from trying anything. Sometimes he's too courageous. It 
scares me." 
</P>
<P>
Etchegoyen Sr. said his son "is totally unmotivated competing against kids his 
own age." 
</P>
<P>
Woolcott believes Etchegoyen can polish his existing skills. But he fears 
Etchegoyen could be burned out before he turns pro. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there's too much pressure put on him," he said. "He can get really 
bummed out if doesn't do well in a final. But I tell him, 'Hey, surfing is a 
life style. You should never get upset when you lose.' For him, it's all or 
nothing, and that's not good for someone his age. 
</P>
<P>
"We must give him a lot of (room). We want to push him, but we also want him to 
enjoy the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Woolcott said Etchegoyen's only weaknesses is his upper-body strength. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so small can't keep up with bigger guys paddling," Woolcott said. "So he 
can't get as good of a wave selection. Once he's able to get wave quota, he'll 
be unstoppable." 
</P>
<P>
Woolcott, 23, is patient with Etchegoyen because he surfed at the same level 
only a decade before. He placed third in the world amateur championships in 
1984, but his career was cut short when he broke his neck in a surfing accident 
a year later. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to drill into a kid his age," Woolcott said. "But his surfing will 
change over the next few years. He has the foundation. He just needs to do his 
maneuvers with more power." 
</P>
<P>
Etchegoyen's success already has drawn national attention. He was featured on a 
national sports program last spring and will appear on the cover of Young 
People Today, a new children's magazine, this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make sure that this doesn't go to his head," Etchegoyen Sr. said. 
"He receives an enormous amount of attention. People run up to him on the beach 
and ask about him. He's a little celebrity on these beaches." 
</P>
<P>
Etchegoyen wants to use that status to project an image of clean-cut surfers. 
He said he's irritated by the stereotype of surfers as lazy, unemployed drug 
users with long hair and bad grades. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what really makes me mad," he said. "People don't project the right 
image about surfing. There are still people who go on TV and act weird. And 
that's what people put in their minds. People think they all do drugs and go 
out and party all night. 
</P>
<P>
"Many surfers own businesses. They're athletes and they take the sport 
seriously. I don't talk weird and say 'dude' all the time. I never did drugs 
and never will. I fit the image of a surfer who has fun." 
</P>
<P>
And one who keeps winning.

TESTING ASKED FOR SUSPECT SWITCHES USED IN MISSILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHACHTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy -- ignoring Pentagon investigators' warnings -- has permitted a 
missile manufacturer to continue using electronic switches whose faulty 
production by a small Southland firm could render the missiles' warheads 
useless, the head of a congressional oversight panel has charged. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich), in a letter released Wednesday, asked Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney to order independent testing of the inexpensive switches 
made by Asher Engineering Corp. in Baldwin Park to determine the harm, if any, 
done by alleged shoddy manufacturing practices. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst case, Dingell warned, flaws in the switches could force the 
"recall of seven years of missile production." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported in March that Asher's failure to properly test the tiny 
switches, which cost less than $20 each, had Pentagon officials concerned about 
the effectiveness of many of the tactical missiles in the U.S. arsenal. The 
switches are a critical piece of the firing mechanisms in Phoenix, Harm, 
Harpoon, AAMRAM, Standard, Sidewinder and Maverick missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its 
investigations subcommittee, said the Navy ignored critical audits of Asher by 
its own investigators in issuing a waiver last month that allowed Texas 
Instruments to install the switches in more than 350 Harm missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, the Navy's top quality-control official added his own 
objections, warning that test results to date did not justify using the 
switches and that their use posed "potential serious hazard to personnel, 
aircraft and missiles," according to an internal Navy memo released by the 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees No Problem 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department and Navy spokesmen declined to comment Wednesday on 
Dingell's letter. A Texas Instruments official, however, said the switches had 
been thoroughly tested and that none had failed. 
</P>
<P>
"The missile is warrantied, and we make sure the parts are good before we use 
them," said G. Dean Clubb, senior vice president and missile systems manager 
for Texas Instruments' defense systems and electronics group in Dallas. "There 
is no doubt in my mind these (switches) will certainly meet the needs of the 
missile system." 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Criminal Investigative Service has recommended that federal 
prosecutors in Los Angeles seek indictments of officials of Asher and Micronics 
International, a Brea company that is the prime contractor for the missile 
firing mechanisms of which Asher's switches are a part, according to William G. 
Dupree, the Pentagon's deputy assistant inspector general for investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell's letter said the Defense Department investigators have found that the 
switches did not meet military specifications, that they had not been tested 
correctly and that Asher was using equipment that had not been checked against 
Pentagon standards for as long as seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Asher, president of the firm, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
He told The Times in March that Micronics officials, under pressure from the 
military to deliver firing mechanisms on time, had ordered Asher employees to 
falsely certify that the switches met government specifications. 
</P>
<P>
Micronics since last fall has been the subject of a criminal investigation of 
alleged short cuts in its manufacture of firing mechanisms for the Phoenix 
missile. The Times reported in October that flaws in the devices had forced the 
Navy to mothball 500 missiles worth $425 million until replacement parts could 
be installed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passed Both Tests 
</P>
<P>
Micronics officials have denied any wrongdoing. G. Addison Appleby, chairman 
and chief executive of Micronics' parent company, La Jolla-based Precision 
Aerotech, said Wednesday that he knew of no grounds on which Micronics could be 
indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Like Clubb, Appleby said the Asher switches had passed tests conducted by both 
the Navy and independent labs. The only certifications signed by Asher 
officials, he added, were those requested by the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my understanding the problem is all in paper work," Appleby said. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, however, Dingell said the testing of the switches was suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been some limited functional testing done to date that indicates the 
switches work," he said. "However, these tests are tainted by allegations that 
the switches were handpicked and not representative of Asher production. In 
fact, it is alleged that the testers were directed to 'find some switches that 
work.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dingell said Cheney needed to be alert to bureaucratic tendencies in the 
Pentagon to overlook flaws in the switches. 
</P>
<P>
"The possible recall of seven years' worth of missile production will create 
tremendous pressure within the system to use the substandard or defective 
components," Dingell said in the letter. One admiral, he said, told the 
subcommittee that fleet commanders "would rather have missiles that do not work 
than no missiles at all."

BRIGHT OUSTED AT IRVINE FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
NEW CHAIRMAN, CEO NAME BY NATIONAL EDUCATION CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two days after it reported an unexpected $1.5-million second-quarter loss, 
National Education Corp. on Wednesday announced that David C. Jones, a former 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has replaced H. David Bright as chairman 
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Jones -- a retired Air Force general and chairman of the Joint Chiefs from 1978 
to 1982 -- will fill the CEO position only temporarily until a permanent 
successor is found, according to a statement released by the Irvine-based 
company, the nation's largest provider of educational training services. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 68, has served as a director of National Education since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
National Education executives were unavailable for comment. Bright, reached at 
his home, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, National Education has suffered a series of setbacks. On 
Monday, the company reported a $1.5-million loss for the quarter ended June 30, 
contrasted with a $7.6-million profit in the same period a year earlier. 
Revenue was down 8%, to $96.6 million from $105 million. 
</P>
<P>
The root of the problems, according to analysts, is the company's largest 
subsidiary, Applied Learning International. National Education formed the 
company from several acquisitions it made in the mid-1980s. The goal was to 
become a major player in the corporate training industry, but numerous 
problems, including computer snafus and a disorganized sales staff, have 
stymied that effort. 
</P>
<P>
Applied Learning's President William Roach resigned last September after 
bitterly clashing with Bright over the direction of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Education's core business -- vocational schools -- is 
suffering too. Enrollments have been flat for most of the year, and the company 
is having to spend more on marketing to attract students. 
</P>
<P>
Bright was hired in 1972 by company founder John J. McNaughton to help the 
company reverse a string of losses. He was successful in overhauling National 
Education and was named its chairman in 1988. Bright will remain a director of 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
Although the management change was not announced until after the stock market 
closed Wednesday, National Education's common shares -- which took a drubbing 
Tuesday -- rebounded a bit Wednesday to close at $15, up 50 cents for the day 
in light trading. The management change was announced after the stock market 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
The stock had closed Tuesday at $14.50, down $2.25, with nearly 2.3 million 
shares changing hands in the wake of Monday's disappointing financial report.

CONSUMER PRICES SHOW JUNE RISE OF ONLY 0.2%; 
</P>
<P>
5-MONTH INFLATIONARY SURGE ABRUPTLY ENDS WITH SMALLEST INCREASE OF THE PAST 16 
MONTHS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Consumer prices rose only 0.2% in June as a five-month surge in oil and food 
prices came to an abrupt end, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The June increase in the consumer price index was the smallest in 16 months and 
was widely welcomed by financial markets and by economists who earlier this 
year had feared that surging inflation had become endemic in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street, stocks soared to their highest levels since the October, 1987, 
crash, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 39.65 points to 2,584.41. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
0.3% Price Rises Seen 
</P>
<P>
"Food and energy inflation is behind us and should be out of the picture the 
rest of the year," said Donald Ratajczak, economic forecaster and inflation 
specialist at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "Without food and energy, 
we'll probably be in the 0.3%-a-month (increase) range the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices, which had jumped more than 20% during the first five months of 
1989, fell 1% in June. Food prices, which had been accelerating at an annual 
rate of almost 7% as a result of the drought, rose only 0.2% last month. 
</P>
<P>
More significant, the "core" rate of consumer price inflation, which excludes 
the volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2%. That puts it on track toward an 
annual rate of 4.5% this year, lower than the 1988 mark of 4.7% and well within 
the yearly range of 3.8% to 4.8% that has prevailed since inflation was tamed 
in 1982-83. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metropolitan area, prices in June rose 
0.3%. Higher shelter costs -- up 1.4% over the previous month -- were blamed 
for most of the increase. Without the effects of those costs, the local area 
index would have dropped 0.2% because of lower prices for apparel, gasoline, 
food and beverages and personal care items. Medical care costs rose 0.7% in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"We think inflation has been tamed for this year and maybe for this business 
cycle," said Lynn Reaser of First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "It now 
appears that the main reason for the higher inflation we had was the surge in 
oil and the strong rise in food prices. But non-food, non-energy is now showing 
about the same rate as 1988." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consumers Reject High Prices 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, she said, the Federal Reserve can conclude safely that its 
campaign to restrict money and tighten interest rates, begun in March, 1988, 
has not only slowed the economy but, more important to those who fear an 
inflationary burst, "has begun to affect prices, too." 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Reaser said, the Fed should be able to respond quickly with lower 
rates and expanded money supply if the economy slumps too severely later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The underlying rate of inflation has been around 4% pretty much since we 
knocked it down there in '83, except for wiggles up or down caused by food and 
energy," Ratajczak said. "So it really looks as though the Fed has succeeded in 
making sure the oil prices and the drought effects on food did not get embedded 
in the system this time. Consumers are not buying when prices get too high." 
</P>
<P>
An important factor in the price moderation in June, he pointed out, was an 
event that has occurred every summer in recent years: Buyers have revolted 
against spring clothing price increases, which translates into steep discounts 
in June or July. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's report, Labor Department statisticians estimated that clothing 
prices in general fell 1.1% in June and that prices of women's clothing tumbled 
2.2%. Before seasonal adjustment, which is intended to smooth out the steeper 
zigzags in price movements, women's clothing prices dropped 3.9% and prices for 
clothing generally fell 2.2%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disinflation Showing Up' 
</P>
<P>
"This report is very encouraging in that disinflation is showing up," said 
Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., who only a few months ago was 
warning that a pattern of 1970s-style stagflation was setting in. At that time, 
Sinai expressed concern that, although the economy was cooling rapidly, higher 
inflation appeared to have embedded itself in the system. 
</P>
<P>
The June report "hints that the weaker economy may have a wider impact on 
inflation more quickly than has been the case historically. It seems prices are 
more sensitive these days to changes in the economy than may have been true in 
the past and that businesses have been able to contain wage inflation more 
quickly than before." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "On one month's report, it's too early to get too optimistic about 
inflation, but it's not too early to ask whether we may not be on track to 
quicker moderation of inflation. If inflation could unwind to an annual rate of 
4% off a weak economy or a shallow downturn, that would be a small price to 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Soft Landing' Possible 
</P>
<P>
In effect, Sinai suggested, the hoped-for "soft landing" may still be possible. 
That is, the Fed may manage to slow the economy gently enough to tame inflation 
without sending the country into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be very satisfying to (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan, who has been 
trying to balance growth to inflation in an era in which external things like 
oil prices have mucked it up," Sinai said. "But now food and energy are out of 
the index. The only question mark will be if wage costs put too high a floor 
under price inflation." 
</P>
<P>
Before seasonal adjustment, the consumer price index rose in June to 124.1. 
This means that a cross section of goods and services costing $100 during the 
1982-84 base period cost $124.10 in June.

Orange County companies continued to gobble up office space during the first 
six months of 1989, especially in the smaller, less-plush facilities, according 
to a report issued Tuesday by Grubb &amp; Ellis Co. 
</P>
<P>
The county vacancy rate for research and development space, usually defined as 
industrially zoned property used for both manufacturing and office, has fallen 
from 26% in 1986 to under 14% today, the commercial real estate broker said. 
</P>
<P>
Grubb &amp; Ellis said many developers stopped building the R&amp;D properties, 
which are often used by small manufacturers who don't want separate office and 
factory locations, because the market was glutted. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of vacant offices in the county has also declined in the last 
year, from 24% in mid-1988 to 21% today, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves more than 10 million square feet of empty office space in the 
county. Another 5 million square feet of office space is under construction and 
about 10 million more is on the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SECOND-QUARTER SURVEY OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPACE IN COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
Grubb &amp; Ellis estimates there are 53.5 million square feet of research and 
development space in Orange County, with an additional 1.1 million square feet 
under construction. Research and development space is usually defined as 
industrially zoned property used for both manufacturing and office.

<TEXT>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Co., Irvine, reported earnings of $18 
million for the second quarter of 1989, contrasted with a loss of $22 million 
for the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The company said this is the first time that the company has made a profit in 
the second quarter or the first half in six years and credited the performance 
to increased sales and lower operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue declined 8%, to $278 million from $303 million. The company attributed 
the decrease to businesses the company no longer owns. The company last year 
reorganized its business units into four divisions. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1989, McDonnell Douglas Information Systems earned $9 
million, up from a loss of $50 million in the first six months of 1988. Revenue 
dropped 6%, to $559 million from $594 million. 
</P>

'MAD HOUSERS' DELIVER SHELTER FOR THE HOMELESS

"You can't beat the price. By the end of the day, someone will have a house for 
about $40," says Brian Finkle as he helps his crew pound the roof in place. The 
house -- a 6-by-8-foot plywood box -- is just large enough for a mattress and 
some personal possessions, but it does keep out the wind and the rain. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, burly Finkle is not a typical construction chief with typical 
workers. Most of his crew wear button-down business clothes Monday through 
Friday and work as architects, accountants, industrial designers or social 
workers. But every other Saturday, they don green sweat shirts that say, "We're 
Nuts About Huts" and meet in an old warehouse to build plywood shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Finkle, an architect who just earned his master's degree, is the president of 
the Mad Housers, an energetic band of 15 young professionals determined to do 
something about Atlanta's growing homeless problem. The group was organized two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The huts are just a Band-Aid solution, but at least they get people off the 
streets and out of the cold," Finkle says as he quickly drives a nail into a 2 
by 4. "We usually build two huts a month, but I'd like to start building 
three." 
</P>
<P>
The Mad Housers have erected 54 huts, which are placed in obscure areas around 
the city. They work in donated warehouse space and use scrap materials and 
lumber they have salvaged from local construction sites. As soon as they 
complete the walls, floor and roof, they load the panels into a '73 pickup and 
drive off to the selected site, where they put the hut together. 
</P>
<P>
What these weekend carpenters do is illegal, because the huts are built on 
government or private property and do not comply with city codes. But in the 
past two years, the group has provided shelter for between 100 and 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
The Mad Housers have also brought the plight of the homeless to public 
attention. Dubbed the unsung heroes of the homeless, they have received 
national media coverage; been recognized by the Georgia chapter of the American 
Institute of Architects and by Architectural Record, a national journal, and 
won numerous awards. One is the Giraffe Award, a plaque given to groups and 
individuals who stick their necks out for community service and the betterment 
of mankind. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Mad Housers addressed the American Institute of Architects' Housing 
Conference in Washington and four other members built and displayed a hut 
recently in New York at an exhibit entitled "If You Lived Here." They also 
constructed two huts in the city. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, some city officials reacted to the Housers' activities as an 
infraction of the law. Atlanta's Department of Parks, Recreation and Cultural 
Affairs tore down two huts built near a residential area, and the Georgia 
Department of Transportation razed one built on access land. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the huts, which are scattered throughout the downtown area, are 
left undisturbed by the city. The underground construction crew seems to have 
an informal alliance with local officials and the city police. Architect Mike 
Connors, a founder and former president of the group, says: "City officials 
have been very supportive and open-minded. They could have passed stronger 
vagrancy laws, but they've let the huts stand." 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young honored the Mad Housers and promised 
them a $30,000 community block grant to build a pair of two-person bungalows 
with complete facilities. But the group must first obtain tax-exempt status 
before it can claim the grant and begin building. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Phillips, an anthropologist and secretary of the group, says inquiries 
about building huts and low-cost housing have come from England and West 
Germany, as well as from people across the country. "In the past year and a 
half, we've sent out close to 75 starter kits," she says. Kits include hut 
designs, lists of materials and advice to groups on selecting a site and 
getting tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The inspiration for forming Mad Housers came from Finkle and Mike Connors, who, 
as graduate students at Georgia Tech, got the idea while writing their master's 
theses on homeless shelters in Atlanta. After looking at some of the makeshift 
cardboard huts people built to avoid going to city shelters, Connors and Finkle 
decided they could help build better, more durable huts. Along with three other 
architectural students, they erected the first hut. 
</P>
<P>
The group worked closely with Jim and Anita Beatty, the directors of Atlanta's 
Task Force for the Homeless, to learn where the homeless were located. Anita 
Beatty says: "They're a gutsy group -- they're demonstrating the irony of Third 
World kind of housing in a First World country. They're also making a strong 
political statement for the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the homeless were skeptical. "Clients wanted to know how much the 
huts cost, what kind of forms they had to fill out and if we were going to 
preach to them," Phillips recalls. Now that the Mad Housers have become a 
familiar group around the city, many of the homeless seek them out and are even 
on a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
Finkle explains: "We try to get the homeless to help build their own huts, so 
they have a sense of ownership and learn how to make repairs. They also help 
pick a site -- it's important to put . . . (the huts) where they want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the huts are built within an easy walk of downtown Atlanta. Many are 
along railroad tracks, in abandoned lots and under bridges or viaducts -- in 
areas where the homeless already gather and live. 
</P>
<P>
Notes Cabell Heyward, an industrial designer with the Mad Housers: "We try to 
build (the huts) close to a water supply, soup kitchen, bus line, labor pool 
and canning route."

"I'm independent. I can come and go as I please here, and I've got a place to 
put all of my stuff," says James, pointing to his plywood box built by the Mad 
Housers. 
</P>
<P>
His home is a small hut covered with carpet remnants and plastic, and crammed 
with blankets and clothes. His hut is one of three standing in a littered lot 
less than half a mile from the regional headquarters of the Federal Reserve 
Bank. The huts, which are hidden by a mangled wire fence and a pile of rubble, 
are accessible only by foot. 
</P>
<P>
James and his neighbors get their water from a nearby office building, and they 
shower and wash their clothes at the city's labor pool. The wire fence doubles 
as a clothesline. 
</P>
<P>
They eat at one of Atlanta's soup kitchens, where they also pick up their mail. 
Sometimes they cook on the makeshift grill that they have built with some old 
screening and a couple of large bricks. In the winter, they usually build a 
fire in one of the large drums standing close by and wrap themselves in 
blankets. 
</P>
<P>
Before moving into the hut a year and a half ago, James, who has been homeless 
for three years, slept in abandoned houses and under bridges. Although he had 
been in several different shelters, he disliked the regimentation. "I didn't 
want somebody telling me when to go to bed and when to get up," he said. "It 
was like being in prison." 
</P>
<P>
A quiet-spoken but articulate man, he has spent time in the military and held a 
variety of jobs. He has also spent five years in the Arkansas State 
Penitentiary, serving a sentence for armed battery. 
</P>
<P>
But he says he was innocent of the charge. "It was a setup. I was framed." He 
hopes to reopen the case and overturn the conviction so he can clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, James goes to one of the labor pools and works for a day or two. 
But he has had health problems related to his stay in prison. He spends most of 
his time working as the unofficial coordinator for the Mad Housers, referring 
new clients and helping build huts. 
</P>
<P>
"After I get my court case settled, I'd like to save up enough money to get an 
apartment," he says. "I want to work with the homeless and someday write a book 
about living on the streets in America." KRISTINE F. ANDERSON

JOSEPH N. BELL: 2 ORANGE COUNTIES AND 2 DISTINCT WAYS OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you say, "I'm from Orange County" anywhere east of Baton Rouge, La., your 
listener will assume you're talking about Orange County, Fla. It's rather like 
telling a New Yorker that you work for "The Times." 
</P>
<P>
Our counterpart in Florida has a number of things in common with us. We both 
have temperate climates, conservative politics, a history of citrus production, 
a lot of tourists and a debt to Walt Disney. As far as I could observe after 
four days in Orange County, Fla., that's where the similarities end. If our 
roots are common, we have been growing -- with the exception of political 
orientation -- in rather different directions. 
</P>
<P>
While Orange County, Calif., has become one of the world's leading centers of 
high technology, higher education and industry, Orange County, Fla., has 
increasingly focused its attention -- with a nod toward agriculture and high 
technology -- on a single, massive industry: tourism. 
</P>
<P>
The catalyst for all this growth is, of course, Walt Disney World, a 
28,000-acre site about 20 miles southwest of the county seat of Orlando. So 
far, 6,600 of those acres have been developed and 7,200 will be preserved as a 
wilderness area. The remainder will undoubtedly be turned into further tourist 
attractions limited only by the ingenuity of Disney planners to devise ways of 
separating the 20 million people who visit this area annually from as many 
bucks as possible. 
</P>
<P>
When Disney built Disneyland in Anaheim, he made one grievous economic error: 
He didn't acquire at the same time the land for 10 or so miles around his 
amusement park. Maybe he couldn't afford it. Or maybe even Walt Disney couldn't 
foresee the phenomenal success of Disneyland. At any rate, he didn't make the 
same mistake in Florida. When he built the Magic Kingdom, then followed up 
immediately with Epcot Center, he had the prescience to acquire the surrounding 
land as well. As result, Walt Disney World is one of the world's most 
successful examples of the tail wagging the dog. 
</P>
<P>
The dog, of course, is Orange County, Fla., and the once sleepy central Florida 
town called Orlando that is its main population center. Today, that once-sleepy 
town is the hub of an entertainment complex and tourist paradise probably 
unmatched anywhere in the world. Although Disney World is the main attraction 
(and also the state of Florida's largest employer), it is by no means the only 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando's official tour guide offers 90 pages of accommodations and attractions 
including such non-Disney theme parks as Cypress Gardens, Sea World, Silver 
Springs, Busch Gardens, Boardwalk and Baseball -- and even the nearby Kennedy 
Space Center. (Disney has also added River Country, Discovery Island and 
Typhoon Lagoon to its three major theme parks.) 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest news in Orange County, Fla., is the opening next year of the 
MCA Universal Studios-Florida tour and the parallel growth in the number of 
film projects being attracted to Orlando by the Universal and Disney 
facilities. The Orlando mayor was even moved the other day to predict that 
within 50 years, people will be referring to Hollywood as Orlando West. MCA is 
pumping $500 million into its Florida tour, all the while grousing that the 
Disney-MGM Studio park was conceived and rushed to completion to torpedo 
Universal. But after four days of observing crowds at Disney World, I have no 
doubt there will be plenty of people to go around for both facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Orlando is dealing with growing pains and handling some of them a 
lot more efficiently than we have demonstrated in California. 
</P>
<P>
For example, while we were doing our tourist number in Florida, Orlando won 
approval from the state to build a 300-m.p.h. train to carry passengers from 
Orlando International Airport to Epcot Center. It is expected to be operational 
within four years, and, measured against past achievements, probably will be. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it was announced that the Orlando airport had the fastest 
growth rate in the United States in 1988, and now ranks 17th among the nation's 
busiest airports. The same week, the state Legislature authorized funds to 
build a 40,000-seat stadium in Orlando to use as bait for seeking a 
major-league baseball team in 1990. (Orlando already has a National Basketball 
Assn. team that will begin play next year.) 
</P>
<P>
You can feel the electricity in Orlando that grows out of the conviction that 
there is an inexhaustible supply of people carrying money who will happily come 
and spend it as long as it is made easy and attractive for them. The Floridians 
riding this wave can scarcely be faulted for their optimism; the crowds keep 
growing and the money keeps pouring in by exponential numbers each year. 
</P>
<P>
But at least to this Orange County Californian, there is no sense of envy. They 
can have it. No matter how many bulldozers they bring in, the Floridians can't 
create the mountains or the desert or the special kind of vitality and variety 
that fuels the Southern California economy and life style. I sensed that the 
depth and breadth of Florida living is as flat as the terrain. And the rough 
edges that make for interesting living seemed to me to be missing, leaving a 
kind of one-dimensional blandness. 
</P>
<P>
So there is no real sense of competition between these two Orange counties, the 
width of a continent apart. We're on very different tracks, and their 
destination seems -- at this moment, at least -- to be much more clearly 
defined than ours. 
</P>
<P>
I like it better our way.

SCIENTIST'S EVOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
BIOLOGIST WALTER FITCH, ONE OF UCI'S NEWEST STARS, STILL LOOKING FOR CHALLENGES 
-- AND ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Who knows why or when a child's mind switches from the more mundane pleasures 
of youth and fixes on something as weighty as science? 
</P>
<P>
Even as he tries to pinpoint the moment when it happened to him, renowned 
molecular evolutionist Walter Fitch can only make some educated guesses as he 
thumbs through the pages of his childhood. He knows that part of the answer is 
that he was a scrawny kid who realized early on that if he were to leave 
footprints, they wouldn't be on the athletic field. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but books. With them, he was as swift as the other kids. With them, his 
mind raced. 
</P>
<P>
One of them he read as a child was a single-volume encyclopedia. On one page 
were lots of little drawings. 
</P>
<P>
"Every drawing had a flaw that violated something about nature," Fitch said. 
"For example, one had a flag and a smokestack beside each other, and the flag 
was clearly blowing one direction and the smoke was blowing in another 
direction. You were supposed to figure out what the flaw was. Those just 
fascinated me, and I remember poring over them, figuring out what was wrong 
with each of those pictures. And I started asking questions. My mother must 
have been very patient, answering my questions of 'Why?' " 
</P>
<P>
Young Walter Fitch never really stopped asking why, coming to realize with each 
passing year the wisdom in the aphorism he heard as a child -- namely, that 
every time a scientist answers a question, he raises 10 more. 
</P>
<P>
He put that bit of truth in his knapsack and has kept it all along the trails 
of his life -- trails that have led him now, at age 60 and the father of three 
grown children, to a perch among the tall trees that represent the country's 
leading molecular evolutionists. 
</P>
<P>
These are the scientists still tracking the 3 1/2-billion-year-old evolutionary 
history of the species. While early evolutionists studied the evolutionary 
chain largely through fossil remains and by comparing the physiology of 
species, molecular evolutionists study it under a microscope, examining 
similarities and differences in species' molecular compositions. 
</P>
<P>
Now a professor at the University of Southern California, Fitch will join UCI's 
department of ecology and evolutionary biology around Oct. 1 at an annual 
salary of $93,000. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the prestigious National Academy of Science, Fitch would add weight 
to a UCI department that already includes nationally respected population 
geneticist Francisco Ayala, himself a member of the NAS's hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Fitch's move down the San Diego Freeway to Irvine will come after only three 
years at USC, a tenure that followed nearly a quarter-century at the University 
of Wisconsin, where he began his academic career as an assistant professor. 
</P>
<P>
Fitch has become a hot property in a field of science where the final answers 
lie not around the corner but most likely into the next century and beyond. 
Prestige and money are to be had for the people who know how to get those 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
At Wisconsin, they didn't need the chemistry building to fall on them to see it 
coming. Ultimately, said Harry Karavolas, the chairman of the physiological 
chemistry department where Fitch built his reputation, the school couldn't 
afford him. 
</P>
<P>
"Walter started to develop into an international scientist, and the campus has 
got limited resources here," Karavolas said. "The last few years was when he 
really grew, and at that time he was looking for bigger and better things. 
Those bigger and better things were not available here on campus. Our 
highest-paid professors, and some are Nobel Prize winners, didn't get the money 
he got at USC." Karavolas said Fitch doubled his Madison salary when he moved 
to Los Angeles. Fitch said only that USC made him an offer he "couldn't 
refuse." 
</P>
<P>
But Fitch left on a wave of good will. He is remembered in Madison as a 
quick-witted, unassuming professor who "represented the Wisconsin idea, where 
professors don't wear their epaulets on their shoulders," Karavolas said. 
</P>
<P>
And while Fitch said he now envisions retiring at UCI (just as he had once 
expected to retire at USC), Karavolas isn't so sure. "He's now in that group of 
scientists who basically aren't attached to any university. They go from place 
to place representing a group that's pursuing a particular area of science that 
knows no bounds." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Karavolas humorously suggested, one of the most important things a 
prospective employer can offer scientists of Fitch's caliber is "access to a 
good airport." 
</P>
<P>
Leaning back in his chair in his rather spare laboratory/office at USC, Fitch 
is not overdressed for a scheduled interview. He is wearing a pullover shirt, 
shorts and tennis shoes and is munching on an apple. In the background, 
classical music plays low on a portable radio that sits under bookshelves with 
tomes on genetics and molecular biology. All in all, quite a snapshot of the 
Scholar As Everyman With Classical Tastes. 
</P>
<P>
But he's not affecting a pose -- a former colleague at Wisconsin said that had 
you walked in unannounced on Fitch in his Madison office during the summer, 
that's probably what you'd have seen, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing he might pontificate about is vocabulary and language," 
Karavolas said. "He studies words. In seminars, he would correct students to be 
sure they were precise (in their language). Students used to be fearful of him. 
He'd really jump in on them; they had to be on guard, and sometimes they were 
intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
And while he now might be summoned to lecture anywhere in the world, Fitch 
said, there was a time when he wondered whether he would ever amount to 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"What I was worried about first was whether I would ever get a good idea," he 
said, reliving the memory of a calculus class where the teacher had given the 
students a puzzling task. Fitch approached the assignment with relish. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured it all out and realized there was a pattern I could construct (to 
solve the problem). I took it in to the teacher very excitedly, showed him what 
I had and said, 'I can figure out any of these things real easy now.' He 
allowed as how everything I said was correct but that Blaise Pascal had 
discovered this about 400 years ago. I probably should have been heartened that 
I had discovered something all by myself and that therefore perhaps I had a 
little gift, but I went out of there crushed. I said, 'I'm 400 years behind 
time; how will I ever catch up?' " 
</P>
<P>
As a scientist, of course, Fitch knew all about quantum leaps. By 1967, he had 
made his, publishing a paper while at Wisconsin that won him public attention. 
Until then, evolutionists had related organisms on the basis of appearance, 
such as their anatomy or physiology. But Fitch published one of the first 
papers that used molecular sequences of proteins to infer the relationships 
among such diverse organisms as plants, insects, fungi and vertebrates. 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of study that infuriates creationists but won plaudits among 
scientists because it shed more light on the historical time line that 
evolutionists believe connects all living things. 
</P>
<P>
In what he describes today as a relatively simple series of tests, Fitch had 
helped verify at the molecular level what biologists had spent hundreds of 
years doing by looking at physical characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Fitch) hasn't been a hands-on biologist, but he's sat back and tried to 
put the pieces into a larger puzzle," said UCI associate professor Richard 
Lenski, who said he has met Fitch on three occasions and who will be a 
colleague when Fitch reports to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the difficulties in molecular biology is that you're essentially 
dealing with trying to make inferences from historical data. So DNA and protein 
sequences give information about what organisms are closely related to one 
another, but it's difficult to simply sit down and look at it and make sense of 
it. . . . What Fitch brings to it is rather than focusing on a particular data 
set and dealing with that, he focuses on how one should even go about analyzing 
the type of data molecular biologists and evolutionary biologists are trying to 
get." 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly how Fitch sees himself. To use computer language, he is someone 
who knows, in effect, how to set up workable programs to make use of the 
available data. 
</P>
<P>
On a chalkboard in his office at USC, Fitch has drawn something that looks no 
more complex than an upside-down cactus -- with a trunk and various branches. 
But it serves as a working model for his study of changes in the human 
influenza virus over the last 50 years, the subject of a five-year research 
grant he has received from the National Science Foundation that he will 
continue at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
The tree represents a genealogy of the mutating virus, which Fitch put together 
after looking at genes from flu viruses that had been isolated in patients 
between 1933 and 1985. Fitch's methodology has shown how the virus has changed 
and how rapidly. "As soon as you are infected with the virus, your immune 
system says, 'Hey, there's a stranger here,' and starts to make stuff to fight 
it," Fitch said. "What this (his study) represents in our mind is that the 
virus is changing its coat so you can't recognize it. Of course, you can 
recognize it as being different, and then you'll make antibodies to the new 
coat." 
</P>
<P>
But that delay, caused by the flu virus's ability to mutate, can give it 
another few weeks to make life miserable. Part of what fascinated Fitch was 
that the genealogy of the flu virus didn't look like that of any other virus he 
had seen before. The influenza virus, rather than succumbing to the body's 
attacks to fight it off, tries instead to outrun it. 
</P>
<P>
Figuring out a way to plot that on paper is the kind of challenge that keeps 
him coming back to the office. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, this almost ceases to be a job," Fitch said. "For us, it is more 
play than most people's jobs because it's new. The reason jobs become jobs for 
other people is that they're doing repetitively what may well have been an 
exciting thing for them to have learned how to do, but once you've done it 
100,000 times, it just doesn't quite give you the same jolt it did the first 
time." 
</P>
<P>
While research is Fitch's forte, he will also teach undergraduates at UCI. 
"Just being around the kids is a good thing, but if you're going to do even 
half-good a job, you have to really spend some time on the material," he said. 
"If it's a field like molecular biology, it advances so quickly that it forces 
you to keep up. It's not like medieval history, where the history hasn't 
changed since last year. In this case, it changes and it's really necessary for 
your competitiveness in the field to stay abreast. The tendency when you focus 
on your research is to learn only about things that directly impinge 
immediately on your research." 
</P>
<P>
After a childhood divided between California and the East Coast, Fitch packed 
up his curiosity and went to UC Berkeley, where he majored in chemistry, became 
politicized and lived in an integrated rooming house that left him with, among 
other things, a lifelong appreciation for jazz. Then it was off to 
post-doctoral work at Stanford and University College in London before 
beginning his professional academic life at Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
During the Vietnam War, the University of Wisconsin got a reputation for having 
one of the more strident anti-war student bodies. The tensions crested when a 
graduate student was killed by a bomb planted in a research lab by a radical 
protester. 
</P>
<P>
Fitch, who had liberal political leanings but not to the point of activism on 
campus, said the experience affected everyone on the Madison campus. "The 
Vietnam opposition voiced by the student (who planted the bomb) was 
characterized by escalating rhetoric. Nobody really thought to ask the question 
what if deeds matched the rhetoric," Fitch said. "Suddenly, everyone was 
terribly horrified by the fact somebody died, and it was the natural 
consequence of believing one's own rhetoric because it had gotten totally out 
of hand. And suddenly a pall came over the campus and that really ended the 
student (protest). . . . It just so shattered everybody. They suddenly realized 
it had these consequences. . . . It's not that the campus did a flip-flop, but 
it dampened the fires." 
</P>
<P>
Fitch's liberal politics took a more conventional route. He has served on both 
local and regional planning commissions, first while a post-doctoral student at 
Stanford and later in Madison. He also was a ward organizer for the county 
Democratic Party in Madison. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues in Madison said he developed a reputation as someone who could work 
with opposing factions. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time he gets riled up," said former colleague Karavolas, "is if 
someone doesn't want to listen to reason and work out a position. He'll get 
frustrated when he can't employ Socratic means to try to convey an idea to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
But then, Karavolas recalled, someone would say, "Walter, you're getting far 
too serious. Calm down," and Fitch would laugh at himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Walter is a great guy. I miss him," Karavolas said. "I miss his personality, 
his easy wit. Many times when things would get sticky, he had a way of cracking 
people up and getting us all to see things in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Which is what Fitch's life's work is really about. 
</P>
<P>
His evolution as a scientist is, in some ways, quite clear and direct. The 
encyclopedia he read as a child begat a microscope ("I put everything under 
it"), and the microscope begat a chemistry set ("I mixed everything in it"). 
</P>
<P>
The chain remains unbroken today. "There's always information out there we 
don't know," he said. "And if you ask the right questions, you can suddenly 
comprehend a large fraction of information. What you're out there to do is 
solve puzzles."

To say you're from Orange County will make you unique in the state of 
California, but not in the United States. For there are seven other Orange 
Counties in the nation. Travel to Florida, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, 
Texas, Vermont or Virginia, and you'll find an Orange County. But don't expect 
to feel like you're at home. 
</P>
<P>
We are one of three counties to have a city named Orange. But in the other two 
places, Texas and Virginia, the city is also the county seat. (Florida does 
have an Orange City and Orange Park, neither one of which is in Orange County; 
New York's Orange Lake is in Orange County but Orangeburg is not.) 
</P>
<P>
The counties range in area from Florida's more than 900 square miles to 
Virginia's 342. But in terms of population, our 2.2 million is four times the 
size of Florida's OC (about 600,000 people, second largest) and dwarfs the 
smallest (Indiana's 19,000). 
</P>
<P>
While it may come as a surprise to some, we are considerably more ethnically 
diverse than the other Oranges and will continue to be so as the '90s progress. 
It is perhaps no surprise that we wield a good deal more economic power than 
other Orange Counties. 
</P>
<P>
The charts on the rest of this page detail how we have differed from the others 
in the past, how we do now, and, in some cases, how we will in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ann Marie Sullivan, principal of La Monte Academie in Laguna Niguel, is 
chatting with a student in her office. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation is animated, warm. Sullivan asks for a description of the 
formal gown the girl wore to a recent senior prom. "Will we be able to see the 
pictures?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
Neither acknowledges the fact that Sullivan won't ever be able to see the 
photographs. She has been blind since birth. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, 47, has been principal of La Monte -- a small, private school for 
gifted and learning-disabled children in kindergarten through 12th grade -- for 
two years. She's also working toward a doctorate in clinical psychology through 
the Santa Barbara-based Fielding Institute, and she's the mother of a 
2-year-old child she's raising on her own. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan doesn't seem to think that her blindness is any big deal. "In order to 
be a well-functioning person I need to acknowledge I'm blind, but I don't feel 
different from anybody else," she says. "I describe myself as a blind person 
without an excuse: I don't use being blind as a reason for not being a whole 
person." 
</P>
<P>
In her interactions with the La Monte staff, Sullivan seems energetic and 
even-tempered, quick with a quip or a compliment. "Ann has made me feel good 
about myself, going to work after 40 years," said Genevieve Jamison (Jammie) 
Tiberi, an instructional aide who helps Sullivan organize students' records. 
"She's fun to work with," Tiberi said. "She's not only my boss, but she's 
become a close friend." 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago Sister Paula Jane Tupa, the school's founder and director, heard 
about Sullivan, who has a master's degree in psychology but was eking out a 
living in Long Beach doing office work and phone sales. Tupa called her up. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the phone I could tell right away this was someone I needed," Tupa said. 
"I didn't even know she was blind." A friend drove Sullivan to Laguna Niguel 
for the job interview, which lasted only a few minutes. Tupa said she had no 
hesitation about hiring a secretary who couldn't see: "She has so much else to 
offer -- and she doesn't feel sorry for herself." 
</P>
<P>
After two years, Tupa promoted Sullivan from secretary to principal. "This is 
the first year she's (completely) on her own, and there's no problem," Tupa 
said. "This frees me up to spend my energies on where the corporation needs to 
go. Because she's a trained psychologist, she can do for the kids what I can't. 
A lot of times there are lines around the corner of kids waiting just to talk 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I think because she's blind, there are some inner workings there the rest of 
us are not gifted with," Tupa said. "It's incredible, it's almost weird, how 
she understands people. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are often afraid of people who are not sighted. Once they get to know 
her, there's no problem. She knows you by your walk. Once a student tried to 
sneak in late, through the front, and she said 'John!' He stopped in his 
tracks, he was so astonished she could know he was there." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan is tall, very thin, with dark brown hair. She smiles a lot. She has 
dark blue eyes, which, she says, are just "a shell" covering her eye sockets. 
She's been blind since birth; her natural eyes were removed long ago to prevent 
glaucoma. 
</P>
<P>
In May she acquired new hand-painted plastic eyes, made possible by donations 
from the Laguna Niguel and Mission Viejo Lions clubs. Sullivan was introduced 
to those groups by Marla Gitterman, a Laguna Niguel resident who has organized 
15 volunteers to make tape recordings of Sullivan's psychology textbooks, which 
aren't available in Braille. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan lives with Mary Therese (Thesie) Kissel, a longtime, legally blind 
friend trained in carpentry and electrical and plumbing repair. Kissel, who is 
presently out of work, assists Sullivan with some day-to-day tasks. But 
Sullivan is determined not to be dependent on other people. "I live in a visual 
society, but I do not want to live in a blind world," she said. "Vision means 
more than just seeing." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan uses a cane when navigating new territory, but not at home or on the 
job. "When I don't need a symbol of being blind, I can put it away," she said. 
"If I had a (guide) dog, the symbol would always be with me." She gets to and 
from work by Dial-A-Ride bus, and her daughter, Heather, attends a preschool 
near La Monte. 
</P>
<P>
At home, Sullivan spends as much time as she can with Heather, a curly-haired, 
playful bundle of energy. Heather is sighted. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever her daughter came near her during a recent conversation, Sullivan lit 
up. Heather cuddled up to her mom, giving her children's books to read aloud, 
sometimes guiding Sullivan's fingers over the Braille inscriptions she has 
added to several books. 
</P>
<P>
Many people have made false assumptions about her ability to take care of 
Heather, Sullivan said. "When I brought her home, the doctor made me sign a 
paper saying I would have a visiting nurse come and see her. The visiting nurse 
never showed up. It's a good thing I didn't need her!" Sullivan laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"When she was a little baby, people walked up to me and said, 'You don't 
deserve to have a child,' " Sullivan said. Such incidents don't happen anymore. 
She added: "I think people see she looks so healthy, so free, and they think, 
'Oh, it's fine.' " 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Sullivan said, some comments still bother her. Once she took Heather to a 
medical clinic to be treated for an ear infection, and a woman said to the 
child: "Someday, little one, you're gonna be momma's eyes," Sullivan recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"My thought about that was, someday that kind of talk is going to make Heather 
so angry, because we don't live like that. I don't feel someday Heather's going 
to be my eyes," Sullivan said. "I have vision. It's just that I can't see." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan was born on Staten Island, N.Y., one of nine children. Her blindness 
resulted from her premature birth. She describes her childhood as "pretty 
average. I did all the things my brothers and sisters did. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved the New York subways. I saw almost everything the city could offer 
me," she said. "I had such good friends. I was probably the only blind student 
at the Catholic high school I attended." 
</P>
<P>
After two years of college, at age 20, she entered a Benedictine convent in 
Philadelphia. She was a Benedictine nun for 15 years, five of them as mother 
superior of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Kissel entered the convent eight years before Sullivan left. Both women 
departed in 1978 because the overall Benedictine administration had become 
conservative and was discouraging nuns from being socially active outside their 
community, Sullivan said. While making her decision to leave, "strangely 
enough, I was reading 'Zorba the Greek,' " she recalled. "I thought, there's 
just too much of the Zorba in me, too much of the dance. I had to move on." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan briefly joined another order, then enrolled at Villa Maria College in 
Erie, Pa. She graduated summa cum laude, then earned a master's degree in 
psychology from the Illinois School of Professional Psychology in Chicago. The 
blustery Midwest winters made her decide, five years ago, to come to 
California. (Kissel, with whom she'd stayed in touch after leaving the convent, 
came to California separately.) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, her romance with Robert Sullivan, whom she'd met in Chicago, was 
rocky. Robert, who is legally blind, visited her in California, but they 
canceled their wedding plans. Then Robert went back to Illinois, and Ann Marie 
discovered she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out I was pregnant, my first reaction was, 'Don't tell him,' " 
Sullivan said. She did, however, and Robert returned to California. "He seemed 
so settled, and he seemed like the Robert I knew, that I fell in love with," 
she said. The two were married, and Robert began attending a Claremont 
seminary. The marriage lasted only one year. 
</P>
<P>
"He went back to Chicago. He just couldn't cope out here," Sullivan said. 
"Robert wanted Heather with all his heart, but he just couldn't deal with being 
a husband and father." 
</P>
<P>
But Sullivan was delighted to become a mother. "I love kids, I think I would be 
classified as a kid person," she said. "I had Heather when I was 44. And that 
was so neat, that was very special for me. I felt like God was saying to me, 
'The years you gave to me weren't lost,' " Sullivan says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sullivan admits, raising Heather alone is difficult. She likes the work 
at La Monte, but her salary is small. Covering living expenses and paying 
tuition for graduate school stretch her finances very thin. She receives a 
small amount of federal assistance for Heather through Robert's social security 
income, but she's saving that money for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
So Sullivan and Kissel have started a mail-order business. Once Sullivan earns 
her doctoral degree, four or five years from now, she hopes to establish a 
private counseling practice. She doesn't think her blindness will affect her 
ability to be a good therapist. 
</P>
<P>
On several occasions, however, being unable to see has made Sullivan vulnerable 
to attack. In her adult life she's been assaulted three times, she said, but 
she managed to escape her attackers. 
</P>
<P>
"People see you out on the street with a cane, and think you're more 
vulnerable," Sullivan said. Yet, "I think it wouldn't be good for me to take 
the attitude I should not trust people. I think you just say, well, those kinds 
of things happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made a basic choice in my life to be happy. It's not like that's 
ready-made and you ever know how to do it, but that's my strong inner goal. I 
take responsibility for my own inner happiness. I don't sit down and say, 'Poor 
me.' I say, 'What can I do to make the situation better?' "

BUSH CALLS FOR MARS TRIP, MOON BASE IN 21ST CENTURY; 
</P>

NASA AND QUAYLE TO SET TIME

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, marking the 20th anniversary of man's first lunar landing, 
proposed today that the United States establish a base on the moon in the 21st 
Century to be followed by a manned mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Bush offered no price tag for the costly program he promised would lead "back 
to the moon, back to the future, and this time back to stay." 
</P>
<P>
"Then a journey into tomorrow," he said. "A journey to another planet, a manned 
mission to Mars." The distance between Mars and Earth varies from 48.7 million 
miles and 248 million miles. 
</P>
<P>
Bush offered few details beyond his broad goals, and said he was leaving it to 
Vice President Dan Quayle, the National Space Council and NASA to come up with 
"realistic timetables." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Deadline for Mars Trip 
</P>
<P>
Adm. Richard Truly, administrator of NASA, said the President has asked that 
the lunar station be established in the first decade of the next century. He 
said no deadline has been set for the Mars mission. 
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony from the steps of the National Air and Space Museum, the 
President reasserted the goal of establishing Space Station Freedom in the 
1990s, the necessary first step for the moon and Mars projects. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was flanked on the outdoor museum stage by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, 
the two men who planted their footsteps on the moon on July 20, 1969, and 
Michael Collins, the third member of the Apollo 11 crew. 
</P>
<P>
"America should never stop seeking distant frontiers," Bush said. "We dream of 
distant shores we've not yet seen. . . . A dream to be realized by future 
generations must begin with this generation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have rested on our Apollo laurels long enough. It's time to get moving 
again," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush drew Democratic support for his vision, but the decision to provide no 
budget or deadline prompted criticism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One Small Step' 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dennis E. Eckart (D-Ohio) said Bush was "calling for one great leap for 
mankind" but not even providing the money for "one small step," using a 
take-off of Armstrong's first words from the lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
"The party of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson applauds the decision of 
President Bush to recommit America to space exploration," said Rep. Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.), the House majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
"But the real test of presidential leadership is not whether he can marshal the 
words but the resources to restore America's preeminence in space," Gephardt 
said. "In sum, Mr. President, there's no such thing as a free launch." 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt said that under Democratic presidents of the '60s, the NASA budget 
approached 4% of the U.S. budget. Republican Presidents of the '80s have 
proposed less than 1%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$30-Billion Start-Up Cost 
</P>
<P>
Truly, in a press briefing at the White House, noted that Congress is already 
balking at the start-up costs for the $30-billion space station. The station is 
the essential for the moon project and the trip to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an irony that at the time we find this sort of leadership and vision for 
America's future, that at the same time, this very day up on the Hill, we are 
in fact fighting very hard for the very life of Space Station Freedom and other 
things in the civil space program," he said.

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and hawkish rival Ariel Sharon clashed angrily in 
a closed-door meeting Wednesday night over talks with Palestinians on an 
Israeli plan for elections in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Political sources said Trade Minister Sharon, who insists there must be no 
balloting before an end to the uprising, attacked Shamir in front of Likud 
Party ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers, briefed by ministers close to Shamir, published 
near-identical accounts of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by Sharon why he had not been informed of the talks with local Arabs, 
which Sharon views as harmful to Israel's security, Shamir was quoted as 
saying: 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in this room hears secrets from me, and they do not leak them. You 
leak everything. It's impossible to tell you anything." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon retorted: "I am not prepared and not able to compete with you in 
vulgarity. I have only contempt for your behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir: "You create an ugly atmosphere and hatred among us." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon: "I can only laugh at your statements." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir: "We'll see who laughs last." 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers quoted ministers close to Shamir as saying the premier may be forced 
to fire Sharon if he does not stop such attacks. 
</P>
<P>
As defense minister, Sharon led Israel's costly 1982 invasion of Lebanon to 
evict PLO guerrillas. He was forced to resign in 1983 for indirect 
responsibility in a massacre by Lebanese Christians of Palestinian civilians in 
refugee camps in an Israeli-controlled area of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian lawyers today announced a one-month boycott of Israeli 
military courts in the occupied West Bank, accusing Israel of violating basic 
legal principles. 
</P>
<P>
Bahig Tamimi, head of the Arab Lawyers Assn., said the 250 lawyers in his 
organization will refuse to appear before the military courts until Aug. 20.

HOUSE DEFENSE LEADER SAYS HE'LL TRY TO FORCE CHENEY TO CUT COST OF B-2 PROGRAM

A congressional defense leader split with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today 
and announced that he will try to force Cheney to lower the $70-billion cost of 
the radar-evading B-2 stealth bomber program. 
</P>
<P>
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.), ending his 
unconditional support of Cheney's weapons budget, announced that he plans to 
offer an amendment next week that would require Cheney to trim the cost of the 
B-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to kill it," Aspin told reporters. "I just want to slow it down 
and take another look at the figures. 
</P>
<P>
"The argument is (over) how many B-2s do you need," Aspin said. "I think there 
is a consensus (in Congress) that you need a penetrating bomber." 
</P>
<P>
The black bomber, built with non-metallic material and a sleek shape to evade 
Soviet radar in a nuclear war, made its first test flight Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But Aspin told Cheney at a hearing last week that there is "no chance, no 
chance" that Congress will approve the up to $8 billion a year Cheney expects 
to request for the plane in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Planes Instead of 3 
</P>
<P>
Aspin said his amendment to the annual defense authorization bill in the full 
House next week would allow the government to build two of the planes next year 
instead of the three Cheney wants and to buy parts to build two more the next 
year rather than five. 
</P>
<P>
He said the amendment would authorize $4.2 billion of Cheney's $4.7-billion B-2 
request for next year but would prohibit any production money's being spent 
until Cheney submits and Congress approves a revised B-2 program to cut the 
$70-billion cost. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin said that would mean building fewer than the 132 B-2 bombers the Air 
Force plans but he said he had no suggestions on how big a cut should be made 
or how it should be achieved.

A former civilian worker for the Army was convicted today of conspiring with a 
U.S. soldier to sell American military secrets to East German and Soviet 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
The federal jury took seven hours over two days to find Huseyin Yildirim of 
Bellear Beach, Fla., guilty of serving as a courier for convicted spy and 
former Warrant Officer James W. Hall II. 
</P>
<P>
Yildirim, a Turkish-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, was charged with conspiring 
with Hall to sell classified information to Eastern Bloc agents between 1983 
and 1988 when Hall was stationed in Germany and New Jersey. Yildirim was 
working as a civilian mechanic at an Army auto shop in Germany at the time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stationed at Nearby Fort 
</P>
<P>
The trial was held in Savannah because Hall was stationed at nearby Ft. Stewart 
at the time of his arrest in December. 
</P>
<P>
Hall pleaded guilty at a court-martial in March and was sentenced to 40 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Yildirim, 61, faces a maximum life term in prison. U.S. District Judge B. Avant 
Edenfield said he will sentence Yildirim within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Lamar Walter called no witnesses to rebut the 32 witnesses for 
the prosecution or the more than 100 pieces of evidence used to link Yildirim 
to Hall's espionage activities. 
</P>
<P>
Walter said he will appeal the verdict on the grounds that a videotape showing 
Hall discussing his espionage activities with an FBI agent posing as a Soviet 
diplomat should not have been admitted as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour videotape, Hall identifies Yildirim as his go-between with 
the East German government. 
</P>
<P>
Defense experts said the espionage scheme damaged U.S. intelligence efforts in 
Europe. Hall worked as an analyst of intercepted radio and telephone traffic 
and coded messages.

About 2,000 plywood workers at five Georgia-Pacific plants in Arkansas and 
Mississippi went on strike this morning after the breakdown of contract talks 
about overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
The walkout forced the temporary shutdown of the mills. A Georgia-Pacific 
spokesman said the strike involves about 1,000 union workers at mills in 
Crossett and Fordyce in Arkansas, and a roughly equal number of workers at 
mills in Louisville, Taylorsville and Gloster, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said the company's latest offer called for a four-year 
contract, with pay increases of 2% the first, second and fourth years of the 
pact and 3% the third year. The unions wanted a three-year contract with pay 
increases of 3% each year. 
</P>
<P>
But the union's main concern was over the company's proposal to pay workers 
regular wages for working on Sunday and dropping time and-a-half wages paid 
under the old contract. The company offered Sunday workers a one-time bonus of 
$800 to $1,000.

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., the nation's largest telecommunications 
company, said today its profit in the second quarter rose 18% to $694 million. 
</P>
<P>
On a per share basis, the earnings increased to 66 cents a share from 55 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The communications giant said its revenues rose 5.2% to $9.26 billion from 
$8.80 billion a year ago. Expense controls allowed earnings to rise even faster 
than the revenues, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said AT&amp;T's earnings were expected to rise due to strong demand 
for its long-distance telephone services. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of the year the company had a net profit of $1.29 billion, 
compared with $1.09 billion a year ago. Revenues rose to $17.91 billion from 
$17.19 billion.

SENATE OKS GOVERNMENT NUCLEAR FUEL CORPORATION

<P>
The Senate today approved legislation to convert the Energy Department's 
nuclear fuel operations to a government corporation, a move environmentalists 
said would amount to a $9-billion bailout for nuclear utilities. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 73 to 26. A similar House bill has not moved out of committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill, strongly supported by the Bush Administration, would create an 
independent federal corporation to run uranium enrichment plants at Portsmouth, 
Ohio, and Paducah, Ky. A plant at Oak Ridge, Tenn., has been inactive since 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed corporation would be independent of the federal bureaucracy and 
could make financing and operating decisions without prior approval from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration says this conversion would make the uranium enrichment 
operation more sound and capable of competing against foreign suppliers of 
enrichment services -- including the Soviet Union, which now supplies some U.S. 
nuclear utilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department facilities are the only domestic suppliers of enriched 
uranium, which is the fuel used in nuclear reactors. The department's plants 
increase, or "enrich," uranium-235 atoms beyond their natural concentration. 
</P>
<P>
The plants also enrich uranium for use in government reactors that make 
materials for nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
The American Nuclear Energy Council, representing utilities and others with 
interests in the nuclear industry, applauded the Senate vote and said it hopes 
that the House will move quickly to pass its own version. 
</P>
<P>
"Electricity consumers will benefit because competitively priced enrichment 
services will keep nuclear fuel costs low," Edward M. Davis, president of the 
nuclear group, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and some other citizen groups have criticized the Senate bill 
as an unjustified bailout of the commercial nuclear industry. They contend that 
since the utilities benefit from operation of plants built with taxpayers' 
money, the industry should be held responsible for the debt incurred by the 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department says the industry should not be held accountable because 
the plants' operations benefit the whole country. It also says there is $3 
billion in outstanding debt, not the $9 billion claimed by Public Citizen, a 
Ralph Nader organization that had pressed for defeat of the Senate legislation.

Japanese auto maker Nissan Motor Co. said today it plans to nearly double the 
production capacity of its automobile assembly plant in Smyrna, Tenn., in 1992 
when a middle passenger car model will be added to its production line. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's No. 2 auto maker said the expansion program will add about 2,000 more 
jobs to its present work force of 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo-based company said the Smyrna plant of Nissan Motor Manufacturing 
Corp. U.S.A. currently produces 240,000 Sentra passenger cars and trucks a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The production capacity will be expanded to 440,000 units when a third model 
will be assembled there in 1992, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cumulative production of vehicles at the plant topped 1 million 
units, making the facility Nissan's second overseas project to attain the 
milestone. Nissan Mexicana, S.A., was the first to set the milestone in April, 
the company said.

Pete Rose says he is not afraid to meet baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti. He 
just does not want to do it on the Hall of Fame weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's Cincinnati Reds are scheduled to play the Boston Red Sox in the annual 
Hall of Fame exhibition game Monday, but he will not be going. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds' manager said that he had been looking forward to attending the 
festivities but that he does not want the publicity over his court fight with 
Giamatti to overshadow the induction ceremonies of former teammate Johnny Bench 
and Carl Yastrzemski. Rose noted that there was a chance he would meet 
Giamatti, who will be at the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just unfortunate," Rose said, in announcing his decision late Wednesday 
night. "It's just something that I had to do. I can understand their feelings. 
I just don't want to distract from anything. I've been around this (media) 
circus for about four months now, and there's just no sense in taking the 
circus to Cooperstown." 
</P>
<P>
Rose said, however, that he was not backing away from a possible encounter with 
Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not scared to face anybody," Rose said. "I just want you to know that. I'm 
not scared to look in the commissioner's eye or anything like that. He has to 
be there. I don't." 
</P>
<P>
Rose asked and received permission from team owner Marge Schott to stay behind 
when the Reds go to Cooperstown. Rose said it was only fair to the inductees. 
</P>
<P>
"Their careers have been great. I don't want to distract from anything like 
that," Rose said. "I know this would be the first time that Commissioner 
Giamatti and myself would be in the same area that people know about, and I 
didn't even want to take the chance that the circus would continue.

Hurdler Greg Foster and sprinter Leroy Burrell, two of the biggest attractions 
for Saturday's New York Track and Field Games, have withdrawn, the meet's 
executive director, Fred Lebow, said. 
</P>
<P>
Lebow announced today that Burrell, who was timed in 9.94 seconds for 100 
meters this year, the fourth-fastest clocking ever, has an injured left leg. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had received a message from Foster's club, World Class Athletes, 
saying only that the two-time world champion and 1984 Olympic silver medalist 
in the 110-meter high hurdles, would not compete. There was no further 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell and Foster joined a growing list of key athletes who have withdrawn 
from the first major international outdoor meet in New York in 23 years. Others 
included women's milers Mary Slaney, Lynn Williams of Canada and PattiSue 
Plumer, men's high hurdler Arthur Blake and pole vaulter Billy Olson.

Owners of the 16 teams in the Continental Basketball Assn. decided today to

Commissioner Jay Ramsdel, 25, and his deputy commissioner, Jerry Schemmel, were

DC-10 that crashed Wednesday in Iowa. Schemmel was listed as one of the 
survivors, but Ramsdel was still missing as of this afternoon. 
</P>

"The crash will have no effect on the operations of the draft," said Tim Sise,

SIOUX CITY HAD ITS EMERGENCY RESCUE TEAMS AT READY 
</P>

<P>
Assistant Chief Orville Thiele, a husky, red-haired 25-year veteran of the 
Sioux City, Iowa, fire department, was at the console at 3:40 p.m. Wednesday 
when the Woodbury County communications center radioed that a crippled DC-10 
airliner was about to crash land. 
</P>
<P>
Thiele was stunned, but not unprepared. The area's surprisingly 
well-coordinated fire-and-rescue operations had confronted almost precisely 
such a problem in an exercise in 1987, and -- by lucky coincidence -- the 
emergency services had drilled again just two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all pretty well prepared," said Patti Bauerly, Thiele's administrative 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loses Hydraulic Pressure 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, they needed everything they could muster. Two minutes later, 
the communications center radioed again, this time to report that the airliner 
had lost hydraulic pressure, which meant that the pilot could not use the 
ailerons, landing flaps and brakes to control the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"All he could do was turn right," Bauerly said. "And hope." 
</P>
<P>
Robert White, a Sioux City police official, mused that ordinarily such crashes 
come without warning. The plane catches fire, or is thrown askew by a wind 
shear and bolts to the ground instantly. By the time the fire-and-rescue crews 
arrive, precious time has been lost. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, authorities had about 45 minutes' notice from the pilot before 
Flight 232 erupted in a ball of fire, flipped over on its back and crumbled 
into three huge chunks in a field a half-mile short of the huge 9,000-foot 
runway at Sioux Gateway airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We had time to coordinate, get a command center set up, start blocking off 
traffic," White said. White, Bauerly and almost everyone else who could get to 
a telephone began calling in off-duty fire and police personnel. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the DC-10 reached the Sioux City area, officials had assembled an 
array of some 35 fire engines, ambulances, rescue units and police cars, some 
of them from as far as 30 miles away. Some 200 police and rescue workers 
eventually gathered on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Richard Sorenson, a pilot with the Iowa Air National Guard, had just 
landed his own A-7 single-seat jet fighter and was taxiing toward the hangar 
when he got a warning from the airport control tower to clear the runway for 
the crippled Flight 232. 
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion was coming across that he was having severe controllability 
problems, that he could turn in only one direction and that he was not sure he 
could make the runway," Sorenson said at a late evening press conference. 
</P>
<P>
The airliner came in from the east and -- obviously with severe difficulty -- 
maneuvered into position to use the southwest runway, which usually remains 
unused. (Sioux Gateway was a base for B-29 Stratofortresses during World War 
II. It has the longest runway in the area.) 
</P>
<P>
In Sorenson's words: "Shortly before touchdown, about the time an airplane 
would begin to flare, the right wing began to dip and roll, and the nose began 
to fall, to a position of 15 to 25 degrees. It was very apparent at that moment 
he could not make a safe landing. 
</P>
<P>
"The only real question was how disastrous the impact would be. . . . There was 
a huge fireball, black smoke. . . . The plane began disintegrating, huge pieces 
began cartwheeling from the airplane. . . . There were a lot of things falling 
off the plane. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Rescue units sped quickly into the field to carry away survivors who were 
walking away from the burning wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department officials said it took 20 minutes to put out the blaze from the 
burning jet fuel and airliner. White said they were still searching for bodies 
Wednesday night when the sun went down and left only the glowing embers. 
</P>
<P>
"They're starting to walk the fields," White reported sadly. 
</P>
<P>
"We were as prepared as we could be," he said.
