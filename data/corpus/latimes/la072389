Brent Spiner deserves praise for his portrayal of Lt. Data on "Star Trek: The 
Next Generation." I'm sure it's not easy bringing an android character "to 
life," but Spiner does it with skill and sensitivity, making Data one of the 
more enjoyable characters on the show. I hope his work is recognized when the 
nominations go out for Emmys.

Shame on Channel 5 for running horribly "colorized" versions of classic films 
marred by Turner Program Services. I tried watching "The Big Sleep" and it 
looked ludicrous, a true desecration of a piece of art. Black and white was 
absolutely essential to the mood. Do the Spanish slop colored paint on 
Picasso's "Guernica"? 
</P>
<P>
I turned down the color on my set, but found it too bright and in need of 
contrast adjusting. It still didn't look right. I've refused to watch 
colorization before, but I really wanted to see this movie. 
</P>
<P>
As for the advertisers, I saw their commercials in black and white. Their 
impact was greatly diminished. I would have seen them as you'd intended if KTLA 
had shown the film as its artists had intended. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Television Times for printing no checks in front of the film's title 
and noting (color) after it. I'll certainly avoid them in the future.

WHAT ROMANTIC CAN RESIST CUTE STORIES THAT UNFOLD AS BOY MEETS GIRL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE "CUTE MEET" has been a staple of the movies for decades. Even today, when 
plots are more frenzied and sophisticated, there is rarely a romantic comedy 
that doesn't have one. 
</P>
<P>
This venerable device is simple. Jimmy Stewart climbs aboard a crowded bus in 
New York on a rainy day. He is crushed against a stranger, Claudette Colbert. 
He opens his raincoat and the zipper catches in Claudette's sweater. 
Embarrassment. Laughter. They have to get off the bus together. Bingo. Love. 
Marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Cute meets happen in real life, too. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Donohue writes about what she suspects was a cute meet on the Costa 
del Sol in Spain. It had all the elements, she says, but she doesn't know how 
it turned out. That's the trouble with cute meets in real life. You may see 
them happen, but you never know how they turn out. 
</P>
<P>
Donohue recalls the story like this: 
</P>
<P>
She was sitting on the seaside deck of a hotel facing the Mediterranean at 
about sunset. A young man walking in from the beach waved up to someone. 
Donohue assumed it was an acquaintance. Then the young man shouted, "Are you 
stuck?" 
</P>
<P>
"Looking around and up," she recalls, "I saw a young woman on a balcony. She 
was wearing a robe. She was unable to open the door behind her and was trapped 
on the balcony." 
</P>
<P>
The young woman asked the young man to go into the bar and call a "Mrs. Ray" or 
something like that. A few minutes later, the young man came out and shouted 
that there was no such person in the hotel. He asked the young woman for her 
room number so he could get help to her. 
</P>
<P>
"As I left the patio," Donohue recalls, "I saw him and a hotel staffer waiting 
for the elevator. I have no idea how this evolved, of course, but they were 
both young Americans, strangers to each other, meeting on the romantic Costa 
del Sol -- he the hero saving a damsel in distress." 
</P>
<P>
Donohue, of course, has the right to make up her own ending. Since it was not a 
movie, she will never know. But if, like me, she's a romantic, she will be 
spinning her own scenario. 
</P>
<P>
I can imagine two possible endings. The young man goes up to the young woman's 
room with a bellman. The bellman opens the door. The two of them go in. The 
bellman opens the door to the balcony. The woman walks in, tightening her robe 
about her. "It's about time," she says uncivilly. 
</P>
<P>
The young man explains that he acted as quickly as he could. Unappeased, the 
young woman says, "Thank you. But if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone. I 
have to dress. I have a date with my fiance." 
</P>
<P>
That's one way. But we don't want it to end that way, do we? 
</P>
<P>
The way I see it, the man enters the room with the bellman and frees the woman 
from the balcony. "This is embarrassing," she says. "I haven't got on anything 
under this robe." 
</P>
<P>
The bellman beats a discreet retreat. The man, who is still in his beach 
clothes, says, "While you're getting into something decent, I'll go change." 
</P>
<P>
The woman laughs provocatively and says, "Should I dress for dinner?" 
</P>
<P>
"Cocktails first," the man says, "and then maybe a stroll on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you from?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Akron, Ohio." 
</P>
<P>
Dismayed, "Not really!" 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so bad in the spring." 
</P>
<P>
"Well," she says, "you have been awfully nice." 
</P>
<P>
She finds something ravishing to wear, and they meet for cocktails. It turns 
out that he is chief executive officer of a rubber corporation with 
headquarters in Akron, but he has a private jet, homes in Malibu and Monaco and 
an apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that she is a jewel thief. That's what she was doing out on the 
balcony, trying to gain access to another room through its balcony. She wisely 
decides not to tell the young man this. He is obviously taken with her. She 
sees this as a chance to live the good life without working for it. 
</P>
<P>
They get married and have five children. They live in Akron, but they travel a 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't that nice?

OUTTAKES: THE PURR-FECT VOICE

<TEXT>
<P>
When MGM-UA's "Pink Panther" series debuts next year on CBS -- mixing animation 
and live action -- don't expect the quality of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." 
MGM-UA TV chief David Gerber tells us the animation will be several cuts above 
typical Saturday morning fare, "but I don't think any TV show could emulate the 
technique of 'Roger Rabbit' . . . without going bankrupt. We're going to 
concentrate on the character." 
</P>
<P>
The series had been in the planning stages for nearly two years, without a 
green light. Then "Roger Rabbit" hit the big screen, said co-producer George 
Schenck, and its blockbuster success "helped make this possible. Before, no one 
thought it could be done." 
</P>
<P>
The comic series about a feline that helps out a young reporter (Charlie 
Schlatter) could be a late-season replacement. 
</P>
<P>
But first, Gerber said, the producers must find a vocal talent who can provide 
a sound for the clever cat. After hundreds of taped auditions, they're still 
waiting to hear "the voice with the right texture." Stacy Jenel Smith

OUTTAKES: HUMAN RIGHTS HEROES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pat H. Broeske 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The whole world watched the drama that unfolded during the student-led 
pro-democracy demonstrations and ensuing massacre in Beijing's Tian An Men 
Square. Will it watch again -- through Hollywood's eyes? A number of producers 
hope so. 
</P>
<P>
So does HBO -- an insider there tells us the cable network is hungry for a 
China project, if the right one comes along. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Manheim (TV's "Roe vs. Wade"), who's pursuing dramatic rights, said 
he's "in direct touch with the dissident student leaders in China -- and 
elsewhere." Meaning Paris, where eight student leaders triumphantly surfaced on 
Bastille Day. 
</P>
<P>
The project will be part of "The Human Rights Project" -- a series of 
features/TV projects about "human rights heroes around the world." Manheim's 
company is partnered in the venture -- "in the works long before China 
transpired" -- with RAI, Italy's premiere TV network, and producer Alex Ponti, 
with the support of several human rights organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Other contenders include David Rintels, who's "kicking some ideas around with 
some people." And Mike Farrell, who'd like to find "an American hook. There are 
Americans who were there and involved. We'd like to make an agreement with the 
right individual." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, author and China expert Orville Schelle is trying to raise $800,000 
for a 90-minute documentary on the China uprising that would use existing 
footage from China and other locales. China's Chen Kaige ("Yellow Earth," "King 
of the Children"), in the United States when the protests exploded, would 
direct. Peter Kovler ("Hotel Terminus") will produce. 
</P>
<P>
Schelle said he is also being pursued as a consultant on several projects being 
developed by others. 
</P>
<P>
"The subject has universal appeal," Schelle surmised. "If you can believe in 
L.A. detective heroes, you can believe in human rights heroes. They really put 
their lives on the line." Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: BLOODY PG-13

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lots of critics took shots at the latest James Bond pic, "Licence to Kill," for 
its violence. We counted some 22 visibly dead on screen, some in pretty 
gruesome fashion. 
</P>
<P>
There's death by electric eel, shark -- and hungry maggots. One bad guy is 
decompressurized. Another is sent via conveyor belt to some sharp-edged 
machinery. There's an impaling and an incineration, along with your more 
traditional shootings, stranglings and falls from planes. 
</P>
<P>
So how did all this manage a PG-13? 
</P>
<P>
Richard Heffner, chairman of the MPAA ratings board, would only respond: "The 
rating reflects the majority opinion of the board. . . . Our decisions aren't 
made by doing a body count." 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Heffner revealed, it's been an "established tradition" for United 
Artists to fly several MPAA board members first class to London to view and 
rate the Bond films. But this year, they saw "Licence to Kill" here.

CHAMPAGNE STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE MONK Dom Perignon took one sip and exclaimed, "I'm drinking stars!" In 
return, a champagne was named after him. But there are people -- lots of them 
-- who worry about seeing stars every time a bottle of bubbly gets opened. 
These are the people who rush out of the room whenever a bottle of champagne 
makes an appearance, the same people who insist on pulling out those stories 
about others who've lost eyes to projectile champagne corks. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody need ever run out on a bottle of champagne again. The Hallen Co. in 
Houston, Texas, has now come up with a foolproof way to safely open a bottle of 
champagne. (This is the same company that makes the Screwpull Corkscrew, the 
world's best corkscrew wine opener. The Teflon-coated corkscrew is impossible 
to put in crooked, and the mechanism is engineered so that in one smooth turn 
the cork is removed -- all in one piece.) 
</P>
<P>
The Champagne Star is a small, heavy piece of sculpture that works on a simple 
principle. Once you've removed the wire cage that holds the cork onto a bottle 
of champagne, you put the Champagne Star in the four ridges left in the cork 
and press into place. You now have something that allows you to grasp the cork 
firmly. Hold on, turn slowly, and let the gas push the cork out in a controlled 
exodus. 
</P>
<P>
And drink your stars in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Champagne Star costs about $12 and is available throughout Southern 
California, including at Bullock's; The Broadway; Nordstom's; Williams-Sonoma; 
Trader Joe's; Kitchen World in Santa Monica; Wally's in Westwood; Bristol Farms 
in South Pasadena; Flask Liquor in Studio City; Kitchen Emporium in Torrance; 
Plaza Cutlery in Costa Mesa; Kitchen Fancy in Palm Desert, and Graffiti Inc. in 
San Diego.

STAGE WEEK: TOPOL FEELS LUCKY TO PLAY TEVYE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I don't know how they succeeded to twist my arm into doing it," kidded Topol 
about his reprise of Tevye in "Fiddler on the Roof," opening Wednesday at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion (and moving to Orange County Performing Arts Center 
Aug. 8). It marks the third stage go-round in the role for the Israeli-born 
actor, who put in "probably 400 performances" in 1967 and another 200 in 1983, 
not including his Academy Award-nominated work in the 1971 film. 
</P>
<P>
One of the differences in playing the role now is that Topol has experienced 
some of what Tevye is going through -- like the marrying off of one of his 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I know what it feels like -- and let me tell you, it's completely 
different (from acting it)," he said. "When I gave my daughter away, I had to 
rely on her instinct that she made the right decision. What are you going to do 
about it? She comes and says, 'This is the guy I'm in love with and I'm going 
to be with him,' and you say, 'Oh, yes. Good idea.' In this instance, it turned 
out very well; the guy is working with me now. So you say, 'Well, she was a 
clever girl. But really it was sheer luck." 
</P>
<P>
He counts himself as lucky to get another chance at Tevye. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy they asked me to do it -- and that I have the time to devote to 
it," he said of the five-month tour. "But I find it very demanding physically. 
It's not something I can throw off my sleeve. I hope I'm not repeating myself. 
I hope I've gained some experience as an actor -- otherwise I've wasted 22 
years." As for that, he chuckles, "I'm getting to the right age (53) to play 
him now. I have to put on less makeup. I don't have to bleach my beard, but I 
still have to put gray in my hair." 
</P>
<P>
Topol (who divides his time between homes in London and Tel Aviv) isn't 
surprised at the staying power of the show. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very good material, written by Sholom Aleichem, a lucky combination of 
(an adapting) team like Joseph Stein, Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock. And since 
it's set at the turn of the century, it doesn't age. Mainly it is a story about 
a person's relationships: with his wife, with his children, with his animals 
and with his Creator. Each of us experiences some of those relationships. So we 
recognize them, especially when it comes wrapped in genius choreography like 
Jerry Robbins' -- and hopefully some good actors are presenting it." 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: Keith Reddin's "Nebraska," about life at the bottom of a 
missile silo, recently premiered at La Jolla Playhouse. Les Waters directs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sylvie Drake in The Times: "It is the unlikely marriage of text (the 
perpetual deathwatch) and subtext (the profound unhappiness, boredom and waste 
it engenders) that has a gathering power. Reddin has turned a neat trick. He 
has issued a stern warning with a play that never stoops to preach." 
</P>
<P>
The Herald Examiner's Charles Marowitz found it "Neither 'black' nor comic and 
so the allegation that it is a 'black comedy' is merely an unfortunate piece of 
mislabeling. It is, however, gruelingly episodic and, despite the swiftness of 
the scene changes, the effect remains fragmentary and the action subject to 
constant interruption." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Diego Union, Welton Jones credited the British director for his 
canny attention to American detail: "Though fascinating, 'Nebraska' is a modest 
play, secure in its intentions and nicely adjusted to its most accessible 
level. What might be questioned is the wisdom of inquiring too closely into 
this priest class and its rituals." 
</P>
<P>
Said Daily Variety's Don Braunagel: "Reddin has created a sturdy and poignant 
comedy-drama having less to do with nuclear apocalypse than with the gradual 
destruction of relationships through noncommunication . . . . Loy Arcenas' set 
is excellent." 
</P>
<P>
And from Valerie Scher in the San Diego Tribune: "The fundamental message -- 
that warfare ain't what it used to be -- could use more fleshing out . . . Yet 
it's still a terrific production, shrewdly cast, smartly directed."

How ironic for Priscilla to say, " 'We are into preserving Elvis' name and 
image,' " when she published her book exposing Elvis' most intimate moments and 
then co-produced the TV miniseries aimed at eroding his reputation. If she felt 
"a cultural responsibility," she would handle his image with more taste. The 
love that existed between Elvis and his public has been destroyed by this 
crassness.

THE GODDESS THEORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regardless of the academic validity of Marija Gimbutas' studies, a case can be 
made for the benefits of a female ruler of a culture ("The Goddess Theory," by 
Jacques Leslie, June 11). The female, as carrier of future generations, would 
be more concerned with promoting a peaceful environment. Perhaps this kind of 
thinking may lead some brave women to become presidential candidates. It's 
about time.

THE MESSAGE OF 'DO THE RIGHT THING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Jewish Defense Organization is wrong to call for a boycott against "Do the 
Right Thing" (as reported in Steve Hochman's July 16 article, "The Aftermath of 
Public Enemy's Collapse"). 
</P>
<P>
Spike Lee's movie has a powerful message for all of society -- that all 
Americans should strive to understand one another in order to live together 
without hatred and violence. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the JDO should encourage viewing of the film in an effort to combat 
anti-Semitic prejudice such as that expressed by Prof. Griff of Public Enemy, 
the rap group that Hochman wrote about.

LATINO THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a Latina actress, I read with interest the views of Jose Armand on Latin 
theater in Los Angeles ("Paving the Way for Festival Latino," by Douglas 
Sadownick, July 9). However, I was dismayed at his comment that the Bilingual 
Foundation for the Arts is the only group that offers Latin theater on a 
regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
I am part of a theater ensemble named Sinergia and am appearing in an 
all-Spanish play, "Una Familia Tipo" ("A Family Type"), directed by Anibal 
Aprile, who last year won a Cesar Award for his play "Entre Las Redes" ("Caught 
in a Web"). The Cesar Award is presented to Latin theater actors, directors, 
authors, etc., by the Panamerican Theatrical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
I point out the Cesar Awards to Mr. Armand, who said in his interview that 
"there's no Latino theater award. . . . "

<P>
In 1979, my husband and I were in New York staying at the Wyndham, a small 
hotel catering to people in "show business." 
</P>
<P>
At lunch I glanced at another couple in the almost empty dining room, then 
turned to my husband and said, incredulously, "Is that Laurence Olivier?" I was 
not prepared to accept that time and illness had aged the "Maxim de Winter" I 
had fallen in love with when I was 20. 
</P>
<P>
As we were leaving, I timidly approached the actor. "All these years later, I 
have to tell you how I loved you in 'Rebecca,' " I said. He looked at me and 
replied softly, "Thank you, thank you, thank you." Then, reaching up he took 
both my hands in his and quietly continued, "Forgive me for not leaping to my 
feet, but I'm a little frail these days." 
</P>
<P>
I was literally transfixed by the graciousness and gentleness, not to mention 
the very presence, of this giant thespian. Need I say the moment is etched in 
my heart?

THE MESSAGE OF 'DO THE RIGHT THING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most important lesson to be learned from "Do the Right Thing" is that we 
are all globally linked. If we don't realize we are all in this together, the 
world will continue its rapid decay. 
</P>
<P>
In 50 years the Earth has become polluted almost beyond the point of saving, 
and we the public have to raise our voices as one and demand the end to the 
corruption in government and, most importantly, an end to the destruction of 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
To ignore these facts is certain to put an end to life. Wake up and do the 
right thing!

<TEXT>
<P>
In regard to Daniel Paul's July 9 letter stating that if it hadn't been for 
Neil Diamond the world would not have Bruce Springsteen's song "Born in the 
U.S.A." or the movie "Yentl": 
</P>
<P>
I find it unacceptable to think Mr. Springsteen had Neil Diamond anywhere on 
his mind while writing "Born in the U.S.A." just because America and U.S.A. are 
synonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The only similarities I can see between "Yentl" and the film "The Jazz Singer" 
is that both of their characters were Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
I have nothing against Neil Diamond. I am simply against the belief that Neil 
Diamond is God.

It is a laughable assertion that Bruce Springsteen would never have written 
"Born in the U.S.A.," about a bitter and disenfranchised Vietnam veteran, 
without the precedent of Neil Diamond's "America," an anthem so jingoistic it 
could be inscribed on the Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the myopic Mr. Paul derived his understanding of Springsteen's song 
from Ronald Reagan, who had obviously had heard only the title when he let the 
song be used in his '84 campaign.

U.S. SLOWDOWN SEEN AS GOOD SIGN OVERSEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent signs of gradual slowing in the U.S. economy have set some Americans to 
worrying about a possible recession, but the rest of the world views the somber 
news with distinct relief. 
</P>
<P>
Back home, the talk about a possible economic downturn has been seeping into 
forecasters' pronouncements. One of the most bearish, Wall Street economist A. 
Gary Shilling, believes that the U.S. economy "may well be already in a 
recession" and warns: "It could be long and deep." 
</P>
<P>
But overseas, forecasters are a lot less nervous. Rather than predicting a 
recession, they are confident that America is headed for a gradual slowdown 
that eventually will result in a long-hoped-for "soft landing" for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, they say, the world may avert some of the dangers that 
economists have been predicting for the past several months -- that a 
continually overheating U.S. economy might strain America's production 
capacity, spur more import buying and exacerbate inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Ulrich Ramm, chief economist for the Frankfurt-based Commerzbank, says 
the slowdown in sight seems likely to do the opposite -- trim the U.S. trade 
deficit, ease global inflation pressures and lower interest rates, thus helping 
Third World debtors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the prescription that the world economy needs," Ramm asserts. 
</P>
<P>
The easing of pressures around the globe was one of the major reasons that 
leaders of the world's seven largest industrial democracies steered clear of 
any major action at their annual economic summit meeting here last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth of the matter is that economic conditions around the world are very, 
very good, taking the broad view over time," U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas 
F. Brady asserted. "You don't want to change the throttle settings right now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharp Contrast 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Francois, economist for Banque National de Paris, agrees. After eight 
years of steady expansion, he said, a slowdown "is necessary for restoring the 
equilibrium of the American economy." He called the soft landing "an excellent 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
The situation is in marked contrast with that of only a few months ago: 
Interest rates were rising; the dollar was on the upswing, piercing the upper 
limits of the ranges that finance ministers of the industrial countries had set 
for it, and inflation was speeding up. 
</P>
<P>
Partly as a result, forecasts by the major international economic organizations 
were gloomy. Last autumn, for example, the Washington-based International 
Monetary Fund updated its annual outlook to predict increased inflation and the 
start of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
But now, with overheating no longer a danger in the United States and most 
analysts rejecting fears of recession as well, foreigners are becoming 
increasingly confident that the clouds of last March and April will yield a 
silver lining by late fall. 
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the 22-country Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development, a Paris-based forum for industrial countries, predicted that the 
long-sought soft landing is likely. It forecasts just enough growth to avoid a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Global Improvements 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, would help improve global economic conditions on several fronts: 
</P>
<P>
With the U.S. economy slowing, American consumers will temper their previous 
spending spree, cutting back on import buying and freeing up U.S. manufacturing 
plants to produce more for export. Lack of adequate production capacity has 
been limiting export sales. 
</P>
<P>
The result could be a far larger improvement in the U.S. trade deficit than had 
been expected. Tadashi Nakamae, a prominent Japanese economist, predicts that 
the U.S. trade deficit, forecast to be about $101 billion this year, could 
plunge another $30 billion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
To Commerzbank's Ramm, the continuation of the huge U.S. trade deficit -- and 
the corresponding oversized surpluses in West Germany and Japan -- represent 
"the No. 1 economic problem facing the world economy today. They are a sword 
hanging over us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramm also points out that less buoyant economic activity in the United States 
will help dampen demand for commodities and oil, stemming the recent rise in 
petroleum prices, which had been adding to existing price problems. 
</P>
<P>
A less frenetic U.S. economy could also ease broader inflation pressures in the 
United States, paving the way for further declines in American interest rates, 
which most likely would have an impact on global interest rates as well. 
</P>
<P>
That would help on two counts: It would ease inflation pressures globally -- 
important to countries such as Britain and Japan, where inflation seems to be 
back on the rise -- and it would help Third World debtors, whose debt burdens 
vary widely with interest-rate changes. 
</P>
<P>
J. Paul Horne, Paris-based managing director of Smith Barney, Harris Upham, the 
U.S. securities firm, notes that the rate to which interest charges on Third 
World loans are pegged -- the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate, known as LIBOR -- 
has fallen to 8.81% from a peak of 10.6% in March. 
</P>
<P>
With each percentage-point drop in the LIBOR rate worth about $1.5 billion in 
lower debt payments for the developing world, the 1.79-percentage-point drop 
recorded since March already has brought almost $3 billion in relief to Third 
World debtors and more seems on the way. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess will be that the LIBOR rate will be about 8% by year-end," Horne 
says. 
</P>
<P>
A continued decline in U.S. interest rates could also help stabilize exchange 
rates around the world -- which have been gyrating in recent months as interest 
rate differentials narrowed between the United States, West Germany and Japan 
-- and nudge the dollar down further. 
</P>
<P>
A rising dollar, such as seen in early May, forces America's trading partners 
to raise their own interest rates and sparks fears that U.S. exports will 
become less competitive, blunting further improvement in the U.S. trade 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Although some analysts have been urging U.S. officials to push the dollar even 
lower to help bring down the trade deficit, now at least, Horne asserts, the 
exchange markets will not have any artificial pressures. "The dollar is looking 
the way it should now," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Want to Prevent Speedup 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, not everyone abroad believes that the benefits from the predicted 
soft landing necessarily will be all that dramatic -- unless the economists are 
proved wrong and America ultimately falls into a full-fledged recession. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Nakamae, for example, states that with inflation having been 
accelerating for so long, the underlying inflation rate is so high that a sharp 
drop is virtually out of the question. "The most we can hope for is to prevent 
a further speedup," Nakamae said. 
</P>
<P>
And analysts are divided over just how much further interest rates will 
decline. Nakamae, again, is wary of rash predictions. "I don't think global 
interest rates will decline as much as expected," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the slowdown is welcome by any standard. Even countries such as Taiwan 
and South Korea that are heavily dependent on the sale of exports to the United 
States stand to gain more in broad economic terms than they will lose from the 
small falloff in sales. 
</P>
<P>
And with the West German and Japanese economies likely to continue in robust 
form this year and next, the global economy is not expected to suffer from the 
U.S. slackening. Europe, moving toward an integrated economy by 1992, "has a 
special dynamism," Ramm points out. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the prospect that the U.S. economy is finally beginning to slacken may 
be the best economic news that the rest of the world has had in months. "I'm 
very optimistic," says BNP's Gabriel Francois, who last year was predicting a 
U.S. recession.

JAMES FLANIGAN: MODERN TALE OF OLD-FASHIONED BUSINESS VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a family's commitment to Cummins Engine Co. last week there's a good story 
about American business, and a lesson or two about investment, too. 
</P>
<P>
J. Irwin Miller, the 80-year-old retired chairman of Cummins, and his sister 
Clementine -- descendants of William G. Irwin, the banker who first financed 
the 70-year-old Columbus, Ind., company -- paid $72 million to buy Cummins 
stock worth $67 million at market price to remove a takeover threat. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, they bought American history along with an increase in ownership 
-- to more than 10%, from roughly 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Cummins is the company that first put a diesel engine into an automobile and 
made the trucking industry economically possible by providing a cheaper 
alternative to gasoline. As the late Clessie Lyle Cummins tells it in his book 
"My Days with the Diesel," his engine company was slated for extinction in 
December, 1929. It had been making engines for luxury yachts, and the stock 
market crash had sunk the business. Banker Irwin, who was president of 
Columbus' Irwin-Union Trust Co., had told Cummins that the company had to 
close. 
</P>
<P>
But Cummins, a tinkerer with little formal education who had worked as a 
chauffeur for the Irwin family, had the idea of using diesels for automobiles. 
So he bought a used Packard and replaced its gasoline engine with a diesel. 
Then he took banker Irwin for a drive on the streets of Columbus, a town of 
35,000 south of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The engine worked, and talk of closing the company ended. Instead, Cummins took 
his car to the 1930 Automobile Show in New York, and later installed his engine 
in an 8-ton truck and drove from New York to Los Angeles on $11.38 worth of 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
The company grew to become today's $3.3-billion (sales) supplier of engines to 
roughly one of every two trucks on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work Still to Do 
</P>
<P>
But Cummins has had to fight for its leadership in this decade. Profits have 
been skimpy or non-existent most years, as Cummins slashed engine prices 30% to 
beat back a challenge from Japan's Komatsu and Nissan in 1984, and fought off 
Caterpillar and other U.S. competitors to hold its 54% share of the North 
American market. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Henry Schacht, 54, who succeeded Irwin Miller in 1973, has spent $2.3 
billion since 1980 on research, new products and plant modernization. As a 
result, Cummins has almost doubled its sales and kept costs in check. 
</P>
<P>
But there's work still to be done. Engine makers have to meet tighter pollution 
standards in 1991, and again in 1994. That will take investment, but by 
spending now, Cummins and other U.S. companies will have the engines needed by 
an environmentally conscious world. 
</P>
<P>
Still, after years of waiting for a payoff, some investors are impatient. They 
complain that "with truck buying turning down, the outlook for earnings (and 
the stock price) isn't strong," says analyst Larry Hollis of Milwaukee's Robert 
W. Baird &amp; Co. brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Cummins was the stock that Hanson PLC, a British company that buys and 
sells industrial firms, bought into last December. Hanson denied takeover 
plans, but Miller and Schacht feared mischief. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson is not the kind of company that spends money on plant and research the 
way Cummins does. More attuned to reaping than to planting, it has shown good 
profits with acquired companies by skimping on investment. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if Cummins had held back on investment the way Hanson does, it might 
have reported far higher profits in the 1980s. But it might also have lost out 
to competitors foreign and domestic. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin Miller -- the grand-nephew of W. G. Irwin, a hard-bitten banker who once 
told Clessie Cummins, "I'm putting money in the company, you're only putting in 
effort" -- no doubt knew Hanson's tricks and mistrusted their consequences. So 
he bought out Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
And made a smart investment. Because the next rise in the economy will be led 
by companies that serve industrial America -- like Cummins and Caterpillar and 
Ingersoll Rand. Analyst David Sutliff, of the investment bank S. G. Warburg, 
says Cummins is "likely to make a lot of money in the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
That would be a nice reward for the Miller family. But then, its fortune has 
been made all along by a commitment to American know-how. Maybe Wall Street 
could learn something in Columbus.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON: U.S. STAKE IN EAST BLOC IS

<P>
There is a specter haunting Eastern Europe. It is the specter of freedom. In 
Hungary and Poland democratic forces are pushing aside repressive Communist 
regimes. Other East European countries are under increasing pressure to 
liberalize. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have a humanitarian interest in greater freedom for Eastern Europe. 
The strengthening of democratic rights is a fundamental goal of American 
foreign policy. And greater freedom in the Eastern Bloc serves America's 
interest in ending the Cold War and promoting a unified, democratic Europe. 
</P>
<P>
While our diplomatic stake in Eastern European liberalization is enormous, our 
economic stake is limited. The whole of the Eastern Bloc, including the Soviet 
Union, accounts for only about 4% of world trade, and the lion's share of this 
trade is with Western Europe. Even a doubling of Eastern imports from the 
United States would increase U.S. exports by less than 1%, and more than half 
of this increase would come from the Soviet Union alone. 
</P>
<P>
For the citizens of Poland and Hungary, economic and political discontent are 
of equal urgency. Both countries face economic crises. They must compress 
domestic living standards, already woefully low, to repay huge Western loans. 
At the same time, they must embark on massive reform and investment efforts to 
improve the efficiency of their industries. 
</P>
<P>
The economic situation in Poland is particularly grim. Inflation is raging at 
an annual rate of more than 100%, and meat and other basic products are almost 
unobtainable except on the black market at exorbitant prices. In both 
countries, unemployment -- non-existent in socialist economies until recently 
-- is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Achieve 
</P>
<P>
Hungary and Poland are looking to the United States, Western Europe and Japan 
for economic support to ease their transition to democracy. They want more 
capital -- mainly through debt relief and joint ventures with Western companies 
-- and larger Western markets for their exports. 
</P>
<P>
There are formidable barriers to achieving these objectives. A dramatic 
expansion of Hungarian or Polish exports to Western markets is extremely 
unlikely in the short run. After decades of inefficient investment and poor 
quality control, not many Eastern products can compete with their Western 
counterparts. Nor is it likely that either Hungary or Poland will get much of 
the capital infusion that they hope for. Poland alone wants $10 billion of its 
debt rescheduled over the next three years. Foreign banks, especially the large 
European and Japanese banks that already have lent heavily to both countries, 
are more interested in the repayment of old loans than in extending new ones. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are the East Europeans likely to attract much private capital from Western 
firms, despite recent relaxation of their joint venture laws. Hungary and 
Poland have relatively little to offer foreign investors -- their labor costs 
are high compared to those in other parts of the world, their internal markets 
are sluggish, their technologies are outmoded and their political future is 
cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they are not part of the European Community, whose plan for a unified 
market by 1992 has attracted a flood of foreign investment. Poland and Hungary 
can only look on with envy as foreign investors shower money on Spain and 
Portugal, members of the European Community offering low labor costs, vigorous 
domestic markets and political stability. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debt Relief Needed 
</P>
<P>
Even if Hungary and Poland succeed in mobilizing significant financial support, 
it may buy little more than short-term relief. As the Polish experience of the 
1970s demonstrates, the mere presence of foreign capital, unallied to 
successful economic reform, will not improve economic performance in the long 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, what economic measures should the U.S. government 
take to encourage democracy in Poland and Hungary? 
</P>
<P>
First, the United States should cooperate with its Western allies to develop 
support programs. Meaningful debt relief must be part of these programs. As the 
United States is finally coming to realize after witnessing nearly a decade of 
depression and growing political instability in Latin America, heavily indebted 
nations cannot rebuild their economies while shipping massive amounts of 
capital back to their creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Poland should be included in Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's plan for 
debt rescheduling. Debt relief for Eastern Europe, however, should be a 
predominantly European initiative -- European banks are more heavily exposed 
than American banks, and the European countries have the greatest economic 
stake in Eastern Europe's revival. When reckoning its financial commitment to 
Eastern Europe, the United States must be mindful that a dollar of support for 
Eastern Europe may be one dollar less for Latin America, where our economic and 
political interests are much more pressing. 
</P>
<P>
Second, support programs for Poland and Hungary should be linked to meaningful 
economic reform whenever possible. President Bush's proposal for a fund to 
promote private sector development in Poland is an example of such linkage. 
Western leaders, however, must recognize that economic reform is a painfully 
slow, easily reversible process, with significant negative side effects in the 
form of unemployment, income inequity and inflation. Not even the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, with their vast experience in promoting 
economic development around the world, have managed to design a quick-fix 
reform program for socialist economies. There simply isn't any. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Encourage Trade Pacts 
</P>
<P>
Western nations also should relax discriminatory export and import controls on 
trade with the East. Hungary, like Poland and other members of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, should be granted "most favored nation" status 
on a permanent basis. And the United States should encourage the European 
Community to negotiate bilateral trade agreements that facilitate Polish and 
Hungarian integration into the unified European market. 
</P>
<P>
While easing discriminatory barriers to commercial relations with Eastern 
Europe, the United States should not actively subsidize such relations. 
Although there are both commercial and diplomatic benefits from expanded trade 
and investment with Eastern Europe, there is no reason to use preferential 
policies to promote them. Private decisions to trade or invest in Eastern 
European countries should be commercially, not politically, motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, both Western governments and Western businesses must recognize that 
there is no simple link between economic and political reform. The Chinese 
experience since 1978 vividly demonstrates that dramatic economic change can 
occur without greater democracy. Ironically, political liberalization in 
Eastern Europe may actually impede economic reform. It will be difficult for 
newly elected democratic leaders to convince their populations that they ought 
to accept even greater economic hardship today as a necessary prelude to future 
prosperity. They have chased such will-o-the-wisps before.

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: IF TIME, WARNER MERGE, WILL DAVIS BE FAR BEHIND? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will he or won't he? 
</P>
<P>
The "he" here is Martin S. Davis, chairman of Paramount Communications, and the 
biggest question gnawing at the wallets of Wall Street speculators right now is 
whether Davis will shoot the works by trying to acquire both Time Inc. and 
Warner Communications in what would be a $30-billion transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Chancellor William T. Allen in Delaware Chancery Court 
sided with Time Inc. by allowing it to go ahead with its acquisition of Warner 
Communications. Time and Warner had wanted to merge in a stock swap, but that 
plan was scrapped after Paramount upset the arrangements by making what ended 
up being a $200-a-share offer for Time. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's decision is being appealed Monday, but the guessing on Wall Street is 
that the Delaware Supreme Court will back Allen and permit Time and Warner to 
mate. So the question becomes: After Paramount loses in the higher court, will 
Davis decide to go after the combined Time-Warner company? 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Paramount/Time/Warner fiasco say there is only a slim 
chance that Paramount will try to buy both Warner and Time. 
</P>
<P>
But Wall Street's legion of speculators apparently think that Paramount will. 
The speculators think that Davis wouldn't give up this easily. They think that 
Davis will find himself a partner to split the $30-billion cost. 
</P>
<P>
If the street believed that Paramount was giving up, Time's stock could be down 
another $20 a share or so. Last week, it was trading in the high $130s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Murky Message 
</P>
<P>
Davis, as well as Paramount, is mum on the whole question of whether Paramount 
will try to acquire Time and Warner. (Paramount could ruin its court appeal by 
letting the cat out of the bag.) 
</P>
<P>
Here's what is known so far. In a deposition before the Delaware court, Davis 
is reported to have said that he hadn't decided whether Paramount would go for 
the combined company. (The deposition, however, is still secret, so Davis' 
entire statement isn't really known.) 
</P>
<P>
Up to that point, the situation was clear-cut. Davis had a decision to make. 
</P>
<P>
After that, however, things got rather murky. A few days after Davis was 
deposed in court, Paramount said a "Time Warner deal effectively precludes any 
bidder at all, and absolutely precludes any bidder at a price anywhere near 
$200 a share. And that includes us." 
</P>
<P>
Huh? What does that mean? 
</P>
<P>
Does it mean that Paramount won't bid? Or does it mean that Paramount simply 
will wait for Time's stock to fall in price after it combines with Warner (as 
it has already done) and then go after Time Warner at something considerably 
less than $200 a share? 
</P>
<P>
Here's what Wall Street sources working on the Time/Warner/Paramount situation 
think. 
</P>
<P>
"Paramount has never absolutely slammed the door" on a bid for Time Warner, 
said one Wall Street source close to the situation. "But they have hinted that 
it is highly unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heavy Debt 
</P>
<P>
Said another source familiar with the situation: "Davis tends not to shut doors 
unnecessarily." No comment, he says, to the specific question of whether Davis 
is considering a bid for Time Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Source No. 1, however, says it is his personal view that there is only a 5% to 
10% chance that Davis will decide to pursue the Time Warner acquisition, whose 
$30-billion price tag would include the assumption of up to $15 billion in debt 
that Time will take on when it acquires Warner. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any way to suggest at this point that it's a serious 
option," added the source. "It's a theoretical option only." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Paramount did decide to go after Time Warner, another source says it is 
unlikely that the newly formed company would sit back and watch without taking 
action. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Time borrowed nearly $28 billion to complete the Warner 
acquisition, which is twice what it needs even if it decided to pay $70 cash 
for all of Warner's stock. 
</P>
<P>
The borrowings are four times what Time would need to acquire Warner if it 
decides to pay cash for only 100 million of Warner's shares and exchange the 
other 100 million for stock. 
</P>
<P>
This source suggests that it might come down to Time playing dueling bankrolls 
with Paramount. "I don't believe Martin Davis has gone away yet. I haven't seen 
any white flags," he said, adding that Time might have to outbid Paramount for 
Time's own stock when all is said and done. 
</P>
<P>
Here's one last idea on where to find hidden corporate assets that, once 
discovered, could lead to takeover attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Hackel of Systematic Financial Management, Ft. Lee, N.J., says a 
company's assets sometimes get hidden inadvertently in overspending. If a 
company spends too much in one year on capital improvements, Hackel says a 
raider might see this and, realizing that the company's profits and stocks are 
being abnormally depressed by this spending, initiate an attack on that 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Hackel, in fact, claims that there is a "very high correlation" between 
companies whose spending has risen to abnormal levels and those taken over. 
</P>
<P>
Among the companies that recently showed up on Hackel's list as having 
abnormally high spending are: H. B. Fuller Co., Rohm &amp; Haas Co., V. F. 
Corp., Lance Inc., Bristol-Myers, Emerson Electric, Hillenbrand Industries and 
Melville Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of H. B. Fuller, Hackel says the Minneapolis-based specialty 
chemical company spent $40.2 million last year on capital expenditures. It 
averaged just $24.3 million in capital spending in the previous four years. 
</P>
<P>
Hackel says that after allowing for what he considers "normal" capital spending 
growth, he estimates that H. B. Fuller's "excess" capital spending was $7.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
A raider could cut capital spending, improve the company's earnings and stock 
price, and thus tap another "hidden" corporate asset." 
</P>
<P>
Even if you are only a casual follower of Coca-Cola Co., you probably have 
heard that the Atlanta soft-drink giant has had enough of the entertainment 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Coke bought Columbia Pictures, the movie studio that made the infamous "Ishtar" 
movie, in the late 1970s. But Coke sold 51% of the company to the public a few 
years ago and has been widely rumored to be ready to give up the remaining 49% 
to the right bidder. 
</P>
<P>
"My gut feeling is a large company from the Far East would pay a fairly large 
price" for Columbia Pictures, says Joseph Doyle, an analyst with Smith Barney, 
Harris Upham &amp; Co. Two names being mentioned recently as potential buyers 
are Sony Corp. and Mitsubishi Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coke's business has been doing what Coke's business always does -- 
growing. Joseph Frazzano of Oppenheimer &amp; Co., for instance, thinks that 
Coke will earn $3.40 a share this year, compared to $2.85 a share in 1988. Its 
earnings in 1990 will rise by about the same amount, Frazzano says. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, however, the company's profits have been growing faster in Europe than 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing exciting about Coke these days, in fact, is the situation at 
Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Frazzano says Coke has never said it is interested in selling Columbia 
Pictures. "They've said that there is a lot of interest from other companies in 
buying it. But for the right price they might be talked into selling it," 
Frazzano adds. 
</P>
<P>
The right price, the analysts say, would probably be in the high $20s. The 
stock was mired in the low $20s last week, and even that was 75% higher than 
the stock's level at the beginning of this year. 
</P>
<P>
There is one other mystery surrounding Coca-Cola these days. A usually reliable 
Wall Street source of mine swears that Coke recently purchased 3% of Paramount 
Communications, the entertainment company that is trying to buy Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The source's story couldn't be confirmed independently. But if true, it would 
mean that Coke isn't really down on the entertainment business. It is simply 
down on its entry in that business, Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently you can't keep an indicted man down. A Wall Street source says John 
Mulheren, who is accused of committing securities laws violations on Ivan F. 
Boesky's behalf, has been telling people that he's opening a boat company in 
Florida. Thomas Puccio, Mulheren's attorney, didn't return telephone calls. 
Several weeks ago, Puccio denied reports that Mulheren, a resident of luxurious 
Rumson, N.J., had moved to Florida. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The takeover business has been slow since before summer began, but a Wall 
Street source who usually has a good feel for the number of undisclosed deals 
in the pipeline says things are starting to get busy. But he says the deals are 
"not big, penny-ante stuff" . . . Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, an 
out-placement service, says 2% of the 600 fired managers it recently surveyed 
could be considered suicidal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the reduction in banks' prime lending rate that was supposed 
to be such a sure thing? An official of one major New York money center bank 
said his and other big banks weren't really convinced that the Federal Reserve 
was dedicated to lowering interest rates. So they didn't follow New York's 
Chase Manhattan Bank and Southwest Bank of St. Louis down to the lower 10.5% 
level on the prime a few weeks ago. The lower-than-expected rise in consumer 
prices announced last week could make believers of the other banks . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ryder Systems stock has been trading extra heavily the past few weeks, and the 
company is concerned enough to have asked its proxy solicitor, D. F. King &amp; 
Co., to find out why, according to a Wall Street source.

DIGGING OUT OF DEBT; 
</P>
<P>
THE U.S. IS HOPING THAT THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES PAY US SO WE CAN PAY JAPAN AND 
GERMANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MAYER, MARTIN MAYER, author of The Bankers and Markets, is working on 
a book about savings and loans. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the debts of the less developed countries rose to the top of the world 
agenda in the summer of 1982, the United States argued that if these nations 
would adopt sensible economic policies such as our own, they would be able to 
pay what they owed. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, they might need a few more loans as part of their morning after, but if 
they got up earlier and worked harder, sincerely worshiped at the shrine of The 
Market and ungrudgingly accepted its assigned penance of austerity, all would 
soon be well. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last summer's economic summit, former President Ronald Reagan 
and then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III brushed aside Japanese and 
French suggestions that something be done to reduce the burden that poor people 
in poor countries had to carry so their governments could make payments in 
dollars to rich banks in rich countries. 
</P>
<P>
But when the leaders of the free world met last weekend in Paris with debt as a 
centerpiece topic, the United States urged them all to lean on their banks to 
forgive a fraction of the hundreds of billions of dollars in loans 
improvidently made to LDCs and to their enterprises in the 1970s and early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and their advisers 
believe that the American position has changed because a careful policy review 
indicated that the debtors were sinking rather than swimming and needed a life 
preserver. 
</P>
<P>
Amused observers outside the United States, however, note an obvious obeisance 
to the rule that where you stand depends on where you sit. When Americans were 
the world's biggest creditors, we thought everybody ought to pay up. Now that 
we are the world's biggest debtors, we find virtue in debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Third World debt is a crisis not because the borrowers can't pay, which was 
predicted for a long, long time. If Brazil, Mexico and Argentina owed West 
Germany, Japan and Switzerland, the debt dilemma would become a mere problem, 
easily solved. What makes it so difficult is that they owe us, and we in turn 
owe West Germany and Japan and Switzerland. These Latin debts are our assets, 
and to the extent that we write them off, our own net international 
indebtedness goes up. 
</P>
<P>
The situation that had developed before this year was rather like the unhappy 
triangle of the 1920s, when the French and the British had to demand payment of 
German war reparations because the United States was insisting that they repay 
their war loans. Among the results was hyper-inflation in Germany that now 
looks to be replicated in Argentina and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Once it became generally understood that the Germans simply couldn't do what 
they had agreed to do, various Dawes Plans and Young Plans and the like were 
invented to maintain the pretense that the debts were being both serviced and 
reduced. The Brady Plan announced March 10 fits into this grand tradition. It 
is like its predecessors, too, in its inadequacy. 
</P>
<P>
The attractiveness of debt reduction for the United States is that it's a way 
to make others bear the costs. Calling for debt reduction, we call also for 
help from the Japanese and the Germans, for contributions to the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank that will guarantee the value of the Latin 
debt that survives the rather small reductions now contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
The markets have understood that debt reduction Brady-style would be good for 
American banks and would not impair the real American net position with the 
rest of the world. Stocks of money center banks that have heavy Latin exposure 
have been star performers for the past four months, and the Treasury has had to 
worry that our high interest rates make the dollar too buoyant, not that our 
debt weighs it down. 
</P>
<P>
However motivated, American acceptance of the need for debt reduction 
represents a small step toward sanity. Just about every debt-issuing agency in 
this hemisphere, public or private, has put out too much of the stuff. Adding 
to their total debt, which was the U.S. recommendation until recently, was 
certainly not going to make the Latin countries more credit-worthy. New money, 
moreover, helps only for this year and makes things tougher next year, while 
debt reduction means less interest to pay forever. 
</P>
<P>
But we're still only partway to reality, because Americans still think that 
what Washington decides will determine what happens. And the truth is that the 
time for Baker Plans and Brady Plans has passed. 
</P>
<P>
Slaying the debt dragon now requires a Miyazawa Plan or a Poehl Plan or a 
Camdessus Plan. We can suggest and influence and ultimately, if we dig in our 
heels, forbid. But the cup of decision making in these areas has passed from 
our lips. If we can't afford to play the game, we can't insist on making the 
rules.

'ADVOCACY' MESSAGES TIMED TO WIN SUPPORT IN CONGRESS

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As sprightly martial music thrums in the background, the screen fills with 
grainy film clips of military planes in action. Each one, an announcer intones, 
was built or designed by Northrop Corp. "Now, the B-2," the voice-over says, as 
the sleek black vehicle wheels into view. "America's most thoroughly tested new 
bomber." 
</P>
<P>
Northrop, which has been running that 30-second ad for the past few days, isn't 
asking viewers of "Good Morning America" and "The Tonight Show" to purchase a 
Stealth bomber of their very own -- not at $530 million apiece -- but it's 
doing a selling job nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
With Congress preparing to debate the defense budget this week, the Southern 
California-based aerospace contractor has been flooding Washington's airwaves 
as part of its lobbying efforts to save the $70-billion project, of which it is 
the prime contractor. 
</P>
<P>
In a flurry of local newspaper ads and television commercials, other 
military-hardware manufacturers are scrambling to raise their profiles, too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TV Ads for V-22 Osprey 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Corp., the prime contractor on the F-15E, a controversial jet 
fighter project, for example, has been telling readers of the Washington Post 
and other publications circulated in Washington that its aircraft "is twice the 
plane compared to any single fighter." Viewers of Sunday morning public affairs 
shows have been getting a look at the V-22 Osprey, a plane that takes off like 
a helicopter, thanks to Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing-Vertol, its 
co-manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Buying an ad to tout a pet project has long been used to support more 
conventional forms of lobbying, but the current outpouring of "advocacy" 
messages comes at a time when Congress faces an unusual number of hard choices 
involving military procurement. After years of steady buildup at the Defense 
Department, the federal budget deficit is forcing Capital Hill to consider 
scrapping several big-ticket projects, including the B-2, F-15E, V-22 and an 
upgraded F-14. 
</P>
<P>
These high-stakes decisions appear to be compelling the blitz of advertising: 
"We're seeing the whole defense industry under attack," said Jerry Mosier, a 
New York advertising executive who edits a newsletter about advocacy campaigns. 
"Everyone from the F-14 makers to the nuclear-widget industry is out there 
trying to get its message across." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expensive Advertising 
</P>
<P>
Mosier said the number of advocacy ads has increased 35% since last year, with 
defense-related ads up strongly, according to a cross section of national 
publications tracked by his publication. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike traditional advertising, which seeks to influence a broad number of 
people, advocacy ads that appear in Washington are ultimately aimed at one of 
the smallest audiences around: the 535 members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
This makes advocacy advertising unusually expensive on a cost-per-viewer basis. 
A full-page ad that appears once in the Post, for instance, costs $36,894 
($45,144 on Sunday), a page in the New York Times' National Edition runs 
$45,677 ($55,244 on Sunday), and the Wall Street Journal gets $41,665 for a 
full page in the edition that circulates in Washington. Northrop is spending 
more than $60,000 on its B-2 television spots, which will run for the next 
several weeks primarily on news shows, said Les Daly, the company's senior vice 
president of advertising. Daly wouldn't disclose the print budget. 
</P>
<P>
Those who create advocacy campaigns said that to persuade members of Congress 
first requires convincing the people immediately around them, including staffs, 
lobbyists, Administration officials and the media. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ads Are Risky 
</P>
<P>
"All of this is to give the various companies visibility with some of the 
people here who may have influence" on the decision makers, said Loye Miller, a 
spokesman for Northrop's local office. 
</P>
<P>
Added Tom Garbett, a consultant who helps create corporate ad campaigns, "The 
content of the ad may or may not convince someone, but it creates an 
atmosphere, an ambience in which the issue is important. It helps establish it 
in the public debate. Unfortunately, congressmen and their staffs aren't 
dealing with the public, but if they perceive it as important to them, it puts 
the issue right in front of them." 
</P>
<P>
While it's often difficult to measure the effectiveness of any advocacy ad, 
several consultants say they can do as much harm as good. Some ads wind up 
galvanizing an otherwise disorganized opposition, Garbett said. 
</P>

Al Ries, a marketing consultant who co-authored the books "Positioning" and 
"Marketing Warfare," said Northrop in particular is risking a strong backlash 
by taking its case to the public. "People are going to think, 'why the hell do 
we need the B-2 when everything is candy and flowers between us and the 
U.S.S.R? What in the hell are we spending $500 million per plane for?' " 
</P>
<P>
Noting that development costs on the B-2 already have surpassed $22 billion, 
Ries suggested that Northrop should have adopted "the shame approach" in its 
campaign. "The message should be, 'we've put so much money into this plane on 
the ground, it would be a shame not to put it into the air now.' "

The Moscow suicide of former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst Glenn Michael 
Souther last month only confirmed what CIA defector-handlers have been saying 
for years -- that switching sides is an act of personal desperation and the 
landing is rarely soft. Souther's story is sad but typical: First he sold 
secrets to the Soviets, then he panicked three years ago when an FBI 
interrogation convinced him the spy-hunters were closing in. The Soviets seem 
to have handled his escape with professional skill, but bungled the follow-up 
-- the delicate task of creating a new "home" for a man who left everything 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
If Souther's suicide was really a suicide -- probable but not certain -- his 
KGB handlers have doubtless been called on the carpet for the sort of grilling 
that would have once led to Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
Their CIA counterparts would be sympathetic. In the 40 years they have been 
recruiting, debriefing and resettling Soviet defectors, they have learned the 
hard way that the political and intelligence officials who show up on Western 
doorsteps are often unstable personalities, going through something akin to a 
nervous breakdown. Often defectors have changed their minds and gone home -- 
but none more publicly than KGB officer Vitaly S. Yurchenko, who held a 
Washington press conference in 1985 to announce his second thoughts. More 
recently, KGB Col. Viktor P. Gundarev, who defected in February, 1986, 
contacted writer David Wise to complain of insensitive and sometimes highhanded 
treatment by the CIA. The agency has denied the charges but a congressional 
hearing has been promised. 
</P>
<P>
CIA officers who have handled defectors say no two cases are the same, but most 
have certain common characteristics. Perhaps most important: Virtually all are 
"walk-ins" -- Soviet Bloc officials who contact Western governments to 
volunteer their services. Almost all important defectors have simply showed up 
to sell secrets or plead for asylum. In most cases, the motive is a personal 
crisis -- a failing marriage, heavy debts, professional disappointments, even 
fear of arrest. This despite the fact that CIA stations worldwide devote much 
time to gathering information about East Bloc officials who might be recruited 
-- building up huge files on potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Standard CIA procedure is to attempt to persuade the volunteer to return home 
and work as a spy for a time in return for a promise of future resettlement. 
Sometimes it works, more often not. 
</P>
<P>
Once a volunteer has been accepted as a defector the personal crisis deepens. 
Within a day or two the defector realizes he can change his mind only at the 
risk of his life; friends and family are left behind;, the people handling him 
are strangers; he feels totally alone. Sensitive handling is critical, just as 
it will be later, when the defector has been pumped of all immediately useful 
information and begins to lose his luster. What defectors need at both 
junctures are friendly faces that do not change too frequently, familiar food 
and surroundings, reassurance they will be protected from the long arm of the 
KGB and confidence they are not going to be set adrift on the alien ocean of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Defectors generally say that few things are more important than hearing and 
speaking their own language. In its early days, the CIA had plenty of native 
Russian-speakers, but they have long-since died or retired. The agency is now 
hard put to find fluent Russian linguists. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA has handled scores of defectors more or less successfully -- but 
sometimes it all goes wrong. The case of Yurchenko is an administrative and 
human horror story from start to finish. Yurchenko complained when debriefings 
were conducted in English, emphasizing his feeling of dislocation. His 
questioners pumped him relentlessly for operational detail, and then fanned his 
personal fears by passing on his still-warm secrets to the press. Loneliness 
increased after an affair collapsed when his lover refused to join him in 
exile. He began to miss his daughter and adopted son in Moscow. None of this 
seems to have been picked up by his CIA handlers. 
</P>
<P>
Yurchenko's three-page biography, released by the CIA after his embarrassing 
redefection, suggests he was genuine, not an agent dispatched to muddy the 
waters as some claimed. Questions of allegiance are difficult to answer, but it 
seems the CIA squandered an important source of information by its failure to 
hold Yurchenko's hand through an agonizing period of psychological adjustment 
that can seem like dying. 
</P>
<P>
One chronic weakness of agency handling has been its appetite for operational 
details -- especially nuggets of hard counterintelligence information with the 
average life-span of a black fly. Agency handlers well know that a pell-mell 
damage assessment will begin as soon as a defector is missed. If investigators 
don't move quickly they will find the scene swept clean and suspects whisked 
off before the Black Maria can arrive. But the U.S. government has a voracious 
appetite for personal information about their shadowy opponents and the CIA 
debriefers lose no time in passing on gossip about the Soviets and their 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has talked to defectors will remember initial puzzlement at the 
weirdly detailed stories of human failings and bureaucratic infighting behind 
the Iron Curtain. This compulsive retailing of scandal is a kind of debriefing 
shell shock. Defectors are only human; they quickly learn that Washington ears 
prick up at the first breath of venal or sexual intrigue. Yet most defectors 
resent that initial punishing period of long days when teams of debriefers drag 
out every last detail. The unhappy defector is at least the center of attention 
while being sucked dry. Worse is the arrival of the clerical drones to tidy the 
paper work -- a sure sign the intelligence professionals have lost interest. At 
that point the promise of meaningful work is what defectors need, but rarely 
get. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism of CIA defector-handling sparked by the Yurchenko case, and 
revived by Gundarev's complaints, is only the latest appearance of an old 
problem dating back to the earliest days of Western relations with the Soviet 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
No nation has ever had more defectors over a longer period of time than the 
Soviet Union -- and the rest of the world has never depended more heavily on 
defectors for important information about an opponent. Secrecy was clamped down 
immediately after the 1917 October Revolution; Soviet borders were all but 
sealed to emigration by the end of the 1920s, and the Soviet population was 
effectively cut off from contact with foreigners inside the country by the 
purges of the 1930s. The result was the world's first modern totalitarian 
society -- opaque and conspiratorial. Outsiders had only two sources of 
information: passive clues such as the lineup of leaders during May Day parades 
and the testimony of defectors. One of the first was Boris Bajanov, who had 
been Josef Stalin's personal secretary in the early 1920s, closely followed by 
Georges Agabekov, the OGPU agent in charge of the hunt for Bajanov. 
</P>
<P>
Much important Soviet history is still known only from the reports of defectors 
-- but Western analysts and intelligence officers were slow to learn how to 
exploit it. Two defectors from the NKVD of the 1930s, Walter Krivitsky and 
Alexander Orlov, provided much of what the West knows about Stalin's conduct of 
the purges. But neither was systematically debriefed by U.S. intelligence 
organizations. The FBI first learned of Krivitsky after his memoirs ran in the 
Saturday Evening Post in 1939. They had still not questioned him when he was 
found dead in a hotel room two years later, an apparent suicide. Orlov defected 
in 1938, but entered the United States secretly and remained in hiding until 
1953. Some CIA officers valued what Orlov could tell them but most of them 
thought it ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
Defectors continued to be an important source of information about Soviet 
politics and leaders after World War II, and the Soviets took extraordinary 
measures to prevent their escape. In one celebrated case of the early 1950s, 
teams of CIA and KGB officers tore a Vienna restaurant apart in their battle 
over a Soviet diplomat who could not make up his mind to flee or to stay. 
</P>
<P>
On other occasions the Soviets have snatched would-be defectors from under the 
noses of Western intelligence officers. But it rarely comes to that. The first 
line of Soviet defense has been the isolation of citizens and officials. 
Diplomats abroad live in supervised compounds; their older children are 
educated in the Soviet Union where they serve in effect as hostages. Official 
delegations are routinely accompanied by KGB guards who read the roll call 
morning, noon and night. When defectors manage to slip through the net, the 
Soviets try to lure them back, promising forgiveness and arranging for tearful 
phone calls with relatives. 
</P>
<P>
But successful escape in the past did not end Soviet interest. Those who made 
it safely knew the KGB's memory was long -- over the years many have been 
murdered or kidnaped or died mysteriously. In the early 1970s, a Russian emigre 
organization in West Germany obtained a KGB wanted list that included names and 
descriptions of about 470 defectors between 1945 and 1969, many under sentence 
of death for illegal departure. This document was used as the basis for a study 
of Soviet defectors by Vladimir Krasnov, who fled a Soviet tour group in 1962 
and is now a professor at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
In "Soviet Defectors," Krasnov found that defections offered a barometer of the 
quality of Soviet life. Russians were unhappiest, and most likely to defect, 
during the rigors of the Stalinist period. When life opened up, as it did under 
Nikita S. Khrushchev, defections dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Krasnov's book was completed before Mikhail S. Gorbachev began his reformation 
of Soviet society. But if the past is any guide, then the defection of ordinary 
Soviet citizens to the West has probably fallen off -- it is easier to leave 
legally, and not so many want to go. Gorbachev's most important break with 
Soviet custom has been his willingness to risk glasnost -- a combination of 
open politics, free discussion and telling the truth about the Soviet past. But 
some observers suspect that Gorbachev is saying one thing in public and another 
in the Politburo. If this should be true, then a defector will probably be 
first to bring the news.

TWO SUPERPOWERS CLIMBING THE HIGH ROAD UP FROM HOSTILITY

<TEXT>
<P>
George Bush's recent visit to Poland featured the bizarre spectacle of an 
American President praising a Polish dictator. Yet Bush's support of 
now-elected Wojciech Jaruzelski helps legitimize public debate on a genuine 
dilemma facing the United States in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The United States wants to free the East Europeans without offending the 
Soviets. It wants change in the political order in Eastern Europe but is wary 
of change in the security order. 
</P>
<P>
Is the former possible without the latter? Even today, many observers doubt 
that the Soviets will be able to accept changes now under way in Eastern 
Europe. They anticipate an explosion that will end the promise of Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's revolution. In the words of a recent RAND Corp. study, "Today, 
Eastern Europe's persisting structural instability poses the greatest single 
threat of a major discontinuity in international politics." 
</P>
<P>
Events in Eastern Europe could indeed spin out of control, but part of the 
great pessimism many experts express about future Soviet policy toward Eastern 
Europe may rest on a dated view of East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
Many, perhaps most, Western observers see Gorbachev as an aberration. In terms 
of attitudes toward Eastern Europe, the majority of Soviet leaders are seen as 
little changed from the 1950s. But it can be argued that ever since the death 
of Josef Stalin, the Soviet Union has been making fitful efforts to become a 
normal member of the international community. Gorbachev's genius would then 
lie, not in discontinuity, but in so accelerating the pace of change that the 
West at last begins to recognize it. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, we can see roughly four periods in East-West relations since 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
The Cold War, 1945-55: Soviet consolidation of control in Eastern Europe and 
American consolidation of influence in Western Europe. New lines of hostility 
were drawn down the center of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But any permanent "cold" required an enemy incapable of evolving into a more 
normal international partner. Stalin's death in 1953 began the evolution. As 
soon as the regime stopped shooting people, cracks started appearing in the 
totalitarian structure and the Soviets began their journey toward normality. By 
1955 the stage was set for Stalin himself to be denounced officially -- and he 
was at the 20th Party Congress the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Defense of the status quo, 1955-65: The two sides essentially tested boundaries 
of the postwar division of power but they drew back from any ultimate challenge 
to those boundaries. Each side attempted to stir rebellion in the other camp. 
But the invasion of Hungary, the Berlin Wall and the Cuban missile crisis 
established just how stable the new status quo already was. 
</P>
<P>
Detente, 1965-1975: With boundaries firmly set, the two sides could begin 
cautiously exploring areas of common interest within an established security 
framework. The fruits of this effort were the non-proliferation treaty, the 
first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Wary cooperation, 1975-Present: Although boundaries were fixed in Europe, they 
had remained fluid in the Third World. Superpower conflict centered in the 
Third World but both sides quickly learned that they had to observe certain 
rules of the road. Like the United States in Korea and Vietnam, the Soviet 
Union in Afghanistan acted according to a certain code of conduct, however 
brutal. Like the United States, the Soviet Union did not invade the neighboring 
state that gave provisions to the forces it was fighting. Like the United 
States in Korea and Vietnam, the Soviet Union used enormous power in 
Afghanistan but stopped short of applying its full might. And like the United 
States, the Soviet Union also did not allow its anger -- when the great rival 
helped feed the rebellion -- to end relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that the U.S. defeat in Vietnam and the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan 
finally established the code of conduct in Third World crises. With such 
behavior established, cooperation could begin between the two superpowers in 
resolving some of these conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Can the process now be extended to understandings between superpowers about 
political change in their respective areas of influence? There is no clear 
reason why the answer should be negative. Either by itself or with other 
regional powers, no country in Eastern Europe or Central America threatens the 
security of the Soviet Union or the United States. Only when political change 
in these areas becomes linked in some way to the foreign-policy designs of 
either superpower do security considerations come into play. In other words, 
there is no reason for a Brezhnev Doctrine or a Monroe Doctrine if there is no 
extra regional power attempting to take advantage of political change in a way 
that could tilt the global balance. 
</P>
<P>
Some months ago, Henry A. Kissinger was heavily criticized because one of his 
columns was interpreted to suggest a second Yalta, another great-power effort 
to arrange the affairs of Europe. A real attempt at condominium would be 
overreaching and would fail. But there is no reason why the superpowers cannot 
reassure one another about actions taken as inevitable change takes place in 
regions of special concern and sensitivity. Thus Moscow and Washington could 
each: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reaffirm that its principal concern was national security, not the internal 
order of neighboring states. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reassure neighboring states that it understood its commitments under the 
U.N. Charter regarding the use of force. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pledge publicly that it would not seek nor accept military facilities or 
special privileges of any sort in the zone of concern to the other side. 
(Consistent with that pledge, Moscow could pledge to withdraw military 
personnel from Cuban soil once Washington had succeeded in establishing normal 
diplomatic relations with Cuba.) 
</P>
<P>
There may yet be a tragedy in Eastern Europe. But even in that event, the 
process of Soviet international normalization is not likely to come to a 
permanent halt. The process begun so long ago will one day resume. As 
international politics become less ideological, the Soviet Union can relax its 
grip on Eastern Europe just as the United States can relax its grip on its own 
region. We should all hope that day comes sooner rather than later.

Aharoni's article is so filled with hatred and anti-Arab racism that it is 
pointless to rebut in detail his opinions. A man with his opinions is not 
interested in discussion, just transferring Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
And, as usual, Paul Conrad's political cartoon, which depicted a bus being 
driven by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir going over a cliff, was on the 
mark. Likud's four restrictions on Palestinian elections destroy the prospects 
for peace between Israelis and Palestinians and set the stage for the transfer 
of Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
If the Israeli people and their government decide to implement an expulsion 
policy, then the American people and our government must remain committed to 
our values and principles and suspend both military and economic aid to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
That some Israelis and Jewish-Americans would even consider the idea of a mass 
expulsion of Palestinians should give us pause.

The two columns point up the tragedy inherent in the Israeli-Palestinian 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni mentions the Arab terrorist who murdered 16 bus passengers recently. 
Certainly this is a reprehensible act and should be condemned. But he doesn't 
mention the 20,000 Arab homes destroyed by the Israeli military. Violence on 
both sides is reprehensible. It should be emphasized that the vast majority of 
Israelis and Palestinians reject violence. He also mentions that proposals to 
allow elections among Arabs in Judea, Samaria and Gaza have not brought peace. 
What he doesn't mention is that these would not be truly free elections because 
the Palestinians would still be subservient to the Israeli government. 
</P>
<P>
Harkabi's main point is that neither side should allow the extremists to take 
over. If they do, then catastrophe is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
In this crisis tolerance must become the norm and not the exception. Equality 
must be available to all, not just a select few. If these points are not 
recognized, then the Israelis and Palestinians will continue to march toward 
mutual destruction.

COURT RULING ON HOLIDAY DISPLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So the Supreme Court is confused about how to apply the First Amendment 
provision about religion to the display of creches, saying that it is all right 
in one situation but not in another. That the Supreme Court can't make up its 
mind whether or not it is all right to display a creche is odd because the 
First Amendment is straightforward and to the point about religion. 
Paraphrased, it says, "Don't establish an official religion and do let people 
practice religion freely." 
</P>
<P>
All that is necessary in judging a situation is to turn those two ideas into 
the questions: "Does it establish an official religion?" and "Does it interfere 
with the practice of religion?" Any time the answer to both is "no," the 
situation is acceptable. There is a simple solution. 
</P>
<P>
Invite each of the major religions -- Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, 
Hinduism, Shintoism, Zoroastrianism and American Indian -- to pick a major 
holiday season from its religious calendar and, during that season, to have a 
display in public places and to present programs in school. In that way, 
religion is freely exercised; no official religion is established; everybody 
has a chance to learn something about everybody else. This is called "being 
ecumenical."

SOMETHING CAN BE DONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The killing of 21-year-old actress Rebecca Schaeffer, who was shot dead in the 
doorway of her Fairfax District apartment building last week, is one of those 
terrible contemporary tragedies that leaves people wringing their hands and 
saying that nothing can be done. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, something can be done, even if, as police and prosecutors allege, Miss 
Schaeffer's assailant was a disturbed young man whose fan's crush on a young 
actress somehow mutated into a murderous obsession. 
</P>
<P>
The deviant and the deranged always have been with us. Their presence is an 
unavoidable fact of life. The presence of cheap, easily obtainable, easily 
concealable handguns is not. It is an artifact of human folly. Or, rather, it 
is a peculiarly American folly, born of the fact that across this country 
craven lawmakers persist in behaving as if the legislative bodies to which they 
were elected are subsidiaries of the National Rifle Assn.

Crimes such as that committed against Miss Schaeffer attract public sympathy 
and revulsionbecause the victims are well-known. But weekly, young people in 
South and East Los Angeles and in poor and working-class communities all over 
America are gunned down in the streets by people wielding firearms a sane 
society long ago would have jerked from their hands. There are no film records 
or glossy publicity photos to mark their brief lives. There are only the fading 
snapshots in family albums and the memories in the minds of their grieving 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
If they were given the opportunity to speak, they might echo Danna Schaeffer, 
Rebecca's mother, who said Thursday that while she harbors no animosity toward 
her daughter's alleged killer, she is "angry at the system that allows things 
like this to happen, that allows a deranged person to get his hands on a deadly 
weapon." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of rational handgun regulation must not be allowed to turn the Second 
Amendment into a blood-stained abstraction. They must not be allowed to draw 
the rest of us into a conspiracy to countenance the murder of other people's 
children.

ENVIRONMENTAL PURITY CAN COST TOO MUCH

<TEXT>
<P>
We're afraid that when this column appears, our neighbors, friends and even our 
children may stop talking to us. That's because we're about to confess our 
feeling that public opinion has gone overboard on environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
A national opinion survey that has been tracking public attitudes on pollution 
reported recently that almost 80% of Americans agree with the following 
statement: 'Protecting the environment is so important that requirements and 
standards cannot be too high, and continuing environmental improvements must be 
made regardless of cost.' 
</P>
<P>
We disagree. Some pollution should be tolerated in modern society, because the 
costs of eliminating pollution cannot and should not be disregarded. There are 
too many worthy social goals that must compete with protecting the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get us wrong. We hate pollution. We don't like the foul smells, the 
burning eyes, the sore throats and the damage to lakes and forests that 
pollution can bring. We are concerned about unsuspected health risks and we 
care about the environment in which our grandchildren will live. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are we opposed to government standards and requirements for industry. 
Controlling pollution is a proper role for government. Government regulation is 
needed when firms do not bear the full costs of their actions. A firm that 
pumps sulfur dioxide or other toxic compounds into the air or water does not 
bear the consequences. The costs and risks may be borne by individuals 
thousands of miles away who have no way to force the polluting firm to stop its 
practices or to compensate its victims for the damage they suffer. 
</P>
<P>
So we share the conviction that pollution should be reduced and that government 
has to guide that process. But we recognize also that reducing pollution is not 
cost-free. The more resources that are devoted to pollution reduction, the 
fewer are the resources that will be left over for other social goals including 
education, housing and improvements in public facilities of all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
When 80% of Americans support environmental improvements regardless of cost, 
many of the respondents must assume that someone else will be paying for those 
improvements. But, of course, the average American consumer and taxpayer will 
be the one to pay. That's true not just when the cost is in the form of higher 
taxes to pay for cleaning up the environment. It's just as true when the cost 
shows up in higher prices to consumers for electricity, cars or dry cleaning. 
The higher prices inevitably follow when firms face higher costs in order to 
meet higher environmental standards. 
</P>
<P>
These costs must be considered when policy-makers attempt to determine the 
right level for any type of pollution. An intelligent decision about the right 
level of pollution can be made only by balancing the effects of further 
pollution reduction on the environment and quality of life against the costs of 
those additional pollution reductions. The right level will rarely if ever be 
zero pollution. That's why we disagree with the survey respondents so strongly. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the emission of sulfur dioxide, the main cause of acid rain. About 20 
million tons of sulfur dioxide are released into the atmosphere over the United 
States each year, primarily by the burning of fossil fuels in electric power 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration recently presented a plan to reduce annual sulfur 
dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the year 2000. The reductions would 
come in two phases, with 5 million tons to be reduced during the first six 
years at an annual cost of $700 million. The second phase would extend to the 
year 2000 and would call for a further reduction of 5 million tons of sulfur 
dioxide plus 2 million tons of nitrogen oxide at a total annual cost of $3.8 
billion. While there are many reasons why the annual costs may not be exactly 
comparable, it is clear that the second phase would be much more expensive per 
unit of pollution reduction. 
</P>
<P>
If it costs even approximately five times as much to get the additional 7 
million tons of reduction, imagine how high those costs could reach to 
eliminate the remaining 10 million tons of sulfur dioxide from the environment. 
Remember that each additional ton reduced becomes more costly than the last 
one. 
</P>
<P>
The American voter should expect the Administration and Congress to be weighing 
the alternative uses of the billions of dollars that this program is going to 
cost. And policy-makers in Washington should inform the voters of the 
trade-offs that are involved. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that the entire Bush clean 
air program, when fully implemented, could cost $14 billion to $18 billion 
annually for industry to comply. That's OK as long as the American public feels 
that environmental protection is more important than other uses for those 
resources. The surveys show that the American public does support the 
environment, but let's hope that no one takes seriously the idea that the cost 
of environmental protection can be disregarded.

PLASTIC JUNKIES LEAVE THEIR MARK FOREVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEAL R. PEIRCE, Neal R. Peirce writes for the National Journal. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PORTLAND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A plastic foam beverage container to keep a cup of coffee warm five minutes is 
likely to last millennia. Increasingly we see polystyrene foam littering 
roadsides and shorelines and crowding our landfills. This stuff is cheap; it's 
light; it's forever." 
</P>
<P>
The author of this statement, Portland Commissioner Earl Blumenauer, is hardly 
alone in taking up the fight against disposal of nondegradable plastics into 
municipal landfills. From Long Island to Los Angeles, local officials have made 
plastics control a top item on their agendas. 
</P>
<P>
New York's Suffolk County, an anti-foam trailblazer, began in 1987 with a ban 
aimed at such dump-fillers as "clam shells," those styrofoam packages 
restaurants use to serve hamburgers, chicken and other fast foods. The ban was 
extended to any packaging that's not biodegradable. The plastics industry saw 
red, and a lawsuit has put off implementation. 
</P>
<P>
But reality is setting in: Suffolk must soon close several of its landfills. 
Says county legislator Steven Englebright: "The widespread use of plastics 
poses a threat tothe environment by causing rapid excess filling of landfill 
space, and, if we end up incinerating it, by the possible introduction of toxic 
by-products into the atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Without restraint on our part, the archaeologists of the 25th Century may find 
billions of tons of plastic wrappers, plates, cups, bottles, forks and 
disposable diapers -- all in mint condition. 
</P>
<P>
By weight, plastics represent just 7% of the 450,000 tons of waste generated in 
America each 24 hours. But measured by volume, they're a more ominous problem. 
By various estimates, plastics take 30% to 50% of landfill space. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the Minneapolis City Council unanimously declared that by July, 1990, 
all food-and-beverage packaging must be "environmentally acceptable"; it must 
be recyclable, returnable or degradable. St. Paul enacted nearly identical 
legislation in March. Foam egg cartons and trays, plastic ketchup or 
peanut-butter jars, plastic grocery bags, cups, trays, plates -- all will be 
illegal, whether they're made by local or national manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the Nebraska Legislature outlawed the sale of nonbiodegradable 
disposable diapers in 1993. Similar laws are being discussed in Oregon, Iowa 
and Washington. Environmentally acceptable parents will be those willing to 
revert to old-fashioned wrapping of babies' bottoms in cotton. 
</P>
<P>
There are stirrings of reform, even among plastic makers and users. McDonald's, 
said to throw off enough polystyrene foam waste in two weeks to fill the twin 
towers of New York's World Trade Center, led the fast-food industry to reject 
packaging made with chlorofluorocarbons. (CFCs help deplete the ozone layer 
that protects us from cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.) 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a consortium of big chemical and oil companies said they'd build 
five huge plastic recycling plants, eventually recycling 25% of the 725 million 
pounds of foam polystyrene manufactured yearly. The acknowledged goal is to 
defuse demands for polystyrene bans. 
</P>
<P>
There's also increasing talk of going to biodegradable plastics. The chemistry 
is simple: Add cornstarch to the resin, and bacterial action quickly breaks 
down plastic in a landfill. Italy, hardly an environmental leader, has decreed 
that all plastic packaging must be degradable by next year. American farm 
interests are salivating at the prospect of a vast new market for corn. 
Biodegradable plastics, however, mean dramatically increased cost. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are absolute plastic junkies. Our annual throwaway plastic soda, milk 
and water bottles would fill up a line of dump trucks reaching from New York to 
Cleveland, Time magazine estimates. Americans' per-capita trash output doubles 
that of affluent West Germany or Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But the proven dangers continue to mount. Commercial fishing fleets each year 
dump millions of pounds of packaging materials and vast quantitites of 
indestructible plastic fishing lines and nets. The victims: 1 million to 2 
million seabirds and 100,000 whales and seals, killed by intestinal blockages 
caused by plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
So what will induce our society to change our ways? 
</P>
<P>
One answer would be a sweeping national anti-plastics law. But waiting for the 
silver-bullet national solution, Earl Blumenauer argues, is simply unrealistic: 
</P>
<P>
"Congress and, increasingly, state legislatures are caught in political 
gridlock induced by special interests. The oil companies, the container firms 
hire their high-priced lobbyists. Things get studied to death or just beaten 
down." 
</P>
<P>
What's the alternative? Local governments engaged in grass-roots, hard-headed, 
educational cost-and-benefits debates about foam plastics, says Blumenauer. 
Thousands of local governments mean thousands of chances for action. Each local 
debate, grounded in the reality of overflowing waste dumps, should build a 
consensus on reducing waste and litter, creating state or national action. 
</P>
<P>
It's a great theory. Now all we have to do is see if it works.

TAKE MY WORD!: EXTOLLING THE PERIMETERS OF A PARAMETER

<P>
She is more to be pitied than censured; 
</P>
<P>
She is more to be helped than despised; 
</P>
<P>
She is only a lassie who ventured 
</P>
<P>
 Down life's thorny path ill-advised. 
</P>
<P>
Do not scorn her with words harsh and bitter; 
</P>
<P>
Do not laugh at her shame and downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, just stop and consider 
</P>
<P>
That a man was the cause of it all. 
</P>
<P>
I recalled that melodramatic old song while contemplating the pathetic picture 
of an innocent -- indeed, an immaculate -- word taken from sublime heights to a 
state of tattered ignominy among hoi polloi, simply by being embraced by 
ignorant lovers. Recently, I mentioned the word parameter, which has been 
misused to death in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
I said that, strictly speaking, parameter is an expression from 
crystallography, about which I know nothing. The first parameter definition in 
my Webster's New International, Third Edition, tells me that it is "the 
relative intercept made by a plane on a crystallographic axis, the ratio of the 
intercepts determining the position of the plane." 
</P>
<P>
I feel sure that there are many thousands of perfectly sane people who know 
exactly what that means, but I'm not one of them. The second definition is from 
mathematics, about which I know so little that I couldn't even begin to ask 
intelligent questions regarding what I don't know. I think my last brush with 
mathematics -- not counting checkbooks, taxes, and what-do-I-tip-on-this-tab -- 
was in high school algebra, circa 1942. The mathematical definition of 
parameter begins, "an arbitrary constant characterizing by each of its 
particular values some particular member of a system . . . " and I'm already 
way over my head. The succeeding definitions in WNI III are no more 
enlightening. 
</P>
<P>
My WNI III was published in 1966. It must have been sometime after that, 
probably during the Nixon years, when an anonymous member of the booboisie 
discovered parameter, thought it was a nifty, high-class, state-of-the-art way 
to say perimeter and took the word to dinner parties, to bed, and introduced it 
to all his friends, happily misusing it for his own pleasure and the 
titillation of his social circle. 
</P>
<P>
Its misuse achieved almost instant popularity and was accepted with 
overwhelming enthusiasm. It started appearing on talk shows and in political 
discourse, showing up in phrases such as the parameters of our current options, 
where it was completely out of place. Obviously, a lot of people who hadn't a 
clue as to its meaning thought it impressive enough to display in public, no 
matter what it meant. Anyway, it sounded a lot like perimeter, which we had all 
met in plane geometry in junior high. 
</P>
<P>
In my column, I implied that parameter had been stripped of its "legitimate" 
meaning, forgetting momentarily that language changes fairly constantly, so 
that illegitimate meanings often achieve legitimacy rather quickly, and that 
misuse through ignorance is one of the most common causes of change. It is the 
job of lexicographers to record the current usage of words and to reach a 
consensus on what the new meanings are. 
</P>
<P>
I got some mail on that column. I'd have welcomed mail from crystallographers 
or mathematicians who might have enlightened me, brushing away the shadows from 
my benighted state of not-knowing. Alas, my mail was entirely from people who 
missed my point. Not their fault, of course. What they had done was to go to 
their dictionaries and look up parameter. A perfectly sensible move. They found 
references to such notions as "a characteristic element or constant factor," 
"limit," and "boundary," none of which had any currency in 1966. I'll bet my 
entire Swiss bank account that their dictionaries were all published during the 
1970s or, more likely, the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
I turned to my most recently published dictionary -- the American Heritage, 
Second College Edition (1982). What I love about American Heritage is that it 
not only gives us the current definitions of words; it lets us have a peek at 
the seamy side of their history. Under parameter, it says, "Usage: This 
scientific term has been adapted to general usage. It is sometimes used in the 
sense of 'a constant, a given, or a precondition.' And sometimes in the sense 
of 'a limit or boundary' (perhaps influenced by perimeter): We must stay within 
the parameters of the present budget. They want to narrow the parameters of 
public debate. Violence and rebellion are parameters of modern life. None of 
these examples is acceptable to a majority of the Usage Panel." 
</P>
<P>
So this extraordinary word that had known only the lofty realms of 
crystallography and higher mathematics, where ignoramuses like me would be 
hopelessly lost, was, through no fault of its own, brought down to a tattered 
existence in the pedestrian world of common colloquy. Not only that; it is 
unacceptable to a majority of the Usage Panel. Crystallographers and 
mathematicians probably still use parameter in its original sense, but I 
suspect that they have some sense of regret, knowing that it has been sullied. 
I think, though, that it is more to be pitied than censured.

A CASTLE IN KENT; 
</P>
<P>
WHERE GUESTS LIVE RICHLY IN A FAIRY-TALE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
EDENBRIDGE, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the encroaching semidarkness, four stallions stood silhouetted against the 
red trails of sunset, huge black sentries keeping watch over the fields of 
Kent. 
</P>
<P>
As they lowered their heads to feed on mossy grass at the base of a sapling, a 
flock of swallows swooped overhead, lacing the thunderclouds together with an 
aviator's grace. 
</P>
<P>
The aroma of dusky, damp earth and wood smoke filled the air as we walked 
slowly through the forest on our way back to Hever Castle. The scrunching of 
our feet in the fallen copper-gold leaves was the only sound. 
</P>
<P>
Back at Hever, tea was waiting by the fireplace in a sitting room surrounded by 
mahogany. We rubbed our cold noses and quickened the pace. 
</P>
<P>
A vision of creamy china laid out by a roaring fire, plates laden with 
currant-studded scones and jam pots dripping with fresh raspberry preserves was 
suddenly too much. 
</P>
<P>
We broke into a jog, a light mist clinging to our faces like soft fabric. Our 
footfalls echoed as the woods seemed to open up. We raced the storm clouds, our 
spirits loose. 
</P>
<P>
Finally we spied Hever, deeply ensconced in the lush countryside. This 
fairy-tale setting was the childhood home of Anne Boleyn, providing Henry VIII 
with private chambers in which to woo his young bride. Their notorious love 
affair and subsequent marriage made Hever a focus for all England, at least 
until Henry had Boleyn beheaded. 
</P>
<P>
Through the centuries this small castle, which looks as if it were built of toy 
blocks by a child, passed through a succession of owners, eventually falling 
into obscurity and disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the seismically wealthy American, William Waldorf Astor. When William's 
father died in 1890, the son stepped into his handmade shoes as the richest man 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
Only 42 and rumored to have inherited more than $300 million, he was devoid of 
the usual Astor characteristics. He hated the business side of life and reveled 
in the arts. In 1891 he left the United States for good. 
</P>
<P>
Drawn to the elegance of Victorian England, he sensed Hever's innate charms and 
immediately bought the castle and surrounding 365 acres. Dubbed the 1st 
Viscount Hever, he quickly added to the castle's rich history with his 
flamboyant improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, the castle emerged refreshed and 
revitalized. The restoration reportedly cost $10 million, a staggering sum for 
that era. 
</P>
<P>
To create a lake big enough for boats, Astor changed the course of the River 
Eden, which flowed nearby. Workmen struggled for four years to clear 35 acres 
to build a deer park and a maniacal maze of slow-growing yew, which is still 
confoundingly lovely. 
</P>
<P>
Astor also had gardens constructed behind the lake similar to those at ancient 
Roman villas. Some English gardens, elaborate and detailed, are often austere 
and mathematical, easily understood. But much of Hever's Italian garden is 
inexplicably winsome and surprising. Sculptured hedges are tall enough to hide 
stolen kisses. Soaring cypresses stand guard over ancient busts and columns. 
</P>
<P>
Water cascades in a gallery of grottoes and ornate fountains, adding a rhythmic 
sensuality to this tranquil retreat. Although Astor was never thought of as a 
romantic, his garden seems to be a place wholly inspired by love. 
</P>
<P>
The main problem was that the castle was too small to accommodate Astor's 
weekend guests, among them Winston Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
To enlarge a 13th-Century moated fortress was an obvious impossibility, so he 
enlisted his architect, F. L. Pearson, to create a Tudor village of more than 
100 rooms on the far side of the moat. (In Boleyn's time, there was a similar 
village for servants on the other side of the castle.) 
</P>
<P>
Joined to the main structure of the fortress by a covered bridge, the new 
village was designed to give visitors the impression that each separate cottage 
had been designed by a different person. Inside the village, all quarters are 
joined by corridors and service areas. 
</P>
<P>
When viewed from high in the castle, every chimney stack in the village is 
distinct. Some roofs are tiled, some covered in slate. Each carved gable and 
leaded window splits the light with a different pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny internal courtyards and dormer windows add a "Wind in the Willows" touch. 
A labyrinth of white-tiled cellars under the whole village and castle hides 
miles of pipes, boilers, sewage disposal equipment, generators, a private water 
supply and a firefighting system. All are still in operation after more than 80 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Astor always had been fascinated by what he referred to as "the curious arts." 
His family believed that it was this interest in the supernatural that induced 
him to buy Hever. 
</P>
<P>
After Boleyn was beheaded, people claimed that her unhappy spirit wandered 
around the fortress. On windy nights, in an oak-paneled chamber where Henry had 
courted her, one could supposedly hear doleful love songs sung in a minor key. 
</P>
<P>
Astor invited the Psychical Research Society to investigate her ghost, keeping 
watch each night for several years during Christmas week, when it was believed 
that she was most likely to make her presence known. He was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
An avid host, Astor entertained many notables. His parties were somewhat 
unusual. The food and wines were outstanding, with dinners often of 14 or more 
courses. But he was paranoid about threats against his life, this fear of 
assassination said to be the fault of a drunken fortune teller he once 
consulted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern About Ghosts 
</P>
<P>
Probably the first owner to make use of the drawbridge over the moat in several 
hundred years, his concern with human intruders was far greater than his 
concern about ghosts. The bridge was pulled up each night, just as it had been 
in medieval times. 
</P>
<P>
His guests, tucked away in the Tudor village, were effectively cut off from 
their host. 
</P>
<P>
Astor had another peculiar obsession: punctuality. A careful schedule was often 
worked out for friends before their arrival, allotting them only so many hours 
for eating, riding, walking, driving, resting, dressing, letter writing and 
dancing. No deviation was tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
The story of one astonished guest shocked her friends for years afterward. It 
seems it was "reading time," but as she was not interested in burying her nose 
in a book, she strolled into the garden. 
</P>
<P>
An agitated servant asked her why she wasn't keeping to the schedule. When she 
grew indignant and asked to leave the castle, the embarrassed footman told her 
he wouldn't dare call for a carriage until the time set for leaving by Astor. 
</P>
<P>
But no rigid schedules exist for guests at Hever today. The Tudor village is a 
hotel-retreat for groups of 10 or more, housed in the same luxurious trappings 
of Astor's era. 
</P>
<P>
It's a wonderful feeling to open your eyes in the morning in an old-fashioned 
four-poster bed in a traditional English bedroom of scented wood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Country House Feeling 
</P>
<P>
Nests of doves murmuring beneath the windowsill are the first sounds you hear. 
Each of the 18 bedrooms, with private bath, is furnished in a different style, 
but the overall feeling is that of a magnificent country house. 
</P>
<P>
The ghosts of tenants past may glide noiselessly on slippered feet through the 
oak-paneled halls. On late winter afternoons, when rain beats against the 
windowpane, you hear the clip-clop of horses' hoofs on the cobbles outside. 
</P>
<P>
It is then that you may be aware of the ghost's presence, when your eyelids 
become heavy and half-closed in the dimming light. 
</P>
<P>
As we finished the last of the scones at 5 p.m., the clock on the mantle in the 
Tudor suite chimed. A young woman came in to light the lamps, leaving behind a 
scent of roses as she exited with the tea tray. 
</P>
<P>
Within the grounds, which are open to day-visitors only on weekends from April 
through October, overnight guests can indulge in clay-pigeon shooting, archery, 
fishing and horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous golf courses dot the surrounding countryside, and the castle has a 
heated swimming pool as well as tennis and squash courts. 
</P>
<P>
But the most intriguing pastime is simply exploring the castle. 
</P>
<P>
After tea we were given a private tour. Among the regal rooms, the library is 
irresistible, its carved ceiling a copy of one at Hampton Court. 
</P>
<P>
Walnut armchairs date from the reign of Charles II. Yet for all its museum-like 
masterpieces, it remains a cozy, seemingly familiar room, with plush rose sofas 
and fine British cabinetwork. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Book Carried to Death 
</P>
<P>
In the half-domed bedroom Boleyn occupied as a girl, the "Book of Hours" prayer 
book, which she carried to her execution on Tower Green, rests in a tiny glass 
case, inscribed in her handwriting: 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember me when you do pray 
</P>
<P>
 That hope doth lead from day to day." 
</P>
<P>
 The sad words followed us as we made our way down a 100-foot gallery. Running 
the length of the castle, the gallery was an essential part of any Tudor house, 
providing room for exercise in bad weather and a place for social gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
On his visits to Hever, Henry VIII held court seated in an end alcove. Long 
gold shafts of light blazed high in a stained-glass window bearing the royal 
coat of arms, the leaded panes becoming colorless with the fading day. 
</P>
<P>
You could spend weeks studying the priceless antiquities of Hever, treasures 
acquired with care, such as the huge leather and iron boots standing by the 
door to the library. 
</P>
<P>
Looking as if they belonged to a medieval Goliath, they were worn by postilions 
in the 17th Century to protect the leg that rested between two horses. 
</P>
<P>
The dining hall, with carved minstrel's gallery and open fire, is an ancient 
setting for a memorable feast, as is the Tudor village dining room, an 
intricately carved chamber. 
</P>
<P>
For special occasions, "Henry VIII Evenings" can be arranged, with a 
five-course Tudor banquet accompanied by traditional entertainers. If mayhem is 
more your style, try a "Murder Evening" or an Edwardian dinner. Hever 
accommodates only groups for overnight stays, so these theme parties can prove 
great fun. 
</P>
<P>
The regular dinner menus at the castle include typically British first courses, 
such as stuffed mushrooms with Stilton or a chef's superb homemade soup, and 
main courses of roast poussin with bacon rolls or breast of duck with black 
cherry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Various Pasta Dishes 
</P>
<P>
A vegetarian menu also is offered, featuring various pasta or egg dishes and 
home-grown vegetables with fresh herb butter. 
</P>
<P>
The subtle clack-clack of billiard balls drew us to the billiards room after 
dinner. As honey-colored brandy was poured from a cut-crystal decanter into 
hand-blown snifters, cigars were offered. 
</P>
<P>
A marble lighter flared up under the thumb of the butler, and the room was soon 
full of the masculine, smoky aroma of expensive tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
I could almost see old Waldorf himself through the haze, twirling his mustache 
in the shadows, nodding his approval. 
</P>
<P>

Hever Castle is 75 minutes from central London, with Gatwick Airport only 30 
minutes away. British Rail service goes from London's Victoria Station to Hever 
or Edenbridge. The castle is three miles southeast of Edenbridge, off the B2026 
road between Sevenoaks and East Grinstead. 
</P>
<P>
The nearby town of Tunbridge Wells is a good hunting ground for antiques and 
paintings. Other country manors to explore within a few miles of Hever include 
Chartwell, home of Winston Churchill, Penshurst Place and Scotney Castle 
gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The Brands Hatch motor circuit, where you can drive a racing car around the 
famous circuit, is only 50 minutes from Hever. Lingfield race course is about 
20 minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
Hever Castle will accommodate groups of 10 or more guests in the Tudor village 
(they will consider groups of eight). Maximum capacity is 33. Rates are 74.95 
(about $125 U.S.) per person, double occupancy, and 95.50 (about $160 U.S.) for 
a single. 
</P>
<P>
Prices include tax, service and a full English breakfast. All rooms have 
direct-dial phones, color TV and private bathrooms. Accommodations are 
available all year. 
</P>
<P>
Dinners average 19 (about $30 U.S.) to 35 (about $58 U.S.) per person. Hever

get away in conditions of great comfort and security. Management also will 
arrange wedding receptions and special parties. 
</P>
<P>
The castle and gardens are open to the public from April through October. In 
summer, the Kent Repertory Co. produces plays and concerts at the open-air

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: ON THESE PHONES YOU REALLY NEED AN AIR-EA CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago I was flying between San Juan, Puerto Rico, and New York City. The 
plane was scheduled to arrive at 5:20 p.m. I had planned to take a cab from 
Kennedy Airport to Manhattan, meet some friends and see a Broadway play that 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
But 20 minutes after boarding our flight, we were told by the pilot that there 
would be an additional 30-minute ground delay. Once in the air we were told 
that there would be another delay, this time due to air-traffic control. 
Instead of landing at 5:20, we would be landing at 7:20. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently there would have been no way to communicate to my friends that I 
had been delayed. But this plane was equipped with an airphone. 
</P>
<P>
I called my friends, explained my situation and told them to leave my ticket at 
the box office. I missed the first 10 minutes of the play, but that was all. 
</P>
<P>
In this case the airphone saved the day (or evening). And for many air 
travelers, it has become a way of life. They board their airplane, sit down in 
their seat and use the phone. 
</P>
<P>
It started Oct. 15, 1984, when airphones were activated on 12 aircraft operated 
by five major airlines. The phones were an immediate success. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, most of the airphones were used by people wanting simply to 
experience the novelty of the call. Thousands of airline passengers paid $7.50 
each per call for the first three minutes (and $1.25 for each additional 
minute) to phone family and friends to ask the same question: "Guess where I'm 
calling from?" Some longer conversations ensued. 
</P>
<P>
Then those folks got the bill, and from then on the phones were used strictly 
for business. 
</P>
<P>
The number of pay phones in the sky has soared. More than 1,100 aircraft flown 
by 16 domestic airlines and two international carriers are equipped with the 
phones. Passengers have placed more than five million calls. 
</P>
<P>
Some frequent fliers use the airphone almost without interruption on a 
coast-to-coast flight. (Phone bills of $300 or more are not unusual.) Even Pope 
John Paul II used the system, on Sept. 14, 1987, while flying between San 
Antonio and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The technology behind the airphone isn't new. The portable units are connected 
to a transponder that searches for one of the 72 ground stations spread out 
across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Once located, the call is sent via line-of-sight radio signal. The ground 
station dials the phone number and the call is connected. 
</P>
<P>
About the only major U.S. airline not to be equipped with the phones is USAir. 
</P>
<P>
One reason, said a USAir official, "is that the majority of our flights are 
very short." 
</P>
<P>
But market research studies show that length of flight has no bearing on the 
traveler who needs to use a phone. Just ask Midway Airlines. Most of its 
flights are also short, but the airline is installing a new version of the 
airphone, called the "seatfone." 
</P>
<P>
Midway recently announced that it would equip its entire fleet with the new 
seatback version of the airphone. Already more than 30 of the 41 jets in the 
Midway fleet have the system. The new version features a hard-wired handset in 
the center seatback of each row or, on the DC-9, in the window seatback of rows 
of two-abreast seats. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about the seatfone system is that you don't have to get up and 
get the phone," said David Hinson, Midway's chief executive officer. This can 
be a problem, what with beverage and food carts clogging aisles. There are 60 
seatfone units on each Midway aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
About the only problem with the airphone system is that the number of 
transponders has not increased. Thus, with that many phones on a plane, there 
is a good chance that outgoing lines may be busy. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas, British Airways is testing an airphone system that does not rely on 
ground stations. The British Airways "Skyphone," developed jointly with British 
Telecom and Racal Avionics, is the first satellite-based international flight 
telephone system. 
</P>
<P>
The system uses three over-ocean satellites (one positioned over the Atlantic, 
another over the Indian and a third over the Pacific) to give the airline 
worldwide coverage. The cost: $9.50 a minute. (British Telecom charges British 
Airways $6.70 a minute.) 
</P>
<P>
Passenger phone systems aren't limited to airlines. Most cruise ships are 
equipped with satellite communication systems, and the quality of the 
connection is quite good on both ends. 
</P>
<P>
If you're calling from a cruise ship, the radio room will place the call for 
you. If you're calling from land you just need to know the area code for your 
ship to be able to find it. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if the ship is in the Atlantic, Caribbean or Mediterranean, the 
area code is 871. In the Pacific it's 872 and in the Indian Ocean 873. (For a 
ship in the Atlantic, dial 871-555-1212 to get the direct number, then dial it 
yourself.) 
</P>
<P>
But one word of caution: Be prepared to pay for the service. It costs between 
$10 and $15 per minute to make a satellite call. 
</P>
<P>
Passenger phones can also be found on Amtrak's Metroliner Service operating 
between Washington, D.C., and New York City, and on Amtrak's service between 
Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The "railfone" service on these high-density business passenger trains has been 
a major success. Metroliner passengers average 3,000 calls per week, and the 
cost of a domestic call is quite reasonable: $1.50 per minute, with a $1.50 
access charge.

Hit a jackpot in Las Vegas. Tried the new limousine service from Los Angeles 
that was announced in Travel Tips June 4. It's a package deal ($179) that 
includes round-trip transportation plus three days/two nights at the new San 
Remo Hotel Casino &amp; Resort on Tropicana Avenue. Guests are picked up in 
stretch limousines that are equipped with TV sets, videos, bars. (They move 
like a cloud on the road to Nevada.) Winning Tours' limousines leave Los 
Angeles/Orange County daily (both morning and evening). Return trips at 1 p.m. 
or midnight. Night owls doze en route, reaching Los Angeles in time to go to 
work. The 332-room San Remo Hotel (next door to the Tropicana) features a 
lounge show, gourmet restaurant, casino, swimming pool. For value, this is a 
hard act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Contact Winning Tours, 6125 W. Sahara Ave., Suite 2B, Las Vegas 89102, or 
telephone toll-free (800) 657-5334. 
</P>
<P>
Budget Ideas 
</P>
<P>
If you're going to Las Vegas, get a copy of the Las Vegas Advisor. Publishes 
monthly. Tells where to get the best values for dining, entertainment (49-cent 
breakfasts, dinners for $2, shows for as little as $9.95). Readers are also 
told how to locate the hard-to-find penny slots. For a copy of the Las Vegas 
Advisor, send $1 to Huntington Press, Box 28041, Las Vegas, Nev. 89126. 
</P>
<P>
Idyllic New Zealand 
</P>
<P>
Idyll, the company that arranges for American travelers to stay in private 
chalets/apartments in Europe, has turned its attention to New Zealand. You can 
spend three weeks for as little as $11 a day per guest (based on four persons 
to an apartment) on either (or both) North Island or South Island. The price 
includes the assistance of a representative in New Zealand. All accommodations 
feature modern kitchens, living room, bedroom, bath. Linens/towels included. 
For brochures, write to Idyll Untours, P.O. Box 405, Media, Pa. 19063, or

<P>
Kiwi Skiing 
</P>
<P>
While the United States swelters, New Zealanders are enjoying the best ski 
season in several years. Heavy snow began falling in the Southern Alps in May. 
As a result, a number of ski areas opened early this year. Lots of action at 
Queenstown's Coronet Peak. Eight-to-15-day ski packages are being offered by a 
company called Skiing Kiwis in the Queenstown-Wanaka region. Beginners, 
intermediates, advanced. The Southern Alps takes in a territory bigger than the 
French, Italian and Swiss Alps combined. Heli-skiing on Tasman Glacier is high 
on the operator's priority list. For details, contact the New Zealand Tourist 
and Publicity Office, 10960 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1530, Los Angeles 90024, 
(213) 477-8241.

Caribbean Hideaway 
</P>
<P>
Drake's Anchorage Resort Inn in the Caribbean is a hideaway for all reasons: 
It's secluded (on a private island of only 126 acres), and the waters are 
picture post-card perfect for snorkelers. Drake's is in the British Virgins. A 
speck on the map. Totally divorced from civilization, with a restaurant that 
serves West Indian/continental cuisine. If you can afford to splurge, you can 
rent the entire island. For a day, a week, a month. Four beaches, a dozen 
ocean-front accommodations. The operator says Drake's is "where live 
entertainment is watching a humming bird sip nectar from a hibiscus or a 
pelican plunge into the sea." To get to Drake's you fly from San Juan, Puerto 
Rico, or St. Thomas to the island of Virgin Gorda. From there you take a short 
boat ride to Drake's. Rates: $155 a day single, $205 double, including 
breakfast, lunch, dinner. A seven-night honeymoon package figures out to $999, 
including the use of snorkeling, windsurfer and other water sports equipment.

Island Hideaway 
</P>
<P>
From Paul Betouliere of Topanga Canyon: "Twenty-five years ago I stayed at 
Deetjens Big Sur Inn at Big Sur, where I met the inn's guardian-caretaker, Ed 
Gardien. He created a warm and secure environment. Gardien is no longer at Big 
Sur Inn. He now operates a little inn on Kauai where he touches each person 
with that same magic care that made him so well-known at Big Sur Inn. I'm sure 
former guests at Big Sur would love to know where Ed Gardien has landed. Write 
to Gardien c/o Hanalei Bay Inn, P.O. Box 122, Hanalei, Kauai, Hawaii 96714."

HOW BEGUINES LIVED IN THE BEGINNING 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 12th Century, a wealthy Flemish priest named Lambert le Begue 
established a community in Liege for widows of crusaders. 
</P>
<P>
Called beguines, the women lived in a walled district referred to as a 
beguinage. They followed no rule except to do good works. 
</P>
<P>
A century later, one could find beguinages in nearly every town in Flanders, 
which included parts of the modern-day Netherlands, Belgium and France. 
</P>
<P>
Time stopped at the end of the Middle Ages for the beguinages. Scores of them 
survive in the Netherlands and Belgium as medieval enclaves in modern cities, 
offering a rare glimpse into the life of another age. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, women of all classes gained admission to the beguinages. Wealthy 
beguines took retinues of servants, but also subsidized poor beguines. 
</P>
<P>
The beguine devoted herself to practical works of charity by manual labor, 
teaching the children of burghers and caring for the sick. 
</P>
<P>
Beguines took no religious vows and always remained free to return to the world 
with their property. 
</P>
<P>
Some beguinages evolved into houses of religious orders, semi-convents 
occupying a position midway between monastic and lay status. 
</P>
<P>
Only a short walk from busy shopping streets, the beguinages now look much as 
they did 800 years ago: miniature houses and larger buildings grouped around a 
courtyard and walled off from the modern world. 
</P>
<P>
The beguine community contains a guest house, a church, an infirmary and the 
home of the head mistress. Frequent government subsidies ensure a firm 
financial foundation. 
</P>
<P>
In the Netherlands, where the Dutch refer to beguinages as begijnhofs or 
hofjes, the begijnhof in the heart of Amsterdam has been home to many since the 
14th Century. 
</P>
<P>
It's a block from Kalverstraat, the most crowded shopping street in the 
country. The begijnhof was rebuilt at city expense during the 17th and 18th 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Amsterdam begijnhof are elderly, widowed women or single 
Catholic women of scant means. They pay a nominal fee to remain residents. 
</P>
<P>
Holland's other begijnhofs, also publicly financed, provide housing for about 
4,000 elderly women. 
</P>
<P>
Although now a pastoral oasis, the begijnhof in Amsterdam acted as a religious 
battleground during the Reformation. After becoming Protestant, Holland 
converted the Roman Catholic church to a Protestant English Reformed church. 
</P>
<P>
A stained-glass window in that church depicts the departure in 1620 of John 
Robinson's separatists to Plymouth, where his followers joined other pilgrims 
intent on establishing a settlement in the New World. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years later, Catholics built a clandestine church in the begijnhof, but 
not before a lay sister named Cornelitgen Arents chose burial in a gutter 
rather than in the church that was no longer hers. 
</P>
<P>
The gravestone in the gutter might be pointed out to a visitor by a resident 
such as Lena Maria Zeldenthuis, who has lived in the begijnhof for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Auntie Helen, as she is called, might mention that no other begijnhof contains 
both a Catholic and a Protestant church, for Holland's other begijnhofs are 
either non-religious or wholly Protestant. 
</P>
<P>
She might reveal that only women joined the begijnhof because men would be 
unable to perform adequately the many household chores and would represent an 
added expense to benefactors. She might also tell of writing to American 
tourists who visit the begijnhof in the spring to admire the cherry blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to feel lonely here," Auntie Helen said, "and what is very 
important to me is that I am living in a community, but still have my 
independence." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Holland's begijnhofs, the beguinages in Belgium usually have a religious 
affiliation. In the medieval city of Bruges the beguinage houses Benedictine 
nuns, not beguines. Built in the middle of the 13th Century, the beguinage is a 
major tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
One enters by a bridge over a canal -- the Flemish name of the city, Brugge, 
means bridge. "Le grande dame," who lives near the main gate, will grant 
permission for house tours. 
</P>
<P>
In the 14th Century, the nuns of the beguinage rescued a vial said to contain a 
drop of Christ's blood from the Crucifixion. Brought back from the Second 
Crusade by Dierick of Alsace, the relic was tossed into the water for safety 
near the beguinage when Gent invaded Bruges during one of the many wars between 
the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
The relic remains on display every Friday throughout the year in the chapel 
known as the Basilica of the Holy Blood. 
</P>
<P>
In Gent, the historic capital of Flanders, beguines and nuns live and work 
together in three beguinages. Beguines in Belgium wear the old Flemish 
headdress and dark costume, so it is difficult to distinguish beguines from 
nuns. 
</P>
<P>
Gent's oldest and largest beguinage, St. Elisabeth's, is home to 1,000 
residents. A high wall isolates it as a preserve of peace and quiet in a modern 
industrial city. 
</P>
<P>
The city's other beguinages, the Klein and the Groot, are short streetcar rides 
from the center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The most notable beguinage in Belgium is in nearby Leuven, near Brussels. The 
wide lawns, narrow cobblestone streets and lacework of canals in the walled 
community have recently been given to the University of Leuven as a home for 
married students. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, beguinages prided themselves on diverse development, and the 
Leuven beguinage continues that flexible, albeit secular, tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Only groups of students' bicycles leaning here and there against stone walls 
give away the changed character of the beguinage's history. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than anachronisms, today's beguinages in Belgium and the Netherlands 
possess a medieval presence that makes the surrounding modern world seem askew 
and out of date. A beguinage does more than transport a visitor to a peaceful, 
captivating past. It conveys heritage. 
</P>
<P>
The spirit of life in a beguinage can be captured in the word deftigheid, which 
to Amsterdammers sums up the virtues of decorum, propriety and dignity -- the 
legacy bequeathed by Lambert le Begue.

AMISH CATER TO TOURISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC FRIEDHEIM, Friedheim is editor/publisher of Travel Agent magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: We are visiting Pennsylvania and would like to go to the Dutch area. 
Are tourists welcome? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Although the Amish and Mennonites stick to their old customs, they are 
courteous to strangers and many cater to tourists by selling quilts and other 
handicrafts. The Lancaster area has good accommodations and other interesting 
attractions. Contact the Pennsylvania Dutch Visitors Bureau, 501 Greenfield 
Road, Lancaster, Pa. 17601. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My baggage was lost on a recent charter flight, but the airline refused to 
provide compensation. Isn't that illegal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Unlike scheduled carriers, the charter operator isn't required to be 
responsible for damaged or lost baggage. This should be determined before 
boarding. Buying baggage insurance is wise before taking such flights. 
</P>
<P>
Q: There was no Bible in several of my hotel rooms. Aren't they required by 
law? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's no such law, but Gideon's International of Nashville, Tenn., puts a 
free copy in every hotel and motel room in 140 countries, and will replace worn 
or missing copies. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm interested in a 1990 spring training baseball tour package. What do they 
cost and how can I make a booking? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Various major league clubs, including the Dodgers, have "fantasy camps" 
providing up to a week of instruction and playing time with big leaguers. Ask 
your travel agent to contact teams of your choice for available dates. Prices 
range from $2,000 and up per person, including accommodations and most meals.

YOUTH BEAT: YMCAS OFFER SPECIAL PACKAGES IN SEVERAL CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Young travelers on tight budgets who prefer avoiding the restrictive hours and 
lack of privacy usually associated with youth hostels can investigate the 
YMCA's international network of budget lodgings. 
</P>
<P>
This year the association has added new, low-cost "do-it-yourself" tour 
packages for Washington, D.C., and a newly affiliated hotel in Bangkok, 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Details about accommodation prices and facilities at Ys in North America, 
Western Europe, the Far East and the South Pacific are available through a 
special "Ys Way" brochure produced by the YMCA of Greater New York. 
</P>
<P>
The 103 facilities listed include Ys and affiliated budget accommodations. Most 
provide lodgings for men and women at an average rate of $24 per person a night 
for single or twin rooms. 
</P>
<P>
One of the advantages of the "Ys Way" program is that you can reserve budget 
accommodations before you go. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the locations listed are YMCAs. In some areas the association has 
made arrangements to include suitable alternative lodging, such as hotels that 
cater to a young clientele. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Near Swiss Ski Areas 
</P>
<P>
In Switzerland, for example, the "Ys Way" program lists various S.S.R. Hotels 
operated by Switzerland's National Student Travel Service. Most are within easy 
reach of popular ski areas, and some offer accommodations during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
A recent addition to the international network is the Collins House 
International Y at 27 S. Sathorn Road in Bangkok. It offers 147 rooms at $25 
U.S. single or $30 twin a night. The hotel also has a fitness center, jogging 
track, swimming pool, restaurant, bar and massage room. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to accommodations, the program offers travel packages in New York 
City, New Orleans, Los Angeles (including Hollywood), Seattle and Washington, 
D.C. for independent travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Packages are two to five nights and include accommodations in single or twin 
rooms, breakfasts, several other meals and tickets for local tours. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smithsonian Museums 
</P>
<P>
The new Washington packages are from two to four nights and offer 
accommodations at the Hotel Harrington four blocks from the White House. It is 
also within walking distance of the free Smithsonian museums and just one block 
from the subway. 
</P>
<P>
A three-night program includes accommodations, three breakfasts, one dinner, a 
Washington-by-night tour (viewing Capitol Hill, the Kennedy Center and 
Georgetown) and a day tour that includes visits to the Library of Congress and 
the Supreme Court. Cost for a single is $175; for twin accommodations it's $155 
per person. 
</P>
<P>
The "Ys Way" program also operates a special student courtesy desk in the 
arrivals hall at Kennedy Airport in New York City. The staff provides 
transportation and reservation information for foreign visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Free copies of the "Ys Way" catalogue, which lists international facilities, 
youth travel services and reservation information, are available by contacting 
The Ys Way International, 359 West 34th St., New York 10001, or call (212) 
760-5869. Include a self-addressed, stamped (65 cents postage) envelope.

DINING OUT: SAMPLING THE TRADITIONAL CUISINE OF OLD MONTREAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LASLEY and ELIZABETH HARRYMAN, Lasley and Harryman are Beverly Hills 
free-lance writers.

MONTREAL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"When the early French settlers came to Canada they brought with them their 
French cooking techniques, but ingredients were scarce," said our friend 
Jacline Bergeron, a Montreal resident for 15 years and an authority on its 
cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to make do with what they had. That's how our French-Canadian food 
evolved." 
</P>
<P>
We were dining in the most traditional restaurant in Old Montreal, Les Filles 
du Roy, a 19th-Century house with walls of gray Quebec stone and beamed 
ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
It was not hard to imagine the setting when ships tied up on the nearby 
waterfront and merchants eagerly awaited the arrival of their merchandise. The 
waitress, in 17th-Century costume, brought us a tourtiere, a traditional meat 
pie. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1600s there was a bird in this country called the tourte," Bergeron 
said. "It's extinct now, and today a tourtiere is made with ground pork and 
beef, potatoes, onions and spices." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seasoned With Nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
We tried the meat pie and discovered a delicious mixture of ground beef, nicely 
seasoned with nutmeg and other spices and encased in a delicate pastry. Side 
dishes included fresh beets, velvet-smooth mashed potatoes, carrots and snow 
peas. A ketchup of tomatoes, onions, green peppers and vinegar, slightly 
sweetened with sugar, was a perfect accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Other traditional menu items were rich and hearty -- a pig's-knuckle stew, a 
huge slice of ham served in a maple syrup sauce and old-fashioned pork and 
beans. 
</P>
<P>
"The winters were very bitter," Bergeron said, "so a lot of the old dishes were 
heavy and substantial." 
</P>
<P>
Maple syrup was a discovery of the early settlers, and desserts at Les Filles 
du Roy are shamelessly sweet. One of them, maple syrup dip, is made with chunks 
of bread soaked in hot maple syrup and doused with heavy cream. 
</P>
<P>
Bread with maple sugar is simply a slice of bread covered in heavy cream and 
sprinkled with maple sugar. There's also maple syrup pie and even an egg 
poached in maple syrup. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opera Concerts 
</P>
<P>
While the food is heavy, it's also very good, and the atmosphere and service at 
Les Filles du Roy makes it one of our favorite restaurants in Old Montreal. The 
lucky tourist may happen on to a series of opera concerts on Friday evenings 
throughout the year. Entrees cost $12 to $15 Canadian (about $10-$13 U.S.). 
Starters and desserts are $3.25-$4.50 Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
Other restaurants in Old Montreal, the city's crowded quarter of restored 
buildings from the 19th Century and earlier, offer cuisine that is more 
typically French. La Mer a Boire, in a building that dates from the 17th 
Century, has the ambience of a French country cottage. 
</P>
<P>
We sat near the fireplace, which was flanked by firewood stacked nearly to the 
ceiling, and enjoyed a carrot soup spiced with nutmeg and a traditional French 
onion soup that was thick with onions and topped by cheese. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
St. Lawrence River 
</P>
<P>
For the main course we tried a fillet of dore, a white fish found in the St. 
Lawrence River. The dore had been sauteed with cucumbers. Fresh beets, 
sauerkraut and potatoes au gratin completed the course. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert was a light strawberry mousse served with a strawberry coulis and 
topped with whipped cream. At lunch you can order the suggestion du jour, which 
includes soup, main course, dessert and coffee for $9.25-$9.95 Canadian. In the 
evening, entrees are $10-$23. 
</P>
<P>
For breakfast or a light snack, visit La Maison Pierre du Calvet, a gourmet 
delicatessen in a building that dates from 1725. Sit at one of the tables set 
in front of the enormous old fireplace and have a cup of coffee and a 
croissant. Croissants are $1.20, and the shop also has an assortment of 
cheeses, breads and sausages. 
</P>
<P>
Our favorite dining experience in Old Montreal was an evening at La Maree. 
Thick stone walls, rich wood paneling and high-backed, brocaded chairs created 
an atmosphere of elegance and comfort in the 17th-Century house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fresh Lobster 
</P>
<P>
We began with a salad of arugula and chives with fresh lobster, scallops and 
shrimp sauteed in hazelnut oil and butter. 
</P>
<P>
Next came a poached halibut, served with two sauces, a rich 
butter-and-white-wine reduction and a light, slightly sweet sauce of sorrel and 
basil. Between courses a granita of black currants and red wine was served in 
sugar-rimmed glasses. 
</P>
<P>
For the main course we had thinly sliced roast breast of mallard duck served in 
a red wine sauce. It was served with carefully sculpted carrots, potatoes, 
zucchini and turnips. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert we chose a sampler plate that included pistachio cake, a chocolate 
cake with layers of dark chocolate mousse and Gran Marnier, a frozen pistachio 
mousse and a fresh passion fruit sorbet that evoked memories of the South 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended: Les Filles du Roy, 415 Bonsecours, (514) 849-3535; La Maison 
Pierre du Calvet, 401 Rue Bonsecours, (514) 282-1725; La Maree, 404 Place

TOURISM TRAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hats off to Peter S. Greenberg, who in his July 8 article, "How Tourism and the 
Environment Are Colliding," hinted at the self-contradictions of the tourism 
industry. The article makes clear that too much of a good thing isn't. Nowhere 
is this better illustrated than in the case of tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a vital part of the economy for both developing and industrialized 
countries. However, sometimes the country and visitors to it suffer as a result 
of too much promotion. The adverse impact of hypertourism withers the very 
essence of a destination. Today you have to search for romance in Venice, dig 
for resort-free sand in Hawaii. Even the off-season has been turned on by the 
traveling populace.

CHINA PROPAGANDA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The blood hasn't dried on Tian An Men Square and you already beat the drum for 
renewed tourist trade for China ("In Wake of Turmoil, China Still Holds 
Surprises," July 16). Elizabeth Mehren's thinly disguised propaganda is not far 
from disgusting. I know Guangzhou, which is, to put it mildly, an unremarkable 
city. What's the hurry to invite Americans and their dollars back to visit that 
or any other part of China?

NAME CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The name Michoacan ("Exploring Michoacan, Mexico's 'Land of Lakes,' "July 9) 
does not mean "land of lakes" in the Tarascan "dialect." Michoacan is a 
Hispanicized version of the Nahuatl (Aztec) "Michuacan," meaning "land of the 
fishermen" or "land of those who fish." Furthermore, Tarascan is not a dialect; 
a dialect derives from another language. Tarascan, or Purepecha, as it is 
called properly, is a language unto itself. "Tarascan" is a Nahuatl word and 
not indigenous to the Michoacan area. Its meaning and origin are obscure.

I have just come back from a long trip to New York City, England and France. 
Thank goodness my office saved all the back issues of the Sunday Los Angeles 
Times. I have just read and re-read Jerry Hulse's pieces on Bora Bora (May 14) 
and Raiatea (May 21). They are some of the best stuff I have ever read and I 
have saved them, not only to refer to for my readers but as a source of 
inspiration. Thank you for your beautiful series.

Between now and 1992, more than 20,000 hotel rooms will be added to the 61,000 
existing rooms, hotel owners and industry analysts say, and about 7,000 of 
those will be in two hotels. 
</P>
<P>
One is the $630-million Mirage, being built by Golden Nugget Inc., which will 
have 3,100 rooms when it opens Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The other is the $290-million Excalibur, a project of Circus Circus 
Enterprises. It will have 4,032 rooms, the most of any hotel in the country 
when it opens in June. 
</P>
<P>
"Las Vegas is experiencing the greatest growth phase of its history," said Saul 
F. Leonard, a gaming industries expert with Laventhol &amp; Horwath, Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mirage and Excalibur will be the first new major projects in the city in 
15 years, and with their unusual features, they will be must-sees." 
</P>
<P>
The president of The Mirage, Bobby Baldwin, said most of his hotel's features 
were "a secret of sorts," but earlier reports indicate that it will have a 
$9-million lagoon, a 49-foot waterfall and a 100-foot-high, sky-lit atrium 
filled with 70-foot-high banyan trees, coconut palms and tropical orchids. 
</P>
<P>
Excalibur will feature a medieval theme, with a moving walkway that will carry 
visitors over a moat and through castle gates to a casino, an amphitheater, 
shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Mirage and Excalibur are being built on "The Strip." But Fletch 
Brunelle, research coordinator for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors 
Authority, said that there are hotel construction projects under way all over 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that about 11,500 hotel rooms are being built, and 38,000 more are 
proposed, some of which will be completed after the 20,000 planned to be 
available by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the new rooms are being added to existing hotels, which are also 
expanding their casinos and convention halls, Leonard added. 
</P>
<P>
The construction boom was created, experts say, by an aggressive marketing 
strategy used in the past few years by the state, the city's Convention 
Authority and the major hotels to capture conventions, trade shows and group 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strategy Is Working 
</P>
<P>
The strategy is apparently working. 
</P>
<P>
"Las Vegas is the third largest convention city in the United States and 
probably will be No. 2 within the next two years," Leonard said. (Experts agree 
that New York is No. 1, but they're split, between Chicago and Atlanta as to 
which city is No. 2.) 
</P>
<P>
"Nevada, especially Las Vegas, is already one of the top destinations for group 
tours coming from Asia," said Rich Moreno, state director of tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Since an office to stimulate Japanese travel to Nevada was established in Tokyo 
three years ago, the number of Japanese tourists visiting the state jumped from 
165,000 to 300,000, he added. And he expects the number of all Asian visitors 
to grow after a Taipei office is opened in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tours from Europe 
</P>
<P>
The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority hopes to make the city a top 
destination for tours from Europe as well. "It's in our budget to help fund an 
office in London or Frankfurt," said Frank Sain, the bureau's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau's advertising budget for the next fiscal year is about $10 million, 
and that will be spent on ads in newspapers, magazines, billboards, and TV and 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California is our primary market," Sain said, estimating that 
Californians represent up to 42% of all Las Vegas visitors, which jumped from 
11.7 million to 17.2 million in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the California visitors come from Southern California, said 
Maurice Robinson, a senior manager with KPMG Peat Marwick, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The proximity of Southern California to Las Vegas undoubtedly contributes to 
the fact that the growth in Nevada, in terms of casino revenues and visitors, 
is "overwhelmingly in Clark County," said Andy Grose, executive director of the 
state's Economic Development Commission. "(It) is not a statewide phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laughlin a Boom Town 
</P>
<P>
"If you really want to see a boom town, though, you should go to Laughlin," 
Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
Laughlin, also in Clark County but a little closer than Las Vegas to Los 
Angeles, had 430 hotel rooms in 1981 but slightly more than 4,000 at the end of 
1988, he noted, and it is expected to have about 13,000 at the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Laughlin drew some business from downtown Las Vegas, he said, but owners of the 
downtown Las Vegas hotels and casinos have changed their marketing strategy to 
capture richer customers. 
</P>
<P>
They switched, said Jim Needham of Arthur Young in Seattle, from courting 
"blue-collar workers and moms and pops carrying around milkshake containers of 
nickels to younger people looking for a one-stop place for a show, gambling and 
resort." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeking Conventions 
</P>
<P>
Hotel/casino owners throughout Las Vegas responded the same way to business 
setbacks in 1979, when casinos first opened in Atlantic City, N.J., and in the 
early '80s, when there was an economic recession. 
</P>
<P>
They changed their marketing strategy by seeking conventions and those visitors 
who would stay longer than a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Las Vegas saw what it had to do," said Dave Daley, a partner in the Arthur 
Andersen Real Estate Services Group. 
</P>
<P>
"Las Vegas turned from a weekend regional, getaway place where people would 
drive to go, to a national convention place competitive with such cities as San 
Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles," said Robinson of KPMG Peat Marwick. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Atlantic City's 30 million annual visitors do not stay overnight, 
observed Sean Hennessey, a vice president of Landauer Associates, New York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pull from the Midwest 
</P>
<P>
"And I'd say that Las Vegas still enjoys a tremendous pull from the Midwestern 
states and even from Buffalo and areas approximate to Atlantic City, which is 
still trying to get better airport and convention facilities to emulate Las 
Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
But Las Vegas is still improving its airport and convention facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Although the first of a three-phased, $1-billion expansion of McCarran 
International Airport in Las Vegas was completed a few years ago, the second 
phase is under way, and the city has just launched a $35-million expansion of 
its convention center. 
</P>
<P>
Many hotels are also adding convention accommodations, including the Sands, 
where a 1-million-square-foot convention center, touted as "the largest outside 
a facility operated by a community," is expected to be completed in 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
New sites are also coming up for future gaming, convention and hotel 
development. The largest in the city is a 300-acre site owned by the Union 
Pacific Railroad, which is being marketed by Cushman Realty, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of the city's drive to stay on top of the competition, including 
state lotteries, which, gaming experts say, have helped the casinos at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"Lotteries have made gaming more acceptable, a mainstream activity," said 
Landauer's Hennessey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Experiences Planned 
</P>
<P>
But Las Vegas is banking on more than its current gaming and convention 
capabilities to draw visitors and fill hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
New games and experiences and a proposed train are in the cards. Said John 
O'Reilly, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission: "I think that in the next 
12 to 24 months, there will be some new games with more universal appeal than 
most games of the past." 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas is also betting on what state tourism director Moreno describes as 
"new experiences," like the live dolphins that will perform at the Mirage and 
jousting tournaments that will be held at Excalibur. 
</P>
<P>
"People won't just go to a hotel as a place to stay but as an experience," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas is also betting on a super-speed train, which would make the trip 
from downtown Las Vegas to downtown Los Angeles in an hour -- for $65, round 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
"I want it to happen," said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of 
the 16-member California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Committee. 
"We'll know in a year if it's financially and environmentally possible." 
</P>
<P>
The train would be privately funded at a cost of $3.5 billion, he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Race is On 
</P>
<P>
Despite the price, Arnie Adamsen, a Las Vegas city councilman and vice chairman 
of the commission, said, "It could conceivably start construction in 1993 and 
be on line from 1996 to 1998." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the race is on to see which hotel will have the most rooms to 
attract the largest conventions. 
</P>
<P>
For some time, the 3,174-room Las Vegas Hilton has been billed as "the largest 
hotel in the free world." It will be overshadowed by the Flamingo Hilton after 
a 750-room expansion there brings the Flamingo's room count to 3,650 in early 
1990, but Excalibur will be the biggest when it opens in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
A 1,700-room, 42-story tower, which is being called "the tallest in the state," 
is expected to bring the Riviera Hotel's room count to about 4,000 in late 1991 
or 1992. And a 1,500-room tower to be completed in 20 months at the Sands will 
bring that hotel's room total to nearly 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
The number of rooms under construction is a lot in a short period of time, 
experts agree, but most are optimistic that occupancy rates will remain high 
after a slight downturn. A glut of hotel rooms will exist, said Leonard, but 
only temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Occupancy Rates 85% 
</P>
<P>
Current occupancy rates are in the 85% range in Las Vegas, while occupancies 
range between 65% and 70% for hotels in the rest of the country, according to 
Hennessey. 
</P>
<P>
"What's dropping is motel occupancy," said Sain, of the Convention Authority. 
</P>
<P>
It's still at a respectable 73%, he noted, "but they're not getting the hotel 
overflow. In the eight years I've been here, not that many new motels have been 
built because most convention and trade show people want hotels with all their 
amenities." 
</P>
<P>
In the long-range, predicted Leonard, Las Vegas will continue to grow "because 
there is so much happening there. 
</P>
<P>
"And when you consider that only about 10% of the people in the United States 
have ever been to Las Vegas, you know that the city has a hell of a long way to 
grow." 
</P>
<P>

SOFTENING THE JOLT OF 'THE BIG ONE'; 
</P>
<P>
USC HOSPITAL WILL BE FIRST IN U.S. TO USE BEARINGS DESIGNED TO LESSEN SEISMIC 
SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When an earthquake measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale rumbled through the 
Southland on Feb. 9, 1971, it took its deadliest toll at two hospitals in 
Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-six people died when two buildings at the Veterans Hospital crashed in a 
pile of rubble, and two more were killed when a pair of buildings collapsed at 
Olive View Hospital nearby. 
</P>
<P>
But if a high-tech "seismic isolation system" being installed underneath a new 
hospital at the USC Health Sciences campus east of downtown Los Angeles lives 
up to expectations, the building will be one of the safest places in town if -- 
or when -- the widely expected "big one" hits the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
The seismic isolation system consists of 149 specially designed rectangular 
bearings. The new medical facility is believed to be the first hospital in the 
United States to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Although small -- about two feet on a side and one foot high -- each bearing 
weighs about 1,000 pounds and costs about $5,000. Most of them have a lead core 
wrapped with alternating layers of rubber and steel. 
</P>
<P>
The bearings sit on the concrete-and-steel foundation of the hospital and will 
be topped by steel columns that will support the building when it is completed 
in 1991. Each bearing is designed to support 1 million pounds. 
</P>
<P>
When an earthquake comes, the bearings will sway back and forth as they -- not 
the building itself -- absorb and then dissipate most of the energy from the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital will sway, too, but only very little because the bearings 
underneath will soak up most of the quake's force. 
</P>
<P>
"The bearings act like 'seismic shock absorbers,' absorbing the energy that 
would otherwise travel into the building and cause damage," said Stephen M. 
Weissberg of Dynamic Isolation Systems Inc., the Berkeley-based firm that 
designed the system for the hospital and a dozen other structures across the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these "shock absorbers," Weissberg said, the building will respond to 
an earthquake measuring a whopping 8.0 on the Richter scale as if it were a 
moderate 5.5 shaker. 
</P>
<P>
The isolation system is designed to solve a problem that has vexed architects, 
engineers and other construction professionals for decades: How to make 
buildings with fewer than a dozen or so floors better able to handle quakes and 
minimize damage. 
</P>
<P>
Modern skyscrapers usually don't get badly damaged during quakes because their 
sheer height makes them more flexible and better able to "throw off" 
quake-generated energy. 
</P>
<P>
Buildings in the 3- to 12-story range usually don't fare as well, Weissberg 
said, because they aren't tall enough to fully dissipate the energy. Instead, 
they remain rigid as they try to absorb the quake's power and -- as was the 
case with the VA and Olive View hospitals in the '71 quake -- the shaking that 
results can cause huge amounts of damage. 
</P>
<P>
Because the bearings soak up most of a quake's force, a seismic isolation 
system "makes short buildings act like tall ones," Weissberg said. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the bearings that will be used at the new hospital have 
already been installed. The rest are expected to be in place within the next 30 
days, said Arthur Stephenson, a construction inspector for National Medical 
Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
NME will own and operate the 275-bed hospital, near County/USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of seismic isolation isn't new. In fact, a British doctor began 
toying with the idea in the early 1900s. But it took the creation of complex 
computer programs and other earthquake-testing tools to make the construction 
of the systems possible. 
</P>
<P>
About 125 buildings in the world have seismic isolation systems similar to the 
one being installed at the new hospital, but most of those structures are in 
the quake-prone countries of Japan and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Structural Damage 
</P>
<P>
Although the systems have been laboratory-tested to see how they would perform 
in quakes rated as high as 8.0 on the Richter scale, the highest real-life 
quake withstood by one of the buildings registered about 6.5 on the Richter. 
Weissberg said that building, in Japan, suffered no structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
Another 20 of the structures have experienced "moderate" quakes in the 5.0 to 
6.0 range, he said, and all of them received little or no damage. 
</P>
<P>
The only other Southland building believed to have a similar system is the 
four-story Foothill Communities Law and Justice Center in Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Southland buildings, however, will install seismic-isolation systems 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
One is the new emergency dispatch and command center that the county is 
building in East Los Angeles. The structure will serve as the "nerve center" 
for fire-fighting, rescue and other efforts in the event of a major 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supercomputers 
</P>
<P>
The second is a 20-year-old building in Seal Beach that is owned by Rockwell 
International. The building houses supercomputers that, if damaged by a large 
quake, could seriously disrupt the defense contractor's operations. 
</P>
<P>
National Medical Enterprises also plans to use isolation systems in several 
future hospital projects. 
</P>
<P>
"The system only adds about 2% to our overall construction costs, because the 
isolation system allows us to use less reinforcing steel in the rest of the 
building," said Sherwin E. Small, an NME executive. "An extra 2% is a cheap 
insurance policy against a big earthquake."

RODEO DRIVE TO GET EURO-STYLE STREET OF SHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVELYN De WOLFE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Rodeo Drive, the largest retail development ever built on the 
internationally famous shopping street, celebrated its topping off Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The $130-million, 26-building shopping complex, occupying a full block at the 
northeast corner of Rodeo Drive and Wilshire Boulevard, has its own private 
street and will increase the retail square footage along Rodeo Drive by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Two Rodeo is a joint venture of AMEC-Power-Malkin Partners, which recently 
acquired the Ambassador Hotel site on Wilshire Boulevard; Stitzel Properties 
Inc., developer of One Rodeo in Beverly Hills, One Union Square in San 
Francisco and One Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, and Berisford Rodeo Property 
Development, a subsidiary of Berisford International PLC of the United Kingdom, 
which joint-ventured with Stitzel Properties on numerous projects. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas L. Stitzel, president of the Stitzel Co. and the project's development 
director, specializes in the development of high-end retail projects. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes his Beverly Hills project will capture some of the special 
allure of time-honored European shopping districts such as Via Condotti in Rome 
and Bond Street in London. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to bring to Two Rodeo the same welcoming ambience," he said, adding 
that one of the special features of the project is its street plan, which 
doubles the amount of valuable ground-level retail shopping space. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concept was to create two ground floors through the utilization of a 
9-foot grade change from Dayton Way and Rodeo Drive to Wilshire Boulevard," 
Stitzel noted. 
</P>
<P>
"By manipulating the floor plan levels, we were able to arrive at a unique 
rhythm of contrasting buildings on a curving street, to be named Via Rodeo, 
each having a different tactile architectural element such as terra cotta, 
limestone, brick and plaster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Individual Identity 
</P>
<P>
"The building shapes will vary considerably, some will have balconies, others 
colonnades or awnings that will give individual merchants their own identity," 
Stitzel said. 
</P>
<P>
"Store fronts will be further customized to suit the clients' products and show 
windows will be not more than 18 inches from the ground to relate more closely 
to the pedestrian viewpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Stitzel commissioned Italian artists to create special features for Via Rodeo, 
which includes street lights, limestone sidewalks, an elevator tower and two 
restaurants, including a sidewalk cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Scott, director of environmental services for the city of Beverly Hills, 
said the project received close scrutiny before its final, enthusiastic 
approval by the city's Architectural Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"It involved a prime site previously owned by Amercan Savings &amp; Loan that 
has been the subject of considerable controversy in recent years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"First there was the issue about a hotel proposed by the Four Seasons chain 
that was turned down by Beverly Hills voters." 
</P>
<P>
Later a group of investors negotiating for the site stirred renewed 
controversy, Scott said. The project met with considerable public resistance 
and was also considered by the city to be too minor for such a prime location. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal of Stitzel's proposal for Two Rodeo was twofold, Scott noted. 
</P>
<P>
"The developer, in this case, had a good track record and showed us a project 
that lived up to the Rodeo Drive image -- also one that was economically sound 
and architecturally creative." 
</P>
<P>
Stitzel satisfied the city's business and governmental leaders with a proposal 
that provided 132 additional parking spaces above the code requirements (one 
space for every 350 square feet of retail space), besides its valet parking 
service convenience. 
</P>
<P>
The city granted Stitzel an encroachment under the Rodeo Drive sidewalk to make 
the additional parking spaces possible, a concession that will benefit both the 
developer and the city, since all 600 of Two Rodeo's parking spaces will be 
available to the public on the same two-hour free-parking basis currently 
provided by the city, for the life of the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tiffany to Relocate 
</P>
<P>
Leases at Two Rodeo are from 10 to 20 years and vary from $75 per square foot 
annually for large spaces to $200 per square foot annually for 300-foot spaces. 
"This . . . has made (anchor stores) more affordable," Stitzel said. 
</P>
<P>
The prestigious Tiffany &amp; Co. of New York will relocate from its longtime 
corner location in the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel to its own building across 
the street in Two Rodeo shopping complex. 
</P>
<P>
The 17,000-square-foot Tiffany building was designed for the tenant by Brand 
Allen, a consulting architect for the project, and it is the largest business 
location outside Manhattan for Tiffany. 
</P>
<P>
Cole-Haan is also a tenant, and a new Giorgio is expected on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The architect of record on the project is Kaplan McLaughlin Diaz, based in San 
Francisco. Peck/Jones, Los Angeles, is the general contractor.

<P>
When a New York friend of a Los Angeles screenwriter came to visit, the 
cabdriver who picked him up at Los Angeles International Airport didn't want to 
know where the New Yorker was going. 
</P>
<P>
Instead the cabbie said, "Tell me what your friend does for a living and I'll 
tell you where he lives." "OK," said the New Yorker, a little put out by the 
cabdriver's conceit. "He's a screenwriter." 
</P>
<P>
"Ah," said the cabbie as he started driving out of the airport. "He must live 
in the Hollywood Hills." Startled, the New Yorker said: "That's right! How did 
you know?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it's a high-percentage call," the cabbie chuckled. "Those hills are full 
of artists and writers." 
</P>
<P>
The cabdriver was exaggerating, of course, but only a little. Since the turn of 
the century, the hills of Hollywood have provided a conducive working 
environment for all sorts of creative types. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steep, Tortuous Roads 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Hollywood Hills still provide refuge for a substantial arts colony 
as well as for the hundreds of others who live on its often steep, tortuous 
roads. Refuge from the crazy streets of Hollywood, refuge from crowded 
freeways, refuge from tract-home living. 
</P>
<P>
Refuge that carries a price. Last year's boom that inflated housing prices 
throughout the city raised the median price of a typical 1920s 2-bedroom, 
Spanish-style house in the Hills to $500,000. The same house in Hollywood's 
flatlands would cost some $300,000 less. Current multiple listings for the area 
shows a range from $243,500 for an 834-square-foot two-bedroom, one-bath house 
to $4.5 million for a six-bedroom, six-bath mansion on a hilltop 3 1/2-acre 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Husband and wife Patrick Walshe and Ros Mason-Jones found refuge at a 
"reasonable" price. The British couple -- he's an artist, she's a clothing 
designer -- moved to Los Angeles in 1986 from New York, buying a condominium in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided we wanted a house, but couldn't afford anything in Santa Monica, so 
we started going across the city, eliminating areas," Walshe, 36, said. "We 
came across the Whitley-Camrose area by chance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The High Tower 
</P>
<P>
Walshe and Mason-Jones had stumbled into one of the many pocket areas that give 
the Hills their charm. Located just south of the Hollywood Bowl, the 
Whitley-Camrose area -- better known as Whitley Heights -- was planned in the 
early 1920s by H. J. Whitley, a man infatuated with European architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood is best known for the High Tower, a whimsical five-story shaft 
with elevator that rises from the end of Hightower Drive and is modeled after 
structures in Bologna, Italy. Silent screen heartthrob Rudolph Valentino lived 
there on Wedgewood Place with his second wife, Natacha Rambova. 
</P>
<P>
Walshe and Mason-Jones purchased a two-bedroom, two-bath house for $360,000. 
The Italian-style house was built in 1922 and "consistently improved." They 
have just completed "major renovation on the downstairs" and expect to begin 
work on the upstairs soon. 
</P>
<P>
One of Walshe's pleasures is in the "great variety in the Hills. If you took a 
photograph of this street, it wouldn't say 'California' -- it looks like 
Italy." 
</P>
<P>
Grace Baldwin, a neighbor of Walshe and Mason-Jones, was also drawn to the 
European look of the area. "It reminded me of the Italian Riviera," the caterer 
and gift-shop owner said. "There's a Mediterranean feeling, a little mix of 
different countries." 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin bought her house 13 years ago, after living in the Hills since 1960. 
Built the same year as the Walshe/Mason-Jones house, Baldwin describes it as a 
"typical Whitley house of Italian/Spanish stucco with greenhouse windows and 
French country kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
She entertains a lot in the two-bedroom, one-bath 1,500-square-foot house and 
loves the "very neighborly feel to the area -- people are really friendly." 
</P>
<P>
Elias and Sharon Davis are also Hills old-timers. The couple, in their late 
40s, raised their two children in the Spanish-style Hollywoodland area house 
they purchased in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
(Hollywoodland may be the most famous of the Hollywood Hills communities. Built 
on the lower slopes of Mt. Lee, the subdivision was advertised by the famous 
Hollywood Sign, originally reading Hollywoodland). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charm in the Design 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only house we've ever owned," said Elias Davis, a television writer 
and producer. "There is a lot of charm in the house's design" -- a roomy 
three-bedroom, four-bath with 3,600 square feet of living space. 
</P>
<P>
The Davises once "talked about moving to Studio City or some other area in the 
flats, so the kids could walk to stores and maybe have more kids to play with 
-- there was a lot of car-pooling from the Hills, a lot of work," Elias Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is a removed kind of feeling here -- isolated yet close -- and a 
great view of the canyon. There's something about having deer to look at from 
your windows." 
</P>
<P>
The Davises decided the commute (to the studios for Elias; to UCLA for Sharon, 
a foreign student adviser) was worth the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
A commute of one sort or another is almost guaranteed for Hills dwellers. There 
are few stores or restaurants in the area proper. Most shopping trips are into 
neighboring communities, with Glendale or the Valley preferred over the 
congestion of Hollywood's flatlands. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the commute to take the children to school. But, says Ira Sanders 
of Fred Sands Realty in Los Feliz, an office that handles many Hollywood Hills 
listings, "schools are not as important a factor for most residents; the area's 
other attributes come first. Also, there are not as many families drawn to the 
area to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Another pair of Hills old-timers as well as artists, Yoram and Peggy Kahane 
moved to their Hollywood Hills hideaway in 1967, according to Yoram, for "three 
reasons: to be near work, to live in an old Hollywood neighborhood of 
Spanish-style houses and to be near nature." 
</P>
<P>
The Kahanes -- Yoram a 1959 immigrant from Israel, Peggy from Chicago -- who 
own the Shooting Star photographic agency in Los Angeles, found all three, 
after Yoram Kahane talked to six real estate agents. 
</P>
<P>
"The one who took me seriously sold me this house on a cul-de-sac," he said, a 
3,000-square-foot, three-bedroom late '20s gem with arches, tile and wrought 
iron spread out over three levels. The 1967 price: $42,000. 
</P>
<P>
One problem with the Hollywood Hills is that the precise boundaries are a 
little hard to pin down, partly the result of real estate agents and home 
sellers anxious to cash in on the area's cache. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce draws the community map from Griffith Park on 
the east extending to Laurel Canyon on the west, from Mulholland Drive on the 
north to Franklin Avenue on the south. 
</P>
<P>
This area includes most of the Hollywood Hills landmarks, particularly the 
valuable collection of architecturally interesting works, ranging from public 
areas like the Hollywood Bowl (with its notable Federal Arts Project gate on 
Highland Avenue) and the Yamashiro restaurant (a Japanese mountain palace with 
600-year-old pagoda at 1999 N. Sycamore) to such private architectural gems as 
R. M. Schindler's Fitzpatrick House (8078 Woodrow Wilson Drive) and John 
Lautner's 1960 Malin House (776 Torreyson Drive), better known as the 
"Chemosphere," which is anchored on a pedestal riveted to the hillside and 
which gives off the appearance of being a flying saucer. 
</P>
<P>
All of which is part of the Hills' appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Hill-dwellers in general are different from those looking for housing in more 
'conforming' areas," said Sanders of Fred Sands Realty. "They are concerned 
about privacy, a natural setting. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"The artists in particular -- many of them in the writing arts, or 
behind-the-scenes crafts people in the film industry -- are attracted to the 
Hills," said Sanders' co-worker Norm MacNeil. "They have a great appreciation 
for the variety of the architecture, for the integrity of the homes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are really energetic, people who in their daily lives are really 
'burning' it and need to get away from the rat race. The Hills are perfect for 
that."

WOMEN NEED MORE HAVENS, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Over a period of six months, Mary mustered enough nerve to call four battered 
women's shelters seeking refuge from her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Each time, she was told there was no room and she became increasingly 
discouraged and fearful, she said. And each time, she gave up trying until she 
was hurt again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like if somebody calls the police while someone is breaking the door in 
and you're told 'sorry not now, can you call back later?' " she said. "You just 
want to be safe and you have nowhere else to turn." 
</P>
<P>
The La Verne resident (she asked that her last name be withheld) was finally 
accepted to the House of Ruth in the East San Gabriel Valley, one of three 
shelters for victims of domestic violence in the valley. By then her husband of 
more than four years had broken her collarbone and threatened to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of the battered women and children who seek shelter in Los 
Angeles County cannot be accommodated, according to a county grand jury report 
released this month. The approximately 400 beds in 18 private nonprofit 
shelters countywide are inadequate, the study stated. Only about 150 families 
can be accommodated at one time. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had adequate numbers of shelters, half the country would be safehouses," 
said Jamie Watson, board member of the Southern California Coalition on 
Battered Women. 
</P>
<P>
According to the grand jury report, violence has erupted at least once between 
more than half the couples in the nation, and abuse is common to between 10 and 
25 percent of all couples. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, nearly 40,000 domestic violence-related calls for 
assistance were made in 1987, city and county authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liaisons With Shelters 
</P>
<P>
No county programs target battered women, the report concluded, although the 
county Department of Social Services provides domestic violence liaisons who 
work with shelters to expedite financial aid applications. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury urged the county to better coordinate and publicize available 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Counties distribute funds from a $19 surcharge on California marriage licenses 
to domestic violence shelters, which also depend on various grants and 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
The report's release coincides with the expansion of the largest shelter in the 
San Gabriel Valley. Last Wednesday, Haven House -- a 36-bed sanctuary in 
Pasadena for families of violent alcoholics since 1964 -- celebrated the 
acquisition of property to accommodate 20 more people and a larger playground. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Child Doesn't Talk 
</P>
<P>
In one art-therapy drawing on display at Wednesday's event, a 12-year-old 
resident named Dennis had scrawled in crayon: "Dear daddy, please stop 
drinking. We want to come home. I do love you sometimes." Sean, 4, had drawn 
his father with stout arms and clenched fists. He depicted his mother and 
himself without hands. The boy had not talked for more than a year for fear of 
provoking one of his father's sudden rages. 
</P>
<P>
Every month Haven House receives about 100 calls from battered women, many with 
children, seeking shelter, said former Director Cindy Friedman. The shelter can 
accommodate only 100 families a year. 
</P>
<P>
The danger in having to turn women away is that the severity of violence tends 
to escalate, said Margaret Kukreja, outreach coordinator for the House of Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a predictable cycle that gets more and more intense," she said. About a 
third of the 400 hot line calls the 18-bed home receives are requests for 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"Most (women) have tried various things to resolve their situation, from 
counseling to the police" before resorting to shelters, said Sue Aebisher, 
director of the YWCA's WINGS home. WINGS, an acronym for Women in Need Growing 
Strong, will be doubling its capacity to 32 beds by September. 
</P>
<P>
By the time women are admitted to WINGS, nearly half have black eyes and 75% 
have been kicked or punched, sometimes severely enough to warrant medical 
attention, Aebisher said. Some women who were denied a place for lack of a bed 
have later shown up in worse condition, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're ready to go, you've got to go," said Anne (not her real name), who 
now staffs the WINGS hot line as a volunteer. "There was the fear that if I 
didn't get away it would be all over for me. I didn't want to wait around and 
get hit again." 
</P>
<P>
Joanne, a resident at Haven House, had called shelters around the county for a 
week without success. The failed attempts didn't make her life any easier. Her 
alcoholic husband, rarely left her alone after he discovered she had tried to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew it was always in the back of my mind," she said. "I wasn't allowed to 
be out anywhere without him." When she finally managed to escape with her two 
children, she found a place at Haven House. 
</P>
<P>
Once families arrive at the shelter, they are given counseling and can stay 45 
days while searching for jobs or permanent housing. As with all such shelters, 
the location of Haven House is kept secret from outsiders so abusers cannot 
track their partners down. 
</P>
<P>
Mary, who now volunteers at the House of Ruth, said the frustration of not 
getting in when she first called still makes her angry. During her last weeks 
with her husband, she said, he would drag her out of bed while she was asleep 
and beat her. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get up enough strength to call and get turned down, it's a very scary 
feeling," she said. "I'd probably be dead today if I didn't leave him when I 
did."

DEVELOPMENT WOULD WORSEN TRAFFIC IN FAIRFAX AREA; 
</P>
<P>
NEW STUDY RELEASED ON FARMERS MARKET PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A massive new development at Farmers Market would worsen traffic congestion in 
the Fairfax District despite measures proposed by the city's Department of 
Transportation, a draft environmental impact report said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the latest report, A. F. Gilmore Co., the owner and developer, 
said it is "committed to the exploration of all feasible traffic-mitigation 
measures" in the area of its 31-acre site at the corner of 3rd Street and 
Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it expects to spend $20 million toward that end: $1 million 
for a computerized traffic signal system, new signals and right-turn lanes; 
$2.5 million to encourage workers at the site to commute by car pools and 
public transportation, and $17 million in traffic-mitigation fees required by 
the city for long-term improvements. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the city has proposed widening Fairfax Avenue, installing traffic 
signals at several intersections, and computerizing traffic control to mitigate 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
But, the environmental impact report concluded, traffic generated by the 
shopping mall, theaters, hotel, office tower and residential apartments 
proposed for the site would result in "significant impacts" at six of 11 major 
intersections even after the initial mitigation measures are in place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Methane Deposits 
</P>
<P>
The report cited other likely environmental impacts, including possible 
disturbance of underground methane deposits, but it said they could all be 
mitigated except for the substantial increase in traffic and a small increase 
in smog. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers Market is just across 3rd Street from the Ross Dress For Less shop, 
where an underground pocket of methane exploded in 1985. The report said the 
new buildings should include vents to prevent such dangerous buildups. 
</P>
<P>
"The generated traffic is very, very substantial, no one's denying that," said 
David Weintraub, a city planner who oversaw the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the things they're going to do, they can fix most of it, but there's 
going to be trouble at those particular intersections," Weintraub said. 
</P>
<P>
The draft report, to be rewritten after a 70-day period of public input, was 
prepared at the expense of the A. F. Gilmore Co., which traces its ownership of 
the land back to 1880. 
</P>
<P>
Once part of the Mexican-era Rancho La Brea, the land was used over the years 
for a dairy, an oil field, a bank, a gas station, a baseball park and a 
drive-in theater. 
</P>
<P>
The corner of Fairfax Avenue and 3rd Street became an outlet for San Fernando 
Valley produce farmers in 1934, and the market has since become a tourist 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
The latest plans are the first to cover the entire property, one of the largest 
undeveloped areas on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for City Councilman John Ferraro, whose district includes Farmers 
Market, said it was too early for Ferraro to make a final decision on the 
proposal, which calls for 2 million square feet of development. 
</P>
<P>
"If it does not over-congest the area, he'll support it," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the environmental impact report, more than half of the 11 nearby 
intersections are already filled to what is supposed to be their maximum 
capacity during the evening rush hour. Three of them carry even more cars than 
they are designed for. 
</P>
<P>
But 3,395 additional trips can be expected during a typical evening rush hour 
if the Farmers Market project goes ahead as planned, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steps Fall Short 
</P>
<P>
The steps proposed by the Transportation Department would improve the flow of 
traffic at five intersections, but no improvements are possible at three other 
corners, and mitigation measures would fall short at the remaining three, the 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
The city's recommendations include a new lane of traffic between 3rd Street and 
Beverly Boulevard on Fairfax Avenue, which would allow the installation of a 
right-turn lane at the Beverly Boulevard intersection. 
</P>
<P>
New traffic signals would be installed at the intersections of Beverly 
Boulevard and Stanley Avenue, and at the 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue 
entrances to the project. 
</P>
<P>
The developer would also help pay for a computerized traffic-control program 
that the city hopes to introduce in much of the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Gibson, a transportation planner hired by the Gilmore Co., said other 
things could be done to improve the traffic flow, but they were excluded from 
the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the $17 million the company expects to be required to pay to the 
city's Traffic Mitigation Fund could go to buy property that would be used to 
widen existing streets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have to buy right of way, and since that's not directly under the control 
of the developer, the city won't let you put that in as a mitigation measure," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The report quoted city traffic engineers as saying the likelihood of such land 
buys was "extremely limited . . . or not feasible altogether." 
</P>
<P>
The Farmers Market project has been in the works for at least five years, but 
the release of the environmental impact report revealed more details about it 
than had been available before. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tower Would Be Shifted 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the original food courts at the corner of 3rd Street and Fairfax 
Avenue to remain, whereas newer buildings, including one that is topped by the 
tower that is the symbol of Farmers Market, would be removed. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Hilty, president of the Gilmore Co., said the tower would probably be 
erected somewhere else on the property. "It's kind of our image," he told a 
community group Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Gilmore Adobe, built in 1852, would be converted into a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Other plans include new shops along Fairfax, a retail complex of 1 million 
square feet, with landscaped atriums, theaters and restaurants, a hotel with up 
to 600 rooms, an office building of about 225,000 square feet and a 150-unit 
residential complex adjoining Pan Pacific Park. 
</P>
<P>
Hilty said the hotel and office towers would be placed away from the street to 
minimize the impact of the project on the neighborhood. He also said the 
development falls within the limits imposed by the slow-growth Proposition U 
initiative, which was passed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But public protests are expected during the 70 days that are available for 
citizen input before the final report is drawn up. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Plotkin, vice president of the Beverly-Wilshire Homeowners Assn., called 
the development "just too large for the 30 acres it sits on." 
</P>
<P>
She recalled that city officials were talking about a development of no more 
than 1 million square feet at the site several years ago, when a Metro Rail 
station was planned for Fairfax Avenue. At that time the adjacent CBS property 
was also part of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Ludicrous' 
</P>
<P>
"So to ask for 2 million square feet on 30-some acres, without a rail system, 
is ludicrous, for lack of a better word," she said. "The infrastructure just 
couldn't handle the kind of traffic this project would bring in." 
</P>
<P>
After the final report is submitted, the developer would need approval from 
various city agencies before the project could begin. 
</P>
<P>
Approval may be delayed because other projects have also been proposed for the 
area, including a 650,000-square-foot retail development owned by the company 
that controls the nearby Park Labrea apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Hilty said that if all goes well he hopes to see construction begin in the 
summer of 1990, with completion of the first phase in 1993 and the second phase 
in 1994.

REZONING PUTS WRECKING CREWS AT THEIR DOORSTEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Not long after carpenter Steve Hunter finished remodeling the interior of his 
home on a quiet, shady street in Hollywood, a neighbor knocked at his door with 
the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
It came in the form of a legal notice, tucked away in a newspaper's classified 
ads, announcing plans by a developer to demolish the house just two doors away 
from his. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethnically Diverse 
</P>
<P>
But the part that troubled Hunter most was that the property -- indeed, his 
entire neighborhood -- had been approved for rezoning from residential to light 
industrial. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked. We've lived here for seven years and this was the first I'd 
heard of it," said Hunter, who says that none of his Tamarind Avenue neighbors 
were aware of the plan, either. 
</P>
<P>
Yet city planners and officials of the Community Redevelopment Agency say that 
plans for the ethnically diverse neighborhood, sandwiched between Sunset-Gower 
Studios and the studios of KTLA television south of Sunset Boulevard, were no 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
They say the area, bordered by Sunset Boulevard, Bronson and Fountain avenues 
and Gordon Street, where an estimated 1,000 people live, has been targeted for 
limited industrial use since 1973, when the Los Angeles City Council adopted a 
community plan for Hollywood as part of the city's general plan. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, they say, at least three public hearings have addressed the issue, 
including one in 1986, when the area was included in the CRA's Hollywood 
redevelopment district, and another in 1987, when the City Council began 
considering the zoning change. They say residents were mailed notices of each 
of the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the rezoning last December and needs only to incorporate 
the decision into an ordinance to make it official. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the rezoning, the area of neat houses and small apartment buildings 
will become home to what city officials envision as a cluster of sound labs, 
film processors and other small companies serving the television and motion 
picture industries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Comfort 
</P>
<P>
But that is no consolation to Hunter and his neighbors, who accuse city 
officials and those of the CRA of plotting the destruction of their residential 
neighborhood without giving them an adequate chance to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"They can talk about public hearings all they want, but if nobody knew about 
them -- and nobody I know of did -- then what kind of justice is that?" said 
Hunter, who has joined dozens of his neighbors to oppose the rezoning. 
</P>
<P>
They have organized a vigil to prevent the first of two planned demolitions of 
houses in the neighborhood, a turn-of-the-century bungalow at 1433 Tamarind 
that is said to have once been the home of the late actor Jay Silverheels, who 
played Tonto in the TV series, "The Lone Ranger." 
</P>
<P>
However, Hunter acknowledges there is probably little the group can do to save 
the vacant house from the wrecking crew. 
</P>
<P>
A developer last week received CRA approval to tear down the house and build a 
4,000-square-foot rectangular industrial building with parking in what is now 
the front yard. Neptune Development Co. of Santa Monica still needs final 
approval from the Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another developer intends to raze a house across the street and 
build a three-story, 8,000-square-foot building with an eye toward attracting a 
variety of entertainment-related tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"They're gonna come in here and pick us off one house at a time, until there's 
nothing left," said Eddie Gevoglanian, who has lived in the neighborhood for 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Our property values will be shot down the tubes. Who's gonna want to live next 
to a machine shop? . . . There are people here whose equity in their homes is 
the only security they have, and this threatens to blow it all away." 
</P>
<P>
New residential construction has been prohibited in the area for three years, 
ever since the neighborhood was included by the CRA in the redevelopment 
district, city planner Michael Davies said. Once existing homes are sold and 
demolished, they may only be replaced with buildings approved for industrial 
use, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose and Mirna Rosales, who last year decided to add a bath and enlarge the 
master bedroom of their Tamarind Avenue home after living there for five years, 
apparently are the exception to the 3-year-old residential construction ban. 
That was because the Department of Building and Safety mistakenly issued 
permits for the work without first requiring the couple to obtain CRA approval, 
a CRA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nobody Told Us' 
</P>
<P>
However, the couple consider themselves anything but lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent $50,000 on our house, and we sure wouldn't have if we knew (the 
neighborhood) was going to be industrial," Mirna Rosales said. "We didn't get 
anything in the mail and nobody told us anything." 
</P>
<P>
Hank Iiyama, 68, who has lived in the neighborhood his entire life except for a 
year in a Japanese-American internment camp and two years in the Army during 
World War II, has a similar complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"Being retired, I make it my business to know what's going on with people in 
this neighborhood," said Iiyama, who said he found out about the rezoning two 
months ago, about the same time as Hunter. "Nobody I know was told anything 
about it."

CROWDED LANDFILLS HAVE TRASH HAULERS IN THE DUMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gate at the Puente Hills landfill, just off the Pomona Freeway, opens 
shortly before 6 every morning to admit a steady, seemingly endless parade of 
trash trucks, dump trucks, long-beds, tractor-trailers and pickups, all laden 
with refuse. 
</P>
<P>
It is a noisy procession of ugly, utilitarian vehicles, enlivened by an oddity 
here and there. One big refuse truck carries the slogan: "Drugs are Garbage." A 
tree service truck sputters forward so overloaded with branches and greenery 
that it seems to be lurching toward a mechanical breakdown. A pickup truck, 
dwarfed by the huge trucks alongside, moves forward with a light load: a broken 
stool, old garden hoses and a batch of odds and ends that probably sat for 
years in someone's garage. 
</P>
<P>
The air carries an odor that is not overwhelming, but a constant reminder that 
this is the largest dump in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Puente Hills is also, Sanitation District officials say, the second busiest 
landfill in the nation, trailing only a dump on Staten Island, N.Y., in trash 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of four large landfills in the San Gabriel Valley, any or all of 
which may soon become even busier if the city of Los Angeles is forced to close 
its landfill at Lopez Canyon. The city and state Waste Management Board are 
disputing how much trash can be deposited at that landfill, which now handles 
about 4,000 tons of trash a day. City officials say they could be forced to 
shut down the landfill within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the addition of Lopez Canyon trash, dumps in the San Gabriel 
Valley handle 26,000 tons of trash every day, more than half of the trash 
dumped in Los Angeles County. Landfills now reduce their hours to stay within 
their daily disposal limits. And as dumps continue to fill and close early, 
trucks must travel farther, meaning more air pollution and higher trash 
collection costs. 
</P>
<P>
At Puente Hills, the lines of trucks is so long that it often takes them half 
an hour to travel up the hill from the main gate to the weigh station, even at 
four or five abreast. There, weighmasters at computer terminals calculate the 
size of the cargo and collect the fees in cash or on a credit card before 
directing the trucks farther up the hill to unloading areas. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Grigorian, who runs a seven-truck disposal company in El Monte, says it's 
getting a lot more expensive to run a trash business these days, with 
insurance, fuel and vehicle costs all rising and dumps boosting their fees. 
Twelve years ago, he said, he could unload a ton of trash for 75 cents; now he 
pays $11.60 at Puente Hills, even more at other dumps. 
</P>
<P>
Sarkis Avisyan, who drives a truck for a Gardena rubbish hauler, said: 
"Nobody's happy." Just three years ago, he said, he could haul eight loads of 
trash to Puente Hills in one day. Now, he said, because there are so many trash 
trucks crowding into a dwindling number of landfills, "I'm only making three or 
four trips a day." 
</P>
<P>
Each trip takes longer because of the waits in line, and unless he gets to 
Puente Hills before noon, he is in danger of being turned away because the 
landfill will have reached its daily disposal limit. 
</P>
<P>
Avisyan said his boss used to handle his trash business with two trucks and two 
drivers; now he needs four trucks and four drivers to get the same volume of 
trash to the dump. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Maguin, who oversees Puente Hills and other landfills run by the Los 
Angeles County Sanitation Districts, said trash haulers are using more trucks 
and sending them farther because of the shortage of landfill space. Maguin said 
early daily closure of the Puente Hills landfill is becoming "more and more 
routine." 
</P>
<P>
One one typical day last week, for example, 1,748 trucks passed through the 
gates, depositing 13,200 tons of trash by 1:50 p.m. At that point, workers ran 
a blue flag up a pole near the weigh station to warn truck drivers approaching 
on the Pomona Freeway not to bother to turn off because the landfill was closed 
for the day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
18,000 Tons a Week 
</P>
<P>
When Puente Hills is closed, most trash trucks head for the Sanitation 
Districts' Spadra landfill in Pomona or the privately owned BKK landfill in 
West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Maguin said the Spadra landfill, which is permitted to receive 18,000 tons of 
trash a week, is beginning to fill up early too, partly because of the overflow 
from Puente Hills and partly because of the growth in the East San Gabriel 
Valley area. It is scheduled to close at 5 p.m., but has been shutting down at 
3 or 4 in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The prime beneficiary of the landfill shortage has been the West Covina 
landfill owned by the BKK Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, when its landfill was the only hazardous waste dump open in 
Southern California, the BKK Corp. was said to own a money machine, grossing 
$23 million a year for taking in waste that no one else could handle. 
</P>
<P>
But the revenue dropped abruptly in 1984, when state and federal regulators 
discovered that the bottom of the landfill was not impervious to leaks. Under 
pressure from the public and regulators, BKK Corp. closed its landfill to 
hazardous waste. Reduced to competing with other dumps for ordinary household 
trash, BKK Corp. saw its landfill revenue plummet to under $7 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disastrous," said corporate counsel Ronald Gastelum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenue Up Again 
</P>
<P>
But now, with landfill space for ordinary household trash becoming increasingly 
scarce, the BKK landfill is becoming a huge revenue-producer again. 
</P>
<P>
The city of West Covina, which levies a 10% tax on landfill revenue, estimates 
that the BKK landfill will gross $25 million to $30 million this year. And the 
total could be much higher. The BKK Corp. reported to the city that it took in 
$2.9 million in April, the last month for which figures are available. That's a 
yearly rate of $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum said the landfill is receiving 9,500 to 10,000 tons of trash a day, 
ranking it just behind Puente Hills in trash volume countywide. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we're the safety valve for Puente Hills," Gastelum said. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that most garbage haulers would rather unload at Puente Hills, 
or the Spadra landfill in Pomona because their disposal rates are cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
The Sanitation Districts charge haulers $11.60 a ton to unload trash at Puente 
Hills or Spadra. BKK's basic charge is $17 a ton, plus the city tax. 
</P>
<P>
Rates at the privately owned Azusa Land Reclamation Co. landfill in Azusa are 
even higher -- $18.75 a ton. It is operating at capacity, 1,500 tons a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restricted Landfill 
</P>
<P>
The Sanitation Districts also run the Scholl Canyon landfill, which is owned by 
the city of Glendale and accepts trash only from Glendale, Pasadena, South 
Pasadena, La Canada Flintridge, San Marino and Sierra Madre. It takes about 
2,500 tons of trash a day at $16.60 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
Maguin said the county sanitation districts have prohibited Los Angeles from 
dumping trash at the Puente Hills and Spadra landfills, and Scholl Canyon 
cannot take Los Angeles trash because L.A. is outside the boundary lines 
established by the city of Glendale. Officials at Azusa Land Reclamation Co. 
said they don't have room to take any trash from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But the BKK landfill already takes some trash from Los Angeles. Gastelum said 
BKK could not handle all of the Los Angeles trash that now goes to Lopez Canyon 
but would "be willing to help out on a temporary basis," taking some of that 
volume for six months or so while the city searches for other alternatives. In 
return, he said, BKK Corp. would like a chance to participate in the recycling 
program that the city is developing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Problems 
</P>
<P>
West Covina City Manager Herman R. (Bob) Fast said more trash from Los Angeles 
might create traffic problems near the dump. If it does, he said, the city 
would ask BKK Corp. to regulate the hours of disposal to ease congestion. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the city has been advised by its attorney that it has no legal 
right to restrict the source of the trash BKK takes. 
</P>
<P>
Fast said that if BKK increases its trash volume, one benefit might be to 
advance the dump's closure date by a few months by filling the disposal area 
early. BKK Corp. has an agreement with the city to close its West Covina 
landfill in 1995 or earlier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Dump 
</P>
<P>
The company is attempting to establish a new dump at Elsmere Canyon near 
Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
The Elsmere Canyon landfill is one of a number of proposals to provide new dump 
capacity in Los Angeles County. There are also proposals to haul trash by rail 
to remote disposal sites, outside the county. 
</P>
<P>
But, Maguin said, none of the alternatives is likely to occur soon, and the 
landfill shortage may worsen. 
</P>
<P>
With landfills already closing early, trash trucks spending more time on the 
road and trash rates going up, Maguin said, "I don't know what more has to 
happen" to arouse public concern. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "if Lopez Canyon were to close, that really forces the issue." 
The whole trash collection system, he said, "is so finely balanced that we have 
no slack."

<P>
The announcer of the British Broadcasting Co. radio program, "The World News," 
signs off in a clear and pleasant voice, untroubled by calamity. "This," the 
broadcaster says, "is the end of 'The World News.' " It is a phrase easy to 
misconstrue. Anthony Burgess, author of "Clockwork Orange," thought so, too. 
Another of his books is called "The End of the World News." 
</P>
<P>
American essayist and novelist Marilynne Robinson tells us in "Mother Country," 
her own end-of-the-world news, that Great Britain is the largest commercial 
producer of plutonium in the world. Great Britain is also "the largest source, 
by far, of radioactive contamination of the world's environment." 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear waste arriving in England from client countries -- Japan, Germany, 
Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Holland and Spain among them -- is likely to enter 
England at the port of Dover for transport by train on a diagonal cross-country 
journey via London to Cumbria on the shores of the Irish Sea. 
</P>
<P>
There, at Sellafield, on a site shared with Calder Hall, Britain's first, aging 
and still-operating nuclear power station (1956), the waste is processed by 
government-owned British Nuclear Fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Sellafield is near the Lake District, a countryside so beautiful, one map 
exults, "few places can compare." It is Wordsworth country, Beatrix Potter 
country, shepherd's country; fells and dales with wonderful names: Windermere, 
Buttermere. But the lambs on the deep green hills are radioactive. 
</P>
<P>
At Sellafield -- called Windscale until the disgrace of a major nuclear 
accident in 1957 -- the houses are radioactive. So are -- because of 30 years' 
contamination, occasional bursts of high emission and irradiated slicks -- the 
Irish Sea and its spray, the sand, the seaweed and flotsam, the fish, the boats 
and the wind. One in 60 children in nearby Seascale village dies of leukemia, a 
rate 1,000 times the national average. 
</P>
<P>
Really. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear accident at Chernobyl was a boon to Sellafield apologists. Its 
fallout, they say, contaminated Cumbrian fields and lambs. No one had tested 
local livestock for radiation before Chernobyl; no one, in fact, tested the 
livestock for months after. (And the only post-Chernobyl Geiger-counter 
readings on the west coast of England were made by a high school science 
class.) But Sellafield is closer to Cumbria than Chernobyl is, by many thousand 
miles, and "so productive of contamination that there is no reason to look 
elsewhere for a source." 
</P>
<P>
What happens at Sellafield? The waste products of British and foreign nuclear 
reactors are delivered, cleansed with solvents (if "cleansed" is the right 
word), processed to yield usable, salable plutonium and uranium, and disposed 
of (if "disposed" is the right word). 
</P>
<P>
Sellafield is part of the power industry (in England a government monopoly) 
because it handles the wastes of British reactors which produce power. 
Sellafield has a military function because its processing produces 
weapons-grade plutonium for British military use. Its civilian cum military 
function, Robinson says, "limits its accessibility to EEC (European Economic 
Community) inspection, among other advantages." 
</P>
<P>
Britain has long produced its own toxic wastes. It was, after all, the cradle 
of the Industrial Revolution. Britain has long imported chemical toxics, for 
profitable disposal. Now it has found that disposal of imported nuclear waste 
is profitable, too. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's attitude toward virulent waste is relatively carefree. There is no 
legal obligation, for instance, to warn developers that a site has been a toxic 
dump. There is no restriction on the use of radioactive materials in British 
goods. Poisoning the well, Robinson says, is "established practice . . . a bit 
of 19th-Century tradition." 
</P>
<P>
According to Robinson and the many journalists whose articles comprise the 
20-page Selected Bibliography at the back of "Mother Country," Britain is still 
poisoning the well. 
</P>
<P>
"Their solution to the problem," Robinson says, "amounts to extracting as much 
usable plutonium and uranium from the waste as they find practicable and 
flushing the rest into the sea or venting it through smokestacks into the air. 
There are waste silos, some of which leak uncontrollably. In an area called 
Driggs, near Sellafield, wastes are buried in shallow earth trenches. Until the 
practice was supposedly ended in 1983 by the refusal of the National Union of 
Seamen to man the ships, barrels of nuclear waste were dropped routinely into 
the Atlantic. In other words, Britain has not solved the problem of nuclear 
waste, and has, in fact, greatly compounded it in the course of producing 
plutonium in undivulged quantities." 
</P>
<P>
Two kilometers or 1.2 miles offshore, a "lake" of plutonium lies under the 
Irish Sea, formed by the million-gallon-a-day discharge from Sellafield's 
pipeline. A contaminated slick in 1983 brought radiation to levels ten thousand 
times background. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, "Sellafield is no secret," yet the press outside Britain does not 
report its significance. Despite censure in the world courts, despite local 
protest and that of the nearest international neighbors, despite criticism in 
the British media, Sellafield is expanding. Sellafield must expand, to handle 
the increasing volume of nuclear waste entrusted to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother Country" is not itself investigative reporting, but a sequential 
interpretation of other people's reportage. It is not a primary work of 
science; its data was gathered by British journalists. This second-stage 
journalism, from a citizen-of-the-world stunned by what she read in British 
newspapers, is a tocsin meant to warn Americans -- or anyone who will listen -- 
of a grave situation. 
</P>
<P>
How can such things happen? So asks a book-within-the-book where Robinson looks 
to the past, even unto Poor Law of the 14th Century, for the secrets of 
national character. What does she find? That beneath the famous civility the 
British have always wasted lives and credited the idea of human surplus; that 
there have in the past been policies of depopulation. That there is a lack "of 
positive, substantive personal and political rights." That industrial illness 
and accident are common and customary. That there has never been a minimum 
wage. That many factors, including the Official Secrets Act, restrict the flow 
of information. That the (non-elected) Permanent Civil Service is professional 
and very powerful. That bumbling amateurism is still respectable, with chilling 
ramifications -- an inability to gather meaningful statistics, for instance, or 
to keep track of such crucial documents as half the mortality data on workers 
at Windscale. That the citizenry is passive. That it is hard to locate 
responsibility, and that profit is motive and justification enough for almost 
anything.

IN PURSUIT OF JUSTICE REFLECTIONS OF A STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BY JOSEPH R. 
GRODIN WITH A FOREWORD BY JUSTICE WILLIAM J. BRENNAN JR. (UNIVERSITY OF 
CALIFORNIA PRESS: $20; 200 PP.; 0-520-06654-5)

<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyers -- and therefore, in our system, judges -- are really rather dreary 
people. Books about lawyers are thus, by definition, not likely to excite 
interest unless they excite hatred, ridicule and contempt. Books by lawyers are 
likely to have even less sex appeal. Judicial autobiographies -- or "My Life as 
a Judge" -- have not been among our most exciting forms of literary expression. 
</P>
<P>
I once made a living as a legal historian, writing about judges. I found 
judicial autobiographies, especially those from the 19th Century, highly 
revealing -- normally unintentionally. They are certainly not regarded as 
literary masterpieces, quite rightly so. Judges, like university presidents, 
tend to have a rather pompous, authoritarian style. 
</P>
<P>
It is, however, important to study judicial biographies. We think we can learn 
a great deal about poetry by learning about the poet; we similarly think we can 
learn a great deal about the interpretation of novels by studying the life -- 
with its adequacies and inadequacies -- of the novelist. For some reason, 
because we live with the wonderful myth that law is, somehow or other, a series 
of self-contained rules, we do not study the lives of the judges or the lives 
of lawyers who make it. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Joseph R. Grodin has offered us an opportunity to remedy this lacuna. 
He has written an engaging book. It is not a book for everyone; it may be too 
technical for the layman and too colloquial for the lawyer. Yet it is a book 
that deserves study. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Grodin began life as a lawyer, dabbled in being a law professor, served 
in the Jerry Brown Administration, found himself on the Court of Appeal in 
1975, moved onto the Supreme Court of California, and was defeated with Chief 
Justice Rose Bird in 1986. With this background, it is scarcely surprising that 
the good Justice, who has now returned to teaching law, does a certain amount 
of special pleading. At the same time, Grodin has a good deal of common sense. 
He is obviously a person of integrity and decency, and while lawyers will 
prickle at the simplistic approach he takes to explaining the common law and at 
some of his forays into constitutional issues, they are issues that we all need 
to address in one form or another. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gaul, "In Pursuit of Justice" is divided into three parts. The first, 
"Structure," deals with the mechanics of becoming a judge and how the appeals 
process works in the state of California. It is both useful and reasonably 
entertaining. It will, however, disappoint the aficionados of the gossip 
column, since it does not "spill the beans" about how the Supreme Court of our 
state operates, or did operate, in certain crucial cases. 
</P>
<P>
Some issues are brushed over. It is easy to write platitudes about the "legal 
explosion" that is going on in this country, but Grodin dismisses it rather 
casually. One would expect a society that did not have a tradition of 
autocratic government, or even a tradition -- especially in the West -- of a 
clearly delineated hierarchy, to resort to those concepts we know as law as a 
means of deciding disputes and of influencing decisions. Yet, as a society, we 
have to make some important choices here, and it would have been attractive to 
hear what Grodin thought. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he explains the confirmation process of a judge in 
extraordinarily human terms, and as he looks back to his predecessors, he 
reminds us how recent the history of our state is. That, in itself, explains a 
great deal. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps inadvertently, Grodin also raises some interesting issues of 
jurisprudence. He challenges our intelligence by making us think about the "at 
will" concept of employment. He raises the jurisprudential -- or constitutional 
-- issue raised by the city of Azusa, which banned fortunetellers but not 
stockbrokers in its ordinance against psychics. The court had to decide whether 
fortunetelling was a fraud, while stock market prediction was a science. That 
is a distinction worthy of an intellectual tussle. 
</P>
<P>
In part two, "Function," we are taken on a quick tour of the common law. Again, 
the study is going to satisfy no one. The treatment of products liability might 
intrigue a high school civics class, but it might not. The foray into the 
criminal law again underlines the distorting effect of the death penalty -- a 
distortion that has gone on since the 17th Century. Perhaps the most 
interesting part of what one might call the "action" part of the book concerns 
the initiative process. 
</P>
<P>
As an immigrant to California, I found it difficult not to be intrigued by the 
initiative process. I realize that, in many ways, it is sacred to progressives 
and conservatives alike. Coming out of the muckraking period, it is a process 
much endorsed by those who stand at any particular time to benefit from it. 
Grodin takes the position that Magleby does, namely that too often the 
initiative process is not really giving "power to the people," but is much more 
the "instrument of special interest groups." 
</P>
<P>
As Grodin looks at Proposition 14 in 1966 (the proposition that appeared to 
allow discrimination in housing and purported to forbid the Constitution ever 
to allow an anti-discrimination provision), and as he describes Proposition 8 
in 1982 (the so-called Victim's Bill of Rights), I can understand his concern 
about the process. I suspect that, if we had an initiative process at the 
Federal level, Brown vs. The Board of Education and the Miranda decisions might 
well have led to changes in the Constitution: not, for me anyway, an attractive 
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
I have only had the privilege of voting once in California. I still have the 
old-fashioned notion that my delegates to Sacramento and Washington ought to be 
spending their time thinking through the logical way of balancing the public 
interest in everything from taxation to insurance. I certainly do not give up 
my right to criticize them, but I wonder if I should have the constant right to 
overrule them and second-guess them. Recalls and initiatives sound so 
wonderful, but just as judicial review can be misused and can undermine the 
legislature, is it not possible that the California initiative system has gone 
overboard? Are we really taking away the sense of responsibility from our 
legislators? Grodin does not go quite as far as I would go, but he raises some 
interesting and important issues and ones that we all ought to be discussing 
rather than being influenced by the manipulators and the media, who would have 
us believe that their paymasters know better than the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, throughout the book, Grodin raises some interesting questions about 
constitutional law and the constitutional process. His notions of "independent 
state grounds" in developing the California Constitution are attractive. Again, 
I would have wished he had raised some more basic issues about basic laws. When 
the Supreme Court has decided -- as it did in 1972 -- that the death penalty 
constituted cruel and unusual punishment, did it really make sense to have that 
overruled by the initiative process? 
</P>
<P>
The final part of the book, "Perspective and Evaluation," is in its own way 
quite disappointing. There is a fascinating passage where Grodin, the liberal 
Democrat, finds himself surprisingly sympathetic to Judge Robert Bork in his 
public hearings in Washington. The personal reactions to the common-law and the 
election process, however, seem somewhat flawed. 
</P>
<P>
The excursion is obviously necessary to get to the last chapter of the book, 
which deals with the election of judges. Parts of that chapter make good 
reading. There is a useful survey -- historically somewhat inaccurate -- about 
the growth of the elective process. When I was practicing law in England -- and 
from the time I spent as a law teacher there -- I frequently regretted that I 
did not have the ability to vote against certain judges. On the other hand, 
running for office and the role of the judiciary, one would have to admit, may 
not be entirely complementary. 
</P>
<P>
As Grodin describes his own unsuccessful attempt at reelection, it is 
impossible not to feel sympathetic. He could defend his record. He could make 
no promises. Elections tend to be decided on promises. A French skeptic in the 
19th Century noted that lawsuits existed to decide who could afford the better 
lawyer. Grodin takes the position -- although he does not articulate it -- that 
the judicial elections exist to see who has the deeper pocket to influence the 
electorate. It turned out that Chief Justice Rose Bird and Associate Justice 
Cruz Reynoso did not. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the so-called commission system, which is now used 
increasingly in the other states, understandably has its detractors. Such 
commissions tend to be dominated by establishment lawyers who put in 
establishment judges. Much silliness is written about the establishment, but 
here is a worry that a judiciary like ours, which has to make important policy 
and even political decisions, should not be so insulated from public opinion 
that it is totally insensitive to it. It has to operate in a Cardozo-like 
atmosphere sensitive to public values. 
</P>
<P>
Like the preview at the movies, my job is to titillate rather than satisfy. 
Grodin's book is not a must; it is, however, a good read. I wish I felt clearer 
about the audience he intends to address, but I do have a feeling that those 
who care about the governance of this state should read it more than casually.

THE NEW SOVIET FICTION SIXTEEN SHORT STORIES BY SERGEI ZALYGIN (ABBEVILLE 
PRESS: $22.50; 318 PP.; ILLUSTRATED; 0-89659-881-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Josephine Woll, Woll teaches Russian literature at Howard University and is 
completing a book on the Soviet novelist Iurii Trifonov. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is fitting that Sergei Zalygin chose the stories included in this volume of 
recent Soviet prose. As the editor of the foremost Soviet literary monthly, 
Novyi mir (New World), Zalygin inherits the mantle of his admirable 
predecessor, Aleksandr Tvardovskii. When Tvardovskii edited Novyi mir in the 
1950s and 1960s, he took every one of the few opportunities available to him to 
publish poetry and prose that pushed at the limits of what was then 
permissible. It was Tvardovskii who got the manuscript of Solzhenitsyn's "One 
Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich" into Khrushchev's hands, and -- with 
Khrushchev's personal approval -- onto the pages of his magazine. Now, 25 years 
later, it is Zalygin who has repeatedly promised his readers Solzhenitsyn's 
work, including "The Gulag Archipelago," though he has so far been foiled by 
ideological watchdogs. (The October, 1988, issue of Novyi mir, its back cover 
heralding Solzhenitsyn's publication in the new year, was kept back until a new 
cover could be printed.) 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two or three years, under Zalygin's editorial guidance, Novyi mir 
has been one of the very few journals to open its pages to both "conservative" 
and "liberal" voices, though its bias favors the pro-Gorbachev, pro-perestroika 
forces. Some of the boldest commentaries on the Soviet economic crisis and on 
Soviet history -- including a scathing critique of Lenin -- regularly share 
space with poetry and prose from the past and the present, from the emigre 
heritage (Nabokov, Brodsky) and from "internal emigres" whose voices were 
silent for the last decade or more. ("Doctor Zhivago" finally made its 
appearance in Novyi mir's first four issues of 1988.) 
</P>
<P>
That same ungrudging welcome of diversity is evident in Zalygin's selection of 
stories for this anthology. Two of the stories, I. Grekova's "No Smiles" and 
Vladimir Soloukhin's "Stepanida Ivanovna's Funeral," were written 20 years 
before they finally reached their readers; several others date from 1986-87, 
but more than half of the 16 stories were published before 1986, which is when 
most observers date the real blossoming of glasnost. That does not by any means 
make them bad stories: On the contrary, several of these "early" works are 
among the strongest in the book. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the stories -- ably translated on the whole -- were written in 
Russian, but several authors are non-Russian, offering foreign readers a rare 
glimpse of life in Baku (Elchin's "Auto Accident in Paris"), in Tallinn 
(Valton's "Love in Mustamagi"), in Soviet Georgia (Mishveladze's "A Question 
Mark and an Exclamation Point"). Stylistic and philosophical traditionalists 
such as Soloukhin and Valentin Rasputin comfortably coexist with the modernist 
self-consciousness of Andrei Bitov and the disorienting fantasy of Viktor 
Konetsky. Zalygin seems to have been guided by a desire to offer American 
readers some sense of the range of fiction now available to Soviets, and while 
his choices are perhaps a little cautious, by and large they succeed: No 
generalities about gray Soviet prose or "socialist realism" will survive a 
reading of this motley work. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, I will venture a few generalizations. Several of the most 
readable and accessible stories re-create everyday Soviet life with all its 
grim scarcity and frustration. Soloukhin's 20-year-old description of trying to 
bury his mother, first published in 1987, is a howl of pain. He is outraged by 
an economy in which even coffins are a "deficit product" for which he must 
stand in line; he is maddened by a bureaucracy that makes him lie or pull 
strings simply to get a priest to officiate. Most of all he is contemptuous of 
a system that transforms a funeral into a battlefield, forcing grief to be 
displaced by involuntary triumph at hard-won victories. Less emotional but no 
less telling are Vladimir Makanin's "Antileader" and Tatyana Tolstaya's "Fire 
and Dust." These are two of the most gifted artists currently writing, and both 
portray ordinary people -- loving, weak -- whose dreams are corroded by time 
and whose inarticulate envy sometimes explodes in violence. 
</P>
<P>
Several stories involve fantasy. Sometimes fantasy abruptly tears an otherwise 
dryly realistic fabric. In the Estonian story, "Love in Mustamagi," an ideal 
love consummated in long stares and meaning smiles engenders -- somehow -- a 
baby girl, imposing a humorous, implausible perfection on an altogether 
imperfect world. Bitov's "Pushkin's Photograph" sends a man of the future back 
to the era of Pushkin in order to photograph the poet and record his voice. 
With the blend of playfulness and erudition familiar from his novel, "Pushkin 
House" (Farrar Straus Giroux, 1987), Bitov's time-travel goes awry. Past and 
future, poetry and history, imagination and reality blur into a phantasmagoria 
with its own logic but without conventional boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The most explicitly political story in the volume is I. Grekova's "No Smiles." 
Grekova, now in her 80s, is a mathematician by profession as well as a 
consistently published writer of stories and novellas. (Two of the latter came 
out in a Harcourt Brace Jovanovich volume entitled "Russian Women" in 1983.) 
This story, however, was not published when it was written in 1970, and no 
wonder. "No Smiles" concerns the hounding of a scientist who is accused of a 
"fallacious orientation in research," and though it is set in an unspecified 
country in the vague future, it reeks of Soviet truth. The sour taste of 
ostracism is acutely conveyed in the heroine's sense that she has entered a 
hostile world: Once able to count on an amiable environment, she is revolted to 
find herself counting the smiles in the corridor instead. 
</P>
<P>
Without personally enduring such an experience, one is unlikely to get closer 
to the hideous ordeal of a "Discussion" -- that is, a witch hunt disguised as 
constructive collegial criticism -- than via "No Smiles." The heroine's dry 
mouth and "heavy feeling of flight," as if she were watching from the ceiling; 
her unspoken commentary on the rank careerists and the true believers; her 
ringing ears and the sporadic deafness that turns her ranting critics into 
ludicrous silent movie actors -- it is all so real and so vile that her courage 
is astounding. "I refuse to admit my mistakes," she says, as if she has no 
choice but to be courageous, "because there were none. I am right. Burn me if 
you will, but I can't do anything else." Grekova is no relativist: She is 
willing to identify heroism; she recognizes integrity. But neither she nor her 
heroine ever becomes complacent, or reduces complexity to simple categories. 
And both of them recognize the appallingly high price that heroism and 
integrity can exact. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, not every story in "The New Soviet Fiction" will appeal to every 
reader. But anyone who is curious about today's Soviet society, who wonders 
about the reality and limits of glasnost, or who simply likes good fiction, can 
gain a great deal from this volume.

LET HISTORY JUDGE THE ORIGINS AND CONSEQUENCES OF STALINISM A REVISED AND 
EXPANDED EDITION BY ROY A. MEDVEDEV; TRANSLATED BY GEORGE SHRIVER (COLUMBIA

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a cold and wet evening in what passed for spring in Moscow in 1976 when 
I first met Roy Medvedev. My wife and I had made our way to his apartment on 
the far edge of the city, by Metro, bus, and finally on foot, feeling like 
underground conspirators and hoping we were not followed. Medvedev then was one 
of the Soviet Union's three best-known dissidents, along with Andrei Sakharov 
and the then recently exiled Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Today, living testimony to 
the Gorbachev revolution, Medvedev is not only published openly in Soviet 
newspapers and journals but has been elected along with Sakharov as a deputy to 
the new Congress of the People and to the Supreme Soviet, where he has become 
an eloquent voice for democracy. In December he is scheduled to come to this 
country and to address the convention of the American Historical Assn. in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev became world famous when his magnum opus on Stalinism, the original 
edition of "Let History Judge," was smuggled out and published in English 
translation in 1972. In the next few years the work appeared in the other major 
Western languages and even in Japanese and Chinese. In response, the Brezhnev 
government deprived Medvedev of both his job and his Communist Party 
membership, and the KGB subjected him to constant surveillance and harassment. 
</P>
<P>
That was an era when the aging Communist bureaucracy was bent on rehabilitating 
the memory of Stalin, clouded ever since Nikita Khrushchev's well-known "Secret 
Speech" of 1956. They were doing everything they could to perpetuate Stalin's 
totalitarian system of rule, even if their scale of arrests and killings was 
more modest. Critical inquiries and exposes of the historical truth such as 
Medvedev devoted himself to were intolerable to the party hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
The wonder is that Medvedev was never actually arrested and jailed or deported 
like Solzhenitsyn, or like his own twin brother, Zhores Medvedev. Zhores, an 
eminent biologist as well as political critic in his own right, was deprived of 
his Soviet citizenship in 1973 while he was on a research visit to England, 
where he still lives and supervises the foreign publication of Roy's work. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with Medvedev that night 13 years ago, I asked him how he managed to 
produce such a monumental work as "Let History Judge," along with the flood of 
writings that followed, considering the difficult conditions of his life and 
work. "I don't do it all myself," he explained. "People are bringing me 
materials all the time. I have a whole institute." 
</P>
<P>
As Medvedev observes in the preface to the new edition of "Let History Judge," 
"A person who works openly on the subject of Stalin and Stalinism in the Soviet 
Union inevitably becomes a center of attraction for many who wish to express 
their opinions or impart testimony on this question, which is still a very sore 
subject in Soviet society." Nonetheless, it was with extraordinary courage and 
rare insight that Medvedev took on the unique task of marshaling and telling 
the historical truth about Stalinism, from inside the system. 
</P>
<P>
As a book written from the inside, where "dangerous" source materials were shut 
away in the "special preserves" of the libraries, and the major Western works 
were available only when they could be smuggled in, "Let History Judge" was an 
extraordinary accomplishment, both of description and of explanation. Although, 
as Western reviewers noted at the time, Medvedev was reluctant to dispute the 
merits of Lenin and the 1917 revolution, he produced a compelling and original 
account, "a history of a disease," showing how the revolution went wrong in 
Stalin's hands, and how the tyrant found support for his "usurpation of power" 
and his annihilation of the Communist Old Guard among the same sort of 
"petty-bourgeois" elements of society who supported fascism in Western Europe 
between the wars. To be sure, Medvedev retained the overall Marxist schema and 
language about history and society -- he still does -- but as he pointed out to 
me, "The Marxist frame of reference is the only one Russians know, thanks to 
their indoctrination, so the only way to reach them with new ideas is within 
the Marxist framework." 
</P>
<P>
Today, under Gorbachev's perestroika -- "restructuring" -- and glasnost -- 
"openness" -- Medvedev enjoys vastly more positive conditions for his work. 
Oceans of new information, both Soviet source material and the accumulation of 
Western studies, have become available to him. At the same time, the Gorbachev 
era has put Stalinism in a new perspective, giving it an end (so it seems) as 
well as a beginning, which makes it possible to look at that era in a more 
historical way. 
</P>
<P>
These circumstances have not required Medvedev to alter his basic beliefs. As 
he emphasizes in the preface to the new edition, "The author of this book has 
modified his views in many respects to make them more precise, but he has 
maintained his adherence to socialist ideals," to the discomfiture of critics 
on both the far left and the far right. This ideal, he notes toward the end, 
"does not guarantee full equality of material possibilities or an equal 
position in society to everyone, because people differ individually. Socialism 
must, however, ensure substantial progress toward equality in the most 
important sense -- equality of rights and obligations, just treatment of all, 
and equal opportunity for all to discover and develop their talents and 
abilities. It must reduce the flagrant material inequality that exists under 
capitalism, eliminating both excessive wealth and humiliating poverty." 
Medvedev still regards Stalinism as nothing but "barracks pseudosocialism," 
distinguished by its overgrown bureaucracy, its deception of the masses, and 
the hypocritical and corrupt pursuit of elite privilege. 
</P>
<P>
The nature of Stalin's rule, including his mammoth crimes in the 
collectivization of the peasants, the artificial famine of 1932-33, and the 
purges of 1936-38, is now well known and beyond dispute, to Soviet historians 
as well as Westerners. There are only more gory details that keep coming out 
about this story, which Medvedev recounts in full. What remains more debatable 
is explaining how Stalin could establish the kind of system that permitted him 
to commit these monstrosities, "even worse than Hitler," as another eminent 
Soviet scholar recently remarked to me. 
</P>
<P>
This question was raised as long ago as 1956 when the Italian Communist leader 
Palmiro Togliatti, asserting his own independence, took issue with Khrushchev 
for putting all the blame on Stalin's demented personality. "The true problems 
are evaded," Togliatti charged in a famous interview shortly after the "Secret 
Speech" was made public by the United States government, "which are why and how 
Soviet society could reach and did reach certain forms alien to the democratic 
way and to the legality which it had set for itself, even to the point of 
degeneration." 
</P>
<P>
There are some in the Soviet Union who now argue, like many Western writers, 
that Communist ideology has been the key to the Soviet tyranny all along. One 
such critic is Alexander Tsipko of the Institute of the Economics of the World 
Socialist System in Moscow, a hotbed of progressive and critical thinking, who 
openly puts the blame on Marx's Communist utopia combined with the abstract 
messianism of the pre-revolutionary Russian intellectuals. Tsipko rejects the 
notion of betrayal or counterrevolution under Stalin, echoed by writers from 
Leon Trotsky to Medvedev himself, on the ground that this theory detracts from 
the responsibility that should rest on the revolutionary thinkers who preceded 
him. 
</P>
<P>
While that argument is persuasive at first glance, it does not stand up against 
the actual story of Stalin's rise to power between 1917 and 1929. Here, in a 
major expansion of his book based on Western studies, Medvedev shows how Stalin 
was opposed at one time or another by practically every other leading Russian 
Marxist, not to mention innumerable Social Democrats and Communist schismatics 
outside the Soviet Union. It is too much to credit Stalin, as his sycophants 
did, with being the highest oracle of Marxist truth; Medvedev conveys the far 
more realistic picture of a cynical, opportunistic, and above all egomaniac 
power grabber who learned early on how to manipulate Marxist-Leninist doctrine 
to entrap or bamboozle the true believers. By the time of the purges, he now 
concludes, "Stalin wielded such power as no Russian tzar or any other dictator 
of the past thousand years has possessed." 
</P>
<P>
This, however, does not bring us any closer to understanding how it was 
possible for such a warped and vicious man to take over the Brave New World. 
Medvedev demolishes the view that Stalin was merely the implementation of 
Lenin, but like most newly liberated Soviet historians, he still tiptoes around 
the question of Lenin's responsibility for the one-party system and the 
centralized party bureaucracy that set up the country for Stalin's takeover. 
"De-Leninization," it seems fair to say, remains the last hurdle for 
perestroika in Soviet history.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE JACKSON PHENOMENON THE MAN, THE POWER, THE MESSAGE BY

Early in her account of Jesse Jackson's 1988 campaign for President of the 
United States, Elizabeth Colton makes it clear that, although she worked as 
Jackson's press secretary from January, 1988, until the election, she intends 
to include the unflattering as well as the laudatory. Colton briefly recounts 
the years that Jackson spent methodically building a power base with his own 
grass-roots organization, PUSH, originally People United to Save Humanity, 
though the save was soon replaced with the less grandiose serve. Colton notes 
the particular attention Jackson has paid to cultivating a following among the 
young. His first appearances at schools were in 1971, she points out, so one of 
the major Jackson constituencies was still too young to vote in 1988. They 
will, however, be of age in 1992. The many on-the-campaign-trail anecdotes make 
clear Jackson's ear for a good line, witness his immediate adoption of the 
statement from a Klansman turned Jackson supporter: "I just don't want to be on 
the wrong side of history again." 
</P>
<P>
Colton also examines issues over Jackson's history that came up during the 
campaign: his disingenuous account of his reason for leaving the University of 
Illinois; his heavy-handed negotiating on behalf of PUSH to establish 
"covenants" with corporations to hire blacks; his antisemitic remarks and 
continued association with controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis 
Farrakhan. There was also the continuing rancor over his bid for black 
leadership upon Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s death. In her explanation, Colton 
says that Jackson regrets his behavior, but manages to leave the impression 
that he mainly regrets the problems the incident caused him later. Even without 
reviving past issues, Jackson's behavior during the campaign gives rise to 
enough criticism on its own: his emphasis on loyalty over competence in his 
staff; his disinclination to relinquish control over any part of his operation; 
his reliance on a seat-of-the-pants approach; his struggle to control himself 
in relations with the press; his occasional abusiveness to members of his 
staff. There are no great revelations, however. Colton is not the first to 
suggest that Jackson's drive for power is actually pursuit of legitimacy (he 
was born out of wedlock, as he said so often during the campaign), first as 
heir to King, then with his own political organization, and finally, as 
contender for the highest office in the land. Colton makes no secret of the 
fact that she found it extremely difficult to work closely with the candidate. 
What is unclear is whether Colton seeks to temper her admiration for Jackson 
with criticism in the interest of fairness, or whether she means to warn the 
public between the lines that Jackson's volatile personality could be a 
liability in public office. Her ambivalence creates a curiously opaque account.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE UNOPPOSITE SEX BY ELISABETH BADINTER TRANSLATED BY 
BARBARA WRIGHT (HARPER &amp; ROW: $22.50; 304 PP.)

<P>
In this book covering the history of all humanity, Elisabeth Badinter draws 
upon anthropology, paleontology, primate studies, history, classics and 
literature to weave a narrative describing how the sexes are by nature 
complementary. For 4,000 years, she argues, this complementarity has been 
skewed by masculine domination, but this situation is now shifting and coming 
into balance. 
</P>
<P>
Badinter begins by asserting that among hunters and gatherers women were by no 
means inferior. Men of the Paleolithic were well aware of the complementarity 
of the sexes, she claims -- after all, it was women who invented agriculture -- 
but the complementarity became obscured by a subsequent ideological revolution. 
</P>
<P>
One of Badinter's underlying theses is that we are all bisexual. She writes 
that Adam's rib is the equivalent of the maternal womb. Therefore, if God is 
Eve's creator, Adam is her mother, or a kind of mother/father. To support this 
view, she draws on a series of Harvard studies of infants, which demonstrate 
the similarity of male and female fantasies about giving birth. The author does 
not neglect the realm of psychoanalysis, citing those analysts who depart from 
Freud in focusing on the problems in the acquisition of masculine (rather than 
feminine) identity; they see the male as forever beset by fears of maternal 
omnipotence. Badinter is convinced that we are now in the throes of a profound 
revolution ushering in what she calls "bisexual humanity." "The equality which 
is now coming about," she writes in this book which was long on the French 
bestseller list, "engenders a resemblance (between the sexes) which puts an end 
to this war. Now that the protagonists like to think of themselves as the 
'whole' of humanity, each side is in a better position to understand the Other 
. . . . We may perhaps lose something of our passion and desire thereby, but we 
shall gain the sort of tenderness and cooperation that can unite the members of 
a single family." To marshal such vast quantities of information in a human 
panorama of such scope is something of a feat; even when the style goes flat, 
the facts keep coming. Not that the facts are uninteresting. But because of the 
alacrity with which various topics are treated, one is reminded of the remark 
of a medieval monk: With a pen one can write anything one pleases.

FENDING OFF LOVE;

<P>
SAILING TO CORINTH STORIES BY IRENE WANNER (OWL CREEK PRESS, DISTRIBUTED BY 
KAMPMAN &amp; CO.: $15.95; 235 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Heeger, Heeger is an editor and fiction writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
A fat girl in a blue jogging suit; an ex-football star in a Ferrari; husbands, 
wives, students, waitresses, professors -- everyone in Irene Wanner's world is 
on the run. Consumed by want, fearing commitment, expecting disappointment, 
they hit the road, or the bottle or the sheets, with whoever turns up for the 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
If they don't bolt, they dream about it constantly. In "Ozzie and Harriet," a 
woman caught up in home-buying with a lover finds relief remembering herself 
younger, unencumbered. The narrator of "The Blue Bear," trapped in a hated job, 
doodles letters of resignation while swapping phone chat with her parents. 
</P>
<P>
A crisp, no-frills writer with an ear for everyday speech, Wanner, recipient of 
a 1988 Western States Book Award, understands how even lonely hearts fend off 
love. She knows how parents and children miscommunicate, how married life, 
breaking down, can seesaw between guilt and retribution. 
</P>
<P>
What she isn't as clear on, along with many of her characters, is what to do 
about these things. Given to neat, TV-style resolutions, she bypasses the 
quieter illuminations that are often the payoffs of great stories. 
</P>
<P>
In "Red Light Returning," one of Wanner's best, a complex look at a fraying 
marriage is marred by an end that solves everything with one kiss-and-make-up 
conversation. Elsewhere, closing statements stand in for missing drama. 
</P>
<P>
"I have learned that a man can leave his home and manage to keep things that 
matter," says a runaway husband unconvincingly, after a non-encounter with a 
pretty hitchhiker. And, "I understand much more. I see . . . you so clearly," a 
traveling wife writes just as cryptically to the husband she has regaled for 
weeks with impersonal food, weather and tour-group details. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the trouble lies with the characters themselves. With a few exceptions, 
they are concepts more than fleshed-out human beings -- a coarse but 
good-hearted waitress, a wife in search of independence, a husband tired of 
being nagged. Since they lack nuance and depth, it's hard to predict what they 
will do next, much less expect from them the kind of subtle shifts in 
perception that a short story depends on. 
</P>
<P>
Where they come alive, if they do, is in their speech. Here, under the guise of 
idle talk, the narrator of "The Blue Bear" takes a swipe at her dieting mother: 
</P>
<P>
" 'What are you planning to do today?' mother asks. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Oh, I don't know. You?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Our walk,' my father says. 'We'll probably go to the Williamsburg library 
and up to the cafeteria for coffee.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'You mean pie,' I say." 
</P>
<P>
More problematic for Wanner is maintaining dramatic focus. Once she sets an 
action up, she often falters on the follow-through. In "The Dancing Dinosaur 
Diner," a story reminiscent of country music, she lets a beat-up ex-cowboy who 
wears Lone Ranger garb for a car sales job foil a robbery at his lover's diner. 
Though he triumphs with his toy Colts, the moment dissipates as he, his lover 
and her husband sit down to breakfast and platitudes -- "It's time to move on. 
. . . A man can fool himself just so long." 
</P>
<P>
In her finest story, Wanner displays a subtler hand and a patience for 
unfolding time that promises more than her first book delivers. "You Are Here" 
-- in which a car accident illuminates the private lives of neighbors -- is a 
meditation on adult confusion between longing and reality. The richness of the 
story indicates what's to come once Wanner's style, themes and the right 
subject matter come together -- writing with much to say on the mixed grace of 
being human.

How many times have parents wished they could snap their spoiled children into 
a Third-World country to show them life without Nintendos, Reeboks and frozen 
yogurt! Kids don't have to leave America, however, to see poverty or life 
styles vastly different from their own. If they were to travel along old 
Highway 42 in east Tennessee and stop for burgers near Cook's Holler, they 
might overhear an opinion on Granddaddy's horse or the junkyard auctions on 
Friday nights. These rural opinions and others are recorded in Stories I Ain't 
Told Nobody Yet, a collection of 49 monologues and dialogues from the 
Appalachia regions. In her preface, author Jo Carson explains that she 
practices "being invisible" so she can hear the heart of people as they speak. 
</P>
<P>
The result is heartfelt poems that, when read aloud, are nearly as rich as 
eavesdropping on the folks themselves. Most of these poems would be fun for 
kids to perform as skits. There's the couple who courted for four decades, 
waiting for a disapproving mother to die; wedding advice; a battered wife; 
neighbor complaints, and observations on tourists. An old-timer reflects: 
</P>
<P>
 "And then I think 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up here, 
</P>
<P>
 worked here, 
</P>
<P>
 and I have made all my decisions 
</P>
<P>
 about here and for here, 
</P>
<P>
 and in those many moments 
</P>
<P>
 I have kept my family together 
</P>
<P>
 and in health, 
</P>
<P>
 I have lived in harmony and good 
</P>
<P>
 union 
</P>
<P>
 with my friends and neighbors 
</P>
<P>
 and I have kept 
</P>
<P>
 a piece of earth 
</P>
<P>
 in working order. 
</P>
<P>
 I am proud of that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dissidents, by Los Angeles author Neal Shusterman, is an excellent glimpse of 
life on the other side of the globe. Fresh from Chicago, 15-year-old Derek 
Ferretti experiences prime-time culture shock in Moscow as the son of the U.S. 
ambassador to the Soviet Union. One of Derek's first discoveries is that it is 
terribly uncool to dribble his basketball through Red Square and bounce it off 
the statue of Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
There are other problems. Derek is ostracized by his classmates at the 
Anglo-American School. His mother is unaffectionate and, because she is the 
ambassador, she is too frazzled to help him adjust. Derek's bodyguard is like 
having "Darth Vader as a babysitter." Above all, Derek is grieving for his dad 
who was recently killed in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Derek meets Anna, the daughter of the famous dissident Yuri Shafiroff, and 
life takes on new meaning. While he helps smuggle her out of Moscow, he 
accidently tumbles off the train and wanders into the deserted remains of 
Chernobyl. Alone and horrified, he comes to terms with himself and, finally, 
his father's death. 
</P>
<P>
Shusterman writes well. Contrasts between the United States and Soviet Union 
are wonderfully descriptive, from political twists to the perils of playing 
basketball on cobblestones. Some passages could have been shortened but that is 
a minor quibble. Derek's struggles, even his rebellion, make him likeable. 
After all, "(h)e was fifteen -- he could still get away with being obnoxious." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the States, 17-year-old Brogan Arthur explores feminist ideals and 
nearly drives her friends and family nuts with all the analyzing she does. Let 
Me Tell You Everything: Memoirs of a Lovesick Intellectual is a delight. Author 
Barbara Bottner, also of Los Angeles, has a winner. 
</P>
<P>
One warning: Readers who are used to sitcom plots better pull out their 
dictionaries and thinking caps. Brogan is not an ordinary teen and she is not 
easy on her audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans are pleasure addicts," she begins. How can she worry about 
waistlines and manicures when there are people starving in the world? Then 
there's male dominance. "That's why there have been so few woman artists, 
writers, and philosophers throughout history -- women were busy being loved by 
men who were those things, but they didn't have the courage or the vision or 
the child care to be those things themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Brogan has a terrific mind. She digests ideas while her friends diet. She 
expounds while her friends shop. Her head expands from books, not a blowdryer. 
So how can she compromise when she falls in love with her social studies 
teacher? Instead of planning for college, she now wants to primp for Mr. Price. 
"Was Gloria Steinem like this, opinionated and impassioned until you got her 
into a department store. Did she suddenly defect into Victoria Principal the 
minute you put something trendy in her hands?" 
</P>
<P>
Brogan's ability to laugh at herself makes her erudition bearable. "Memoirs" 
isn't quick reading but it is worth every thought-provoking pause.

THE MISOGYNY OF IMPRESSIONISM; 
</P>
<P>
UTRILLO'S MOTHER BY SARAH BAYLIS (RUTGERS PRESS: $19.95; 246 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Heather Meredith Keeve, Keeve is the associate publisher of ZOOM, The 
International Image Magazine. She lives and works in Paris. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I've always been a liar -- it runs in my family," begins Sarah Baylis' 
brilliant and biting novel, "Utrillo's Mother." Capturing our attention and 
imagination while failing speculation as to the veracity of her story, Baylis 
recounts in a series of flashbacks a fictionalized biography of 
Marie-Clementine (Suzanne) Valadon (1865/7-1938). 
</P>
<P>
The mother of Utrillo, she was a talented post-Impressionist artist in a period 
when the art world was experiencing tremendous growth and upheaval, though it 
remained almost exclusively a male domain. 
</P>
<P>
Baylis writes about art and politics, women and sex, oppression, freedom, 
self-expression and social stigma from an ardently feminist perspective. Her 
vision is frank and refreshing, sparing neither the sacred cows of 
Impressionism nor our preconceptions of their world as portrayed in their 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Baylis' protagonist is brash. She acts without regret or apology. She sells 
herself time and again, yet survives on her own terms. We may blush at her 
audacious conduct but admire her courage and conviction. Her desire to paint, 
to draw, to be an artist overwhelms all else. She sleeps with artists to learn 
their technique, models for others to steal tubes of paint or drawing pads. 
</P>
<P>
The novel is multidimensional. Political and social events helped to inspire 
the new art and bring on the rejection of the standards of the Academie des 
Beaux Arts. Turn-of-the-century artists were caught up in the spirit of 
revolution which led them to strike out in new directions and experiment with 
new ideas: Impressionism, Pointillism, Symbolism. Much of the descriptive 
narrative involves the events of the revolution of 1860, the Paris Commune, the 
Prussian War, the turn-of-the-century Parisian cafe society. Baylis gives us 
characters which bring to life the period: the beautiful baker's daughter who 
paints slogans, the lesbian waitress who introduces Valadon to the seedy 
underground. Baylis' descriptions are luscious and earthy, giving us not only 
sights and sounds but the odors and the emotional fervor of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
This historical context is equally important in establishing the role of women, 
and thus the basis for Valadon's outrage at the injustice she suffers. Baylis 
gives a brutal description of the lives of the working-class women of the time 
-- their backbreaking menial work, their constant fear of starvation and 
poverty, the very hopelessness of their plight. 
</P>
<P>
It is with this reference point that Baylis critiques so strongly Watteau, 
Fragonard, Renoir and other artists in their rose-tinted portrayals of 
shepherdesses and washerwomen: "Washerwomen were the rage. . . . Contemptible 
in real life, they were now almost respectable in fine art . . . but where 
slavery exists in a civilized society it must be quickly romanticized, or else 
there will be complaints, petitions, fuss and bother . . . and we'll all be 
waiting until domesday for our collars and cuffs. The same painted tradition 
that had transformed the shepherdess from a dung-smeared illiterate into a 
beribboned picnicker changed the lowly washerwoman from a tippler to a giggling 
cutie." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, on another level, the novel is atemporal. Valadon's feelings are too real, 
too natural: We identify too easily with her fantasies and with her struggle. 
Questions of sexual politics, of woman's role in society -- these are questions 
that are valid today in our society. 
</P>
<P>
The story begins with Valadon as an old woman, looking back on her childhood on 
a farm where she lived with her mother, Madeleine. Her mother is called 
Madeleine throughout the book, possibly indicating the tense and angry nature 
of the mother/daughter relationship: "We were tied together by poverty and 
kinship, hating both and loathing each other, eaten up by love and guilt." 
</P>
<P>
The farm is described in detail, a dark and dirty place seen through the eyes 
of an unhappy child. In one episode, there is an encounter with a Gypsy, and we 
see immediately the scene through the eyes of the artist: "I wish I could have 
painted her like that -- I would have made her green brown, then outlined her 
hands with a strong black line and all the colours of her clothes would be rich 
and sombre against the turbulent grass." 
</P>
<P>
Having revolted against her insulting and obnoxious employer, Madeleine is 
forced to leave, and with child in tow, heads for the city, hoping to improve 
her lot. Their lot does not improve. Madeleine finds another menial job and 
sends Valadon off to a convent school: "The place reeked of suppressed sex and 
the girls were infected by it. We were the most obscene creatures; pornography 
was scrawled on the toilet walls and swear words, picked up from our brothers 
and fathers were the cornerstone of our language -- alongside that 
cannibalistic butcherspeak that religious people use." 
</P>
<P>
After the convent, Valadon holds a series of jobs -- in a hat factory, then in 
a restaurant where she becomes a waitress and a pickpocket: "I loved thieving, 
it was my chief satisfaction. They had so much it wouldn't be missed. They were 
rich old cows in fancy hats and fox furs, who despised me. They deserved to be 
inconvenienced." 
</P>
<P>
After the restaurant, a vegetable stand, then, taking a 50-year-old clown as 
her lover, a job with the circus. It is at the circus that she meets Theo, her 
first artist, and she becomes involved with him and his world, learning from 
his work and eventually becoming a model. She models for Renoir and Chavannes, 
all the while drawing and painting furiously on her own. The transition from 
model to artist of some renown is gradual. She meets Degas, whom she considers 
brilliant: "He was called a misogynist, too. If a painter portrays a woman as 
she is, that painter will be called a misogynist, a hater of women. 
</P>
<P>
For to portray women with truthfulness is to suggest that you accept them as 
they are, and that is the most dangerous thing you can do in the world. Just 
think of it! If women are ever accepted as they are -- exhausted, possessed, 
angry and bartered . . . then the world will have to change in every single 
particle." Valadon ignores the critics and continues her art but is finally 
betrayed by her femininity -- she gets pregnant and the son she bears marks 
forever her destiny: "Never encourage your son to pick up a brush and dabble 
with painting, within a few months they'll say he has outstripped you . . . 
they'll do anything to hold a woman back, even use her poor drunken son to 
betray her. . . . Christ, it's hurtful this endless punishment of being mother 
to a painter." There are more liaisons -- a banker, a painter, and eventually 
some fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Although today she is recognized as a gifted artist, a modern reference book 
refers to Valadon's work as "violent." If this be the case, certainly Baylis 
has created a biography that would explain the violent nature of her work. More 
important, Baylis' rich prose brings to life a vibrant and impassioned 
character -- a character whose ideas are as truthful and vital in 1989 as they 
were 100 years ago.

Wives have assorted ways of handling infidelity. Some fight; others flee, and 
then there are those who fashion personalized permutations of either extreme. 
"Moon Passage," a sublimely written and deeply satisfying first novel, is the 
story of how one wife deals with her husband's chronic infidelity: Anne Ellis 
sequesters herself in a magnificent stone house overlooking a craggy but 
picturesque bluff on the Mendocino coast and tends her vegetable garden. 
Literally. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who would quarrel with her coping mechanism, but it seems to 
serve her well -- preserving her sanity by focusing on the vegetables, the 
vistas and her solitary flashback reveries of all those happier days when the 
marriage was new and the children were small. Thus armed, she's more than a 
match for the occasional discarded lovers who hike to her doorstep, curious to 
meet her husband's muse, "the anima made flesh," as one of them describes her. 
</P>
<P>
That is to say, she is more than a match for all but one. Of course, Anne does 
not know this the morning that Ellen trudges over the hill toward the house: 
"The sway of her steps falters . . . It has hit her how difficult it will be to 
say, 'I have slept with your husband, and I just wanted to see you.' She 
expects emotional fireworks . . . or she wouldn't be here. But at the same 
time, she is a little afraid and, oddly, embarrassed. She can't imagine how to 
break the news. It's hard to understand that you're doing something that's been 
done before, and that you are perfectly obvious to those with more experience." 
</P>
<P>
The scene is thus set for this rich and resonant character study of two women 
in love, two women who meet as antagonists, although neither has the prize at 
the moment. Successful author that he is, Jeff is off again, giving yet another 
writing seminar -- and picking up yet another young, adoring fan for yet 
another brief dalliance. 
</P>
<P>
How a cool and in-control wife and a confused and still-consumed discarded 
lover cut through the hostility, the suspicion and the fear that fuel their 
emotions when they first meet are the pungent ingredients of this 
thought-provoking and beautifully wrought tale that should provide wise lessons 
in loving under unsettling circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
In one of her revealing interior reveries, Anne tries to rationalize and 
justify her situation: "Why had I thought my life would be a fairy tale when I 
had deliberately, insistently, sought intensity? Hadn't I refused the nice 
commonplace men who had now and then pursued me? I wanted an extraordinary man, 
wanted my life to be like a meteor smearing the sky. My friends admired my 
ambitions. None of them had the courage, or perhaps the insight, to point out 
that the meteor is burning away." 
</P>
<P>
The young and unsubtle Ellen, only 20 and not on familiar terms with 
reflection, probes Anne for scraps of what Jeff is like and what the marriage 
has been like, hungry for anything she's willing to share, determined to make a 
collection of events she'd never shared. And Anne, after initial hesitation and 
unfamiliar irritation, finds a quirky sort of satisfaction in tossing out these 
little scenes of young married life, filling Ellen's empty emotional plate. 
</P>
<P>
But throbbing through the book like a patient pulse is the theme of adjustment 
to betrayal. Is Anne wrong to "indulge" her seldom-seen husband, grateful for 
his occasional attention? Is Ellen wrong to be so outraged that she consciously 
invades Anne's refuge in search of answers? Can two women at different stages 
of life and with different levels of passion discover any common ground? Can 
they comfort each other? Should they? 
</P>
<P>
Which introduces the reader to yet another, less transparent but no less 
meaningful theme: the inherent nature of the feminine -- the capacity to feel 
deeply, the proclivity for compassion and the access to reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
"Moon Passage" is a telling exploration of the female psyche recorded by a 
skillful traveler who already knows the terrain. As such, women readers will 
find it a very rewarding journey.

Patrick Suskind's second novel focuses on 24 hours in the life of Jonathan 
Noel, an isolated, alienated Parisian bank guard who makes Camus' Mersault seem 
like a glad-hander. Noel's remote existence is so meticulously ordered that the 
unexpected appearance of an ordinary pigeon in the hallway of his rooming house 
plunges him into a crisis of despair and doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Like Job -- to whom he would probably compare himself -- Noel receives a rebuke 
from On High. A distant peal of thunder replaces the Voice Out of the 
Whirlwind, reminding him of his humanity and the need for companionship. 
Grotesque, funny and often moving, this brief book is warmer and more affirming 
than Suskind's celebrated first novel, "Perfume."

ENDPAPERS: 'SLEPT THROUGH ANY POETRY LATELY?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MILES, Times Book Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Slept through any poetry lately?" The question is a headline in the July issue 
of "The Write Stuff," the newsletter of the Pomona Valley Writers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Poetry haters? On the contrary, poetry devotees of an indefatigable ardor, 
sleeping only as lovers sleep, with slaked passion. The PVWA is sponsoring a 
40-hour weekend workshop in the mountains near Green Valley Lake, an "endurance 
experience for poetry lovers," including "round-the-clock readings (for the 
mind); food, fresh air &amp; exercise (for the body); and an intimate, 
inspirational setting &amp; time to create (for the soul)." "Plan to 
participate/present/produce!" members are exhorted, but a warning follows: 
"Maximum occupancy -- 20 poets." 
</P>
<P>
I dream of being the Green Valley Lake hotelier whose job it is to enforce 
maximum occupancy against the 21st poet: "Sorry, ma'am, it's the fire code. 
Just doing my job." Far be it from me, however, to gainsay round-the-clock 
poetry reading for those tough enough to take it. If marathon therapy can break 
down neuroses, maybe marathon poetry reading can break down writer's block. 
</P>
<P>
Poetry therapy in the strict sense (if strict is the right word) is thriving in 
Southern California. Perhaps for kindred reasons, so is actors' poetry, or 
actors' poetry therapy. In my experience, actors are never happier than when 
they see the psychic agony of a fellow actor bleeding through into the 
performance. Cafe Largo, the actors' poetry night club, struck me on my one 
visit to it as a cross between equity waiver and psychiatric grand rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Still, what all these forms of nouvelle poesie have in common is important. 
They are all group experiences and as such a part of a multifaceted shift to 
performance in all of American arts and letters. And that shift is no joke: 
Henry M. Sayre's "The Object of Performance: The American Avant-Garde Since 
1970" (University of Chicago Press) claims that this shift defines the new 
avant-garde. In the visual arts, Sayre sees a move away from exhibition toward 
mixed-media performance. In poetry, the analogous move would be away from print 
to -- well, stick around: We're finding out. 
</P>
<P>
The two shifts have points of direct contact. Reviewer George Leonard writes 
(Book Review, July 16) of a pioneering performance, Yvonne Rainer's 1962 
"Ordinary Dance," which was "a collage of pure dance movements and observed 
behavior." "Instead of music, Rainer spoke 'an autobiographical narrative' as 
she danced. Her 'dance' was itself often a mimicking of everyday motions, even 
facial expressions, that she'd observed in the subway." Leonard muses: "Should 
we call that dance or mime? 'Dance-supported confessional prose poetry'? " 
</P>
<P>
How about cartoon? I ask, thinking of Jules Feiffer, who has been drawing 
something like dance-supported confessional prose poetry for 25 years -- 
laughing at it but, clearly, enormously and lastingly struck by it. Both the 
comedy and the pathos of Feiffer's dancer -- in her black leotard, with her 
swooping hair -- is that she is a woman. Imagine a man in all those cartoons, 
and the effect, simultaneously poignant and funny, evaporates. In this, Henry 
Sayre would find only confirmation since he maintains that the new performance 
art has been female in no small measure because women have been excluded from 
mainstream art galleries. 
</P>
<P>
Women are also notable by their relative absence from John Ashbery and David 
Lehman's confidently titled "Best Poems of 1988," reviewer Ian Gregson notes 
today on Page 3, in the first part of a six-part Summer Poetry Series, a series 
we hope to make an annual feature of the Book Review. Also missing from that 
volume, Gregson says, is another element that Sayre finds prominent in the new 
performance art; namely, politics or what Gregson calls simply realism. The 
poets that Ashbery selects wouldn't be likely to write about abortion, for 
example. By the same token, the mainstream New York galleries that Sayre 
surveys wouldn't be likely to exhibit paintings on abortion. So what do the 
women do? They put on their ballet slippers and vote with their feet: "A Dance 
to John Rehnquist." (Jules, are you taking notes?) 
</P>
<P>
At the popular level, in America's television culture, the shift to performance 
may have taken place a generation ago. But poetry and painting are among our 
oldest, most durable and most conservative forms. We should expect them to be 
among the last to be, as Marshall McLuhan put it, tribalized. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, however, they may well tribalize -- or re-tribalize -- more 
easily than fiction, a younger but intrinsically more private form. Most 
fiction is, to begin with, simply too long to perform. Do I hear you cry 
"Nicholas Nickleby!"? A fair objection, but "Nicholas Nickleby" was a unique 
effort, scarcely the start of a movement. Poetry readings -- thousands of them, 
all year long, all over the country -- do constitute a movement. And the shift 
to more elaborately mounted "literary" performance carries the movement a step 
further. 
</P>
<P>
Hitherto, the great strength of fiction was that it contained its own set, 
lights, sound, special effects within itself. A play written with such 
completeness would foil its own performance: It would render actors, director, 
etc., superfluous. A lyric poem written at such length, given the demanding 
intensity of lyric language, would be murderous. Once the shift to performance 
begins, however, the relative incompleteness of lyric and drama become a more 
crucial strength than ever and, by the same token, the completeness of fiction 
becomes a weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Of Michael Palmer, winner of this year's PEN USA Center West poetry prize, 
critic Norman Finkelstein has written -- with admiration -- that he is "that 
rarity, a major poet who is almost totally unreadable." Totally unreadable? The 
compliment reads like an insult. But recall that many fine plays are 
essentially unreadable. We don't care because unreadable, spoken of a play, 
does not mean unperformable. If the play is any good, unreadable may mean 
simply incomplete in the right way. Palmer is incomplete in a poet's, not a 
playwright's, way, but his incompleteness nonetheless is compatible with 
performance in a way that would scarcely be true of any fiction. You can 
rewrite a novella or a short story for the stage. But, if you wanted, you could 
choreograph a Palmer poem as written. And the step from poetry that may be 
performed to poetry that must be performed -- poetry whose printed version is 
only a kind of prompt -- may be smaller than it seems. 
</P>
<P>
Novelists relish solitude and control. They write for readers like themselves, 
readers who rejoice in the compact package that provides all they need for a 
rich intellectual, emotional, deliciously private experience. If you are that 
kind of person, the shift to performance may strip your gears. But the 20 poets 
reading round the clock -- and apparently eating, jogging and generally 
rusticating together as well -- may not be quite like you. Neither may be the 
actors gathered of a night at Cafe Largo -- and otherwise not given to the 
sessions of sweet silent page-turning. (No insult here. See Page 3: Ashbery 
doesn't read either.) 
</P>
<P>
The promise of a shift to performance in painting and poetry is the promise of 
an infusion of energy and relevance. The threat in it is the threat that all 
artists will be busted to set-designer and all writers to scriptwriter. The 
situation is deeply ambiguous, so much so that if poetry is alive and well in 
Los Angeles, the performance capital of the world, we do right to wonder 
whether it is Los Angeles or poetry that has changed more. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, as the Book Review has continued to publish a poem 
each week while cutting back on the number of poetry reviews, one distinguished 
poet who has written in support is Donald Hall, winner of the 1988 National 
Book Critics Circle poetry prize for "The One Day," a book-length poem that 
successfully defied excerpting in our little poetry box and may well have 
resisted public reading by its own author. No surprise here: Hall has publicly 
decried the spread of what he calls "McPoetry"; that is, light, brief, often 
wry poems written, consciously or unconsciously, with public reading in mind. 
Though he has, to be sure, written short poems that read beautifully and even a 
children's book, "The Ox-Cart Man," that reads beautifully again and again (the 
kid test), Hall is more aware than most of what can be lost by the shift to 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
And yet the gains may be real too. T. S. Eliot had a way of reading his own 
poetry that seemed to constrict his windpipe to about 12 picas' diameter. The 
result was, to push the metaphor, that you could hear every kern and serif. And 
too many poets, even now, seem to take Eliot as their public-speaking model. 
When you begin with a poem that, as to its content, reads like a philosophy 
lecture heard by a sleeping student (see Gregson, Page 3), the Eliot tradition 
of public reading may induce terminal narcolepsy. 
</P>
<P>
No one falls asleep at Cafe Largo, thank God for actors, and I venture to say 
that the PVWA 20 won't drowse away their 40 hours either. If we're lucky, the 
shift to performance will, by degrees, bring the vigor of song, chants ("We 
Will Ree Lee Rock-You!"), cheers, slang, slogans and related oral stimuli back 
into poetic play. If we're unlucky, however, the same shift may frustrate the 
long strenuous coupling that perhaps alone can bring a serious reader into 
intimacy and then identity with the mind of a great artist. That secret 
struggle, I confess, is more my own way, and I prize most those who prize (and 
preserve) it as a cultural habit. But we know, don't we, in what city and what 
century we find ourselves.

GORBACHEV VOWS SWIFT PURGE OF HARD-LINE FOES

<P>
Faced with worsening ethnic and labor unrest, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
appeared Friday to be turning to new and more radical tactics in his struggle 
to reform the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to regional Communist Party leaders published in Friday's issue of 
Pravda, Gorbachev made his strongest attack yet on the party conservatives he 
accuses of frustrating his policy of perestroika, or restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
"The ranks of party officials need an infusion of fresh blood," Gorbachev said, 
emphasizing that the renewal is required "at all levels" from basic party 
organizations up through the 13-man ruling Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strikes a Factor in Decision 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a member of Gorbachev's inner circle of economic advisers confirmed 
in an interview that strikes by Soviet coal miners were a factor in Gorbachev's 
announcement, at the same party conference, of plans to import consumer goods 
valued at 10 billion rubles -- $16 billion at the official rate of exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision to import consumer goods definitely was speeded up by the 
strikes, although discussions on the subject were under way a long time ago," 
said Nikolai Y. Petrakov, deputy director of the Central Institute of 
Mathematical-Economic Research and a deputy in the newly reconstituted 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The reputedly stormy party meeting was held earlier this week, but Gorbachev's 
remarks were not made public until Friday. His implied threat to purge 
conservatives from the party, as well as the decision to import consumer goods, 
represents a shift from what has been his relatively cautious program of 
domestic reform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Aims for Balance 
</P>
<P>
For all the apparent daring of many of his foreign policy moves and the 
attention-grabbing candor of his glasnost, or openness, in discussing failings 
at home, Gorbachev has generally been careful to strike a balance between those 
he says want to reform too fast and those who want no reform at all. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe that a flurry of ethnic conflicts and, even more 
important, the coal strikes that began earlier this month may have spurred him 
to bolder action. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as five months ago, Gorbachev had resisted proposals to increase 
imports of consumer goods, arguing that it would be better in the long run to 
spend the money on machinery to make consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve days ago, however, shortages of everything from tea and butter to shoes 
and television sets were high on the list of complaints when Siberian coal 
miners walked off their jobs. The strikes spread and at their peak are believed 
to have shut down as much as a third of the country's daily coal production. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, most Siberian mines were reportedly operating normally after a 
high-level government commission agreed to a 35-point plan including 
significant increases in supplies of consumer goods in the Kuznets region, 
where the strike was centered. 
</P>
<P>
Petrakov, the research institute official, said that such strikes were not 
surprising and that they could spread to other industries. 
</P>
<P>
"The demands presented do not relate to miners alone," he said. "Shortages of 
consumer goods are pervasive, and very difficult working conditions are 
widespread. The only way to avert this spreading of strikes is to finally face 
the real needs of the people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Of Crucial Importance' 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that this cannot be accomplished overnight, but he said it is 
"important for people to feel that an improvement of their situation is under 
way." 
</P>
<P>
"This is of crucial importance to stabilize the social tension in the country," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev told the party conference that eliminating shortages of consumer 
goods is an "especially pressing" task. 
</P>
<P>
"All the resources inside the country are being used," he said. "And beyond 
that, opportunities have been found to replenish the market through imports 
totaling about 10 billion rubles." 
</P>
<P>
The coal strikes, which the official news media said were continuing Friday in 
the Ukraine and other areas of the European part of the Soviet Union, were also 
directed at local party and government officials accused by the miners of being 
insensitive to their needs. These bureaucrats are the same people Gorbachev 
blames for frustrating his effort to make the Soviet system more efficient by 
decentralizing it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Economic and Legal Autonomy' 
</P>
<P>
Tass reported Friday that the 35-point agreement with Siberian miners says the 
mines "will receive full economic and legal autonomy" and that "the existing 
production amalgamations, with their top-heavy management structure, will be 
replaced by associations or other voluntary forms of organizing coal mining." 
</P>
<P>
Miners also are to get the authority, beginning Aug. 1, "to set their own norms 
of production, pay rates and some other indices," Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said at the party meeting that party bureaucrats are holding back the 
perestroika program rather than leading it. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone still has it in his mind that this worsening situation . . . can be 
controlled through reliance on old methods and approaches, he falls into the 
most profound delusion," he warned. 
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that he now sees the primary danger to his program as coming 
from "conservative and dogmatic forces," rather than from those who are 
pressing for more daring reform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leningrad Leaders Removed 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's call for "an infusion of fresh blood" in the party followed by only 
a week a visit to Leningrad, where he presided over the removal of one of the 
country's most powerful party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Former Leningrad party chief Yuri F. Solovyov, who is a non-voting candidate 
member of the Politburo, was defeated, along with most of his fellow city party 
leaders, in last spring's national elections for the new Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Removing Solovyov, a Western diplomat commented, "signaled that (Gorbachev's) 
patience with local officials who don't implement perestroika and solve local 
problems has run out." Now, the diplomat said, it seems likely that he will use 
the disaffection showed by the strikes to purge the party of more dead wood.

Costa Rica has barred former White House aide Oliver L. North and former U.S. 
National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter from entering its territory after 
a yearlong parliamentary probe into arms and drugs smuggling, Information 
Minister Jorge Urbina said in San Jose, the nation's capital. Also banned from 
the country were ex-U.S. Ambassador Lewis A. Tambs, arms dealer Richard V. 
Secord and former CIA Costa Rica station chief Joseph F. Fernandez, Urbina 
said. A lower house committee said it believed they were in some way involved 
in arms and drug smuggling, but gave no specific evidence.

Police arrested 109 anti-abortion demonstrators for blocking the entrance to a 
Planned Parenthood clinic in Salinas, although officers said the protest was 
generally peaceful. Those arrested were taking part in one of a series of 
Operation Rescue demonstrations that have been staged in recent months 
throughout the country. Police Lt. Scott Miller said the demonstrators were 
charged with misdemeanor counts of trespassing and resisting officers. Some of 
those taken into custody were "uncooperative in the booking process," Miller 
said. They refused to identify themselves, be photographed or fingerprinted. 
Miller said they will remain in jail.

A 17-year-old San Jose boy accused of killing a male sexual partner in a rage 
of guilt will stand trial as a juvenile rather than as an adult, according to a 
ruling by Juvenile Court Judge John T. Ball. If convicted, Joaquin Ocasio would 
face less prison time under Juvenile Court requirements than he would face in 
the adult court system. The judge said he based his decision in part on 
evidence that showed the boy had been seduced by the stabbing victim, Kevin 
Beaird, 34. Prosecutors said the youth had "rage reactions." The decision to 
try Ocasio as a juvenile was criticized by Cynthia Goldstein, a Bay Area gay 
activist, who said "The court's ruling signifies that it's not serious if you 
kill a gay person, as opposed to a non-gay person."

TIAN AN MEN SQUARE; 
</P>
<P>
IN THE TRADITIONAL VIEW IT IS CENTER OF BEIJING, CHINA AND THE UNIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For Chinese citizens, few places mean as much, in history or in symbol, as the 
Gate of Heavenly Peace (Tian An Men), the massive vermilion wall that guards 
the southern entrance to Beijing's Forbidden City. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds and perhaps thousands of protesting students died in the shadow of the 
gate early in June, before the tanks and rifles of the 27th Army. It was no 
accident the youths chose Tian An Men Square, which lies before the gate, as 
their stage. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the creation of Communist China 40 years ago, Tian An Men was known 
as the place where government and the governed met. After the Ming emperors 
built their capital at Beijing in the early 15th Century, Tian An Men became 
the focus of the dynasty's most elaborate public ceremony, "The Gold Phoenix 
Issues an Edict," in which court officials announced imperial policy from a 
rostrum on the gate, long before written copies of the mandate were conveyed to 
the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
The emperor's benevolent power, subjects believed, flowed southward from the 
throne room, past the walled fortress of the Forbidden City, and through Tian 
An Men like a calming river that branched into the far reaches of his empire. 
</P>
<P>
When the People's Republic of China was founded Oct. 1, 1949, this was the 
place where Communist Party leader Mao Tse-tung raised the country's new flag. 
</P>
<P>
"In the traditional Chinese view, Tian An Men was not only the center of the 
capital, but the center of the country and the center of the universe," says 
Anthony J. Kane, director of the China Council of the Asia Foundation, a New 
York-based educational institution committed to the study and understanding of 
Asian culture. 
</P>
<P>
The gate remains a symbol of central authority. An image of the long, low 
building, with its sweeping roof upturned to fend off evil forces, is stamped 
on Chinese coins, currency, airline tickets, and policemen's badges. 
Schoolchildren learn to sing "I Love Tian An Men Square," much as others learn 
"America" or "La Marseillaise." 
</P>
<P>
Tian An Men Square is, at 98 acres, the largest city square in the world, a 
pancake-flat expanse of paving stones inspired by Moscow's Red Square. Tian An 
Men was created by the Communist government, which cleared away a rat's maze of 
gray houses, walls and alleys that used to squat outside the imperial compound. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tourists from the provinces flock to the square to see museums and 
monuments to the revolution and to have their pictures taken by vendors in 
front of the old gate. In normal times the atmosphere is easy, with vacationers 
gawking, licking flavored ice, and pointing at the sights, while staid Beijing 
residents drift to and from work on their black Flying Pigeon bicycles, 
accompanied by the festive tinkling of thousands upon thousands of bike bells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mao Still Haunts 
</P>
<P>
Although more than a decade has passed since Mao's death, the late chairman 
still haunts Tian An Men Square. At the plaza's south end, hundreds of the 
reverent and the curious line up daily, hats in hand, to visit the Chairman Mao 
Tse-tung Memorial Hall, a gray mausoleum built in the same heroic proportions 
as the emperor's quarters. Here the founder of modern China lies on view under 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
At Tian An Men Square's northern end, Mao's portrait peers down from Tian An 
Men Gate, where he liked to review thousands of marching Red Guards, the 
radical youths who held his little red poetry books aloft and greeted the Great 
Helmsman with a chant once reserved for emperors: "Ten thousand years! Ten 
thousand! Ten thousand and ten thousand!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Site of Testing 
</P>
<P>
Along with the worshipful, Tian An Men has also drawn the disaffected from all 
parts of China. Traditionally, the capital gates have been a forum for testing 
the limits of political speech. 
</P>
<P>
Even before there was a China, a legendary king named Yao encouraged his 
subjects to carve their criticisms of government officials on wooden pillars 
outside his palace, so he would know of commoners' concerns. The wooden columns 
are gone now, but they are recalled by two pairs of white marble huabiao that 
support the gate at Tian An Men. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps with that tradition in mind, Chinese gathered before the columns of 
Tian An Men to press the Qing emperor for reforms in government and education 
between 1895 and 1900. It was here the last dynasty collapsed in 1912 and here 
that guards shot and bayoneted 47 students to death in 1926, while the youths 
were protesting what they considered undue foreign influence in Chinese 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mao's Cultural Revolution, which began in Tian An Men, finally ended 
there. A million students poured into the capital to mourn the death of Premier 
Chou En-lai in 1976, and their mourning swiftly turned into a riot, aimed at 
the repressive Maoists then in power. Police brutally beat hundreds of the 
youths and made mass arrests, but the students eventually prevailed.

Tempers were hot and separate sets of roadblocks kept outsiders away from the 
St. Regis Indian Reservation in Upstate New York, where federal and state 
authorities had raided four gambling casinos earlier last week. About 50 state 
troopers sealed the area around the reservation, which straddles the Canadian 
border near Hogansburg, and Mohawk Indians closed the roads within the 
14,460-acre territory for a third day. "We're detouring traffic around the 
reservation because they've shut down the roads inside," said State Police Sgt. 
Michael Downs. Tribal chiefs, who have written to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo calling 
the dawn raid Thursday an "act of war," meanwhile agreed to hold a referendum 
this week on whether the reservation should continue to sponsor gambling 
activities.

FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST STORMS; 
</P>
<P>
NATION'S BARRIER ISLANDS ARE WASHING OUT TO SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chains of islands are strung like beads along America's coasts -- a barrier 
that absorbs the force of storms and shields the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
But the islands are disappearing. At least 50 barrier islands off Louisiana 
have washed away over 30 years, exposing delicate marshes and wetlands to 
direct assault by the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Line of Defense 
</P>
<P>
"Barrier islands are like your skin, the first line of defense against 
infection," said Robert E. Stewart Jr., director of the National Wetlands 
Research Center, a branch of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said: "It would be enormously expensive to restore them." 
</P>
<P>
"Something can be done, but it would be very, very expensive," echoed Jay 
Warren, a project engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers. "Not only would 
you have to restore them, but then you have to maintain them. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a study just last year that looked at barrier island maintenance as a 
way to protect marsh behind the barrier islands and also as a means to reduce 
storm surge and hurricane damage inland. Even picking up those benefits, the 
cost was just prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2,700 Miles of Islands 
</P>
<P>
Almost 2,700 miles of barrier islands protect the coasts of 18 states along the 
Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, and all of the islands are threatened. The 
West Coast has fewer barrier islands, but they also are eroding. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Island, a sliver of sand and expensive cottages just east of New York's 
Long Island, is losing beaches on both the seaward and landward sides despite 
jetties and groins (a rigid structure built out at an angle to the shore) built 
to save them. A million cubic yards of sand shift along the coasts of both Cape 
Hatteras and Cape Cod each year. 
</P>
<P>
Texas' Galveston Island has been protected by seawalls since a hurricane killed 
6,000 people in 1900. But its beach eroded after the wall was built -- the sort 
of trade-off made wherever man has moved onto the islands. 
</P>
<P>
Seawalls, jetties, groins and rocks all produce the same result: They direct 
wave action elsewhere, and the beaches wash away. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Valence is mayor of Grand Isle, Louisiana's only developed barrier island. 
A 2,000-foot section of its beach is under a state of emergency as Gulf waters 
lap at a motel's pilings and close in on state Highway 1, the only route onto 
the island. Valence wants to build protective rock jetties and estimates the 
project will cost about $422,000. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Jones, parish engineer and civil defense director for nearby Terrebonne 
Parish, predicted that the project would cost 10 times that much and would fail 
unless the rocks were given a sound foundation and provisions were made to get 
fresh sand to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless it's done right, those rocks are just going to eat themselves into the 
sand and disappear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones has earned his air of authority. Five years ago, he defied conventional 
advice and saved the eastern tip of Isle Derniere, where pounding waves were 
threatening to cut off two-thirds of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Island Resists Hurricanes 
</P>
<P>
Isle Derniere, French for Last Island, at 1,800 acres is the largest of 
Louisiana's barrier islands. Jones' repairs have withstood eight hurricanes, 
absorbing the force of tidal surges that otherwise would have hit coastal 
communities unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
Jones used all natural materials. Near the area being washed over by waves, he 
found deposits of especially coarse sand. His crews scooped that sand into a 
protective dune that topped out at 8 feet above sea level, then filled the 
holes with finer sand from the Gulf floor. 
</P>
<P>
Next, he hired students to plant sea grass to anchor the sand. "The key to 
keeping what you've got . . . on the island is vegetation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first year of its existence, it faced three hurricane surges, and it 
was completely overtopped by Hurricane Juan," Jones said. "We had a number of 
hurricanes every year since then. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survived Storm Surge 
</P>
<P>
"Hurricane Gilbert (last fall), even though it hit 500 miles away, sent a storm 
surge here that overtopped every levee in southern Terrebonne Parish. . . . The 
vegetation held up fine." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said that the best way to save the barrier islands is to put $10 million 
in trust for 10 islands, then use the interest each year to restore one. "At 
the end of 10 years, you'd go back and start over again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't think of it as a one-shot civil engineering problem. That was my 
major problem to begin with," Jones said. "I'm used to putting something up in 
concrete and five years later having it look the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I went out there after a hurricane, I was very disappointed. 
The geologists were ecstatic that it survived as well as it did."

Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. led a parade through the Johnson 
Space Center in Houston, the city whose name was the first word ever spoken on 
the moon two decades ago. "On July 20, 1969, men first stepped on the moon and 
made more than footprints in history," Aldrin told space fans at a rally beside 
what would have been Apollo 18, the giant Saturn 5 rocket whose mission was 
scuttled because of the costs of the war in Vietnam. Aldrin, minus his fellow 
moon walker of 20 years ago, Neil A. Armstrong, was one of 14 Apollo astronauts 
who attended the events commemorating the successful 1969 mission and other 
past accomplishments and looking ahead to an expanded program of space 
exploration. When the Apollo 11 crew first landed on the moon, Armstrong had 
said: "Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed."

Six people were arrested at Boston's Logan International Airport after an 
argument aboard a Continental Airlines flight from Newark, N.J., escalated into 
a fistfight in the aisles minutes before landing, police said. The pilot of 
Continental Flight 358 had to pull the DC-9 out of its landing pattern and 
circle the airport until the combatants returned to their seats. The fight, 
between a New Jersey couple and a Medford, Mass., family, resumed as the plane 
taxied to the gate around 5 p.m., officials said. State Trooper James Deyermond 
said police were unsure what provoked the argument. The suspects will face a 
variety of charges on arraignment Monday, including interfering with a flight 
crew, disorderly conduct and assaulting police officers at the gate. The New 
Jersey couple were released on $150 bond and the Medford family members were 
released on personal recognizance.

LOUISIANA INMATES BLAME UNREST ON GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
ROEMER'S STINGINESS WITH CLEMENCY HAS CREATED 'TIME BOMB,' LIFERS CLAIM

<P>
At Louisiana State Penitentiary, despair has a name: Gov. Buddy Roemer. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum-security prison, once among the nation's bloodiest, is under a 
state of emergency declared by U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola after a 
string of murders, suicides and escapes this year. Inmates blame Roemer's 
stinginess with clemency for the 4,800 men, most serving life or very nearly 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the hope of release that generates faith in the system. When an inmate 
loses faith, you have a ticking time bomb," said Ron Wikberg, who has served 21 
years of a life sentence for murdering a grocery clerk during a robbery in 
Lafayette. 
</P>
<P>
Roemer granted clemency to four people -- only one of them from Angola -- and 
approved 10 pardons from March 13, 1988, to June 23, 1989. Predecessor Edwin 
Edwards approved clemency for 42 people and 22 pardons from March 13, 1984, to 
June 23, 1985, the start of his last term in office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sentence Reduction 
</P>
<P>
Inmates accuse Roemer of going back on his word to reduce sentences fairly, 
based on merit. Under Edwards, money and political connections got inmates out 
of prison, they said. Howard Marsellus, Edwards' pardon board chairman, is now 
serving five years in prison for his role in a pardon-for-sale scandal. 
</P>
<P>
When model prisoners have no hope of release, they try to escape or kill 
themselves, Wikberg said. "Unmodel prisoners" assault or kill others. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that's the problem. That's an excuse," Roemer said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's two schools of thought," said state Department of Corrections chief 
Bruce Lynn. "One, inside the prison, says they need more clemency. The people 
on the outside say, 'No they don't.' 
</P>
<P>
"The governor's caught between a rock and a hard place." 
</P>
<P>
Prisoners cite the case of lifer Francis "Corky" Clifton, 52, who after 27 
years in prison was made a trusty, tending bloodhounds and attack dogs. But two 
months ago he ran away from the house where he lived, forfeiting the chance to 
spend the rest of his sentence free of chains and cells. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized I had a lot to lose," Clifton said after surrendering five days 
later. "To think you're going to die here, it just gets to you. It gets to 
working on your mind." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Warden Roger Thomas said: "The unwritten message from other inmates 
and employees used to be, 'If you behave yourself, in 10 or 15 or 20 years 
you're going to be able to go home.' What's happening is the long-termers 
aren't going home." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, many prisoners believe they have nothing to lose, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates want only what they have earned, said Wilbert Rideau, the editor of the 
award-winning prison magazine The Angolite. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not asking for anything special. They're asking for people to treat 
them fair. I can't imagine the average citizen having a problem with that," 
said Rideau, 47, who has served 28 years of a life sentence for slashing the 
throat of a bank teller in Lake Charles. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is he needs to grant clemency to deserving inmates. He needs 
to keep his word to prisoners," said Floyd Webb, 36, who has served nine years 
of a life sentence for a shotgun slaying in St. Tammany Parish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Television Show 
</P>
<P>
Wikberg, 46, an associate editor of The Angolite, said much of the 
dissatisfaction can be traced to an April "20-20" television show on Rideau and 
his inability to secure release. "Every inmate at Angola was watching that 
show." 
</P>
<P>
In the "20-20" piece, Roemer made his stand on clemency clear. 
</P>
<P>
Clifton said that was when he decided to flee. 
</P>
<P>
On May 1, lifer Steven Calloway Howard, 34, escaped after 10 years in prison. 
He was captured nearby three days later. 
</P>
<P>
On May 8, lifer Donald Fink, 39, tried to run off and, after warning shots, was 
wounded by guards. "I'm tired and I'm going home," long-term inmate Henry 
Patterson quoted Fink as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Angola has long had a reputation as a hard place. The state's 38 Death Row 
prisoners live here, close to "Gruesome Gertie," the electric chair used to 
execute 18 men since 1983. Eight were executed in the summer of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The 18,000-acre prison, 50 miles north of Baton Rouge, is surrounded by the 
Mississippi River on three sides and the impassable Tunica Hills on the other. 
The location is remote, accessible only by a single, winding dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the American Bar Assn. described conditions as medieval, squalid and 
horrifying. Inmates told of the "Red Hat," where unruly prisoners were kept 
naked in dark, damp dungeons and given only spoonfuls of food. There were 
reports of 70 murders in 18 years and rampant homosexuality. 
</P>

State of Emergency 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Polozola of Baton Rouge declared the prison in a state of emergency. 
Ross Maggio, called "the gangster" by inmates for his unwavering adherence to 
rules, was brought in as warden to scour away the blood and filth. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, he succeeded. Food was improved, wretched dining halls were 
cleaned, prisoners were kept busy with work in the fields and organized 
recreation. More guards were hired and given better pay. 
</P>
<P>
The prison seemed dormant for almost a decade until four murders, four 
suicides, 64 stabbings and 11 escapes in 14 months forced Polozola to declare a 
new state of emergency June 21. Another suicide occurred earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The fury at Angola is hidden behind the concertina wire. The grounds are trim 
and neat. Guard towers rise above white fences, rows of corn and herds of 
cattle. The prison camps look washed and the steel bars are painted. 
</P>
<P>
Maggio, who retired in 1984, is coming back as Polozola's court-appointed 
prison specialist, but Warden Hilton Butler remains in his job. Polozola will 
not comment about the case. 
</P>
<P>
Maggio is a nervy man. Kidnapped at knifepoint with his mother by two trusties 
in 1982, he ran his truck into the main gate, grabbed a pistol from a guard and 
unloaded it into the cab. One inmate was killed and another wounded. Doris 
Maggio, then 64, was cut by the windshield's spraying glass. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, chosen warden of the year in 1987 by the North American Assn. of 
Wardens, said Maggio isn't needed, that there is no state of emergency. What is 
needed, he said, is more guards and better pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, Butler has run Angola with a $46-million budget and 1,200 
guards. This year, budget cuts deprived guards of the $100-a-month premium for 
working in a maximum-security prison. It's been years since they had a raise. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't help inmates either, Wikberg said. "There's a ripple effect here. 
When employees are happy they treat prisoners a bit better. When they're 
demoralized, it's hard on inmates." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a situation that's ripe for anything," Webb said.

Thousands of Americans stop their normal activities once a day, head outdoors 
and officially record the weather in one of the nation's largest volunteer 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Harry U. Gibson, 83, trudged out into Idaho's record low temperatures last 
February, keeping up a tradition of never being late with his report in a 
quarter-century as an observer. 
</P>
<P>
To the south, in Red River, N.M., Robert W. Prunty is maintaining a 57-year 
family effort in volunteer weather observing. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly everyone can call themselves a weather observer, of course. 
</P>
<P>
But 11,650 Americans do it in a regular, formal system organized by the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
These records, compiled over more than a century, constitute the formal climate 
record of the United States and are used in both weather and climate 
calculations. 
</P>
<P>
The observers take readings of rainfall, temperature, river levels and other 
information, some collecting data at 7 a.m. local time, others between 5 p.m. 
and 6 p.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
Their information is compiled with readings taken at National Weather Service 
offices and by observers around the world to constitute a global climate 
network. 
</P>
<P>
NOAA annually honors its volunteer observers, selecting five for the Thomas 
Jefferson Award, named for the third President, who was an avid weather 
observer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, other volunteers are honored with the John Campanius Holm Award, 
named for the man who collected the first weather observations in Colonial 
America, between 1644 and 1645 near Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
The winners receive plaques citing their achievement. 
</P>
<P>
The Jefferson Award winners this year are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gibson, a retired farmer, until recently collected weather data in Boise 
and Kuna, Ida., for some 25 years. Going beyond his call of duty, Gibson also 
warned local farmers of sudden temperature drops that might threaten crops and 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Prunty, a retired postmaster and assistant fire chief, has also distributed 
daily weather reports at the local post office and prepares weather summaries 
for the Sangre de Cristo Chronicle in Eagle Nest, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 -- William B. Gillespie Jr., of Effingham, N.C., succeeded his father as local 
observer in 1946 to maintain a family tradition started in 1918. Gillespie has 
battled floods to gather river stage data and hasn't missed a report in 41 
years despite the pressure of also managing a general store. 
</P>
<P>
 -- John O. Nellermoe, a former rancher in Trotters, N.D., has been a 
cooperative observer for 39 years. Besides reporting on crucial aspects of soil 
moisture and temperature, he also provides emergency assistance as a spotter of 
severe storms. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Henry Cordes, of Cordes, Ariz., has been a volunteer observed for 51 years 
without missing an observation or turning in a late report. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the five volunteers receiving the Thomas Jefferson Awards, 24 
were selected for the Holm Award.

Violence in Soviet prisons and labor camps is on the rise, and there have been 
three times as many instances of hostage-taking this year as in all of 1988, 
the country's top corrections official said in an article published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Katorgin, head of the Interior Ministry's Department of Correctional 
Facilities, said there was a 28.8% increase in crimes committed at correctional 
institutions and detention centers. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, there were 48 cases of hostage-taking, which is three times more 
than the whole of 1988," Katorgin wrote in Nedelya, a weekly supplement to the 
government newspaper Izvestia. "A total of 114 guards were subjected to 
physical violence, with 14 wounded and one killed." 
</P>
<P>
He said that over the first five months of 1989, 263 inmates faced disciplinary 
or criminal charges and that there was a growing tendency toward group 
disobedience and refusal to work. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry is taking several steps to reverse the violent trend, 
such as allowing inmates to use 10% of their pay to buy food in prison shops 
and increasing the number of visits by relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Katorgin also said corrupt prison officials will be fired.

LAJES DO PICO, Azores 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Silt has built up in the harbor where whaling fleets once anchored. On shore, 
factories stand derelict. Only a few tourists sip coffee at the Moby Dick Cafe 
or wander around in the whaling museum. 
</P>
<P>
Since the international whaling ban in 1983, things have been looking bleak for 
Lajes do Pico and almost all the 250,000 people living in the Azores, the 
Atlantic archipelago about 740 miles west of mainland Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
But as a Portuguese possession, the Azores now are part of the European 
Economic Community, headquartered in far-off Brussels, and that has rekindled 
hopes for modernization and a return of some of the prosperity of old. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Azoreans are in a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Among Europe's Poorest 
</P>
<P>
With a per capita gross national product of $1,286 in 1985, they rank among the 
poorest people in Europe, trailing Portugal, with $2,160, and Greece, with 
$3,280. About 28% of islanders work the land. 
</P>
<P>
"All through history, we've concentrated on one product -- wheat, then oranges, 
now dairy products. And that's left us very open to crisis," said Carlos 
Cordeiro, history lecturer at the Azores University on Sao Miguel, the largest 
of the nine Azores islands. 
</P>
<P>
Portugal's entry into the EEC in 1986 brought a new source of money. According 
to government figures, EEC funds will increase from $41 million in the previous 
three-year period to $511 million, or a quarter of the Azorean budget, for 
1989-1992. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force base at Lajes on Terceira, the island in the middle, was 
once a source of vital income for the islands and provided jobs for about 1,500 
Azoreans. 
</P>
<P>
But revenue from the U.S.-Portuguese base agreement is becoming less 
significant as EEC assistance rises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tourism, Farming Priorities 
</P>
<P>
And Regional President Joao Bosco Mota Amaral has set his priorities: modernize 
agriculture and fisheries and promote tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Across the water from Pico, the capital of Faial island, Horta, is already 
booming. Boat crews record their visits with graffiti on the docks, and private 
yachtsmen pack Pete's Bar, ordering drinks in French, English, German and 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Maria da Graca Sousa, director of two luxury hotels on Faial and Pico, said the 
Azores will offer 3,000 beds by next year but cannot rely on tourism alone. 
</P>
<P>
"The destiny of the Azores in tourism is not cheap," she said. "It costs a lot 
to get here and it's a very specific market -- nature, walking and water 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
Profitable alternatives are hard to find, however. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sectors in Crisis' 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly all our main sectors are in crisis. Meat and milk are products already 
in surplus in the EEC," said Mario Fortuna, a leading Azorean economist. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of negotiations, EEC officials recently authorized the 
islands to set up a duty-free manufacturing zone on Santa Maria, the 
easternmost of the Azores. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, companies can operate tax-free through the year 2011, and the 
government plans incentives for potential shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to attract manufacturers -- electronics, pharmaceuticals, 
plastics -- all light and cheap to transport," said Fortuna, who is chairman of 
the free-zone administration board. 
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult to persuade the EEC to make an exception just when it's 
trying to standardize countries for 1992," he said. "But if (the Azores) had to 
use the same rules as regions in the heart of Europe, that would be unfair 
competition -- exactly what the EEC's against." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costly Transport 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of transporting goods and supplies to the Azores is a chief 
problem, and island shopkeepers charge about 15% more for wares than stores on 
the European mainland. 
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese government in Lisbon plans to move about 140 air traffic 
controllers responsible for mid-Atlantic operations from Santa Maria Island to 
the mainland by 1990. That will mean a loss of purchasing power on the island 
of 5,000 people and turn its main community, Vilo do Porto, into another Lajes 
do Pico. 
</P>
<P>
"Many shopkeepers here say they'll close their doors when the controllers 
leave. They're not optimistic that foreigners will want to come and set up 
business here," said Luis Pereira of the commercial radio station in Vilo do 
Porto. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their isolation, Azoreans are superstitious and religious on one 
hand and open to travel, adventure and foreign ideas on the other. The latter 
is a main theme of the novel "O Barco e O Sonho" ("The Boat and the Dream") by 
the Azorean writer Manuel Ferreira. 
</P>
<P>
Recently turned into a popular Portuguese television series, the novel tells of 
two Azoreans who build a tiny sailboat to cross the Atlantic in search of a new 
life. 
</P>
<P>
They see the America of the 1950s as "a marvelous world over the sea . . . its 
flag -- a shower of stars and dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Emigration has always been a safety valve against poverty, famine and 
unemployment on the Azores. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1960 and 1980, about 160,000 Azoreans emigrated, mainly for the United 
States and Canada. Today emigrants and their descendants in North America 
number about a million -- four times as many as live on the islands.

SQUABBLES FORCE DELAY IN QUAKE AID FOR HOMELAND;

L.A.'S ARMENIA RELIEF STUCK IN PIPELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than seven months after Los Angeles-area Armenians mobilized to help their 
earthquake-ravaged homeland, the bulk of the more than $6 million in relief 
money raised has yet to be spent, and Armenian organizations are only now 
making concrete plans about what to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the largest single coalition of Southern California Armenian groups 
formed to coordinate disaster relief -- the Glendale-based Earthquake Relief 
Fund for Armenia -- announced that it is allocating $1.5 million to construct 
prefabricated housing in a small Armenian village destroyed by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
But the group has not yet signed a contract with a housing manufacturer, and 
the money has yet to be spent. In addition, more than $4 million that local 
Armenian leaders estimate has been raised by other Los Angeles-area Armenian 
organizations is still sitting in U.S. bank accounts while Armenian leaders 
squabble about what to do with the funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skeptical Toward Soviets 
</P>
<P>
Armenian organizations in the United States have been slow to spend the money 
because they are not accustomed to dealing with disaster on such a vast scale 
and they are skeptical about turning over money to the Soviet government, which 
most Armenians feel has done them wrong, Armenian community leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're the Red Cross or something, you're all set up to help," said Flora 
Dunaian, a wholesale veterinary distributor active in the Western Diocese of 
the Armenian Church. "For us, in the beginning it was a little difficult. We 
didn't know which way was up, and there was dissension as to how the money 
would be controlled. It's just been one thing after another." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Armenian community leaders say that most of the money collected for 
earthquake relief is earmarked for projects not directly related to the quake 
itself. Those leaders say their relief efforts are now entering a new phase -- 
away from sending food, blankets and medical equipment and toward taking 
advantage of perestroika -- the Soviet government's policy of political and 
economic restructuring -- to inject money and knowledge into the sagging 
Armenian economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Immediate Relief Need Left 
</P>
<P>
"Our church collected a quarter of a million dollars, and those people 
responsible for suggesting how it would be spent were very cautious," said 
Joseph Zeronian, deacon of the United Armenian Congregational Church in 
Hollywood. "Meanwhile, relief was going on and decisions were not made 
properly. So consequently, here we are down eight months, there's no immediate 
relief need left, so people are changing their perspectives to projects that 
will improve the lives of these people over the long term." 
</P>
<P>
The debate that slowed the Armenian-American response to the Dec. 7 earthquake 
was marked by fiscal conservatism, Armenian officials involved in the 
discussions said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Earthquake Relief Fund for Armenia, for example, disagreements arose 
over whether the bulk of the collected money should be used to supply food, 
medical supplies or housing. More than $500,000 worth of food and medical 
equipment was sent by the organization immediately after the quake, but since 
then, the idea of spending money on housing seems to have won out. 
</P>
<P>
"We have enough money to build about 50 houses initially," said Berdj 
Karapetian, spokesman for the Earthquake Relief Fund. "The arguments started 
over doing that versus sending blankets to 20,000 people. We realized that no 
matter which way we go, with $1.3 million we will not satisfy all the people 
who need help over there. But if we initiate a process, maybe it can have a 
snowball effect." 
</P>
<P>
The process of giving has been further slowed by the difficulty of dealing with 
the Soviet government, Armenian officials here said. Among Armenians, a 
diaspora people traditionally skeptical of those in power, decisions on where 
to spend their money have been hampered by their deep-rooted distrust of the 
Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worry Over Disbursement 
</P>
<P>
"There has always been a concern about handing the moneys over to a Communist 
country, about whether it would be disbursed properly," Zeronian said. "Right 
now things are open, but with that country, you never know." 
</P>
<P>
At the Armenian Assembly of America, for example, officials finally decided in 
April to donate the $3 million the organization raised nationwide to equip four 
factories in Soviet Armenia. But what a spokeswoman for the assembly called 
"Soviet roadblocks" have so slowed the process that the factories are a long 
way from being built. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian Protestants in the United States, a minority in the predominantly 
Roman Catholic community, have collected more than $2 million in donations for 
earthquake relief, and little of that has been spent, church officials said. 
Those officials said they plan eventually to invest the money in construction 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The intense discussions about how to use the relief funds are the outgrowth, 
perhaps more than anything else, of the consuming and passionate interest 
Armenians have in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Since Armenians in Southern California first heard of the disaster, talk of the 
earthquake and its victims has occupied every community event, every religious 
gathering, every family get-together. Southern California is home to more than 
250,000 Armenians, the largest community of this scattered people in the world 
outside Soviet Armenia. In the tight-knit community, there are few who don't 
have some connection to someone affected by the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Astonishing Generosity 
</P>
<P>
That near-obsession has translated into astonishing stories of generosity. In 
the weeks after the quake, Armenian-American businessmen donated private planes 
to carry cargo to the devastated country and more than 50 tons of medical 
equipment were sent by Los Angeles-area doctors, who also paid their own plane 
fare to get to the earthquake zone. 
</P>
<P>
So many Armenian engineers, architects and businessmen in the United States 
have plans to donate money toward the revitalization of the Armenian economy 
that an Armenian-American engineering association has set up an office in 
Yerevan, complete with phone and facsimile machine. 
</P>
<P>
Armenian students in Los Angeles and elsewhere are signing up for summer 
volunteer jobs reconstructing buildings in Armenia. And more than a dozen 
Soviet Armenian children injured in the earthquake have been flown to Los 
Angeles for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Armenian-American leaders say that questions about the deliberate pace of their 
relief efforts miss the mark. They say that they are trying their best to help 
their people; the money they have collected was donated to help Soviet Armenia, 
they say, and that is what it will do. 
</P>
<P>
"One may judge that the relief effort should have happened faster, but there is 
no perfect solution," Karapetian said. "It's frustrating. We are getting the 
feeling that they are sinking deeper and deeper over there and there is very 
little that you can do. With our little bit of money, we just want to restore a 
little bit of hope." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enormous Amount of Aid 
</P>
<P>
The money raised by Armenians in Southern California is tiny compared to the 
$500 million in international aid that poured into Armenia after the 
earthquake. Nationwide, Armenian organizations raised more than $15 million, 
almost exclusively in the first three weeks after the disaster, Armenian 
community leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
Those Armenians who raise questions as to how the money is being spent, most of 
them intellectuals and journalists, appear to be in the minority. Virtually all 
of the fund-raising was done under the auspices of various Armenian religious 
groups, and according to academics familiar with the community, Armenians trust 
their churches.

Armenian relief -- An article on July 23 incorrectly stated the amount of money 
that the Earthquake Relief Fund for Armenia, a nonprofit relief organization in 
Glendale, had allocated to construct prefabricated housing in a small Armenian

U-TURN OPENS WAY TO FOREIGN INVESTORS;

ZIMBABWE SHIFTS AWAY FROM SOCIALISM

BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zimbabwe has made a U-turn on the road to socialism set out by President Robert 
Mugabe and is opening the way to foreign investors, a Cabinet official said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even dreaming of socialism is a non-starter," Hebert Ushewokunze, the minister 
of political affairs, told businessmen assembled here recently. "We won't see 
true socialism here. Nor will our children." 
</P>
<P>
Mugabe came to power after independence from Britain in 1980 vowing to lead the 
former colony of Rhodesia on a Marxist-Leninist path, and his government 
introduced sweeping social and economic changes. 
</P>
<P>
Those changes included cheap schooling, free health care, price controls on a 
broad range of commodities and stringent, protective labor laws that critics 
said promoted inefficiency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed Economy 
</P>
<P>
But Mugabe had inherited a mixed capitalist-style economy that has remained 
largely in the hands of a 100,000-member white minority that favors the free 
enterprise system. 
</P>
<P>
For years, government and the business community coexisted uneasily. All the 
while, the economy stagnated and unemployment increased. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, experts say, about 300,000 students will leave school and enter an 
economy that is producing only 7,000 new jobs a year. Unemployed voters will 
outnumber employed voters 3 to 1 in the 1990 parliamentary election. 
</P>
<P>
So in May, after months of speculation that something of the sort was coming, 
Mugabe announced a new investment code. 
</P>
<P>
It was expounded by Ushewokunze to the businessmen in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's 
second largest city after Harare, the capital formerly called Salisbury. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lifted the lid by inviting external investors," he said. "I don't see 
this investment atmosphere as conducive to the goals of a socialist state." 
</P>
<P>
The investment code, Zimbabwe's first, has brought a mixed reaction. Many 
businessmen say it is too little, too late, while radical students and others 
have condemned it as a sell-out. 
</P>
<P>

Professor Detained 
</P>

On June 9, Kempton Makamure, a university professor and an outspoken Marxist 
ideologue, was detained by police for questioning after criticizing the code on 
state radio as a violation of socialist principles. Two journalists involved in 
the broadcast were suspended. 
</P>
<P>
While Makamure and his disciples think the code strays too far from socialist 
philosophy, a great many businessmen believe it doesn't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been given a bone, but there's not enough meat on it," said Arthur 
Chapman, a business executive in Harare. 
</P>
<P>
A black entrepreneur, who requested anonymity, said the state's ideological 
dilemma created an investment policy that "was not dramatic enough to attract 
the high rollers we really need." 
</P>
<P>
The code allows foreigners to hold 25% of the share value of new investments, 
up from 15%. It also permits them to send 25% to 100% of their profits to home 
offices in hard currencies, depending on the type and priority of the 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also pledged less state interference in business affairs and set up a 
"one-stop center" to approve investment applications within a maximum of 90 
days. He also proposed lifting most price controls, scrapping fixed wages in 
favor of collective bargaining and liberalizing labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, an employer had to have Labor Department approval to fire any 
worker, and most such applications were turned down. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not neocolonialists looking for vast hard currency returns," said one 
Western investment expert, speaking on condition of anonymity.

"What we want is a strong economy we can do business with. Zimbabwe has not 
made the quantum leap, but they've made a start."

SKAGWAY, ALASKA GOLD-RUSH TOWN, PUSHES FOR THOROUGH LEAD CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

JUNEAU, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crews have removed tainted soil near Skagway's ore terminal, but eight months 
after the discovery of extremely high levels of lead in the town there is no 
plan for cleaning homes, yards or Skagway Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's supposed to be a cleanup, but it's a half-hearted effort," said Susan 
Fredricks, one of about a dozen of Skagway's 712 residents who in April formed 
"Get the Lead Out," which is pushing for a thorough cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Two Anchorage-based environmental groups, the Alaska Center for the Environment 
and Trustees for Alaska, last month asked the federal government to take over 
the cleanup. They called the work so far "patently irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
Records indicate that the effort has been ineffectual and marred by legal 
problems and lack of agreement among the four companies responsible. The 
removal of soil near the terminal and railroad tracks halted in May for the 
tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Stokes, regional supervisor of the state Department of Environmental 
Conservation in Juneau, says the cleanup is going as fast as possible 
considering its complexity, but gave the companies until July 14 to agree on a 
plan for the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Order 
</P>
<P>
Extremely high lead levels in the terminal's soil were revealed last fall in 
tests conducted by terminal operator Bowhead Equipment Co., which is under a 
federal order to stop polluting the harbor. Further tests confirmed that the 
Gold Rush town's role as a mining port had created an insidious byproduct. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lead dust in people's carpets, on their windowsills, on their 
doorsills, embedded in their beds and furniture," said Kristine Benson, a soil 
scientist with the Alaska Center for the Environment. 
</P>
<P>
The highest levels were at the terminal and railroad tracks, where 
concentrations of 133,000 parts per million have been found. Lead naturally is 
present in Skagway soil at about 50 parts per million, and the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency has ordered cleanups elsewhere if levels in 
soil exceeded 500-1,000 ppm. 
</P>
<P>
Lead also is in residents' blood, although state health officials concluded in 
November that few had absorbed enough to pose a risk. Environmentalists say 
that conclusion was based on an outdated standard. 
</P>
<P>
Lead can cause headaches, anemia, colic, paralysis and cramps. It also can 
stunt growth in children and cause birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
"The symptoms are very subtle," Benson said. "I don't think anyone can say with 
any confidence that there have been no ill effects in Skagway." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the state conservation department said a risk exists -- especially 
for children -- and promised to remove the lead. Officials decided to clean the 
terminal area first while testing to determine the extent of contamination in 
residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first priority was to cut off contamination from the source," Stokes said, 
adding that Bowhead Equipment has been able to prevent the ore from being 
spread through town by trucks and released into the air during ship loading. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Records 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to state records: 
</P>
<P>
* White Pass &amp; Yukon Route violated state law twice by leaving a pile of 
contaminated soil uncovered and exposed to wind. Stokes, in a letter, scolded a 
railroad official for failing to "understand the seriousness of the cleanup." 
No punitive action was taken, but Stokes said the company will have to pay for 
the state's investigation of the violations. 
</P>
<P>
* Soil has been removed twice from the east side of the terminal, but tests 
after each found more than the target of 1,000 ppm. of lead. The area, 
traversed by cruise ship passengers until last month, has been sealed. 
</P>
<P>
* Tests showed that the cleanup of a 10-foot corridor along the railroad tracks 
also was insufficient.

Dissident Fang Lizhi, who has taken shelter in the U.S. Embassy since the 
bloody crushing of pro-democracy protests in June, has been stripped of his 
posts in a Chinese research society, official reports said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The China Natural Dialectics Research Society took the action against Fang, an 
astrophysicist, because of his alleged "counter-revolutionary" crimes, the 
People's Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
Fang had served as an executive vice chairman and council member of the 
society, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
Fang and his physicist wife Li Shuxian, both outspoken critics of the Communist 
authorities, have been the target of vitriolic attacks in China's media since 
seeking asylum in the embassy after the army massacre of protesters in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
China describes the couple as wanted criminals and has accused the United 
States of violating international law by sheltering them.

PITTING BULL AGAINST BULL; 
</P>
<P>
THAI-STYLE CORRIDA A GAME FOR BETTORS

<P>
Two bulls goring each other on a muddy field in Thailand is a far cry from the 
ritualized bullfights of Spain, which pit man against beast, but the intensity 
of the Thai conflict's popular appeal is the same. 
</P>
<P>
An American on vacation in southern Thailand cheered wildly, along with a crowd 
of big bettors watching two bulls battle it out on a waterlogged field in 
Trang, until one bull was worn down and ran away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting to see animal fighting animal," Harold Ladderman said. "I don't 
think it's cruel because one bull can run away when it has had enough." 
</P>
<P>
Traditional bullfighting is one of the top gambling sports in southern 
Thailand, with crowds ranging from top politicians and police chiefs to 
peasants. 
</P>
<P>
Fights sell out weeks in advance and bettors venerate bulls with special names 
such as Daeng Kumanthong (Red Golden Child) and Daeng Raja (Red King). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Greedy Punters' 
</P>
<P>
"Bullfighting is very fair. What you see is what you get," said one fan. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can fix the game, unlike boxing where betting can be much more risky 
because of greedy punters (bettors) who try to fix the game," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Bullfighting has always been an important part of festivals in the southern 
Thai provinces of Songkla, Pattalung, Trang and Nakorn Srithammarat. 
</P>
<P>
The contest begins with a drum roll. Then the bulls, tethered face to face, are 
released from their ropes to attack each other with their sharp horns. 
</P>
<P>
Bets are placed by hand signals during the fights, which last for anywhere from 
10 minutes to an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"All people here come to bet, so they don't mind paying a 600 baht ($24) 
admission fee," a fan said. 
</P>
<P>
Vinit Singkajornvorakul, 50, who owns 16 bulls, selects his fighting bulls at 
the age of 2. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Long Ears, Small Eyes' 
</P>
<P>
"The signs of a good fighting bull are long ears, small eyes, a short face and 
long hair," Vinit said. 
</P>
<P>
A special diet for two years, a harsh training regime -- including forced runs 
with two 20-pound sandbags strapped to their necks to build up neck muscles -- 
prepares the young bulls for the arduous battle in a waterlogged arena. 
</P>
<P>
Vinit said there were about 600 fighting bulls in the four southern provinces, 
with weekly contests taking place at legally registered sites. 
</P>
<P>
Bullfights are not held anywhere else in Thailand. In other areas, bettors 
wager on bouts between fighting cocks or between tiny Siamese fighting fish. 
</P>
<P>
"This is part of our heritage in the south, which we have to preserve at all 
costs," Vinit said. "We do not see it as cruel to animals because it is very 
rare that a bull will fight to the death."

The average salary for teachers rose 5.5% to a record $29,629 last year, but 
after inflation the average teacher only earned about $700 more than in 1972, 
said a teachers union survey released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The annual report issued by the 710,000-member American Federation of Teachers 
said average beginning salaries for U.S. teachers went up by 5.8% during the 
1988-1989 school year to reach $19,598. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska had the highest average salary at $41,832, even though it was one of 
only three states -- the others being Wyoming and Utah -- where salaries fell. 
South Dakota had the lowest average salary at $20,525. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the top 10 are Connecticut, $37,659;, Washington, D.C., $36,787; 
New York, $36,654; Michigan, $35,530; California, $35,172; Rhode Island, 
$34,234; Maryland, $33,900; New Jersey, $32,862, and Massachusetts, $32,200.

Three Thai fishermen have been arrested on suspicion of killing 56 Vietnamese 
boat people in the latest of a spate of bloody attacks in the Gulf of Thailand, 
police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Thai officials said the fishermen used knives and axes to kill all but two of 
the people on board a refugee boat on March 26. Some of the victims had their 
kneecaps smashed first to prevent them from swimming to safety. 
</P>
<P>
The boat people were attacked three days after they sailed from the southern 
Vietnamese town of Vung Tao. Ten of the victims were women. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors Pham Ngoc, 33, and Do Va, 14, were rescued by a Malaysian boat and 
handed over to U.N. refugee officials. Pham escaped by hiding beneath the boat 
while Do Va stayed on board but played dead. 
</P>
<P>
Thai officials, who are investigating 10 similar attacks, said the pair 
identified the three fishermen Thursday.

READY-TO-EAT RATIONS INCLUDE TOOTSIE ROLLS, POUND CAKE;

<P>
A LOOK AT WHAT WILL SUSTAIN SOLDIER OF FUTURE

When the average infantryman eats dinner after a hard day on the battlefield, 
Army researchers found, he wants fast food, candy and bread. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army's Natick Research, Development and Engineering Center in Natick, 
Mass., has been evaluating combat rations and equipment, and this week showed 
lawmakers in the Dirksen Senate Office Building the latest in Army equipment -- 
improved rations, clothing, parachutes and more. 
</P>
<P>
Besides bread, the soldier of tomorrow will be able to eat such unwarrior-like 
food as pound cake and Tootsie Rolls. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment on display was developed by the Natick researchers, but it is 
produced by outside contractors who bid for approximately $3.5 billion in 
contracts annually, said Robert Lewis, Natick's technical director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meals Ready to Eat 
</P>
<P>
The researchers have spent the last few years developing ways to improve Meals 
Ready to Eat (MREs), which have been the Army's standard combat ration since 
they replaced C-rations in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Three MREs a day must provide a soldier with 3,600 calories and the surgeon 
general's military daily allowance of vitamins and minerals. At the same time, 
MREs must be completely portable and have a shelf life of three years. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, those requirements severely restricted the menu, because the 
food must fit into small, airtight pouches. Soldiers consistently told 
researchers they wanted more choices, bigger entrees and food more like what 
they ate at home, said Jerry Darsch, chief of Natick's food technology 
division. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Listened to Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Many of them did not finish their meals. "We like to think we have 781,000 
consultants in the Army alone and we try to listen to what they have to say," 
Darsch said. 
</P>
<P>
To begin to meet soldiers complaints, the Army added nine new entrees, 
commercial candies like M&amp;Ms and Tootsie Rolls, 1-inch-tall bottles of 
Tabasco sauce and drink mixes such as Kool-Aid. The entree size has been 
increased from 5 1/2 ounces to 8 ounces. The new meals cost $3.50 apiece, about 
the same as the old ones, Darsch said. 
</P>
<P>
More changes are on the way. Natick researchers recently developed a way to 
make "shelf-stable bread products" -- everything from plain white bread to 
pound cake to pizza crusts. Baked with a special sugar product that keeps it 
from going stale, the bread is stored with a small packet of preservatives that 
absorb oxygen and moisture. The textures are somewhat denser than that of 
normal bread, but the shelf-stable variety tastes like its supermarket cousin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ballpark Franks, Burritos 
</P>
<P>
In the next couple of years, soldiers will also be getting burritos, hamburgers 
and even hot dogs with buns. The hot dogs are a bit smaller than those sold in 
supermarkets, but they taste like a ballpark frank, although probably lower in 
cholesterol, sodium and fat. Darsch noted that all Army food is specially 
chosen to be healthful. 
</P>
<P>
Because it takes three years to get new foods into all the bases, soldiers 
stuck with old rations will get supplemental food packs containing breads, 
candies and other new foods such as beef jerky and granola. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ways to Heat Rations 
</P>
<P>
The researchers are also looking for ways to heat the rations. Soldiers 
complain that rations taste awful cold. Tank crews will be given special 
heaters that operate much like electric blankets, and ground troops will 
receive metal canteen cups and stands in which they can heat water to warm the 
MRE pouches. 
</P>
<P>
A little further in the future will come self-heating meals. Each MRE will come 
with a small package of a chemical -- a magnesium alloy -- that will produce 
heat when the soldier adds water. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the Natick researchers spruce up the regular diet, they have also 
developed specialized food for soldiers in arctic conditions and for 
reconnaissance forces who need to travel very light. Rations, Cold Weather 
provide soldiers with 4,500 calories a day and use more dehydrated foods that 
do not freeze in extreme cold. 
</P>
<P>
The Special Operations forces that spend long periods behind enemy lines also 
have a meal of their own, Rations, Lightweight 30 Days. These small packs 
consist primarily of dried foods and are designed to be "the ultimate in 
nutritional and caloric density," Darsch said. Each day's ration provides 2,000 
calories and weighs less than a pound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest in Army Clothing 
</P>
<P>
The Natick researchers said they have not forgotten the rest of the soldier's 
life. The display featured the latest in Army clothing -- from bulletproof 
vests to suits that protect against toxic materials and come with a four-hour 
air supply. The researchers' goals are always to provide more protection at 
less weight, said researcher Dave Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
Modern fabrics provide the basis for most of the improvements. While the 
five-piece arctic weather gear relies on Gore-tex for wind protection and 
polypropylene for warmth, the bulletproof vest and helmet are made of Kevlar. 
The Extended Cold Weather Clothing System -- which costs $240 a set -- has been 
reduced in weight from 28 to 20 pounds and the Kevlar vest weighs a pound less 
than its ballistic nylon predecessor did, Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revamped Sleeping Bags 
</P>
<P>
Natick teams have also revamped traditional equipment such as backpacks and 
sleeping bags. The modern soldier will receive sleeping booties and a hood with 
his sleeping bag. All can be stuffed in a sack so the soldier doesn't have to 
waste time rolling up the sleeping bag. 
</P>
<P>
The bag fits in a pocket of the new backpack so it doesn't have to hang off the 
bottom. The backpack also has innovations such as a pad for the lower back and 
a top flap that converts to a much smaller backpack for short patrols. 
</P>
<P>
Parachutes and tents also fall under Natick's purview, and researchers are 
using a new fabric that reduces injuries by slowing the soldier's fall, said 
Jeanine Chapdelaine, a mechanical engineer at Natick. 
</P>
<P>
Natick has just begun research and development of a clothing system to protect 
a soldier from all hazards at the same time. The Soldier Integrated Protective 
Ensemble (SINE) is designed to protect the wearer against climatic extremes, 
toxic substances and bullets. It will even have its own air supply. Scheduled 
for use in the late 1990s, SINE "should take the soldier into the 21st 
Century," said Carol Fitzgerald of Natick's chemical protection section.

SHERIFF GETS OUT OF TOWN OFTEN TO AVOID BEING 'BORED TO DEATH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy took 16 trips during the first half of this 
year, frequently traveling on personal business, and was away from the county 
for nearly a third of the workdays during that period. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy was gone from San Diego for at least 50 days -- visiting such 
destinations as Washington, Hawaii and the Gulf Coast of Florida -- and his 
extensive travels came at a time when his department was under fire from the 
San Diego County Grand Jury for being poorly managed and under-supervised. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, in a rare, 90-minute interview last week, said there was absolutely 
nothing wrong with his leaving the county that often. 
</P>
<P>
"If I did nothing but be the sheriff of San Diego County, I'd be bored to 
death," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff said that he stays in close touch with the department while he 
travels and that his undersheriff and assistant sheriffs "do a tremendous job" 
in day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serves on Professional Groups 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, who has held his elected post since 1971, said he has become a 
nationally recognized expert on law enforcement and that he frequently serves 
on professional organizations throughout the country that support law 
enforcement efforts. He said that, if his life were limited to working in his 
office, he would find the job very unfulfilling. 
</P>
<P>
And he made light of a suggestion that his extensive trips provide few benefits 
to the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Who cares what benefit there is?" he said. "San Diego County isn't the end of 
the world. There's a bigger world outside San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's travel pace is documented in the pages of his weekly calendars, 
obtained by The Times after the newspaper filed a lawsuit seeking access to a 
series of public records Duffy had decided not to make available. The sheriff 
refused for a year to turn over the calendars, but finally did so on the eve of 
submitting to a legal deposition in connection with the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The calendars, which are circulated among the Sheriff's Department's top 
commanders to inform them of his weekly schedule, do not specify whether Duffy 
actually took all of the scheduled trips. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he "probably made" every one of the trips, adding that "there are 
probably some you don't even know about" from the calendars. Three key 
officials in the department confirmed that the calendars truly reflect Duffy's 
activities, particularly when it comes to his out-of-town travels. 
</P>
<P>
The 16 trips during the first six months of this year include eight county-paid 
trips costing about $5,000 in taxpayers' money, and eight trips on personal 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's travels in 1989 fit a pattern that he has set on his excursions the 
past five years. 
</P>
<P>
According to county records, Duffy left San Diego on 71 county-paid trips from 
1984 through 1988 and billed the county more than $32,000 in travel costs. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff said his personal calendars for earlier years have been destroyed, 
and it is not known how many personal trips he during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Other sheriffs in the state, as well as San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen, go 
on far fewer trips outside their jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
Since being confirmed as police chief in September, Burgreen has taken only 
three trips -- for three days to a conference in Portland, Ore., and twice for 
one day each to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Checks with three other sheriffs in California showed that they often shy away 
from extensive out-of-town trips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Worry Every Time I Leave' 
</P>
<P>
"I worry every time I leave," said Sheriff Charles C. Plummer of Alameda 
County. "I don't like to leave unless it's really something important. I'm just 
that kind of guy. I just like being here." 
</P>
<P>
But Plummer said he understands why Duffy would have a more active travel 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"I know John is one of those guys who's president of everything there is to be 
a president of, or the past president," Plummer said. "He's a real leader in 
Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's weekly calendars show that, when the sheriff is in town, he often does 
not attend many management meetings or otherwise participate in the direct 
supervision of the department. Instead, his calendars are full of personal, 
political and social dates, such as haircut and dental appointments, banquets, 
luncheons and dinners, Irish celebrations and meetings with his politically 
active Honorary Deputy Sheriffs Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In six months' time, Duffy met just once with his Metropolitan Homicide Task 
Force, which is investigating more than 40 murders of prostitutes. When the 
grand jury issued its report in March sharply criticizing the Sheriff's 
Department for losing control over deputy misconduct in the jails, Duffy was in 
Long Beach attending a four-day California State Sheriffs Assn. conference 
aboard the Queen Mary luxury liner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making Himself Scarce 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the calendars indicate that Duffy attended only three of his 
department's weekly Executive Management Team meetings during the first six 
months of the year. Three high-ranking officials inside the department said the 
sheriff shows up only sporadically for a weekly breakfast session with his 
undersheriff and assistant sheriffs. They said he is never present for a 
monthly meeting with the captains. 
</P>
<P>
Three top-level officials in the department said in recent interviews that 
Duffy's absence from headquarters has stymied some operations because these 
officials must wait for the sheriff to return and make routine management 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"When you say he's an absentee landlord, that's an understatement," said a 
sheriff's commander, who, like other department officials, asked not to be 
named because he feared retribution from Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, two captains said that Duffy almost never visits their patrol stations 
and that, except for social and ceremonial functions, they go for months 
without ever seeing him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've yet to see him in my building," one captain said. "And I'm not the 
exception, but the rule. 
</P>
<P>
"It tells me that, as an individual, he doesn't really have any great interest 
with what's going on out here. Top-level management is essentially operating in 
a vacuum. And there is frustration. Our opinions and our expertise are not 
valued. And the only time we hear from him is when something is perceived to 
have gone wrong, and then we're castigated." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoids Meetings 
</P>
<P>
Duffy acknowledged that he rarely visits the patrol stations and infrequently 
attends management meetings at headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
He said he purposely sidesteps many management meetings because, otherwise, his 
top command would punt many of the tough management decisions that must be made 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
"I avoid those meetings," he said. "If I go, they'll want me to make the 
decisions and save themselves from doing a lot of staff work." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Duffy said, he sees his role as setting policy for the Sheriff's 
Department and making sure the agency is organized and efficient. 
</P>
<P>
"I set policy, and I organize the department," he said. "I don't do the 
day-to-day work. Instead, I organize the Sheriff's Department for efficient and 
effective law enforcement. That's my mandate." 
</P>
<P>
He said that, whether he's in a sickbed or a hotel bed in another part of the 
world, he remains the sheriff of San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the sheriff's trips occurred on days leading up to or immediately 
after a weekend, and most of them appear to be for conferences held by private 
organizations made up of law enforcement officials. But he also has traveled to 
Washington and Sacramento to testify about pending legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Of his 16 trips this year, half were paid for by the county. 
</P>
<P>
The first county-paid trip occurred during the first week of the year, when 
Duffy spent four days in St. Petersburg, Fla., for a regional meeting of the 
Police Executive Research Forum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visit to Honolulu 
</P>
<P>
The most recent county-sponsored hiatus was a six-day visit to Honolulu for a 
National Sheriffs Assn. conference. 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight personal trips, Duffy's calendars do not indicate who paid the 
travel costs. 
</P>
<P>
The calendars do not give any reason for three of the trips -- two to Dallas 
and one to Washington -- that placed him out of San Diego for six days earlier 
this year. Duffy said he could not remember why he went to those cities. 
</P>
<P>
He said the other trips, where travel reasons are indicated on the calendars, 
came about mostly because of his heavy involvement with professional law 
enforcement support groups around the nation. He said he is a committee 
chairman of the National Sheriffs Assn., a committee chairman and past 
president of the California State Sheriffs Assn., and a founding member of the 
Police Executive Research Forum. 
</P>
<P>
He said that in past years he has attended international police chiefs' 
sessions in London, West Germany and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm what you might call a professional volunteer," he said. "In my profession, 
I'm one good cop. I'm very good at it." 
</P>
<P>
The three top Sheriff's Department officials interviewed by The Times said they 
see no direct benefit to the county from Duffy's trips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indirect Benefits 
</P>
<P>
"Indirectly, there probably is some benefit," one captain said. "It's necessary 
for a department head to maintain liaisons with other departments, so 
undoubtedly there is some indirect benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"But the direct benefits? I can't point out any." 
</P>
<P>
Sources within Duffy's office said that when the sheriff is out of town the 
daily management machinery often locks down. They said Duffy insists on giving 
final approval to countless management decisions, such as the routine promotion 
of rank-and-file deputies, and that when he is gone the top command staff often 
is unable to keep the department moving smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the big (complaints) down there (at headquarters) is that the top 
command will do the groundwork and evaluations for promotions," said an 
official in the Deputy Sheriffs Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"And then Duffy takes his yellow pad and reorganizes the department while he's 
on airplanes. All the way down to the deputies -- who's going to be promoted 
and who's going to be passed over. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what he's always done. He has a lot of lag time on airplanes, and he 
won't let anyone take his power away from him." 
</P>
<P>
A commander remembered instances in which a number of proposals collected dust 
for months on the sheriff's desk -- plans for design changes in the uniforms 
worn by deputies to more substantive projects such as upgrading deputies' 
firearms and a career ladder program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Major Bottleneck' 
</P>
<P>
"He has to give his stamp of approval on everything, and because of that, he's 
become a major bottleneck," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's captain added: 
</P>
<P>
"He's unavailable to make major policy decisions that affect the entire 
department, or at least major divisions of the department. Critical operational 
policies have to be deferred until he's returned. 
</P>
<P>
"The people need access to him, and they don't have that. So we're limited and 
can't implement new procedures or address problems that need to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy denied assertions that his absences leave the department stranded. He 
said he takes along reams of paper work to read on airplanes, has materials 
faxed to his hotel rooms, and is always in touch by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, this is the modern age," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, he said that one night in 1978, while asleep in a Paris hotel 
room, he was awakened by a news reporter who wanted his comment on a Board of 
Supervisors' request that he return home immediately. The five-member board 
wanted him back in San Diego because many of his deputies were staging a 
"sickout" over working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"My response was that I know what's going on," Duffy said. "I'm in daily 
contact with my office. Wherever I am in the world, I'm still the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"So I stayed in Paris. And I'll be damned if I'll come home just because five 
politicians are getting nervous about something that doesn't need my immediate 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Would Bring Him Back? 
</P>
<P>
Asked what kind of crisis would require his immediate attention and cut short 
one of his trips, Duffy said it would be only if one of his deputies were 
killed in the line of duty. "I can't think of anything else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his many trips away from San Diego, Duffy has kept a powerful political 
lock on his job for two decades. Rarely has any opposition candidate given the 
sheriff a real contest, and political insiders point to Duffy's strong 
political base both in San Diego and statewide as the main reason for his 
longevity in office. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has not formally announced his intentions, he said in the interview 
that he plans to run for a sixth term next year. 
</P>
<P>
But the past year has been grueling for Duffy and his department. The grand 
jury, in its report in March verifying allegations of inmates being assaulted 
by jail deputies, sharply chastised the sheriff for not keeping closer 
management tabs on the situation in the crowded jails. 
</P>
<P>
"Proper and vigilant supervision is the key to good management," the panel told 
the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said the grand jury's findings have not prompted him to more closely 
supervise the patrol side of his department. But, he said, "I am keeping a 
closer eye on the jails." 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's calendars, which are prepared by an administrative secretary, 
carry many suggestions, apparently from the sheriff's administrative staff, 
encouraging him to catch up on his paper work. Notations such as "CLEAR OFF 
PENDING PAPERWORK," "Free day, paperwork, return phone calls, catch up, etc.," 
and "Signatures/Action, A MUST!!!" are sprinkled throughout the calendars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Block Time' 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said he attends to many meetings and management tasks that are not listed 
in the calendars. He noted that often large portions of his days are set aside 
for "block time." 
</P>
<P>
"You probably wondered what block time was," he said. "That's time set aside 
for me to do whatever I want. It could be anything. Or it could be nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Duffy's top command were incensed when Duffy wandered into his 
downtown headquarters on a recent late afternoon and became angry because the 
offices were empty. 
</P>
<P>
The command staff, which normally works a 7 a.m.-to-3 p.m. shift, had gone 
home, the sources said, and the irritated sheriff fired off a memo ordering his 
subordinates to spend more time in the office during the workday. 
</P>
<P>
"That letter bothered a lot of us," a captain said. "We are salaried employees 
and people who do our jobs, and we work well beyond a 40-hour week." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy denied that he ever wrote the memo. "No such thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And he plans to keep on traveling. He said he leaves this week for a four-day 
trip to Columbus, Ohio, to attend a meeting on law enforcement accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need to be sitting in my office all day," he said. "I don't need to be 
sitting there pushing all the buttons."

MARINE VOLUNTEERS TEST LIMITS OF FATIGUE, DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GLIONNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They looked otherworldly, like bit characters from some late-night science 
fiction thriller. 
</P>
<P>
They wore eerie-looking masks and sucked air through charcoal filters as they 
staggered repeatedly around a gravel track with backpacks full of lead weights, 
the long miles leaving blisters on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
In all, they would stay awake for more than 40 hours straight, much of the time 
injected with a drug that rendered them even more groggy and irritable. 
</P>
<P>
When they weren't walking, they memorized Marine training manuals or reeled 
from computer response-time tests. A shrill alarm sounded the moment they dozed 
off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life-Saving Test 
</P>
<P>
Sound like a waking nightmare? For 2 dozen Marines volunteering for a chemical 
defense study at Camp Pendleton, the experience was a little bit of heaven. 
</P>
<P>
It was a chance to go where no Marine had gone before, to show their mettle by 
completing a physical and emotional obstacle course dreamed up by the 
scientists who stood by with clipboards and raised eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
"No other Marine has ever done this," said Lance Cpl. Carl Toomer of Ft. Worth, 
Tex., during a moment of relaxation inside a Marine tent. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the reasons I volunteered, to be first at something. I may never 
get the chance again." 
</P>
<P>
This summer, 96 gung-ho Marines are participating in a military study to 
determine the effects of atropine, an antidote that just might save their lives 
during a chemical war. The military wants to discover whether the drug , which 
causes such side effects as drowsiness, quickened heart rate and a reduced 
ability to sweat, inhibits a soldier's performance when combined with the 
stress of battle. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a soldier has been exposed to a chemical agent and then uses atropine as 
an antidote, we want to see if he's still fit for combat, to fly a plane or man 
a ship," said Dr. Carl Englund, a research psychologist at the Naval Health 
Research Center, known for its sleep deprivation studies during the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to find out when they'll start making mistakes, how many times they 
can walk around a track or take a computer quiz without giving up. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, they might just be failing a test. But in battle, they might be shooting 
fellow soldiers or mis-setting critical dials." 
</P>
<P>
Before they walked their first mile, Camp Pendleton Marine volunteers signed 
consent forms that include their option to drop out at any time. 
</P>
<P>
The procedures demonstrate the military's progress since the days when the Army 
tested mind-altering drugs such as LSD on unknowing volunteers, including 
mental patients, in secret experiments during the 1950s, according to 
congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Tests Than Ever 
</P>
<P>
A military panel that reviews testing methods, called the Committee for 
Protection of Human Subjects -- made up of scientists, a physician, chaplain 
and an attorney -- held up the start of the Pendleton study for nine months as 
it reviewed the tests involved. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the military is conducting more tests than ever involving human 
subjects, according to Capt. Robert D. Chaney, commanding officer of the Naval 
Health Research Center on Point Loma, who oversaw Camp Pendleton's chemical 
defense study. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the research involves coping with adverse climates, including testing 
ice vests as heat protectors on Navy ships in the Persian Gulf and developing 
ways to better deal with Arctic temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are also exploring the types of diseases that military men can 
contract while wandering in jungle environments in Africa and the South 
Pacific, as well as looking at the attention spans of soldiers manning tedious 
but critical jobs such as sonar operators and air traffic controllers. 
</P>
<P>
The Camp Pendleton tests, which have taken five years and $1.6 million to 
complete and will be finished early next month, are part of a government study 
on chemical defense readiness that has involved all branches of the military, 
Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who gave those patients LSD without telling them deserved to be 
crucified," he said. "But you can be sure that none of that's happening today. 
</P>
<P>
"The boys who volunteered for this study were briefed in plain English about 
the pros and cons of what was going to happen to them. Nobody came in here 
blind." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Monday afternoon, a bus containing some of the 96 volunteers 
arrived at Camp Pendleton after a day of tests in a Navy lab on Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
"The study simulates a reconnaissance mission, with volunteers doing computer 
tests acting as mission command, and the ones on the track playing the part of 
soldiers in the field," Englund said. 
</P>
<P>
To simulate battle fatigue, the Marines stayed awake for almost two days. Near 
the end of the test, they would don the 
</P>
<P>
chemical defense suits known as MOPP (mission-oriented protective posture) 
gear. 
</P>
<P>
In place of atropine, scientists injected some Marines with Benadryl, a 
commonly prescribed antihistamine that has many of the same side effects. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all the Marines got the drug; some got placebos," Englund said. "And not 
all of them were required to wear the MOPP gear. Some just worked on the 
computer test part of the study. Others walked on the track but didn't wear the 
extra gear." 
</P>
<P>
Only the "lucky" ones got the entire treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones who didn't get to wear the suits and hit the track acted like they 
were left out," Englund said. "These guys are all pretty young, so I guess it 
was a macho thing. But they were really disappointed, like they weren't given a 
chance to show us what they could really do." 
</P>
<P>
Under a hot sun, some Marines circled the track carrying backpacks filled with 
lead weights equaling half their weight. Sensors to record their body 
temperatures were attached to their heads and chests. Probes jutted from their 
bodies. Gauges to track their heart rates were fastened to their arms. 
</P>
<P>
After four trips around the track, the Marines paused to take a battery of 
exams. They either studied the camouflage-colored Marine basic information 
manual or tried their hand at several computer response-time tests. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, they answered written questions to gauge how they were feeling, 
how hard they were working. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I feeling cynical?" was one of the questions asked. "Do I have thoughts of 
killing myself?" "Am I losing interest in other people?" 
</P>
<P>
The next hour, they repeated the ritual. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pretty Tough Cookies' 
</P>
<P>
"Before this thing started, every one of us had an idea that Marines were some 
pretty tough cookies, but seeing this in person makes you appreciate just how 
tough these guys really are," said Jay Heaney, an NHRC research physiologist, 
as he watched the Marines round the track. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time our last group finished, all of them had these horrible blisters 
on their feet from the walk. They were staggering, waddling -- anything to get 
around that track. One of the physicians told one of the guys that if it were 
him, he'd drop out of the study. 
</P>
<P>
"But the guy just kept going. I guess their philosophy is that if they were 
stranded out in some battlefield, blisters or no blisters, they'd have to walk 
back in." 
</P>
<P>
During a break, one winded Marine described the best way to beat mental 
fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't think about nothin' when you're out there," he said. "Because if you 
think too much, it starts to hurt. And so you just walk." 
</P>
<P>
Some Marines involved in the study scoffed at the idea of showing their 
machismo with hours of brute labor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather be the brains than the brawn any day," observed 23-year-old Cpl. 
Ramon Luna, a volunteer who sat in front of a computer. "I'm a grunt. So I've 
done all that before. This time, I'll let some other fool do it for me." 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, those Marines fortunate enough to be selected for the most 
grueling tests were ready to don the MOPP gear. They would wear the suits 
during the final 12 hours of the test, just when their weariness had begun to 
take its ugliest toll. 
</P>
<P>
"Being inside those suits is a nightmare, let me tell you. I've been there," 
said Tony Sucec, an NHRC research physiologist and director of San Diego State 
University's exercise physiology lab. 
</P>
<P>
"They were made to keep chemicals out, so they keep things inside, too. You 
sweat to death. When you get thirsty, you have to suck water from a tube 
attached to a bag you carry. 
</P>
<P>
"The suit is a heavy parka thing with a mask and rain suit. You breathe through 
a charcoal filter. Your vision is restricted. You look like an inflated 
frogman. And with the plastic boots and gloves you wear, just try scratching an 
itch." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Sucec, several other university scientists assisted with the study, 
trading their expertise for hard data they can use in their own research. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testing Limits of Fatigue 
</P>
<P>
"We're testing the limits of fatigue with these Marines, but there are sports 
applications to the tests as well," said Ron Bulbulian, director of sports 
physiology at the University of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the era of the ultra-marathon. Athletes are pushing themselves to new 
levels. And Benadryl is used frequently by athletes and all kinds of people for 
hay fever, so we can look at the results of that." 
</P>
<P>
By 8 p.m. Wednesday, the torture had finally stopped. The next morning, after a 
few more tests, the Marines would be free to leave. 
</P>
<P>
But not before some Marines admitted having some regrets about volunteering a 
week for the study. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked for volunteers three months ago, and I stuck my hand in the air 
like some blamed fool," said one. "I'm crazy. I mean, I got a girlfriend 
waiting at home a half-mile away, and I'm out here sweating bullets on this 
track. Why would anyone come out here and do this?" 
</P>
<P>
Added another, after what seemed like his millionth trip around the oval: 
</P>
<P>
"If you ever see me raise my hand again, cut my arm off."

ORANGE COUNTY SCRAMBLES TO FIND BILINGUAL SCHOOLTEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Orange County schools grow increasingly diverse with pupils of many 
backgrounds and languages, school districts are struggling to find enough 
bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
During the school year just ended, all 28 of the county's school districts 
failed to comply with at least part of the state's bilingual education 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the compliance review, done every three years, illustrate the 
growing need for such teachers as well as the uncertainty that has reigned at 
school districts statewide since California's stringent bilingual-education law 
expired in 1987. But armed with new guidelines issued by the state Department 
of Education earlier this year, school districts in increasingly polyglot 
Orange County are racing to recruit teachers with bilingual credentials to meet 
state rules. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wooed With Bonuses 
</P>
<P>
So intense is the competition that these specialized instructors are being 
actively recruited and in some cases wooed with bonuses and stipends. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say 1% of the school districts in the state got an A on their report 
card, and 99% (had something) out of compliance," said Estella Acosta, who is 
in charge of bilingual-teacher training for the Orange County Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Education says 15.8% of Orange County's student 
enrollment in 1988 was classified as "limited English proficient," meaning that 
their primary language was something other than English. An update is due in a 
few weeks, and local and statewide educators say the new data will undoubtedly 
reflect an increase in limited-English speaking students in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
As the number of such students has increased, so has the number of different 
languages spoken in local schools. In the Garden Grove Unified School District, 
for example, administrators face the daunting task of teaching children who 
speak 71 different languages, including Spanish, Cambodian, Tagalog, Laotian 
and Hmong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Summer Scrambling 
</P>
<P>
For local school districts, summer is the time for scrambling to bring 
bilingual programs into compliance with new state guidelines, either by more 
aggressive recruiting of bilingual teachers or by submitting alternative plans 
for serving their multi-ethnic student populations despite a severe shortage of 
bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
For the small number of teachers with credentials to teach students whose 
English is limited, the summer months are a time to be courted by districts 
desperate to find more bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a month after he earned his teaching degree at Cal State Fullerton 
and got his credentials as a bilingual-education teacher, Ruben Gonzalez has 
had job offers from four schools, and he doesn't know which to accept. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many offers," he lamented. "But I have all summer to think about 
it. I feel lucky, to tell you the truth. I feel wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Another recent graduate, Ingrid Ragland, who also has a bilingual-teaching 
credential, was offered a job by the Fullerton School District, where her 
daughter attends elementary school -- even though Ragland never applied to work 
there. 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Ana Unified School District, where more than half the students are 
limited in English, administrators learned of a teacher from Central America 
who was fluent in English and Spanish, and quickly tried to recruit her. They 
were undeterred by her lack of the proper work visa and began working with the 
U.S. State Department and other agencies to help the teacher get the proper 
visa and emergency credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Unified now has 230 teachers with bilingual certificates, 63 more 
than the previous school year, district spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. But only 
two of those are certified in a language other than Spanish. "We certainly need 
more," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In that district, 51% of the district's 40,000 students are considered limited 
in English, a higher percentage than any of the large school districts in the 
state, even higher than the sprawling Los Angeles Unified School District, 
where 27% of the enrollment is considered limited in English. 
</P>
<P>
So great is the need for bilingual teachers in the Santa Ana district that 
principals and assistant principals are sent to colleges in the Midwest to 
recruit teachers, Assistant Supt. Don Champlin said. 
</P>
<P>
But the situation is not limited to the more urban areas of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specialist Hired 
</P>
<P>
At the Saddleback Valley Unified School District in southern Orange County, 
where students are predominantly Anglo, the number of limited-English students 
has grown to 685 this year. An increase of about 150 students in the last year 
alone prompted administrators to hire a specialist in limited-English 
instruction. Maria Quezada, who began working for the district in April, said 
there are now 36 different languages spoken among Saddleback's students, and 
administrators have started refocusing their instructional program to ensure 
that those children will be taught in the most effective way. 
</P>
<P>
And they know the competition for qualified bilingual teachers is tough. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past you could say, 'There aren't any bilingual teachers out there,' 
and that was that," Quezada said. "Now you have to do a little more. . . . You 
have to be very pro-active. . . . Some districts are even going into the 
universities and offering contracts to teachers in their third or fourth year 
of school." 
</P>
<P>
Graduation tallies at Cal State Fullerton and UC Irvine, the main sources of 
new teachers for Orange County school districts, illustrate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Irvine, only six to 10 of 150 teachers who graduated this year had 
bilingual credentials, said Joan Bissell, assistant director of UCI's office of 
teacher education. Only 20 or so of Cal State Fullerton's teaching majors who 
graduated this year had bilingual credentials, said Prof. Carol Barnes, the 
university's coordinator of elementary and bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Snapped Up Quickly 
</P>
<P>
"If a district just waits for somebody who is bilingual to apply (for a job), 
they're not going to get them," Barnes said. "Our bilinguals are often snapped 
up by school districts where they did their student teaching or where they 
worked as an aide. I would think that many of our teachers are not even in the 
(job) market." 
</P>
<P>
And at UC Irvine and Cal State Fullerton, all of the bilingual teachers who 
graduated this year specialized in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
When schools cannot find teachers who speak specific languages, they cope by 
hiring aides -- often parents in the community -- to work alongside the teacher 
in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
When the state's bilingual law expired two years ago, the state Department of 
Education issued an advisory saying that because of other legal requirements, 
school districts were nevertheless obligated to comply with the intent of the 
law, which was to help students acquire sufficient English language ability to 
succeed in the regular school program. The bilingual law had required a 
certified bilingual teacher for every 10 limited-English students. 
</P>
<P>
Under current guidelines, school districts now have more flexibility for 
training and qualifying their own bilingual teachers or language development 
specialists -- instructors who aren't necessarily fluent in the primary 
language that their students speak. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, some districts have sought waivers from the state Department of 
Education, saying they cannot meet the guidelines by the fall, usually because 
of limited resources, materials or personnel. So far, seven Orange County 
school districts have filed for such waivers, and four of those are still 
awaiting state Board of Education approval. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback Unified is one of the four. Quezada said it had applied for the 
waiver "to give us a little bit of time to come up with our resources," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Flexibility 
</P>
<P>
The Garden Grove Unified School District has tried to take advantage of the new 
flexibility. Laura Schwalm, director of educational services, said that 25 of 
the district's teachers have bilingual credentials but that several others are 
in locally designed programs to get credentials or certification as language 
development specialists. 
</P>
<P>
With the wide diversity of languages spoken among the district's 7,000 
limited-English students, Schwalm said, the district is exploring teaching 
methods that do not rely so heavily on the state's bilingual-credentials 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing we are looking at is at what level of proficiency do (teachers) need 
to learn the Spanish language if they are teaching at the kindergarten level, 
for example," she said. "Now the district can set its own criteria." 
</P>
<P>
The heavy demand for certified bilingual teachers has led some districts to 
offer bonuses or stipends to entice job candidates. Los Angeles Unified School 
District pays up to $5,000 extra for certified bilingual teachers. Santa Ana 
Unified offers up to $1,400, and the Westminster School District gives up to 
$300. 
</P>
<P>
Some districts strongly oppose giving bonuses to bilingual teachers. "Why not 
give physics teachers a bonus too?" asked Garden Grove Supt. Ed Dundon. 
"They're hard to find too." 
</P>
<P>
Others say stipends can help alleviate the shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"If more districts did that, it might encourage more people to get into 
(bilingual teaching)," Cal State Fullerton's Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooperative Spirit 
</P>
<P>
Another solution to the teacher crisis is a new cooperative spirit between 
institutions of higher learning and public schools. More and more, it involves 
tapping the very people who have been helping teachers cope in their classrooms 
with limited-English students. 
</P>
<P>
Bissell said UCI has been working on a program with Santa Ana Unified, Cal 
State Fullerton, Rancho Santiago Community College in Santa Ana and Chapman 
College in Orange to encourage bilingual teacher aides to get not only their 
bachelor's teaching degrees, but also their certification in bilingual 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Gold, the state Department of Education's bilingual/bicultural consultant, 
said there is no doubt that the need for special instruction for 
limited-English students will continue to grow in California. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have 10 to 12 years of data on limited-English students, and we know 
the need will keep growing for at least the Spanish language," he said. "The 
growth has been less predictable for languages like Hmong, but there are now 
large numbers of students and kids in refugee camps all over the world, such as 
the Philippines, who we know are in the pipeline and who are probably going to 
end up here (in California). 
</P>
<P>
"There are children who will probably come here soon from Afghanistan, from 
Soviet Armenia and other areas of the world," he said. "The population in 
Orange County now is not that much different than in the rest of the state, so 
school districts there will also have to be prepared."

RIDING THE FAX: NOT GETTING THERE IS HALF THE FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County developer Karl Bergheer spends two weeks each month supervising 
the construction of a resort project in Hawaii, so he keeps in touch with his 
Newport Beach office and with another project in Las Vegas through his personal 
computer and his fax machines. Even his yacht has a fax. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't work without it," Bergheer said of the high-tech gear, which he was 
using on a recent afternoon on Maui to complete the purchase of property near 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, former state Coastal Commission member Fred Johnson can manage real 
estate projects in West Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area from his 
home in Santa Fe, N.M., where he can approve plans and deals via home computer 
and fax. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Seels, a computer programmer for Allergan Pharmaceuticals in Irvine, has 
been working at home in Mission Viejo several days each week for the last six 
years, a move prompted by a lack of office space at her company. She files the 
new software she creates into the company's mainframe computer through a modem, 
a device that allows the computer at her home to communicate with Allergan's 
mainframe over a telephone line. 
</P>
<P>
And revenue analyst Kathy Greenberg of La Crescenta in Los Angeles County works 
at home on a computer on Fridays to avoid the 100 miles of grueling freeway 
traffic she would otherwise encounter traveling to and from her office at 
Pacific Bell's computerized billing center in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Each of these people is telecommuting -- making use of commonly available 
technology to avoid unnecessary trips. 
</P>
<P>
Telecommuting is not new, but it is being promoted now more than ever before. 
It is one of the strategies the South Coast Air Quality Management District is 
encouraging as a way to reduce vehicle emissions in order to meet federal clean 
air standards by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic experts say that if telecommuting reduces home-to-work travel by 12% by 
the year 2000, there would be a 16.1% increase in the average morning-rush 
freeway speed -- from 31 m.p.h. to 36 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
And the AQMD projects that by the year 2000, such telecommuting would remove 
171 tons of reactive gases, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide and 
particulates that would otherwise be in Southern California's air every day. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, telecommuting has been slow to catch on among major employers, 
even in high-tech Orange County, where transportation officials see it 
affecting freeways the way icebreakers do frozen waterways. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics believe that the regional government agencies' goal -- the 
elimination of 20% of all work trips by telecommuting by 2010 -- is too 
ambitious, pointing to the number and kinds of people who have taken advantage 
of it so far. Writers telecommute, and consultants and programmers telecommute. 
Outside of those professions, some experts say, telecommuting has been limited 
to a few workers here and there and to the well-to-do entrepreneurs and 
business executives who can afford to change their life styles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans to Cut Traffic 
</P>
<P>
An impetus for more telecommuting is expected to come with the AQMD's 
controversial new Regulation 15, which requires employers of 100 or more to 
reduce the number of employees who drive to work alone during peak traffic 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
Under the regulation, employers face penalties of as much as $25,000 a day and 
a year in jail if they fail to submit adequate plans for achieving 
traffic-reduction goals. There is a rolling deadline for firms to submit plans 
through 1990, and some have already won approval for their Regulation 15 plans. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD staff, however, recently spot-checked 100 plans submitted by employers 
in Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties and found that 
only five had indicated that telecommuting would be a part of their overall 
effort. This even though employers were told that they could earn credits 
toward compliance with Regulation 15 if their employees use telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing," said AQMD spokeswoman Claudia Keith. "You would think 
that there would be more interest." 
</P>
<P>
But futurist and urban planning expert Jack Nilles of Los Angeles, a USC 
professor who is considered the "father of telecommuting" and who works as a 
telecommuting consultant from his home, said he is not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
The company people who put together the plans for meeting Regulation 15 "don't 
know what telecommuting is," he said. "This is what I sort of expected in the 
initial reaction. You have to convince the corporate managers to try it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arguments Against It 
</P>
<P>
The resistance among some company officials is strong, said Orange County 
Transit District planner Chris McKeever, because "they fear that they will lose 
control of their employees." 
</P>
<P>
However, McKeever said he believes that such fears can be overcome through 
management workshops, which OCTD sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Bonniksen, a spokeswoman for Pacific Bell, which has several Orange 
County employees telecommuting at least once a week, agrees that corporate 
managers have to be able to say: "I trust you. I have confidence that you'll 
get your job done." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Nilles said, it is simply easier for a company transportation director to 
offer workers other options such as an extra day off for joining a car pool or 
a van pool than it is to set up a telecommuting program from scratch -- even 
though telecommuting saves money and, as some experiments have shown, can 
increase productivity. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't caught on in a big way because we'll take a current pleasure rather 
than an imagined future pleasure," said Ray Catalano, a professor of social 
ecology at UC Irvine. "And right now I can tell you that it's more pleasurable 
to know that I can go to work, do my thing, pick up my paycheck and come home 
than thinking about what might happen to my company, my job and everything else 
to implement these air quality regulations." 
</P>
<P>
Some experts, Nilles among them, believe that prevailing estimates of how much 
telecommuting is going on -- 5% of the 108-million-person U.S. workforce -- are 
too low. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for that, he said, is that "a lot of people telecommute but don't 
realize that's what they're doing." Buying products over the telephone with a 
credit card, for instance, is telecommuting. So is using a home computer and 
modem to gain access to the catalogue for the UC Irvine main library. In 
addition, working out of a small branch office far from a company's urban 
headquarters is also considered a form of telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Projections 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that about 15 million to 25 million 
people could telecommute by the year 2008. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates argue that even telecommuting to work from home just one day a week 
will make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
But even among Orange County's high-tech firms, such as Hughes Aircraft Co. in 
Fullerton and TRW Inc. in Orange, there are no plans to boost telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
National security restrictions and the deployment of workers according to new 
team concepts makes telecommuting impractical for most of his employees, Hughes 
Aircraft Vice President William R. Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Said TRW spokeswoman Susan Murdy: "It's just not part of our (corporate) 
culture here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. Pilot Project 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city and county employees are about to embark on a major 
telecommuting pilot project, but there are no plans for a similar program in 
Orange County -- even though local government agencies are expected to reduce 
home-to-work trips among their staffs by 20% within two years. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who sits on both the AQMD and 
state Air Resources boards, said that, "given the greater number of employees 
the city and county of Los Angeles have combined, it's more appropriate for 
them to be embarking on this." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder said she is considering a telecommuting plan for county government 
employees but that she wants more information about the need for it and how it 
would work. 
</P>
<P>
She did say, though, "I just installed a fax machine in my home, and I'm amazed 
at the amount of work you can do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Cost, of course, is a consideration. Telecommuting equipment can be had 
relatively cheap, depending on how much computer memory is needed for the type 
of work to be done. Many companies, such as Allergan and Pacific Bell, will pay 
for the equipment that will be installed in the employee's home. Some personal 
computers cost less than $500, and a modem can be purchased for as little as 
$99. Portable fax machines are now going for less than $600. Software prices 
depend on the users' needs, but they can range from a few dollars for the 
so-called public domain programs that computer clubs and electronic bulletin 
boards circulate, to several hundred dollars for the big-name programs sold at 
retail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Means for Freedom 
</P>
<P>
For some people, telecommuting is the means that allows them to choose to live 
far from the work they are involved in. 
</P>
<P>
It is partly because of telecommuting that places such as Phoenix and Santa Fe 
have become extensions of Los Angeles and Orange counties, said Frank 
Hotchkiss, a futurist at the Southern California Assn. of Governments, a 
six-county regional planning agency. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Johnson, the former Coastal Commission member who recently moved to Santa 
Fe, said telecommuting -- especially by fax machine -- allows him to live where 
he wants. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Johnson, "the decision to move to some place like Santa Fe is not to 
be taken lightly. I was looking for an idyllic, natural environment, and the 
possibility of being driven to a life style as opposed to being career-driven. 
The reality is that telecommuting just isn't for everyone. People can 
romanticize about it, but whether it is Santa Fe or Aspen, the facts are that 
it is an incredible readjustment. You must conduct your life very differently. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
And, he adds, "the middle class may never have the flexibility to use it the 
way I did." 
</P>
<P>
One adjustment he had to make, Johnson said, was having to turn down some 
residential development projects that would have required too much personal 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
But when he does have to fly to California on business, Johnson adds, it often 
takes less time than a rush-hour car trip between West Los Angeles and south 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employee Fears 
</P>
<P>
Some experts warn that the work force will not be able to adapt to 
telecommuting as quickly as planners would like. They cite employee fears of 
isolation and lack of advancement, the risk of failure, and the possibility 
that unscrupulous employers may see telecommuting as a way to pay workers less 
and reduce employee insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
There are legal issues too. Some cities have zoning and building code 
restrictions that pertain to conducting businesses out of homes. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of Orange County telecommuters, however, reported no such problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It has worked out very well for me," said Mary Seels, the computer programmer 
who works for Allergan Pharmaceuticals. "The company decided to do this years 
ago because of a lack of office space. . . . I started out working at the 
kitchen table." 
</P>
<P>
Seels said she has no fear of being "out of sight, out of mind." After 
telecommuting several days each week for a while, she received a promotion. "I 
get up by 8 or 8:30 and work on through to about 1," she said. "And then I work 
at night. My husband works at night." 
</P>
<P>
Seels' also has a cat, Schizo, to keep her company. She joked that the 
refrigerator is always nearby too, but she adds, "I'm a Diet Coke drinker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Seven, 'It's Great' 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Kouba, one of Seels' supervisors, said telecommuting has worked well for 
the seven Allergan employees who do it. "When they get their work done is not 
as important as getting it done, and I know from checking their productivity 
that it's great," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Greenberg, who analyzes Pacific Bell's revenue fluctuations at home in La 
Crescenta on Fridays, said: "I usually work from 6 to 3. I'm usually in my robe 
until 9 or 10, because I just get up and telecommute. I don't break for lunch. 
. . . The momentum just keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said she leaves her "computer room" occasionally for a smoke, and she 
sometimes has to put her Doberman pinscher, Bear, outside if he becomes too 
feisty. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be your own whip-cracker," she said about working at home. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said telecommuting also allows her to keep the standing Friday dinner 
date she has with her husband with less hassle than before, when she was 
commuting the 46 miles (or 61 miles by an alternate route) from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Bergheer, the Orange County developer who uses telecommuting to supervise his 
out-of-state projects, also has several employees who telecommute from their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
As for himself, he is particularly fond of fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had gotten a fax sooner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He's even modifying the one on his boat. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now it only receives," Bergheer said. "I want it to send."

CARLSBAD CHIROPRACTOR ARRESTED IN TORCHING OF BONITA STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Carlsbad chiropractor was arrested in connection with arson at a Bonita store 
after a San Diego County sheriff's deputy saw a man setting the front of the 
store ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Sheriff's Department spokesman, Douglas L. Wofford, 41, was 
arrested Friday after being chased by the deputy. Wofford was being held on 
suspicion of arson in County Jail downtown. Bail was set at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Richard Yokley of the Bonita Fire Department said the fire at Bonita 
Market Liquor &amp; Deli started about 2:30 a.m. after a man set fire to a pile 
of newspapers that had been soaked with a flammable liquid outside the store. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy who made the arrest was patrolling when he saw a flash of light and 
a man leaving the scene. When the deputy ordered the man to stop, the man began 
running, Yokley said. 
</P>
<P>
A black swastika and the letters "SH" were found spray-painted in front of the 
store, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials speculated that the letters could stand for skinheads, who are white 
supremacists, but he said that skinhead activity is uncommon in Bonita. 
Authorities said they had no knowledge that Wofford is involved in any hate 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The swastika is unusual in the area," Yokley said. "It is a very 
community-oriented area and there have never been problems with skinheads." 
</P>
<P>
The store is owned by Sam Yousif of El Cajon, who police said is from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The contents of the store were destroyed in the fire, and the structure 
suffered partial damage. Overall damage was estimated at $200,000. Smoke also 
damaged a vacant building next door. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of the Fire Department, a Mass scheduled for Friday night at a 
nearby church was canceled because of fumes from the fire.

4 ESCAPE SERIOUS INJURY IN VAN NUYS AIRPORT CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A single-engine airplane carrying four people, including a 2-year-old boy, lost 
power and crashed into a hangar, a pickup truck and a parked World II-era plane 
shortly after taking off from Van Nuys Airport on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Those aboard the aircraft escaped serious injury, said Los Angeles Fire 
Department Capt. Bill Carter.

The small plane had taken off from the airport about 11:30 a.m., Carter said. 
When its engine lost power after climbing to a few hundred feet, the pilot 
tried to circle back to the runway for an emergency landing, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
But the plane came up short of the north-south runway, crashing in an aircraft 
parking area on the eastern side of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred just as Aviation Expo '89, an air show, was getting under 
way at the California Air National Guard base on the western side of the 
airport. The Piper aircraft had nothing to do with the show, which was not 
interrupted by the crash, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane struck the top of a sheet-metal hangar owned by Execuflite, a private 
jet service, before smashing into the cab of the truck and sliding into the 
fuselage of the parked World War II plane, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
John Ortega, 28, a manager for Execuflite, said he heard the impact while 
sitting in his office in a separate building. He said he ran 60 yards to the 
crash site with a fire extinguisher. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the lady trying to get out of the plane," Ortega said. "There was a lot 
of gasoline, and the passengers were in shock. 
</P>
<P>
"The lady was screaming, 'Oh my God, oh my God!' She was concerned about her 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that the plane might explode, Ortega said he quickly pulled out the 
pilot, who was unconscious and bleeding, the baby and another passenger. 
</P>
<P>
"As bad as it was, they were lucky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The passengers, who suffered cuts and bruises, were taken to Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Rex Long, 45, was treated and released, as were Justin Rulf, 2, and 
Kimberly Crawford, 24, a hospital spokeswoman said. Vincent Rulf, 59, was 
transferred to Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills with head injuries. 
He was in good condition, the Northridge spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Piper's wings were sheared off as it struck the hangar, and pieces of metal 
were scattered about the Tarmac near the crash. The fuselage of the Piper 
settled beneath the wing of the parked plane. 
</P>
<P>
The World War II-vintage plane was seriously damaged by the crash, said its 
owner, John Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Airport police cordoned off the crash site. Officials from the Federal Aviation 
Administration and National Transportation Safety Board were en route to the 
site late Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Piper's intended destination could not be immediately determined.

ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE FOR CARWASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN STEINBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Feeding on what some journalists describe as an insatiable appetite for stories 
about crackpot culture in sunbaked California, news organizations around the 
world have devoured a story about neighborhood efforts to have a Studio City 
carwash declared an architectural landmark. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, people from Peekskill, N. Y., to Paris have learned 
about one community's cry against a corner mini-mall. It has been a protest 
cloaked in a preservation campaign, and it has reinforced a well-accepted 
stereotype about the wacky West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing was a natural," said Arthur Higbee, editor of the American 
Topics column in the International Herald Tribune in Paris. "It was really one 
of our better items. I think it was one of the more amusing ones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seems Perfectly Normal' 
</P>
<P>
"Here's this city sort of designed for the automobile age," he said, "this city 
that's got, or once had, more drive-ins per capita than any other, probably 
more carwashes and gas stations than anywhere else. So it seems perfectly 
normal that someone would suggest turning a carwash into a monument. It 
wouldn't seem normal anywhere else, but it does in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the story is a community effort to thwart construction of a 
$15-million shopping center at Laurel Canyon and Ventura boulevards. The 
existing buildings, the carwash with its adjoining gas station and restaurant, 
would be destroyed to make way for the two-story mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
But the showdown between homeowners and developers, though noted in stories 
about the carwash, was generally buried or overshadowed by theatrics. 
</P>
<P>
Editors and reporters said they pursued the story because it was entertaining 
-- fun to write, broadcast, read and watch. And, they conceded, it played well 
to the zany notions that the public holds about the movie capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was a fruits-and-nuts piece," CNN Managing Editor Cissy Baker 
said. "We would have covered it if it were somewhere else. But I wasn't 
surprised it was in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times ran 14 stories about the carwash since the cultural 
campaign began in May, most of them in the San Fernando Valley edition. Two ran 
Thursday, the day after the city's Cultural Heritage Commission's decided that 
the 28-year-old complex did not qualify as a city treasure. 
</P>
<P>
Stories have also appeared in the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune and the 
Portland Oregonian. The magazine Business Week ran a short item in its current 
issue under the headline, "Only in California: A Landmark Carwash?" 
</P>
<P>
ABC, CBS and CNN carried the story. So did the "USA Today" television show, the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corp., an FM radio station in Sydney, Australia, and a 
television station in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Carwash owner Pat Galati -- whose relatives in the Hudson River town of 
Peekskill read of his struggle in the New York press -- thinks that the story 
plays to public outrage about overdevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"I was overwhelmed until I stopped to analyze it," Galati said. "Then I saw 
that people all over feel just as people in the state of California. They want 
to retain something of their heritage. They don't want all the changes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Right Buttons to Push 
</P>
<P>
It was the silly side of the story -- not the development issue -- that 
captured the attention of the press. And Jack McGrath, a savvy political 
strategist who headed the "Save Our Corner" campaign, knew all the right 
buttons to push. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing's better than the Statue of Liberty," he repeatedly told reporters, 
pointing to the boomerang-shaped beams that tower above the carwash. "The 
Gateway to Studio City," he called them. "If we had an Empire State Building in 
Los Angeles, we would make it a landmark. But our landmark is 55 feet in the 
air and made out of steel." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to save it, community activists appeared on the CBS Evening News 
in T-shirts bearing the "Save Our Corner" slogan. "Is there nothing sacred any 
more?" they sang. "Is our community going out the door?" 
</P>
<P>
David Browning, the CBS correspondent who reported the story, said for years 
that he has "put up with editors in New York who think all there is in L.A. is 
wackos and palm trees." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suggested Story 
</P>
<P>
But it was Browning, not his editors, who suggested the story. "Every city has 
its stereotypes," he said. "And everyone feeds on them once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Seth Mydans characterized his treatment of the story in the New York Times as a 
playful attempt to tell his readers about the love affair that Los Angeles 
residents have with their cars. 
</P>
<P>
"It has fun with cliches about Los Angeles," Mydans said. "The car culture. A 
little bit of outlandishness or garishness, as still perceived from outside. . 
. . I don't think there is any harm done by having fun with aspects of a 
culture. And one hopes that even in the heart of the fun, you're saying 
something that's true. I don't think the story is misrepresenting or skewing 
the realities of L.A. I think it's legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is a new city, still evolving, searching for a sense of history, 
the journalists agreed. It lacks the grand architecture of European cities and 
even of some cities on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Buursma of the Chicago Tribune, like Mydans, pursued that angle but not 
exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion that anyone in Philadelphia would ask an agency to declare as a 
historic monument something 20 years old is, on the face of it, ludicrous," 
Buursma said. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried not to treat the story as strictly a goofy California episode. It also 
spoke to something about neighborhood integrity, and a sense of community and 
the fact that you can rouse a bit of civic indignation in Southern California, 
when another one of the misconceptions is that people sit around and 
contemplate their navels and don't care about their neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coverage Deeper 
</P>
<P>
While the story appealed to correspondents and their editors because it 
depicted the zany side of Southern California, they said their coverage of the 
area runs much deeper. 
</P>
<P>
"If the entire body of my work consisted of nothing but carwash stories and 
quirky cultural artifacts of so-called California life style, I would be 
embarrassed," Buursma said. 
</P>
<P>
Many newspapers and television stations have no correspondents in California 
and learned of the carwash controversy from wire service reports. 
</P>
<P>
United Press International ran the story even though its Los Angeles-based 
Pacific region editor, Jacques Clafin, holds a dim view of such pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it personally distasteful to file stories that confirm a lot of notions 
that Easterners have about Californians being flaky," Clafin said. "I think 
California should be looked at as a bellwether state. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"These stories come up all the time. I had the same sense about the freeway 
shootings. There was no way not to run it. Yet I knew in running it, it would 
create in people's minds the impression that California is a lawless state. But 
we're not into censoring ourselves. As a Californian, as a Western person, you 
kind of hold your nose and file it."

50,000 ATTEND 1ST DAY OF AIR SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pilots looped and circled their vintage propeller-driven planes over Van Nuys 
Airport while young children playfully inspected multimillion-dollar jet 
fighters and bombers on the ground at the Aviation Expo '89 air show Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police estimated that 50,000 people attended the first day of the 
two-day event, which included a tribute to flyers and engineers who have 
contributed to San Fernando Valley aviation history, including a pioneer female 
aviator who performed at the opening of the airport in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great. You don't have to spend money, it's good for the family, and 
it's educational," said Alejandro Miranda of San Fernando, who brought his son, 
Alex Jr., 4, and his wife, Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
For Alex Jr., the highlight of the show was his tour of the huge KC-10 tanker, 
a modified DC-10. "They let me go in the cockpit," he said, holding a plastic 
model of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the crowd were military veterans who came to show their families the 
planes and helicopters that they had seen or flown during the Vietnam and 
Korean wars. Others worked in Southern California's aerospace industry and 
wanted to admire the fruits of their labor. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Nungary inspected the sleek B-1B bomber, the most technically advanced in 
the U. S. arsenal. He said he worked on the plane when he was a research 
machinist at Rockwell International. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the most beautiful thing that's ever flown," Nungary said. The 
retired machinist said he didn't know that the plane would be at the air show 
until he saw it fly over his Van Nuys home Friday afternoon. "I'd never seen it 
fly before. I saw it landing, and I came over here." Soldiers at the California 
Air National Guard told him about the show, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy veteran Jack Fisher, 46, was also impressed by the B-1B, which he admired 
as he drank a few beers. "I walked around it for five beers," he said. Fisher 
bought a B-1B cap, decorating it with a pin depicting the Navy P-3 Orion 
aircraft that he flew in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The B-1B was only one of 50 aircraft displayed at the show. At the other end of 
the airfield, Navy Lt. Gary (Lefty) Gomez gladly fielded questions from a dozen 
people gathered around the F-14 Tomcat jet fighter that he pilots. "They ask 
me, 'How fast does it go? How much does it cost?' They're good taxpayers," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The jet fighter costs $32 million, give or take a million, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the flying exhibition began, Van Nuys Airport spokesman Robert 
Hayes presented Aces in Aviation awards to half a dozen distinguished flyers 
and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Walen, "the oldest flight instructor at Van Nuys Airport," received an 
award for having trained "most of the pilots in the Valley," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
"The best advantage of teaching flying is meeting pretty ladies," Walen, 83, 
said after receiving his certificate. "It goes with the job." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbi Trout, also 83, received the Historical Achievement Award. Trout flew a 
Golden Eagle monoplane during an exhibition when Van Nuys Airport opened in 
1928. She also completed a 12-hour solo endurance flight at the airport in 
1929. 
</P>
<P>
"What a difference 61 years makes," she said. "Back then, there was nothing but 
walnut and peach groves here." 
</P>
<P>
Another honoree, Air Force Capt. Steve Ritchie, accepted his award in the name 
of the "hundreds and hundreds" of support personnel -- mechanics and air 
traffic controllers -- he worked with as a fighter pilot in Vietnam. Ritchie 
was the only pilot declared an ace during the war, a distinction that he won 
for shooting down five MIG-21 fighters. 
</P>
<P>
"To have survived and been victorious is a credit to their work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trout and Ritchie later joined the crowd in watching "Top Guns of Yesteryear," 
a flying exhibition of World War II-era fighter planes. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are pretty neat," Jimmy Rosenfeld, 8, of Thousand Oaks, said as he 
watched two P-51 Mustangs buzz the airfield. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some were disappointed by the show, which included a water drop by a 
C-130 transport plane used to fight fires. 
</P>
<P>
"Are they going to fly any planes from my war?" asked Lou Dafner of Tarzana, a 
Vietnam veteran. "Everything here is from World War II. That's way before my 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Ted Hanson said crowds Saturday were half the size of last year's 
show, which attracted about 100,000 people each day. Some may have been kept 
away by the heat, which was more than 90 degrees in the shade. By late 
afternoon, three people had fainted from exposure, Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
The free show continues today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Poland's new-style leadership gave an unusual look to Saturday's Communist 
National Day when newly elected President Wojciech Jaruzelski reviewed troops 
alongside a member of the once-banned Solidarity trade union. 
</P>
<P>
In a scene unthinkable even at last year's July 22 ceremony to mark the 1944 
birth of the forerunner of Poland's first Communist government, Solidarity's 
Andrzej Stelmachowski stood next to Jaruzelski on the reviewing stand. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski, in his general's uniform, watched troops from a podium on central 
Warsaw's Victory Square before laying a wreath at the nearby Tomb of the 
Unknown Soldier. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Communist leader's first major public engagement as president, since 
he was elected to the post with the narrowest possible margin Wednesday in an 
uncontested vote in the National Assembly.

He set out a five-point blueprint: protection of social stability, higher food 
production, desert reclamation, education reform and economic liberalization.

Addressing party supporters on the eve of the 37th anniversary of the 1952

COUNTY'S PROPOSED SALES TAX INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is the worst of times and definitely not the best of times. With 
California's unemployment and inflation on the perpetual upward, it is 
unjustifiable for the public to bear the burden of a transit tax. 
</P>
<P>
In solving its dilemma, the Orange County Transportation Commission has 
proposed a half-cent sales tax increase to help finance its $11-billion 
projects. Orange Countians will not be enchanted with the idea and again will 
voice their outrage at the polls Nov. 7 just as they defeated 1984 Measure A. 
It is extremely critical that federal transportation dollars be invested in 
building light-rail systems that offer convenient transportation alternatives 
to the auto. The frightening fact is that Los Angeles is one of the most 
severely polluted cities in the United States -- a problem related to total 
auto use, created after it ripped up its regional transit system in the late 
'40s. 
</P>
<P>
The most important point is that we must not continue to invest in highways to 
promote growth of vehicle miles traveled. We must find a lasting solution to 
reduce the high level of carbon combustion in the transportation sector. 
Commuters who travel the Southland's congested roadways are exposed to toxins 
in their cars, thus the risk of cancer is much greater. The public's 
self-interest lies in safeguarding the urban environment, creating a healthy 
place to live for many future generations.

CONFRONTATION AT TUSTIN'S ABORTION CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times article on the July 8 confrontation at the Tustin abortion clinic 
(July 9) contained misleading statements, such as: "Nearly 1,000 anti-abortion 
activists and pro-choice advocates taunted one another," and "Overall, the 
Tustin demonstration was largely nonviolent, although tempers flared and a few 
people reported minor injuries from shoving matches." 
</P>
<P>
Of these estimated 1,000 participants, only 150 to 200 were anti-choice (it was 
easy enough to figure out who was on which side). The shoving did not result 
from flaring tempers, nor was it incidental. It resulted from Operation 
Rescue's calculated strategy of trying to push the clinic defenders out of the 
way in order to take their place and close the clinic, and from the pro-choice 
group's concerted refusal to be pushed aside.

CONFRONTATION AT TUSTIN'S ABORTION CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was heartening to be part of the Pro-Choice Majority at the Tustin Clinic on 
July 8. I was, however, dismayed to read in The Times that "each group declared 
it was the victor." The true victors were the patients who successfully 
obtained the health care they sought, thanks to the support of those of us who 
don't believe that religion should dictate our laws. 
</P>
<P>
I was also confused when I read in The Times that the "Tustin demonstration was 
largely nonviolent." I was there, and I saw people being pushed and shoved in a 
very violent manner. I was there and saw one woman jabbed so hard in the 
stomach that she couldn't catch her breath -- just one of many instances of 
violence initiated by anti-choice demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
I commend the Tustin clinic personnel who, despite their busy schedule that 
day, took those injured people into the clinic and tended them. Please don't 
perpetuate the myth that Operation Rescue people are nonviolent. I've seen them 
for the fanatic, violent group they are because I was there.

MAYOR'S ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The citizens of Fountain Valley should not be represented by an elected 
official who willfully and knowingly violates the law while holding public 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest and conviction of Mayor Fred Voss has cast a shadow on the entire 
community. If we allow this issue to be glossed over, it raises the very 
serious question of potential problems that may arise in the future. What 
eventually becomes an acceptable standard of conduct? 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, the Fountain Valley City Council adopted Resolution No. 5081, which 
reads in part: "Public officials and employees are bound to observe in their 
official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the 
duties of their offices regardless of personal consideration, recognizing that 
the public interests must be their primary concern, that conduct in both their 
official and private affairs should be above reproach." 
</P>
<P>
At the present time, we seem to have a "code of silence" prevailing in our City 
Council chambers rather than an observation or acknowledgement of a code of 
ethics. 
</P>
<P>
If, in fact, our elected officials have the power to make all of the decisions 
affecting what does or does not occur or become law in our city, why are they 
powerless (silent) on this issue?

HOMEMAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To answer Linda S. Moon's concern (Letters, July 16) that the traditional 
full-time homemaker will be "ill-prepared" to be financially productive should 
divorce, death or disability of her spouse thrust her into the work force, I 
would like to say that as a full-time homemaker I am not naive about those 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
My motivation as a full-time homemaker is focused on meeting my family's daily 
needs and nurturing my children to be the future leaders of our country. 
Putting the kids in day care, buying TV dinners and juggling a career and 
family just in case disaster strikes is a fear I don't live with. 
</P>
<P>
Truthfully, I am willing to sacrifice material comforts today and live with the 
risk that disability or death may happen someday to give my family my time and 
energy. I don't think you can put a price tag on what I am doing by staying 
home. 
</P>
<P>
My role is to support my husband in his job as breadwinner and to make my home 
a pleasant refuge for him from the stress of the world. It could be that by 
staying home, I am contributing to his longevity. If I take good care of him, 
he might be around longer and I'll never have to work outside the home. Time 
will tell. 
</P>
<P>
In saying that I am "ill-prepared" to go back to work, Ms. Moon misses the 
point of my letter which was to tell the world that the full-time homemaker is 
alive and well in Orange County. She says that "at some time most of them will 
be forced by necessity to contribute to their own support and that of their 
families," and that statistics support this claim. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to challenge that claim. One of my concerns with the media today 
is its lack of verification. The original Times story mentioned the so-called 
disappearance of the full-time homemaker who "isn't there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Who says the full-time homemaker isn't there and who says "most women" will 
have to work someday? 
</P>
<P>
A lot of us who are full-time homemakers have degrees, work out of our homes 
and sometimes help our husbands in their businesses. We have a lot of 
experience in home administration. 
</P>
<P>
I believe working wives do cause divorces. Ask the marriage counselors. 
Competition with husbands, independence, financial security and another man are 
factors in marriage break-ups. 
</P>
<P>
If we don't stay home to rock the cradle carrying the next generation, then who 
will?

MAN SHOT DURING ARGUMENT IN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was in critical condition Saturday night after he was shot during an 
argument in Balboa Park, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce E. Miller, 25, was being held for questioning late Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lt. Lee Staley, Miller and Sefo Ione, age unknown, became involved 
in an argument at Park Boulevard and Presidents Way about 7:40 p.m. Miller 
allegedly pulled a pistol from his pocket and fired two or three shots at Ione, 
striking him in the arm and leg, Staley said. The assailant then fled. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was stopped at 10th Avenue and Ash Street downtown by police who had 
heard a radio description of the suspect, Staley said. He added that Miller was 
carrying a pistol when he was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know yet if he'll be booked on attempted murder or assault with a 
deadly weapon," he said. "We don't yet know the motive." 
</P>
<P>
Ione was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center, where he was in surgery in 
critical condition, according to a hospital spokesman.

PADRES SHOW BAD SIDE TO NEW PLAYER; 
</P>
<P>
THEY GET FIVE HITS IN LOSING 3RD IN ROW TO ST. LOUIS, 5-2

<TEXT>
<P>
When the phone rang at 8 this morning, jarring Mike Pagliarulo out of a sound 
sleep, he sensed this was going to be a miserable day. 
</P>
<P>
Who could be calling him this early, he thought. Some long-lost friend looking 
for tickets for the night's New York Yankee-Texas Ranger game? Or maybe some 
pesky autograph seeker who had the nerve to call him? 
</P>
<P>
"Hello." 
</P>
<P>
"Mike, this is Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
Silence. 
</P>
<P>
This was not good. It's never customary for your manager to call you, but when 
it's before breakfast, you know there's trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo shut his eyes, fighting the tears as the words came out of Dallas 
Green's mouth. He was being traded by the Yankees, shipped 3,000 miles away 
from the team he loved and city he cherished. 
</P>
<P>
Too choked up to tell his teammates, Pagliarulo quietly checked out of the team 
hotel in Dallas with his wife and 2-year-old son. He caught the next flight to 
San Diego. Caught a cab. Checked into another hotel. Caught a cab going to the 
ballpark. Got measured for a uniform and cap. Borrowed a pair of Luis Salazar's 
shoes. Stepped into the starting lineup at third base. And went hitless in 
three at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
So you can just imagine Pagliarulo's mood when reporters descended upon him 
after the Padres' 5-2 defeat, asking just what happened when he killed the 
Padres' last chance to tie the game in the seventh inning by striking out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I feel right now," he said. "I feel like I'm still in the 
air. I'm confused today." 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo, who has lived in the East all his life, never bothered to follow 
the National League. Not while growing up. Not while in college. Not even in 
the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to pick up their (Padre) box score this morning just to see who my 
teammates are," Pagliarulo said. "I never followed the National League. I know 
a few of these guys because they played in New York, but like the Cardinals, I 
don't know anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I know (Tom) Brunansky. He plays for them, doesn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo not only learned that Brunansky plays for the Cardinals, watching 
him hit his seventh home run in 11 games at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, but 
found out a whole lot more about their pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
He knew a little about Cardinal starter Ted Power (2-4), who pitched briefly 
with the Kansas City Royals last season, but that didn't seem to help when he 
went hitless in his first two at-bats, reaching base only on third baseman 
Terry Pendleton's error. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he felt encouraged when he stepped to the plate in the seventh. The 
Padres, trailing 3-1, had runners on first and second with two outs. Here was 
Pagliarulo with the chance to be a hero in front of the 27,567 fans, making his 
National League debut a night to remember. 
</P>
<P>
Well, wouldn't you know that Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog decided to make 
Pagliarulo's day a little more difficult. He went to the bullpen and summoned 
left-hander Frank DiPino. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo, a left-handed hitter, seldom was allowed to face left-handed 
pitchers while with the Yankees. With his career .190 batting average against 
lefties entering the season, and a .242 average with nine strikeouts in 33 
at-bats against left-handers in '89, Green's reluctance to allow Pagliarulo to 
face them was understandable. 
</P>
<P>
"But I got him to bat against righties and lefties," Padre Manager Jack McKeon 
said. "I want to give him some confidence." 
</P>
<P>
So there he was, facing a pitcher he never even heard of, seeing pitches that 
he's never seen from him. 
</P>
<P>
Being extremely patient, Pagliarulo worked the count to three-two. He had 
DiPino right where he wanted him. He was looking for a fastball. DiPino threw a 
slider. 
</P>
<P>
Strike three. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the National League. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Pagliarulo only needed to look around the clubhouse to find plenty 
of soul mates. The Padres managed only five hits, three of them off Power. In 
three games this series against the Cardinals, the Padre offense now produced 
three runs and 13 hits in 27 innings, batting .140. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres had little difficulty accepting their defeat to Joe Magrane on 
Thursday. And they could even see losing to Jose DeLeon. But Ted Power, a guy 
who had allowed 20 earned runs in 19 2/3 innings in his previous five starts 
this season? 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I look in the box score," McKeon said, "he's going 1 2/3, 2 and 2 
1/3 innings. I'm not taking anything away from Ted Power, but we made Power 
look real good. We're making some of these guys look like Cy Young. 
</P>
<P>
"Their pitchers are not getting us out; we're getting ourselves out. They could 
bounce it up there, and we would swing at it." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Padre starter Greg Harris, he did not have the luxury of 
being able to face the Padre hitters. And he realized the difference on the 
first pitch, when Willie McGee lined a double past first baseman Jack Clark 
into the right-field corner. Milt Thompson followed by hitting a 2-0 pitch into 
deep center. The ball appeared playable, but center fielder Marvell Wynne 
misjudged the ball and broke in. By the time he realized his mistake, it was 
too late. The ball dropped over his head, and by the time he retrieved it, 
Thompson was rounding second and on his way to third. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, appearing rattled, then walked Pedro Guerrero on five pitches. He got 
out of the inning when Tom Brunansky grounded into a double play, scoring 
Thompson, and Terry Pendleton struck out. 
</P>
<P>
It was plenty enough to hold off the Padres, who didn't score their second run 
until the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
As Pagliarulo also found out on his first night on the job, these are not the 
Bronx Bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres do not need to make a roster move until new pitcher Don Schulze 
joins them in Cincinnati. Padre Manager Jack McKeon said the organization has 
yet to discuss who'll be sent down to their triple-A club in Las Vegas, but 
outfielder Shawn Abner and pitcher Fred Toliver appear to be the leading 
candidates. . . . Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn went hitless for the second 
consecutive game for only the third time this season. His batting average 
dropped to .339, one point lower than Barry Larkin of the Cincinnati Reds . . . 
Second baseman Joey Cora of the Padres' triple-A club in Las Vegas extended his 
hitting streak to 36 games with hits in each game of their double-header. It's 
the longest hitting streak in professional baseball this season.

HOW IS THIS FOR A COMPARISON: METS OF OLD AND ORIOLES ANEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY KORNHEISER, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comparisons like these -- one team from 1969, the other from 1989 -- are hokey 
to begin with. So much can happen in 20 years. So many changes. Twenty years 
ago, for example, The Who was still a touring rock band. 
</P>
<P>
But let's suppose you sense a similarity between the 1969 Mets and these 1989 
Orioles. Not that you automatically would -- Frank Robinson, just to pull a 
name out of thin air, doesn't. "I can't talk about the '69 Mets. I only saw 
them five ballgames," Robinson deadpanned, remembering the outrageous 
undressing of his Orioles in that World Series. But for the sake of argument, 
apart from the obvious -- that both teams were 200-1 shots going into the 
season -- what basis would there be for the comparison? 
</P>
<P>
Not pitching. The Mets starters were awesome, rotating Tom Seaver, Jerry 
Koosman, Gary Gentry and Don Cardwell, and spotting Nolan Ryan and Jim 
McAndrew. Together, Seaver (2.21 ERA) and Koosman (2.28) were 42-16 with 34 
complete games and 11 shutouts; the full staff had 28 shutouts, most in the 
last 20 years. The Orioles starters are underwhelming; indeed, their 
acknowledged ace, Jeff Ballard, has looked like a candidate for Class AAA the 
last month and a half. It's the bullpen, most prominently Gregg Olson and Mark 
Williamson (who've had a hand in 41 of the 53 victories) that's keeping their 
powder dry. 
</P>
<P>
Not fielding. Notwithstanding spectacular World Series catches by Ron Swoboda 
and Tommie Agee, the Mets, with 122 errors, were an average defensive team. The 
Orioles are brilliant. More than halfway through the season they've made 48 
errors, and are threatening the record low yield of 84. 
</P>
<P>
Not hitting. The Mets hit .242, third least in the National League. The Orioles 
are batting .262, and lead the American League in runs per game. The Mets poked 
a measly 109 home runs. The Orioles already have 79. 
</P>
<P>
So why compare them? 
</P>
<P>
Because it's the same story. 
</P>
<P>
Because in spirit, they're twins. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't expected to win," Ed Kranepool recalled. "But we kept winning, 
winning, winning. One day we were the laughingstock of the league, and the next 
day we were champions." 
</P>
<P>
The Amazing Mets. 
</P>
<P>
The Inexplicable O's. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Mets and Orioles were chock full of kids -- average age 27 -- and 
bereft of big stars. The Orioles have Cal Ripken Jr. That's one more than the 
Mets had. Kranepool had already been around forever, but was no great shakes. 
Seaver and Koosman had yet to win 20. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams got vital, even startling offensive contributions from unexpected 
sources. The Mets got a career year from Cleon Jones, who hit .340, 59 points 
above his average. The Orioles already have 21 homers and 53 RBI from Mickey 
Tettleton, who'd never done better than 11 and 37. 
</P>
<P>
Unacclaimed hitters like Agee, Jerry Grote, Ken Boswell and Art Shamsky had 
their most productive seasons in 1969. Players who'd soon fade from sight, 
journeymen like Al Weis, J.C. Martin, Wayne Garrett and Bobby Pfeil, banged 
timely hits. It's too soon to know what kind of careers Steve Finley, Randy 
Milligan, Brady Anderson and Mike Devereaux will have, but the analogy breathes 
for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
The overriding thing that links these teams is the pervasive sense that they're 
in the midst of doing something extraordinary, something mythical. As the Mets 
did then, the Orioles go onto the field every game thinking they can win. 
They've beaten Clemens, Viola, Ryan and Stewart. Who'd have thunk it? "Maybe 
it's the attitude that's so similar," said Al Jackson, who's in the impossibly 
coincidental position of being the '89 Orioles' pitching coach and having 
pitched briefly for the '69 Mets. Pieces fall into place. A manager proves his 
player was hit by a pitch by showing an umpire the shoe polish scuff on the 
ball; a phantom home run wins a game; a ground rule double sends the tying run 
back to third. The cavalry arrives in the nick of time. The Mets got Donn 
Clendenon from Montreal in midseason. The Orioles have dialed Rochester for 
emergency pitching patchwork, and Jay Tibbs, Mike Smith, Mickey Weston and Mark 
Huismann are 8-0 with two saves. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, there was a regular who sat on the third base side of Shea, holding up 
his hand-painted signs. One said, "God Is Alive And Living In Queens." It's 20 
years. Maybe He's renting in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
It's not an exact parallel. After chasing the Cubs all summer, the Mets finally 
touched first place on Sept. 10; the Orioles have camped there the last 54 
straight days. As rude as the Mets were in 1968, finishing 16 under .500, the 
1988 Orioles were lead weights, sinking 53 under. But the essence and the 
spirit of the turnarounds are the same. It's the American Dream, the 
preoccupation with longshots. 
</P>
<P>
The signature game for the Mets came on Sept. 15. The Cardinals' Steve Carlton 
struck out 19 of them, a record then -- and Swoboda hit two two-run dingers to 
beat him, 4-3. From that point on only a fool would disbelieve. If the Orioles 
go on to win the pennant, last weekend's back-to-back, Deavereaux-Tettleton, 
fair-or-foul cardiac comebacks against the Angels will be their signature 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Not that everybody's a believer. Skeptics abound. Were Robinson managing 
another AL club he might add his voice to the herd. "I've been in positions 
like this before," Robinson explained, "watching an unexpected team jump out. 
And I've said, 'I'm glad they're out there, and not so and so. They're going to 
come back to the pack.' But I'll tell you what. After a point you'd better step 
back and reconsider. Those guys aren't going to quit. They're not going to come 
back to us. We've got to catch them." Robinson leaned back comfortably in his 
soft leather chair. "California left here and said, 'Their pitching won't hold 
up. It won't last through September.' Maybe so. But I'm glad they're taking 
that attitude." His eyes half-closed, a serene smile on his lips, Robinson said 
with a lilt, "Look up in September and we may not need that pitching."

Lou Dials and Bobby Robinson were majestic baseball players of the 1930s who 
may have been on a par with Lou Gehrig, Mel Ott and Jimmie Foxx, but few fans 
ever heard of them. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is they spent their entire careers shuttling around Negro League 
cities on run-down buses, staying in shabby hotels, receiving low pay and 
getting little recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Used to black stars such as Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Ernie Banks and Tony 
Gwynn, it is difficult now for Americans to imagine a time when the sport was 
not integrated. 
</P>
<P>
But from 1887 until 1947 there was the all-white major leagues -- and its 
minor-league system -- and the Negro Leagues for blacks and Hispanics, as 
baseball mirrored segregated America. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of black players could have played in the majors then. We'd watch the 
Tigers play and I can remember a third baseman for Detroit -- he couldn't touch 
me playing third," Bobby Robinson, now, 85, said in a recent interview from his 
Chicago home. 
</P>
<P>
"Their manager said if I was a white boy, I would be the Tigers' third baseman. 
I thought about that. It made me feel bad," said Robinson. "White boys made 
more money, but it was more than that -- it was the pride." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, black and white teams would play exhibitions between seasons in the 
1930s and 1940s, and the blacks did well in those games, both players 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"The whites were afraid that if they allowed Negroes to play on the same team 
with them, the Negroes would dominate the game like they do football and 
basketball," said Dials, also 85. 
</P>
<P>
Dials, a star outfielder and first baseman, broke in with Rube Foster's Chicago 
American Giants in 1925, and also played for the Memphis Red Sox, Detroit 
Stars, Cleveland Giants and New York Black Yankees in the Negro Leagues. 
</P>
<P>
In 1943 -- three years before Jackie Robinson played for Montreal -- Dials, 
then 39, was one of three black players offered contracts from the Los Angeles 
franchise in the white Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
"But a week before spring training, they told me another team wouldn't let me 
sign, and there was no place for me no matter how good I was." 
</P>
<P>
Dials said he was glad when Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. 
</P>
<P>
"I only wish it had been me. I'm quite sure I could have done the same thing," 
said Dials, a resident of Modesto, Calif., who was in Chicago earlier this 
summer for the National Sports Collectors Convention. "But I don't know if I 
could have handled the heckling Jackie had to go through." 
</P>
<P>
At the convention, Tom Kloessler of Milwaukee was one of many collectors lining 
up to get Dials' autograph. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has a good shot at getting into the Hall of Fame, and I collect 
Hall of Fame signatures," Kloessler explained. 
</P>
<P>
Dials, a 1927 University of California graduate in electrical engineering, 
thinks his election to the Hall may come next year. 
</P>
<P>
Many records were lost from the old days, but Dials was credited with winning 
the National League batting title in 1931 with a .382 average, leading the 
Detroit Stars to the Negro championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I caught the last out of the championship game," said Bobby Robinson. "I had 
all the players on our team sign the ball. I still have it, and me and Lou are 
the only ones still alive." 
</P>
<P>
Dials and Robinson -- void of bitterness despite playing under racial bias or 
what was called Jim Crow -- look back over their playing days with fond 
memories. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no regrets being a baseball player. I think about that time every day," 
said Robinson. "I'd like to see the players one more time." 
</P>
<P>
Dials said the toughest pitcher he ever faced was Wilbert "Bullet" Rogan. 
"Without a doubt. Casey Stengel said the same thing," said Dials. 
</P>
<P>
The best all-around ballplayer, according to Dials, was Martin DiHigo. 
</P>
<P>
"He could pitch, he could hit," said Dials. "He was a Cuban who played in the 
Negro Leagues." 
</P>
<P>
DiHigo is among about a dozen oldtime Negro League players admitted to the Hall 
of Fame since Cooperstown's officials decided to try to right some of 
baseball's wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
The Negro Leagues had plenty of hardships. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty rough traveling by bus, and playing so many games -- sometimes 
two or three games a day," Bobby Robinson said. "You'd ride all night and get 
up the next day and play." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson broke in with the Indianapolis ABCs in 1925, and later played for the 
Cleveland Elites, Memphis Red Sox, Detroit Stars, Cleveland Stars and Cleveland 
Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"The most I ever made was between $300 and $400 a month, plus meal money -- 
$1," said Robinson, a brick mason after baseball. "You could get ham and eggs 
then for 30 cents." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, their salaries were two or three times greater than those of black workers 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Dials still fills with pride over breakthroughs by blacks in and out of sports, 
including this season's first meeting between black major-league managers, 
Frank Robinson's Baltimore Orioles and Cito Gaston's Toronto Blue Jays in June. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel elated. Those guys paid their dues," said Dials, who now 
promotes a line of Negro League baseball cards. 
</P>
<P>
He think his baseball life may have helped him live longer. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't smoke or drink coffee," he added.

COOKE'S EYES TURN TO THE WEST, HEART REMAINS WITH REDSKINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is uncharacteristic time at Redskin Park, so many people being shuffled. 
Charley Casserly has moved into Bobby Beathard's office, John Kent Cooke has 
moved into Beathard's territory and owner Jack Kent Cooke apparently has a van 
headed West. 
</P>
<P>
Up the road RFK Stadium may soon qualify as a romantic monument, as the senior 
Cooke appears resolute in his plans to construct a spacious replacement stadium 
by 1992 or 1993. Just because there are persistent rumors he'll sell the team 
and just because he's reportedly transporting his more lavish paintings in 
Middleburg to a new estate in Bel Air, Calif., doesn't mean he's deserting the 
stadium effort. His private jet allows him to cross the country in the span of 
an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
California seems to appeal more and more to Cooke, 76, and it is possible the 
majority of his time now will be spent in the sweeping Bel Air hills. Cooke has 
not answered questions from Washington Post sports writers for nearly a year, 
and would not be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
However sources indicate it's expected he would migrate to California for late 
winter and summer, but be back by fall for his beloved football season. If he 
does sell his Kent Farms home in Virginia -- he has said he will not, though 
sources said he may unload some grassy acreage near the house-he merely would 
find an apartment for football season. And he particularly admires Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
About the rumors concerning the sale of the Redskins, these same sources close 
to Cooke say he's had offers, because the team is so successful, but they 
maintain a deal in the near future is not viable. Besides, the unofficial price 
is a reported $146 million, steeper than what Jerry Jones dished out recently 
for the Dallas Cowboys and Texas Stadium ($140 million). 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, John Kent Cooke, the owner's son, has just moved into a $2 million 
townhome in Georgetown and he doesn't plan on relocating any time soon. Sources 
close to the family note that John would move to New York to work in his 
father's Chrysler Building or to Los Angeles if the team were on the block. 
</P>
<P>
But who will wear what hats in Redskins management as the 1990s approach? 
Beathard, the flip-flopped general manager, resigned in May, his duties turned 
over to 40-year-old Casserly, who has floppy hair, a New JerseyBoston drawl and 
a lot of smarts. Casserly seemingly is in Beathard's mold, a scout-turned-GM 
who looks for gimmicks and innovative contract clauses. 
</P>
<P>
Casserly is different from Beathard in that he's more self-made, a former high 
school coach. George Young, the New York Giants' productive general manager, 
similarly began as a high school educator. For the last few years, Casserly was 
an assistant general manager working from a nondescript cubicle. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the fear for Casserly is Beathard's giant shadow and what might 
happen should the team slip. He has said he is not staying up at night 
worrying. 
</P>
<P>
"But hey," says Young, "Charley shouldn't have to take that. None of us are 
irreplaceable! That's a misconception. Bobby brought a lot of good people in 
there, and so did Joe (Gibbs, the coach). It's not one man. There's only one 
Napoleon, and the French haven't figured out if he was a good thing or a bad 
thing, frankly. 
</P>
<P>
"The question becomes whether the man makes the times or the times make the 
man. You'd never have great generals without the wars ... Bobby had a good 
organization, good coaches, good players. It's not a one-man deal. I shudder 
when I hear the word genius. Not in pro football! If you're gonna be a genius, 
be it in something that helps people. This is just the entertainment business." 
</P>
<P>
Down the hall from Casserly is his immediate boss, John Kent Cooke, who is 
rapidly gaining esteem league-wide. Evidence is Commissioner Pete Rozelle's 
placement of Cooke this week on the new commissioner search committee. 
</P>
<P>
New York Giants owner Wellington Mara, co-chairman of the committee, said he 
remembers in past years that Beathard was Jack Kent Cooke's right-hand man at 
league meetings. But nowadays John Kent Cooke is stepping into Beathard's 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"He's presented himself forcefully," Mara said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to John Kent Cooke, however, maintain he's always played a role 
behind the scenes. Cynics wonder if he knows sports, but he was associated with 
the Los Angeles Lakers and Kings and is now the heir to the Redskins throne. In 
a recent article in the Fauquier Citizen, his father was quoted as saying his 
son has "growing responsibilities with the football team." 
</P>
<P>
But, make no mistake, the elder Cooke is pre-eminent in terms of all team 
affairs. Even with the expected move to Bel Air, this does not figure to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Mara has noticed, "(Jack Kent Cooke) hasn't attended many league meetings." 
Apparently they bore him. League officials remember the year he attended one 
morning session in New York and owners haggled over whether to fine teams if 
their players didn't pull up their socks -- then left in a huff. Nobody knew 
why. As it turned out he'd bought the Chrysler Building that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
He's won Super Bowls; so, apparently, his last challenge in sports is building 
this new stadium, which likely is to bear his name -- a la Miami's Joe Robbie. 
Yet the status of this stadium is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
According to Artis Hampshire-Cowan, legal counsel of the Armory Board, Cooke is 
supposed to produce a site plan any time now. It's a sensitive issue, actually. 
At every meeting between Cooke's people and the Armory people, Cowan said she 
asks where the stadium site plan might be. No one says.

WHERE TEE TIME IS LIKE RUSH HOUR; 
</P>
<P>
GOLFERS WILL DO ALMOST ANYTHING TO GET A ROUND IN AT BUSY SOUTH BAY COURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRYL LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Golf, a sport designed primarily for recreation, is turning into anything but a 
relaxing experience at South Bay public courses. 
</P>
<P>
The problem simply is too many golfers and too few courses. 
</P>
<P>
"You're taking a chance trying to get a tee time," said Don Provine, L.A. 
County Parks and Recreation assistant golf director. "It's really rough out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Provine is referring to tee-off slots at public golf courses such as Harbor, 
Los Verdes and Westchester -- courses bearing the brunt of a growing golf 
frenzy in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles city public courses are the busiest in the United States. There 
are more rounds played on our courses that any other city in America," says Al 
Goldfarb, public relations director for the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The national average for U.S. public courses last year was 38,019 rounds 
played, according to the National Golf Foundation. L.A.'s 13 public courses 
averaged about 115,000 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
And a sizeable amount were teed up in the South Bay where outdoor recreation 
rates high on the lists of active residents. 
</P>
<P>
The hassle involved in getting playing time on a course, however, reminds some 
of another Southern California headache. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing here is just like being on the freeway," said Ed Ronderas, a starter 
at Los Verdes Golf Course in Rancho Palos Verdes. "When I send people out (onto 
the course), there are always others right behind. They start jamming up." 
</P>
<P>
Chimes in Eugene Hardy, the head pro at Carson's Victoria Golf Course: "It's 
like the freeway. It was designed for just so many people to use at once and 
there's just a certain amount of tee times available." 
</P>
<P>
The choice Thursday through Sunday slots that are up for grabs -- a packed day 
for a course is a foursome every seven minutes for 12 hours, or 432 golfers -- 
are gobbled up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
As with most courses, those in the South Bay have little traffic during the 
week, but then the weekend throngs arrive and most facilities are forced to 
send out flights of five players instead of the standard quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations are usually taken one week in advance, thereby prompting long 
morning lines for those signing up to play the following week. Most of those 
golfers spend the night at the course to assure their slots. 
</P>
<P>
"I've come here at 3:30 in the morning (to get in line), and I've seen wives, 
kids in pajamas and campers out in the parking lot," said Torrance golfer Ron 
Newman, who has made many midnight excursions to line up. 
</P>
<P>
A sheet is posted on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings at most of the 
courses. Golfers sign their names and have to stay overnight to retain their 
spot once the starter's window opens at 5 a.m. Some courses deploy patrols to 
ensure that people aren't signing their names and then going home to a snuggly 
bed until morning. 
</P>
<P>
"They have guys who have flashlights who go out there and check your license 
plate number, which you have to write down, and also check to see if you're in 
the car," said Bill Sparkman, a frequenter of a few parking lot slumber parties 
at Los Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Provine says some golfers trying to get tee times are "like 16-year-olds at a 
rock concert. I can put it in the same class. One guy even tried putting a 
dummy in his car so he didn't have to wait. I've seen guys try to bribe the 
starters for $100. Some of them will do anything (to ensure teeing off)." 
</P>
<P>
The overcrowding may come from the fact that there are so many golfers in the 
South Bay, which has only five public golfing facilities: 18-hole courses 
Victoria (in Carson), Alondra (Torrance), Los Verdes (Rancho Palos Verdes) and 
Westchester, and Wilmington's Harbor Golf Course, a nine-hole park. 
</P>
<P>
On most public courses, a large percentage of the players are either beginners 
or "whim" players. 
</P>
<P>
"I call 'em 'tank tops,' " said Hardy. "They're guys wearing shorts, tennis 
shoes and tank tops shirts. Some show up without clubs and without much 
knowledge of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Ronderas says many high school and college-age youths looking for leisure 
squeeze in for tee times quite often at Los Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Another source tapping into the golfing craze is L.A.'s huge Asian population. 
</P>
<P>
"Oriental people are fond of good golf courses," said Takahara Takahisa, who 
recently moved from Japan to Westwood. "We are mostly businessmen, and 
businessmen like to play golf. They need to play good golf in order to do 
better with their business, because there are lots of business deals made on 
the golf course." 
</P>
<P>
The game, says Long Beach golfer Gary Kanda, helps reveal what a potential 
business partner is made of. "We can find out the character of the person we're 
playing with. He might not be the kind of guy to make deals with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of golfing also makes it attractive to people from the Orient. Whereas 
a round of 18 holes in the U.S. costs about $10, golfers in Japan shell out 
$150-$200. A $4 bucket of range balls can run you $50 in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Says Kanda: "Playing here is like playing free, really, compared to Japan. It's 
a free luxury here." 
</P>
<P>
But that privilege is beginning to run aground in the South Bay because of a 
saturation of players. Some of the courses resemble mini free-for-alls, with 
little elbow room on the practice putting greens and driving ranges, as well as 
the fairways. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious answer would be for the city to build more courses, but land prices 
and red tape, says Provine, are obstacles nearly impossible to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Some people think the crowding can be sifted by making newer players aware of 
the nuances of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of golfers here, and 50% don't know golf etiquette. If they 
did, they could get through the courses a lot faster," said Ronderas, who has 
played in Europe where golfers get through a round about one hour quicker than 
their American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"They spend needless time here practice-putting, taking their time on swings 
and searching for balls and not letting groups play through." 
</P>
<P>
Says Mike Buroza, an assistant pro at Los Verdes: "Some of them take their time 
like it's the U.S. Open." 
</P>
<P>
But course managers surely don't mind the flow of money from the constant 
barrage of golfers for greens fees, cart and club rentals and food. Some of 
them revel in the city's billing as the national busybody of golfing. 
</P>
<P>
Says Bob Collins, a starter at Westchester Golf Course: "We are, with very 
little argument, the busiest golf course in the world." 
</P>
<P>
There are no official records, but with over 150,000 rounds played last year at 
Westchester, it is certainly among the country's five most-frequented courses. 
Harbor and Los Verdes are close behind, each having more than 130,000 players 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are outrageous numbers," said Leonard Jones, head pro at Cedar Crest 
Golf Course in golf-crazed Dallas. "Here there is a thirst for golfing, but 
we're not overly crowded and we very seldom turn people away." Cedar Crest, one 
of the busier courses in Dallas, averages about 80,000 rounds each year. 
</P>
<P>
Speedier play and a loosening of the weekend tee times will lighten the 
crowding. Those may be the best solutions, for golf is fast growing out of the 
fad stage for most sporting folks, and the fight to get on the course will 
probably never be short of willing participants.

FATHER AND SON TACKLE SUCCESS ON AND OFF THE FOOTBALL FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you want to do Eric Hansen a favor, don't mention that he is considered one 
of the best football players at North Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
And don't remind him that he was named MVP of the 48-team L.A. Games passing 
tournament last month. Flattery will get you nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to get away from that," he said. "I'd rather hear that I'm bad. Then I 
work to get better." 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, it's little wonder why Hansen and his father get along so 
well. Dan Hansen, the Saxons' offensive coordinator and a former standout 
quarterback at North, is his son's toughest critic. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't let him get a big head," said the elder Hansen. "He knows I'll put him 
in his place. I've always told him, 'If you're not going to go out and get 
better, then people will pass you up.' 
</P>
<P>
"Eric is different than a lot of kids. He knows he has to keep working and 
improving." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Hansen's competitive fires have been burning brightly this summer as he 
prepares for a senior season that he hopes will bring success on the field as 
well as off of it -- in the form of a college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-1, 165-pound wide receiver made a name for himself in June when he 
scored 13 touchdowns in six games to lead North to the championship of the 
prestigious L.A. Games tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has continued to work on his skills as a pass receiver and 
defensive back. His summer routine includes games in passing leagues and 
tournaments, and he spent last week at a football camp at Brigham Young 
University, where his father was an All-American defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen knows there is much work to be done if he wants to realize his full 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
"I always know there's somebody out there who can beat me," he said in a phone 
interview from Brigham Young. "That's why I'm out here. I know I still have a 
long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, who stayed with his grandparents during his week in Utah, would like to 
return to Brigham Young next year with a football scholarship. But he's not 
picky: "I will go anywhere I can get a scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Hansen said his son has received about 30 written inquiries from major 
colleges. He sees to it that Eric fills out and returns every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has a chance to be a college football player," said Brigham Young 
defensive coordinator Dick Felt, who coached Dan Hansen when he played for the 
Cougars in the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Eric is more confident about his chances of playing college football since his 
stellar performance in the L.A. Games. North, with only four starters from last 
season, wasn't considered a favorite among a talented field of teams that 
included L.A. City 4-A champion Carson, L.A. City 2-A runner-up Westchester and 
a potent outfit from Kennedy High in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But, with Hansen and quarterback Brian Jurado playing brilliantly, North won 
six games without a loss, culminated by victories over Westchester, 19-6, and 
Kennedy, 26-19, during the final day at El Camino College. Hansen scored five 
touchdowns in the two games, including the game-winner with four seconds left 
in the finals against Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
"He caught everything in sight," said North Coach Don Bohannon. "He was just 
tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
Like nearly everyone else, Hansen was surprised by the impressive showing of 
North's young team, which started more underclassmen than seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think we could win it," he said. "I was hoping we would do well, but 
I didn't think we'd get that far. I played my best, the best I've played in a 
long while." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his fine effort, the ever-modest Hansen insisted that Jurado should 
have been named MVP. However, tournament officials selected Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen earned most of his recognition on defense last season. He was chosen to 
the All-Ocean League first team as a cornerback. He didn't figure in North's 
offensive plans until midway through the season when his father replaced Stew 
Roper as offensive coordinator and the Saxons began to pass more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Eric labored in the shadow of receiver-defensive back Anthony Cole, an 
all-South Bay selection who graduated in June. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric had a good year but we had Anthony, who was doing everything for us," 
said Bohannon, whose team finished 7-4 and lost in the first round of the CIF 
playoffs. "Eric didn't get the ink that maybe he should have gotten. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, he's going to be one of our best players this year. He 
probably will be a marked man until we get some other things accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen realizes that North's success this summer, when games are conducted in a 
7-on-7 touch format and players do not wear pads or helmets, doesn't compare to 
the real thing on Friday nights in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pleased, but it doesn't make us any better," he said. "We still have a 
lot to prove." 
</P>
<P>
Under the experienced eye of his father, Hansen has played football since a 
young age. But his athletic interests aren't limited to the gridiron. He was 
named co-MVP of North's track team as a sprinter last spring and he plans to go 
out for basketball this season. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen also does well in the classroom, carrying a 3.2 grade-point average and 
serving on the student council. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan on having a full senior year," he said. "I wouldn't have it any other 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen credits his father for keeping him focused on his goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a real good relationship," he said. "On the field, we're not father 
and son any more, we're coach and player. I'm just another person. I try to 
play up to his standards. He expects a lot. I just have to do my part like 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Is Dan Hansen tougher on his son than other players? 
</P>
<P>
"At times, I think he is," Eric said. "But it's what I need. I can be lazy. 
It's a good kind of push. I don't resent it. 
</P>
<P>
"He points out mistakes and what I need to improve on. He just tells me what I 
already know. He congratulates me, too." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Dan Hansen is tough on his son because he knows others are going to be 
even tougher. In the competitive world of prep football, sometimes it takes 
more than good numbers to catch the eye of scouts and recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Lascola, director of the Southern California-based Scouting Evaluation 
Assn., has never heard of Eric Hansen and he doesn't put much stock in summer 
passing leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids look good in things like that," he said. "When they put the pads 
on and turn the lights on, that's when it counts. To make a pure judgment on a 
player, I like to see him in a game." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is exactly what Eric Hansen wants to hear.

BRAY FINDS IT'S EASIER SECOND TIME AROUND 
</P>

<P>
John Bray had done it before, so he figured he could do it again. 
</P>
<P>
He was right. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, while training for a U.S.-Soviet Union boxing series, Bray 
dropped Eugene Gill with a left hook and a quick right during a sparring match. 
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals of the 201-pound division at the U.S. Olympic Festival 
Saturday at Myriad Exhibit Hall, Bray got the same result. 
</P>
<P>
Only this time he used only one hand -- a straight right that sent Gill 
sprawling to the canvas 45 seconds into the second round and prompted referee 
Gene Reese to stop the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured that if I could drop him in the gym, I could drop him in the fight," 
said Bray, who trains in Van Nuys. "He figured he was going to get back at me . 
. . I guess the best man stood." 
</P>
<P>
Bray will meet Javier Alvarez of San Antonio, Tex., for the gold medal on 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, who defeated Bray by decision on his way to winning the U.S. amateur 
championship earlier this year, decisioned Rodney Price of Elizabeth, N.J., in 
the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
"I totally underestimated Alvarez in the nationals," Bray said. "I was favored 
to win and with that attitude I went in a little too big-headed and he 
surprised me . . . I only make a mistake once." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez's handlers seemingly expected to meet Gill in the final. As the Flint, 
Mich., native made his way to the ring, one shouted, "You'd better be there, 
Gill. We don't want no substitutes." 
</P>
<P>
Bray quickly made it apparent that they would get one. He decked Gill for the 
first time with a right to the head with less than a minute left in the first 
round and forced another standing-8 count with a furious combination shortly 
before the bell. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first round after I dropped him I said, 'This is it,' " Bray said. 
"He's a game fighter. Most guys would feel those right hands and just stay 
down, but he kept fighting." 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved Bray's record to 75-8 with 50 knockouts. He had been stuck 
at 49 knockouts since March. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to break that 50 mark," he said. "It was sitting on 49 too long." 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Don MacLean was one of five West players to score in double figures, but the 
South won in overtime, 98-94. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean, a former Simi Valley High standout who started at forward last season 
as a freshman for UCLA, made only two of six field-goal attempts, but was six 
of six from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Butler, a former standout at Oakwood School who will attend UCLA in 
the fall, scored nine points for the West. Adonis Jordan, a Kansas freshman out 
of Cleveland High, missed all three of his shooting attempts. 
</P>
<P>
CYCLING 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Cronkhite of Quartz Hill checked into the Festival Village early to scout 
the competition venues and it paid off. He won a gold medal in the men's 
20-kilometer time trial in 25:26.48 -- more than 10 seconds better than the 
second-place finisher. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the fastest time trial course that I have ever been on," he said. "It 
really helped me to come on Wednesday to relax and train. Most of the time we 
are hurried from event to event and don't have time to concentrate." 
</P>
<P>
Katie Beck of Simi Valley was eighth in the women's time trial in 30:11.31. 
</P>
<P>
FIGURE SKATING 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Carz of North Hollywood and partner Doug Williams of Playa del Rey are 
second in pairs skating after the completion of the original program. 
</P>
<P>
Tisha Walker of Thousand Oaks is in fifth place after the women's original 
program. Tamara Kuchiki of Canoga Park is in 12th place. The leader is Kristi 
Yamaguchi of Fremont, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
SLOW-PITCH SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Ron Whittleton of Sepulveda and infielder Manny Maldonado of North 
Hollywood played sparingly for the South as slow-pitch made its Festival debut. 
</P>
<P>
The East had 34 hits, including 12 home runs, in a 33-12 rout of the South. 
</P>
<P>
KAYAKING 
</P>
<P>
Susan Bragg of Newbury Park finished fifth in the women's 500-meter event with 
a time of 2:10.05. 
</P>
<P>
TEAM HANDBALL 
</P>
<P>
Three players from the Ventura Condors combined for 12 goals as the West 
defeated the North, 17-16. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Fercho of Camarillo scored five times for the West, while club teammates 
Mike Hurdle (four goals)and Jeff Fruin (three goals), both of Reseda, helped 
out.

STUDIO CITY BROTHERS GO ELBOW-TO-ELBOW JOCKEYING FOR POSITION AMONG NATION'S 
SPEED-SKATING ELITE

<TEXT>
<P>
Long before Bruce McNall whipped out his checkbook, picked a number and started 
etching zeroes next to it, the Kings already were among the nation's best on 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
No, no, no, not those Kings; certainly not. 
</P>
<P>
Why, the ones in Inglewood are merely Gretzky-come-latelies compared to 
brothers Keith and Charles of the Studio City Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Keith, 23, and Charles, 19, both ranked among the nation's top 10 speed 
skaters, are a success story for the ages. Or, at least for the age groups. 
</P>
<P>
And theirs is a tale with an unusual twist. 
</P>
<P>
They are captivated by the same sport, live in the same house and attend the 
same university. Were speed skating a team sport like ice hockey, they might be 
brothers in arms. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they are brothers in elbows. The Kings compete against each other. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always that way. For a while, the brothers were separated in 
competition by age. 
</P>
<P>
They have advanced well beyond that stage, however, and they now go 
head-to-head. Only on an occasional relay do the brothers get a chance to team 
up. 
</P>
<P>
And even on relays they are sometimes a family divided. 
</P>
<P>
In competition at the U.S. Olympic Festival, which is held at the State 
Fairgrounds Arena, the Kings will represent different regions -- neither of 
which is the West. 
</P>
<P>
This is not cruel or illogical, event coordinators insist. It is simply the 
USOC's selection process -- unofficially known as the eenie-meenie-minie-mo 
method -- dividing the entrants into four equal teams. 
</P>
<P>
All of which means that for the next two days, Keith of the South and Charles 
of the East are going to have a rather difficult time avoiding each other here 
in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are short-track racers, competing at distances of 500, 1,000 and 
1,500 meters over a 111-meter oval that is set up on an ice hockey surface. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently there are more than six participants on the ice at once, jockeying 
for position like siblings at snack time. 
</P>
<P>
Keith and Charles claim success in evading a confrontation, but allowances are 
made for what they refer to as "normal brother bickering." 
</P>
<P>
"We do that," Keith says, "just to make sure people know we're normal." 
</P>
<P>
Keith, who is scheduled to graduate from Northern Michigan University in 
December, was introduced to speed skating by his grandfather, George Willson. 
</P>
<P>
Willson was in his 50s when he first tried the sport, but soon found that speed 
skating transcended even a somewhat spacious generation gap. 
</P>
<P>
Keith, who had tried the more-typical California sport of baseball as a 
youngster, took to the ice immediately at the age of 8. Charles, who preferred 
to do his racing around a dirt track, took a bit longer to convert. 
</P>
<P>
Success came almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
At 9, Keith was already sending opponents into retirement. In his first year of 
competition he defeated an age-group flash named Charlie Finney each time they 
raced. Finally, Choo-Choo Charlie, as he was known to race fans, decided he'd 
had enough. His was a career derailed. 
</P>
<P>
By the time they reached their teens, the Kings were well on their way to 
combining for more state age-group championships than they could apparently 
keep track of. 
</P>
<P>
Resting in the lobby of their dorm Saturday at the Festival Village at the 
University of Oklahoma in Norman, the brothers estimated their title total at 
somewhere between eight and 10. 
</P>
<P>
"California state champion wasn't that big of a deal to me," Charles said. "I 
still didn't feel like I was very good because whenever I'd go back to national 
meets I'd get killed." 
</P>
<P>
That, however, is no longer a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Charles, a sophomore pre-med student, is ranked third in the nation. Keith, 
whose training time in the past year has been taxed as he prepares for law 
school, is ranked ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, who say they don't keep track of their record against each other, 
have attained their national standing using strikingly contrasting styles. 
</P>
<P>
Keith prefers to charge from the back of the pack when possible, while Charles 
would rather control the pace from the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the possibility exists that someday in the heat of an important race 
Keith might take a run at his front-running younger brother, forcing a 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Would Charles cut his brother off? 
</P>
<P>
There was silence for a moment in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Charles: "I'd be more inclined to stop someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Keith: "He couldn't stop me no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
Charles: "Well, really, when it comes right down to a sprint at the end you 
don't know who's who, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Keith: "That's because you're delirious." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, brotherly love. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite the possibilities, if a King has to lose, he would rather it be to 
another King. It's an attitude that the Kings of Studio City share. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure that if you're going to lose, you might as well lose to your 
brother," Keith said. "It's the other guys that you don't want to lose to." 
</P>

RIO MESA UPSETS WESTLAKE, 15-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Frazier drove in five runs, four on a grand slam in the third inning, to 
lift Rio Mesa over Westlake-Agoura, 15-7, in an American Legion District 16 
game Saturday at Rio Mesa High. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 5-0, after 2 1/2 innings, Rio Mesa erupted for seven runs in the 
third, four in the fourth and three in the fifth. Gordy Abellero, Steve Soliz, 
Dmitri Young, and John McMullen each doubled for Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Smith hit a home run and a single and scored three runs for Westlake 
(25-3-4). Teammate Bob Grandpre was three for three. Scott Lerner (4-1), who 
was relieved by Sean Howard in the sixth, was charged with the loss.

FRASER PUTS RETIREMENT PLANS ON HOLD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alan Fraser was ready to call it a career last March after the Cal State 
Northridge basketball team concluded its season. 
</P>
<P>
However, thanks to a long-distance call Northridge assistant Rusty Smith 
received from West Germany, Fraser, 21, is setting aside his retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser leaves next month for Munich where he will play for Sportbund Munich, a 
Division 3 professional club that competes against regional opponents 
throughout West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great opportunity to keep playing and see Europe," said Fraser, a 
6-foot-6, 225-pound forward who averaged 8.7 points and 5.3 rebounds a game as 
a senior at CSUN. "At the end of the season, I was feeling that my game was 
getting better and better. I have more confidence now than I ever have." 
</P>
<P>
Fraser's package with the West German team includes air fare, an apartment, use 
of a car and a monthly stipend to cover other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who played in West Germany for seven years after completing his 
eligibility at Montana State University, was contacted in May by an old friend 
who is coaching in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Alan fits the bill of what they were looking for," Smith said. "They wanted a 
big kid who can play inside and score. 
</P>
<P>
"He also has the right personality because you have to be flexible." 
</P>
<P>
Fraser said he eventually will complete the four courses he needs to earn a 
degree in broadcast communications. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, like his retirement plans, school has been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fired up, ready to go and playing every night," Fraser said. "I'm trying 
to get into regular preseason shape. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to get over there and get started."

NWOKOLO, STILL CHASING FIGHT LEGACY, TRIES TO GET ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
He came out of Africa three years ago with a flashy name, a flashy record and 
bright hopes. 
</P>
<P>
He was born Charles Nwokolo, the nephew of Dick Tiger, who rose from poverty to 
win fame and fortune as a boxer. Tiger was the son of a poor Nigerian chicken 
farmer who won the world middleweight and light heavyweight championships 
before dying at 42 of liver cancer in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Nwokolo decided to assume his uncle's legacy. And his name. 
</P>
<P>
He left Nigeria with a 14-0 record, 12 by knockout, and the welterweight 
championship of Africa, and settled in Hollywood as Young Dick Tiger. 
</P>
<P>
But in the ensuing years, he hasn't quite lived up to the professional 
standards of old Dick Tiger. Nwokolo is just 12-8 with five knockouts since 
coming to America. His past two fights have been title shots and he has lost 
both. 
</P>
<P>
In May, he dropped a 12-round decision in London to Glenwood Brown in a 
Continental Americas welterweight championship fight. In June, Nwokolo fought 
for the United States Boxing Assn. junior middleweight title but lost a 
12-round decision to Art Serwano in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Some fighters, having failed in two title fights in two months, might take time 
off to rethink their game plan, reassess their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Not Nwokolo. 
</P>
<P>
He went right back to the gym and, on Tuesday, will be right back in the ring 
for the 10-round main event at The Country Club in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent will be junior middleweight Ruben Villaman (26-13-1, 23 knockouts) 
of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday's card will be middleweights Ray McElroy (5-0, four knockouts) 
of Long Beach and Robert Carson (6-2-2, three knockouts) of Hawthorne in an 
eight-rounder, and welterweights Stuart Baynes (9-10, five knockouts) of 
Pasadena and Carlton Brooks (10-6-2, three knockouts) of Los Angeles in another 
eight-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
The card begins at 7:30 p.m.

PICO RIVERA ACTS TO PUT PARK UNDER PRIVATE MANAGEMENT

<P>
Caught in a budget crunch, city officials are proposing to turn over control of 
a public park and equestrian center to its manager because of the park's track 
record of financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Without asking for public bids, the city is negotiating with James Gandara, who 
has been manager of Bicentennial Park and its 168 horse stalls for 11 years. 
Under the plan he would quit his $44,000-a-year city job to become the private 
operator of the park complex. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which could be approved by Sept. 1, has come under sharp attack 
by horse owners who claim Gandara would be forced to cut staff and general care 
in an effort to streamline the 11-year-old operation. The horse owners also are 
criticizing the city for not allowing others to bid for the control of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move Seen as Easing Budget 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Dennis Courtemarche said he has recommended shifting control of 
the park to private management as a way to ease ongoing budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
He also has suggested that all department heads trim programs and services to 
balance the $22.5-million budget for fiscal year 1989-90. The budget is 
expected to be passed Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting tougher and tougher to make ends meet," Courtemarche said. "Each 
year we spend more money than we're taking. What we need to do is focus in on 
how to cut costs." 
</P>
<P>
Courtemarche has made across-the-board budget trims the centerpiece of the 
proposal he presented to the City Council recently. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the council, Courtemarche said spending in recent years has 
outpaced revenue, and city reserves have been threatened. 
</P>
<P>
"We must live within our revenue structure or we may have to drastically cut 
our day-to-day operations," he wrote in the June 29 letter. "We have chosen to 
deal with the issue now." 
</P>
<P>
And by allowing a private manager to operate the campground and stable, the 
city will have more control over its budget, Courtemarche said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had tremendous fluctuations," Courtemarche said, adding that the city 
unexpectedly had to boost the stable's budget by $80,000 last year. "(Now) we 
can predict how much money we can get, and don't have to worry about coming up 
with additional funds." 
</P>
<P>
Courtemarche estimates that the city will save up to $500,000 by hiring private 
managers to run the park and the Pico Rivera Golf Course, near the Whittier 
Narrows Dam. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are asking for bids from private management teams to run the 
golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Courtemarche defended the proposal to hire Gandara without opening the job to 
public bidding because, unlike the golf course, qualified managers would be 
hard to find, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gandara operated the facility at $80,000 beyond budget projections 
last fiscal year, Courtemarche believes the longtime stable manager could turn 
the operation around. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a known quantity," Courtemarche said. "He has knowledge of the 
facility and we won't miss a beat when we go to the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
A group of disgruntled horse owners, however, disagree that Gandara could make 
the park profitable without either raising stall fees or laying off employees 
and cutting back on services and the quality of horse food. 
</P>
<P>
Owners pay between $175 and $225 monthly for food and board for each horse. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that (Gandara) wants to make money," said Carol Palmer, who 
boards five thoroughbreds at the small city-owned stable along of the San 
Gabriel River. In fact, she said, "He wants to make a killing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contract 'Is the Pits' 
</P>
<P>
"I know he's going to cut corners," said one horse owner who asked not to be 
identified for fear of losing stall space. "(The proposed contract) is the 
pits." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Gandara said that the equestrian center and 
campground have been fiscally unstable for the past four years. He said that 
under a private agreement, he would have the power to make the operation 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"If I am awarded the contract," he said, "We will keep a very close eye on 
expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
Gandara denied charges that animal care will suffer under his private 
management. He said nothing will change immediately if the contract is approved 
in September. But he hinted that changes may take place in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I am guaranteeing the same quality of service and management and feed," he 
said, "contingent on the financial feasibility." He declined to elaborate when 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security Guard Concerned 
</P>
<P>
Some employees already fear a layoff is imminent under Gandara's contract, said 
Andy Acuna, a park ranger and night security guard at the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"He is just leading people on," Acuna said. He also said that employees who 
stayed with Gandara would not receive benefit packages to replace the city 
benefits that they have now. The city provides the stable's 12 full-time 
employees with full benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Courtemarche expressed confidence that the quality of the center under 
Gandara's leadership would not deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
"(Gandara) could run it more efficiently than we could," Courtemarche said. 
</P>
<P>
Courtemarche said he and Gandara are negotiating the terms on a two-year 
contract, which is expected to be voted on by the council in September. 
Courtemarche said that under the tentative agreement, Gandara would operate the 
stable rent free for the first year as long as he made at least $24,000 in 
improvements to the stable and campground. 
</P>
<P>
The second year, Gandara would pay $2,000 in monthly rent, Courtemarche said. 
The contract will be renegotiated at the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, the city plans to hire contractors for other 
departments and services, from tree trimming to janitorial services, 
Courtemarche said. He said this could save the city another $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time city officials have cut spending by turning public 
facilities over to private contractors. In 1980, the city turned over 
management of the Pico Rivera Sports Arena, next to the equestrian center, to a 
private management team.

RECORDS REVEAL CAMPBELL FORUM PAID WIFE'S FIRM 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 1988 women's conference sponsored by state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda 
Heights) paid $200,000 to a consulting firm owned by Campbell's wife and one of 
his former aides, state records filed last week show. 
</P>
<P>
The amount paid to the firm, West Coast Seminars of Laguna Niguel, accounted 
for more than 40% of the $486,000 in expenses incurred by the three-day 
conference held at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers on April 2 and 4 last year, 
according to records filed Wednesday with the state's Registry of Charitable 
Trusts. 
</P>
<P>
The filings are the latest disclosure about Campbell's controversial, nonprofit 
conferences, which have drawn the ire of feminists and attracted the interest 
of state investigators. Campbell also represents Whittier, La Mirada and La 
Habra Heights in the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office is investigating the propriety of fees paid 
to the consulting firm, which Orange County records show was formed by 
Campbell's wife, Margene, and Karen L. Smith, then an aide to the senator, in 
early 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commission Checking Statements 
</P>
<P>
And the state's Fair Political Practices Commission has also opened its own 
review to see if the payments to the consulting firm -- as well as to one of 
Campbell's secretaries and his chief aide, Jerry Haleva -- were all properly 
recorded on annual economic interest statements. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the federal Small Business Administration has asked Campbell to 
repay $49,300 that it spent on the 1988 gathering. The agency wants the money 
back because it contends that Campbell violated an oral agreement on the fee 
that he was to pay Smith as coordinator of the event, according to a recently 
released report by the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
Although the repayment request was made in January, Campbell had not refunded 
the money by May 9, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Graham, a Democrat who ran against Campbell unsuccessfully in 1988, said 
Wednesday's filings indicate once again that the Hacienda Heights Republican 
used the conferences to "line his own pockets. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"What appalls me is that this man who is supposed to be representing the people 
and women can take this money and walk away with it," Graham charged. "It blows 
my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell failed to return telephone calls on Wednesday and his wife couldn't be 
reached for comment. An employee at Campbell's El Toro district office said 
Wednesday that Smith quit the senator's staff in May. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper articles last year prompted the investigations by revealing the 
payments to Campbell's wife and staff members from previous women's conferences 
-- annual affairs that began in 1984 to offer tips on careers, personal 
development and "life enrichment." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, such female luminaries as Jihan Sadat, the former first lady of 
Egypt, and talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey have addressed the gatherings. Last 
year, U.S. Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin gave a luncheon address about the 
child-care problems of working women. 
</P>
<P>
A program for the 1988 conference also lists Campbell's wife as a "community 
leader" who took charge of a seminar entitled "Secrets of a Successful 
Marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state records have shown that the conferences were lucrative for 
Margene Campbell and others close to Campbell. One of the prime financial 
beneficiaries has been Smith, formerly the senator's Orange County field 
coordinator, who earned a total of $61,500 for individual work on the 
conferences between 1984 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fee to Arrange Conference 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, county records show, Smith formed a consulting firm with Campbell's 
wife four days before the 1987 conference. The firm was paid a fee of $165,000 
to arrange the conference -- an amount that totaled nearly 30% of the expenses 
for the event, state records show. 
</P>
<P>
Filings on Wednesday show that the consulting firm did even better the next 
year, taking in $200,000 for the April, 1988 event. If Margene Campbell is 
half-owner of the consulting firm, that would mean that the senator's 
community-property share of the payments would be $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's filings also show that the 1988 event paid out $40,947 in salaries, 
but the documents do not identify who received the money. The paper work shows 
that while the 1988 conference received $455,684 in revenue -- most of it 
coming from corporate sponsors and attendance fees -- it still ended with a 
$27,315 deficit, which was made up by more than $50,000 in surplus carried over 
from previous conferences. 
</P>
<P>
The other major expense listed by the filings is $142,798 paid to the Anaheim 
Hilton to rent conference rooms in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
A Hilton employee said that the bill was sent to Campbell's El Toro office on 
Lake Center Drive, the same address that is given for the nonprofit group on 
Wednesday's filing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sponsorship Dropped 
</P>
<P>
The employee also said that Smith is arranging another women's conference for 
the Anaheim Marriott this year, but the event will not be connected with 
Campbell, who has reportedly dropped his sponsorship in the wake of the 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the nonprofit women's conference had sought to delay the filing 
of the organization's 1988 report until Oct. 15, but the state attorney 
general's office turned down that request on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter denying the request, Deputy Atty. Gen. Yeoryios C. Apallas cited 
the department's audit of the organization and said the 1988 figures were 
needed "to enable us to make a determination as to the reasonableness and 
appropriateness of certain consultant fees paid to disqualified persons."

REVISED STATE RULES BAR COUNCIL VOTE IN SIGNAL HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SIGNAL HILL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This city of 8,000 inhabitants has no movie theater or major chain supermarket. 
There is only one major department store. But there are sensational views and 
brushy hillsides ripe for housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
In the most literal sense, this is a small city. A 2-square-mile city 
surrounded by Long Beach, "The Hill" is a place where just about every property 
owner has a vested interest in civic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
And therein lies the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission revised its regulations last year 
to require that public officials automatically disqualify themselves from 
voting on any project within 300 feet of any real estate they own, including 
their homes, because it could present a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voting Power Annuled 
</P>
<P>
City officials recently discovered that the revised regulations, when applied 
to Signal Hill, wipe out the voting power of a majority of the five City 
Council members and Planning Commission members on issues related to the most 
important developments in the city -- luxury hillside housing that could 
increase the city's population by 25%. Three members of each panel live within 
300 feet of the proposed projects. 
</P>
<P>
Two other planning commissioners and a council member reside within 2,500 feet, 
the zone in which public officials are barred from voting if they believe a 
project would increase their property values or business revenues by $10,000 or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
In Signal Hill's case, the 2,500-foot distance from the proposed luxury 
developments boundary includes all but the northwest corner of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What value is there to being on the City Council if I can't sit here with a 
vote and represent the people?" asked an exasperated Mayor Gerard Goedhart last 
week as the City Council fumed over the ruling. Goedhart and council members 
Louis Dare and Sara Ann Hanlon are directly affected, along with planning 
commissioners Michael Noll, Jack McManus and Alan Ross. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. David Aleshire said he sought the commission opinion after public 
officials were asked to vote on developments near their homes. He said the 
ruling could affect other small cities as well. "It's really a problem trying 
to apply these rules," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to put together a quorum for a vote on an issue is for the 
disqualified members to draw lots among themselves. The winner would be allowed 
to vote every time that issue arose, but only to break a tie vote. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that means decisions on some issues have to be delayed when one of 
the city's two eligible voting council members is absent, as was the case last 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
One agenda item involved what normally might be a more mundane function of 
civic government: the realignment of a street. But because 20th Street was 
being altered so that it will better serve the new developments on the hill, 
City Atty. Aleshire said the conflict-of-interest regulations applied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quick Action Needed 
</P>
<P>
One of the two qualified voters, Councilman Richard Ceccia, was absent. The 
matter had to be held until next Tuesday despite the developer's pleas that the 
project's success hinged on quick action. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a frustrating situation for all of us," Goedhart said as the council 
prepared to move on to the next item. "Maybe we should invite the FPPC (to the 
next meeting so) they could see us in action." The quip drew polite laughter. 
</P>
<P>
The council already has taken the first step toward fighting the regulations. 
The members sent a letter to state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) 
asking for legislation that would exempt small cities such as Signal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"While the FPPC is trying to stop conflict of interest and rightly so, there 
are special situations that need to be addressed. When there is a very large 
percentage of the community affected, it needed to be represented by the full 
council," the letter states. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revised Last Year 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Michioku, spokeswoman for the commission in Sacramento, said the 
conflict-of-interest regulations were revised last year to clear up 
misunderstandings among elected officials, who thought they were too vague. 
</P>
<P>
While the commission's response to the Signal Hill inquiry was considered 
merely an opinion, the commission has full authority to enforce its 
regulations, Michioku said. 
</P>
<P>
She noted, however, that public officials are allowed to vote in situations 
where they believe the benefits of a project would accrue equally to all 
residents.

A PROBLEM PRESERVED; 
</P>
<P>
RANCHO PROPOSAL WOULD TRADE OLD PLASTER FOR OLDER ADOBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The courtyard at Rancho Los Cerritos in Long Beach is a pleasant place to while 
away a summer afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Covered by neatly trimmed grass, the 120-by-60-foot yard contains palm trees, 
orange trees and a bird of paradise plant. Near its center, a quiet reflecting 
pond plays host to a family of goldfish. And leading to a large glassed sun 
patio at one end, the seemingly endless white plastered walls bespeak the 
casual elegance of a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
Within those walls, however, lurks a potential danger that could result in the 
radical alteration of everything familiar the courtyard holds. 
</P>
<P>
The culprit is moisture. Unable to escape through the plastered cement that 
coats the facility's original adobe walls, engineers say, water is literally 
being sucked up from the ground into the interior wall, causing severe 
deterioration that has already resulted in visible cracks and major crumbling. 
Unless something is done, the engineers say, the ranch house -- built in 1844 
and designated as a national, state and local historical landmark -- may become 
a structural hazard. 
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, employees of the city, which has owned and administered 
the site since 1956, have devised a drastic plan. Remove the exterior plaster 
cement so that the adobe can breathe, they say. And, in the process, make 
dramatic structural changes that would return the rancho to its original 
historical condition circa 1870 when it was a thriving sheep ranch with 
primitive dirt floors and flat tar roofs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Type of Construction 
</P>
<P>
The changes also would greatly enhance the rancho's educational value and 
visitor appeal, they argue. Because the project would rely on earlier, simpler 
forms of construction, they say, it would cost less than preserving the site as 
it now exists. 
</P>
<P>
But it would also virtually undo a major 1931 renovation performed by the Bixby 
family, the site's former owners whose history is inexorably tied to that of 
the city and the rancho. That renovation preserved the facility for posterity, 
transforming Rancho Los Cerritos from a dilapidated ranch house to the elegant 
1930s mission revival style of home that visitors now see. And the specter of 
reversing it has raised eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's appropriate," said Llewellyn Bixby, 81, who remembers 
living in the house as a young man during the period that his father -- also 
named Llewellyn -- performed the needed alterations. "Dad would probably be 
very disturbed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Louis Skelton, a local architect and member of the city's Cultural 
Heritage Commission, which earlier this month heard an informal presentation on 
the plan: "I have (serious) reservations about removing something that has been 
here for more than 50 years and has become a recognized part of the community. 
Based on what I know right now, I would be reluctant to vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
The deep feelings for the rancho stem from its history. 
</P>
<P>
Located in the Bixby Knolls area of Long Beach, the 4.7-acre site was 
originally part of a 300,000-acre land grant awarded by the Spanish government 
to Manuel Nieto in the late 1700s as a reward for his military service. After 
years of joint ownership by his children, the lands were eventually divided 
into six parcels, one of which was Rancho Los Cerritos bordered on the west by 
what is now the Los Angeles River and on the south by the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
In 1843 a Massachusetts-born businessman named John Temple purchased the site 
and the next year constructed the present adobe house as headquarters for his 
large-scale cattle operations. By 1866, however, successive years of drought 
and flood had put a severe dent in the cattle business, prompting Temple to 
sell the ranch to a firm called Flint, Bixby &amp; Co. which was in the 
business of raising sheep. 
</P>
<P>
That company sent Jotham Bixby, the brother of one of its founders, to manage 
the new ranch. Eventually the young manager bought into the property, formed 
his own company, and from 1866 to 1881 resided with his wife and seven children 
in the old Temple adobe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Portions Were Sold 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1870s, with the sheep industry declining, Bixby began leasing or 
selling off portions of the estate. Four thousand acres in the southwest corner 
were purchased by William Willmore in 1881. Willmore lost his option on the 
acreage and was forced to give up his contract in 1884 to the Long Beach Land 
and Water Co., which renamed the area Long Beach. Downtown Long Beach now 
occupies the acreage. 
</P>
<P>
Other parcels evolved into the cities of Downey, Paramount and Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
The adobe itself fell into disrepair for many years after Jotham Bixby's 
departure. Then in 1929 his nephew, Llewellyn Bixby, purchased the property and 
began the extensive renovations that included the plaster cement coating, a new 
red-tiled roof, expanded rooms, electricity, plumbing, fireplaces, the sun 
porch, new floors and much of the landscaping. After living in the house until 
the late 1940s, the Bixby family sold it to the city, which turned it into a 
museum dedicated to educating the public regarding the ranching period of 
pre-Long Beach history. 
</P>
<P>
That mission could be better served, according to Ellen Calomiris, who manages 
the site for the city, by returning the old ranch house to its 1870s design. 
"We're misleading the public," she said, referring to the estimated 15,000 
visitors -- including about 3,000 elementary school pupils -- who tour the site 
each year. "What we can tell with (the house) now is the life of a well-to-do 
family in the 1930s with its maids and chauffeurs. What we want to tell is the 
story of economic and domestic life in the 1870s." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transition Period 
</P>
<P>
That period is of particular significance in California history, she said, 
because it represents the transition from early ranch life to the creation of 
cities and towns. And while the region is rife with other good examples of 
1930s-style mission revival architecture, she said, the proposed renovation 
would result in the only restored 1870s ranch house in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the appeal would be much broader," Calomiris said. "Although the 
Bixby family has always had a major role in the development of the city, this 
house didn't (after the late 1800s)." 
</P>
<P>
But the city's approach has raised the hackles of some historic 
preservationists who are bothered by the philosophical implications of focusing 
on one particular period of a building's history to the physical detriment of 
all its other periods. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Calomiris earlier this month, in fact, David W. Look, chief of 
the Preservation Assistance Branch of the U.S. Department of the Interior which 
has given Rancho Los Cerritos national historic landmark status, expressed the 
department's staunch opposition to the proposed changes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Removal of 1931 Changes 
</P>
<P>
"We understand that your purpose is to interpret the 1860s-1880s period of the 
rancho," Look wrote, "and that the current 1930s appearance of the building and 
grounds makes interpretation of the earlier period difficult. However, the 
proposed restoration would result in the removal of all of the 1931 changes to 
the property, which are now historic and appear to have gained significance in 
their own right." 
</P>
<P>
Removal of the 1931 alterations, Look went on, would violate several Department 
of Interior standards which "encourage recognition and respect for changes that 
have taken place over time, and discourage the removal or alteration of 
historic fabric." 
</P>
<P>
Besides removal of the cement plaster now coating the adobe, the proposal calls 
for replacing the red tiled roof with a flat tar roof in some places and a 
pitched shingle roof in others; removing much of the interior cement and wood 
floors in favor of packed dirt floors; getting rid of the glassed-in patio and 
reflecting pond; and replacing the grass and most of the landscaping in the 
courtyard with coarse sand. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the project would convert existing rooms back to their original 
uses and add at least six interior walls that were removed in 1931. Those 
familiar with the proposal estimate its cost at about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interior Strengthening 
</P>
<P>
Even if the proposal is eventually rejected, engineers say, the structure at a 
minimum would have to be preserved by replacing the cement coating with sand 
plaster, removing the cement work and brick pathways adjacent to exterior adobe 
walls, removing the concrete slabs under the building's flooring, and 
installing an underground drainage system. The building's roof would also have 
to be removed so that existing beams could be strengthened and interior cross 
walls reconstructed to meet local earthquake standards, the experts say. This 
rehabilitation would cost even more than the proposal to convert the rancho to 
its original status, they say. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they expect the matter to come before the Cultural Heritage 
Commission for a formal vote in October. Following that, they say, it would 
have to be approved by the city's Planning Commission and, finally, the full 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"We're (moving) very cautiously," said Ruthann Lehrer, the city's historic 
preservation officer, adding that her own mind is not yet made up on the 
matter. "Los Cerritos is a very important site with a unique place in the 
history of Long Beach. We want to be very wise and careful because (what we 
decide) will set the stage for the future of the site, which we hope will go on 
for many hundreds of years."

SHE WRITES WHAT SHE KNOWS -- LOSING AT LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>

Leslie Caveny rummages around in her purse and pulls out a large pink clock on 
a rope. "It's my biological clock," she says blithely, hanging it around her 
neck. "Of course, most people's biological clock is about getting married and 
having babies. This is just about having someone to sleep with. So maybe it's a 
hormonal love-life clock. Someday, somewhere, somebody will want to be with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
It is -- and isn't -- as tragic as it sounds. In her "Love of a Pig" (through 
Aug. 13 at Studio City's Theatre West), Caveny, 27, traverses the rocky 
wasteland of singlehood and one-sided love in a way that is at once comical, 
sad, terrifying, mortifying and exhilarating. It is also achingly real. Working 
with a quick-change chorus of cohorts, Caveny plays Jenny, an engaging 
violinist who is head-over-heels for Joe, a churlish, self-involved bass 
player. 
</P>
<P>
Ostensibly a piece of fiction, the writer's own love life is the obvious -- and 
unabashed -- source. "How pathetic have I been?" says Caveny, giggling. "Very 
pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The titular reference, she says, denotes "a guy who does not treat you well, 
and you take it. He may not treat you any way at all, and still you want him. I 
know a lot of women like that -- and a lot of men. So it's not a man-hate 
thing. I spent a lot of years blaming men. Finally, I realized if I blame them, 
I don't have any control. But if I take some of the responsibility, I can 
control it, I can change it. I can change what I'm willing to put up with." 
</P>
<P>
That includes societal pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been accused of being an Amazon. I've felt guilty too, like, 'Oh, I'm not 
feminine enough; my body's not a certain way.' I think I'm past that now. I'm 
liking myself more in that way." And yet she says firmly, "I'm not someone 
who's dying to be married. I mean, in the least few years, I've been asked out 
on more dates. So I'm not panicked in the sense that nobody's showing any signs 
of interest at all. It's just that so far, all my relationships have been 
unhealthy." 
</P>
<P>
How unhealthy? 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt I was very strong, independent, capable, happy," she says wryly. 
"But in relationships, I'd become nothing. My longest relationship was 11 
months; the average is six months. There've also been times I couldn't get a 
date to save my life. I once went a year and a half without a hug, kiss, 
anything. Then I'd meet someone who'd want to be taken care of. So I'd get in 
there, try to fix their lives; they'd need me and want to be with me all the 
time -- and I'd think that was love. But it was never about me." 
</P>
<P>
The love match in this play is one of those lopsided scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
"It's based on a particular man who I was obsessed with," Caveny says, nodding. 
"I chose to pretend the relationship was something completely different. If he 
just looked at me, I'd think, 'Yes, he loves me!' " For months, she nursed her 
crush from afar, as friends egged her on, persuading her that his passivity was 
not disinterest but shyness. Then one night, out of the blue, he made his move. 
She was wary but succumbed. The next morning he didn't speak to her. ("Major 
pig.") 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in New Jersey and Alabama, Caveny recalls writing poems and stories 
from childhood on. At 15, she developed a bad case of acne and persuaded her 
parents to let her transfer to a boarding school. "High school was very hard 
and very cruel," she says soberly. "Being made fun of and teased. Looking back, 
I realize they probably didn't say as many things as I thought. But I was so 
self-conscious. And I felt so hideous." 
</P>
<P>
At Boston University, Caveny studied playwrighting with Derek Walcott but got a 
bachelor of fine arts in theater performance. "I always wanted to be a writer," 
she explains, "but I decided I couldn't try to do both. So writing went on the 
back burner. But I always took creative writing classes, and did some short 
stories." She pauses. "I believe in my acting abilities 100%, and I love 
performing. But there's a separate pride I have about writing. It just feels 
more . . . important." 
</P>
<P>
A move to New York after college was short-lived: "I spent my time auditioning, 
trying to pay the rent and running from scary people. A guy put a knife to my 
throat in the subway. That had been my biggest fear -- and now it was coming 
true. I thought, 'I'm going to die like this? This is ridiculous.' 
</P>
<P>
Since arriving here in 1985, Caveny has become a member of Theatre West's 
acting and writing workshops, and also ventured into doing stand-up comedy 
around town. In the stand-up work, she says, "I do one character predominantly, 
kind of an alter-ego. But it works out very nicely. 'Babs' can be as pathetic 
as she wants -- and nobody ever thinks it's me." 
</P>
<P>
Displaying her private pain publicly, Caveny says, has never fazed her. "I 
guess I don't worry about peddling my guts on stage," she says with a shrug. "I 
worry about physical danger. I don't want to pretend that people can't hurt my 
feelings. Of course they can. But when we did this for the Theatre West Fest, 
so many people came up to me and told me how they related to it, it blew my 
mind. They all knew Joe. The funny thing is, none of the men ever think they're 
Joe."

MUSIC NOTEBOOK: AFTER A DECADE, RECORD DEAL NUDGES VENICE BEYOND THE CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a decade, Venice labored as just another Los Angeles rock 'n' roll group 
with a good following but no opportunity to move beyond the local club scene. 
</P>
<P>
Now they have a chance to take their music to the next level. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Venice entered the studio to record its first album for 
Modern/Atlantic Records. The band, a socially conscious group heavily 
influenced by the R&amp;B sound of the early 1970s, should spend about two 
months recording 12 songs. 
</P>
<P>
Modern, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records, is expected to spend $190,000 on the 
album due out in late autumn. A video is likely, too, according to band 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Although the three-record deal represents an important career leap, lead 
singer-songwriter Kipp Lennon isn't celebrating prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't have a big party," Lennon said. "Now we have to make a great album, 
and then we have to make a great video, and then hope you are not a one-hit 
video." 
</P>
<P>
For the last two years, the band has sold out concerts at venues such as At My 
Place (213 seats), the Music Machine (425) and the Roxy (450). Two weeks ago, 
several hundred people attended a show at the Music Machine, which featured new 
material along with crowd-pleasing favorites such as "Ball and Chain," a song 
about racism, and "Pushed Her Too Far," which is about relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Lennon, who writes many of the songs, said the band received other offers for 
record deals but signed with Modern because "they liked us for all the right 
reasons. They weren't going to take us and try to turn us into some other band 
that we're not." 
</P>
<P>
He said there was no dramatic event that finally moved the band from a 
promising club group to the studio. "We just played as often as possible, and 
enough people saw us." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Littell has attracted a good following of his own. Since early June, 
Littell, along with his band, What is Said, has performed each Thursday night 
at Cafe Largo in the Fairfax District. The end of his special engagement will 
be July 27. 
</P>
<P>
Littell, who presents a mixture of offbeat poetry, jazz and African rhythms 
into what he calls "cabarock," pokes fun at himself and life around him. His 
show fits the cabaret atmosphere at the cafe, operated by Jean-Pierre Boccara, 
who still runs Lhasaland in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"In a world of copycats and clones, Littell stands out," said Richard Bruland, 
owner of Bebop Records and Fine Art in Reseda. "It's not rock 'n' roll; it's an 
artist who makes you walk away feeling he revealed something very personal." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Littell has appeared in plays at Will Geer's Theatricum Botanicum, LaMama 
Hollywood, Powerhouse Theater and Court Theater, and has done performance art 
pieces in smaller venues. These days, he is busy writing a musical. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran singer John Raitt will be the special guest soloist with the Santa 
Monica College Band, Orchestra and Choir when they perform "An Evening of Pops" 
at 8 p.m. July 29. 
</P>
<P>
The free concert, to be held in the Santa Monica College Amphitheater, is the 
third in the school's outdoor series, "Grand Summer Nights." 
</P>
<P>
Raitt, father of singer Bonnie Raitt, has performed in such shows as 
"Oklahoma," "Carousel" and "Annie Get Your Gun," and appeared in MGM 
productions of "Flight Command" and "Ziegfeld Girl." 
</P>
<P>
At present he is touring the country with "South Pacific."

MALIBU PIER: NEW START FOR AN 'ORPHAN'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For being one of the leading attractions in a town filled with famous sights, 
the Malibu pier has never received star treatment. 
</P>
<P>
It is mired in a sorry state of disrepair, under siege from an angry former 
landlord and suffering from absentee ownership, daily battering from the sea 
and 86 years of constant use. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there remains a steady stream of people angling to control it and make 
money from it, each offering promises to remodel it into a top-flight tourist 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Concession Manager 
</P>
<P>
Sometime in the next two weeks, the state Department of Parks and Recreation is 
expected to announce who will be the new concession manager for the dilapidated 
structure. The state has been looking for a new operator for months, trying to 
fill the gap created by the former landlord, who abruptly walked away from a 
20-year lease last year and then sued the state for more than $20 million in 
damages, alleging breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement will end a turbulent year in the life of the pier, which the 
state estimates is visited by more than 500,000 people from around the world 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1988, the state turned the concession contract over to West Los 
Angeles lawyer Joel Ladin, who promptly announced that he was going to raise 
the rents of the pier's two mainstays, Alice's Restaurant and Malibu Sport 
Fishing, by up to 500%. 
</P>
<P>
Ladin said he was just following good business practices, but Bob Yuro, 
co-owner of Alice's, responded by saying he was going to move the restaurant to 
Pacific Palisades. Ted Mills, manager of the sportfishing enterprise, announced 
that he was closing up the shop, which he did with plenty of fanfare and a huge 
round of drinks. 
</P>
<P>
But by November, Ladin found himself floundering, unable to attract new 
businesses to the pier, and he walked away from the concession contract amid a 
flurry of accusations. 
</P>
<P>
State parks officials, who have been looking for a concessionaire ever since, 
said they were stunned when Ladin sued them in April, charging fraud and 
misrepresentation, and alleging that the pier is unsafe and should be closed to 
the public. Ladin claims the cost of the pier's substructure repairs were 
estimated by the state at $400,000, but says in his lawsuit that they will 
actually cost $3.5 to $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Misunderstood Contract 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Vellanoweth, chief of the Concession Program Division of the state 
parks department, said that Ladin misunderstood the contract. Vellanoweth said 
that the $400,000 repair was for just one end of the structure and the actual 
cost of pier restoration was estimated at at least $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I think his lawsuit is frivolous," Vellanoweth said. "Joel got in over his 
head when he went to Malibu and he didn't understand all of the requirements 
needed to make a viable concession there. I think he just filed the lawsuit to 
make sure that his position was well known in the community as to why he got 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Ladin and his attorney declined to discuss the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Yuro and his partner, Peter Palazzo, who are still operating the 
popular pier restaurant, are one of three bidders for the concession contract. 
Glen Gerson, owner of the Calamigos Ranch restaurant in Malibu, is another. The 
third bidder remains unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Asked to Pay 
</P>
<P>
The Malibu Chamber of Commerce recently sent a letter to Vellanoweth asking 
that the state pay for the pier's restoration. "It is understood that the 
safety of the public must be guaranteed insofar as possible by bringing the 
structure up to standards, but it would seem this can be fairly done by the 
owner -- the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
Several business owners also have expressed concerns that by the time the 
details of a new concession contract can be worked out, a Pacific storm could 
wipe out the pier. They said that the state should make the repairs before 
turning over the lease and then get reimbursed for the work by the new 
concession operator. The state bought the pier from Malibu resident William 
Huber in 1980 and the structure has been closed periodically since then, 
because of heavy storm damage. 
</P>
<P>
However, Vellanoweth said that because of the "financial climate" of the state, 
it would be impossible to find the funds for the rehabilitation. Besides, he 
said, whoever wins the concession contract will easily make enough money in the 
next 20 years to pay for the structure repairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Concerned 
</P>
<P>
Yuro said he was not concerned that the pier was in any imminent danger and 
said he was willing to spend up to $5 million for the pier's restoration if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to establish it as Malibu's central landmark," he said. "We would 
really like to see it become the hub of Malibu, and I think if we can do the 
work in stages, then we can pull it off. This is a tremendous resource and it's 
too bad that it's been largely ignored over the years."

REFLECTIONS: 'THE GREATEST THING THE CIRCUS TAUGHT ME IS TO BE OPEN-MINDED 
ABOUT PEOPLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

While growing up, Janice Thatcher never even dreamed of traveling, let alone 
running away with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. From a 
low-income family near Imperial Beach, she was painfully shy and was a 
certified "wallflower" in high school. Now a circus veteran at 25, Thatcher has 
danced before celebrities, attended parties thrown by millionaires and visited 
most of the 48 states, as well as Japan and the Caribbean. She recently 
returned home to San Diego, where she is studying early childhood education at 
Southwestern College and working the lunch shift at the Tudor Too sandwich shop 
downtown. Lisa Reynolds interviewed her, and David McNew photographed her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Isaw the advertisement in the paper for auditions with the circus. "We need 
dancers. Do you want to travel?" I just couldn't believe it. A lot of things 
were happening in my life. I was working at a bookstore. I was going to the 
community college taking dancing, not sure what my major was, not sure what I 
was going to do with my life. Wanting desperately to travel. And this was my 
ticket out. 
</P>
<P>
So I went down to the Sports Arena, auditioned and they told me they would keep 
my name on file and let me know if an opening came up. Nothing ever happened. 
So, when the circus came around the next year, I tried out again. They told me 
again they would keep my name on file. But I kept letting them know I was 
interested and was just real persistent. 
</P>
<P>
They finally called me and asked me to tour with them in 1985. It was an 
emphatic "Yes!" So then I had to quit my job, finish school early, say goodby 
to family and friends, and get together everything I needed for a year in a 
couple of suitcases. I left two weeks later. I was a very naive 21. It was my 
first plane flight, my first time away from home. And I'm going away to the 
circus! 
</P>
<P>
As a dancer, you're there to add the color and the glitz and the glamour and to 
help fill out the production number -- to make it seem like WOW! You dance four 
numbers; the opening, the finale, the spectacular before intermission, and the 
elephant number. This year the girls are riding elephants. I never got the 
opportunity to ride the elephants, but I did climb web, which is a rope that 
you climb up, which is very difficult. But, after you got up there and put your 
hand and your foot in the rope and you do the tricks, you feel so pretty. It's 
really a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
There are only 12 to 16 dancers in the circus. It is pretty elite when you stop 
to think about it. Circus dancing is not the most technical and is not the most 
difficult dancing in the world. It's not Broadway. But the hard part is being 
consistent, doing it 13 times a week and making it look like it's the first 
time you've done it. And that's difficult at times when you just got your mail 
and there's some bad news from home in the letter that you just read in the 
dressing room, and you have to go out and put on this purple-and-orange sequin 
costume and look like you're having a ball. 
</P>
<P>
It was like I was driven to join the circus, and I believe it was what the Lord 
wanted for me. I've changed a lot. I think about the kind of person I was when 
I first went; I was a very introverted person, I was very shy, and I can't 
believe I did it, in retrospect. 
</P>
<P>
One time, I was in a telephone booth in Baltimore calling my sister and they 
were lining up the elephants for the elephant number, and I'm sitting there 
talking and not paying any attention, and I feel the telephone booth moving. I 
thought, what's going on here. It was the elephant's trunk nudging the booth. 
Where else would this happen? 
</P>
<P>
The greatest thing the circus taught me is to be open-minded about people; 
because you're cutting meat for the tigers doesn't mean you're any different 
than someone doing an aerial act. I don't know if you've heard the quote by 
Mark Twain, "Travel is fatal to bigotry and prejudice," and it's so true. He 
also said, "Broad wholesome views of the world cannot be obtained by living in 
a little corner of the world your whole life." I've found people who tend to be 
narrow-minded are the ones who never venture out.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-CITY OFFICIAL CLAIMS BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former El Segundo Public Works Director Bill Glickman, who was abruptly fired 
in April after 18 years on the job, has filed a $3 million age discrimination 
claim against the city. 
</P>
<P>
In his claim, Glickman, 55, also contends that his rights to a hearing were 
violated when he was terminated. As a result, Glickman contends in his claim, 
his reputation has been hurt, and he has suffered emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman was fired by then-City Manager Fred Sorsabal, who has since left the 
city to become Mission Viejo's city manager. At the time of the firing, 
Sorsabal would say only that his action adhered to city personnel regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Those regulations specify that department heads, including the public works 
director, serve at the pleasure of the city manager and can be terminated at 
any time. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman, who earned $79,560 annually, has said that he was not told why he was 
being let go. 
</P>
<P>
Council members have 45 days to act on the claim. If they deny it, Glickman can 
file a lawsuit against the city.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE SHOOT, KILL EX-CONVICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 34-year-old convicted burglar who had been released from state prison 2 1/2 
months ago was shot and killed by Inglewood police as he attempted to flee in a 
stolen car, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Sgt. Bill Thompson said two patrol officers spotted Christopher 
Garrett Grant when he ran a stop sign near Centinela Park in Inglewood at about 
11:20 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
When the officers attempted to stop Grant, he led officers on a two-minute 
chase at speeds as high as 70 m.p.h., Thompson said. At the intersection of 
Stepney Place and Park Avenue, the suspect lost control of his car. The 1978 
Mazda later was found to have been stolen, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, whose names were not made public, attempted to arrest Grant, but 
he took off again with one officer holding on to the side of the car for about 
25 feet, Thompson said. The officer fired his service revolver, fell to the 
ground and continued firing as the car drove off, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
The other officer, thinking his partner had been shot, also fired at the 
suspect, Thompson said. Grant, who suffered a single gunshot wound, lost 
control of the car, fled on foot and collapsed. He was declared dead at the 
scene. The officer who fell suffered no serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Grant, whose address is unknown, had been convicted of nine burglaries, had 14 
aliases and five Social Security numbers, according to authorities.

CARSON TO CONSIDER AID TO TRAILER PARK RENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Carson City Council has decided to look into reallocating $164,100 in 
federal Community Development Block Grant Funds to help 50 residents of the 
Nu-Way Mobilehome Park buy the park from a developer who plans to build a 
shopping mall on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The park residents applied for the city's block grant funds weeks after Carson 
had already allocated its $1.7 million in funds to four other city projects. If 
the city approves the Nu-Way application, it will have to transfer money it 
promised to one or more of the other projects. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Jack Smith said it is too early to tell if the city will 
reallocate the funds. Applications for block grant funds must be reviewed by a 
city advisory panel, which makes recommendations to the City Council. A public 
hearing at a weekly City Council meeting also is required. The Nu-Way 
application will be reviewed next month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Five-Acre Lot 
</P>
<P>
The four projects that were approved for block grant funds in April involve 
housing rehabilitation, street improvements, fair housing and public services, 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The park residents are hoping to buy 4.5 acres of the five-acre lot for $1.5 
million through the state's Mobile Home Park Assistance Program. 
</P>
<P>
To buy the park, residents are seeking $396,000 from the state program, 
$164,100 in block grant funds, $586,341 in bank financing and a $297,436 loan 
from the developer, Knickerbocker &amp; Associates, who bought the property in 
May, 1988. Residents will also pay $57,500 of their own money for the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Gibbs, an attorney representing the park residents, said the next time 
the group can apply for the state funds is September. 
</P>
<P>
But Nu-Way owner Craig Knickerbocker said that may be too late. "My investors 
have been waiting for over a year now. I'm getting real hard-pressed to tell 
them to wait," the developer said. "They either want to see the residents get 
their funding approved soon or else build a shopping mall."

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
The Carson City Council has allocated $1,077,377 in federal Community Block 
Grant funds to four city projects. A story on July 23 reported an incorrect 
figure. If the city decides to approve an application by residents of the 
Nu-Way Mobilehome Park for $164,100 in block grant funds, the money will come 
out of roll-over housing rehabilitation funds from previous years, according to 
Louis Lusiero, community development grant coordinator. Based on information 
from other city officials, the July 23 story incorrectly said that the city 
would take the money from the four projects that were approved earlier this 
year.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FISCAL PINCH MAY COST 32 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Hawthorne may have to eliminate a fire station and lay off as many 
as 32 employees to resolve a $2.5-million budget deficit for 1989-90, City 
Manager R. Kenneth Jue said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Jue said the city budget is "in serious trouble" because paramedic fees and 
sales tax revenues have not met expectations. Those revenues were $1.1 million 
short of projections in 1988-89 and are expected to be short $1.1 million again 
in 1989-90, Jue said. 
</P>
<P>
Layoffs could include as many as 12 firefighters, four police officers and 
workers from various other departments, Jue said. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of key department heads at City Hall has recommended an alternative 
proposal to resolve the deficit by raising city fees. If adopted by the council 
at a budget hearing Aug. 21, this plan would generate slightly more than the 
necessary $2.5 million needed to balance the city's $44.8-million budget for 
1989-90.

JIM MURRAY: THE CATCH IS DISTANT NO. 2 FOR SHERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ball was right there where it had to be. It floated toward the receiver's 
chest. He only had to leap three feet forward, tuck it in and dash across the 
goal line six yards away. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Sherman put the ball away, wheeled and streaked through the end zone 
triumphantly. Behind him, the burned defender clasped his hands to his forehead 
and moaned. On the sideline, his coach did the same thing, and Life magazine 
forever captured the instant in a full-page photo. 
</P>
<P>
When you beat Notre Dame with a touchdown with a minute to play, you never 
forget it. In this case, neither did anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
The time was 1964, the circumstances were these: Notre Dame, in Coach Ara 
Parseghian's first season, was undefeated. Its student body was shrieking, 
"We're No. 1!" and so were the Cadillac alumni in the stands. It led all the 
polls, it had rolled over nine opponents without even breathing hard. It had a 
soon-to-be Heisman Trophy winner at quarterback (John Huarte) and two future 
Super Bowl players, defensive tackle Alan Page and linebacker Jim Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
It was at least a 10-point favorite over a USC team that had been beaten three 
times and wasn't even going to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The game started out as if the oddsmakers knew what they were talking about. 
The anthem had barely died down before the Irish had opened a 17-0 lead. Page 
kept throwing ballcarriers around like sacks of mail. Lynch kept batting down 
passes, and Huarte kept hitting Jack Snow with long passes. 
</P>
<P>
But in the second half, USC crept up and, suddenly, with the score, 17-13, and 
1:33 left, it had the ball on the 15-yard-line, fourth and eight. 
</P>
<P>
In Trojan lore, it will always be known as The Catch. There are many great 
moments in Trojan-Irish history. The Kick is one of them. That would be the 
fourth-quarter field goal Johnny Baker kicked to win the 1931 game at South 
Bend and end a 2 1/2-year undefeated streak by Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
But The Catch is another of them. It is frozen in time. One of the watershed 
moments in a 60-game rivalry that had many of them. 
</P>
<P>
The picture of that historic reception by No. 12 hangs in Heritage Hall but 
it's engraved on every fan's heart everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Sherman, who caught that memorable pass, came to USC as a quarterback. He 
played that position in high school and at UCLA for one abortive year. 
</P>
<P>
But, at USC, they already had a quarterback, Craig Fertig, and with 9.8 speed 
in the hundred, Sherman looked to Trojan Coach John McKay like a better bet at 
flanker. 
</P>
<P>
McKay had just sent Sherman into the game at that critical juncture in 1964. 
Rod was on the bench as he watched Alan Page brutally sacking quarterback 
Fertig twice (once forcing the ball out of Fertig's grasp, but it was ruled an 
incomplete pass). 
</P>
<P>
Sherman sidled up to Coach McKay. "How about an 85-Z Delay?" he suggested. "Go 
ahead, try it," McKay agreed, shoving Sherman into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"You could do those things with Coach McKay," recalls Sherman, who was only a 
sophomore that day. "Another coach might say, 'Sit down and shut up, I'm 
running the team here!' But not Coach McKay. He listened to you." 
</P>
<P>
It was a good thing. The fourth-down play worked to perfection. A short pass 
over the middle, a slip for Notre Dame defender Tony Carey -- and The Catch 
went into the modern annals of the Trojan wars. 
</P>
<P>
You might think that was the greatest triumph in the life and times of Rod 
Sherman. After all, it has grown in legend till in the retelling it has a 
nine-yard pass growing to a length-of-the-field bomb. "Everything but me 
throwing and then catching the pass," Sherman said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
But it is a distant second to the game-winning score Sherman racked up only a 
few years ago. It happened as he was sunning himself after a workout at the UC 
Irvine campus. "A friend of mine looked down on my thigh and he saw what looked 
to be two very dark freckles merging. He kind of frowned. 'You ever get that 
looked at?' he asked me. I said, 'No, but I will.' 'You better,' he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman went to the hospital. " 'Ninety-five per cent of these things are 
benign,' they tell me. But I hit the jackpot. A 90-1 shot came in. It was a 
melanoma. The Big C. When I woke up I had this divot in my leg that made it 
look like a satellite photo of the moon. The doctor told me any more time and 
they would have had to remove all the lymph nodes. It was malignant. Much 
longer and I would be dead. 
</P>
<P>
So far as Rod Sherman was concerned, that was The Catch of his career. Cancer 
is tougher to get in the clear on than Tony Carey, tougher to beat than Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Sherman has been in a Rose Bowl (1966) and a Super Bowl (Oakland, 1968) but 
the most critical seconds of his life were not spent in an end zone but on an 
operating table. 
</P>
<P>
Next Saturday night, at the Rose Bowl, Rod Sherman and The Catch, along with 
Trojan football players Pete Beathard and C.R. Roberts, Cal's Craig Morton and 
UCLA's Foster Andersen will be honored at halftime and inducted into the Shrine 
Hospital Hall of Fame at the 38th annual Shriners North-South football game. 
</P>
<P>
This is a game which pays for new legs for those who were born without any, new 
bones for those whose are so brittle they break on contact, new hands for those 
who didn't form any. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman played in this game 27 years ago. "When I see those kids, I don't thank 
God I had the speed to make that catch. I thank God I had the arms and hands."

TOO MUCH TIME, NOT ENOUGH MILES LEFT FOR LEMOND?

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After about 2,000 miles of cycling over the past 22 days, the Tour de France 
has been reduced to this: 
</P>
<P>
Greg LeMond of Minneapolis, 50 seconds behind Laurent Fignon of France, needs a 
fantastic finish in today's 15-mile time trial to win his second title. He 
needs to make up three seconds a mile against Fignon in the final stage. 
</P>
<P>
His chances, by most accounts, are slim. 
</P>
<P>
"There's little chance, but I'll still be going for it," LeMond said. "I feel 
good." 
</P>
<P>
The distance from Versailles to Paris is considered too short for LeMond to 
overcome the difference, even if LeMond is a better time-trial rider than 
Fignon, who won the tour in 1983 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, LeMond said he would have a chance if Fignon's lead was a 
maximum 30 to 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
In the two previous tour time trials this year, LeMond won by an average of 53 
seconds. But both were considerably longer -- one almost three times the 
distance -- than the Versailles-Paris stage. Also, the final leg is almost flat 
except for a modest downhill in the first five miles. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond said he will be content with a second-place finish considering that he 
almost died two years ago when he was shot by a brother-in-law in a hunting 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
"First time back on the tour since 1986, I can't complain," LeMond said. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond is the only U.S. cyclist to win the tour, the world's most prestigious 
bicycling race, when he placed first in 1986 after being third and second the 
two previous years. 
</P>
<P>
He missed the last two tours because of the shooting and other misfortune, such 
as an emergency appendectomy and shin problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If I get first or second, I think I've raced as well as Fignon or (Pedro) 
Delgado," LeMond said. "I had no idea I was going to ride this well. I had some 
hopes I was maybe going to win a stage, maybe a top-20 finish. I was really 
going to be happy with that." 
</P>
<P>
Delgado, of Spain, won last year and was third, 2 minutes 28 seconds behind 
Fignon, entering today's final stage. He was victim of some misfortune as he 
arrived 2:40 late for the prologue July 1 in Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
If LeMond gains more than 12 seconds today, the race will be the closest in its 
86-year history. The smallest previous margin of victory was Dutch rider Jan 
Janssen's 38-second win over Belgian Herman van Springel in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
The gap between Fignon and LeMond has never been more than a minute in one of 
the closest and most exciting tours. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, all but one of the 138 remaining competitors were credited with the 
same time as the cyclists rode on a hot afternoon through east-central France. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond was 40th and Fignon 50th on a relaxed day before the finale. 
</P>
<P>
Gianni Fidanza of Italy took the 20th stage, from Aix-les-Bains to l'Isle 
d'Abeau, a new industrial city outside Lyon. Fidanza won the sprint finish 
ahead of the pack in 3 hours 26 minutes 16 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Kelly of Ireland, who recently lost his No. 1 world ranking after seven 
years, was third. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very frustrating because this was my last chance for a stage win," 
Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Fignon is on the verge of becoming the sixth rider to win the Tour de France 
three times and the sixth to win the tours of Italy and France in the same 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Monique Knol of the Netherlands stopped Jeannie Longo's 
winning streak at five as she took the 10th stage of the women's Tour de 
France. 
</P>
<P>
However, Longo, of France, held an insurmountable lead with one stage left. She 
was 16th for the day but in the same time as Knol and had an 8-minute 44-second 
margin over runner-up Maria Canins of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Knol, who won the first two stages then fell behind, outsprinted the rest of 
the pack in a group finish, running the same route as the men but two hours 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
However, Knol's time of 3:16:05, was about 10 minutes faster than the men's 
race as the men took their time over the 79-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
Longo, who had won the five previous stages, with Canins second in four of 
them, should take her third consecutive women's title today, barring a mishap. 
</P>
<P>
Americans Inga Thompson and Susan Elias were third and fourth, respectively, 
pacing the United States into the lead in the overall team standings. They held 
a five-minute lead over Italy based on the top three riders.

WATSON WITHIN SHOT OF LEAD AFTER A 68;

HE WILL SEEK SIXTH TITLE IN EVENT TODAY; GRADY IS ONE TO CATCH

<TEXT>
<P>
It would be fitting for Tom Watson to win the 118th British Open at Royal 
Troon. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a great player, who has been in a slump, coming back to win on a 
familiar course in a prestigious tournament that he has won five previous 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Watson was in that position Saturday after shooting a 68 for a 54-hole total of 
205, 11 under par and one stroke behind Australia's Wayne Grady. 
</P>
<P>
The seaside Royal Troon course continued to yield low scores on another warm 
and virtually windless day. The British Open conjures images of howling winds 
and relentless rain. Not this year, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen any British Open course play as benignly as this one," said 
Watson, who won his fourth Open championship here in 1982 by coming from three 
strokes behind on the final day to beat Bobby Clampett. 
</P>
<P>
An American hasn't won the British Open since Watson did it at Royal Birkdale 
in 1983, but the odds favor the United States now. 
</P>
<P>
Payne Stewart was two strokes behind Grady at 206, while Fred Couples and Mark 
Calcavecchia were grouped with Northern Ireland's David Feherty at 207. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Azinger and Jodie Mudd were at 208, while 22-year-old Jose Maria Olazabal 
of Spain, former UCLA star Steve Pate and Mark McCumber were at 209. 
</P>
<P>
Grady, the 36-hole leader, held his ground and shot what he called a scrambling 
69 for his 204 total. 
</P>
<P>
Seldom has a leader been so overlooked -- the result of the attention paid to 
the 39-year-old Watson. 
</P>
<P>
"After reading the papers for 15 minutes today I found out I was leading," 
Grady said wryly. "However, if I win tomorrow, I'll get a lot of headlines." 
</P>
<P>
The headlines today, however, belong mainly to Watson, who hasn't won on the 
PGA Tour since the Nabisco Championships in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He had almost been written off as a factor on the world scene, falling from the 
eminence he shared with Jack Nicklaus in the 1970s and part of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Nick Faldo, a pre-tournament favorite who is out contention, said 
Watson was the player to beat today. 
</P>
<P>
"Any day the wind is blowing left to right on the back nine and you can drive 
the ball into the wind, I'd have my money on Watson," Faldo said. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the conditions Saturday, and they're expected to remain about the 
same today. 
</P>
<P>
When told of Faldo's comments, Watson said, "I don't know who will win 
tomorrow, but I hope I do. If I shoot 85, or 65, I hope it's one shot better 
than the rest of the field." 
</P>
<P>
A sixth Open victory today would tie Harry Vardon's record established in the 
early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think having won five Opens will hurt," Watson said. "And when you win 
on a course, it's easier to win the second time because you have the same 
feeling and you don't forget that. I've never forgotten the feeling I had here 
in 1982." 
</P>
<P>
Said Stewart, who shot a 69 while being paired with Grady: "If I wasn't picking 
myself, I probably would pick Tom." 
</P>
<P>
Grady, however, doesn't seem to be intimidated. The 32-year-old player from 
Queensland, who scored his first tour victory last June in the Westchester 
tournament, was asked how he felt going into today's final round. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bloody good, man," he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he added, "I made a good round out of a so-so round. I hit my irons very 
poorly, but I drove the ball, chipped and putted well." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he enjoyed his front-running role, Grady said calmly, "I'd rather be 
there than four shots behind." 
</P>
<P>
Grady had three birdies on the more difficult back nine, getting two of them 
with a 20-foot chip shot and a 60-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, who had four birdies during his round, said his short game and putting 
rescued him. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel nervous, yet confident," he said. "A lot of good things are happening. 
I can't wait until tomorrow to put it to the test." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was the most colorfully attired player, wearing hot-pink plus fours and 
a shirt with the logo of the Phoenix Cardinals of the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best position I've ever been in in a major," he said. "I came out 
with the idea of playing a good, solid round, which I did -- and nobody ran 
away from the field. Tomorrow's the day you win, and that's what I plan to do." 
</P>
<P>
Couples and Calcavecchia, who shot 68s, were paired Saturday and it was a good 
match. Both are known as long hitters (Couples' nickname is Boom Boom). 
</P>
<P>
Couples would be in even a better position if he hadn't bogeyed the last hole 
-- just as he had done Friday -- when his drive found a pot bunker. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever gets off to the best start tomorrow will be hard to catch," he said. 
"The way the course is playing, guys can't just make pars to win, they'll have 
to make birdies." 
</P>
<P>
Feherty, who shot a 69, doesn't have credentials as imposing as the other 
contenders. Nonethless, he doesn't seem to be awed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have very little experience of being so close in the big majors," he said. 
"I'm not saying I'm going to win, but I want to know what it's like to be in 
that position." 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, Feherty was being groomed as both a singer and a golfer. For 
relaxation he listens to Puccini. 
</P>
<P>
"I would still like to play on the U.S. tour," he said. "I've tried four times 
and I've been unsuccessful." 
</P>
<P>
Azinger, who shot a 67, is still in the hunt. But he reasoned that he would be 
even closer to Grady if he had been able to make birdie putts ranging from 15 
to 18 feet on six greens. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow, nerves will play a big part. I think it's hard to be a 
front-runner," he said. "It's easier for someone to come from farther back. If 
I were in the lead, I'd want bad weather and just hang on." 
</P>
<P>
That isn't likely, according to the weather forecast. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger played with Mudd, who shot a 68 even though he said he was distracted 
by cameras and a television cart. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't used to the aggressiveness of those people," Mudd said. "There were 
30 cameramen out there taking pictures of my downswing. I got pretty rattled. 
It's my first Open here, so I'll have to get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Watson doesn't have that problem. The British Open is old hat to him and he 
would like to prove that his experience is invaluable today. 
</P>
<P>
British Open Notes 
</P>
<P>
Larry Mize had the low round of the day with a 66. He was at 211. . . . Tom 
Kite, who shot a 67 and was also at 211, said the course is defenseless: "Soft 
greens, no wind and no rain." . . . Scott Simpson, the former USC star, shot a 
72 after moving close to the leaders with a 66 Friday. He was also at 211. . . 
. Curtis Strange, the two-time U.S. Open champion, shot his second consecutive 
74 and was at 218. . . . Bernhard Langer, the 1985 Masters champion, had the 
worst round of the day, an 83. 
</P>
<P>
All three of the Ozaki brothers, Jumbo, Jet and Joe, made the cut. . . . Payne 
Stewart was rolling in putts on the practice green before the round, prompting 
Wayne Grady to ask, "Did you sleep with that thing (putter) last night?" . . . 
John Saddler, a columnist for the Sun, a British tabloid, wrote that he was 
snubbed by Strange after asking what Saddler acknowledged was a dumb question. 
Nonetheless, Saddler wrote: "I am told he's a firm admirer of John McEnroe. I 
can't say I'm surprised."

NFL DECRIES LOTTERY; OREGON CITES DOUBLE STANDARD 
</P>

<BYLINE>

By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year is 1977. The then-Oakland Raiders are playing the then-Baltimore Colts 
in an American Football Conference playoff game for the right to advance to the 
conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The score is tied after regulation play, 31-31, and still tied after a full 
overtime period. In the second overtime, the Raiders drive toward the Colt end 
zone at the open end of Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes down to second-and-goal at the Baltimore eight. It comes down to 
Coach John Madden. Go for the field goal in the tricky winds at this end of the 
field, or go for the touchdown? 
</P>
<P>
 Madden opts for a safe pass with the idea of kicking, if necessary, on third 
down. It never comes to that. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Stabler's pass is not only safe but sure, landing in the hands of tight 
end Dave Casper for the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders celebrate their 37-31 victory all the way to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But there, the scene turns ugly. An angry fan steps out of the shadows and 
goes after Madden with every four-letter word in his vocabulary. Arms waving, 
lungs pumping, he berates the Raider coach for his game-deciding decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Colt fanatic? No, gambling fanatic. The man had bet on Baltimore and taken 3 
1/2 points. A field goal would have made him a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen years later, that story is still repeated in NFL circles. Especially 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In fearful tones. 
</P>
<P>
 To the NFL, it's a dangerous gamble. 
</P>
<P>
To the University of Oregon and Oregon State, it's a sure bet. 
</P>
<P>
To the people of Oregon, it could become an odds-on favorite. 
</P>
<P>
It's the NFL lottery. Approved by the Oregon Lottery Commission last week, that 
state's newest game is predicated on beating the point spread rather than the 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
Sweat a lot when you scratch those lottery cards with a coin? Agonize when you 
have to decide between your birthdate and that of your mother-in-law for Lotto 
6/49? Get nervous when a fellow worker offers you an illegal betting card? 
</P>
<P>
No such problems in Oregon starting in September. All you do is plop down a 
dollar and pick the winners of between four and all 14 of the week's NFL games, 
based on point spreads set by Nevada oddsmakers. A perfect four for four will 
pay about $8. Fourteen for 14 could be good for $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a year when the Pete Rose gambling scandal has cast a shadow, deserved or 
not, on baseball's integrity, and Gamblers Anonymous has gained as much 
visibility as Alcoholics Anonymous, the NFL suddenly finds itself faced with 
the institutionalizing of that activity. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe, judging by phone calls we have received, that this is not an 
isolated incident," said Pete Abitante, information director for the American 
Football Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Every state in the country is looking at this type of lottery and several, 
beginning with Iowa, are said to be very interested in starting one. 
</P>
<P>
"Legalized gambling of any sort goes to the fabric of our game, to our 
integrity. Instead of the fans asking of their teams, 'Did they win?' they'll 
be asking, 'Did they cover the point spread?' The focus should be on the game 
and the players, not whether they cover the spread." 
</P>
<P>
League officials are considering legal action to block the venture. 
</P>
<P>
While individual team officials will not comment, one club executive asked, off 
the record: "What's next? Pari-mutuel windows at the stadium?" 
</P>
<P>
NFL attorney Jim Noel urged Oregon Lottery Commission members to "send a 
message that the state of Oregon will not be the place that triggers the 
insidious specter of nationwide legalized gambling that could, among its 
negative effects, fundamentally alter and injure professional sports in 
America." 
</P>
<P>
The message that was delivered, however, is that Oregon is sick and tired of 
producing inferior athletic programs. So the state legislature has paved what 
it thinks will be a road to glory with gold. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery gold. 
</P>
<P>
"The state of Oregon is finally going to take action in funding its college 
athletics," said David Dix, majority leader of the Oregon House of 
Representatives. "Our schools won't be facing any more David-vs.-Goliath 
matches against teams from better-funded states." 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight percent of the net proceeds from the NFL lottery, to a maximum of 
$8 million per year, will go to the sports programs at Oregon's seven 
state-supported colleges and universities, with the remaining percentage 
ticketed for scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see the schools get their money through some way other than 
gambling," said Duane Lindberg, assistant commissioner of the Pacific 10 
Conference, "but if the state is not going to provide it any other way, so be 
it. States throughout the country help out their schools, so it is not that 
unusual to be getting funding. Obviously, the aspect of the gambling is a new 
twist. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot is still unknown at this time. We don't know how much the Oregon schools 
will get. But we know that both programs (Oregon and Oregon State) are hurting 
and the figures we've seen will only help them get closer to the level of other 
programs in the conference." 
</P>
<P>
And it's about time, said Dave Williford, a spokesman for the University of 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"We were obviously pleased with the news that the state legislature has agreed 
to give us money," Williford said. "That's the first time we've been given 
state support. Of all the state schools, we (Oregon and Oregon State) are among 
the few in the country who don't receive any support. We have been trying to 
get some for a long time, so this is something of a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
"What seems two-faced to us about the NFL is their contention that the lottery 
is bad when they turn their backs on Nevada. We're talking small scale here, 
maybe a dollar a ticket, compared to who knows what in Nevada." 
</P>
<P>
 NFL headquarters is not the only place warning flags are flying. Oregon 
lottery officials have said that if their new game works, National Basketball 
Assn. games could be next. 
</P>
<P>
That prompted this statement from Russ Granik, an NBA executive vice-president: 
"The NBA is adamantly opposed to gambling on professional team sports. Gambling 
on NBA games is contrary to the entertainment package that we seek to provide 
to the public, and we feel it is inappropriate for any state agency to consider 
interfering with our business in this way." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the NFL nor the NBA seem to have anything to worry about as far as 
California is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"Our research has not shown games based on the outcome of sporting results is 
of great interest," said Joanne McNabb, spokesperson for the California 
Lottery. "We are looking to maximize revenues for education and meet our 
players' desires. And this idea (the NFL lottery) just hasn't loomed large as 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't loom too large in Delaware, either, when an NFL lottery became 
reality back in 1976. The NFL sued to stop it, but that proved unnecessary when 
Delaware officials dropped the game after one season. Projected revenues of $6 
million to $8 million fell far short, at $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment in Delaware doesn't alarm the Oregon people, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a look at what is successful in Europe, what is successful in Nevada," 
said Steve Caputo, deputy director of the Oregon Lottery. "We did market 
research and this one (the NFL game) had greatest potential for new money for 
state programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel they made two mistakes in Delaware. That's why it was a massive 
failure. First, they used a fixed payout. We use a pari-mutuel payout. For 
every person who hit 14 for 14, they had to pay out $8,000, which means it 
could cost them $8 million. We have only so much money in the prize pool. The 
winners just share it. That limits the risk of the state, but over time, the 
payouts are about the same. 
</P>
<P>
"The second mistake in Delaware is that they thought they were smart enough and 
knew the game well enough to set their own point spreads. They were incorrect. 
We are going to use a professional oddsmaker out of Vegas who supplies the odds 
to the sports books." 
</P>
<P>
What about the NFL position that the whole idea is a mistake? 
</P>
<P>
"We are really mystified by that," Caputo said. "Here is a person going down 
and spending maybe $2 on four teams while, in Nevada, thousands are wagered. 
The NFL turns their backs on that, but they are concerned about our lottery. I 
don't see how a housewife in Oregon is going to affect the integrity of the 
NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Neither does Mike Tenay, a supervisor at the race and sports book of the Gold 
Coast Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"There is definitely a double standard by the NFL," Tenay said. "I know they 
don't go out of their way to promote gambling on NFL games in Vegas, but they'd 
be crazy not to admit that gambling has helped the sport to prosper as much as 
anything. I think the combination of gambling and TV has made the NFL what it 
is today." 
</P>
<P>
Tenay and others in Nevada are watching the Oregon experiment with interest, 
but not much trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not that big a worry at this time," Tenay said. "If other states 
follow, we might worry. But really, their payoffs are nowhere near what we pay 
off." 
</P>
<P>
That's true. Figuring you get about $8 back in Oregon for picking four of four 
on a $1 wager, that's 7-1 odds. At someplace like the Gold Coast, a successful 
four-team parlay pays back at 10-1, a five-team parlay at 25-1. 
</P>
<P>
As for the 14-for-14 winners, don't hold your breath. Tenay estimates that at 
the Gold Coast and Las Vegas' Barbary Coast Hotel and Casino combined, there 
have been perhaps three winners on the 15-team parlay in the last seven years. 
And those winners got to choose their 15 games from a selection of pro and 
college games. In Oregon, you have to go with the week's pro slate. 
</P>
<P>
"In the overall scheme, I don't think it could really hurt Vegas sports 
betting," Tenay said. "We have people who bet $2,000 to $5,000 a game. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, it might educate people to sports betting. We've got so many 
squares who walk in for the Super Bowl and are not familiar with point spreads. 
A guy walks in on a Saturday and sees 75 college games and point spreads, he 
doesn't know where to start. This might be an educational tool." 
</P>
<P>
It is expected to be an educational tool of a different sort in Oregon. 
According to Caputo, the NFL lottery cards, costing a minimum of $1 and a 
maximum of $20, should generate anywhere between $10 million and $30 million 
for the season. From that, the state's seven state colleges and universities 
will receive between $4 million and $9 million, with Oregon and Oregon State 
getting perhaps as much as $3 million each. That money must be divided between 
men's and women's programs (at least 50% for the women), and between revenue 
and nonrevenue-producing sports (70% for the nonrevenue), according to a 
formula devised by the state legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got mixed feelings about it," conceded Jack Davis, associate athletic 
director at Oregon State. "We have made many efforts to get funding. It always 
has seemed that attempts by the legislature failed. Last year, there was a 
public referendum for a tax on cigarettes and beer to get us funding, but that 
failed. We went the last mile. The lottery money was a last-ditch effort. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't see where the type of payoff we have would affect the integrity of 
the game. The stakes in the NFL are too big for the amount of money involved, 
$8,000 maximum. That's small compared to what's going on in Nevada. This is 
really a game of chance. People are going to play it more for fun, like an 
office pool." 
</P>
<P>
But, Davis acknowledged, there is a drawback. "A lot of us in athletics don't 
like to tie gambling to intercollegiate athletics," he said. "We wish it could 
have been done some other way. Maybe, in time, we'll find other ways to finance 
our programs. Personally, I don't like that type of gambling. I voted against 
the lottery. I think it impacts the wrong type of people. I don't like the 
message it sends. But if it is tied to our ability to compete in the Pac-10, 
we'll take the money."

GORDON SCORES EASY VICTORY WITHOUT ANY ROUGH STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robby Gordon, off-road racing's 20-year-old star from Orange, showed he could 
win without the rough driving tactics that have characterized his season by 
running away with the Grand National truck main event Saturday night at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
An enthusiastic crowd of 45,156 sat in on Round 9 of the Mickey Thompson 
Off-Road Championship Gran Prix. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, winner of the previous two races at the Houston Astrodome and the Rose 
Bowl, led off the line in his Jeep Comanche, but Gordon -- choosing the longer 
but faster outside line through the peristyle arches in his Toyota -- passed 
the 50-year-old veteran coming down the ramp onto the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
From then on, it was merely a question of Gordon not making any mistakes -- and 
he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth win in seven races for Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Stewart, Gordon's teammate, made it a 1-2 finish for Toyota, with Rob 
MacCachren of Las Vegas, Evans' teammate, narrowly edging Danny Thompson, in a 
Chevrolet, in the final few feet for third place in the 12-lap race. Evans, who 
had been chasing Gordon, lost several positions when he got stuck behind the 
arches. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon and Evans, as expected, dominated the heats, both of which were cleanly 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon started sixth in the first eight-lap heat, and after trailing Thompson 
and Evans for three laps, he grabbed the lead by taking his favorite line 
through the arches, coming out ahead of Evans and alongside Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
In the race down the bumpy back straightaway, the two battled wheel-to-wheel 
until Gordon swept in front at the west end. 
</P>
<P>
Evans had it easier in the second heat as he jumped into the lead off the 
starting line and was never challenged. Gordon, who started last as a result of 
winning the first heat, finished third, behind Thompson, after moving up when 
MacCachren and Roger Mears dropped out. Each was running second at the time. 
MacCachren crashed into a barrier, while Mears pulled off the track just before 
the start of the final lap. 
</P>
<P>
Brea's Brad Castle scored his first win of the season in the Super 1600 buggy 
class, followed by Danny Rice and Mitch Mustard, winner of the trophy dash. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Noel of Concord, driving in his first ultrastock stadium race, upset 
favorites Lloyd Castle, Jeff Elrod and Vince Tjelmeland, the season leader. 
TJ's Nissan was second when it lost a wheel. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Shepherd of Bakersfield won his first four-wheel ATV main event as 
favored Marty Hart of El Cajon failed to finish. John Gersjes of South Gate 
also was a first-time winner in the super lites class. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson Vohland of Sacramento won his fourth straight ultracross race -- the 
Mickey Thompson version of motocross. 
</P>
<P>
The 660-yard track, fastest in stadium history, took its toll of machinery as a 
number of vehicles, particularly the super-swift Super 1600 buggies, tangled 
with one another and the water barriers that defined the inside of the course. 
It was easy to tell when a car made contact with the barriers as it sent water 
spraying over the cars. 
</P>
<P>
For some reason, the Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group kept the spectators in 
the dark as far as results were concerned, treating them instead to a 
three-hour commercial.

MAGICAL MILE CRUISES TO VICTORY IN JUVENILE; 
</P>
<P>
COLT MOVES UP TO SIX FURLONGS AND WINS BY FOUR LENGTHS AT HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye is racing's canary in a coal mine. When he gets excited, 
it's time to run. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Delahoussaye's assessment of Magical Mile, four-length winner of the 
$106,200 Hollywood Juvenile Championship Saturday at Hollywood Park, should be 
filed away. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned not to get too high on a 2-year-old," the 37-year-old former 
national champion said. "I had my heart broken too many times when I was 
younger. But this colt acts like he might be something special." 
</P>
<P>
The colt won his first race on May 18 by 7 1/2 lengths, setting a track record 
for five furlongs in the process. Each 2-year-old who came along afterward 
inevitably was compared to Magical Mile. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Magical Mile was made the 3-5 favorite for the Juvenile Championship, 
with only Forty Niner Days, at about 4-1, given the slightest chance to upset. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking from the inside post, Magical Mile went right to the lead. Said 
Delahoussaye: "Around the turn he was loafing. But I kind of let him have his 
way, because I could feel the power was there whenever I wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
Magical Mile stayed on cruise control around the turn and into the stretch, 
taking the bend a bit wide. With a quarter of a mile to go, Forty Niner Days 
put in a threatening run along the inside. His jockey, Laffit Pincay, sensed a 
possible upset. 
</P>
<P>
"For a second, I thought I might win it," said Pincay, who has won the Juvenile 
a record six times. "Then Eddie asked his horse to run, and he re-broke. The 
race was over." 
</P>
<P>
Forty Niner Days was second by 3 1/2 lengths over Willing Worker. Real Cash, 
who tried to chase Magical Mile early, faded late to finish fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The winner paid $2.60, $2.20 and $2.10, while causing a minus show pool of 
$2,570. 
</P>
<P>
Magical Mile's time of 1:10 for the six furlongs was not particularly 
impressive, and his opposition was essentially unproven, but his performance 
holds up under close scrutiny on several counts. 
</P>
<P>
Magical Mile ran his final furlong in a world class :12 1/5. "And he was doing 
it easy, too," Delahoussaye said. "He could have run in nine and change with no 
problem, but what's the point?" 
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky bred colt lost a bit of training time shortly after his debut 
because of a minor bronchial ailment. But Stute had plenty of time to regroup. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way I was glad," said Stute, who has handled such top horses as June 
Darling, Figonero and Snow Sporting. "It seems they all come up with some 
little problem. Maybe he got his out of the way early." 
</P>
<P>
Magical Mile's sire, J.O. Tobin, was a brilliant racer but has been an object 
of scorn as a stallion. 
</P>
<P>
J.O. Tobin, England's champion 2-year-old of 1976, became the first horse to 
defeat Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew, in the 1977 Swaps Stakes at Hollywood 
Park. The next year, J.O. Tobin earned an Eclipse Award as North America's 
co-champion sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
But through the end of 1988 only one of his 20 stakes-winning sons and 
daughters had won a top-class race. 
</P>
<P>
Magical Mile was sold for $25,000 as a yearling in Kentucky and developed 
impressively enough to bring a bid of $190,000 from Clement L. Hirsch when he 
went through a sales ring in California last March. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is Delahoussaye's qualified endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'm tough to please," Delahoussaye said. "After they win the Triple 
Crown, then I'll call 'em great." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Sunday Silence will be an overwhelming 
favorite to win today's $412,400 Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park. The value of 
the race was doubled because of the presence of a Triple Crown race winner, but 
without Sunday Silence the field would be anemic. One of his four opponents has 
never raced against top company. . . . Olympic Prospect, California's best 
sprinter of 1988, made his 1989 debut Saturday and won a Breeders' Cup 
sponsored race at Louisiana Downs by 11 1/2 lengths. . . . Nastique, who won 
two stakes at Hollywood Park last fall for Bill Shoemaker, won the Delaware 
Handicap on Saturday for the second straight year while Shoemaker was making a 
special appearance at Wyoming Downs. . . . Saturday's attendance was 18,701 
compared to the final on-track count of 42,612 at the special Shoemaker 
celebration Friday night.

Blaine McCallister, trying to become the first player to defend his title 
successfully at Coal Valley, Ill., in 17 years, regained the lead in Saturday's 
third round of the $700,000 Hardee's golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
McCallister, who was the first-round leader with a 65, shot a three-under-par 
67 for a 54-hole total of nine-under-par 201. 
</P>
<P>
He rolled in a 20-foot putt from the edge of the green on No. 14 and holed a 
35-foot chip shot from the rough on No. 16 to go 10 under par, but he bogeyed 
No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
That put him a stroke ahead of Curt Byrum, John Adams and Lennie Clements, all 
looking for their first victory on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Byrum shot a 69 for his 202, while Adams and Clements had 67s. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Alcott shot her third straight four-under-par 68 to take a two-stroke lead 
after three rounds of the Boston Five tournament at the Tara Ferncroft Country 
Club in Danvers, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Alcott, who needs just three wins to get into the LPGA Hall of Fame, was at 
12-under-par 204. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Furlong birdied the last two holes after bogeying the 16th and finished 
with a 70 for a 206 total. Tied at 207 were Cathy Marino, Jody Rosenthal and 
Patty Sheehan. Sheehan and Rosenthal shot 68s, and Marino had a 71. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Henning shot a four-under-par 68 to take a one-stroke lead in the second 
round of the Ameritech Senior Open at the Canterbury Golf Club in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Henning, fifth on the Senior PGA Tour money list, was at nine-under-par 135. 
Jimmy Powell, who shot his second consecutive 68, was second at 136, and Bruce 
Crampton was at 137 after a 67. 
</P>
<P>
First-round co-leaders Dick Rhyan and Chick Evans both fell back. Rhyan shot a 
75 for a 141 total, while Evans had a 74 for a 140. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Stankowski of Oxnard, a junior at Texas El Paso, shot a four-under-par 68 
to take a one-stroke lead after three rounds of the Southern California Golf 
Assn. Amateur at Glendora Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Stankowski had a total of three-under-par 209. Mark Johnson of Barstow and John 
Pate of Santa Barbara shared second place at 210. Johnson shot a third-round 
69, and Pate, brother of PGA touring pro Steve Pate, had a 68.

The Raiders have released two veterans to make room on the roster for rookies, 
including second-round draft choice Steve Wisniewski. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran free-agent quarterback Mike Kelley was cut to make room for Wisniewski, 
and center George Lilja was dropped Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Wisniewski, an offensive lineman from Penn State taken with the 29th pick, 
signed Saturday morning and participated in two practices after missing the 
first day of two-a-day workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't much of a holdout," Wisniewski said. "I ran my 40-yard test before 
camp, I went downtown to take my physical before I came here, and I was staying 
at the team hotel (in El Segundo)." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders began camp with only six draft choices, two of whom were sent to 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for tests. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Gary Gooden of Indiana suffered a knee injury in practice Friday, 
while defensive lineman Charles Jackson from Jackson State has a nagging 
shoulder injury.

CONTROVERSIAL TRADES PAYING OFF FOR MARINERS, PHILLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ross Newhan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the Baltimore Orioles continue one of the most remarkable reversals in 
baseball history, there also have been positive developments for two other 
downtrodden organizations -- the Seattle Mariners and Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners have never finished at .500 or better, but they were there 
Thursday later than in any year except 1982, when they were 59-59 on Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The 47-47 record under Manager Jim Lefebvre marked a 10-game improvement over 
1988 and indication that two controversial trades may be paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brian Holman, Randy Johnson and Gene Harris, three prospects acquired from 
the Montreal Expos for Mark Langston, are a combined 8-7. Johnson has pitched 
into the seventh inning in seven of nine starts, and Holman has pitched two 
shutouts in his last four starts and combined on a third. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scott Bankhead, battling injuries after his 1987 acquisition from the 
Kansas City Royals for Danny Tartabull, is 10-4 with a club-record eight 
consecutive wins. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old right-hander had allowed only 11 earned runs in his last 10 
starts, replacing Langston as the ace of a rebuilt staff that entered the 
weekend with five shutouts and a 2.91 earned-run average over the last 21 
games, of which the Mariners won 15. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Seattle has six rookies playing pivotal roles: Johnson, Harris, center 
fielder Ken Griffey Jr. (who leads all major league rookies with 13 homers and 
45 runs batted in), left fielder Greg Briley (11 RBIs and a .424 average in his 
first eight games of the second half), shortstop Omar Vizquel and part-time 
third baseman Edgar Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder-designated hitter Jeffrey Leonard, who made the All-Star team; first 
baseman Alvin Davis, who should have made it, and second baseman Harold 
Reynolds, who has made it before, have helped provide leadership and stability 
under Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies' improvement has been less dramatic but still noteworthy. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the marquee names. Mike Schmidt retired in May, and Steve Bedrosian 
and Juan Samuel were traded in June. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies entered Saturday's play with a 14-14 record since the departure of 
Bedrosian and Samuel, and Manager Nick Levya said his goal is to win 50 games 
in the second half, an optimistic objective considering the 32 victories of the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Phillies seem on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Mulholland and Dennis Cook, the left-handers obtained from the San 
Francisco Giants for Bedrosian, had gone six innings or more in 11 or 13 starts 
through Friday, strengthening a beleaguered rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Dykstra, obtained from the New York Mets in the Samuel deal and happy to 
be playing regularly, had scored 20 runs in his 26 games as the leadoff man, 
and Roger McDowell, obtained in the same deal and happy to be employed in 
game-saving situations again, was 1-0 with six saves in 13 appearances, having 
yet to allow an earned run. 
</P>
<P>
Touted Charlie Hayes was brought up to replace Schmidt at third base, and 
General Manager Lee Thomas, who first wanted the Giants' prized prospect, Matt 
Williams, in the Bedrosian deal, now says, "Right now, from what I've seen, I 
probably wouldn't trade Hayes for Matt Williams." 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies still need another starting pitcher and a right-handed power 
hitter to protect Von Hayes in the middle of the lineup, but there is a new 
enthusiasm, and Thomas is hoping his club will play well enough in the second 
half so that free agents will be attracted by the lure of playing for a young 
team on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
"I want people to sit up and take notice of the Phillies before this year's 
out," he said. "I want them to say, 'Look at that ballclub. They have improved. 
It looks like in a year or two, they may be a force to be reckoned with.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners seem to be there, the Phillies just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, losers of 107 games last year and leaders of the American League 
East for 78 days this year, have begun the ultimate test, a 14-game trip to 
Oakland, Minnesota, Kansas City and Boston, where the series with the Red Sox 
begins a stretch of 52 games in 51 days. 
</P>
<P>
The key thing in the Orioles' favor remains an inept division. The New York 
Yankees moved to within four games last week, then fell back, victims of their 
own pathetic pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees have lost 20 games by five runs or more this year. In their last 18 
games through Thursday, the bullpen had a 6.54 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for some pitchers to look in the mirror and see what's going on," 
Manager Dallas Green said. "It's ridiculous. Frustrating. It's demoralizing for 
the team to keep sending pitchers out there who can't get people out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting the runs. We're getting enough offense, but the pitchers are 
taking us right out of the game. Something has got to be done. We can't 
continually send out guys who can't get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Said owner George Steinbrenner: "We're not pitching effectively, and the 
bullpen stinks. It doesn't look like a team that understands it's got to get 
going soon or it'll be all over." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees did something about it Saturday, trading third baseman Mike 
Pagliarulo and minor league pitcher Don Schulze to the San Diego Padres for 
pitcher Walt Terrell. Terrell, 31, was 5-13 with a 4.01 earned-run average in 
19 starts for the Padres this year after being acquired from the Detroit Tigers 
at the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
As Dwight Gooden rehabilitates a shoulder injury, nephew Gary Sheffield may 
face a tougher adjustment, healing his wounded pride. 
</P>
<P>
The Milwaukee Brewers sent their prized shortstop and one of baseball's most 
touted rookies to triple-A Denver last week. Sheffield hit .248 in 81 games. He 
had 29 runs batted in and four homers, none since May 3. He had only one hit in 
his last 21 at-bats and five in his last 43. 
</P>
<P>
He also made 12 errors and, of even more concern to the Brewers, seemed to see 
shadows where there weren't any. 
</P>
<P>
It started when Sheffield accused Milwaukee pitchers of being babies for 
failing to protect their hitters. He also seemed to think another rookie 
shortstop, Billy Speiers, was receiving preferential treatment, that he had 
been made an outcast by the coaching staff and that he couldn't relate to 
Manager Tom Trebelhorn, one of baseball's most communicative managers. 
</P>
<P>
"They set the standard too high for me," Sheffield said when sent out. "I 
didn't think I played that badly." 
</P>
<P>
Said Trebelhorn: "He was putting pressure on himself. He has the tools and 
ability to play at the big league level, but he wasn't hitting or playing like 
a big league player. I didn't think this would ever happen." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Leary went from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, Zane Smith from Atlanta to 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Whitey Herzog said he pursued both for his St. Louis Cardinals, but didn't like 
the price. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been interested in Tim Leary, but not for Willie McGee," Herzog 
said. "I would have been interested in Zane Smith, but not for Willie McGee." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there didn't seem to be anything wrong with the Cardinals' 
oft-injured pitching during last week's four-game series against the Dodgers, 
who scored a total of eight runs, but Herzog said: 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, everybody pitches well against the Dodgers. You can't judge 
your pitching against the Dodgers. Those guys can't hit." 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal shortstop Ozzie Smith was a teammate of Dodger first baseman Eddie 
Murray at Locke High in Los Angeles and remains loyal to Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll do better as the team does better," Smith said, assuming it will. "You 
know, Eddie's not the only one over there hitting .240. Everything's falling on 
him, but he's not a one-man team. He's not Bo Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: The acquisition of Kal Daniels leaves the Dodgers in double jeopardy. 
Not only is there a question about the durability of Daniels' knees, but what 
about Kirk Gibson's tender legs now that the Dodgers have made the commitment 
to play him in center field during the final 1 1/2 years of his contract? 
</P>
<P>
Also, how heavy a price will the Dodgers pay for Gibson's inability to throw 
from a more demanding position. Daniels is 25. It is too soon to write off his 
potential, but the more sensible acquisition would have been a bona fide center 
fielder. 
</P>
<P>
With the evidence indicating that court delays will allow Pete Rose to survive 
the season, a new candidate being rumored to replace Rose as the Cincinnati Red 
manager in 1990 is ex- pitcher Jim Kaat, who is also expected to be offered a 
position with CBS next season. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Reds' rumors, Kaat alluded to the salary and said, "I don't think they 
could stack it high enough to make it attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Rose exhibited wise discretion in opting to miss today's Hall of Fame induction 
of former teammate Johnny Bench and the Monday exhibition game between the Reds 
and Boston Red Sox at Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no sense taking the circus to Cooperstown," Rose said, alluding to the 
media certain to descend on him there. 
</P>
<P>
Bench agreed. "They can do whatever they want, but don't mess around with my 
weekend," he said, adding that Rose's demeanor during the investigation into 
his alleged gambling activity "reminds me of the Joker. He's been able to laugh 
through all this." 
</P>
<P>
First, Tom Seaver pricked Rickey Henderson's pride by suggesting that Luis 
Polonia, his successor with the Yankees, has a better arm. Then, Polonia was 
quoted in USA Today saying he will make New York fans forget Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
"Luis Polonia will make people forget about me?" Henderson responded 
incredulously. "I'm a legend. People aren't going to forget about me. I mean, 
when people forget about me, baseball is over. I rewrote the book." 
</P>
<P>
Tom (Flash) Gordon recorded 263 minor-league strikeouts in 1988. He joined the 
Kansas City Royals' bullpen this year with a curveball thought to be the best 
since the arrival of Bert Blyleven. And he went 10-2 over the first half, 
picking up five of his wins after blowing six of seven save opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Moved to the rotation for the second half, Gordon struck out 10 in eight 
innings of his first start Monday, a 3-2 victory over Milwaukee. Now he has the 
Royals envisioning what would probably be a major league first -- a 20-win 
season in two different roles. 
</P>
<P>
"I have dreams of an amazing year for Tom Gordon," Royal Manager John Wathan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it's a shoe-in, but he can win 10 games in relief in the first 
half and 10 as a starter in the second. I don't think it's ever happened, but 
it's a strong possibility the way he's pitching."

TENNIS / THOMAS BONK; 
</P>
<P>
AT 17, FERNANDEZ BEGINS NEW CHAPTER IN HER CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Bonk 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her lessons have moved from the classroom to the tennis court for good now, 
which means Mary Joe Fernandez is going to be missed at her desk when she's at 
the baseline instead. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll ever laugh in history class again," said Marilupe Ortiz, 
17. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes when Ortiz glanced up from her book, she would see Fernandez making 
faces at her through a window from the hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I laughed so hard I cried," she said. "I thought I was going to have to swim 
out of class." 
</P>
<P>
High school missed Fernandez, too, last month when her 48-girl senior class in 
Miami held its graduation ceremony and Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremonies at Carrollton School for the Sacred Heart went on without 
Fernandez because she was not in town. Instead, Fernandez, 17, was in Paris 
playing the semifinals of the French Open, so Sylvia Fernandez accepted her 
daughter's diploma as well as a bouquet of roses. 
</P>
<P>
"There are few like her," Sylvia Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
After reaching the semifinals in Paris, where she lost to eventual champion 
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, and the fourth round at Wimbledon, Fernandez seems to 
have moved into tennis' graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez brings her new No. 14 ranking to the $300,000 Virginia Slims of Los 
Angeles, where Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert and Gabriela Sabatini are 
already at the head of the class. Monica Seles, 15, and Pam Shriver, 27, are 
also entered in the event, which will be played Aug. 7-13 at Manhattan Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
In the time since Fernandez turned pro, six months after her 14th birthday, she 
has always played part-time while going to school. But now that she has 
graduated, Fernandez will play the tour full-time, even though that doesn't 
mean she has stopped thinking about high school. 
</P>
<P>
Carrollton is small enough that its students are a close-knit bunch, and 
Fernandez is learning to associate playing tournaments with opportunities to 
visit former classmates. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, she can visit Catherine Dillon, who will be enrolled at Boston 
College. Michelle Medina will be at Stanford and there is a tournament in 
Oakland. Another friend is going to be at Emory in Atlanta, and Ortiz plans to 
attend Northwestern, when she graduates from Carrollton. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez was an A student even though she could miss two months at a time 
because of her tennis. Looking at it a different way, Fernandez managed to 
improve her tennis even though she might have been distracted by schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm relieved that doing both is over," she said. "It takes a lot of 
pressure off me. Now, I'll just have one thing to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
Her young career already features a turning point -- her semifinal appearance 
at the French Open. Even though Fernandez's greatest moment came on the clay 
courts of Roland Garros, she still considers herself capable of similar results 
on hard or fast courts. 
</P>
<P>
"The French obviously showed I can compete with anyone out there," she said. "I 
was two matches away from winning it, which is nothing. My goal is to win any 
Grand Slam (event). I won't be picky. Wimbledon?" 
</P>
<P>
And although her career is only now beginning in earnest, Fernandez is already 
thinking about when it may end. Evert told her that when she was 17, she 
thought she would quit at 25. That was nine years ago. Fernandez can't see 
herself playing beyond 27 or 28 and said she may even quit sooner than that. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be a young grandmother," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Memo to the USTA: So just how popular with the players is your U.S. Open? Not 
very, apparently. 
</P>
<P>
According to a survey in the Tennis magazine of France, 89 of the top men and 
women professionals did not rate the U.S. Open highly when comparing it to the 
other three Grand Slam events -- the Australian Open, the French Open and 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Open was rated last in the category of best organization, last in best 
audience, last in players' facilities, last in transportation, last in most 
beautiful stadium, last in best welcome, last in food, last in trophy ceremony 
and last in scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
Players surveyed included John McEnroe, Mats Wilander, Ivan Lendl, Stefan 
Edberg, Yannick Noah, Pam Shriver, Helena Sukova and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. 
</P>
<P>
Their sentiments and those of the other players can't be considered much of a 
surprise anymore. Last, maybe, but certainly not least, the U.S. Open at 
Flushing Meadow is a great championship that seems to be viewed in an 
increasing disagreeable light. 
</P>
<P>
One thing players at the U.S. Open can't complain about is the money. The men's 
and women's singles champions will receive a record $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
First-round losers in qualifying will receive $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The total purse this year will be a record $5,124,000. This is the first time 
the U.S. Open prize money has exceeded $5 million and it's 17% more than last 
year's total of $4,371,500. 
</P>
<P>
Today's question: Does anyone in the men's top 10 play without a racket 
contract? The answer is that four of them do: No. 2 Boris Becker, No. 3 Stefan 
Edberg, No. 4 Mats Wilander and No. 5 John McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
Becker must be enjoying the price of success. His deep pockets may be filling 
up rapidly. After winning his third Wimbledon title, Becker is expected to be 
worth an estimated $7.5 million off the court. 
</P>
<P>
Becker is negotiating a $2.5-million endorsement with a West German dairy. He 
already has million-dollar contracts with four companies, and his appearance 
fee for exhibitions is $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wunderbar: Wimbledon champion Steffi Graf and the entire West German Federation 
Cup team will play in the Great American Bank Tennis Tournament, July 31-Aug. 6 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, who is making her only West Coast tournament appearance, is going to have 
plenty of familiar company with the team that won the Federation Cup in 1987: 
Sylvia Hanika, Claudia Kohde-Kilsch and Claudia Porwik. 
</P>
<P>
Also entered are Wimbledon quarterfinalists Gretchen Magers and Rosalyn 
Fairbank, who both live in San Diego, and Pam Shriver and Lori McNeil.

Zina Garrison and Pam Shriver, gold-medal winners in the doubles at last year's 
Olympic Games, will face each other in today's final of the Hall of Fame 
Championships at Newport, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver, seeded second, needed a third-set tiebreaker to defeat Ros Fairbank, 
3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), Saturday. The top-seeded Garrison defeated No. 8 Gigi 
Fernandez, 6-4, 6-3, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver, ranked 10th in the world, hit two backhand volleys for winners in the 
tiebreaker and then played the winning point exactly as she had planned. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one play in mind," she said. "I wanted to have a nice chip backhand and 
follow it, make her hit a volley. It worked to perfection." 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank netted Shriver's chip shot to lose her fourth semifinal singles match 
at Newport. 
</P>
<P>
The South African native, ranked 30th, had three match points in the second 
set. Fairbank netted two returns, and Shriver made a passing shot to stave off 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"She came up with the shots when she needed them," Fairbank said. "I played 
well, I was selecting the right shots, but I was not executing them." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Davis upset No. 1-seeded Dan Goldie, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, in the semifinals of 
the $200,000 OTB International tennis tournament at Schenectady, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, seeded fourth, will face Simon Youl of Tasmania in today's final. Youl 
defeated Glenn Michibata of Canada, 3-6, 7-6, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Goldie dominated the first set against Davis, using his serve-and-volley game 
to keep him off balance. But Davis rallied in the next two sets.

Stefan Edberg and Anders Jarryd were upset in Saturday's doubles, but Sweden 
retained its lead over Yugoslavia in a Davis Cup semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg and Jarryd, once one of the world's best doubles team but now playing 
together only in team competition, lost, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 to Goran Ivanisevic 
and Goran Prpic. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden leads, 2-1, going into today's final two singles matches. 
</P>
<P>
Jonas Svensson and Mats Wilander had won the opening singles matches Friday. 
Sweden has never lost a Davis Cup match after leading, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Svensson will play Prpic in the first singles match today, and Wilander will 
complete the best-of-five series against Ivanisevic, a teen-ager who has jumped 
to 51st in the rankings this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavs were playing only their fourth doubles match together. 
Ivanisevic, who played two other doubles with Prpic in the Kings Cup, a 
European team event, and one in the Nations' Cup, was outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough match because we have played so little together," Ivanisevic 
said. "We played really good. It was impossible to beat us. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, a finalist in both the French Open and Wimbledon, was replaced as 
singles player by Svensson because of an ankle injury. He had not played 
competitively since Wimbledon. He sprained his ankle last weekend in his 
hometown of Vastervik during his first workout on clay since Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been surprised if I had played well today," Edberg said. "Anders 
had only one handicap and that was me."

THE GEISHA WHO JOLTED JAPAN'S NUMERO UNO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL BLUSTEIN, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former geisha who has virtually wrecked the political career of Prime 
Minister Sosuke Uno smiles and bows demurely. "My name," she says, "is Mitsuko 
Nakanishi." 
</P>
<P>
Nakanishi is wearing a white dress patterned with red flowers, clasped at the 
neck with a pearl pin. Forty years old, she possesses a delicate beauty, and it 
is not hard to imagine how Uno would have found her irresistibly alluring in 
the fall of 1985 when, by her account, they embarked on a five-month affair 
during which he paid her a total of about $21,000. 
</P>
<P>
Now, thanks to her revelations about that relationship in a Japanese magazine, 
Nakanishi stands as the unlikely symbol of a budding feminist insurgency that 
is turning the political and social worlds here topsy-turvy. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal, coming at a time when the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is 
reeling from a series of other problems amid a national election campaign, has 
helped put the LDP in danger of losing its 34-year grip on Japanese politics. 
It has pushed the 66-year-old prime minister to the brink of resignation only 
six weeks after taking office. And the whole episode -- much like that 
involving Gary Hart in the United States -- has engendered a sort of gigantic 
national consciousness-raising, in which old norms of behavior are being 
questioned and broader issues about women's rights brought to the fore. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bundle of Contradictions 
</P>
<P>
The woman who touched off this furor is, to say the least, a bundle of 
contradictions. On the one hand, Nakanishi manifests deep anger over what she 
says was Uno's callous disrespect toward her, and she laments that the status 
of Japanese women lags far behind that of their Western sisters. 
</P>
<P>
In a soft voice laced with indignation, Nakanishi says she "can't understand" 
Japanese women who send their husbands off on sex tours of Korea and Southeast 
Asia, inwardly hating the situation while at the same time fulfilling a wifely 
obligation by "putting condoms in the husband's luggage." On the issue of 
women's rights, she adds, "I wish foreign countries would bash Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all her feminist sentiments, Nakanishi concedes that the geisha world, 
which she joined in her mid-30s, epitomizes the subservient role that women 
tend to play in Japan's male-dominated society. The fact that she took the 
geisha life style to its logical extreme, becoming the paid mistress of a 
powerful man, vitiates her legitimacy as a social critic, in the view of many 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Among her sterner detractors are women. Kazuko Komiri, a salty 79-year-old film 
critic and television personality, was quoted in a magazine saying of 
Nakanishi: "She sold her body for 300,000 yen a month, and then revealed it 
because her partner became famous. Such a woman is shameless." 
</P>
<P>
Partly because she is upset with the Japanese media for printing such attacks 
on her, and partly because she believes that image-conscious Japan will change 
only under pressure from abroad, Nakanishi granted a recent interview to the 
Washington Post and a separate interview to Britain's Daily Telegraph. She 
spoke mostly in Japanese, occasionally interjecting an English sentence or two. 
</P>
<P>
She had previously been interviewed only by Sunday Mainichi, a respected 
magazine that broke the story early last month, and by the Japanese network 
TBS, which broadcast two shows giving Japan its first real look at her. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest of nine children, Nakanishi became a geisha in an unconventional 
way: She had first married, borne a child, divorced her husband, gotten an 
office job -- and only then entered the exotic world of "flower and willow." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temptations Obvious 
</P>
<P>
Geisha traditionally are trained from girlhood, so that they can be properly 
schooled in the art of pampering and entertaining male clients. They learn the 
samisen, a guitar-like instrument, and traditional Japanese singing (utai) and 
dance. Although a geisha's relationship with a client doesn't always lead to 
sex, the temptations are obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"Geisha are supposed to be sexy where wives are sober, artistic where wives are 
humdrum, and witty where wives are serious," according to the book, "Geisha," 
by Liza Dalby, an American anthropologist who studied the geisha subculture by 
becoming one herself. 
</P>
<P>
Nakanishi says her main reason for becoming a geisha was simply to make more 
money. 
</P>
<P>
She figured she could rake in several times the $900 monthly she had been 
earning as an "office lady" in a law firm. "My ex-husband had remarried and he 
wanted to raise my child," she says. "So I made up my mind to get up and do 
something." Working as a geisha also appealed to her, she says, because she had 
studied the samisen and utai in her youth, and she liked the idea of deepening 
her appreciation of those traditional arts. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether it felt peculiar to adopt the servility required of a geisha, she 
replies, "Yes. But I made up my mind that this was business." Whatever sense of 
contradiction she felt with her modern instincts, she says, "I made up my mind 
to just cut it from my thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
Only a month or so after she became a geisha in mid-1985, she says, Uno -- then 
a prominent member of Parliament -- noticed her and arranged to meet her a few 
days later at a ryotei, an exclusive Japanese restaurant where geisha typically 
provide their services. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely what happened between Uno and Nakanishi is obviously subject to 
doubt, especially since her veracity has recently come under a bit of a cloud. 
A Tokyo mass-circulation magazine published allegations -- based on anonymous 
sources, and vigorously denied by Nakanishi -- that she has lied in the past 
about her educational and artistic attainments. 
</P>
<P>
But the basic elements of her story are widely regarded as credible because of 
the corroboration of the okaasan, or mother, of her geisha house, who told 
Sunday Mainichi: "I understand a bit why she wanted to speak out. But a real 
geisha never talks." (Uno has refused to discuss either her story or similar 
stories that have emerged recently about his relationships with other women.) 
</P>
<P>
Nakanishi has recalled that when she and Uno sat together in a private tatami 
room at their first dinner in October, 1985, Uno sought to impress her by 
showing her the about-the-author page of a history book he had written, which 
said he had 
</P>
<P>
served in a variety of posts, including minister of international trade and 
industry. Uno sang a few songs to relax her, but he eventually got down to 
business rather crudely, she says, advancing his offer of 300,000 yen per month 
by grabbing three of her fingers and demanding gruffly, "How about this?" 
</P>
<P>
She decided to accept his proposal to provide sex or social accompaniment 
whenever he called because, she told TBS, "in the geisha world it's hard to say 
no," and because "I had just gotten divorced and I was not confident of 
myself." But when he commanded her to "lie down" right there on the straw 
tatami mat, she refused, she says. 
</P>
<P>
They first had sex in late December, according to Nakanishi, who says Uno 
spoiled the occasion by harping on the fact that he was paying her, even though 
the sums he allegedly disbursed are widely regarded here as meager by geisha 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sex With a Geisha 
</P>
<P>
"Sleeping with a geisha is not to be undertaken lightly," Dalby writes in her 
book. A man "will not be able to extricate himself easily if his passion cools. 
. . . (Men who avail themselves of geisha services) know that if the intimacy 
should sour, reproachful eyes will ruin relaxation at their favorite teahouses. 
Men who do take a geisha mistress must be prepared for everything that the 
relationship entails, and they are expected to show their patronage by 
continuous magnanimous gifts." 
</P>
<P>
In some respects, Nakanishi seems to have lost her perspective about what she 
should have expected from such an arrangement. For example, she recalls rushing 
to the bathroom in tears after receiving a phone call canceling an assignation 
with Uno because his wife had come to Tokyo from his parliamentary district. 
</P>
<P>
But her descriptions of Uno, which she imparts with a certain emotional 
intensity, suggest that his behavior fell considerably short of the sensitive 
Alan Alda type. She recalls, for example, that at a small New Year's occasion, 
Uno humiliated her by gesturing derisively when he was asked by an older geisha 
if it was true that he and Nakanishi were carrying on a special relationship. 
Later, when the okaasan of her geisha house sought to entertain Uno by 
performing a special dance for him, the future prime minister made little 
attempt to disguise his scorn for the old woman's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
According to Nakanishi, Uno would typically call her early in the morning -- 
even though she worked late at night -- to boast about his coverage in the 
newspapers and television. He promised her gifts, she says, but didn't come 
through. He didn't even provide a traditional parting gift when he broke off 
their affair in March, 1986, she says; he merely claimed that he was subject to 
a dokuta-stoppu ("doctor-stop," or medical order) to refrain from sex. 
</P>
<P>
Nakanishi has consistently maintained that it wasn't her wounded pride that 
prompted her to go public with her accusations against Uno. She says she 
believes that a man who treats women so shabbily shouldn't be allowed to lead a 
nation. Uno's behavior "goes to the fundamental question of relations between 
human beings," she declares. 
</P>
<P>
When Uno was elevated from foreign minister to prime minister early last month, 
"everything which I had shut down inside myself suddenly burst," she says. 
Although she says she dreaded the idea of becoming the center of a scandal, she 
felt compelled "to cut my flesh, and bleed myself" -- figuratively speaking, of 
course -- "and by doing so, cut his bones." 
</P>
<P>
Nakanishi's tale has evoked a wide array of reactions. The Japanese public has 
long turned a blind eye toward the extramarital activities of politicians, and 
one oft-expressed opinion here is that Uno's main sin was not having a 
mistress, but rather failing to bestow the proper kindnesses. Holders of this 
view like to cite the late Bukichi Miki, a founder of the Liberal Democratic 
Party, who reputedly rebuffed a heckler by acknowledging that, yes, he had 
several mistresses, "but I take good care of all of them." 
</P>
<P>
Among those taking a less-than-harsh view -- at least in public -- is Uno's 
wife, Chiyo, who in true Lee Hart fashion was quoted in a magazine as saying 
that she continues to trust her husband, and "anyway this is a story of the 
past." She also apologized on Uno's behalf because "such trouble was caused" by 
the uproar. Some Japanese dismiss the whole subject as unfit for public 
discussion, asserting -- as did one LDP politician in a television interview -- 
that "what's below the navel isn't personal character." 
</P>
<P>
But others say it is high time that Japanese politicians were held to a higher 
ethical standard, particularly in the wake of an influence-peddling scandal 
that led to the resignations of Uno's predecessor Noboru Takeshita and several 
Cabinet members earlier this year. Women's groups have picketed Uno's public 
appearances, demanding that he step down. And the prestigious Asahi Journal 
declared that the lesson to be learned is that Japan, having become an economic 
superpower, should adopt a more modern code of behavior. Asahi quoted the 
Confucian adage: "After satisfying the need for clothing and the need for food, 
one should behave according to morality and politeness." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notoriety Brings Misery 
</P>
<P>
Nakanishi may try to cash in on the controversy by writing a book, but in the 
meantime her notoriety has brought her mostly misery. No longer a geisha -- she 
quit well before the scandal broke and took an office job with a design firm -- 
she has been unable to work because "the yellow papers (tabloids and 
mass-circulation magazines) are constantly chasing me." 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, she has gone into seclusion, undergoing Buddhist purification 
rites and trying to figure out what to do with her life. Leaning forward and 
putting her hand on her bosom, she says touchingly in English, "My heart, 
broken." Aha. Perhaps, then, this is really a story about unrequited love? "No, 
no, no, no," she retorts, again in English; she wasn't in love with Uno. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many things that happened, one after the other," that angered 
her about Uno, she says, that she reached the point where she felt the urge to 
simply "give back the money and say goodby." 
</P>
<P>
But didn't she want Uno to love her? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," she replies, "I am a woman. Such feelings are natural, I think."

RECORD RACK: GLORIA ESTEFAN "CUTS BOTH WAYS." EPIC : ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A 
SCALE OF ONE (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC) 
</P>

Just the idea of Latin pop music conjures up something succulent and slightly 
subversive -- something with a bit more of an edge than pop sounds of the 
all-American persuasion. But Estefan -- who has become one of the biggest 
popularizers of the genre as the front-woman of the Miami Sound Machine -- 
writes the kind of mild, easily digestible Latin pop that could be considered 
hot stuff only to those who regard Ricky Ricardo as a hell raiser. 
</P>
<P>
Estefan is essentially as wholesome as Anne Murray with a dollop of salsa on 
the side. And, while that may be a good and pleasant thing to be, it doesn't 
exactly make for the most exciting music in the world. Still backed by the 
Miami Sound Machine, though now with solo billing, Estefan sings what sound 
like advertising jingles designed to sell you on the notion of a kinder, 
gentler salsa. 
</P>
<P>
She does work up some steam on "Oye Mi Canto" (the Spanish version of the song 
on the cassette and CD comes across better), but it's on "Ai, Ai, I" that she 
reveals her soul instincts. Estefan fares best on the title cut, a wistful 
ballad in which she sounds like a cross between Murray and Karen Carpenter. 
There's really nothing wrong with Estefan and her warmly focused, direct music 
-- nothing that a swerve off of that safe, middle-of-the-road course couldn't 
solve. CONNIE JOHNSON

THE BEASTIE BOYS "PAUL'S BOUTIQUE." CAPITOL *** 1/2 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rap is what you hear pounding from boom boxes. Metal is what you hear blasting 
from '74 Camaros. The first Beastie Boys LP, "Licensed to Ill," was essentially 
an awesome metal-rap hybrid -- Run-DMC wrote some of the rhymes, a guy from 
Slayer played some of the guitar. The album didn't cross over as much as it 
appealed to two distinct audiences: KDAY and KROQ both played the heck out of 
it, although each station played different cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Though the hard-core aesthetics are similar, metal basically serves the 
function for white teen-agers (KROQ) that rap does for black ones (KDAY), which 
is why you never saw the surge in white rap so many people predicted after 
"Ill" went to No. 1. The would-be Big Daddy Kanes turned out mostly to be 
would-be Metallicas. 
</P>
<P>
"Ill" was produced by Rick Rubin, who more or less invented the rap-metal 
thing. "Paul's Boutique," the new one, was produced by the Hollywood dance-club 
phenoms called the Dust Brothers, roughly the team who gave Tone Loc's beats 
their distinctive, shuffling sound. The low-tech amalgam of sly '70s soul here 
is funky as can be. 
</P>
<P>
The bratty Beasties from "Ill" still aren't what you'd call redemptive -- on 
this one, they rap about egg fights, impersonate various armed drifters and 
feature that thingamajig that moos like a cow when you turn it over -- but when 
they go into the Dead End Kid riff, it at least sounds like self-parody now, 
and they've resumed the use of their real names. (Horovitz isn't the easiest 
name to rhyme, but they manage.) The rhymes are strong and clean and funny:

RECORD RACK: LL COOL J "WALKING WITH A PANTHER." DEF JAM/COLUMBIA ** 1/2: 
ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE (POOR) TO FIVE ( A CLASSIC) STARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cool J established himself as the meanest-talking rapper around with his early 
hits "You'll Rock" and "Rock the Bells," devouring the competition with 
ruthless insults and non-stop bragging thrown wildly over hard hip-hop dance 
beats. So a lot of fans were surprised when he released the rap ballad "I Need 
Love," a 1987 hit that showed a softer side of LL. 
</P>
<P>
On "Walking With a Panther," Cool J is again marching to his own bad beat, 
mixing his trademark hard-edged tirades with several reprises of the rap ballad 
format. "I'm That Type of Guy," the first single, is a smoothly grooving boast 
that finds the "ladies lover" in firm control of the females. "Why Do You Think 
They Call It Dope" is a rough and rugged up-tempo jam whose rage and rhythm are 
rivaled only by radical rhymers Public Enemy. "Jingling Baby" is a wild and 
frantic dance jam laced with manic fast-paced rhyming. 
</P>
<P>
The album's three love songs come off sounding lame at best, even embarrassing, 
and "Clap Your Hands" includes some inexcusably adolescent sexual references. 
But with the exception of these minor indiscretions, the album re-establishes 
Cool J as rap's hardest one-man band. 
</P>
<P>
Boasting has always been LL Cool J's shtick, but here he sinks under the weight 
of his own ego. He's barely altered the style he's relied on for years, and the 
formula shows signs of strain. The New York hip-hop scene is moving ahead 
rapidly, adding new and broader motifs of social consciousness and 
responsibility. That's a development that leaves "Walking With a Panther" 
sounding a little out of step with the times. Duff Marlowe

INTRODUCING: ATLANTA'S MARY MY HOPE: 'OPTIMISTIC NIHILISM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE

<TEXT>
<P>
Band: Mary My Hope Personnel: Clinton Steele, guitar; James Hall, vocals, 
guitar; Sven Pipien, bass; Steven Lindenbaum, drums. 
</P>
<P>
History: Steele hooked up with German-born Pipien in Atlanta two years ago. 
After dropping out of college to concentrate on music, the duo recruited Hall 
and found Lindenbaum through an ad begging release from heavy-metal monotony. 
Taking its name from a religious tract, Mary My Hope made a distinctive mark in 
the Atlanta scene, eventually drawing the attention of Andrew Lauder, the 
former head of England's Demon Records (who originally signed Elvis Costello). 
Lauder signed the group to his new, RCA-distributed Silvertone label. M.M.H. 
recorded its debut album, "Museum," in Wales with producer Hugh Jones (Echo 
&amp; the Bunnymen). The band recently toured America with Jane's Addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Sound: Taking the stairway to arena rock heaven, Mary My Hope is a true acolyte 
of rock mythology; its more thundering moments reveal the fall-out of 
devotional hours spent listening to the Doors, Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, 
AC/DC, David Bowie, Pink Floyd and even INXS. These might be diverse-style 
icons, but Mary My Hope has no problem with stylistic purity. Though capable of 
blistering, straight-ahead rockers ("Hourglass"), the group has a predilection 
toward epic drama-songs such as the band's signature, "Suicide King," which 
rises from a plaintive acoustic opening to a sonic meltdown, complete with 
crashing walls of chords and Hall's Robert Plant-like wailing. Thematically the 
group runs the gamut of what Steele describes as "optimistic nihilism," with 
lots of crypto-mystical musings about spiritual salvation and death. Still 
young and naive enough (the oldest band member is 23) to trim the fat off 
dinosaur art-rock leftovers, Mary My Hope stands poised between metallic 
rapture and an unholy mess.

LE CELLIER TO SERVE ITS LAST MEALS JULY 31 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dependable, traditionally French Le Cellier in Santa Monica has been sold, 
and will serve its last dinners on July 31. The restaurant opened almost 20 
years ago -- on the site that had been occupied by Madame Wu's, incidentally, 
until that establishment moved to palatial newer quarters a few blocks to the 
west. Le Cellier owners Madeleine and Jacques Don Salat plan to retire -- "with 
mixed emotions, very frankly," says Madeleine Don Salat. The restaurant's 
longtime chef, Jean Bellordre, she adds, "is being a bit mysterious about his 
plans, but he certainly wants to have at least some months of complete rest." 
</P>
<P>
The new owner of the premises is Carmine Inc., a company owned in part by 
Carmine Competelli, Jr. -- whose family ran the veteran West L.A. Italian 
restaurant called Carmine's for several decades, before selling it last year. 
(It remains open under the Carmine's name, but is no longer affiliated with the 
original proprietors in any way.) Competelli plans to remodel Le Cellier 
slightly and reopen it by mid-September as Menello di Carmine. The food, he 
says, will be Continental/Italian -- but he adds that "my thing has always been 
that I'll make anything anybody likes. If somebody wants a French 
bouillabaisse, I can make that. Italian's my specialty, but I'm also a great 
steak cook, and I can make a terrific hamburger." 
</P>
<P>
Competelli's partners in the new enterprise are businessmen Matthew Smith and 
Gerald Goldman and former Carmine's maitre d' Eddie De Bellagente. Madeleine 
and Jacques Don Salat retain a small interest in the place, and additional 
minority shares are held by 30 or so additional investors -- including 
Hollywood celebrities Tony Danza and Kim Basinger. 
</P>
<P>
PYRAMID SCHEME: Under its original proprietor, Fernand Point, La Pyramide in 
Vienne, south of Lyon, became arguably the best and most influential single 
restaurant in France. Among the chefs who learned their trade there were Paul 
Bocuse, Alain Chapel and Louis Outhier. Thus, it was almost literally the 
birthplace of the nouvelle cuisine, and by extension of all the cooking styles 
that stemmed from it -- the "New American Cuisine" among them. Following 
Point's death in 1956, his widow, Mado, continued to run the place in something 
of an ossified fashion, as a slowly fading monument to his greatness. She died 
two years ago, and her family closed the restaurant. Now it has reopened under 
the ownership of a Paris-based development company called Le Foncier des Champs 
Elysees, with its dining room remodeled and expanded and a few guest rooms 
added. The new proprietors are 31-year-old chef Patrick Henriroux and his wife, 
Pascale. The food world waits and watches. 
</P>
<P>
THE VERY THINGS THAT HAPPEN: The Seventh Street Bistro, downtown, holds its 
first wine maker's dinner tomorrow night at 7 p.m., featuring the wares of 
Rutherford Hill Winery. The six-course meal costs $75 per person, with tax, tip 
and even valet parking fee included. . . . The Mandarin in Beverly Hills, in 
association with the L.A. chapter of the American Institute of Wine &amp; Food, 
offers a special luncheon next Sunday called "The Daily Foods of China." The 
restaurant will be divided into a series of food stalls, each serving samples 
of authentic regional Chinese street food. Call (213) 473-5324 for details. Lew 
Mitchell's Orient Express on the Miracle Mile matches the wines of Adler-Fels 
with a special Chinese-French-style menu, July 31. Cost of the seven-course 
meal is $50 per person. . . . And photographer/painter Paul Child, whose wife 
is Julia, will be honored at a special exhibition of his work Aug. 6 from 4 to 
7 p.m. at the Santa Barbara Winery in Santa Barbara. The winery's own wines 
will be served with food selected by Mrs. Child -- and tours of three nearby 
food businesses will be available. The event is sponsored by the Southern 
California Culinary Guild. Tickets are $25 apiece, and reservations must be 
made by July 30. Call Laila Rashid at (805) 963-3633. 
</P>
<P>
And Yamashiro in Hollywood hosts "The Keith and Margo Murder Mystery," a 
combination prix fixe dinner and audience-participation drama, Aug. 4, 12 and 
18, with later dates to be announced. Cost is $65 per person, and reservations 
are essential.

GROWERS REAP BENEFITS OF SWITCH TO ORGANIC FARMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

DELANO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Cantisano is an organic farmer with a pony tail that reaches the small of 
his back. Everyone calls him Amigo Bob. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Pandol Sr. is an agribusinessman with thousands of acres of San Joaquin 
Valley farmland and an export operation that sells fruits and vegetables to 
more than 40 countries. He is a prominent Kern County Republican. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the two men had little respect for each other's methods of 
farming. But today conventional farmers, spurred by increasing consumer concern 
about pesticides, are devoting acreage to organic agriculture. And organic 
farmers are discovering that large growers are interested in learning their 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Pandol Brothers Inc. planted 120 acres of organic table grapes and 
wanted to learn the best methods to fight plant pests and disease without using 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
So Jack Pandol hired Amigo Bob as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout California, the state's largest industrial farms are beginning to 
grow some fruits and vegetables without synthetic chemicals. In the Coachella 
Valley, Sunkist Growers Inc. has devoted 40 acres to organic lemons. In the 
Salinas Valley, the Nunes Company, one of the largest lettuce growers in the 
country, will harvest 45 acres of organic iceberg lettuce next month. In 
Bakersfield, Superior Farms, the largest grape and tree fruit growers in the 
nation, is farming 400 acres of organic grapes. 
</P>
<P>
For the large growers, the acreage devoted to organic crops still is relatively 
small. But, Pandol said, growers will expand their organic operations if the 
market for pesticide-free produce continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think organics were for the hippie grower with a few acres," Pandol 
said. "But, lately, more and more people want to buy organic fruit. Some of the 
large growers saw that trend and responded to it. If the demand for organics is 
there, we'll provide the product. If the demand doubles, we'll double our 
acreage." 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF), a trade 
association for alternative agriculture, had no large growers among its 
members. Today, more than 150 of its members are conventional farmers who have 
set aside a portion of their acreage for a variety of organic fruits or 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Interest among growers has steadily increased during the last year and a half, 
said Bob Scowcroft, executive director of CCOF, based in Santa Cruz. And the 
extensive publicity last February about apples being sprayed with the growth 
regulator Alar "broke a kind of barrier," Scowcroft said, and created a boom 
market for all organic products. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Major Players' Interested 
</P>
<P>
"In the last six months, we've received calls from most of the major players in 
California agriculture," Scowcroft said. "Organic agriculture has definitely 
hit the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, organic produce was only available in neighborhood natural food 
stores. But now a number of large California supermarket chains, including 
Ralphs, Vons and Raley's, offer organic fruits and vegetables in their produce 
sections. Last year, Lucky Food Centers began selling organic produce in a 
handful of its markets. The program was so successful it spread to more than 
150 Lucky stores in Northern California, and recently the program was expanded 
to about 50 Southern California markets. 
</P>
<P>
"When organic growing was more of a back yard venture, the supply just wasn't 
there for the large markets," said Charles Collings, president of Raley's Inc., 
which operates 58 supermarkets in Northern California. "But now that the big 
growers have moved into organics, we're assured of a large enough supply to 
make it worth our while." 
</P>
<P>
As the market for organic foods continues to grow, and prices stay higher than 
conventionally grown products, the danger of fraud increases. According to a 
U.S. Department of Agriculture report: "Organic farming is a production system 
which avoids the use of synthetically compounded fertilizers, pesticides, 
growth regulators," and relies on non-chemical methods to control insects and 
weeds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carrot Packing 
</P>
<P>
Last year the CCOF discovered a San Diego vegetable packing business that was 
purchasing carrots grown in Mexico with pesticides and then selling them under 
an organic label. After an investigation by the state Department of Health 
Services, the vegetable packers went out of business. 
</P>
<P>
The CCOF conducts regular inspections of its members' farms but, Scowcroft 
said, more extensive state regulation is needed. State legislation recently was 
proposed by the CCOF requiring regular field inspections by state officials, 
more thorough documentation by organic growers and stronger enforcement 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
When Jack Pandol and his partners decided to plant 120 acres of organic grapes 
last January, some neighboring farmers in Kern County were resentful. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought if we stamped some of our grapes as being clean, it would mean 
that theirs were dirty," Pandol said. "They thought it would be a stigma for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
But Pandol said he is a businessman as well as a farmer and, if there is a 
market for organic fruit, he has to take that demand seriously. Pandol also 
hopes to learn more about organic farming so he can apply some of the 
techniques to his conventional crops. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticides are becoming an increasingly larger part of a grower's budget and 
many farmers are trying to reduce their use as a cost-cutting measure. And as 
chemical contamination of ground water and farm worker safety become serious 
concerns, farm communities throughout the country are pushing for reduced 
pesticide use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harvest Next Month 
</P>
<P>
Pandol Brothers, which farms about 4,000 acres of grapes and other fruit, will 
harvest its organic grapes in August. Next year the company plans to add 
another 400 acres of organic grapes, and will set aside acreage for organic 
almonds and kiwis. The Pandols' consultant, Bob Cantisano, has showed them a 
number of alternative agricultural techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"We may come from different political or philosophical backgrounds, but our 
goal is the same: to produce pesticide-free food in a clean environment . . . 
and do it profitably," said Cantisano, who recently sold his small organic farm 
and now works as a consultant to about 40 large growers in California. "More 
and more growers are seeing that it can be done." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of simply spraying their 120 acres of grapes with pesticides, the 
Pandols introduced a number of "beneficial" insects, such as lady bugs and lace 
wings, to gobble up the pests that prey on grapes. Instead of using chemical 
fertilizer, the Pandols spread compost and manure on the fields. They have 
planted cover crops such as buckwheat, cowpea and vetch to raise the nitrogen 
level of the soil and provide a home for insects that feed on destructive pests 
such as Pacific mites. 
</P>
<P>
The Nunes Company in the Salinas Valley uses enormous vacuums to suck bugs off 
their organic lettuce, said David Nunes, head of the farm's research and 
development department. Nunes is also experimenting with non-toxic, 
biodegradable soap compounds and natural bacteria to control aphids, spider 
mites and white flies. And weeds, once eradicated by herbicides, now have to be 
scratched out of the dirt by teams of farm workers armed with hoes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affects Appearance 
</P>
<P>
While grape growers have found that their organic crop is comparable in quality 
and yield to their conventionally grown grapes, lettuce has proved to be more 
difficult to grow without chemicals. There is more "scarring" on the organic 
lettuce as a result of insects, Nunes said, and the yield is lower. It costs 
the Nunes Company about twice as much to cultivate its organic crop. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still experimenting, so we have to be patient," Nunes said. "We don't 
expect to make a profit on our first crop. But eventually we'll lower the cost 
of growing organic, and we hope to get our quality up to the standard of the 
rest of our lettuce." 
</P>
<P>
The farm plans to expand its organic operation next year, Nunes said. It will 
add another 125 acres of organic lettuce and also begin setting aside acreage 
for organic celery and cauliflower. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers have to proceed slowly because there is little data available on 
organic agriculture. It may take years of experimentation, many said, before 
they are able to efficiently harvest large crops of organic food. 
</P>
<P>
Governmental agencies and university agricultural departments have 
traditionally shown little interest in exploring organic agricultural 
techniques, said Joyce Johnston, director of the Kern County Valley Action 
Network, a local environmental group. For example, John R. Block, the Reagan 
Administration's first secretary of agriculture, called organic research a 
"dead end." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Biggest Naysayers' 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the biggest naysayers are the university farm advisers," Johnston 
said. "They've been trained in the chemical school of agriculture for so long 
they refuse to consider any alternatives. There's a real need for scientific 
research on organic growing. But there's very little funding for it, so farmers 
have to learn for themselves by trial and error." 
</P>
<P>
Most alternative agriculture research has been devoted to the reduction of 
pesticide use, rather than the elimination of all synthetic chemicals, said 
Roberta Cook, an agricultural economics professor at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"If we went back to farming without any chemicals, we wouldn't be able to feed 
the world," Cook said. "Large-scale growing of organics is still very new. So 
farm advisers aren't going to be out there advocating these methods until 
they've been proven to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Because it is more expensive for farmers to grow many types of fruits and 
vegetables without using pesticides, organic produce costs an average of 25% 
more that other produce. And some organic produce does not have the flawless 
appearance consumers have become accustomed to. Some shoppers will purchase the 
product anyway, but large growers are still reluctant to convert vast amounts 
of acreage to organics until they are assured that the market will continue to 
expand. 
</P>
<P>
Still, most growers are optimistic about the future of the organic market. 
Recently, frozen food companies, food processors, large fruit juice firms and 
baby food companies have begun selling organic products. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear Competition 
</P>
<P>
The owners of small organic farms have expressed concern that they may soon be 
squeezed out of the market by the industrial farms. But the large growers say 
they are not interested in the traditional markets of the longtime organic 
growers: natural food stores. Growers are interested in mass-producing organic 
produce, they say, and are targeting the chain supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
"For years we've tried to use legislation to get farmers to reduce pesticides, 
but all it did was alienate them," Johnston said. "But when the big stores 
created a market for the organics, the farmers responded. . . . Now when I see 
Amigo Bob with his 3-foot pony tail sitting down with the biggest growers in 
the valley, I know our day has come."

ARMENIA AID GETS BACK TO THE BASICS

YEREVAN, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Swiss Catholic charity Caritas offered to put up temporary housing for 
some of the Armenians left without shelter after the devastating earthquake 
here last year, Soviet officials said they would rather have a factory that 
manufactured water faucets. 
</P>
<P>
"The Swiss were flabbergasted," Yuri S. Mkhitarian, a senior official of the 
Armenian State Building Committee, recalled. "They had a vision in their minds 
of these poor, homeless people being sheltered in prefabricated chalets and 
living happily in a little Swiss village in the hills of northern Armenia. Yet 
here we were talking about plumbing -- pipes and faucets and that sort of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
But the Armenian officials' reasoning was very straightforward: With more than 
520,000 people to rehouse, Armenia needs foreign assistance -- help on a scale 
that vastly exceeds the resources of individual donors, such as Caritas. 
Foreign donors, they say, must consequently shift from prestigious but small 
relief projects to those that speed the broader reconstruction effort here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Urgent Needs 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to build us a hospital, but we need the wherewithal to rebuild 
the whole of the earthquake zone," Mkhitarian said. "We do need dozens of new 
hospitals, clinics and other medical facilities, but the whole Armenian 
population did not take sick after the earthquake. We have other needs, too, 
and they are equally urgent. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need most of all now, in fact, is assistance in re-establishing our 
construction industry, which itself was largely destroyed in the earthquake, 
and assistance in redeveloping our economy. 
</P>
<P>
About $500 million in international aid poured into Armenia from 113 countries 
after the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed more than 25,000 people, officials 
said. But most went into immediate relief work, medical care for the injured 
and the preliminary phase of reconstruction. The total damage in the earthquake 
zone has been estimated by the government at the equivalent of $16 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Situation Remains Grave' 
</P>
<P>
"The acute crisis is over," Mkhitarian said, "but the situation here remains 
very grave. The drama of those terrible days in December has passed, thank God, 
but look at the situation we now face. 
</P>
<P>
"Half a million people have lost their homes, 21 towns have been destroyed, 342 
villages have suffered heavy damage and 58 were destroyed. The economy of that 
area is in shambles, 130 factories were destroyed, we have 170,000 people 
without work and the rest of the republic is straining to support them. We have 
tens of thousands of families divided, spread around the country, because there 
is no housing here. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to rebuild our Armenia, and we need help from the world to do it. This 
is our plea to our friends who came so generously in December: Please do not 
forget us now." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign donors continue to propose projects, officials here said, but not on 
the same scale of the original emergency aid and not on the scale they believe 
is required now. 
</P>
<P>
Half a year into the reconstruction of the earthquake area, a massive 
undertaking that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged would be 
completed within two years, Armenian officials acknowledge that the effort 
might take five years -- and perhaps even longer without international 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The special commission established by the Communist Party's ruling Politburo to 
coordinate relief efforts here recently criticized the slowness in 
reconstruction, saying there had been "no substantial progress" in rebuilding 
and describing as "particularly alarming" the lack of progress in the 
earthquake zone's major towns. 
</P>
<P>
"Coordination is a major, major problem," Boris Karapetyan, director of 
earthquake studies at the Yerevan Polytechnical Institute, said of the 
reconstruction. "This is a massive undertaking, and foreign involvement is both 
a necessary and a complicating factor. We need foreign assistance -- and there 
is no doubt about that -- but our friends do not know the local conditions and 
propose things that cannot or should not be built in an earthquake-prone 
region." 
</P>
<P>
A coordinating center has been established, but its powers are still unclear, 
and reconstruction is proceeding slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"We will rebuild, of course, and we can rely on our own resources and those of 
the whole Soviet Union," said Laura Vartanyan, deputy chairman of the Armenian 
Children's Fund. "But it is a question of cost -- not so much the money cost, 
but the cost in additional human suffering if we cannot speed the 
reconstruction." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Armen Goenjian, a California psychiatrist who helped organize a mental 
health program to assist victims in dealing with the psychological trauma of 
the earthquake, strongly endorsed this plea. 
</P>
<P>
"What people need now is housing, immediate housing, and they won't have that 
at the pace reconstruction is going," Goenjian said in an interview here. "New 
housing is essential if the families, so many of which are separated now, are 
to be brought back together. Homes will give people the hope and security they 
need to recover. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The Armenian community in the United States rushed to help in December, and we 
should not let go now. But we also need to understand what the greatest needs 
are, and the housing issue is the main concern. The question will soon be where 
are we Armenian-Americans on this key issue." 
</P>
<P>
And there are also some complaints, spoken softly and with concern that they 
not reflect ingratitude, about promises made in December that, seven months 
later, are not fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
"When President Bush's son (Jeb) came (last Dec. 25), he talked about a 
donation of perhaps $1 million for the Armenian Children's Fund, but we had to 
set up a special account to receive it," Vartanyan said. "Now the account is 
established, but we have not received the donations we had hoped for. We wanted 
to use the money to purchase equipment for invalids, to put up a children's 
park in Leninakan, to buy warm clothing for winter and to help those families 
here who are taking care of our orphans. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans, particularly the Armenian community there, were of great help 
to us in our darkest hours, but we hear very little from the United States now. 
The crisis is not over -- we have so many families without homes, so many 
people without jobs -- and our children still need help." 
</P>
<P>
The continuing international assistance is, in fact, extensive, and the walls 
of Mkhitarian's office are filling up with architects' sketches, construction 
diagrams and town plans that have been approved. 
</P>
<P>
In Spitak, a town of about 25,000 at the epicenter of the quake, an 
Italian-built village -- complete with a hospital, school, clinic and 
children's center -- is going up at a new site several miles from the ruins of 
the old town, which was located over the convergence of several seismic faults. 
</P>
<P>
Norway is building a 250-bed hospital there as well. Czechoslovakia is erecting 
a school for 750 children, and Finland and Italy together will build and equip 
a 300-bed rehabilitation center for those with spinal injuries from the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
In Leninakan, which was Armenia's second-largest city with a population of more 
than 300,000, Austria is building a neighborhood complete with a clinic, 
hospital, school and 150-bed children's hospital. West Germany is building and 
equipping a polyclinic; Britain is building a school; Cuba is building two 
schools; Italy and Poland are building polyclinics; Denmark is rebuilding a 
small neighborhood, and France will erect two apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign donors are also planning to build medical facilities, schools, 
rehabilitation centers and workshops to manufacture artificial limbs and other 
prosthetic devices in other towns in northern Armenia and in Yerevan, the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Projects at Various Stages 
</P>
<P>
"We have 20 foreign projects through the planning stage and approved for 
inclusion in the reconstruction effort, and a number are already under 
construction," said Mkhitarian, who coordinates the foreign assistance in the 
reconstruction effort. "The foreign assistance is very important. In Leninakan, 
for example, we need to build 18 hospitals. With help from other republics in 
the Soviet Union, we can rebuild 12 ourselves, but we needed and got foreign 
assistance for the other six. 
</P>
<P>
"But foreign assistance of this type does not solve the problem. Armenia itself 
really needs to be reconstructed. We can do the building -- Armenians are 
natural builders, and we will have help from the whole Soviet Union -- but we 
have serious problems providing building materials, everything from cement and 
stone to doors and windows to pipes and electrical wiring. 
</P>
<P>
"So, now we are asking other countries that, instead of more hospitals or 
schools or housing, they provide us with the equipment and technology to 
redevelop the construction industry in Armenia," Mkhitarian added. 
</P>
<P>
When a donor proposes a hospital now, Armenian officials counter with a request 
for rock-quarrying equipment, cement plants, a stone-dressing factory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Matter of Understanding 
</P>
<P>
"They are not keen for such projects," Mkhitarian lamented. "These friends tell 
us, 'Our people know hospitals, they know orphanages and they know 
kindergartens, but they will never understand a project like a quarry or 
construction machinery. That is not why our people gave their money.' " 
</P>
<P>
But without the redevelopment of the Armenian construction industry, most of 
which is quite backward and much of which was centered in the earthquake area, 
it will be difficult to build any of these prestige projects, Mkhitarian said. 
</P>
<P>
Stone-cutting machinery, for example, is urgently needed because the only 
stone-processing plant in Armenia was in Leninakan and was destroyed in the 
earthquake. Stone is the most widely used construction material in rural 
Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
"We have thousands of families waiting to rebuild their houses in our villages, 
but we don't have enough stone for them," another Armenian official said. "So, 
they are living in tents and construction cabins and simply shacks, and that is 
prolonging their suffering." 
</P>
<P>
Mkhitarian is beginning to have some success in persuading foreign donors to 
supply construction equipment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promise of New Cement Factory 
</P>
<P>
A West German donor, for example, has supplied special equipment that will 
remove the steel reinforcing bars from the concrete in buildings that will be 
demolished as unsafe so that both the steel and even the cement can be reused 
in other ways. An American group that came to put up several buildings in a 
demonstration of construction techniques this month left promising to help 
establish a new cement factory here. 
</P>
<P>
And the Swiss Caritas group was persuaded to provide that factory for water 
faucets and other plumbing equipment. "I told them, 'Just think that every time 
someone in Armenia turns on the tap, he will think of the generous Swiss,' " 
Mkhitarian said. 
</P>
<P>
Caritas, in fact, is also building a large, 100-bed diagnostic center in 
Leninakan and equipping it with the latest medical instruments as well as a 
network of 21 rural dispensaries. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided last month by the Soviet Foreign Ministry in 
Moscow, about $160 million in international aid has come from foreign 
governments, $80 million from Red Cross and Red Crescent societies worldwide, 
$20 million from international organizations, $39 million from private aid 
groups and $180 million from individuals. Funds are still being raised by many 
charities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign donors are continuing to provide specialized medical care abroad for 
some of the 17,000 people injured in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Generous Medical Aid 
</P>
<P>
More than 80 children whose limbs were crushed were airlifted to different 
hospitals in the United States for surgery and rehabilitation. Scores of other 
victims have gone to countries in Eastern and Western Europe and recently to 
Israel for treatment. Medecins Sans Frontieres, the French doctors' aid group, 
has established a long-term project with more than 30 personnel here. And 
Armenian-Americans have underwritten a mental health project to help the 
earthquake victims deal with the psychological trauma. 
</P>
<P>
But Armenian officials, looking beyond both the continuing relief work and the 
rebuilding of the earthquake-devastated zone, are hoping for foreign assistance 
in developing the small Soviet republic's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Mkhitarian, who long worked in the centralized Soviet foreign trade system in 
Moscow, said Armenia hopes to turn the foreign ties that it developed through 
the relief and reconstruction effort into a network of permanent economic 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to establish a special economic zone here to attract foreign 
investors," Karapetyan, of the Yerevan Polytechnical Institute, added. "We can 
see now that future economic growth -- and that means our full recovery from 
the earthquake -- will require our opening to the outside world, our 
integration into the world economy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We think we have good prospects for this. We hope, for example, that Armenians 
abroad, particularly engineers, scientists and businessmen, will want to do 
business with us. And, of course, we are looking to the United States."

SHOTGUN SLAYINGS IN L.A. CHURCH SANCTUARY; 
</P>
<P>
DEATH FOLLOWS GRIM PROPHECY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In retrospect, it seems, Patronella Luke's was a death foretold. 
</P>
<P>
All week, the children of Mt. Olive Church of God in Christ had been studying 
the Bible in a small chapel next to the main sanctuary on a corner in Southeast 
Los Angeles. Friday night, during commencement ceremonies, the pastor, the Rev. 
J. C. Brewster, taught a chilling, although apparently unintentional, lesson 
about prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
In a voice audible to the entire congregation of about 50 people, he praised 
33-year-old Peter Luke, who was sitting near the front. Then Brewster told 
35-year-old Patronella (Pat) Luke, who was in the last row, to stand by her 
husband and support him. 
</P>
<P>
From this point, recollections differ. By one account, the minister told the 
couple, "The Lord is going to take one of you." By another, he said, "The Lord 
is going to use one of you." By yet another, "God is going to get one of you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Man Bursts In 
</P>
<P>
The pastor said he did not mean to foreshadow anybody's murder. 
</P>
<P>
But as the ceremony ended, a man burst in, clad in a black sweat suit, its hood 
pulled tight around the ski mask hiding his face. He brandished a sawed-off 
shotgun. He walked down the aisle, slowly, calmly, deliberately, turned around 
near the pulpit and walked back, stopping at Pat Luke's pew. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman trained his weapon on the people in the pew. Pat's mother, Vivian 
Worthen, raised her hand. "The blood of Jesus!" she shouted. Then, Worthen 
said, the first pellets missed their mark. Pellets from the second shot, she 
said, grazed her left shoulder and slammed into Pat's temple. Pat was gone. 
</P>
<P>
When the shooting ended, 76-year-old Mae Lee was dead, too, shot as she ran in 
fright toward the bathroom. Peter Luke was wounded in the leg and slightly in 
the arm. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, as Peter Luke was in surgery at California Medical Center in Los 
Angeles, police and parishioners tried to sort out the mystery. There were no 
suspects and no known motive. Who, they wondered, was the man in black and why 
did he pick that time, that place? 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I knew the reason," Brewster said. "I'd feel better. I could have some 
release." 
</P>
<P>
Church, after all, was supposed to be a sanctuary. Mt. Olive had always seemed 
to live up to that ideal. Although gangs and drugs were far from unknown in the 
graffiti-sprayed neighborhood surrounding the stucco building with its 
stained-glass windows, local gang members had told the pastor they'd help if he 
ever had any trouble. No gang slogans were ever scrawled across the church 
walls and a year had passed since the police had cleaned out the narcotics 
traffic in the alley in back. 
</P>
<P>
"Once, as I was coming in, a guy asked me if I wanted to buy some drugs," said 
church secretary Olevia Hart, who is the pastor's sister-in-law. "A gang member 
came up and told him to leave me alone." 
</P>
<P>
Brewster has not been particularly active in fighting drugs and gangs in the 
community, which has become largely Latino as blacks, including most of the 200 
church members, moved away. "We don't get on a soap box. That's not our 
ministry," Hart said. "We're against everything the Bible is against, but we 
don't single anything out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Veteran Police Shocked 
</P>
<P>
The idea of murders in a church shocked even veteran police officers who had 
seen many strange things over the years. "It's crazy," said Police Officer Andy 
Thedford, who has been on the force for 21 years. "It makes you want to rent an 
apartment on the moon." 
</P>
<P>
This was not, however, the first time for such violence in the Los Angeles 
area. In 1987, a bullet splintered the stained-glass window of a Baptist church 
in Watts, killing a choir member walking down the aisle after rehearsal. In 
1986, a man described as despondent over the end of his engagement opened fire 
with an automatic pistol inside a La Puente Church of Christ. He killed two 
church members and wounded two others. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a man fatally shot a pastor and a deacon inside a Chinatown Baptist 
church. A former church member, he was shot to death in a gunfight with an 
off-duty Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who had been attending the service 
with members of his San Fernando Valley congregation. 
</P>
<P>
These incidents, and now the Mt. Olive shootings, have frightened ministers. 
"We're so vulnerable to violence," said Lloyd Johnson, of Harmony Missionary 
Baptist Church in South-Central Los Angeles. "I'm afraid something like this 
will make some people start coming to church armed . . . with guns. I hope they 
won't, but in a city like this, somebody's going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Olive church members do not believe that gangs had any connection to the 
murders in their chapel. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a maniac. I think he found the people who were moving. The rest 
of the people were all on the floor," Brewster said. "The one lady was running. 
The other was trying to get her mother to the floor . . . and I think the man 
was trying to save his wife." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stalking the Lukes? 
</P>
<P>
Others wonder if the gunman was stalking the Lukes. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like he was almost looking for somebody," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy was a cold-blooded murderer," said another church member. "I'd say he 
was a hit man, not a gang member. He just came in there like he owned the 
place." 
</P>
<P>
But no one could figure out why the Lukes would be targets. Both had long been 
active in the church. She was a soprano who had traveled around the country and 
to Europe with the Albert McNeil Singers, excited about her invitation to sing 
with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in the fall. He is a computer technician who 
goes from the couple's home in Southwest Los Angeles to the neighborhood where 
he grew up, near 41st Street and Compton Boulevard, to try to talk addicts into 
giving up drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Their marriage of seven years seemed strong. Recently, said Lorna Luke, Peter 
Luke's mother, the two were teasing each other, talking about who would die 
first. The husband said he would. "Pat was saying she would. She wanted to go 
first," Lorna Luke said, "because she didn't think she could stand to see him 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Some congregants told police investigators and reporters about a squabble that 
Pat Luke's cousin was having with her husband. The cousin was also a church 
member; the husband had been in the past. The cousin had obtained a court order 
Friday to keep her husband away, because he had allegedly been threatening her. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from his hospital bed, Peter Luke declined to comment 
on the quarrel. He said, however, that the gunman was taller than the cousin's 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approach the Church 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the gunman and another armed man in black approached the church 
about 9 p.m. One man, a church member who was on the porch outside the chapel, 
said the gunman came up the stairs and muttered an obscenity. The church member 
jumped off the porch and ran, but said the gunman fired three shots at him, 
then entered the chapel. 
</P>
<P>
The second man in black stayed outside, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
In the church, the awards and certificates for completing the Bible course 
already had been handed out. The choir had sung "Jesus Loves Me," the older 
children had performed a skit and the younger children, including the Lukes' 
5-year-old "Peter Two," had answered questions about the doctrine they'd 
learned that week. 
</P>
<P>
The pastor had just finished his remarks -- including his message to the Lukes. 
He doesn't recall what his exact words were. "In my discourse when I speak, I 
sometimes don't remember what I even said," Brewster said. "When your love goes 
out, you just say it." 
</P>
<P>
"God puts words in his mouth and he speaks them," said his wife, Julia. 
</P>
<P>
As the gunman moved into the chapel, the congregants dove for cover. "I thought 
I better get my wallet out and give it to him," one deacon said. Many of the 30 
or so children, ranging in age from 4 to 15, cried and shouted for their 
mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Underneath the pew where 13-year-old Estela Lopez was hiding, "I just closed my 
eyes and started praying," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
She Ran and Was Killed 
</P>
<P>
Pat Luke was shot. Mae Lee, mother of six, a regional official of the Church of 
God in Christ who led intense, three-day prayer sessions and often took meals 
to Skid Row, ran and was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Luke saw the man point the gun at him. He prayed "Lord protect me" and 
was shot. 
</P>
<P>
"My children! My children!" Worthen screamed. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Luke was watching an 11 p.m. news show on television when he realized he 
had just seen his brother being wheeled away on a stretcher. "That's Peter!" he 
yelled, shocked. He telephoned his mother to let her know what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Worthen told little "Peter Two" about the results of the 
frightening incident they had both witnessed. "I told him his father was going 
to be operated on and his mother had gone to be with Jesus in heaven and if he 
was a good boy, he would see her," she said. The boy said he understood and 
asked if there was going to be a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
About noon, the Rev. Tobe Sneed of Mt. Olive came to open the church building 
while a squad car stood guard across the street. Blood stained the floor. Blood 
soaked a maroon choir gown that had been used to cover one of the victims and 
now lay crumpled between two overturned pews. Blood splattered a cardboard fan, 
with a funeral home advertisement, that had been used to cool a congregant 
during the sultry evening before.

BOY PROPELS HIMSELF INTO THE RECORD BOOK; 
</P>
<P>
YOUNGEST PILOT EVER TO FLY AROUND THE WORLD TOUCHES DOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Eleven-year-old Tony Aliengena landed his plane at John Wayne Airport on 
Saturday, after a sometimes treacherous 21,567-mile odyssey which made him the 
youngest pilot to circumnavigate the globe. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-grader from San Juan Capistrano performed a low fly-by for a 
welcoming crowd of about 100, then bought the borrowed Cessna 210 Centurion to 
a landing by a red carpet on the airstrip where he and his family departed June 
5. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's 2:28 p.m. arrival brought applause and cheers from friends and 
supporters who gathered on a balloon-festooned Tarmac outside Martin Aviation, 
which helped sponsor Tony's trip. 
</P>
<P>
With hordes of news people looking on, Tony taxied the single-engine plane to a 
stop alongside the red carpet. But perhaps in a fitting denouement to the 
obstacles he encountered on his trip, Tony's door jammed and he was forced to 
crawl out the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the cramped cockpit after his final 950-mile leg from Seattle, 
Tony -- accompanied by his mother, Susan, father, Gary, 10-year-old sister 
Alaina and 11-year-old Soviet pen pal, Roman Tchermenykh -- appeared nonchalant 
about his record-setting aviation accomplishment. "I'm glad to be home," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His mother was more ebullient. "It was wonderful. It was a great trip," she 
said. "Tony did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
In the half-hour ceremony that followed, more accolades were heaped upon Tony 
by local dignitaries. Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors, presented Tony with a resolution of congratulations. Eddie Martin, 
the 87-year-old patriarch of Orange County aviation and founder of Martin 
Aviation, welcomed the boy aviator with a smile and a hug. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real proud of you, real tickled to death," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Stepping on a box so he could see over a podium, Tony answered reporters' 
questions and said he had no immediate plans to match or surpass his 
around-the-world flight. 
</P>
<P>
"I might fly pole to pole," Tony joked. His father displayed an expression of 
mock surprise. 
</P>
<P>
In the ceremony, Gary Aliengena introduced and thanked all 14 members of Tony's 
entourage, which included a four-member film crew from Los Angeles, a chase 
plane pilot, a Times reporter and a Soviet journalist, who made a speech in 
halting English. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Tony is a brave pilot," said Aleksie Grinevich, correspondent for the 
Moscow newspaper Soviet Culture. "He saw many cities (in the Soviet Union). He 
saw our kids want to laugh and live in peace." 
</P>
<P>
Completion of the grueling, 7-week voyage -- dubbed Friendship Flight '89 
because of its international friendship theme -- earned Tony recognition by the 
National Aeronautic Assn. as the youngest pilot ever to fly around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The NAA, an aviation record-monitoring organization in Washington, had sent 
observer Gunter Hagen along in Tony's plane to verify that the boy remained in 
sole control of the aircraft. Hagen confirmed that Saturday, and said Tony 
never had to repeat a flight leg, as he did last year in his record-breaking 
flight as the youngest pilot to traverse the United States. Then, a flight 
instructor riding in the co-pilot's seat grabbed the plane yoke during a 
Tennessee thunderstorm, forcing Tony to redo the leg. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's trans-global flight also earned him recognition as the first private 
pilot to fly the 7,000-mile breadth of the Soviet Union. In so doing, Tony 
traveled for days over terrain so inaccessible that he was not within radar 
reach much of the time. 
</P>
<P>
The night before the last leg home, the elder Aliengena, 39, a real estate 
investor and trucking company entrepreneur, reminisced about the trip and said 
the only thing left was a meeting with President Bush. Tony, he said, wants to 
present the President with a "friendship scroll" signed by thousands of 
children during the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's arrival in Orange County was marred somewhat by the crash that took 
place last Tuesday night off a gravel airstrip in the tiny Eskimo village of 
Golovin, Alaska, where Tony's father had brought Tony and his entourage for a 
three-day fishing respite after their re-entry into the United States from the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
While ferrying Tony and six other members of his entourage out of the village 
that night, Aliengena lost control of the aircraft and it veered off a 50-foot 
embankment down to a swamp below. The right wing caught fire on impact and the 
plane suffered other major damage, but all eight occupants managed to escape 
without serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the crash, Gary Aliengena borrowed another Cessna 210 Centurion 
from Alaskan businessman Ralph C. Meloon Jr. and sought to deflect attention 
from the accident to his son's flight. 
</P>
<P>
"This is about Friendship Flight '89, not a mistake by old dad," Aliengena said 
as the family was readying to depart from Nome, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Back home in Orange County, Tony looked forward to the prospect of playing 
again with his own friends. One of them, 10-year-old David Turley, was on hand 
at the airport to welcome Tony. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gonna do lots of things," David grinned. "Like build rockets!"

HANK GREENSPUN, FIERY PUBLISHER OF LAS VEGAS SUN, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hank Greenspun, the publisher of the Las Vegas Sun who ran guns for Israel and 
public relations campaigns for mobster Bugsy Siegel before turning his 
combative talents to journalism, died Saturday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
His last of many battles was with cancer and it lasted more than a year. 
Greenspun died at his home in Regency Towers at the Las Vegas Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
In a career more colorful than many of the personalties his newspaper covered, 
Greenspun was, in turn, a decorated World War II officer, outspoken foe of 
Communist-hunting Sen. Joseph McCarthy, ally-turned-adversary of reclusive 
billionaire Howard Hughes and champion of U.S. District Judge Harry E. 
Clairborne, the first federal jurist convicted of a felony while on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
He also practiced law, was targeted by Watergate burglars, battled the Internal 
Revenue Service and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first to see the potential of Las Vegas, Greenspun founded its first 
radio station, boosted its development possibilities and eventually capitalized 
on the real estate boom which followed the casinos and gamblers to the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Journalist and author A.J. Liebling once described Greenspun as "an 
editor-publisher type supposed to have gone out with Derringer pistols and the 
Gold Rush." 
</P>
<P>
For all the controversy he generated in later life, Herman Milton Greenspun's 
early years were ordinary enough. Born in Brooklyn on Aug. 27, 1909, he 
followed his mother's wishes and became a lawyer, although the practice held 
little interest for him. 
</P>
<P>
A life-long Republican, in the early 1930s he worked for the election of 
Fiorello H. LaGuardia as mayor of New York City against the bosses of Tammany 
Hall. Greenspun was drafted into the Army in World War II, rose to the rank of 
major and served with Gen. George C. Patton's 3rd Army. 
</P>
<P>
It was during the war, stationed in Ireland, that he met and married Barbara 
Ritchie. They had four children -- Susan, Brian, Jane and Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
Back in a seemingly unexciting New York law practice at war's end, Greenspun 
jumped at the chance when a friend asked him to help start a horse racing track 
near the little known town of Las Vegas, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
The track venture failed, but Greenspun was hooked. To make ends meet, he 
published a small-circulation magazine boosting the virtues of his new 
hometown. And he did publicity for the new Flamingo Hotel that Benjamin (Bugsy) 
Siegel was just opening. When Siegel was gunned down in Los Angeles on June 20, 
1947, Greenspun ended his public relations career and started anew in 
broadcasting, opening Las Vegas' first radio station. 
</P>
<P>
That career was interrupted by a brief stint as a gun-runner for the Israelis 
in the months before independence. 
</P>
<P>
He purchased the Sun in 1950 for $104,000 using a $1,000 down payment, which he 
borrowed. Less than two weeks later, Greenspun made sure his newspaper got the 
scoop when he was convicted for his gun-running endeavor. Although he agreed to 
a guilty plea, he refused to enter the plea before the court until the 
deadlines for the Sun's chief competition had passed. Then, he wrote his own 
bylined story on his case. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun explained his journalism philosophy in a 1982 interview with Harper's 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in an objective press, a responsible press. I believe in a 
subjective press . . . I make my judgment of a guy, and it's published in the 
Las Vegas Sun."

LOCAL AIR OFFICIALS APPEAL LIMITED ROLE IN EMISSION CONTROLS

<P>
In California's arduous struggle with air pollution, local authorities have 
long played the primary role in regulating emissions from factories, refineries 
and other stationary sources of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
But now, these officials say, that power could be sharply curtailed and the 
public health threatened by an appeals court ruling that has caused deep 
concern among pollution regulators and their allies throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Joined by environmental and health groups, the authorities have asked the 
California Supreme Court to overturn the appellate decision, which they contend 
could sound the death knell for local regulation of toxic air contaminants from 
non-vehicular sources. A high court ruling is due by September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Law at Issue 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether a landmark 1983 state law, known as the Tanner Act, bars 
California's 41 local air pollution control districts from regulating toxic 
contaminants before the state Air Resources Board has analyzed and identified 
them as dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, a toxic air contaminant is one that may cause an increase in 
death or serious illness or pose "a present or potential hazard to human 
health." 
</P>
<P>
The aim of the legislation was to reduce the risk of cancer, birth defects and 
genetic mutations from air-borne pollutants. Asbestos and benzene are examples 
of substances that have been labeled as toxic by both state and federal 
authorities. Smog -- a mixture of gases and particulates -- can impair health, 
but has not been generally recognized as toxic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local Control Preempted 
</P>
<P>
The ruling under attack was issued last summer by a state Court of Appeal in 
San Jose in a lawsuit by petroleum producers and refiners against 
precedent-setting local regulations adopted by the Monterey Bay Unified Air 
Pollution Control District. In a 3-0 decision, the panel held that the Tanner 
Act preempted the district's power to regulate toxic emissions until the Air 
Resources Board had acted. 
</P>
<P>
District officials, in appealing to the state high court, say the ruling will 
create an enforcement gap in which toxic emissions could go unregulated for 
long periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
In five years, district officials note, the Air Resources Board has identified 
only nine chemicals as toxic substances. Nobody in the dispute is accusing the 
board of intentional delay. They say the process outlined for it to follow is 
just too time-consuming. The district said it wants to be able to move quickly 
on perhaps hundreds of substances that it believes could cause cancer, birth 
defects and other injury. 
</P>
<P>
"The state ARB has been incredibly slow," said Lawrence D. Odle, executive 
director of the Monterey Bay district. "We'd be abdicating our responsibility 
to the public if we didn't do something on our own." 
</P>
<P>
Officials contend that the ruling overlooks the fact that local districts may 
face threats from a substance that poses an unusual danger only to their own 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"A specific pollutant may not be a problem when viewed on a statewide basis and 
it may be way down the list at the ARB," said Daniel P. Selmi of Loyola Law 
School, an environmental law specialist representing the district in the case. 
"But that pollutant may present a very big problem in a particular area of the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, lawyers for the Western States Petroleum Assn., the group 
that challenged the Monterey Bay plan, argue that only a painstaking scientific 
review by the state can produce a reliable and consistent regulatory framework 
for controlling toxic emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing each separate district to perform its own scientific analysis can only 
lead to a patchwork of conflicting regulatory standards, the association's 
attorneys say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complex Problems 
</P>
<P>
The Air Resources Board was created to conduct research and provide guidance 
for local districts, the association says. The Legislature, in adopting the 
1983 act, meant to maintain a uniform, statewide approach to the complex 
problems of air pollution control, it contends. 
</P>
<P>
Michael A. Monahan, a Los Angeles attorney representing the petroleum 
association, notes that the Monterey Bay district has labeled about 150 
chemicals as toxic -- several of which the state already has concluded pose no 
threat to health. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that there could be air districts all over the state 
identifying hundreds of chemicals" as toxic, Monahan said. "It would create a 
regulatory nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
The Tanner Act, sponsored by Assemblywoman Sally Tanner of El Monte, was passed 
in the wake of newly emerging concern over toxic emissions from stationary 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Identify Pollutants 
</P>
<P>
The act established complex procedures in which the Air Resources Board, 
working with state health authorities, would identify toxic air pollutants and 
then design measures to control them. Local districts then were to adopt 
regulations at least as stringent as those adopted by the state board. The 
regulation of pollution from vehicles remained the sole responsibility of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the federal level, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 
recent years has adopted national air quality standards that are to be attained 
by states and local communities. To date, the EPA has identified eight 
substances that are subject to controls as hazardous air pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Bay district authorities, unsatisfied with the pace of the Air 
Resources Board, in 1986 adopted their own sweeping plan to control toxic air 
contaminants from new or modified stationary sources. To obtain a permit to 
operate, emission-producing facilities must install "reasonable" technology to 
control toxic contaminants, and if those contaminants could cause cancer, the 
facilities must employ the "best" technology to control them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Reversed 
</P>
<P>
A Monterey Superior Court upheld the local plan but the state Court of Appeal 
reversed that decision. The appellate court held that the district had no 
authority to regulate toxic emissions until they had been identified by the Air 
Resources Board. After such identification, the district could go ahead and 
regulate toxics even before the state had adopted the model rules, the court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal found that the Legislature, in passing the act, "has not 
expressly reserved" the toxic-identification process for the state. But in view 
of the "extremely detailed and thorough procedure" for identification set forth 
by the act, it was apparent the Legislature meant to leave that task 
exclusively to the state, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
In its appeal to the state Supreme Court, the district has gained support from 
a broad coalition of environmental and health groups, including the Citizens 
for a Better Environment, the American Lung Assn. of California and the Sierra 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at this case as deciding whether, in fact, we are really going to be 
regulating air contamination in California," said Alan Ramo, the attorney 
representing the coalition. "The state process is slow and cumbersome. At the 
rate they're going, it could be a hundred years before we could regulate all 
the contaminants that should be regulated." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal Backed 
</P>
<P>
Also backing the appeal are seven local air-pollution districts, including the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District -- which encompasses Los Angeles, 
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties -- and Los Angeles Dist. Atty. 
Ira Reiner, whose office prosecutes violators of pollution control laws. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast AQMD, like some other districts, is developing a plan to assess 
the risks and then adopt controls for sources of toxic emissions. The specific 
toxics that would be subject to regulation have not yet been determined, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The districts urged the justices to recognize the need for local authority in 
controlling toxics, noting for example that the South Coast AQMD on its own has 
adopted regulations to control styrene, a suspected carcinogen used in the 
manufacturer of fiberglass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regulation Argued 
</P>
<P>
Although the substance may not present a major problem in many locales, it does 
in the South Coast region and should be regulated, the districts said. 
</P>
<P>
(According to a spokesman for the South Coast AQMD, the case will not affect 
the district's recently proposed clean-air plan, which is designed to bring the 
region into compliance with federal emission standards.) 
</P>
<P>
Another important ally for the district emerged in the Air Resources Board 
itself, which contended that the act could never have been intended to alter 
the long-recognized authority of local districts to impose more stringent 
controls on non-vehicular emissions than those required by either the state or 
federal government. The board conceded that its procedures are necessarily 
time-consuming and said local districts should be free to act against toxics in 
the interim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Powerless to Regulate 
</P>
<P>
In its presentation to the court, the Monterey Bay district warned the justices 
that under the appeal panel's interpretation of the law, a new facility can 
locate in the middle of a city and emit toxic pollutants that local authorities 
would be powerless to regulate. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the district cited a dilemma it now faces in weighing the risks of 
a proposed energy-producing "biomass" facility in the region. Under the appeal 
court ruling, the district could regulate six nontoxic pollutants the plant 
will emit, but could not control the emission of arsenic and chloroform -- two 
contaminants it believes are toxic but have not been identified as such by the 
Air Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Selmi, representing the district in oral argument before the court 
last month, pointed out that under the appellate ruling, local districts 
actually would have less power to regulate toxic emissions than they do to 
control nontoxics. "The Legislature could not have intended that result," he 
said.

HANK GREENSPUN, FIERY PUBLISHER OF LAS VEGAS SUN, DIES

<P>
Las Vegas Sun publisher Hank Greenspun, who built a communications empire and 
helped transform Las Vegas from a small desert town into an entertainment 
mecca, died Saturday of cancer. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun died at his home in Regency Towers at the exclusive Las Vegas Country 
Club after a yearlong battle with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
He was a man of contrast, reckless and reasoning, combative and compassionate, 
a news writer and a news maker. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-educated lawyer was a decorated World War II combat officer, a 
one-time publicist for mobster Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel's Flamingo Hotel, a 
pioneer real estate investor and developer, and a crusading newspaper 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun founded Las Vegas' first television station, first competing daily 
newspaper and first cable television company. 
</P>
<P>
A man of action and influence who once was a Republican candidate for governor 
of Nevada, Greenspun mingled with world leaders and superstars. 
</P>
<P>
He played a behind-the-scenes role in Middle East affairs for Israel, where he 
became a national hero, cited by then-Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion for 
extraordinary service during the 1948 War of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun executed a daring gun-smuggling operation that delivered surplus U.S. 
arms to Israel during its struggle. He was convicted of Neutrality Act 
violations in 1950 and fined $10,000, but President John F. Kennedy pardoned 
him, and in his 1966 autobiography, "Where I Stand," Greenspun said it was "the 
proudest thing I've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
He hobnobbed with celebrities and attended the wedding of Frank Sinatra and Mia 
Farrow when the rest of the news media was shut out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friend of Howard Hughes 
</P>
<P>
His friendship with Howard Hughes led to the billionaire's move to Las Vegas in 
1966 on Greenspun's invitation. Hughes bailed the city out of a recession, 
whitewashed its mobster reputation and bought more than $100 million in hotels 
and land. 
</P>
<P>
Articulate, dynamic and fearless, Greenspun was a favorite interview subject 
for the national media in search of Las Vegas exposes and often appeared on 
network television. 
</P>
<P>
His widely read front-page column, "Where I Stand," which he pounded out on a 
battered Underwood typewriter, was feared and loved, ruthless and 
heart-rending. 
</P>
<P>
He both attacked and defended politicians, suspected mobsters, the federal 
government, organized labor, judges, lawmakers and citizens as he played a 
major role in shaping the skyline, reputation and policy of Las Vegas as it 
grew from a small desert town into the state's largest city and a worldwide 
tourist destination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Showed Compassion 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun never backed away from a good fight, whether the foe was a powerful 
politician, law enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service or a business mogul. 
He was compassionate toward the disadvantaged and downtrodden, employing many 
handicapped people, supporting local charities and doling out toys from a 
closet in his office to children who stopped in off the street. 
</P>
<P>
His battle scars were numerous. He triumphed over an advertising boycott of his 
newspaper instigated by U.S. Sen. Pat McCarran, and when Sen. Joseph R. 
McCarthy publicly denounced him as an "ex-communist," Greenspun turned the 
tables and accused McCarthy of being a Nazi sympathizer with communist 
leanings. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1972 Watergate scandal, burglars broke into Greenspun's office at 
the Las Vegas Sun and tried to open his safe. The publisher believed the 
intruders were White House "plumbers" seeking documents he possessed relating 
to a $100,000 contribution from Hughes to President Richard M. Nixon to lift a 
Justice Department order blocking the tycoon from buying any more Las Vegas 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
E. Howard Hunt later testified that he and G. Gordon Liddy had, indeed, planned 
a burglary of Greenspun's safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defends Claiborne 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, the Sun boldly defended Nevada federal Judge Harry Claiborne 
throughout the investigation and trials that led to Claiborne's historic ouster 
from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Born Herman Milton Greenspun in Brooklyn, N.Y., Aug. 27, 1909, Greenspun 
graduated from St. John's School of Law and aspired to be a trial lawyer but 
changed his mind after a client admitted stabbing a man to death, saying he 
could not defend such people. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun fought in France as a captain in General George S. Patton's 3rd Army. 
He was awarded the Croix de Guerre with silver star, Conspicuous Service Cross 
for the State of New York, four battle stars and a commendation from Gen. 
Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Barbara; sons, Brian and Danny; daughters Janie 
Gale and Susan Fine; a brother, David; a sister, Alice Goldberg, and nine 
grandchildren, all of Las Vegas.

Miners in the Soviet Union's biggest coal field Saturday rejected a government 
offer to end their weeklong strike, and reports indicated that half the coal 
industry's 1 million workers remained off the job. 
</P>
<P>
"All mines have stopped," the official Tass news agency reported from the 
Donets coal basin in the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
Miners in one major coal center, Karaganda in the republic of Kazakhstan, began 
returning to work after negotiators worked out a settlement package, Tass said. 
But other strikes were depriving vital factories of fuel and threatening 
industry nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The Donets basin has 121 pits with an annual production of 210 million metric 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 miners gathered outside government offices in the city of Donets 
and rejected the pact, which would have increased vacation time and paid 
workers for time spent descending into pits.

The wife of Liberia's former defense minister persuaded a police inspector to 
help her make a human sacrifice to further her husband's career, a 
court-martial heard. 
</P>
<P>
Inspector Joe Lesolee told the court Friday that he killed Patrolman J. Melvin 
Pyne on orders of former Defense Minister Gray D. Allison and with help from 
his wife, Watta Allison. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Allison, stripped of his office in June, is charged with killing 
Pyne, whose body was found March 31 with his heart ripped out on a railway 
track near Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Lesolee said Watta Allison proposed they make a sacrifice. When he suggested a 
sheep, she replied: "A sheep? Lesolee, my man, I thought you were a man. What 
we want with sheep?" 
</P>
<P>
She said they needed human blood. Lesolee said he and Watta Allison recruited 
officer Pyne and got him drunk. Lesolee then hit him with an iron bar. A nurse 
slit Pyne's throat and drained the blood into a bucket, Lesolee said.

L.A.'S ARMENIA QUAKE RELIEF STUCK IN PIPELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than seven months after Los Angeles-area Armenians mobilized to help their 
earthquake-ravaged homeland, the bulk of the more than $6 million in relief 
money raised has yet to be spent, and Armenian organizations are only now 
making concrete plans about what to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the largest single coalition of Southern California Armenian groups 
formed to coordinate disaster relief -- the Glendale-based Earthquake Relief 
Fund for Armenia -- announced that it is allocating $1.5 million to construct 
prefabricated housing in a small Armenian village destroyed by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
But the group has not yet signed a contract with a housing manufacturer, and 
the money has yet to be spent. In addition, more than $4 million that local 
Armenian leaders estimate has been raised by other Los Angeles-area Armenian 
organizations is still sitting in U.S. bank accounts while Armenian leaders 
squabble about what to do with the funds. 
</P>
<P>
Armenian organizations in the United States have been slow to spend the money 
because they are not accustomed to dealing with disaster on such a vast scale 
and they are skeptical about turning over money to the Soviet government, which 
most Armenians feel has done them wrong, Armenian community leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're the Red Cross or something, you're all set up to help," said Flora 
Dunaian, a wholesale veterinary distributor active in the Western Diocese of 
the Armenian Church. "For us, in the beginning it was a little difficult. We 
didn't know which way was up, and there was dissension as to how the money 
would be controlled. It's just been one thing after another." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Armenian community leaders say that most of the money collected for 
earthquake relief is earmarked for projects not directly related to the quake 
itself. Those leaders say their relief efforts are now entering a new phase -- 
away from sending food, blankets and medical equipment and toward taking 
advantage of perestroika -- the Soviet government's policy of political and 
economic restructuring -- to inject money and knowledge into the sagging 
Armenian economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Our church collected a quarter of a million dollars, and those people 
responsible for suggesting how it would be spent were very cautious," said 
Joseph Zeronian, deacon of the United Armenian Congregational Church in 
Hollywood. "Meanwhile, relief was going on and decisions were not made 
properly. So consequently, here we are down eight months, there's no immediate 
relief need left, so people are changing their perspectives to projects that 
will improve the lives of these people over the long term." 
</P>
<P>
The debate that slowed the Armenian-American response to the Dec. 7 earthquake 
was marked by fiscal conservatism, Armenian officials involved in the 
discussions said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Earthquake Relief Fund for Armenia, for example, disagreements arose 
over whether the bulk of the collected money should be used to supply food, 
medical supplies or housing. More than $500,000 worth of food and medical 
equipment was sent by the organization immediately after the quake, but since 
then, the idea of spending money on housing seems to have won out. 
</P>
<P>
"We have enough money to build about 50 houses initially," said Berdj 
Karapetian, spokesman for the Earthquake Relief Fund. "The arguments started 
over doing that versus sending blankets to 20,000 people. We realized that no 
matter which way we go, with $1.3 million we will not satisfy all the people 
who need help over there. But if we initiate a process, maybe it can have a 
snowball effect." 
</P>
<P>
The process of giving has been further slowed by the difficulty of dealing with 
the Soviet government, Armenian officials here said. Among Armenians, a 
diaspora people traditionally skeptical of those in power, decisions on where 
to spend their money have been hampered by their deep-rooted distrust of the 
Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worry Over Disbursement 
</P>
<P>
"There has always been a concern about handing the moneys over to a Communist 
country, about whether it would be disbursed properly," Zeronian said. "Right 
now things are open, but with that country, you never know." 
</P>
<P>
At the Armenian Assembly of America, for example, officials finally decided in 
April to donate the $3 million the organization raised nationwide to equip four 
factories in Soviet Armenia. But what a spokeswoman for the assembly called 
"Soviet roadblocks" have so slowed the process that the factories are far from 
being built. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian Protestants in the United States, a minority in the predominantly 
Roman Catholic community, have collected more than $2 million in donations for 
earthquake relief, and little of that has been spent, church officials said. 
Those officials said they plan eventually to invest the money in construction 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The intense discussions about how to use the relief funds are the outgrowth, 
perhaps more than anything else, of the consuming and passionate interest 
Armenians have in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Since Armenians in Southern California first heard of the disaster, talk of the 
earthquake and its victims has occupied almost every community event, religious 
gathering and family get-together. Southern California is home to more than 
250,000 Armenians, the largest community of this scattered people in the world 
outside Soviet Armenia. In the tight-knit community, there are few who don't 
have some connection to someone affected by the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
That near-obsession has translated into astonishing stories of generosity. In 
the weeks after the quake, Armenian-American businessmen donated private planes 
to carry cargo to the devastated country, and more than 50 tons of medical 
equipment were sent by Los Angeles-area doctors, who also paid their own plane 
fare to get to the earthquake zone. 
</P>
<P>
So many Armenian engineers, architects and businessmen in the United States 
have plans to donate money toward the revitalization of the Armenian economy 
that an Armenian-American engineering association has set up an office in 
Yerevan, complete with phone and facsimile machine. 
</P>
<P>
Armenian students in Los Angeles and elsewhere are signing up for summer 
volunteer jobs reconstructing buildings in Armenia. And more than a dozen 
Soviet Armenian children injured in the earthquake have been flown to Los 
Angeles for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Armenian-American leaders say that questions about the deliberate pace of their 
relief efforts miss the mark. They say that they are trying their best to help 
their people; the money they have collected was donated to help Soviet Armenia, 
they say, and that is what it will do. 
</P>
<P>
"One may judge that the relief effort should have happened faster, but there is 
no perfect solution," Karapetian said. "It's frustrating. We are getting the 
feeling that they are sinking deeper and deeper over there and there is very 
little that you can do. With our little bit of money, we just want to restore a 
little bit of hope."

Armenian relief -- An article on July 23 incorrectly stated the amount of money 
that the Earthquake Relief Fund for Armenia, a nonprofit relief organization in 
Glendale, had allocated to construct prefabricated housing in a small Armenian 
village destroyed by the December earthquake. The total allocation was $2.5 
million. The same article misstated the religious affiliation of the majority 
of Armenians as Roman Catholic. Most Armenians belong to the Armenian Apostolic 
Church, which is related to the Eastern Orthodox faith.

A tractor-trailer truck smashed into a line of cars and trucks stalled by an

<P>
Padre Manager Jack McKeon, feeling mighty proud of his latest trade Saturday 
afternoon, leaned back in his office chair and pulled out a new cigar to 
celebrate the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
The phone had been ringing all morning with congratulatory calls and reporters 
wanting to know just how McKeon had pulled off his latest coup. 
</P>
<P>
Well, enough of that, he said, it's time to go to work. He pulled out his 
lineup card and routinely jotted down the names of the players in the first six 
spots. He had started to write down the name of the seventh hitter when a odd 
look spread across his face. 
</P>
<P>
Puzzled, he looked up and said, "Hey, how do you spell the guy's name?" 
</P>
<P>
It is Mike Pagliarulo, and if the Padres' prayers are answered, not only will 
people be able to spell it, but he'll become a household name in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres acquired Pagliarulo, a left-handed hitting third baseman, and 
right-handed pitcher Don Schulze from the New York Yankees in exchange for Walt 
Terrell and a minor-league player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
It appears to be a perfect matchup on paper. The Padres, yearning for an 
everyday third baseman since the departure of Graig Nettles, have found a 
player that they believe can fill the bill. Schulze, who will join the team 
Tuesday, will step into the rotation and make his first start Saturday against 
the Dodgers. And the Yankees, who still have ideas about catching Baltimore in 
the American League East, have found a pitcher who should help them in the 
pennant stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem now is having the cooperation of the participants. Pagliarulo, 
29, was hitting .197 with four homers and 16 RBIs in a platoon situation at 
third with the Yankees. Terrell, 31, was 5-13 with a 4.01 ERA in 19 starts. And 
Schulze, 26, has bounced around in seven organizations, spending all but seven 
starts in the minor leagues since the end of the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
So, little risk was involved. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell, who is making $725,000, is eligible for free agency at the end of the 
season. The Padres didn't know if Terrell wanted to be back with the little run 
support he had received. And Terrell didn't know if the Padres wanted him back 
with the way he was pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo, meanwhile, has been deteriorating by the season. After hitting 28 
homers with 71 RBIs in his second full season in 1986, and coming back with 32 
homers and 87 RBIs in 1987, the Yankees felt that they too had found a 
replacement for Nettles. But instead of improving, Pagliarulo hit .216 with 15 
homers and 67 RBIs in 1988 and this year was just having a terrible time. 
</P>
<P>
Battling three separate hamstring injuries, Pagliarulo hit .190 after the 
All-Star break last season, with six homers and 14 RBIs. Still, he went into 
spring training and was promised by Yankee Manager Dallas Green that he would 
be the everyday third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, after seven at-bats, that all changed," Pagliarulo said. "And once that 
happened, I didn't have a need to talk to him (Green) anymore." 
</P>
<P>
It indeed appeared to escalate Pagliarulo's deterioration. There were days he 
was getting ripped by Green in one New York tabloid and in another by Yankee 
owner George Steinbrenner. Even the fans started getting in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon still kept monitoring the situation closely. He thought he had a 
four-way deal worked out in the 1988 winter meetings that would have brought 
Pagliarulo and Chicago Cub shortstop Shawon Dunston for catcher Sandy Alomar 
Jr., infielder Dickie Thon and reliever Greg Booker. It fell apart when the 
Texas Rangers refused to part with third baseman Steve Buechele. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon and Yankee General Manager Syd Thrift talked again in the spring, but 
this time, the Yankees were asking for Padre pitcher Eric Show. McKeon told 
them to get serious, but before they decided to trade Pagliarulo, please call 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Thrift called. He asked McKeon if he was still interested. 
McKeon assured him he was, and Thrift told him he'd get back to him with the 
name of a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift called Thursday afternoon, not realizing the Padres were playing a day 
game, and left a message. McKeon called back Friday morning, and by game-time, 
they had a deal. The club officials were notified Friday night, the players 
involved were telephoned Saturday morning, and at 10 a.m., it was announced. 
</P>
<P>
"I've liked him for years," McKeon said. "When I saw him, he was very 
productive. What happened since, I don't know. But let's see if we can't 
recharge him. 
</P>
<P>
"You're taking a chance, but you're getting a guy who's done it before, and you 
hope he can do it again." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres will find out quickly just what kind of player they got. McKeon 
plans on playing Pagliarulo every day at the outset and will bench him only 
against certain left-handers. Although he comes here in a four-for-33 slump 
overall, and has batted .199 for his career against lefties, he will be given a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all I want," Pagliarulo said. "There's a difference between playing bad 
and being a bad player. And I don't think I'm a bad player." 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Pagliarulo left certain members of the Padres knowing just 
how the front-office views them. It's apparent now that the Padres think of Bip 
Roberts and Luis Salazar as only utility players; Carmelo Martinez will be 
permanently replaced as the starting left fielder by Chris James, and they are 
counting on Andy Benes of their triple-A team in Las Vegas to join the rotation 
by the start of the 1990 season, if not sooner. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, even when I first came here," Terrell said, "I didn't think I'd be 
here for more than a year. It was like, 'Well, we'll get him for a year, let 
him pitch, and then let him become a free agent.' 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to say here, but with all the other pitchers signed, and with Benes 
in triple-A, I don't think there was a place for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not blaming anyone. I didn't pitch like I can, and hopefully I can pitch a 
lot better for the Yankees than I did here. Hopefully, I'll be pitching a long 
time, but if I keep pitching the way I am now, it'll be in Whiffle ball."

WHY MANY CONTEMPORARY ARTWORKS ARE FALLING APART -- AND HOW CONSERVATORS ARE 
FIGHTING BACK

<P>
Most visitors at "A Forest of Signs," at the Museum of Contemporary Art's 
Temporary Contemporary facility in Little Tokyo, see an intriguing array of 
ideas set forth in texts and objects. Art conservators see a mass of problems. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow blotches have appeared on the faces of poets, philosophers and painters 
in Mike Kelley's corridor of portraits, called "Pay for Your Pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Cindy Sherman's photographs are rippled, a few so badly that 
replacement prints had to be substituted for the ones originally sent to the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Three vinyl panels in Gretchen Bender's "People and Pain," a neon-lighted work 
based on 1988 movie titles, came unglued and fell off during shipping. 
</P>
<P>
The paper on Mitchell Syrop's panels that borrow the advertising phrase, "lift 
and separate," have themselves begun to lift and separate from their backing. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Koons' polychromed wood sculptures, less than a year old, were late in 
arriving because they needed repairs, registrar Mo Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
What is the meaning of this? Is the art of our time falling apart? 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, yes, and the implications are serious for artists who want to be 
remembered, for collectors who pay ever-higher prices for contemporary art and 
for museums charged with maintaining the art. Furthermore, the problem isn't 
limited to artists' latest creations. Conservation problems plague the entire 
field of contemporary art (the contemporary art period generally is defined as 
1945 to the present). 
</P>
<P>
Some of Robert Rauschenberg's most prized "Combines" from the '50s, for 
example, are in need of serious attention. "Untitled (Man in the White Shoes)," 
a 1955 Rauschenberg in MOCA's Panza collection, is undergoing an $18,000 
conservation job ($11,000 of it paid for by a grant from the National Endowment 
for the Arts). 
</P>
<P>
The 7-foot-tall box-like construction, containing a stuffed chicken, gauze 
curtains, a pair of men's shoes, an anonymous landscape painting and 
autobiographical collaged elements (childhood drawings by Rauschenberg's son, 
Christopher, and photographs of his family), requires a variety of conservation 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
MOCA has no staff conservator, so the museum has contracted four specialists to 
do the work: Tatyana Thompson for the painted parts of the piece, Glenn Wharton 
for the objects, Mark Watters for paper components and Sharon Shore for 
textiles. Shore has already completed the job of cleaning the chicken, which is 
now wrapped in plastic until the rest of the conservation is done. 
</P>
<P>
Specialists trace contemporary art's conservation ills to the flowering of an 
experimental approach to materials and techniques. "Before World War II, 
artists' materials were limited. They painted on panel or canvas and there was 
a limited number of sculpture materials. But since then, everything has become 
fair game -- anything out of the garbage dump or the refrigerator," said Pieter 
Meyers, head of conservation at the County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Along with this liberated approach to the physical components of art came a 
change of attitude. "In the '50s, Action Painting was de rigueur. If you spent 
more than 30 seconds on anything you were overworking it," said artist George 
Herms, describing some of his early works that were held together by a single 
nail. His vintage assemblages of castoff materials were made to look old and 
tattered. 
</P>
<P>
Disdain for workmanship was a result of "growing up with the atomic bomb," 
Herms said. "The generation of artists who came to maturity knowing that we 
could be blown up any minute didn't see much point in making art to last 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
Whether creating from a new sense of freedom or as a political statement, 
artists in the last three decades have produced a proliferation of notably 
impermanent art. And now that conservators must deal with these works, there is 
no shortage of horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
One well known case concerns five murals commissioned in 1961 for Harvard 
University from Abstract Expressionist Mark Rothko. Because of unstable 
pigments and overexposure to sunlight, the paintings began to fade almost as 
soon as they were installed in the Holly Oak Center, a lounge for faculty and 
administrators. Deterioration continued until first one panel and then the 
whole set had to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no expectation that these paintings will ever return to exhibition or 
to permanent installation," said Richard Koshalek, director of the Museum of 
Contemporary Art, who presented the Rothko case last winter at a conservation 
symposium in Los Angeles. The loss of "a major set of post-World War II 
paintings" (one that would be worth millions on today's market) is particularly 
bitter because it occurred at one of the nation's most distinguished 
institutions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rothko is partly responsible for the Harvard disaster. He sometimes bought his 
paints at Woolworth's and used egg whites for a medium and for surface effects. 
But he wasn't alone in his cavalier use of materials. Hard pressed for cash, 
fellow Abstract Expressionists Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline often used 
inexpensive house paint, which tends to shrink, crack and discolor on canvas. 
Kline mixed thick paints that had different drying properties and used 
incorrect proportions of medium and paint. 
</P>
<P>
A subsequent generation of Color Field and stain paintings on unprimed canvas 
has faded, sometimes changing color to an extraordinary degree, and exposed 
fabric has yellowed and become dirty, according to Joseph Fronek, conservator 
of paintings at the County Museum of Art. At work on "Cinema di Pepsi V," a 
1966 painting by Frank Stella, Fronek explained that contemporary unvarnished 
works have to be dry-cleaned with erasers or special solvents that don't wet 
the fabric and cause it to expand or contract. Old Master canvases, on the 
other hand, are covered with paint and sealed with varnish so they can be 
cleaned with small amounts of water or organic solvents. 
</P>
<P>
Problems can be even more severe when artists such as Pop master Claes 
Oldenburg venture into highly unorthodox materials. Insects have attacked his 
chocolate sculptures, and his fragile chicken-wire and plaster objects from the 
early '60s are dirty and cracked, including those in MOCA's collection. 
Oldenburg's "Giant Pool Balls," in the County Museum of Art's collection, has 
been repainted twice -- most recently by a body shop that specializes in 
painting luxury autos. 
</P>
<P>
Such examples indicate a legacy of deteriorating art. It's a fact of life for 
artists who favor unconventional materials and pride themselves on challenging 
traditional notions about permanence and value. It's also a fact of life for 
collectors who pay private conservators $50 to $100 an hour for their services. 
</P>
<P>
But should contemporary art be allowed to rot in peace? Or is a massive 
education campaign needed to awaken artists and collectors to a threat to our 
cultural heritage? A series of interviews with artists, conservators and 
collectors produced the following responses to these queries: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is the conservation of contemporary art a serious issue? 
</P>
<P>
Conservators who breathe new life into damaged art and serious-minded 
collectors agree that it is, but artists' opinions vary. "It's not a huge 
concern for me. I'm more interested in spurring ideas," said Mike Kelley, whose 
past exhibitions include entire walls of raw, unframed drawings. "When I was 
young, I just used anything I had access to. Now I try to use paper that won't 
discolor, but ephemeral material is part of the anti-heroicism of my work." 
</P>
<P>
The banner-like portraits in "A Forest of Signs" were done to his 
specifications by a house painter, Kelley said, and the yellowed portions are 
the result of too much thinner mixed with the pigment. At first Kelley was 
shocked by the discoloration, which occurred almost immediately, he said, "but 
now it doesn't bother me. It gives a sense of age that's appropriate to the 
subject." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that all viewers should get the same ride," Herms said, explaining 
that he wants today's audience to have the same experience of his vintage 
pieces as people who saw them many years ago. The letters LOVE that appear on 
his works are "a seal of approval," he said, and an indication that he wants 
viewers 100 years from now to see the work as he created it. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Houston, who is best known for fragile assemblages made of tiny plastic 
toys, has taken to enclosing some of his works in plexiglass boxes to avoid 
breakage, though he believes that interferes with their sculptural quality. He 
also worries about the durability of the plastic components. "Plastic cups on 
the beach seem to last forever, but we don't really know how durable some of 
these plastics are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"An artist has to weigh choices -- the effect of the moment against 
permanence," said Alexis Smith, whose narrative collages are based on American 
Pop culture and literature. That balance tends to change as an artist matures, 
she said. "At the beginning when you are giving your work away, you don't feel 
a big responsibility for making it last. But when people start paying 
reasonable prices for it, you take more care so that you and they won't have 
problems. I try to make things as well as I can, as archival as possible. I 
don't skimp on materials or technology." 
</P>
<P>
 -- When is conservation appropriate and how far should artists and 
conservators go to repair damage? 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as an artwork enters our collection, we have a big commitment to do 
whatever we can to maintain the original intent of the artist," Meyers said. 
That philosophy may indicate treatment, but "it also prevents us from doing all 
kinds of things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It may even prevent the museum from calling in the artist, as it did last year 
when conservators found a flaw on the surface of "Blue Curve III," a 1972 
diamond-shaped painting. Meyers said: "Ellsworth Kelly loves to have perfect 
surfaces. Even a thumbprint is an imperfection to him. He was very helpful and 
repainted the piece. But now I have difficulty with it (Kelly's repair). How do 
I know it is the same color blue, that the surface is exactly the same, that 
there are not subtle differences? I would not do that again. I would leave it 
the way it was, the way he intended it because Ellsworth Kelly in 1988 not the 
same as Ellsworth Kelly in 1972." 
</P>
<P>
"When I am called in to restore a work, I try to put myself in the spirit of 
the artist who made the piece 30 years ago, but I usually break more than I 
repair," Herms said. "I call it restoration comedy." 
</P>
<P>
The crew working at MOCA on Rauschenberg's "Combine" has no intention of 
putting the piece in pristine condition. Their cleaning and repairs will be 
"consistent with the artist's presumed intention," according to a prepared 
statement. Self-destruction is often built into contemporary art in the form of 
incompatible materials, said Wharton, a member of the MOCA team. The best that 
conservators can do in such cases is "to help the art live a little longer," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The rule of thumb for conservation is that all treatments should be reversible 
and that the artist's intentions at the time of creation should be honored. 
Conservators say that the best thing a museum can provide is a stabile 
environment, one in which temperature and humidity are constant. "We can't stop 
deterioration, but we can retard it because we have an ideal environment. The 
problem is more difficult for smaller institutions and private collectors," 
Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Are experimental methods and materials the only source of conservation 
problems? 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely not. 
</P>
<P>
A lack of knowledge about -- or concern for -- safe display and storage is a 
major cause of damage to contemporary art, conservators agree. 
</P>
<P>
"There's almost a total absence of knowledge on how to treat, preserve and 
store works of art" on the part of both individual and corporate collectors, 
Meyers said. "Most banks and other corporations that collect art have no 
conservators and don't know how to store art." 
</P>
<P>
Interior design also conflicts with conservation, according to Meyers. "The 
airy, light styles of today's houses are disastrous for contemporary art," 
which often contains unstable dies that fade easily in sunlight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Poor packing and shipping is a big killer of artworks," Smith said, citing 
another frequent complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibitions, particularly those that travel from place to place, take a big 
toll on artworks. There's a limit to how many times, say, Frank Stella's 
painted metal constructions can be dismantled and reassembled without weakening 
them. When that sort of wear is combined with faulty packing and handling, the 
results can be disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
Collector Robert H. Halff, who often loans art to exhibitions, said that it is 
not unusual for loaned works to be damaged and that the problem is more likely 
to come from shipping and handling than the artist's workmanship. Known as a 
generous donor and lender, he said that some works in his collection are now 
too fragile to travel. 
</P>
<P>
Loans -- and even damage -- can produce good stories, however. One of Halff's 
past loans had a funny twist that he likes to tell visitors to his collection. 
An insect was stuck in the wax surface of his prized Jasper Johns' encaustic, 
"Figure 7," when Halff took it to Art Services to be specially framed for 
Johns' retrospective. Assuming the bug to be an intruder, Halff asked Manny 
Silverman of Art Services to remove it, but Silverman (who now has his own 
gallery) thought Johns might have put the insect in the art and intended it to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
Halff contacted Johns, who said no, encaustic attracts bugs, so Silverman 
removed the visitor. But when Halff got the piece back from the exhibition a 
tiny piece of encaustic had chipped off exactly where the insect had been. "I 
call it 'Memorial to the Bug,' " Halff said.

 -- What's the solution to the conservation of contemporary art? 
</P>
<P>
There's no quick fix, but a heightened awareness could lead to prevention of 
some of the most serious problems, conservators say. 
</P>
<P>
One hopeful sign is that conservators are building up experience in working 
with unorthodox materials. LACMA conservator Sharon Blank, for example, is a 
biochemist whose expertise in plastics has been in demand on everything from 
Barbie dolls and Tupperware to sculpture by Russian modernist Naum Gabo. At 
LACMA, she has worked on an Edward Kienholz assemblage and Charles Frazier's 
"Anno Domini 1962," a globe covered with plastic toys. 
</P>
<P>
Some conservators suggest that art schools might do more to educate their 
students about conservation, but artists often disagree. "There's a danger of 
making the work too precious before that's appropriate," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I teach at UCLA, we destroy everything at the end of the quarter," Herms 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"An artist should have an awareness of using proper materials, what paints are 
stabile, what technology to use. But there's no way to limit materials, to have 
a conservator's stamp of approval," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
While it's his business to be concerned about conservation, Meyers maintains a 
philosophical distance. "If we can't take out imperfections without changing 
the art, we have to change the way the public looks at art. Remember that we 
are not seeing Rembrandt's paintings the way Rembrandt painted them, but we 
still enjoy and appreciate them. The greens in Dutch 17th-Century paintings 
have turned brown, but our eyes have adjusted. It should be just as easy to 
adjust to changes in contemporary art." 
</P>
<P>
Herms injected a bit of humor into an otherwise worrisome situation: "I think 
we need cryogenics for art. The solutions to these problems will be discovered. 
In the meantime we should freeze the art."

JUST HOW FAR CAN (OR SHOULD) MOVIES GO?; 
</P>
<P>
THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT MOVIE MAYHEM IS USED BY FILM MAKERS WITH VERY LITTLE 
TO SAY 
</P>

Item: A recent national survey reveals that the majority of Americans think 
there is too much sex, violence and profanity on the screen these days and that 
the overall quality of films is down. 
</P>
<P>
Item: During a recent Columbia Pictures Entertainment stockholders meeting, a 
New Jersey man rose to complain angrily about the "rotten language and explicit 
sex and violence" in movies and urged the leaders of the studio to take a role 
in cleaning up Hollywood's act. 
</P>
<P>
Item: Tom Pryor, the erstwhile editor of Daily Variety, railed against the 
three deadly sins in a recent Variety column, saying there "is a growing 
concern throughout the land over the vulgarity now commonplace on the screen 
under the pretext that this is how America speaks." 
</P>
<P>
Item: The movie business is booming. This summer's box office grosses will 
shatter all previous records and, according to industry projections, the 
theatrical and video outlets for films will combine to take in more than $8 
billion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Conclusion: You can never have too much sex, violence and profanity in movies, 
especially bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
It is axiomatic in most commercial enterprises to leave alone what is not 
broken, and in Hollywood, clearly the motivation to "clean up its act" is 
missing. Movies are hot in the leisure-time marketplace and since there is no 
apparent increase in quality to explain the increase in foot traffic, consumers 
seem to be getting exactly the amount of sex, violence and profanity they want. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest irony about the current backlash to film content is the Rip Van 
Winkle timing of the protesters. Sexual candor, blunt language and graphic 
violence have been staples of mainstream Hollywood movies for more than 20 
years! What have you seen lately that is as violent as Sam Peckinpah's "The 
Wild Bunch" (1969)? Which recent movie has dealt with sex as bluntly as Mike 
Nichols' "Carnal Knowledge" (1971), or as explicitly as Bernardo Bertolucci's 
"Last Tango in Paris" (1973)? When has the F-word count topped that in Sidney 
Lumet's "Dog Day Afternoon" (1975), or in George Roy Hill's "Slap Shot" (1977)? 
</P>
<P>
To side with Hollywood on most issues is to risk acquiring fleas, but the 
rising hysteria over the graphic content of movies seems to be just one more 
attempt by the Morally Offended of the Reagan-Bush Era to return us all to the 
square roots of the Eisenhower Era, to the hot pop culture days of lava lamps 
and "Pillow Talk." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not that there is too much sex, violence and profanity in movies 
today, but that there are too many movies that depend on those elements to sell 
them. Whether it's a reflection of film makers' limited skills or America's 
sleepy apolitical mood, movies of the '80s have been comic strip panels -- with 
cartoon violence and passionless romance veiling the fact that the movies don't 
have anything to say. 
</P>
<P>
In responding to that plaintiff Columbia Pictures stockholder two weeks ago, 
the studio's chief executive officer, Victor Kaufman, said the pendulum is 
swinging back on sex and violence. Kaufman said the industry reacts to the 
"public's needs" (he meant, of course, the public's wants) and said that there 
is less graphic content in films today than there was five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The statement got a harrumph from Tom Pryor in his Variety column, and it would 
take a brain-damaging amount of research to prove or disprove it. But Kaufman 
is probably right. After we've heard Marlon Brando order the butter in "Last 
Tango in Paris," what's to shock us about sex? After seeing that prowler get 
his head caught in a bear trap in "Straw Dogs," what's to shock us about 
violence? After hearing Jack Nicholson ream a bartender in "The Last Detail," 
what's to shock us about profanity? 
</P>
<P>
Film makers are showing more restraint today because they can't top what's gone 
before, and besides, the industry's rating system -- once the ally of the 
bolder film makers -- has grown so conservative and powerful, real craziness in 
commercial movies is virtually impossible. Film makers now have to agree in 
their contracts to deliver movies with R ratings or less, a fact that has 
turned the ratings board into a willing censor. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to reacting to national mood swings, Hollywood moves just a 
little quicker than an Eric Rohmer film. But it does react, as it did in the 
mid-'60s when restraints on film content were, by popular demand, lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Individual film makers have continued to push the envelope on content -- on 
violence, in particular -- but the general run of films of the last decade have 
been far less provocative than those of the decade before. In fact, like all 
dam burstings, it was the first wave of unrestrained film making that hurled 
the most power. 
</P>
<P>
Flash back to those seminal days of the New Freedom in Hollywood, to the 
landmark films of Sex, Violence and Profanity. Scholars will debate the date of 
conception of the new era, but the founding fathers were directors Michelangelo 
Antonioni, who gave us frontal nudity in "Blow-Up" (1966), Mike Nichols, who 
gave playwright Edward Albee's raw stage dialogue screen time in "Who's Afraid 
of Virginia Woolf?" (1966), and Arthur Penn, whose balletic gun battles in 
"Bonnie and Clyde" (1967) showed how ugly and compelling death could really be. 
</P>
<P>
Those were great movies, in the same way the American Revolution was a great 
war. They jolted the film industry out of decades of servitude (to the 
oppressive Hays Code) and opened up new frontiers for daring film makers and 
their patron studios. Those blunt films got people away from their TV sets long 
enough to kick-start their hearts and arguably saved the majors from becoming 
mere suppliers to the networks. 
</P>
<P>
The film revolution, of course, was a sign of the times. "Blow-Up" opened in 
American theaters at about the same time the long-banned books of Henry Miller 
went on sale in Boston. And when Americans went to the streets in mass to 
protest U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Hollywood makes what sells (some things 
never change) and in the anti-Establishment frenzy of the '60s, explicit pop 
art sold. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the early pictures that dropped the jaws of our elders had themes that 
transcended their sensational elements and engendered enthusiasm among 
telented, intellectually driven film makers who thrived in the new environment. 
Hollywood suddenly had as much to say about the lives and politics of America 
as the publishing world. For that blink in time, film was literature. 
</P>
<P>
Without those break-through movies, Stanley Kubrick could not have made "A 
Clockwork Orange." John Schlesinger could not have made "Midnight Cowboy." John 
Boorman could not have done "Deliverance." Nor could Francis Coppola have done 
either of "The Godfather" movies, two of Hollywood's last masterpieces. Bob 
Fosse's film career might not have occurred at all (at the loss to us of 
"Cabaret," "Lenny" and "All That Jazz"). 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood's brief, Golden Era of social and political consciousness, 
spanning roughly the years 1966 to 1979, Sidney Lumet ("Dog Day Afternoon," 
"Network"), Robert Altman ("M*A*S*H," "McCabe and Mrs. Miller"), Hal Ashby 
("Shampoo," "Coming Home"), Milos Forman ("One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"), 
William Friedkin ("The French Connection," "The Exorcist"), Alan J. Pakula 
("Parallax View," "All the President's Men"), Martin Scorsese ("Taxi Driver"), 
Bob Rafelson ("Five Easy Pieces"), Roman Polanski ("Chinatown"), Michael Cimino 
("The Deer Hunter"), even Woody Allen ("Annie Hall") made their most powerful 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
Go back and clean them up -- take out all the rotten language, explicit sex and 
violence -- and see what you've got. 
</P>
<P>
It is interesting to hear so much grumbling about film content at the end of a 
decade noted for its timidity. Since George Lucas and Steven Spielberg arrived 
to marry old-fashioned myths and legends to state-of-the-art special effects 
and reap fortunes, the studios have been preoccupied with trying to repeat the 
examples. There have been many excessively foul-mouthed movies, and many that 
trivialized sex and violence. There have also been a few good films of social 
importance, though serious critics may have trouble finding enough to fill out 
their decade-end Top 10 lists. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, the '80s have showcased slick, anti-intellectual fantasies -- whether 
in the form of teen-age sex comedies, slasher horror movies, science-fiction, 
adventure or drama. And regardless of their ratings. Fifteen years ago, an R on 
a film was just as likely to flag serious themes for moviegoing adults as it 
was to alert drooling teens to forbidden fruits. When this century is written, 
the film decade that the '80s will most resemble is, erk, the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
So, what would those people protesting the content of today's movies have 
Hollywood do, wash its mouth out with soap, then what? If the industry leaders 
took the polls seriously and purged all sex, violence and profanity from its 
movies, Warner Bros. would be facing the threat of a leveraged buy-out from 
Bob's Bait Shop instead of Paramount Entertainment. You cannot withdraw from 
consumers what has been given, not with ticket prices escalating four bits a 
year. Moviegoers today expect to have as much salt in their movies as they have 
on their popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
The real sin of the last decade is that there have not been enough smart, 
socially conscious movies told with whatever sex, violence and profanity was 
necessary, and too many that merely used those elements to pander to the tastes 
of the broadest audience. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for those of us who agree that "they don't make movies like they 
used to" is that convenient neighborhood video stores stock all the movies they 
used to make. If we don't like what's out there -- either because it's too 
strong, or not strong enough -- we can vote with our VCRs.

DEATH AND DESTRUCTION SEEM TO DRIP FROM THE SCREEN AS NEVER BEFORE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Time magazine's recent cover story is devoted to the way 464 Americans were 
killed by guns in a single week, and some of the biggest box-office movies of 
the summer are bloodier than ever. The topics don't seem unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
Films, still the most potent message-carriers around, seem to be fostering a 
greenhouse effect of violence. They're murderous, they present new, bigger, 
more insidious methods of killing people, they do well at the box office and 
they come back having to top themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the summer sequels -- "Licence to Kill," a "new" James Bond (the first 
not to have come from one of the books and the furthest in spirit from them), 
and "Lethal Weapon 2" -- appear hellbent on setting some new high-water mark in 
violent death and noisy destruction. "Batman," which gets to create its own 
precedents, adds a nasty twist to its brutality. And so the ante is upped 
everywhere along the line. 
</P>
<P>
The point about "Batman's" Joker is destruction and mutilation for the sheer 
joy of it. He lets the floodgates loose on savagery, Jack Nicholson's spurting 
energy pushing the amps higher and higher. The murderees are legion -- 
co-horts, girl friends, Gotham Cityites at random. When he goes on that 
slashing, paint-slashing rampage in a pretentiously named art museum, we're 
supposed to get the joke; smile indulgently because these are such frankly 
bogus copies of Old Masters, their very fakeness picked up by the museum's 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
But there are audiences who won't get the gag; all they'll pick up on is the 
glee with which Nicholson and his henchmen prance through that high-toned 
place, turning it into a heap of torn canvas and spray-painted walls. Why 
aren't the people who have been wringing their hands and worrying about the 
potential effects of "Do the Right Thing" concerned about a scene as 
seductively conducive to imitation as this one? 
</P>
<P>
The Bond film, which this time is a revenge vendetta on Bond's part for the 
mutilation (there's that subject again) of his close friend, dangles men over 
shark pits, indeed has them half-eaten and survive, and blows up others in 
decompression tanks, spattering the porthole windows with their blood. I 
suppose it's the usual crunch and desperation of every Bond film, but the tone 
is more extreme, more sadistic, the blood-letting more torrential. 
</P>
<P>
If these films weren't speaking to their audiences as viscerally as they are, 
they'd be laughable. "Lethal Weapon 2" is a joke of a story, a charade on the 
subject of apartheid held together by the enormous warmth and likability of Mel 
Gibson and Danny Glover, separately and especially together. But when the 
excesses of the action make audiences cheer instead of hoot, it's a thermometer 
reading, and that thermometer is going up as we sit here. 
</P>
<P>
Were the Lethal Weaponeers dealing in crimes that involved millions of dollars 
in the first film? You can feel film-making minds whirring frantically: OK, OK, 
this time we'll make it billions. Did people drop from buildings in the 
original? So this time, we'll drop whole buildings on them. Or entire cargo 
containers. 
</P>
<P>
If one of our heroes was strafed by machine-gun fire and left for dead before, 
now the villains blow up very nearly the entire Los Angeles police force's 
detective squad, at their homes, at their poker games, whoosh! 
</P>
<P>
Most disturbing of all is "Lethal Weapon 2's" simplistic lesson in political 
science: White South Africans are the new Nazis. All of them. Yes, we are told 
that the eminently hissible Joss Ackland is not the South African ambassador 
but their "Minister of Diplomatic Affairs." But to unsophisticated audiences, 
you can bet that he and his staff of blond, snarling henchmen personify white 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
And they are all sadists, with thick Boer accents, who sneer at "Kaffir-lovers" 
the way Helmut Dantine or Kurt Kruger used to sneer when Hollywood had real 
Nazis to characterize. To be sure, we have one "good" South African, 
</P>
<P>
a very sweet, white-blond, completely dim young woman who works at this 
non-embassy but doesn't exactly agree with her country's policies. Useless to 
ask why she then works for them. Agreed that it's getting harder and harder to 
find an all-purpose villain for movies these days, one whose constituencies 
won't be marching outside your theaters come opening day. It would seem that 
the atrocious and heart-rending practices of apartheid would make that 
government fair game. Unfortunately, life is not quite that simple. The people 
who have been ignored in "Lethal Weapon 2's" rush to fill us in politically are 
that core of white South Africans who have doggedly and at no slight personal 
risk been working for the rights of South Africans of color for years. (Books 
and newspapers aside, did no one see "A World Apart?") To ignore their very 
existence is insulting, at the least. 
</P>
<P>
In order to solidify our loathing of these bloody Boers, to make it personal as 
well as political, the film makers have gone back to the first movie and 
explained that the death of Mel Gibson's beloved but fortunately unseen wife 
was also a deliberate act by these very same mega-villains, drug traffickers as 
well as sadists. 
</P>
<P>
All this is to pave the way for the movie's unceasing vigilantism, to give 
Gibson free rein to invade the South Africans' official offices, rough up their 
goons, even shatter their tropical fish tank with rifle fire. (Fish have 
politics too?) And finally, to shoot their "Minister of Diplomatic Affairs" 
even as he holds up his card of diplomatic immunity. Why is that different from 
an American Embassy member showing his papers of immunity in, say, Tehran, and 
expecting the protection they provide? 
</P>
<P>
The point is that, trivial as it may seem to complain about a film like "Lethal 
Weapon 2," what is at issue are the principles of civilized behavior. By 
violating them -- no matter the provocation -- you weaken what separates us 
from governments we rightly deplore. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, in addition to frightening youngsters dramatically, a film like 
"Batman" teaches them that there is a kick that goes with destruction not 
unlike the rush of sniffing glue or a first hit of crack. 
</P>
<P>
What's most offensive about these formidably effective movies, however, is the 
way they trivialize life itself. If in a decade or so, we find ourselves in a 
society so de-based it is intolerable, we might look back to this summer as one 
of the signposts along the way.

UNDER TWO DIFFERENT SHADOWS OF THE APOCALYPSE;

COMPARING 'NEBRASKA,' 'WALK IN THE WOODS'

<TEXT>
<P>
There is a scene somewhere around the middle of Keith Reddin's "Nebraska" in 
which not one word is spoken. 
</P>
<P>
It happens when two military officers -- Swift and Fielding -- are on 24-hour 
duty in the hermetic launch center of a nuclear missile silo 70 feet 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
The lights go up. The men stare into space. Awkward minutes go by. Blackout. 
</P>
<P>
The scene speaks volumes. 
</P>
<P>
We've seen these guys there before. Alone together. Bored. Whiling away the 
suffocating tedium. We've also seen them earlier, in jest, rehearse the 
commands they'd have to execute to "enable" a successful launch. We know -- as 
they know -- that we're really talking about the possibility of nuclear 
annihilation. 
</P>
<P>
"Up there, who knows what's exactly going down," Fielding had said grandly over 
drinks one night to a bug-eyed army clerk he wanted to impress. "You gotta 
figure the worst." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything could be dust by now," echoed his buddy Swift, playing along. But 
something of that flippant bar-room banter lingered. One day on that stupefying 
duty in the pit, Swift asks Fielding, "Could you shoot me?" 
</P>
<P>
"Right now?" 
</P>
<P>
"Say I balk." 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
"Say I do." 
</P>
<P>
"Come on." Fielding is incredulous. Swift insists. "I get cold feet, you gonna 
train the metal on me?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course. And you would do the same." Would he? Some exchanges later the 
conversation is dropped. But the harm's been done. 
</P>
<P>
At the La Jolla Playhouse, where "Nebraska's" playing, we discover by degrees 
that no one on this forlorn base in the middle of nowhere is entirely rational. 
This business of baby-sitting rockets with the ability to pulverize 
civilization is not exactly life-enhancing. It provokes derangements. 
</P>
<P>
Swift, who entered the service because his father before him had proudly served 
as a career military officer, comes hard and slowly to the realization that 
this choice of profession may leave something to be desired, especially now 
that it has been nuclearly redefined. But not before he's done some things that 
don't add up -- such as asking Fielding the $64 question that puts his very 
fitness for the job on the line -- and straying from a rocky marriage (with the 
wife of his commanding officer, no less), a marriage he claims he wants to 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is he the only person on base with performance problems. Gurney, the CO, is 
so tied up in knots he can't even complete a sentence. Any sentence. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder his wife takes courses at the local college, visits bars and has 
affairs as recreational therapy. They are warning flares to a husband as 
inarticulate sexually as he is verbally. 
</P>
<P>
Reddin doesn't have to fill in the blanks. They speak to us loud and clear. By 
the time that wordless scene in the middle of the play comes around, we know 
exactly what is not being said. 
</P>
<P>
All of this strange behavior is not strictly the effect of living in the shadow 
of the Apocalypse. Like Lee Blessing's "A Walk in the Woods" (seen two years 
ago at La Jolla), Reddin's "Nebraska" is not directly concerned with nuclear 
deterrence (as is "Woods") but with the deadlier terms of a life lived in the 
negative mode. Dedication to making sure something doesn't happen, instead of 
making things happen, is a killer. It's "living" spelled backwards. 
</P>
<P>
Blessing's "Walk," a discourse for two voices, is much more forward-looking. 
This zestful series of private conversations between an American arms 
negotiator and his Soviet counterpart as they roam the woods outside Geneva is 
engaging, personal, surprising, amusing and garrulous. They discuss everything 
-- from Mickey Mouse and banjos and brown suits and the likelihood of 
friendship to country Western music and -- oh yes, alternatives to the arms 
race. Even its outdoor setting is life-embracing. It does get around to testing 
some knotty questions, but it is, in a phrase, all happy talk. 
</P>
<P>
"Nebraska," on the other hand, is all strained silences. Its messages are found 
between, not in the lines. 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly unusual when you consider the origins of the piece. Reddin 
had been asked to develop a documentary for PBS on nuclear weapons systems. It 
never materialized but the playwright was left with stacks of research material 
and "became interested in looking at the subject from a smaller angle." 
Documentaries are anathema to plays, but "Nebraska" director Les Waters' 
description of the final product as "Strindberg Meets Pacman" fits. Aside from 
a mutual reliance on humor, what links the plays is contrast -- the degree to 
which they demonstrate that you can achieve similar ends through diametrically 
opposite means. 
</P>
<P>
The loquacious "Woods" sparkles with accessible wit. It thrives on verbal left 
turns as well as the difference between the fledgling American, naively 
convinced that his diplomacy can make a difference, and the world-weary Soviet, 
droll and down-to-earth, who knows that political systems shift without really 
changing. (This argument may have lost some of its bite now that glasnost is 
pointing another way.) 
</P>
<P>
"Nebraska" is more chilling. Its fundamental proposition has a negative thrust 
-- and we're not talking missiles -- that ultimately implodes. It's attrition 
vs. nutrition. The ravages of such an existence are subtle. They do their worst 
almost imperceptibly. But it doesn't take a savant or even a psychologist to 
tell us that a perpetual death watch is murder on the elan vital. A skillful 
playwright will do. 
</P>
<P>
That is where "Nebraska" shines -- not so much as it unfolds scene after 
taciturn scene, in an understated episodic build, but in the power of its 
cumulative effect. Unlike the lip-smacking "Woods," which declares its 
intentions early and tackles them head on, "Nebraska" is all implication and 
sour aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
"Woods" comes sugarcoated. It is, therefore, much more of a crowd pleaser. Also 
a dream exercise for two actors. So it comes as no surprise that it was 
embraced for airing over PBS or that Des McAnuff, the artistic director at La 
Jolla who staged the original "Woods" (at the Yale Repertory, in La Jolla and 
in New York), has decided to mount two more versions of the piece next fall: In 
Moscow, with a pair of Soviet actors -- and in Vilnius, with a pair of 
Lithuanians. A perfect choice when you consider the play's portability, its 
dual nationality and topical appeal. 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that something as subtle and semaphoric as "Nebraska" would work 
particularly well on television which, as a medium, favors bolder and more 
declarative statements. And it's even less likely that it will find ready 
commercial markets. But a performance in the USSR or Lithuania would be an 
interesting idea -- in rep, perhaps, with "A Walk in the Woods"? 
</P>
<P>
Who is to say, on balance, if the play that says the least speaks the loudest? 
Or the other way around? There's virtue in both. What remains fascinating is 
the infinite variety of approaches to a subject.

MUSICIANS PLAY FOR SEVERAL OUTLETS BUT STRAINS INCREASE

James Thatcher sees himself as an independent businessman. The 38-year-old 
French-horn player has built a substantial studio career in addition to his 
work with the Pasadena and Pacific symphonies. "It's not uncommon for me to do 
a film in the morning and 'Ein Heldenleben' at night," he says. "There's no 
such thing as an ordinary week." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher is one member of Los Angeles' free-lance musician work force. Like the 
others, he may spend as much of his workday behind the wheel of his car as 
behind a music stand, but he relishes the variety of music the free-lance life 
provides. 
</P>
<P>
"The balance is wonderful," says violist Laura Kuennen. "I'm often tired, I'm 
often overworked, but I'm never bored." Kuennen has been here less than two 
years, after experiences with large orchestras in Rochester, Puerto Rico and 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
She adds that the combination of work available to her, "is probably possible 
only in Los Angeles. Free-lancing here is much more wide open than in New York 
-- New York is very tightly controlled." 
</P>
<P>
Consider -- if you are not subject to vertigo -- just some of the labyrinthine 
interrelationships among some local orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
The principal trumpeter of the Pasadena Symphony plays principal trumpet with 
the Pacific Symphony, the principal bassoonist of the Pacific Symphony is also 
principal for the Glendale Symphony, the principal cellist of the Glendale 
Symphony is co-principal of the Long Beach Symphony, the concertmaster of the 
Long Beach Symphony shares the post in the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and 
the whole viola section of the Chamber Orchestra is part of the Pasadena 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Throw in other community orchestras -- and there are 37 that have found it 
worthwhile to sign a master agreement with Musicians' Local 47 alone, not 
including ensembles in Long Beach and Orange County -- which employ many of 
these players as principals, and it should be clear that there are some very 
busy musicians in town. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly since these orchestras are not even the main source of income for 
many of these players. Local part-time orchestras are beneficiaries of the 
enormous pool of top-notch players drawn here by high-paying studio work. From 
these ranks come the key musicians who can make regional and community 
orchestras in the area sound like world-class ensembles, given the right 
conductors. 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, is the conventional wisdom, and it provided a fair picture of 
the way things were. A laissez-faire sort of non-system evolved that, horrors 
of scheduling aside, served both organizations and musicians well. 
</P>
<P>
But the system is changing under pressure from within and without the 
orchestras, as the groups themselves and the needs of the players change. 
Strain is showing as orchestras dive into the talent pool and hit bottom, and 
competition begins to color cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult, and it's getting more difficult all the time," Robert 
McMullin, executive director of the Pasadena Symphony, says of the effort to 
secure the services of the best free-lance players. "Los Angeles is becoming 
more and more an important center for the arts, and, as it happens, the core 
players -- the studio musicians -- are in greater and greater demand." 
</P>
<P>
Other orchestra administrators echo McMullin's plaint. Through close 
cooperation, though, they try to minimize scheduling conflicts, allowing their 
musicians as much freedom as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing that I think is positive," says McMullin, "is that there is a 
greater awareness among orchestra managers that we're going to have to 
cooperate. With that happening, we may be able to avert disaster." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make it as 'do-able' as possible by consulting with colleagues," 
says Mary Newkirk, general manager of the Long Beach Symphony. "We go out of 
our way to see that that happens. We exchange our schedules a year, two years, 
in advance." 
</P>
<P>
The players appreciate those efforts. "We're lucky to have good contractors and 
managers," says Susan Ranney, principal bassist for the Chamber Orchestra and 
the Pasadena Symphony. Last season, Pasadena and Music Center Opera (for which 
the Chamber Orchestra is the pit band) changed some rehearsals to ease the 
pressure of overlapping dates. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Scharf, the personnel manager for both the Long Beach Symphony and the 
Chamber Orchestra, says: "It's my job to see both ends of the issue of 
free-lancing." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to trying to juggle schedules, most orchestras also have a policy 
of allowing some absences. Flexibility, indeed, is the great virtue of the 
present free-market system, according to all managers. 
</P>
<P>
But Scharf warns that the future may be much more rigid. "I'm going to have to 
cut that flexibility," he says. In Long Beach during the last season, with its 
search for a music director, there were five rehearsals for each concert and 
musicians were allowed to miss one. Next season, however, the orchestra is 
going back to four rehearsals and players will find it harder to get out of 
any. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Symphony is also expanding its season. Also with full calendars 
are the Chamber Orchestra -- which augments its own busy season with 
engagements as the orchestra for the Music Center Opera, totaling more than 200 
services for the coming season -- and the Pacific Symphony -- which can offer 
its musicians engagements accompanying other organizations at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, such as the Pacific Chorale and visitors such as 
American Ballet Theatre. Both offer large numbers of concerts and rehearsal 
dates, with accompanying paychecks, to their players. 
</P>
<P>
The result of larger seasons is an increased pressure on players to commit 
themselves to the organizations and increased sense of competition for the 
players' services. 
</P>
<P>
"The players will bounce around from orchestra to orchestra, and its hard to 
get them to commit," acknowledges Scharf. "The expansion is not as much of a 
problem as that the younger players are getting older, more experienced and 
more in demand." 
</P>
<P>
"At a certain point, truthfully, we have to say, 'You have a commitment with 
us,' " says Deborah Rutter, executive director of the Chamber Orchestra, who 
points out that the commitment works two ways. "I've been here (with LACO) 2 
1/2 years, and this is the worst . . . and it's getting much worse." 
</P>
<P>
In a chicken-and-the-egg situation: The quest for key players is itself feeding 
the move toward longer seasons. Says Newkirk: "No question, it's going to be 
harder as all the orchestras grow. We want to compete for the best players. 
That's one of the factors that drives us to get back to a larger level of 
performances." 
</P>
<P>
Newkirk adds, however, that "I truly believe that the competition is not 
between orchestras -- who gets the best players or even subscribers' dollars -- 
but for people's time." 
</P>
<P>
The musicians express a mixture of worry and optimism about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"People on all ends have been very understanding," says Kuennen, a violist with 
the Chamber Orchestra, Long Beach Symphony and the New 20th-Century Players at 
CalArts, where she teaches. "How long they'll be able to keep that going, I 
don't know. I think everybody who employs free-lance musicians understands that 
if they put the screws to them too hard (to commit to any one organization), 
they're going to be the losers. They want to keep the talent pool happy." 
</P>
<P>
For all the understanding, good will and collegial consultation, there are 
still inevitable scheduling conflicts, which force some hard decisions on 
players and create curious coincidental anomalies. Kuennen, for example, is on 
the Pasadena roster but, she says, "I haven't played with them this season, 
because I've been too busy." 
</P>
<P>
When musicians must choose between orchestras -- as they will have to do more 
and more as seasons expand -- the choice is seldom made over money. Pay and 
benefits are almost the same per service, roughly $85 for concerts and $65 for 
rehearsals, in all of these orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the musicians pick the orchestra offering the most interesting 
repertory (or repertory with important solos for their instrument) and the most 
artistically and personally congenial people. On this point, nobody is more 
important than the conductor. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an inside joke among local per-service orchestra managers who depend 
upon hiring the best studio musicians," McMullin wrote in Symphony magazine. 
"If one orchestra aces another by providing more interesting or more 
remunerative work, the winning manager is liable to chortle condescendingly, 
'Isn't it wonderful that Los Angeles has so many good musicians to pick from?' 
Indeed it is wonderful, but getting first choice saves nerves and pleases 
conductors." 
</P>
<P>
That was made very clear in May, following Keith Clark's last concert as music 
director of the Pacific Symphony. He made public a letter blasting the 
orchestra management for allowing key players to miss rehearsals for Pasadena 
Symphony, Joffrey Ballet and recording dates. In response, Stewart Woodward, 
president of the Pacific Symphony board of directors, noted that this 
flexibility follows a traditional pattern and is part of the orchestra's 
agreement with its players. He also suggested that the players may have been 
expressing their own feelings about Clark by working elsewhere when he was 
conducting. 
</P>
<P>
Though reluctant to go on the record about their artistic preferences, several 
of the musicians interviewed for this story agreed that they made at least some 
of their decisions about where to play based on who was conducting. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Symphony was working under a new contract when Clark made his 
complaints. Before that incident, Louis Spisto, executive director of the 
orchestra, noted that "we do need to define excused absences." Otherwise, he 
said, "the new contract is working out well, with few hitches. This season 
we've offered tenure, guaranteed minimums and set procedures for auditions and 
termination. At the moment, we have a situation that is good for us and good 
for the players." 
</P>
<P>
There is some feeling, however, among rank-and-file section players in the 
larger orchestras, that what is good for the mobile first-desk musicians may 
not be good for the whole orchestra, something that union officials and 
musicians acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a fear from some of the section players that we don't want to 
see the orchestra grow, but that's not true," says Thatcher, principal 
French-horn player for the Pacific and Pasadena symphonies. "We don't want to 
see it become so stringent that you can't do anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Fleischer, president of Local 47, says that in contracts he likes to 
see, "the kind of flexibility that will allow those orchestras to retain their 
important players. The union's ends are labor ends, not artistic ends, but I 
think everyone's beginning to realize that playing together consistently makes 
the best orchestras." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to play more because we want to be better -- and that includes getting 
the best players," says Newkirk in Long Beach. "We never pay them enough, so 
we've got to offer them an artistic experience. I think the players would like 
to see us grow -- we would like to see us grow. We're very clear about where we 
are going and how we're going to get there. There is no dissatisfaction because 
everyone knows what the limits are." 
</P>
<P>
Even the players with the busiest outside schedules express strong feelings of 
professional pride and artistic satisfaction about their work in their multiple 
orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
"Every group I play in, plays really well," boasts Kuennen, while Thatcher 
says, "Another thing I like about the free-lance world is that everybody is 
always trying their best." 
</P>
<P>
The resultant quality of these orchestras, given strong artistic leadership, is 
high. There is a question, though, given the personnel duplication in major 
positions, whether there is a homogenizing effect. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's difficult," Mary Newkirk says. "I'm not sure many orchestras have 
their own sound anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly then, orchestra executives tend to look to their music 
directors for a distinctive artistic stamp, referring to a Jorge Mester sound 
in Pasadena, or an Iona Brown string sound at the Chamber Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
For some players, the insecurity of life without a regular salary is more 
apparent than real. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's so diversified, there's always something going on," says Susan 
Ranney, pointing out that many of these players flit from festival to festival 
during the summer as regularly as they commute between orchestras during the 
regular season. "It's becoming a year-round thing, being a free-lancer. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to have a steady job, but that isn't sufficient motivation to 
practice for an audition, where you are competing with college and conservatory 
kids who do nothing but practice all day." 
</P>
<P>
In a widely read -- and often debated -- speech the executive vice president of 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Ernest Fleischmann, proclaimed "The Orchestra Is 
Dead, Long Live the Community of Musicians." There he pointed to 
dissatisfaction, frustration and boredom among orchestra musicians, and 
recommended converting standard orchestras to flexible -- there's that word 
again -- communities of musicians, able to provide their members with an 
exciting, personally satisfying range of work. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the free-lance musicians, with experience in full-time orchestras, 
including the Philharmonic, would concur with Fleischmann in his portrayal of 
the often demoralizing effect of routine work in those ensembles. Not only may 
the repertory be standardized, but the players must work with the same people 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
Ranney says: "I'm very happy with what I do. Not only is it a combination of 
different types of music, but you see different people." As the mother of a 
small child, she adds: "Your time is your own." 
</P>
<P>
But she and her colleagues see the potential problems on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully it will all be worked out, though I don't know how," she says. "I 
think we all benefit from this, in the general health of all our minds."

LAGUNA NIGUEL ELITISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elitism is alive and well in Laguna Niguel as shown by Thom Taylor's fervent 
plea to restore the Pan Pacific Auditorium (Letters, July 9). What chutzpah for 
someone 30 to 40 miles away, completely insulated from about 10,000 daily 
automobile trips anticipated for this project by the Environmental Impact 
Report and the six intersections adjacent to the project, which are now at 
gridlock levels as well as the six additional intersections which would be 
raised to unbearable levels by this development. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's rhetoric is offensive to a community plagued by massive traffic 
problems and a dearth of parks and open space, which would be exacerbated by 
this so-called renovation. When he says (with no factual support) that "the 
significance of the Pan is far beyond detractors perceptions," he is slandering 
an entire community now cursed with the effects of uncontrolled development. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor naively says "the developer has stated the fire would actually give them 
a bit more latitude with the renovation plans, while respecting the historic 
fabric of the building in a dignified manner." To those of us who have seen the 
almost complete destruction caused by the fire and who know how little 
so-called "historic fabric" remains to be respected, the developers' reaction 
sounds like a self-serving statement by those who recognize a rare opportunity 
to further exploit scarce park land for commercial development.

GOOD SCHOOLS NOT JUST IN THE GOOD LOCATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert J. Bruss' urging of home buyers to investigate neighborhood schools 
before buying ("Location Important in Choosing Home," Real Estate Q and A, July 
16) may be sound, if obvious, real estate and financial advice. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bruss oversteps when he suggests that the quality of schools affects 
resales because "good families usually don't want to move where schools are not 
the best." While we don't know exactly what Bruss means by "good families" 
(wealthy? caring? smart investors?), his confusion of home buyers' virtue with 
their affluence is unmistakable and unseemly. 
</P>
<P>
Worst, is the inference that bad families are those who send their children to 
schools that are not the best. In fact, there is no difference in the concern 
that parents have for the quality of their children's education regardless of 
their affluence and/or neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors and parents alike need to guard against the kind of emotional 
redlining that rules out or endorses entire neighborhoods or school districts. 
</P>
<P>
While a fairly trustworthy, if regrettable, rule of thumb is that better 
schools are in more affluent neighborhoods, fine school programs may exist in 
areas that are not among realtors' first choices. 
</P>
<P>
Further, many schools in pricey neighborhoods fail to deliver educational 
programs that match their reputations. Expensive homes may inflate the 
impression of good schools just as good schools increase property values.

GARDEN OF THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The July 16 piece on xeriscape, "Beauty, Ease, Economy of Flower-Filled Dry 
Garden" by Robert Smaus, was an excellent description of what is possible in 
Southern California when one considers the oxymoron less is more. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Editor Smaus correctly predicts water shortages in the not-too-distant 
future. Those readers taking his advice now will have a mature, beautiful 
garden in place when water supplies become tighter. Few people realize that the 
average family in California uses about 163,000 gallons of water a year -- half 
of that outdoors where real savings can be achieved. Smaus has shown the way. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the sponsors of the xeriscape garden at the Los Angeles County 
Arboretum, Metropolitan Water District has long advocated a return to 
California native plants and imports from similar climates that use little 
water, yet burst with color or offer attractive ground cover. 
</P>
<P>
Your readers are invited to contact the Metropolitan Water District at P.O. Box 
54153, Los Angeles 90054, for free copies of colorful and informative brochures 
that will help them plan and maintain a drought-resistant garden. 
</P>
<P>
If just one-fourth of the families reading the Sunday Times takes Smaus' 
advice, the water savings would approach a staggering 14 
billion-gallons-per-year savings.

CONDO Q&amp;A: 'DICTATOR' MAKES THE DECISIONS FOR RESORT BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, Hickenbottom is president of the Greater Los Angeles 
chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), a national nonprofit 
research and educational organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I own property in a ski resort area in Northern California where most 
of the owners have other homes for their primary residence. Even though I am on 
the board of the homeowners association, a lot of decisions are being made by 
one of the board members (a full-time resident) acting on her own without prior 
board authorization. At each quarterly board meeting, we learn about more 
unauthorized decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Her decisions sometimes affect the level of comfort and enjoyment of our 
owners, such as the cancellation of contracts or services. Since a large number 
of owners are only here for short intervals, they are either unaware that this 
board member is acting alone or they feel powerless to stop her. Other board 
members either support her actions or do not wish to confront her since it 
hasn't helped in the past. By the way, she even controls the content of the 
minutes since she is the secretary. What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: A community association is supposed to be a democracy. In a democracy, 
people have the right to opt for non-participation. In the situation you 
describe, the democratic process is slipping because of this lack of 
participation, and your association is on the fast train to dictatorship -- and 
it isn't even the president who is the dictator! 
</P>
<P>
First, every board of directors should have directors' and officers' liability 
insurance. Many CC&amp;Rs (covenants, conditions and restrictions) require it. 
</P>
<P>
Second, you need to determine how much support you will have when you challenge 
"the dictator." If you do not have support from other board members and 
homeowners, you may want to resign in order to protect yourself from liability.

Remember that all board members may be liable for the mistakes of one board 
member, especially if those mistakes are challenged by an irate owner. If you 
decide that you want to continue to be on the board, you may want to consult 
your CC&amp;Rs to see if the documents specify how to remove an errant board 
member. If your association is incorporated, the California Nonprofit 
Corporation Code, Section 7222, also stipulates methods of removal. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, you should insist that the board meeting minutes reflect your 
disagreement with any action that has been taken without proper authority. You 
may want to consult an attorney. 
</P>

10-Year-Old CC&amp;Rs May Need Updating 
</P>
<P>
Q: I live in a condo development (149 units) in Oceanside. Ten years have gone 
by and we haven't revised our CC&amp;Rs. They reflect what the developers 
wanted. Since they are out of the picture, shouldn't our association make a 
complete revision? 
</P>
<P>
A committee has been formed to review the CC&amp;Rs and bylaws and make 
recommendations for revisions. I would appreciate learning about any literature 
or guidelines that would be helpful to us. 
</P>
<P>
A: After 10 years, your documents probably warrant a review and may need 
revision. If only a few sections require changes, I would urge you not to start 
over but to simply amend the portions that are outdated. 
</P>
<P>
Consult the California Civil Code, sections 1355 and 1356, that govern amending 
association documents. Seek the guidance of your association attorney before 
you begin, and rely upon the attorney for the actual wording of the amendments 
and the approval process. If member approval, notification and recording is not 
done properly, the amendments will likely be invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Community Associations Institute provides an information packet entitled 
"Amending Your Bylaws" that tells how other associations have successfully 
amended their bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
It is available from CAI at a cost of $10 for members or $15 for non-members. 
For a limited time, CAI will extend the member rate to Condo Q&amp;A readers. 
Just send your $10 check made out to CAI -- Greater L.A. Chapter, to this 
address: "Amending Your Bylaws," CAI, P.O. Box 84303, Los Angeles 90073. Allow 
four weeks for processing and mailing.

Furniture Paint Color Rule Termed Frivolous 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our condominium complex has just been painted white, and the board has 
issued a new set of rules and regulations, one of which specifies that all 
patio furniture must be white. However, this rule applies only to half the 
members whose private patios are visible from the street. Owners whose patios 
face the back (which includes all members of the board) have no color 
restriction for their patio furniture. How frivolous can a board be when making 
new rules? 
</P>
<P>
A: A board should never be frivolous. Your board probably thinks that this new 
rule is perfectly fine, but in your opinion their action is frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
Rules should always serve the common good and benefit the association. Here is 
what I recommend to boards that are contemplating adopting rules. The following 
questions should be considered: 
</P>
<P>
1. Is it the proposed rule legal? 
</P>
<P>
2. Does the board have the authority to adopt rules? 
</P>
<P>
3. Is the proposed rule needed? 
</P>
<P>
4. Is it reasonable and fair? 
</P>
<P>
5. Is it enforceable? 
</P>
<P>
If all these questions can be answered affirmatively, then, after deciding on 
the clear and concise wording of the rule, the board should notify the owners 
of the proposed rule. 
</P>
<P>
Then owners should be given an opportunity to give feedback to the board before 
the rule is adopted. The board should seek this input in order to remove 
opposition and build consensus. Many associations hold a hearing before 
adopting any new rule or policy. 
</P>
<P>
If the board votes to adopt the rule, abide by the legal documents' 
specifications for the notification of owners and residents. Be sure to provide 
ample notice and clearly state when the rule takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
Did your board make prudent decisions when adopting the "white patio furniture 
rule"? Did the owners have an opportunity to give their opinions about this 
rule? If not, the board may have a tough time enforcing it. If you cannot abide 
by this rule, request an open hearing where you and the rest of the unhappy 
owners can talk with the board about it. 
</P>

WEIGH FACTORS SUCH AS HEIGHT, SUITABILITY TO CLIMATE, EASE OF CARE AND 
APPEARANCE.

Choosing the best tree for your yard is a bit more complicated than just going 
to the nursery and buying whatever looks healthy and attractive. That cute 
little tree that looked so good in the container at the nursery may grow into a 
huge monster in a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
You can avoid problems that homeowners most frequently encounter by asking the 
following questions: Is this tree suited to our climate? When mature, will this 
tree be too large for my yard? Does this tree have destructive or invasive 
roots? Is this tree messy, dropping leaves, flowers or fruit? Is this tree 
susceptible to any diseases or insects? 
</P>
<P>
You will also have to decide if you would like an evergreen or a deciduous 
tree, which loses its leaves every autumn. One beautiful tree can increase the 
property value of your home significantly, as well as create a warmer, more 
inviting appearance. I always recommend choosing a tree you really like, rather 
than just purchasing whatever tree seems suitable for a particular area of your 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 trees listed below have proven to be ideally suited to home landscapes 
in Southern California. They were chosen for their outstanding beauty, ease of 
care and freedom from the common tree problems. 
</P>
<P>
RIVER TEA TREE: Melaleuca leucadendron. Usually multi-trunked, this evergreen 
grows to 25-30 feet tall. It is native to Australia and Papua New Guinea, has 
attractive white bark and soft foliage. A perfect-size tree, this Melaleuca 
doesn't get too big, stays relatively narrow, yet is large enough to serve as a 
dominant tree in a landscape. It can also be used as a screen (plant trees 6-8 
feet apart), or to create a woodsy backdrop in a small yard. It is drought 
tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
PEPPERMINT TREE: Agonis flexuosa. Another Australian native, it grows to 25-35 
feet tall and is hardy to 25 degrees. The leaves have a slight minty fragrance 
when crushed. Small, white flowers appear in spring to summer. With this tree 
you get the soft, delicate, weeping effect similar to a weeping willow, only 
the Agonis is evergreen, drought tolerant and stays small. 
</P>
<P>
EUROPEAN WHITE BIRCH: Betula alba. A favorite because of its lovely white bark 
and graceful appearance, the Birch is deciduous and grows to about 50 feet. 
Both male and female trees bear small, cone-like catkins. It is tolerant of all 
soil types, including soggy soils. 
</P>
<P>
QUEEN PALM: Arecastrum romanzoffianum. The Queen Palm is hard to resist with 
its elegant, feathery leaves. It is used in a wide array of landscape designs, 
and is particularly stunning with Spanish or Mediterranean style architecture. 
The Queen Palm is a rapid grower to about 50 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
SWEET GUM: Liquidambar styraciflua. This is the tree for spectacular full 
color. The Liqidambar has maple-like leaves and spiny, round fruit in winter, 
which will need to be raked occasionally. It is deciduous and grows to about 50 
feet tall. Plant in front of a south window to help cool the house in the 
summer and to remind you what season it is when fall arrives. Suitable for 
planting in a lawn, Liquidambars will tolerate lots of water or can go for 
weeks between waterings. Liquidambars are used extensively as street trees. 
</P>
<P>
EVERGREEN ELM: Ulmus parvifolia. This elm has a lovely weeping, arching form 
and grows to about 60 feet tall. A fine, large specimen tree, not overwhelming, 
which benefits from occasional pruning, especially when young. 
</P>
<P>
MIMOSA OR SILK TREE: Albizia julibrissin. The mimosa is deciduous and fast 
growing to about 30 feet, with arching branches that form an umbrella-like 
canopy. It has light-green, fern-like foliage and beautiful, showy pink flowers 
in summer. The variety 'Rosea' is the hardiest and has the brightest flowers. 
The flowers will drop and make a pink carpet; if planted over a patio you will 
need to sweep occasionally. I think the flowers are worth it. Mimosas thrive on 
summer heat and require ample water. 
</P>
<P>
STRAWBERRY TREE: Arbutus unedo. This handsome evergreen grows to about 30 feet 
tall, is drought tolerant and is ideal for small yards or as an accent tree. 
Compact forms make wonderful container trees in a patio or entry. 'Compacta' is 
a compact form. 'Elfin King' is even smaller, growing to a maximum of 5 feet. 
White flowers and red or yellow fruit appear in fall to winter. Fruit is edible 
but not very tasty. 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHERN MAGNOLIA: Magnolia grandiflora. This glossy evergreen is native to the 
southern United States and is prized for its huge, fragrant, 8-10 inch white 
flowers. The Southern Magnolia is tolerant of all soil types and grows to about 
80 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
The dwarf variety 'St. Mary's' grows to only 20 feet and has the same 
spectacular flowers. Some people complain about the litter of fallen leaves and 
seed pods; the good news is they only fall a few at a time, are large, stiff 
(leaves are almost plastic-like) and are thus quick and easy to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
JAPANESE BLACK PEAR: Pinus thunbergiana. A versatile pine, native to Japan, it 
grows to about 20 feet tall and is easily pruned to achieve different looks. It 
is often used for an Oriental effect, as a bonsai tree, or as a single specimen 
tree.

PROPER WATERING A KEY TO HEALTHIER PETUNIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ELLEN GUFFEY, Guffey is a free-lance writer living in Malibu. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They look pretty in nursery packs and catalogues, and they bloom profusely in 
Palm Springs, but why do they wilt in my garden? Petunias are perplexing, so I 
began asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Bodger of Bodger Seed Co. began my inquiry by describing the development of 
petunias from the small multiflora types in the '50s to the huge grandiflora 
blooms of the '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Breeders fueled the burgeoning bedding-plant industry with petunias that 
bloomed big and fast. But performance suffered. Bigger flowers didn't 
necessarily mean better plants. Enthusiasm for petunias waned. Impatiens, 
improved through hybridization into super-plants with long bloom and carefree 
culture, supplanted petunias as the most popular bedding flower. 
</P>
<P>
Then, according to Bodger, "the petunia industry fought back." Hybridizers 
concentrated on more dependable but smaller-flowered types -- the old-fashioned 
multiflora petunias that grew 3 feet tall but managed to bloom all summer 
without any help. The industry goal was to retain the small petunia's sturdy 
constitution and prolific production but create more compact plants. We saw 
such series as Joy, Comanche, Sugar Plum and Carpet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blooms Grew Larger 
</P>
<P>
Hybridizers continued their efforts in the 1980s. The newly designed multiflora 
petunias exhibited many of the excellent characteristics of the old 
multifloras, but the blooms were much larger -- so large that the name 
multiflora no longer seemed appropriate. So the petunia industry, like the rose 
growers, adopted a new generic description for this large-flowered but 
compact-growing class of petunias: floribunda. In this class, we find the 
popular Madness series (Summer Madness, Sheer Madness, Coral Madness, etc.). 
Surprisingly, the new floribunda blooms are almost as large as those of the 
modern grandifloras (including such series as Daddy, Supercascade, Flash and 
Supermagic), which are still the largest-selling of all petunia types. 
</P>
<P>
So where does that leave us petunia growers? In my garden the new floribundas 
are great in pots but in the ground they often wilt, along with the grandfloras 
and multifloras. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Vukelich Sr., chairman of the board of Color Spot, the largest wholesale 
nursery of bedding plants in the country, says that the immune system of the 
petunia isn't strong enough for moist climates. Petunias succumb to soil 
viruses. His advice: sterilize the soil. That suggestion brought to mind 
visions of Chloroxing my flower beds or fumigating them with Vapam, repugnant 
thoughts indeed, so I pressed him for other ideas. He recommended trying 
petunias in a different location. In moist climates, he advised placing them in 
spots where they receive sun for most of the day and good ventilation. Planting 
them between houses is risky. And watering is critical. With petunias, keep 
them on the dry side. 
</P>
<P>
Lili Singer, horticultural consultant and radio gardening authority agreed that 
petunia problems are water related. Petunias are subject to root and crown rot, 
a result of uneven watering. "Like pansies," she says, "petunias must never be 
allowed to wilt, either from under- or overwatering. Once they wilt, it's all 
over." She advises providing good soil conditions, including preparation with 
organic materials and ample mulching. When watering, do it thoroughly and then 
allow petunias to dry out -- almost to the wilting stage. That appears to be 
the tricky part -- knowing when they are sufficiently dried out. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Brozowski, color specialist at Sherman Gardens in Corona del Mar, says 
that petunias like it hot and dry. That's why they thrive in the desert. At 
Sherman Gardens, where she plants hundreds of petunias in a coastal climate, a 
liquid fungicide is sometimes used at planting time. But her principal concern, 
shared by our other authorities, is watering. She warns against watering on a 
schedule. Always check the soil; if it's damp, don't apply water. 
</P>
<P>
Water and soil fungi often attack petunias as soon as seedlings are 
transplanted into the ground. This is the time to be most vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
Petunias may develop tiny holes in their blooms, a sign that budworms are 
present. Geranium and petunia buds are especially attractive to small white 
moths that lay their eggs at night. These eggs hatch into tiny caterpillars. 
The best defense is handpicking of the little caterpillars or spraying with 
B.t., a nontoxic and long-lasting biological control. 
</P>
<P>
To keep my 40 pots of petunias blooming most of the summer, I feed regularly 
and attempt to remove faded blooms. My petunias in pots provide dependable 
color for at least 10 weeks before conking out. In the ground, they are a 
gamble, but hope springs eternal, and next year I'll try a sunnier location and 
keep a light hand on the hose.

SUMMER LAWN AND GARDEN MAINTENANCE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yards are at a point where, unless you are bringing in food from the garden, 
mowing the lawn and watering is about all you really need to do. By now you 
should have mulched everything and the amount of water you need to use is 
rather small, in spite of the heat. The lawn has had a light feeding so that it 
stays green but doesn't outgrow the borders between mowings. 
</P>
<P>
You've found that a watering that goes deep enough to throughly water the roots 
only needs to be done once a week or perhaps twice, if the temperatures stays 
in the 100s for too many days. 
</P>
<P>
A few of your plants are making great strides in growing although the majority 
of annuals are still plugging along. If they look tired, trim them. 
</P>
<P>
If the lawn has been played on a lot and the soil seems to be compacting so 
that water runs off rather than enters the ground, get the golfer in your 
family to wear cleated shoes as he walks around the yard.

HOT WEATHER CAN CAUSE LAWN TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hot weather can mean trouble for lawns. Good watering habits, like watering 
more deeply and less frequently, will make your lawn look better. Dry, brown 
spots or an entire unhealthy lawn can be caused by the lawn moth, packed soil, 
poor watering methods or fertilizer burn. 
</P>
<P>
Never fertilize wet grass because it is likely to cause burns, even when the 
correct amount is used. Find out from a certified nurseryman how to tell when 
your lawn needs water depending on the needs of your particular grass.

NEW EMPRESS APPLE SEMI-FIRM, SNAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new apple, described as semi-firm and snappy, with good color, texture and 
size, has been named Empress by Cornell University's New York Agricultural 
Experiment Station at Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
The apple, with a pedigree dating back 2 1/2 centuries, is reported similar in 
appearance and some characteristics to Empire, named in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
However, Empress ripens a month earlier, which is "a real plus," says Roger D. 
Way, professor emeritus at Cornell. "It means that quality New York State 
apples will be available to consumers well before many other varieties." 
</P>
<P>
The parents of Empress are Jonamac and the New Jersey-bred Vista Bella. Jonamac 
is a cross of the McIntosh and Jonathan. 
</P>
<P>
Way said:"Unlike many varieties that produce well every other year, Empress is 
an annual cropper with consistently good yield, And the apple is the product of 
a realtiely small tree, enabling growers to plant more trees per acre, thus 
increasing profits."

REARRANGE ITEMS FOR A FRESH, REDECORATED LOOK; 
</P>
<P>
A FEW INEXPENSIVE TOUCHES CAN MAKE A TIRED INTERIOR LOOK NEW, DIFFERENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Elizabeth Howard, national president of the American Society of Interior 
Designers, understands that many of us live with limited decorating budgets, 
have an affinity for clutter and a passion for collecting "interesting little 
objects." 
</P>
<P>
Like most interior designers, this Honolulu professional loves "big ticket" 
decorating -- splendid Hawaiian homes, luxurious clubs or hotels such as the 
Hana-Maui. But she also knows how to tame clutter and how to make the best of 
budget decorating. 
</P>
<P>
Her own home is an example. "Twelve years ago I bought an ordinary 1937 tract 
house with two bedrooms and one bathroom, and a view of Diamond Head from the 
deck." It works well for one person, and "I love everything in it, especially 
those things that remind me of the 17 places I lived while I was growing up. My 
father was in the military, so we moved often. 
</P>
<P>
"I love all those craft items and silly things that I have picked up in my 
travels and all those gifts from friends I have met along the way," she says. 
"I like having them out where I can enjoy them all together." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved the Furniture 
</P>
<P>
Recently, she felt the urge to do a little redecorating. So, she lightened the 
color of the carpet, re-upholstered some of the chairs and sofas, and moved a 
lot of furniture around. Some pieces she moved to other rooms, where they 
suddenly looked new and different to her. 
</P>
<P>
"Then," she says, "I took everything off my shelves and tables and put the 
whole lot in the middle of the room, and started putting it back together in an 
entirely new way." 
</P>
<P>
By the time she finished, "it all looked fresh . . . and I had rediscovered a 
lot of old friends among my possessions. This little exercise in rearrangement 
costs no money, just a day of time to work things over and reassess them. I 
retire some things for awhile and even throw or give some away. And of course I 
add new things from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
Our homes need change to be kept stimulating and interesting, she says. "So why 
shouldn't we move things around and gather them together in new ways?" 
</P>
<P>
Last year she decorated an $88,000 "affordable" starter house at the annual 
Parade of Homes sponsored by the Honolulu Board of Realtors. Since the rule of 
thumb is that a homeowner can spend between 5% and 10% of a home's purchase 
price for interior furnishings and decoration, her budget ran between $6,000 
and $7,000, retail. 
</P>
<P>
"I put that house together exactly like the move-in family might do it," she 
recalls. "I went to retail stores, hardware stores and shopped the Conran's 
mail-order catalogue. I went to store sales where I found dining chairs for $39 
each and close-out fabric for $1 a yard, and visited Salvation Army stores and 
went to swap meets." 
</P>
<P>
She turned a galvanized garbage can upside down to use for the base of the 
glass-topped dining table and hung up sheets of shiny aluminum Mylar on walls 
she couldn't afford to mirror. 
</P>
<P>
"What I proved," she says, "was that style doesn't have to be expensive. The 
job was a creative challenge to me, but the point I most wanted to make was 
that young families with limited funds have the option of engaging the counsel 
of a qualified interior designer, and then doing the shopping themselves. In 
this case, I acted as both the consultant designer and the budget-bound 
client." 
</P>
<P>
Many interior designers today, she emphasizes, have hourly or daily 
consultation fees which can provide people with a basic color scheme, a room 
layout plan, and general guidance on the right scale and appropriateness of 
things to be purchased. 
</P>
<P>
Hourly fees for this type of advice usually range from $25 to $100 an hour, 
with a national average among interior designers of $70 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
She advises people who opt for this consultation to do a lot of homework first: 
Think through their life style needs and their likes and dislikes on color, 
pattern, and style. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they have made all these determinations and have a concrete plan in 
hand," says Howard, most couples -- or singles -- can bring rooms together that 
have "a really cohesive look." 
</P>
<P>
As president of the 28,000-member interior designers society, Howard attends 
conferences, markets and meetings promoting the interests of interior 
designers. She is nurturing local-chapter projects that involve making homeless 
shelters more liveable and attractive, and setting up programs in leadership 
training and management skills. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we have to give back to our organizations and to society as a matter of 
personal growth and education," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I also tell interior designers that volunteerism can translate into more and 
better business."

KIDS OF THE BLACK HOLE;

<P>
THE 1970S WERE WANING WHEN ORANGE COUNTY'S PUNK ROCK SCENE ROARED ITS DARK, 
HOSTILE MESSAGE 
</P>

<P>
When the responsibilities of being a young father and the pressures of college 
course work begin to weigh on Frank Agnew, he sometimes finds himself taking 
the long way home. 
</P>
<P>
It leads him to a place from his past -- a nondescript, concrete apartment 
complex in a quiet neighborhood of Fullerton, across a narrow street from a 
schoolyard. Agnew, 24, will open the metal gate and walk through, satisfied to 
see that nothing at the place has changed, except for the child-proof fence 
that now surrounds the swimming pool. Then, standing beside a towering palm 
tree, Agnew's gaze will move to the right, to a screened door on the ground 
floor of this two-story horseshoe of apartments. Unit 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Black Hole. 
</P>
<P>
House of the filthy, house not a home 
</P>
<P>
 House of destruction where lurkers roamed 
</P>
<P>
 House that belonged to all the homeless kids, 
</P>
<P>
 Kids of the Black Hole. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely that local officialdom will ever approve a plaque for Unit 2, a 
marker to commemorate what was born there 10 years ago. Punk rock -- a distinct 
Orange County brand of punk rock -- sprang from the Black Hole in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Not only from there, but from back yards, garages, living rooms, warehouses and 
crash pads elsewhere in Orange County where musicians and fans gathered to 
share a raw, new kind of music and fashion that was faster, stranger, more 
overtly hostile and violently antagonistic to authority and established social 
norms than any previous form of pop-culture rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
For a small, shy, guitar-playing teen-ager such as Agnew, at 15 the youngest of 
the Black Hole denizens, Unit 2 was a place for fun and comradeship, for 
listening to records by such punk icons as the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and the 
Clash, from whom budding suburban punks could draw nourishment and inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, the Black Hole was a refuge where Agnew could hang out with 
fellow punkers and be free for a time from the ridicule and abuse that most of 
Orange County's punks were subjected to in those early punk days of 1979-80. In 
the high school halls and on the streets, a youthful minority bent on 
overturning prevailing norms of dress, music and social status often found that 
there was a price to be paid for being different. 
</P>
<P>
A punk's refuge was a parent's horror -- but few, if any, parents cared to take 
a close look into the tumultuous world chronicled in "Kids of the Black Hole," 
one of the benchmark songs about that scene. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Sex, drugs and fun is their only thought or care 
</P>
<P>
 Another swig of booze, another overnight affair. 
</P>
<P>
The song, written by Agnew's older brother, Rikk, stands as all the 
commemoration that the Black Hole needs, thanks to an explosive, relentlessly 
driving recording by the Adolescents, the band that included both Agnew 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
The Black Hole days of illicit experimentation and extremist fun ended with the 
punks' eviction in the spring of 1980; before they left, they wrecked the 
single-bedroom apartment in a vandalistic frenzy in which cabinets were torn 
from hinges, sinks were ripped from their moorings, and walls were kicked in 
and spray-painted with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 That night of destruction crystallized the dark side of punk: a mindlessness 
driven by the fury in the music and the youth of its fans and performers. 
Punk's mindless side gave rise to drug and alcohol abuse that would hamper more 
than a few of the county's punk rockers, and it fostered fan violence that 
would mar many shows and stigmatize punk as a musical movement. 
</P>
<P>
But the Orange County punks also founded their musical approach on high ideals. 
Punk was to be a source of creativity and originality, a forum for individual 
expression as well as an outlet for fun. 
</P>
<P>
For anyone who could yell lyrics into a microphone, or grind out a few chords 
on a guitar, punk rock offered a chance to speak one's piece and stand out from 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
But not just any old yelling would do. The best of the local punk rockers were 
musical diarists, using punk to sort through confusions, voice opinions, tell 
jokes, and vent angers and fears. After their first spark of rebelliousness 
flickered, many of those bands proved to have a staying power that carried them 
through personal and business problems and through the waning of a local punk 
club scene. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those teen-age punks of a decade ago are in their mid- to late 20s now 
(Rikk Agnew and Casey Royer, mainstays of the original Adolescents, are punk 
elders at 30). 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the Orange County punk rockers have gone from spouting rampant, 
firebrand rebellion to reflecting maturely on the consequences of past 
extremism, while drawing upon musical resources that allow them to go far 
beyond the old punk formula that called for an unrelenting sonic slab of hard, 
fast, assaultive sound. 
</P>
<P>
A surprising number of those original local punk bands are still going strong. 
While groups have splintered and lineups have changed, a roll call of the OC 
punk classes of 1978-80 finds Social Distortion, Agent Orange, T.S.O.L. (True 
Sounds of Liberty), the Crowd and the Vandals still answering the bell. (While 
the Adolescents recently broke up for the third time in their unstable history, 
the five original members are still fronting groups of their own or hatching 
plans for new bands). 
</P>
<P>
In what amounts to a music industry acknowledgement of punk's maturation, 
Social Distortion is about to record for Epic Records, making it the first band 
from the original Orange County punk rock movement to sign with a major label. 
</P>
<P>
The band is led, fittingly enough, by Mike Ness, the original kid of the Black 
Hole (Unit 2 was his apartment), whose career of brawling, boozing, and heroin 
addiction, followed by survival, maturation and thoughtful reflection, embodies 
the worst excesses and the finest achievements of Orange County punk. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny, affluent Orange County is not the sort of place one would expect to find 
any Black Holes, or any musical movement founded largely on alienation, 
discontent and angry rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
To Frank Agnew, it was "lack of companionship, lack of love, lack of 
relationship at home" that brought most of the kids of the Black Hole together 
in Fullerton. "It was a lack of attention, and they found it at the Black Hole. 
It had nothing to do with social stratification or social classes. It was all 
lack of a family. None of us had a close family. We were all each other's 
brothers and sisters, and we took care of each other." 
</P>
<P>
It is not unusual to find instances of family tension or divorce in the 
backgrounds of some of Orange County's most significant punk rock musicians. 
Mike Ness and Tony Montana, lead singer of the Adolescents, had particularly 
difficult upbringings marked by divorce and financial hardship -- and they 
became known as two of the most hard-core extremists of the early punk scene. 
</P>
<P>
But punk rockers' family histories also include homes that were stable and 
affluent, with parents who were supportive of, or at least not set against, a 
teen-ager's leap into punk. Punk certainly was a haven for kids who fit the 
alienated "problem child" profile, but it also had room for someone like James 
Levesque, longtime bassist of Agent Orange. As a sophomore at Placentia's El 
Dorado High School, Levesque was the starting quarterback of the varsity 
football team. By his junior year, he had given up football to become a punk 
rocker -- a development that Levesque said gladdened his mother. Pleased that 
she wouldn't have to worry any more about her son getting hurt on the football 
field, his mother was happy to pitch in and help do legwork to boost Agent 
Orange's following. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Soto, a founding member of both Agent Orange and the Adolescents, said it 
wasn't family woes that made him one of the Black Hole regulars. "I lived in a 
nice house, and my family treated me fairly," he said. "It wasn't rebellion 
against my parents or authority. It was just the state of music. I thought it 
was all really boring, and I wanted to be part of something more intense. I 
wanted something harder and faster. Any of my rebelliousness came from hating 
the (social) structure in high school. I didn't want to play music that those 
kind of people liked, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
That dissatisfaction with the mainstream rock music of the day -- the Journeys, 
Bostons, Bee Gees, Ted Nugents and Led Zeppelins who dominated radio and record 
sales -- is the common denominator linking the players and bands who shaped 
Orange County punk. Their rejection of mainstream rock had sweeping 
significance: It made punks see themselves -- and be seen -- as fundamentally 
different and set apart from the majority of their peers who liked the old 
standbys. The punks pledged their allegiance by adopting the short-haired, 
often outrageous look of Johnny Rotten, Sid Vicious, Billy Idol and the other 
stars of British punk. That made them instant outcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Their antagonists would be the jocks -- the football set -- or the long-haired 
hard-rock fans. There would be taunts, epithets, salvos of food and trash in 
high-school cafeterias. Sometimes there would be more than that. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, where many of the punks were big enough to fight back 
(T.S.O.L.'s members were all muscular, strapping surfers-turned-punk-rockers), 
these social differences often would be resolved with flying fists. 
</P>
<P>
"One group used to go out looking for people like myself, for the sole purpose 
of beating up people like myself," recalled Jan Ackermann, the Huntington Beach 
punk rocker who founded the Vandals. "They called our haircuts 'crop tops,' and 
they called themselves 'crop dusters.' I was always one step ahead of them." 
</P>
<P>
"Every party we went to there was a fight with people who didn't like the way 
we looked," said Mike Roche, T.S.O.L.'s bassist. "It was constant, and if you 
got caught somewhere alone, three jocks would hop out of a car and chase you 
and beat the (stuffing) out of you. I carried a Mace can in my pocket all the 
time, and sometimes I carried a blackjack. It was not a friendly time." 
</P>
<P>
Roche and others say that police routinely would stop punks on the street, 
photograph them and compile personal data on them for their file cards (the 
fact that some Huntington Beach punks liked to sport Nazi insignia for shock 
value hardly endeared them to the authorities or to the public). In one such 
stop, recalled Steve (Stevo) Jensen of the Vandals, police asked a punk 
nicknamed Joe Shmoe whether he had any scars or tattoos. "He pulled out a razor 
blade and slashed his chest, and said, 'Now I do.' " 
</P>
<P>
In Fullerton, where the punk rockers tended to be smaller in stature, 
discretion often proved the better part of valor in the face of abuse (one 
prominent exception was Mike Ness, who would fight every antagonist, even when 
it meant being overmatched and taking a beating). 
</P>
<P>
"I was a real timid person," recalled Frank Agnew. "I was small and skinny, 
5-3, 100 pounds, and I was dealing with the kinds of people you can't reason 
with. They had nothing upstairs, but they were big and burly. I'd say, 'OK, so 
I look silly. Just let me go my weird way.' Sometimes I was able to talk my way 
out of it without completely selling out." 
</P>
<P>
Agnew wound up dropping out of Fullerton High School, largely because of 
anti-punk harassment. Tony Montana was another who left school and earned an 
equivalency diploma rather than lead the life of a harassed social minority. 
</P>
<P>
"One time some guy on the swim team, he looked like a Marine, he had a bad 
attitude," said Montana, thinking back on his days as a frightfully scrawny and 
awkward-looking punk at Anaheim's Magnolia High School. "He started verbally 
harassing me, the usual thing, 'Punk fag, what's your problem?' So I mouthed 
off at him. He followed me and smashed my head into a pole, knocked me out 
cold. School was a place I could go for a good assault and battery. I wasn't 
safe there and I knew it. I never was a fighter. I had a mouth that wouldn't 
shut, and nothing to back it up." 
</P>
<P>
The punks had a way of assuaging the pain of taunts, cuts and bruises: They 
roared against their foes in songs such as the Adolescents' "Amoeba," a 
memorable anthem in which lyricist Casey Royer identified with "a one-celled 
thing (that) hardly knows it's alive." By the end of the song, though, the 
amoeba/punk is thinking, growing, surging into a higher state of being, ready 
to lash out at a scientist -- symbolic in the song of social authority -- who 
has dismissed it as an insignificant lab specimen. 
</P>
<P>
Opposed to social norms, and finding themselves opposed, Orange County punks 
were able to thrive. 
</P>
<P>
"People hated us," said Royer, "but we fed off it." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, though, it became apparent that the punks offered a form of musical 
excitement that substantial numbers of people craved. With no clubs booking 
punk at the start, the Orange County bands started on the grass-roots level, 
playing house parties. In Huntington Beach, the Crowd began playing back-yard 
parties in the spring of 1978, and built a solid following with a good-time 
brand of punk rock that kept the energy but eschewed the anger of most of the 
other Orange County punk bands (this good-time quality, and the fact that all 
but one of the band members were already out of high school, allowed the Crowd 
to escape much of the harassment suffered by other Huntington Beach punks). 
Among the Crowd fans watching closely from vantage points close to the stage 
were Mike Roche and Ron Emory, future T.S.O.L. founders who cite the Crowd as a 
significant influence. 
</P>
<P>
In Fullerton, the scene began to take shape early in 1979, when Agent Orange 
and Social Distortion played an eventful house party in Yorba Linda, thrown by 
two tiny twin sisters known as the Midget Twins. The Social Distortion lineup 
that night included Mike Ness, Casey Royer and Rikk Agnew -- the latter two 
both destined for the Adolescents. The singer was a 6-foot, 9-inch Cal State 
Fullerton varsity basketball player named Tom Corvin, whom Royer had befriended 
while working as a breakfast server at a student housing complex. The evening's 
highlight, however, was non-musical: Mike Ness was led off in handcuffs for 
spitting in the face of a plainclothes police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Huntington Beach punks, the Fullerton bands were taking some musical 
and fashion cues from the original British punks and from the Los Angeles 
punk-rock scene, led by such groups as X and the Germs, that had sprung up in 
1977. But the most immediate influences were close to home: bands like the 
Middle Class, the first Orange County punk group to make a splash in Los 
Angeles, and the Mechanics, a new-wave rock group that virtually every one of 
the Fullerton punks cites as an essential influence. 
</P>
<P>
Musical tastemakers in Los Angeles began to take note and dispel the prevailing 
canard that rockers behind "the Orange Curtain" were all rich, suburban kids 
whose punk efforts would, by definition, be fatuous. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Bingenheimer, whose weekly new-rock shows on KROQ were important in 
spreading punk through the Southland, would air demo tapes by bands including 
Agent Orange and the Adolescents. At the same time, a punk entrepreneur named 
Robbie Fields was combing those back-yard punk parties, seeking talent for his 
Posh Boy record label. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the kids in the suburbs had a greater feel for popular culture, and the 
popular culture that swept Orange County in 1978 to 1981 was punk," recalls 
Fields, who had lived in Anaheim as a child before moving to England. "In 
Hollywood, the people are coming from all over the country. They're coming 
starry-eyed, they're thinking about their career. You go to the suburbs and the 
kids aren't even thinking (about show-biz advancement). They could barely 
believe in 1980-81 that local music was being played on a real radio station 
like KROQ. It was fantasy land. Consequently, the music was totally 
uncalculated. Even though they might have been influenced by the Damned or the 
Clash or the Ramones, they were making their own statements, they were writing 
about their own lives." 
</P>
<P>
Fields was behind the first record releases of virtually all of the prominent 
Orange County bands. But most of them regard him now with bitterness, casting 
him, in the words of Rikk Agnew, as an opportunist "out with a mission to use 
all these naive kids to his advantage." Contractual disputes between Fields and 
Agent Orange led to a lawsuit that was settled out of court; T.S.O.L. also had 
a contractual conflict with Fields that climaxed when Jack Grisham, the band's 
volatile singer, punched Fields in the nose outside the Galaxy, a Fullerton 
roller rink where punk rock concerts were staged for a brief period. 
</P>
<P>
Those disputes have since been settled, Fields notes. "I gave them their start. 
Almost without exception, they recorded for me because there was no other 
avenue open to them. And if not for me, they wouldn't have made those 
recordings. They say I exploited them? Believe me, it was the other way 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Another key business figure in punk's emergence in Orange County was Jerry 
Roach, owner of the Cuckoo's Nest. The Costa Mesa club was Orange County's 
leading punk rock venue from 1978 until late 1981, when the club closed after a 
long court battle with the city. Much of the trouble arose from clashes outside 
the Cuckoo's Nest between punk rockers and the older patrons of two neighboring 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
"We had urban cowboys, construction workers and punkers, all next to each 
other," said Roach, who emerged as one of the few adult voices in Orange County 
-- albeit one with his own profit motive -- to defend the punks. "One of the 
big problems was what went on between these three different types of people. 
(The older punk antagonists) would apply hippie stereotypes. They'd think they 
could hassle them and they'd go, 'Peace, brother,' like the hippies did, and it 
would be cool. But the punks would get in their face. The punks would say, 'Hey 
cowboy, you look stupid.' The punks had numbers on their side, and these people 
resented them." 
</P>
<P>
With the Cuckoo's Nest packing in 600 or 700 people on peak nights -- far above 
legal capacity -- and with local bands also emerging as strong draws in Los 
Angeles, Orange County punk had its most flush period in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
But none of the bands was able to capitalize by building steadily upon early 
successes. With "Amoeba," the Adolescents scored a major local radio hit on 
KROQ at the end of 1980. Within nine months, the band was finished, torn apart 
by internal bickering and personal excess that were, indeed, adolescent. 
</P>
<P>
The key conflict arose between Rikk Agnew and Tony Montana. Agnew, 22 at the 
time, had harbored ambitions of rock stardom since boyhood, and wanted to take 
the band in a more accessible, less undisciplined direction. Montana, four 
years younger, hewed to a punk ethic that the music should remain an 
uncompromising, underground form, and that seeking wider success would mean 
selling out. Those internal tensions made for explosive performances on the 
band's superb debut album. But soon they exploded in the Adolescents' face. 
Rikk Agnew was kicked out of the band before the album's release in May, 1981, 
and further disputes between the remaining members spelled the end of the 
Adolescents by that August. 
</P>
<P>
T.S.O.L. was another early contender for success, emerging in 1981 and 1982 as 
one of the leading punk draws in Southern California. Eventually, though, the 
chameleonic band's chances were sidetracked by continual stylistic changes and 
internal dissension that broke up the original lineup in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"T.S.O.L. would play to 2,000 people, and major labels weren't interested in 
us," said Jack Grisham, T.S.O.L.'s original singer. "Maybe it was because of 
the bridges we burned, the violent, troublemaking image of the band. We were 
there, but the opportunity wasn't there. Punk wasn't acceptable then. If (a 
contemporary rock band) were headlining the Palladium and had 2,000 to 3,000 
people coming to the show, they'd be signed in a minute." 
</P>
<P>
Much worse than the career setbacks suffered by any one band was the fan 
violence that pervaded punk rock by the early 1980s. Most Orange County punks 
contend that early media coverage painted a sensationalized, violent picture of 
their scene. Consequently, they say, a substantial number of brawlers began to 
show up at concerts, attracted not by the music, but by the punk scene's 
violent media image. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the scene started getting a lot of publicity, all the losers found an 
excuse to go beat up on people," said Frank Agnew. "It had always been a 
peaceful scene. There (are) fights wherever there's booze, but it was nothing 
until the media flooded it, and these airheads would go, 'I want to be punk.' 
So they would cut their hair and go, 'Slam dancing, great, this is an excuse to 
go beat up on people.' That took over, and the violence destroyed much of the 
punk scene. Bands didn't want to play shows because they got sick of seeing 
their real fans beat up by these thugs." 
</P>
<P>
When Agent Orange released its fine debut album, "Living In Darkness," in 1981, 
the death of punk's promise was one of the record's main themes. The problem 
wasn't only fan violence, says Mike Palm, the trio's singer and main 
songwriter, but the calcification of punk into a uniformity of expectations and 
a rigidity of taste among many of its followers. 
</P>
<P>
Too many punkers insisted on the thrashing beats and hard-and-fast playing of 
the "hard-core" approach, while resisting the more melodic inventions of punk 
musicians who were expanding their tastes and discovering new musical resources 
as they matured. What's more, Palm said, he saw a number of his friends in punk 
wracked with personal problems that included heavy drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"By that time (of 'Living In Darkness'), it was basically ruined," Palm said. 
"All the fun had been drained out of it by then. It kind of divided into 
cliques. It was punk versus punk -- cannibalism. It was pointless. Originally, 
to be punk, you just had to have some ideas and get up and do it. It was all 
originality. Then it became, 'You gotta have a black leather jacket and dye 
your hair black.' It fell back into the very thing we were trying to get away 
from: stereotypes. There was also a lot of other stuff going around that wasn't 
healthy for a scene like that. There was a lot of drugs, a lot of alcohol. A 
lot of the people around me were really (messed) up. It started out as a 
healthy thing, and as it went on, everybody fell into the same rut. And it was 
pretty depressing, seeing your friends slide into drug addiction, alcoholism." 
</P>
<P>
By 1983, however, Agent Orange was singing an anthem called "It's Up To Me And 
You," that looked forward, in a chastened way, to new possibilities for a punk 
rock movement that Palm felt had hit bottom. 
</P>
<P>
We must improve by learning from the past 
</P>
<P>
 Creating something new 
</P>
<P>
 It's up to me and you 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 As the '80s have gone on, many of the original Orange County punks have proven 
themselves up to that challenge. 
</P>
<P>
* The Adolescents regrouped from 1986 to 1989, and, in a last hurrah, delivered 
"Balboa Fun Zone," a masterful, often elegiac album that spoke of surviving 
youthful excesses and coming to a more mature understanding. 
</P>
<P>
* Social Distortion, a band built on firm, longstanding friendships, survived 
Ness' heroin addiction (these days, after more than three years of sobriety, 
Ness frequents flea markets and swap meets rather than shooting galleries, 
pursuing a benign addiction to antique dolls and other knickknacks). Social 
Distortion re-emerged last year with "Prison Bound," only its second album in 
10 years. In it, Ness reflected on the consequences of the punk wildness he had 
celebrated in the band's 1983 album, "Mommy's Little Monster." Several tracks 
on "Prison Bound" -- especially the brilliant title song -- merged country 
influences with Social Distortion's trademark wall-of-guitars sound. The album 
displayed a promising ability to achieve depth through mythic, roots-rock 
shadings without sacrificing punk-infused energy. 
</P>
<P>
* T.S.O.L., down to only one original member, Mike Roche, is no longer a punk 
band, but it is striving honorably to bring some punk and blues-inspired grit 
and realism to the fantasy world of heavy metal. T.S.O.L. alumni Jack Grisham 
and Ron Emory also are still rocking and expect to emerge later this year with 
new albums by their respective bands, Tender Fury and Lunchbox. 
</P>
<P>
* Agent Orange, with only Mike Palm remaining from its original lineup, is 
still dogged by the internal and business disputes that Palm says have played a 
large part in limiting the band's output to only two albums in 10 years. But 
Palm says he has a strong backlog of material ready to be recorded when the 
logjam breaks. 
</P>
<P>
* The Crowd, reformed in 1987 after a four-year hiatus, has released a new 
album and continues to rock hard and prove that there is punk life after 30. 
</P>
<P>
* The Vandals, like that figurative punk amoeba, have split in two. One lineup 
is due back soon from a summer tour of Europe. It will arrive to find another 
group of recently revived Vandals that features Stevo, the satiric punk band's 
original singer, and founding guitarist Jan Ackermann. 
</P>
<P>
* Of the ex-Adolescents, Casey Royer continues in his longtime slot as leader 
and front man of D.I., championing the sonic-boom sound of the early 
Adolescents. Steve Soto is preparing to launch a new band, Joyride, while the 
Agnew brothers are woodshedding on separate projects. Rikk Agnew still harbors 
his old rock-star ambitions while, at 30, acknowledging for the first time that 
it might be prudent to have a steady day job as a fallback position. Frank 
Agnew, a husband and father of two, aims to complete a college degree in 
communications, positioning himself for a film or entertainment business career 
in case his continuing rock music efforts don't pan out. Tony Montana, who has 
lived in Los Angeles County since 1981, continues to sing dark, hard-edged punk 
with the Flower Leperds. 
</P>
<P>
Few, if any of these musicians have ever earned a full living from music. Yet, 
albums by the Adolescents, T.S.O.L., Agent Orange and Social Distortion have 
sold 40,000 to 50,000 copies or more, according to band managers and record 
companies -- strong figures for albums on small, independent labels. Many of 
the early punk recordings continue to sell steadily to a new generation of 
teen-age fans, the labels report. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, some of the punks have shown the capacity to grow in their lives 
outside of music. The biggest surprise of all may be Tony Montana's new career: 
When he isn't ranting about the dangers of the world with his band, this 
one-time hellhound of the Orange County punk scene teaches students who are 
emotionally, mentally or physically disabled at public schools in the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
It's a far cry from the days when Montana, now 26, would pull such antics as 
deliberately flopping face-first on stage, without breaking his fall, or taking 
out his displeasure with the Adolescents' recording process by spraying the 
studio with a fire extinguisher. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all fighting and yelling, and they wanted to kill Tony," recalled 
Lisa Fancher, who, as owner of Frontier Records, had the chore of baby-sitting 
the Adolescents while they recorded for her label. "Now I like him a lot, but 
at the time he was an insufferable little turd. On that album, he just summoned 
up the total anger and fury that he felt." 
</P>
<P>
Montana's constructive new civilian life -- which he says is by far a greater 
priority than his continuing musical career -- comes as a particular surprise 
to Jerry Roach, who always saw the Adolescents' singer as the epitome of punk 
rock recalcitrance. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony, the singer, he really lived the punk-rock world," Roach recalls. "He 
really tried to be a punk more than anyone else. He was so down. But that 
proves it. This horrible little punk rocker -- and believe me, he was the most 
horrible of them all -- and he's grown up to be a schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
"I always used to say that these horrible punk rockers would grow up to be 
decent citizens." 
</P>

<P>
 -- "Living in the Future" 
</P>
<P>
by John Prine, 1981 
</P>
<P>
When I was in grade school in the late '50s and early '60s, scientists seemed 
like gods and the idea of a future based on nuclear power was virtually a 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
My friends and I wanted to be rocket scientists or astronauts when we grew up 
and we eagerly anticipated the day that miniaturized atomic engines would allow 
us to cut the umbilical cord connecting automobiles to the gasoline pump. 
</P>
<P>
In our eyes, at least, there was little of the mixed blessings awaiting us in 
the future that singer-songwriter John Prine so cleverly pointed up. 
</P>
<P>
Every now and then I wonder what kind of image of the future kids must have 
today in the wake of devilish disasters with Three Mile Island, the space 
shuttle Challenger, the Stringfellow acid pits and terrifyingly too many 
others. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibit at the Fullerton Museum Center addresses that very question through 
youthful imaginings that are occasionally disturbing, but mostly charmingly 
wacky. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, which closes today (a week earlier than planned to make way for a 
show from the Smithsonian that opens next month), is entitled "Document Orange 
County, Part 3" and is paired with "Looking Forward," a show featuring 
futuristic adult visions supplied by members of New York's American Institute 
of Graphic Arts. 
</P>
<P>
There are a couple of interesting entries among the graphic artists' show, but 
for the most part, these posters and magazine or newspaper illustrations often 
only loosely conjure images of the future. 
</P>
<P>
It was the kids' section that most intrigued me, perhaps because I still carry 
one dark memory out of all those duck-and-cover civil-defense drills that 
supposedly were preparing us to survive nuclear war: the fear that I'd never 
live long enough to die of old age. 
</P>
<P>
As Albert Einstein observed, in a quote used on one of the AIGA posters: "The 
unleashed power of the atom has changed everything except our modes of 
thinking, and thus we drift toward unparalleled catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
What do you suppose today's kids, who may retain visions of Chernobyl, of 
rockets' red glare and the space shuttle bursting in air, imagine life will be 
like when (and if) they reach adulthood? 
</P>
<P>
For a surprisingly large number, technology still appears to represent a kind 
of savior, as it has to people throughout the 20th Century. Robots and other 
clever machines will deliver kids of the future, if not from evil, at least 
from the horrors of homework and washing the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Few imagine devices to eliminate poverty, hunger or disease. Most are far more 
pragmatic. 
</P>
<P>
My vote for Invention Most Likely to Succeed goes to fourth-grader Phoenix 
Sanchez for his "Computer Mug." 
</P>
<P>
"The computer mug will be used for drinking coffee and doing work at the same 
time." Think of the time-wasting trips to the coffee machine that will save. 
"It will come with a handle for transporting it easily to work or to school. It 
will come in all the rainbow colors. It will cost about twice as much as a 
plain coffee mug." C'mon -- it'd be a bargain at thrice the price. "It will be 
used for art projects, homework and games." 
</P>
<P>
Wait till the Ronco folks get hold of that one. 
</P>
<P>
Two entries predict resurgences of fashions from the past. In 2189, writes 
fifth-grader Melissa Merrell, "children and adults will wear long dresses and 
suits like were worn in the year 1889, because fashion repeats itself." 
Fortunately for our descendants, none of these kids is figuring on a big 
comeback for bell bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton fifth-grader Greg Baines envisions the nuclear-tinted house of the 
future: "The dark squares in my drawing represent the rooms where our faces 
will glow in the dark in order to save on electricity." 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, we will make contact with extraterrestrials in the world of 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying a picture of a creature that looks like a man with a head 
resembling a two-slice toaster, fifth-grader Jim Freeman says: "U.S. astronauts 
will discover this alien on Mars. They will find out that he is human in some 
ways." In other words, he's not a lawyer. "He also has alien features, for 
instance, his eyes and mouth and three fingers are very alien. He has a badge 
indicating he is Captain of Mars." Sort of the Joe Friday of the Red Planet. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, a few signs that not everything will be rosy in the year 
2525. 
</P>
<P>
As explanation for her city in the sky, Kerri Devonald expects that "the world 
will explode before the year 2489, so everything will be up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Angelina Gonzalez, another fifth-grader, put together an illustration that she 
describes thusly: "My picture is of a spaceship going up in the air. A man is 
looking out of the spaceship, and he looks a bit scared." 
</P>
<P>
Under a computer-generated picture called "The Kid Robot," one fifth-grader 
painted a psychologically revealing analogy of the model child-student as 
automaton: "My robot is very intelligent. She can do any problem on your 
homework. She is programmed to clean rooms, wash dishes and any other chore you 
could ask her to do. . . . She looks like a human being, but she's not." 
</P>
<P>
When asked to describe what Orange County will look like in the future, most 
kids drew pictures including vehicles that will be able, in one student's 
words, to "fly through the air with the greatest of ease." Obviously they've 
spent some time on the Santa Ana freeway. 
</P>
<P>
And some of us can find reassurance in knowing that at some point, as pictured 
in one drawing, Orange County apparently will be defended by a giant walking a 
tightrope shaking his fist (or is he throwing punches?) at low-flying planes. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the houses that will occupy the county in years hence have windows 
emblazoned with dollar signs. Are they all banks, reflecting the county's 
affluence? Or are they an indication that kids are aware of the astronomic cost 
of housing that will price most of them into futuristic suburbs somewhere 
outside Fontana? 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, one image of Orange County's future that stands apart from 
the rest: a picture of green hills and flowers and a rainbow and a blue sky and 
a shining sun. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what kind of student drew this one, but I'll predict that this kid 
may have the brightest future of all. At the Orange County Chamber of Commerce.

Revenge was on Sen. Marian Bergeson's mind as she walked out, shellshocked and 
grim-faced, after a defeat in a committee hearing chaired by Assemblyman 
Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose). 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach Republican convened her own Senate Local Government Committee 
two hours later and killed two of Cortese's bills by calling for a vote when 
too few senators were in the room to support the measure. Then, in a rare 
procedural twist, she persuaded her Senate colleagues to reconsider a Cortese 
bill approved by her committee just that morning so she could switch her "aye" 
vote to "no," personally scuttling that measure too. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for Bergeson's pique: Cortese put Orange County's half-cent jail tax 
bill on hold. 
</P>
<P>
Touted by Orange County officials as their best hope to solve jail overcrowding 
problems, Bergeson's bill would allow the county to ask voters in June, 1990, 
to approve a half-cent-per-dollar sales tax increase aimed at financing 
construction of new adult and juvenile detention facilities, as well as 
additional courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by voters, the tax increase would produce an extra $121 million a 
year, crucial seed money for the planned 6,000-bed Gypsum Canyon jail that is 
projected to cost $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Brad Gates said he figures the proposed sales tax hike would cost the 
average Orange County family $50 to $75 a year. That, Gates contends, is a 
small price to pay to keep an estimated 50,000 criminals a year from being 
prematurely released to Orange County streets. 
</P>
<P>
But those kinds of gut-level arguments have failed to impress lawmakers or 
erase the political and legal questions surrounding the Orange County measure, 
not the least of which is whether the proposal is legal under Proposition 13, 
the landmark tax limitation measure passed by Californians in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge invalidated a similar jail construction sales tax 
enacted by San Diego County voters because the county supervisors would control 
the revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled if that county's supervisors hold the purse strings, such a 
special tax requires approval of two-thirds of the voters. If a separate agency 
not controlled by the supervisors was in charge, the tax could be enacted by a 
simple majority, which is what the San Diego sales tax measure won at the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
Despite amendments to the bill to cure any similar flaws in the Orange County 
sales tax measure, that legal decision was cited as one of the reasons Cortese 
on Wednesday asked his Assembly Local Government Committee to postpone a vote 
on the measure for at least a month of study -- a delay that angered Bergeson 
and prompted her retaliatory actions against his bills regarding growth 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem for the Orange County sales tax measure is timing. 
</P>
<P>
While it is certainly of paramount importance to Orange County residents, it is 
only one of seven "urgent" sales tax proposals before the state lawmakers this 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Five of them would ask voters to increase local sales taxes to finance jail 
construction in Orange, Riverside, Los Angeles, Ventura and Humboldt counties. 
Bergeson, herself, is carrying the bill for Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The two other bills would allow communities around the state to add sales taxes 
to pay for everything from police services to local improvements such as 
streets, sewers and schools. 
</P>
<P>
Cortese contends that the spate of sales tax bills is a problem because each 
measure is written differently. The resulting hodgepodge stands a good chance 
of being rejected at the last minute by Gov. George Deukmejian, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can imagine him saying, 'Hey guys, give me one bill that makes sense,' " 
Cortese said. 
</P>
<P>
The assemblyman said that to forestall that possibility, he wants his committee 
staff to see if there is a way to streamline and combine all the measures into 
one sales tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legality In Question 
</P>
<P>
Yet the legality question surrounding the Orange County sales tax measure, as 
well as its legislative siblings, remains. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 says that before a local government, such as a county board of 
supervisors, can impose a tax for a special purpose, such as building jails, it 
first must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the affected voters. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Orange County officials could take that route without the aid of 
Bergeson's bill. The Board of Supervisors could call a bond election to pay for 
the new jail through an increase in property taxes, said Richard Keefe, the 
county's manager for intergovernmental relations. But it is considered very 
difficult to get a two-thirds majority at the polls, especially for a tax 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying they won't" hold a bond election, Keefe said. "That's a 
possible tool for our Board of Supervisors, (but) the reluctance to do that is 
based upon the dismal record of any kind of (tax) proposal submitted to the 
electorate by any agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to get the two-thirds approval," Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson's bill would require only a simple majority approval for the sales 
tax, a distinct advantage for Orange County officials who are gearing up to 
campaign for the measure locally. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the money raised by the proposed half-cent-per-dollar sales tax 
would not go to the county, but to a new government agency called the Orange 
County Regional Justice Facilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Independent of County 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson and her supporters argue that the new agency would be independent of 
the county because only two of its five board members will be county 
supervisors, who, therefore, could not control decisions of the committee. (Two 
other members would be elected officials from Orange County cities, and the 
fifth would be a public member chosen by the other four.) 
</P>
<P>
As such, they contend, the new body should be treated just like the Orange 
County Transportation Commission, which by law only needs a majority vote to 
impose a sales tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of the plan say that distinction still won't be enough to stave off 
a court challenge of the Orange County jail tax proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The new agency's function is to build jails and courthouses, traditionally the 
county's job. While it could theoretically make independent decisions on how to 
spend the sales tax money, the agency was created primarily to help fund a new 
county jail and courthouse. And Bergeson's bill still calls for county 
supervisors to make a final decision on how and where a detention facility 
would be built. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're going to have a difficult time going to court with a straight 
face and saying, 'Yeah, this is a legitimate agency formed with another purpose 
other than evading Proposition 13,' " said Thomas Homann, one of the attorneys 
who successfully challenged the San Diego jail construction sales tax. "I don't 
see them winning." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Mention of Commission 
</P>
<P>
Critics also note that when it was introduced on March 9, there was no mention 
of an independent commission. The bill originally allowed the Orange County 
supervisors, through a special taxing district, to collect the money as well as 
spend it. 
</P>
<P>
But after a Riverside Superior Court Judge ruled March 24 that a similar 
proposal in San Diego County was unconstitutional, Bergeson and attorneys for 
the county scrambled to rewrite the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego jail construction tax, approved last year by 50.8% of the voters, 
funneled the money indirectly to the county through a new agency called the San 
Diego Regional Justice Facility Financing Agency. But Judge Gordon R. Burkhart 
ruled that the agency was so closely aligned with the San Diego County Board of 
Supervisors that it was an "alter ego" of county government. 
</P>
<P>
Burkhart also overturned the San Diego sales tax measure, saying it "purposely 
circumvented" the two-thirds provision for a special tax under Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
"The court finds that the tax here is placed in the . . . treasury and was not 
to be spent for any general purpose the county wishes but rather must be spent 
for the special purposes of constructing and operating justice facilities," 
Burkhart wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bill Amended 
</P>
<P>
On May 12, Orange County supervisors voted to relinquish control of the 
proposed Gypsum Canyon jail to a new government agency. On July 5, the Bergeson 
bill was amended with language creating the independent Orange County Regional 
Justice Facilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Critics such as Homann contend that such efforts, coming after the judge's 
ruling, could help bolster a charge that the county is trying to do an end-run 
around Proposition 13 with its sales tax. Even one of the measure's supporters, 
who asked not to be identified, admitted privately last week that the move by 
the county was a "strategic error." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Bergeson said she intends to continue pushing the sales tax proposal, 
despite these questions, because it is the "best option" open to Orange County 
officials, who have been under federal court pressure to relieve overcrowding 
in jail facilities. She noted, too, that the San Diego case could still be 
overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be action taken," Bergeson said. "The county is almost at a point 
of desperation in finding a mechanism . . . to comply with an issue that is a 
health and safety matter. It's literally a crisis as a result of releasing 
prisoners, arrestees, back onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the fact that they (the county) are willing to go forward right now, 
even with the San Diego case, highlights the need." 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who has already organized an informational campaign to persuade voters 
to pass the sales tax, said emphatically that Orange County's proposal is not 
designed to circumvent Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sick and Tired' 
</P>
<P>
"I get sick and tired of people who complain about these kind of things but 
don't step forward with a recommendation or a solution to the problem," Gates 
said of critics of the sales tax plan. 
</P>
<P>
But in delaying action on the Orange County bill for further study, Cortese 
said he is trying to make sure the sales tax solution doesn't create more 
problems. He predicted that if the Legislature passes the Bergeson bill in its 
present form, its chance of surviving a court challenge is "almost nil." 
</P>
<P>
Cortese spoke gingerly when asked if the Orange County plan was an effort to 
get around the limitations imposed by Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Orange County officials) are not supposed to say that, and I'm not 
supposed to say that, either. They would obviously be letting the cat out of 
the bag. If they said it, it would go on record as their motive and it would 
ruin their whole effort overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say it either." 
</P>
<P>
But maybe with minor modifications over the next month, the sales tax measure's 
odds of withstanding a court challenge can be improved. "At least they will be 
50-50," Cortese said.

SOS BACKLASH TYPIFIES REACTION TO COMMUNITY-BASED AID CENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Diane Lee steps out of her Costa Mesa home at night, she carries a 
baseball bat. The family bought a dog to keep potential intruders at bay. Her 
two grown daughters can no longer run safely in the park near their home, she 
says, and she frequently washes urine and excrement from her fences. 
</P>
<P>
The problems, she says, have grown in direct proportion to the growth of her 
longtime neighbor, Share Our Selves, a group which provides food, clothing and 
medical assistance to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
"The more people that came (to SOS), the more undesirable people that came," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Her sentiments and those of some of her neighbors have not been ignored. Last 
week the Costa Mesa City Council refused to renew a lease for SOS at a 
neighborhood community center, giving the group six months to either find a new 
location or end its programs. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over SOS points to a thorny issue facing many communities over what 
responsibilities they shoulder for the needy in their midst. More and more, 
communities are rejecting groups and programs that cater to a variety of social 
needs, social welfare officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the needy say it is a troubling trend because it perpetuates 
stereotypes and makes it more difficult to deal with social problems that 
already seem intractable. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "NIMBY" sentiment ("not in my back yard") "is a problem 
everywhere anybody tries to institute change. It is a natural reaction," said 
Larry Leamon, County Social Services Agency director. 
</P>
<P>
Leamon's agency has been in a running -- and so far unsuccessful -- battle with 
Fullerton City Hall to open a welfare office in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Business owners in the semi-industrial area near the proposed site have spoken 
out against the office, and both the Planning Commission and City Council have 
turned down permit requests. 
</P>
<P>
"Potential neighbors spoke in unanimity against our occupancy, and one of the 
stated reasons was concern about 'those' people,' " Leamon said. "But there 
were other concerns about things like traffic flow. We are working with our 
potential landlord to redesign the project and will resubmit the package to the 
city this fall. Then it will be a clear test of whether 'NIMBY' is what is 
really going on." 
</P>
<P>
Instances of so-called "do-gooder backlash" have cropped up all around the 
country and have hindered politically savvy, well-connected and reputable 
programs, social welfare advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, for example, former First Lady Nancy Reagan 
withdrew support for a $10-million drug treatment center that was to bear her 
name after intense pressure was applied by neighbors, who complained that the 
facility would lower property values and attract crime and drugs to their 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County: 
</P>
<P>
* The Center for Creative Alternatives, which offers drug- and alcohol-abuse 
counseling and provides emotional health services, was recently denied 
permission by the Huntington Beach Planning Commission to move to a new 
location in its same neighborhood after neighbors complained. 
</P>
<P>
* Irvine officials scrapped plans to convert part of an animal shelter into 
temporary housing for the homeless after residents questioned the 
appropriateness of the shelter and argued that it would lure derelicts to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
* The Episcopal Service Alliance, trying to open a shelter for homeless women 
in Orange, was turned down by that city's Planning Commission, but given 
permission by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
* When the Episcopal Service Alliance recently opened an office serving the 
homeless mentally ill in Laguna Beach, it received a firebombing threat. 
</P>
<P>
* In Santa Ana, a group of business owners and residents is urging that the 
county welfare office and the Orange County Rescue Mission be moved from its 
neighborhood, alleging that the facilities have acted as a magnet for 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Karol W. Vanzant, a Santa Ana business owner, said he has watched his block 
become a haven for "bums, drug abusers, panhandlers and transients" in the six 
years the rescue mission has been in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"One day you don't have a problem, and the next day you do. It's like turning a 
light switch on," Vanzant said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not conducive to business and has cost me literally thousands of 
dollars. . . . It's scary for women. (Welfare and mission clients) call you 
names, harass you and threaten you if you don't give them something. This area 
has become known as a free zone." 
</P>
<P>
Vanzant said that people attracted to the rescue mission are not truly needy 
and that groups donating food and clothing to them are misguided. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see those that want help get it, but I am against the 
proliferation of drug and alcohol abusers. They have to want to change, and 
these people don't want to change. The do-gooder groups have to understand the 
effect (helping them) has on the rest of society." 
</P>
<P>
Vanzant referred to a survey by police of 28 people in and around Center Park 
near the rescue mission. Police found that about 85% had criminal records for 
such crimes as burglary, theft, drug sales and public drunkenness. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Police Lt. Bruce Carlson said the area, just west of downtown, has a 
high crime rate, though not the highest in the city. "It is a very small 
survey, and whether you can connect these people to the rescue mission or any 
other organization is unknown," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Lands, executive director of the rescue mission, agreed that some of 
Vanzant's concerns are legitimate, but disputed his characterization of most 
rescue-mission clients. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Mather, chairman of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force, said 
views like Vanzant's and Lee's stem from common myths and misperceptions about 
the homeless and needy. 
</P>
<P>
A survey by the California Homeless Coalition, which Mather also chairs, listed 
the five most common fears that spring up in a neighborhood where services for 
the poor are provided: increased crime, urination in public, a decline in 
property values, attraction of undesirable people and molestation of children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to deal with these perceptions," Mather said. "It's a myth, 
like alligators in the sewers of New York. It becomes visceral, tied up in 
emotion, and people put up a siege mentality." 
</P>
<P>
He said members of SOS went to the Costa Mesa City Council meeting with figures 
demonstrating that property values in SOS' west side neighborhood had not 
declined and that the crime rate had not increased. Costa Mesa police have 
repeatedly contradicted claims that SOS has attracted criminals to the area. 
</P>
<P>
But Diane Lee says her fear is real. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be able to walk freely in this neighborhood," she said. "There 
needs to be a place where all social service groups can be put together, 
outside of a residential area. I don't think it's fair to diminish someone 
else's quality of life for a cause." 
</P>
<P>
Leamon agreed that some centers helping the needy may outgrow their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"An organization that serves all comers is going to grow and will see a mix of 
the truly needy and some who are making the rounds," he said. "When a community 
begins to be overwhelmed . . it may be time for the group to take a look at 
being more selective, at managing its population." 
</P>
<P>
Still, many advocates argue that such a policy wrongly blames victims of 
homelessness for their problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You change the language -- call them vagrants, derelicts, bums. Making them 
less human makes it a lot easier to do things that are not so nice," Mather 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you start down that road, where is the line drawn?" said Vicki Walker, 
director of the Center for Creative Alternatives. "First, it's homeless, then 
people with emotional problems, then maybe it's people in wheelchairs or ethnic 
minorities." 
</P>
<P>
Whether neighborhoods succeed in keeping out welfare programs, the problems 
will remain, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution is not to run people out of one town to the next. There has to be 
communitywide involvement in trying to shelter these folks," Leamon said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the perceived aversion toward efforts to help the homeless, Mather said 
the task force has made progress in gaining community support. There have been 
some successes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Building Industry Assn. has begun a program to renovate existing homeless 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless issues task force is forming an interfaith shelter network, set to 
begin operation this fall, in which churches will house the homeless on a 
rotating basis during winter months. 
</P>
<P>
And Fullerton city officials recently approved the opening of a shelter for 
homeless mentally ill women. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a Pollyanna, but I'm hopeful," Mather said. "These problems will be 
with us for a long time, but we will eventually resolve them to everyone's 
benefit."

RESURRECTION OF GROWTH MEASURE SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lorraine Brouillette says she feels a sense of paradise lost when she looks at 
all the construction and traffic in her beloved San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"People came to this city because it was wonderful," Brouillette said. "People 
wanted to get away from smog, traffic and congestion, things they have in the 
north part of the county. But now, here in San Clemente, the environment also 
is getting spoiled." 
</P>
<P>
Brouillette and hundreds of others who share those sentiments have begun a 
legal crusade to resurrect Measure E, the slow-growth initiative passed in 
June, 1988 by a 63.5% vote. The measure would have required that service 
improvements such as more streets and parks accompany any new development. 
Orange County Superior Court Judge John C. Woolley ruled last fall that the 
measure was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"People in this community want the measure back because it set standards for 
growth, and now there are no standards," Brouillette said. "The elected 
officials (in San Clemente) do as they please." 
</P>
<P>
Brouillette is president of San Clementeans for Managed Growth, which is 
leading the battle to have Woolley's decision overturned. 
</P>
<P>
Legal briefs in the case are scheduled to be filed next month with the 4th 
District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana. A decision is not likely until next 
summer, however, because of the case backlog. 
</P>
<P>
The Lusk Co., the development company that successfully challenged Measure E in 
Superior Court last year, will continue its fight against the measure, said 
Donald D. Steffensen, Lusk executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll take this to the state Supreme Court -- to as far as it needs to be 
taken -- if necessary," he said. Company officials, he said, think Measure E 
"was a poorly written document that wouldn't really solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
In ruling against the measure, Woolley said it "requires property owners to 
mitigate conditions not only caused by their development -- a proper goal -- 
but also to cure the inadequacies of those who developed their property before 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Voters countywide turned down a similar slow-growth proposal, Measure A, for 
the county last year. Voters in San Juan Capistrano and Costa Mesa, however, 
approved city slow-growth measures modeled after San Clemente's, but those 
measures were likewise invalidated in Superior Court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
The rulings against the San Juan Capistrano and Costa Mesa measures are not 
being appealed, and should the appellate court rule in favor of the San 
Clemente measure, the ones for San Juan Capistrano and Costa Mesa would not be 
affected. Slow-growth advocates said nonetheless that a court victory for the 
San Clemente measure would still be a great boost. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a victory for the initiative approach" for slow growth, said Tom 
Rogers of San Juan Capistrano, who is president of Citizens for Sensible Growth 
and Traffic Control. His group led the countywide effort last year to pass 
Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
Mark I. Weinberger, a San Francisco lawyer whose firm is representing the 
slow-growth forces, said Measure E "does not excessively burden individual 
(development) projects." He said the initiative "is concerned about existing 
conditions, not what happened in the past." The thrust of Measure E, he said, 
is to make sure that a community "does not worsen" from a new development 
project. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Measure E supporters "believe the judge overreacted by 
throwing out the entire measure." The initiative contains a clause designed to 
preserve the rest of a law should a judge find part of it to be defective, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arguments Against Measure 
</P>
<P>
Measure E still has its detractors, to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
A number of business people and developers mounted a vociferous argument 
against it last fall just before Woolley made his ruling, saying that the 
initiative would be unworkable and would deter new business from the city. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a majority of the City Council last summer said that the 
initiative was so complex that there would need to be a six-month moratorium on 
major building projects in order to give the planning staff time to implement 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Brian J. Rice said in a recent interview that he supports "controlled 
growth" but that Measure E is flawed. He predicted that the city would face 
only endless litigation should it be revived. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council is doing their best to handle problems such as traffic," he 
said. He added that the council has appointed a growth-management committee and 
that many of its members "are people who supported Measure E." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Thomas Lorch strenuously objected last year when his colleagues 
voiced their criticisms of Measure E after voters approved it. Lorch said he 
still firmly believes that Measure E is workable and fair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sets Standards' 
</P>
<P>
"San Clemente is the fastest growing city in Orange County," he said. "Measure 
E gave us standards for growth, and now we have nothing in its place while we 
continue to process development." 
</P>
<P>
Brouillette charged that the city is sliding into chaotic development and that 
inadequate attention is being paid to water needs, flood control and other 
basic services.

"Measure E does not set limits; it simply sets standards," she said. "Most of 
the politicians don't want it, and the developers don't want it, but the people 
do want it. They voted overwhelmingly for it. Therefore we see the defense of 
Measure E to be a landmark case."

Museum Update -- A location near Pectin Reef, one of the county's richest 
paleontological sites, looks like a likely candidate to become the permanent 
home of the Museum of Natural History and Science, now housed in a former 
elementary school in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The marine fossil trove, off Moulton Parkway on Aliso Creek, is part of the 
county's proposed Aliso/Wood Canyons Regional Park. A general development plan 
for the 3,200-acre park includes a site for a museum building of 100,000 square 
feet, according to Eric Jessen, the county's chief planner. The plan is about 
90% complete and at least three months away from approval by the Board of 
Supervisors, Jessen said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly carefully studying the county's proposal," said Dudley Varner, 
the museum's executive director, who called the site "a highly desirable 
location." Pectin Reef is the source of many specimens in the museum's marine 
fossil collection, one of the biggest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
A building of 100,000 square feet would allow the consolidation of exhibit, 
storage and administrative space (a county warehouse is overflowing with 
fossils). Finding a permanent museum site has occupied Varner since he took his 
post in 1987. Dozens of sites have been considered, he said. The county's 
Pectin Reef proposal will be discussed at a museum board meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Varner and the board are also searching for an interim site to house the museum 
in the estimated five years it would take to build a permanent facility. They 
are seeking a building with high ceilings that has not been highly 
compartmentalized. Heading the list are several industrial buildings near John 
Wayne Airport. An interim site would probably incorporate large-scale animated 
dinosaurs and other creatures created by a local company called Dinamation. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, Varner had hoped to find a permanent site near Upper Newport Bay, 
but land prices and traffic considerations have apparently nixed that idea. 
Earlier last week, county supervisors accepted 114 acres bordering the bay from 
the Irvine Co. for a regional park. A $2.1-million interpretive center is 
planned for the site, to be operated jointly by the county and the state, but 
the donated property is too narrow to accommodate a large museum facility, 
Jessen said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Irvine Co. has ruled out construction on most of the land.

RETREAT TO TAHOE DIDN'T FILL THE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN B. LATHAM, Kathleen B. Latham of Lake Tahoe is a management 
consultant who is planning to return to Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She looked at me with flaring eyes, and in that instant I knew it was 
inevitable. For six months I had been seriously considering leaving the Los 
Angeles/Orange County area. I debated the pros and cons. I talked to a Realtor. 
I did calculations and recalculations, and I even developed a strategy. 
Somehow, though, I couldn't cross the line between consideration and action. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, I was in Westwood. Traffic was heavy. I had been trying to make a 
left turn when a window of opportunity presented itself, and I cut in front of 
another car. As I began to execute the turn, I locked eyes with the other 
driver. Her eyes were as cold as steel and they cut through me like a knife. I 
knew if she could have she would have killed me on the spot. In her eyes I 
could see all the frustrations associated with living in L.A. They told me what 
I had been feeling about living here. I made the decision. Snap! I would call 
the Realtor tonight. 
</P>
<P>
What was it I saw in that chance moment? I had been feeling for a long time 
that connecting, I mean really connecting, with people on a day-to-day, 
normal-activity basis was nearly impossible. The stress and strains of a 
hectic, overcrowded environment seemed to make us all retreat into our own 
world of frustration. We have our friends and sometimes we permit ourselves to 
connect, to open up just a little. Typically, however, we seem to focus on our 
own world, staying in our own microcosm, not looking to the right, not looking 
to the left, nor behind, only straight ahead to where we are headed. A shopping 
experience meets with cold stares, efforts to beat each other in line, or other 
behavior which clearly echoes the cry, "I don't care about you." 
</P>
<P>
I moved to Irvine 13 years ago when it was one of the most wonderful places to 
live. Gradually, without my knowing it, it had changed. It wasn't the same. 
Only in the previous six months did I begin to sense this. Then there was also 
the problem of people constantly flowing into Orange County and the impossible, 
untenable highway overcrowding. Going to the post office, once a 15-minute 
project, was now an hour's ordeal. Freeway trips to see clients in Los Angeles 
became a full-scale travel experience: Commute five hours and work for seven 
hours. Every four years I gave up one person-year to the freeways. Was this the 
way I wanted to live, turning gray in my car, fighting exhaustion and listening 
to radio talk shows I had no interest in? Even a car phone didn't help the 
feeling of sheer waste -- waste of my precious time, my life. 
</P>
<P>
Several times in the past I had vacationed on the North Shore of Lake Tahoe. I 
had felt the peace and sensed the congeniality. As I thought about moving, 
Tahoe came to mind. There I felt I could find all that I was longing for, all 
that I thought I needed. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty that is Lake Tahoe brought serenity and peace just to look at it. 
People in the grocery store actually smiled and exchanged pleasantries. 
Traffic, even during what they called rush hour, didn't seem to be a problem. 
Occasionally tourist traffic slowed things down, but not very often and 
generally not in Incline Village where I thought I might settle. 
</P>
<P>
Then, of course, there was a difference in the house I could buy. A lovely 
property with a lake view could be bought for $300,000. Could I ever hope for 
that in Orange County? Life in Tahoe seemed real: real people, doing real 
things, working together to create a wonderful place to live. Ask anyone in 
Lake Tahoe where they had come from and if they like it and typically you 
heard, "The Los Angeles area. I love it and I'd never move back." 
</P>
<P>
It's now three months after my move. Did I find what I was seeking? No, I think 
not. What I was looking for was not outside. It had to come from inside. I had 
gotten so sucked into the stresses and frustrations, I lost sight of the 
positives of living in Orange County. The ever-unfolding business and personal 
opportunities. The chance to live on the leading edge, to be constantly moving 
forward and experiencing new things, new people. To be accepted as a dynamic, 
business-oriented, tough-minded woman and to fit in without having to temper 
who I was for a slow-moving community. 
</P>
<P>
I had lost sight of the real issue, the issue that was my own attitude toward 
-- and about -- where I lived. I got so caught up in the small percentage of 
negatives, I didn't see the positives. Perhaps that happens to all of us, those 
of us who forget to smile at each other in the grocery store, or who fail to 
stop so the other guy can cross the parking lot. The negatives loom large and 
we focus on them, overlooking the good and withholding good from each other. 
Get caught up in the frustrations that are L.A. and you behave in ways you 
didn't think possible for yourself. Then one day you find yourself living in a 
town of 7,000 people wondering what on earth a cosmopolitan gal like you is 
doing there. 
</P>
<P>
Will I sell my gorgeous house, overlooking one of the most beautiful lakes in 
the world? Will I trade the quiet for the city life? Make me a reasonable offer 
and you can have my house. Orange County, here I come! If you see a lady 
smiling in the check-out line, it's probably me.

COSTA MESA COUNCIL'S DECISION TO EVICT SOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shame on the Costa Mesa City Council (except Vice Mayor Mary Hornbuckle) for 
voting to evict Share Our Selves (SOS) in six months (July 19). For 19 years 
this all-volunteer, private, nonprofit agency has been a shining example of 
what President Bush calls "a thousand points of light." 
</P>
<P>
SOS provides food, clothes, free medical and dental care and emergency 
financial aid to 6,000 poor families a month. And SOS spends less than 3% of 
its funds on administrative overhead. Not many groups, public or private, can 
claim such success. 
</P>
<P>
Now a small vocal band of neighbors has pressured the city into canceling SOS's 
lease at the Rea Community Center -- its home since 1981. The tenor of the 
neighbors' comments at Monday's hearing was telling: "I don't want to see poor 
people lining up for food. It's depressing." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Peter F. Buffa's explanation for allowing the SOS medical and dental 
clinic an extra year before eviction was equally offensive. He said the people 
who come for medical care are of a different (presumably better) "set" than 
those who come for food. Apparently, for those of discriminating tastes (like 
the good mayor), a poor person who is ill is less objectionable than one who is 
hungry. 
</P>
<P>
We are now seeing the true trickle-down effect of Reaganomics: selfishness and 
loss of compassion in our neighborhoods.

ANGELS TIED WITH TIGERS IN 15TH INNING; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE PLAYS KEY ROLE FOR STARTERS GIBSON, ABBOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes, a little defense can go a long way. And sometimes a few little 
defensive lapses can make everything go the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Detroit starter Paul Gibson. Or Angel starter Jim Abbott, for that 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson benefited from a spectacular, home run-robbing catch by center fielder 
Gary Pettis Saturday night. And Abbott was once again victimized by some sloppy 
defense as the Angels and Tigers battled into the 15th inning tied, 4-4, in 
front of 48,766 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Pettis' reactions in the fourth inning saved the Tigers at least one run, and 
Tony Armas' reactions in the ninth cost the Angels a chance to win the game in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Wally Joyner led off the ninth with a single to right. When Downing tried to 
sacrifice, Gibson grabbed the ball and fired to second. His throw beat Joyner, 
but it was high and Joyner slid in safely. Devon White did sacrifice, and 
Gibson walked Lance Parrish to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson had two strikes on Armas when he unleashed a pitch that was 
shoulder-high and inside. Armas intuitively spun out of harm's way, but 
probably wishes he could go back and take a game-winning shot on the arm for 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
Armas ended up forcing Joyner, and Glenn Hoffman popped up to end the inning 
and give Gibson, who has never had a complete game in the majors, a chance to 
pitch the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott was long gone by then -- he went just five innings -- and he must have 
been thinking about his last start. The Angels made four errors and Toronto 
scored four unearned runs last Monday. This time, the struggling Tigers got the 
gift package, turning four Angel errors into three unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who have made the third-fewest errors in league (60), seem to have 
collective breakdowns these days. Manager Doug Rader said the miscues in 
Toronto were "forgivable" because the Angels were playing in a new facility -- 
the Blue Jays' SkyDome -- and weren't familiar with the playing surface. 
</P>
<P>
But they didn't have any excuses Saturday night on their home turf as they 
bobbled and fumbled threw the early innings. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott got a bad omen in the first inning Saturday night. Pettis led off with a 
single to center and, one out later, stole second. Then Tracy Jones hit a 
very-routine bouncer at shortstop Dick Schofield, who let the ball go between 
his legs as Pettis jogged home. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers earned run No. 2, though. With two out in the second, Rick Schu 
crushed a 1-1 delivery from Abbott and deposited it 415 feet from home plate 
beyond the fence in dead center. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, who is less-than-proficient at holding runners on, gave the Tigers 
plenty of opportunity to run in the early going. He yielded a single to the 
leadoff batter in each of the first three innings and all three runners 
attempted to steal second. Pettis succeeded in the first; Chet Lemon got caught 
in the second and Mike Brumley was safe in the third. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels took a 3-2 lead in the fourth, but it would have been a bigger 
inning if not for a spectacular catch by Pettis. Johnny Ray singled to right 
and, after Joyner struck out, Downing slammed a drive to left-center. Pettis 
raced back and timed his jump. With his armpit on the top of the wall, he 
reached back and caught the ball -- about a yard beyond the fence. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson didn't exactly make the most of this good fortune, however. He walked 
White and then gave up a towering three-run homer to Parrish. It was Parrish's 
13th homer, already a single-season record for an Angel catcher. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers regained the lead in the fifth, however, thanks to some more shoddy 
defensive play by the Angels. Abbott, whose ability to smoothly transfer his 
glove and remove the ball has amazed on-lookers since his college days, snagged 
a comebacker from Brumley but couldn't get the ball out and make a throw to 
first in time. 
</P>
<P>
Pettis followed with a single and Keith Moreland walked to load the bases. 
Brumley scored on Jones' sacrifice fly to right and Pettis scored when Glenn 
Hoffman couldn't handle Alan Trammell's chopper to put Detroit ahead, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield atoned for his first-inning error in the bottom of the fifth, 
slugging a line-drive homer to left-center. It was his third home run of the 
year and first at home since Aug. 26 of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader moved Wally Joyner into the clean-up spot June 24, and 
the first baseman finally has started to respond with a surge worthy of the No. 
4 spot. Joyner had four home runs in 419 at-bats before hitting three in the 
last seven games. "It could be a self-fulfilling prophecy," Rader said. 
"Sometimes, you put a player in a position perceived to be more glamorous and 
he responds." Rader thinks there are also a couple of other factors playing an 
important role in Joyner's streak. "First, you've got to admire Wally for his 
tenacity," he said. "He's worked hard, he's persevered nicely and now he's 
swinging the bat really well. And others around him are hitting, so (opposing 
pitchers) don't have the luxury of feeding him anything but an assortment of 
garbage. He's been getting better pitches to hit lately." Whatever the reasons, 
Joyner is on a tear. He extended his hitting streak to eight games with a 
ninth-inning single Saturday, giving him 15 hits in 35 at-bats, a .429 average. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Manager Tony La Russa decided to unshuffle his starting pitching 
Saturday after announcing Friday that he would start right-hander Bob Welch in 
the three-game series against the Angels, which begins Monday. A rainout 
Wednesday in Detroit provided La Russa with the option of skipping Curt Young, 
but La Russa changed his mind and the Athletics will stay in their normal 
order. Young will pitch Monday night; Dave Stewart will start Tuesday night, 
and Mike Moore will pitch Wednesday. . . . Left fielder Chili Davis, mired in a 
six-for-53 slump, and third baseman Jack Howell, who has just one hit in his 
last 19 at-bats, had the night off Saturday. "Chili did a lot of extra work 
before the game, and when you do as much extra work as he did, a rest is 
appropriate," Rader said. Asked what kind of work he had done, Davis smiled and 
said: "Nothing much, just hitting, lots of hitting. You know, the hard part of 
this game."

GOFORTH WITHSTANDS TRAVEL, TRAGEDY TO CONTINUE CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Toni Goforth, 16, has had to do a lot of traveling to play the caliber of fast 
pitch softball she and her parents believe will get her a college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a week in the summer, Mary Jo Goforth, Toni's mother, drives Toni seven 
hours round-trip from the family's home in Santa Maria to Westminster. There, 
Goforth practices as a pitcher with the Batbusters -- the defending national 
champions in the 16-and-under division of the American Softball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The mileage builds even more when her dad, Paul, drives her to weekend games. 
</P>
<P>
But Toni has had to make a journey that can't be measured in miles to even play 
softball this season. 
</P>
<P>
Goforth is recovering from third-degree burns over both legs suffered Jan. 27, 
1988, in a propane gas explosion in the family's motor home. 
</P>
<P>
Goforth and her mother had moved into the motor home in Santa Ynez, 30 miles 
south of Santa Maria, so Toni could qualify to play travel ball in the Southern 
Division and increase her chances of being seen by the top college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better competition and better coaching (in the Southern Division)," said 
Goforth, who already has been contacted by Georgia State and Florida State 
although she will be only a junior at Righetti High School this fall. "I have a 
better chance of getting a college scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Maria is in the Central Division and Goforth could not get a release from 
ASA's Central California commissioner, Dick Grove, who wanted talented players 
to help strengthen the division. So Goforth had to move within Southern 
District boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Three days after the move, during the second semester of her freshman year "a 
(piece) on the motor home's propane stove came loose and blew up in my mom's 
face," Goforth said. 
</P>
<P>
"I pulled my mom out and got myself out. I didn't really know I was burned at 
first. I looked down and I saw flames coming off my legs." 
</P>
<P>
Toni did what she had been taught in school. She stopped, dropped and rolled on 
the ground to put out the flames instead of trying to put them out with her 
hands, her mother said. "The doctor said had she not done that, if she tried to 
put them out with her hands, she would have burned her palms and would not have 
pitched this year," her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the burns covered such a large area and were so deep that Dr. Richard 
Grossman of the Sherman Oaks Burn Center warned Toni she probably would not 
play softball for at least six months and probably a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing (Toni) asked the doctor when she was in the hospital was if she 
could play softball," Mary Jo said. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman performed five surgeries. Toni wears special stockings and shin guards 
to protect her legs, but otherwise is fine. 
</P>
<P>
Toni and her mother were in the hospital 17 days. A month and a half later, 
Goforth played in her first high school tournament for Santa Ynez High School. 
</P>
<P>
"This girl was determined to play softball and she just pushed herself and 
pushed herself and by her own force of will was able to do it," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Toni: "All my friends think I'm crazy to come down here (but) I care about 
softball more than my school work, and I care about softball more than my 
boyfriend." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Jo Goforth also has recovered from the accident. She acknowledges that not 
many parents would do what she and her husband are doing for Toni. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she knows softball is her daughter's first love and she hopes it 
will get her to college and perhaps the Olympics if softball becomes an 
exhibition sport in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
After Toni's father sent a letter of protest to the ASA's national office this 
spring, Toni got a release to play in the Southern Division this season. But 
next year it might be even harder because the ASA is considering doing away 
with releases, said Bobbi Jordan, ASA's Southern California commissioner.

SOVIET VENTURES; 
</P>
<P>
O.C. EXECUTIVES DECIDE TO GO FOR THE RUBLES 
</P>

<P>
At a gift shop in the Ukraine Hotel in Moscow, foreign guests browsing for 
goodies to take home can choose from paperback book best-sellers from the 
United States, perfumes from France and official icons from the Russian 
Orthodox Church. 
</P>
<P>
They can also find bumper stickers that say "Don't Worry!" in Russian and 
silkscreened "Gorby" T-shirts. The T-shirts, of course, pay tribute to Soviet 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose sweeping program of social and economic 
reforms have made all this possible. 
</P>
<P>
Let it be said, however, that it took a fourth-generation Russian-American 
named Martin Lopata, a Huntington Beach businessman, to bring "Bonfire of the 
Vanities," $20 T-shirts and $1,000 religious icons together in one place. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint venture with several Soviet government and private organizations, 
Lopata recently opened several hotel gift shops in Moscow and Leningrad 
designed specifically for Western visitors. He is among a growing number of 
Orange County companies and private business people who are pioneers of sorts 
in the new Soviet economy. They are coming with ambitious, sometimes 
unrealistic, dreams of cashing in on improved trade relations between the 
United States and the Soviet Union in the age of glasnost and perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
* Injet Medical Devices of Irvine is trying to sell the Soviets a unique, 
needle-less hypodermic syringe for use in hospitals and medical clinics. The 
Soviets contacted Injet after AIDS outbreaks in Elista and Volgograd in 
southern Russia were traced earlier this year to contaminated needles used 
during hospital treatment. At least 81 children in the cities have been 
infected with the virus, and some have passed it on to their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
* A group of Newport Beach investors has hired former Watergate figure H.R. 
(Bob) Haldeman to help sell the Soviets on the idea of putting up high-tech 
executive office complexes for foreign companies. 
</P>
<P>
* Besides the hotel gift shops, Lopata's joint venture has also opened one of 
the first photocopying and printing shops in Moscow. The venture, called 
Sovaminco, aims at opening additional shops, which will cater to Western 
businesses rather than Soviet citizens, in Leningrad and several other Soviet 
cities. The company also reached a deal with USA Today to distribute the 
newspaper in Moscow and Leningrad on the same day of publication -- the first 
time the paper has been available in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
These and other Orange County companies have joined in a surge of U.S.-Soviet 
business partnerships made possible by Gorbachev's reforms, intended to 
modernize the Soviet economy and bring new openness to the nation's political 
system. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1987, Gorbachev changed the law to allow Soviet enterprises to form 
joint ventures with foreign companies. Since the law was enacted, more than 500 
U.S. joint ventures have been registered, only a handful have actually been 
licensed. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for all the interest among American business is simple: The Soviet 
Union is the world's second-largest economy after the United States, with a 
population of more than 280 million people who have hoarded a vast supply of 
rubles but have had little to spend them on. Because so many consumer goods are 
scarce or unavailable, Soviet citizens have just been waiting for something to 
buy with all those rubles. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time since the Russian Revolution, you have private enterprises 
being allowed in the Soviet Union," said Michael J. Bayzler, a Russian-born 
Whittier College law professor and specialist in East-West trade. 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the local companies' projects involve products or services 
intended to tap the Soviet Union's huge consumer market, other U.S. firms are 
getting ready to do so. For example, McDonald's Corp. plans to open two 
restaurants in 1989 and more than a dozen later on. 
</P>
<P>
So far, profits have been elusive for the companies doing business in the 
Soviet Union. Of the 60 or so U.S.-Soviet joint ventures now up and running, 
few, if any, are making money, trade experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Still, companies in Orange County and elsewhere tend to stress the long view. 
They say investments made now will reap future rewards. 
</P>
<P>
"The companies that are going to share in the Soviet market are the ones that 
go through the proper steps now," said Wesley F. Nelson, vice president of 
international sales for AST Research Inc., an Irvine computer company. 
</P>
<P>
"In 10 years, we think there has to be quite a market for desktop computers" in 
the Soviet Union, said Nelson, who visited Moscow earlier this year to begin 
establishing some ties between AST and Soviet organizations. "The potential 
there is large enough for a company like AST to spend time and resources 
cultivating the market." 
</P>
<P>
But doing business in the Soviet Union is easier said then done. 
</P>
<P>
Everyday tasks -- making a telephone call, having a business letter typed or 
translated, or sending a fax back to the home office -- can be a headache. 
</P>
<P>
"If your business plan says something will take six months, then figure on 
doubling it," Lopata advised. 
</P>
<P>
Lopata, whose great-grandfather ran a bakery near Kiev before immigrating to 
New York, was attending a joint U.S.-Soviet citizens' summit in Alexandria, 
Va., last year when an official of the Soviet State Committee for Publishing, 
Printing and Book Trade (Goskomizdat) contacted him about setting up an 
offset-printing business in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets proposed a joint venture, and last September Lopata's printing and 
copying venture, called Soviet American International Co., or Sovaminco, was 
announced with some fanfare at a press conference at the Soviet Consulate in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Sovaminco's first printing shop opened last month in Moscow and is now churning 
out T-shirts, business cards and bumper stickers. The shop has an offset press, 
a silk-screen printing press, high-speed copiers and other publishing 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Setting up shop in the Soviet Union is no breeze, as Lopata found out. His 
original Soviet partners told him that they had found a site for the printing 
plant in a Moscow office building, but they really hadn't. Lopata, who speaks 
only a few Russian phrases, was forced to look for a new partner and a new 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Sovaminco's project faced further delays when $1 million worth of office 
equipment shipped from the United States was left sitting in a Leningrad 
railyard for two months before being forwarded to Moscow. Once the equipment 
was in place, it took another two months to get the building wired for 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
The print shop finally opened in early July -- seven months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been way beyond anything I ever imagined in terms of how long it has 
taken to get started," Lopata said. "The (Soviet) system is that slow." 
</P>
<P>
Undeterred, Lopata, 50, is rushing ahead with all kinds of other plans for 
businesses and services designed primarily for the Western business person or 
tourist. 
</P>
<P>
He talks excitedly about opening Western-style restaurants and bars, movie 
theaters, a sightseeing tour bus service, a hotel video movie rental business 
-- the list goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
Where does he get all his ideas? "We just look around and ask ourselves, 'What 
would a tourist want?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Danson has never traveled to the Soviet Union and, until recently, had 
never given much thought to doing business there. Today, he is preparing for 
his first trip to Moscow and spending much of his time figuring how to break 
into the Soviet market. 
</P>
<P>
Danson is president of Injet Medical Devices Inc., which developed a patented 
needle-less hypodermic injection device that the company has been trying to 
sell to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. 
</P>
<P>
Among its potential medical uses, the device can help solve a prickly medical 
problem: health-care workers who become infected with diseases or viruses 
because of accidental sticks with contaminated hypodermic needles. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets contacted Injet after the company's investment banker, who ran a 
small U.S.-Soviet export business, told a Russian banker friend of his about 
the product. Last March, officials with the Soviet's Ministry of Health and 
Ministry of Instrumentation traveled to Southern California to take a 
first-hand look at Injet's product. 
</P>
<P>
Injet executives arranged a meeting in a Hollywood film studio where they 
demonstrated the injector by shooting green dye into a turkey breast. 
Apparently, the Soviets liked what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem extraordinarily interested," Danson said. "They have a significant 
problem over there with contaminated needles. That problem won't go away with 
conventional, disposable needles. 
</P>
<P>
"We had really been looking at the U.S. market. Then this Soviet thing just 
came out of the blue." 
</P>
<P>
But Injet faces some hurdles before it can take advantage of the Soviet 
opportunity. The company has no manufacturing plant to produce the injectors 
and no money to build one. Even if the Soviets placed a big order for the 
injectors immediately, Injet couldn't fill it. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a small company, and this is an enormous project," Danson said, adding 
that Injet is seeking private investment to start production of the injectors. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets want Injet to show them how to manufacture the needle-less 
injectors so they can set up their own manufacturing plant. They also want the 
rights to market the product in the Soviet Union and the East Bloc. In return, 
Injet would receive royalties of 5% for each injector sold. 
</P>
<P>
When a Newport Beach investment group was trying to sell the Soviets on the 
idea of building plush, high-tech office buildings for foreign companies, it 
turned to a familiar face from the past: Bob Haldeman, the former top-level 
Nixon Administration aide. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Haldeman) has a certain amount of expertise in the hotel business," 
Newport Beach investor Bernard Rome said. "He had a lot of varied experience 
that can be drawn upon." 
</P>
<P>
Haldeman heads Americom International Corp.'s advisory committee. Rome is 
Americom's founder and chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine firm was formed to bring the idea of "intelligent" office buildings 
to the Soviet Union. The buildings would be outfitted with advanced 
technologies such as video teleconferencing and satellite hookups with the 
West. All this in a country where fax machines and push-button phones are still 
viewed with awe. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing business in the Soviet Union for 15 years," Rome said. "One of 
the major things that has always been lacking are support services." 
</P>
<P>
Rome said it is difficult for American business people to find office space to 
lease in the Soviet Union, so they often must work out of hotel rooms. But 
hotels lack ordinary business services, such as copying or fax machines, that 
Western business travelers take for granted. 
</P>
<P>
Most Soviet hotels also lack direct-dial, long-distance phone service. Overseas 
phone calls have to be placed through an operator, a process that can take 
hours at peak calling periods. 
</P>
<P>
Americom's complexes would also have pooled services -- receptionists, copying 
machines and word processors -- that would be shared by the tenants, who would 
lease space for periods ranging from one day to several years. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have access to an English-speaking secretary and could get your phones 
answered and messages forwarded," Rome said. "You wouldn't have to spend 75% of 
your time worrying about how to get things done." 
</P>
<P>
Rome said Soviet officials seem quite interested in the project, but he admits 
to growing impatient with the lengthy process. He will head for Moscow later 
this month to try to speed things up and still hopes to have the first office 
opened by early 1990.

FUTURISTS SEE BURST OF NEW USES FOR COMPUTERS AT DAWN OF NEXT CENTURY

<P>
The dawn of the 21st Century will find personal computers put to a wide array 
of new uses, such as voting, filing income tax returns and taking college 
entrance exams. 
</P>
<P>
Magazines will be available on floppy disks, and racing fans will watch 
contests on cable TV and place their bets from their couches, automatically 
debiting or crediting their bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Automation, robotics and computer applications in manufacturing will result in 
a shorter average workweek of 32 hours, meaning more leisure time, while the 
divorce rate will drop and the marriage rate will increase. 
</P>
<P>
These predictions were among many circulated at the World Future Society's 
sixth general assembly, a five-day conference and exposition held last week at 
the Sheraton Washington Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Series of Lectures 
</P>
<P>
The conference, titled "Future View, the 1990s &amp; Beyond," offered a series 
of lectures, seminars and exhibits geared to research and predictions divided 
under the headings of biosphere, sociosphere, technosphere, econosphere, 
politisphere, futuresphere and 21st-Century studies. 
</P>
<P>
The World Future Society, which has 32,000 members including academics, 
professionals and government employees, has been around for almost a quarter of 
a century, but it has only recently gained credibility, said Edward Cornish, 
president of the Bethesda, Md.-based society. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1960s, people regarded futurists as science fiction fans who took their 
science fiction books too seriously. But the pace of change in society has been 
so fast, people need futurists to keep them abreast of what's happening and 
help them to identify the range of possibilities for the future," Cornish said. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in the study of the future also is increasing as the 21st Century 
nears. "It's millennial fever," said Jennifer Jarratt, vice president of J.F. 
Coates Inc., a Washington-based future analysis firm, and co-author of "What 
Futurists Believe." 
</P>
<P>
Jarratt said her firm's future assessments are based on a comprehensive study 
of newspapers, journals, databases and other sources of information, as well as 
an analysis of the past and present. 
</P>
<P>
"Businesses need this as a way to organize their lives and prepare for what 
lies ahead," said Jarratt, who added that IBM Corp., AT&amp;T and numerous 
government agencies are among her firm's clients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flaws in Education 
</P>
<P>
Joseph F. Coates, president of the firm, said some of the major concerns for 
business in the future must be addressed today. He cited increasing national 
illiteracy figures and called for improved classroom education and business 
training programs. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Northrop &amp; Associates Inc., a Louisiana business consulting firm, 
said many people are frightened of the future, but businesses must overcome 
those fears. She predicted that corporate managers in the year 2000 will have 
to be great integrators who can combine the old notion of power with new ideas 
about individual creativity. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still in the evolutionary process, but we are leading to a more healthy 
system where employees have more self-respect and fulfillment from their work," 
Northrop said. According to a report by the society, some other business trends 
expected for the 21st Century include shifts in the labor force and management. 
</P>
<P>
The number of entrepreneurs will increase as more mid-career professionals get 
squeezed out of the flattening management pyramid in large companies. In 2001, 
only one person in 50 will be promoted to top management, compared with one 
person in 20 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, 85% of the labor force will be working for firms that employ 
fewer than 200 people each. 
</P>
<P>
The service economy is expected to account for as much as 88% of the work force 
by the year 2000 as low-paying service jobs continue to replace many 
well-paying jobs lost in manufacturing, transportation and agriculture, the 
report said.
