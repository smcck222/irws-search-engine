BUSH EXPRESSES HIS VIEWS ON LATINO ISSUES 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In wide-ranging comments to Latino reporters, President Bush voiced support for 
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, chided Fidel Castro as being "out of step" 
and called on Congress to decide whether the employer sanction provision of the 
1986 immigration law is causing widespread discrimination against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen journalists were invited by the White House for the question-and-answer 
session, one of a series of briefings with various groups of reporters. 
Although Bush did not set forth substantially new policy positions, the session 
provided a forum for the President to express his views on a variety of Latino 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
In an opening statement, Bush called education the foremost issue of "concern 
to the Hispanic community" and referred to Cavazos' work in directing a 
"massive study" on Latino educational issues. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos angered many Latinos earlier this year by putting the blame on parents 
for many of the achievement problems of Latino students, including a 
high-school dropout rate nearing 40%. In Los Angeles last month, where Cavazos 
held the last in a series of hearings on Latino education, he was assailed by a 
number of parents and educators. 
</P>
<P>
Coming to Cavazos' defense, Bush said, "I've got great confidence in him. It 
burns me up when I see shots fired at him." The President said the Cavazos 
study will result in "key suggestions . . . that I'm sure will be turned around 
into action." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding Castro, Bush said the Cuban leader "should be celebrating, along with 
other countries, the demise of the Berlin Wall." Instead, the President 
continued: "Castro is criticizing Gorbachev for being not true to a Communist 
revolution. He's out of step. He's swimming against the tide. He is a symbol, 
the lone holdout of a Marxist totalitarianism that has failed all around the 
world. And he ought to be better to his people than that." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that, if "Castro wants to say something constructive -- more 
democracy, more freedom, more openness, more free press, more acceptance of a 
change that is worldwide, fine, I'm listening. . . . But to say that, as some 
have suggested, you ought to go down -- sit down and talk to Castro right now 
and that will solve any problems, I don't see that at all." 
</P>
<P>
Bush asserted that as long as the Soviet Union continues to provide a subsidy 
to Cuba, "it will be very, very difficult for the United States to help the 
Soviet Union with their enormous financial problems." 
</P>
<P>
On immigration, Bush said he could not condone discriminatory employment 
practices, but he declined to acknowledge that the employer sanctions in the 
1986 immigration law are causing job problems for Latinos who are legally 
entitled to work in the United States. And, he said, "I don't know about 
repealing it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he urged Congress to investigate and determine whether discrimination 
practices are occurring. When a reporter pointed out that the General 
Accounting Office, the investigatory arm of Congress, already had issued a 
report citing prejudice against Latinos in employment, Bush said: "I haven't 
read the GAO report and so I don't comment on things I haven't read." 
</P>
<P>
Latino national organizations have lobbied strongly for repeal of employer 
sanctions since the GAO issued its report last March 29. The GAO study found 
that "widespread discrimination is practiced by an estimated 19% of employers 
nationally and 29% of employers in the Los Angeles area." 
</P>
<P>
The Latino groups argue that employers, rather than risk violating the law's 
sanctions, sometimes avoid hiring anyone who looks or sounds foreign. 
</P>
<P>
There has been little support, however, for repeal of the sanctions by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
During the 45-minute session, held in the Roosevelt Room, the President also 
touched on other subjects. Here are excerpts of Bush's comments: 
</P>
<P>
On the proposed referendum in Puerto Rico on the island's future status: 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly support such a referendum. . . . I'm for statehood and I've said 
so. I want to see a fair referendum to give the people their say. So I use this 
statement right now as a strong assertion that I support Congressman (Robert 
J.) Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) and others who are pushing for the kind of referendum 
that you asked me about." 
</P>
<P>
On a pending civil rights bill: 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we're going to get a civil rights bill I can sign. I've tried to be out 
front with some of the groups that have been lobbying, making clear to them 
that I'm not going to sign a quota bill. Everyone says there's no quotas in 
this bill, and then I say, well fine, let's state it; let's find ways to make 
it clear. Quotas work, in my view, against all groups . . . 
</P>
<P>
"As you know, I've made a commitment to use the bully pulpit, which is the 
White House and the President's office, to speak out against racism and bigotry 
and hate. . . . Of course, we've passed this Hate Crimes Bill that I hope is 
going to be helpful." 
</P>
<P>
On a proposed free-trade agreement with Mexico: 
</P>
<P>
"We support the FTA with Mexico. There are some problems out there. . . . I 
think they can be overcome, and I think . . . a deal can be worked out that is 
in the benefit of both our countries. Let me say that I'm impressed with 
President (Carlos Salinas de Gortari's) approach to these problems." 
</P>
<P>
On whether immigration would be affected by a free-trade agreement: 
</P>
<P>
"Could be. Could be. But I don't know yet how that will link in. Labor is the 
big question, you know . . . our labor unions have some strong concerns. But 
the process is pretty arduous and we'll give every group a chance to be heard. 
But we've got to look at the broad canvas . . . ameliorating the economy of 
Mexico and not diminishing our economic interests." 
</P>
<P>
On allegations that economic aid to help Andean countries fight drugs is being 
tied to military action: 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly have been trying to be helpful on the economic side, and I think 
they've welcomed the economic support, and we've tried to be helpful on the 
interdiction side. But nobody is trying to dictate to any sovereign country 
what must be done in a military sense." 
</P>
<P>
On making adjustments to the U.S. Census to make up for an expected undercount 
of minorities: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know enough about that to have an opinion. I do know that every time 
there's a census, some people allege that it's an unfair count. . . . I can't 
say that the census is unfair because I don't think that -- I think the jury is 
still out." 
</P>
<P>
On the feeling by some Latinos in the Southwest that they are being neglected: 
</P>
<P>
"Well, there are people that live in Washington, D.C., that think they're being 
neglected, and (on) the West Coast that think they are. So what we've got to do 
is have sensitive programs that benefit people and keep the unemployment 
statistics going down so people have jobs. But I think you're absolutely right. 
. . . But I don't know how you make it totally inclusive. We have 254 million 
people here. I try my best. . . ."

* Daniel Lozano could hear the pedestrians say, "Construction is all a Mexican 
can do," as they walked by the building project where he worked. The remarks 
made him angry -- and more determined. 
</P>
<P>
In a chilling glimpse of what could have been his future, he had heard older 
construction workers complain about what they might have done with their lives. 
At 24, he returned to school and wound up graduating first in his Whittier 
College class. Now 29, Lozano will enter UC San Francisco medical school on 
full scholarship this fall. "When I told my friends in construction what I 
planned to do, they were all behind me," he said. "One of them bought books for 
my first semester as a way of saying, 'Go get 'em.' " 
</P>
<P>
* 'More and more Latinas are now lawyers who have been prosecutors and are very 
competent to assume positions of great responsibility," said former Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Lourdes G. Baird, the new U.S. Attorney for the Central 
District of California. Based in Los Angeles, the district is the largest in 
the country, spanning seven counties from San Luis Obispo to Riverside. With 
138 lawyers, the office handles many highly publicized drug and defense fraud 
cases. A bilingual native of Ecuador, Baird, 55, said she thinks her selection 
may be a first for a Latina, "but I hope it's part of a changing scene." EDWARD

PARADE, PROTEST TO RETRACE ROUTE OF HISTORIC RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYDIA RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years after a historic march, rally and riot involving 20,000 Los 
Angeles area Mexican-Americans, the 1990 National Chicano Moratorium Committee 
will hold a commemorative parade and protest down the same East Los Angeles 
route. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers believe that about 10,000 people will participate Aug. 25 in the 
three-mile parade and a rally featuring longtime Chicano activists, politicians 
and student leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a protest," but also a Chicano cultural parade, said Sandra Vargas, Los 
Angeles regional co-chair of the 1990 National Chicano Moratorium Committee. 
Latino community leaders, politicians and celebrities will ride aboard caravans 
draped with banners, Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the catalyst for the event was the Vietnam War, but it addressed other 
Chicano grievances. "The moratorium was generated because of a protest not only 
against the war in Vietnam but a protest of the way . . . Mexicanos were being 
treated in society and how the Mexicanos were giving their lives 
disproportionately in a war that nobody wanted," said Richard Martinez, a 1970s 
activist who is executive director of the Southwest Voter Registration 
Education Project. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say they will be demonstrating for decent jobs and salaries for all, 
quality education and the end of barrio violence and drug trafficking. "It's 
not just a one-day thing, we're talking about the resurrection of the Chicano 
movement, " said Jorge Castro, a Chicano Moratorium Committee official. "It 
will be a vehicle to address the needs of the community." 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 committee also is critical of the planned celebration in 1992 of 500 
years of Christopher Columbus' "discovery of America." "The Europeans imposed 
another culture and annihilated the indigenous people," said Carlos Montes, the 
committee's Los Angeles regional co-chair. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 25, marchers will gather at 10 a.m. at Alberto Diaz Plaza in Belvedere 
Park. Starting at 11 a.m., following the march route of Aug. 29, 1970, they 
will walk up 3rd Street, down Atlantic Boulevard and west on Whittier Boulevard 
to the old Laguna Park, now named Ruben Salazar County Park. Salazar, a Los 
Angeles Times columnist, was one of three people killed in violence after the 
1970 march. 
</P>
<P>
Dolores Huerta of the United Farm Workers Union, historian Rudy Acuna and David 
Sanchez, founder of the 1970s Chicano unit known as the Brown Berets, will be 
among speakers at the Salazar Park rally. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers also have asked local politicians to address the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-area high school and college students have joined longtime Chicano 
activists in organizing the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty percent, if they were not involved in the (1970) moratorium committee, 
they were very active," Castro said. "The other half was too young." 
</P>
<P>
Castro stressed that the current organizers are politically "more center" than 
their counterparts of 1970, who were seen by many as radicals. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers were granted their parade permit last April when the Board of 
Supervisors overruled the Sheriff's Department, which was opposed to the use of 
the 1970 route because of the possibility of rioting and the estimated $37,000 
it would cost in overtime pay for officers. 
</P>
<P>
Some Whittier Boulevard business owners also have criticized the location of 
the protest route. Howard Barsky, whose family owns La Popular furniture store 
on Whittier Boulevard, helped organize water stations for marchers in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the boulevard has been used enough for this particular march," Barsky 
said. "But now that they're going to have it, we'll watch the march as it goes 
by." 
</P>
<P>
Vargas believes there is little reason to worry about violence. "We did have a 
march on the fifth-, ninth- and 10th-year anniversaries, and there was no 
violence," she said. In addition to police security, Vargas said, people from 
the community are being recruited to march and monitor participants in this 
year's protest. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as non-Latinos, the things we're fighting for are also for them. The 
opportunities we're calling for in education are also for their children too," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1970 East Los Angeles march made headlines when violence broke out between 
some marchers and law enforcement officers at the culminating rally at Laguna 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Before the trouble began, "It was a very good feeling, " Vargas said. "You came 
from there with a lot of self-esteem and pride." But then incidents at a nearby 
store and along the edge of the park escalated into a major confrontation. "The 
cops started coming up," Vargas said, "and we knew we had to get out of there." 
</P>
<P>
The chaos continued on neighboring streets, with marchers running for refuge in 
strangers' homes and residents watering down people who had been tear-gassed. 
</P>
<P>
Rioting erupted along Whittier Boulevard, where windows were smashed and fires 
were set in the battle between demonstrators and hundreds of Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies and Los Angeles police officers in riot gear. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar and two young Chicanos, Lynn Ward and Angel Diaz, were killed in the 
rioting and chaos. Two hundred people were arrested and $1 million in damages 
was reported. 
</P>
<P>
The 1970 events will be recalled by speakers on Aug. 25 as they attempt to put 
that era and its legacy into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1970 events, Chicano community activity increased with the formation 
of La Raza Unida political party, creation of numerous associations and 
involvement of more grass-roots groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexicanos had a great deal of hope and belief that their cause was right, 
their complaints were just and that by us coming together and getting organized 
. . . we were going to be able to make changes," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Acuna, a Cal State Northridge Chicano Studies professor, said many positive 
results arose from the Chicano movement. "People began to develop a mind-set 
that they could change things," Acuna said. "Before, they did not think they 
could." 
</P>
<P>
But even today, some say the conditions Chicanos fought 20 years ago have 
continued, if not worsened. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are still dropping out, they're still behind in getting into the 
university," said Belmont High teacher and counselor Sal Castro. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1968, 'Manual Labor' was a Mexican's first and last name. I don't think 
that's changed," said Castro, who led Chicano students in the 1968 "blowouts" 
in which thousands of Los Angeles Mexican-American high school students walked 
out of classes in protest of the educational conditions and the racism they 
said they faced from Anglo teachers and students. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, we did open up educational opportunities, asking for 
affirmative action and welfare rights," said Vargas, a mother of three sons. 
"But while we were opening doors, they were closing behind us for our 
children." 
</P>
<P>
"Today, everyone looks with great admiration at the countries of Eastern 
Europe. It's no different than what the Chicanos were doing," said Raul Ruiz, 
Cal State Northridge Chicano Studies professor and longtime Chicano activist. 
"Chicanos were simply struggling for democracy. Instead of it being covered up 
as unimportant, people should remember it." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said Latinos must continue to press for their rights if anything is to 
be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically it's the beginning of change," Martinez said. "I would not stand in 
any place today and say those complaints we had about police brutality, an 
unjust welfare system, and lack of educational opportunities have been fully 
addressed in California, Texas, and other states, but we have seen the 
beginning of change."

'AUGUST 29' DRAMA TO EXPLORE COURSE OF CHICANO MOVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYDIA RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deep in the hearts of Violeta Calles and Jose Luis Valenzuela lies the question 
of what happened to the Chicano movement. 
</P>
<P>
"August 29," written by Calles and directed by Valenzuela, will attempt to open 
the subject to audiences at the Los Angeles Theatre Center opening on Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The LATC's Latino Theatre Lab play, the first full length play by Calles, 
delves into this emotionally charged issue as its lead character, a Chicano 
Studies professor, must pull herself away from her academic shield to recall 
her past involvement and deal with her present indifference. 
</P>
<P>
Lucero Trevino, as the 35-year-old professor, "reflects a large sector of the 
Chicano community who are professionals because of the civil rights and Chicano 
movements . . . but are not involved in the present-day struggle," said Evelina 
Fernandez, a 12-year veteran actress reared in East Los Angeles, who plays the 
older Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
The university professor relives those late 1960s, early 1970s movement days 
while writing a book on the life of Los Angeles Times columnist Ruben Salazar, 
who was killed during the chaos of the Aug. 29, 1970, National Chicano 
Moratorium march and rioting. 
</P>
<P>
Although the play is set in 1990, the character of Salazar comes to life to aid 
the university professor recall the past and to challenge her to renew her 
involvement in the movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Ruben was a part of this community. He was a bridge between the average person 
on the street in the barrio and members of the intelligentsia," said E. J. 
Castillo, a 20-year veteran film and stage actor who plays Salazar. But, 
Castillo said, "He was not the only person killed that day (two others died). 
"We're trying to put that into perspective; what he was and what role he played 
in the movement itself." 
</P>
<P>
"August 29" will "hit home," said Valenzuela, who has directed at the Latino 
Lab for the last five years. He said it will also raise questions, such as 
"What happened to the Chicano community? What happened to East L.A.?" 
</P>
<P>
Researchers for the play interviewed key figures of the Chicano movement and 
others who have chronicled the events of Aug. 29, 1970. Calles herself, who was 
raised in East Los Angeles, was involved in the movement as a 15-year-old 
student. 
</P>
<P>
But Valenzuela stressed that "it's a fictitious story. It's not like a 
documentary. We're using (Aug. 29, 1970) as a launch date to the play." 
</P>
<P>
Latino Theatre Lab ensemble members Fernandez, Castillo, Sal Lopez, Angela Moya 
and Lupe Ontiveros, all of whom acted in the 1978 hit play "Zoot Suit," will 
perform five of the nine characters in the two-hour long play. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino Theatre Lab commissions playwrights, holds ensemble and young actors 
workshops and sponsors "new voices," a play-reading series. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Theatre Center, 514 S. Spring St., (213) 627-6500; Tickets 
$22-$27; group and student rates available; Previews begin Aug. 14. Special 
Chicano movement memorial performance Aug. 29. Regular performances from Aug. 
30 until Oct. 14.; Tuesday-Sunday at 8 p.m.; matinees Saturday and Sunday at 2 
p.m.

LA PLACITA'S BELOVED FORMER PASTOR LUIS OLIVARES AFFLICTED BY AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few days after he was found to have AIDS, and still weak from a serious bout 
with meningitis, Father Luis Olivares got up out of his hospital bed to keep a 
date with his parishioners at historic Our Lady Queen of Angels Church. 
</P>
<P>
It was to be his last Mass at La Placita, as the church is known to 
parishioners -- his despedida, or going away celebration. After nine years as 
pastor of the landmark downtown church, Olivares was to be transferred to 
another parish. The parishioners were aware that he had been ill but did not 
know of the AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares celebrated Mass from his wheelchair and gave a stirring homily. "The 
feeling between him and the people there was unbelievable," his former 
associate pastor, Father Mike Kennedy, said. "There wasn't a dry eye in the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares, who has crusaded tirelessly on behalf of his flock -- declaring La 
Placita a sanctuary for Central American refugees and for undocumented 
immigrants -- is now facing the toughest personal battle of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and sympathizers began rallying to his support while he was still at 
the hospital recovering from meningitis last month. In the course of treating 
him for the bacterial infection that attacks the brain and spinal cord, doctors 
discovered that he had the AIDS virus. Doctors said they believed that he 
contracted the disease from contaminated needles while undergoing treatment for 
other ailments in his travels in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares made the nature of his illness public soon after the Sunday Mass at La 
Placita. He did it, he said, to "let people know that anybody can get this 
disease and not to abandon those who happen to get it, regardless of how they 
contracted it." 
</P>
<P>
Flowers, posters and other expressions of support from his many friends in the 
community crowded his hospital room last month. A stream of visitors included 
union leader Cesar Chavez, actor Martin Sheen and Los Angeles Archbishop Roger 
M. Mahony. Later, in a statement, Mahony voiced sadness about Olivares' illness 
and admiration for his work. 
</P>
<P>
"Father Olivares has served the poorest of the poor here in Los Angeles with 
great commitment and courage, and he has aroused the conscience of us all as we 
try to understand our responsibilities toward newly arrived peoples and those 
whose lives are not sheltered by laws and protections," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that he and Olivares "have approached various social issues with 
different strategies at times," he added that they nevertheless share a 
commitment to "live out the Gospel." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares, who had been scheduled to report to a new parish in Ft. Worth, Tex., 
said his Claretian Order has released him from that obligation. He plans 
instead to live in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said it was impossible to predict how long Olivares will survive. But 
they said that, once the illness manifests itself in a serious infection as it 
had with Olivares, the patients generally live from two to six years longer. 
</P>
<P>
"Though it sounds very terminal, I haven't given up," a frail and unusually 
soft-spoken Olivares said. "I have a lot of hope." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Laurence Heifetz, Olivares' primary physician, said the priest had almost 
fully recovered from the meningitis when he was released from the hospital late 
last month. "We expect he'll get back to normal before the next manifestation 
of the HIV (AIDS virus) will hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Davida Coady, a professor of medicine at UCLA and a personal friend of 
Olivares', said, "We hope he will have several years of active life."

Olivares has traveled numerous times to Central America since 1984 to visit 
refugee camps and to meet with government and church officials. 
</P>
<P>
Coady, an expert on medicine in underdeveloped countries, said she checked with 
several clinics in El Salvador where Olivares had received treatment for 
various minor maladies related to his health problems, including diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
The physician said she is convinced that the priest was infected with the AIDS 
virus at a clinic six years ago where medication was injected, apparently with 
contaminated needles. Although she declined to provide further details about 
the clinic, citing confidentiality issues, she said she learned that other 
people have been infected with the AIDS virus at the same facility. Heifetz 
said he concurred with Coady's assessment.

LATINAS KEY PLAYERS FOR UCLA SOFTBALL CHAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Fernando Dominguez 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dynasty of sorts is in the making at UCLA, where the women's softball team 
recently won its third consecutive NCAA Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
Two players who contributed greatly this year were Lisa Fernandez and Yvonne 
Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, a freshman pitcher-third baseman out of St. Joseph High School in 
Lakewood, registered 11 victories in 12 decisions with a microscopic 0.64 ERA. 
She also hit .310 and knocked in 22 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez, a sophomore outfielder from Culver City High School, led the squad 
in batting at .384. She had 28 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Both were named All-Americans and were selected to the first-team All-Pac 10 
and College World Series squads. 
</P>
<P>
"We (the UCLA team) stuck together as a unit. I'm proud of that," Fernandez 
said. "We called it T.U. (Team Unity)." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez then went off as a pitcher for the U.S. team at the Women's World 
Championships in Illinois. Gutierrez, however, decided to take a sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing too much," Gutierrez commented. "I'm going to relax and 
pursue other goals this summer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All-Star Soccer Team Lined Up for L.A. 
</P>
<P>
On the heels of the World Cup, an international all-star soccer team is being 
lined up to meet a Mexican national squad at the Coliseum on Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the leading soccer players in the world have been asked to participate 
in the match, which will benefit the World Children's Transplant Fund, said 
organizer Horacio (Bumpy) Marco. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided we would take advantage of the hype of the World Cup," explained 
Marco, an Argentine-born member of the Los Angeles Police Department who has 
been affiliated with the fund since it was started five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a pretty good line on Rene Higuita (Colombia's national team 
goalkeeper) and we are trying to get (Diego) Maradona and Hugo Sanchez. We are 
also trying to get a couple of players from the U.S. team, like Paul 
Caligiuri." 
</P>
<P>
Caligiuri and his U.S. teammates didn't make it past the first round at the 
1990 World Cup in Italy, where they lost the three games they played. But 
there's hope for a better showing when the United States hosts the event in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, the Mexican superstar who recently won the scoring title in the 
Spanish league with Real Madrid, and Maradona, arguably the best player 
anywhere, would be exceptional attractions. 
</P>
<P>
The fund, Marco said, not only pays for the surgeries and other medical bills, 
but it covers all the expenses of children who receive organ transplants, the 
donors and their families. He said the operations are performed at Hospital 
Italiano in Buenos Aires by surgeons from different countries. 
</P>
<P>
"An operation there costs us $35,000," Marco said. "It would cost three times 
that much here." 
</P>
<P>
The game is scheduled for 8 p.m., with preliminary games between AYSO (American 
Youth Soccer Organization) teams at 5:30 p.m. and a celebrity game an hour 
later.

COUNCILWOMAN WANTS CITY TO BE NOTIFIED OF SPRAYING; 
</P>
<P>
PESTICIDE: A WEEKEND AERIAL APPLICATION OF MALATHION WAS LEGAL, BUT THE 
MOORPARK OFFICIAL SAYS PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW IF IT IS USED NEAR HOMES.

<P>
A helicopter spread malathion onto an onion field in Moorpark over the weekend, 
prompting a city councilwoman to urge that the city be notified of aerial 
spraying of pesticides. A low-flying helicopter hired by Boskovich Farms on 
Sunday sprayed 18 acres of onions in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials said the spraying was legal. But City Councilwoman 
Eloise Brown said she wants the city to be notified whenever the spraying 
threatens to expose Moorpark neighborhoods to chemical pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to know when they're spraying malathion," Brown said. She noted that 
there are homes next to the field that was sprayed and that residents could 
have been exposed without knowing it. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 acres of city-owned farmland is leased to Boskovich Farms, City 
Manager Steve Kueny said. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to use the land for a park, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aerial spraying is not restricted under the lease, but officials prefer that 
sprays be applied from the ground, Kueny said. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion is being used in parts of Southern California against the 
Mediterranean fruit fly, which hasn't made inroads into Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
It is not considered toxic by state and county agricultural officials. 
</P>
<P>
However, the aerial spraying has prompted protests in some neighborhoods in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Boskovich was spraying for a pinhead-sized bug called a thrip, said Dave 
Clarke, a pesticide control adviser for Boskovich. 
</P>
<P>
The pest attacks onion leaves and eventually kills the crop, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said Boskovich has used malathion once before on the field without 
attracting complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"Chances were that if it weren't malathion, we wouldn't have had any 
repercussions at all," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of malathion isn't restricted, and growers do not have to inform the 
county of their intention to spray with it. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,558 pounds of malathion is sprayed each year on Ventura County fields, 
some of which are located near homes, said Dave Buettner, the Ventura County 
deputy agricultural commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"Malathion is not a real hazard, particularly if it's applied properly," 
Buettner said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're never going to get away from that exposure potential when we live with 
agriculture and residential side by side," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The spray used on Boskovich's fields was more concentrated than that being used 
against the Medfly, Buettner added.

FEDERAL SUIT SEEKS BACK WAGES FOR 400 LABORERS; 
</P>
<P>
SOMIS: THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE PAY MIGHT EXCEED $1 MILLION. A RANCHER AND 7 
OTHERS ARE FACING SLAVERY CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit Wednesday seeking the back wages of an 
estimated 400 Mexican laborers who were allegedly held against their will and 
forced to toil for long hours by a Somis flower rancher. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, names the Griffith-Ives 
Co. of Somis and Edwin M. Ives, owner of the 50-acre ornament flower and 
greenery ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Ives, 53, his company, six ranch foremen and an alleged smuggler were indicted 
in May by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles. The jury filed a 15-count 
indictment, charging the defendants with enslaving more than 100 laborers, 
forcing them to work for sub-minimum wages and selling them food and sundries 
at inflated prices from a company store. 
</P>
<P>
Filed on behalf of Mexican laborers who worked on the ranch from 1987 to April 
of this year, the suit seeks unpaid back wages that could substantially exceed 
$1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The workers, some recruited from Mexican villages so rural that not even 
Spanish was spoken in them, said in interviews that they received about $1 an 
hour while routinely toiling 16 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Our initial investigation shows that as many as 400 workers, including many 
undocumented Mexican nationals, were grossly underpaid in violation of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act," Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole said in a statement. 
"This exploitation cannot be condoned, and we will seek to recover back wages 
and liquidated damages for these individuals." 
</P>
<P>
The suit accuses Ives and his company of failing to pay workers at least the 
federal minimum wage, which was $3.35 an hour between 1987 and April, when it 
was increased to $3.80 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Under the federal indictment, Ives could face up to 52 years in prison and $2 
million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Striegel, a spokesman for the Department of Labor, said his agency and 
the U.S. Department of Justice will cooperate in pursuing their separate cases 
by sharing information and witness testimony. He said the federal lawsuit could 
be tried within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Striegel said the lawsuit is intended to compensate all the workers, whether in 
the country or now in Mexico, regardless of their citizenship status. 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Talcott, attorney for Ives, said his investigation of the Justice 
Department's charges "failed to support any of the allegations." He called the 
Labor Department's lawsuit "absolutely redundant" and a "total misuse of 
taxpayers' resources." 
</P>
<P>
Ives also faces a lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles last month by 
California Rural Legal Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which names Ives, his wife Dolly, seven former ranch overseers and an 
alleged smuggler as defendants, invokes a federal anti-racketeering law that, 
if successful, could win 27 Mexican laborers damages three times the $300,000 
in back wages they claim to have lost. 
</P>
<P>
Marco Antonio Abarca, a legal-assistance attorney, said the addition of a 
second federal lawsuit helps his cause because it forces Ives to "spread out 
his resources to defend himself." 
</P>
<P>
While the Labor Department's suit attempts to recover back wages for former 
workers regardless of where they now reside, the suit by the legal-assistance 
group seeks only to compensate 27 laborers now living in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators estimate that the Somis farm employed about 100 workers a 
year. The lawsuit is the outgrowth of a joint investigation by the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Department of Labor and the FBI, 
Striegel said.

ST. MICHAEL'S IN POWAY GUTTED BY RAGING FIRE; CAUSE A MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spectacular two-alarm fire that shot flames and smoke into the sky like a 
volcano early Wednesday demolished St. Michael's Catholic Church in Poway. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was estimated at more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Firemen were called to the scene at 7:13 a.m. after a parishioner who was 
dropping off newspapers in a recycling bin noticed smoke coming from the church 
building. The sanctuary had been closed to worshipers since Monday so that the 
interior walls and ceiling could be repainted. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the fire apparently started in the center of the church 
sanctuary, building up heat that blew out the east and south sides of the 
800-seat structure and sending flames shooting through a glass skylight above 
the altar as in a volcano. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty much gone when we arrived," said Poway Battalion Chief Garry 
MacPherson. He said 11 firefighting units from Poway and San Diego responded, 
but "there was very little we could do except keep the fire from spreading to 
surrounding buildings." 
</P>
<P>
MacPherson said that Sheriff's Department arson investigators were called in 
but were unable to determine the point of origin or cause of the fire because 
of the instability of the collapsed structure. He said the arched roof of the 
building collapsed, "and we decided not to risk the safety of the firefighters" 
by sending them in to extinguish smoldering sections of the structure. 
</P>
<P>
He said no injuries were reported in fighting the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case where the structure might have been saved if there had been a 
sprinkler system installed in the building," MacPherson said. But the building 
was constructed in 1971, before Poway was incorporated and before county 
building codes required sprinkler installation in large buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire gutted the 5,000-square-foot structure and an attached kindergarten 
classroom at the rear. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought for a while that they could save the classroom but then the whole 
roof collapsed," said the Rev. Daniel Finn, associate pastor at St. Michael's. 
</P>
<P>
Finn arrived at the Pomerado Road church about 7 a.m. to prepare for a 7:30 
a.m. Mass at the nearby church meeting hall, where church services were being 
held while the sanctuary interior was being painted. 
</P>
<P>
"When I stepped outside for a breather about 15 minutes later, I heard voices 
shouting, 'Fire!' and I ran to the church," Finn said. "I looked in and saw 
that the place was full of flames and smoke, and I warned people to get out of 
the way, that the whole place looked as if it was going to blow." 
</P>
<P>
Painters who had been refurbishing the sanctuary since Monday told firemen that 
they were using only water-based and other non-combustible cleaning solvents in 
their work, Finn said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how it started, and there have been no incidents of any kind 
that would lead one to suspect arson," Finn added. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Jack Davidson said that "any time a church burns, it's 
suspicious. There is nothing in a church that you would normally expect to be 
responsible for a fire, like a stove or oven or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Poway fire officials nor sheriff's arson investigators would comment 
further until after a complete investigation. 
</P>
<P>
MacPherson said that, probably by mid-day today, steel girders and other debris 
will be removed and investigators will be able to pinpoint where the fire 
started. 
</P>
<P>
Finn said services will continue to be held in the church's social hall until 
the sanctuary is rebuilt. Rebuilding will begin immediately, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze did not spread to a nearby eight-room school or to other offices, a 
chapel, a convent and other buildings on the site, which is across Pomerado 
Road from Pomerado Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. Charles Dollen, pastor of St. Gabriel's Catholic Church in Poway, said 
that St. Michael's is the "mother church" for four or five other parishes in 
Poway, Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Penasquitos and Carmel Mountain Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"For many years, St. Michael's was the only Catholic church in the area between 
San Diego and Escondido," Dollen said. He said St. Michael's pastor, Msgr. 
Joseph Finnerty, is in Ireland.

WHITE HOUSE BACKS QUADRIPLEGIC'S JOB-TRAINING PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN LOEWENTHAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Krebs, a quadriplegic and budding entrepreneur in Newbury Park, has won 
White House support for a plan to wean other disabled people from welfare and 
disability insurance by helping them get back to work. 
</P>
<P>
A leader in the disabled rights movement, Krebs has been a frequent guest at 
the White House. But two weeks ago a White House official called, asking Krebs 
to hurry with a proposal to set up job-training workshops for the disabled at 
area colleges. 
</P>
<P>
The official, George Covington of Vice President Dan Quayle's staff, wanted the 
proposal in hand today, when President Bush signs the Americans With 
Disabilities Act. Years in the making, the disabilities act guarantees the 43 
million physically and mentally disabled Americans the same job rights and 
access to public facilities as other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"The White House is going to try to find the money for us," said Krebs, who 
owns a mail-order business that sells sports and recreational equipment adapted 
for disabled people. His sports line includes such varied items as bowling 
balls with spring-loaded handles and sling-seats for disabled water-skiers. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Krebs and his partner, A. Gregory Stone, have proposed a plan to 
help the disabled use existing government programs to secure job training, job 
placement or gain skills to start their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Don represents the best of the movement," Covington said, "in which the 
disabled are playing a big part in setting policy on disability issues. We want 
to encourage people outside of Washington to come up with proposals to solve 
the problems we here in Washington haven't been able to solve." 
</P>
<P>
Covington could not say if Krebs' project would receive the $600,000 requested 
annually for five years. But he said it is being considered by the Small 
Business Administration and Social Security Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a proposal . . . long been needed," Covington said. "It brings together 
the Small Business Administration, which now has tremendous interest in 
assisting the handicapped, with entrepreneurial projects." 
</P>
<P>
Krebs is amply qualified to teach other disabled people how to become 
entrepreneurs. His own business, Access to Recreation, began as a project for a 
master of business administration course at California Lutheran University's 
Center for Entrepreneurship. Krebs essentially created a mock version of his 
catalogue company. 
</P>
<P>
Two and a half years ago, Krebs turned his concept into a working business. 
Last year, Access to Recreation sent catalogues to 25,000 disabled people 
worldwide. Although the business has yet to turn a profit, Krebs sees a 
promising beginning. He anticipates that this year's gross sales will reach 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"They teach in business school that it takes three to five years for a new 
business to show a profit," said Krebs, who lives off Social Security payments. 
"But I'm encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the Social Security Administration's work incentive programs that 
helped Krebs launch his business, providing about two-thirds of the money. The 
program allows Social Security recipients to collect benefits while they save 
their earnings for education, vocational training or starting a business. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Krebs wrote a letter explaining his troubles as a disabled person 
using little-known government assistance programs to establish a small 
business. The letter was sent to President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The President was impressed. He asked Krebs to submit recommendations to the 
President's Disability Advisory Council on removing barriers that discourage 
recipients of Social Security Insurance and Disability Insurance from pursuing 
gainful employment. 
</P>
<P>
With Stone's help, Krebs developed his proposal to set up the training 
workshops at the University of Southern California, UCLA, Cal State Northridge 
and Moorpark College. 
</P>

"Of the people who become disabled and enter the Social Security Disability 
Program, only 5% go back to work," Krebs said. Polls show that about two-thirds 
of working-age Americans with disabilities were unemployed, and yet most said 
they would rather work than collect welfare, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Such statistics have a personal meaning for Krebs, 35, who broke his neck 12 
years ago during a water-skiing competition. He remains paralyzed from the 
chest down with only limited use of his fingers. Of the 80 people in his 
rehabilitation group, he is one of only three now working. 
</P>
<P>
"I know so many quadriplegics -- in the prime of their work life -- who have 
got college degrees, but sit home and watch television because they are afraid 
to lose their medical benefits if they try to work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are 15,662 disabled adults and children in Ventura County receiving 
Social Security Insurance and Disability benefits, said Joe Giglio of the 
Social Security Administration. 
</P>
<P>
And Covington said there are 2.5 million disabled college students nationally, 
an eightfold increase over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Krebs hopes that his proposed project can bridge government hurdles by combing 
all government programs that can be used to train the disabled for employment. 
</P>
<P>
"Even now," Krebs said, "most people who advise the disabled at various 
colleges and government programs are not aware of opportunities for making the 
transition to the work force."

The Sister Cities International Convention in Albuquerque this weekend will not 
be attended by one of L.A.'s municipal kin: Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
While it's on L.A.'s list of 17 sister cities, the Iranian capital is 
designated as "temporarily suspended." The "temporary" suspension has been in 
effect since the Iranian demonstrators took U.S. hostages in 1979.

<P>
In its recent "Best Bets" issue, the Downtown News gave "Most Mysterious 
Object" honors to a 15-feet-tall crimson cone that's perched on a tripod in the 
northwest corner of Pershing Square. 
</P>
<P>
The News appealed to readers to identify the conehead contraption (see photo) 
but none have done so. 
</P>
<P>
Was it left there (1) by an ancient civilization, (2) by an off-beat religious 
sect, or, perhaps, (3) by a fan of "Saturday Night Live"? 
</P>
<P>
Our phone calls to Pershing Square's garage and to the city Department of 
Recreation and Parks on Wednesday failed to produce an answer. But Only in L.A. 
vows to press on with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
When we solve the mystery, we plan to celebrate by holding a barbecue under the 
cone. 
</P>
<P>
Spiders are crawling all over the city's movie screens in "Arachnophobia," but 
a 3-foot-long snake, a tarantula and three iguanas are missing in real life 
from a Reseda house. Police are treating it as a theft, rather than a mass 
break-out.

The Curse of Thousand Oaks: 
</P>
<P>
Amid the controversy over the Raiders, another pro football team has quietly 
rejected Southern California. For nearly 30 years, the Dallas Cowboys practiced 
during the pre-season in Thousand Oaks, prompting the proud city to install 
signs calling itself the club's "Summer Home." 
</P>
<P>
But the Cowboys said they wanted a place with hotter weather. So, they chose 
Austin, Tex., as their sister-city. Guess what? It rained during the Cowboys' 
first seven days there. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've found L.A.'s newest nude beach," said Tom LaBonge, a City Council 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
He was showing a Berlin official the sights when they came upon a man sunning 
himself at water's edge in his birthday suit. 
</P>
<P>
And where is this risque spot, which is likely to draw thousands of unclad 
bathers and gawkers after its mention here? 
</P>
<P>
"The L.A. River," said LaBonge, "under the 4th Street bridge."

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE; 
</P>
<P>
CITY WON'T OPPOSE MERGER OF 2 UTILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Fillmore City Council will not join four other Ventura County cities that 
oppose a proposed merger between Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas 
&amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided Tuesday that the issues were best handled by officials at 
the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District board. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the board, Edison has until 1996 to reduce pollution 
caused by the proposed merger. Consolidation of the two utilities would shift 
the load of electrical generation from San Diego plants to facilities in 
Ventura County, which burn less fuel to produce electricity. 
</P>
<P>
While fostering efficiency, the move would also increase pollution in Ventura 
County as local plants expand production. 
</P>
<P>
Edison has promised to comply with pollution reduction measures outlined by the 
control board. Edison representatives said at Tuesday's meeting that Ventura 
County will eventually enjoy improved air quality as a result of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
New pollution controls will be applied to generating facilities at Mandalay and 
Ormond beaches. Edison has also agreed to reduce emissions from other 
industries to offset increased pollution produced by the electrical plants. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Simi Valley, Oxnard, Ojai and Ventura have opposed even a 
temporary increase in pollution and labeled the agreement premature. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore residents and environmental groups urged the council to oppose the 
merger. Ventura County ranks sixth in the nation for air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore's council turned down a staff recommendation to demand that pollution 
control measures be in place before the merger. However, the city will 
officially protest the failure of the pollution control board to consult cities 
before making the agreement. JANET BERGAMO

PANEL URGES BUILDING OF REGIONAL CRIME LAB; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: FACILITY TO PROCESS CRIMINAL EVIDENCE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN 
COUNTY WOULD COST $22 MILLION TO $27 MILLION TO CONSTRUCT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County's local governments should pool their resources to build a 
regional crime lab for analyzing evidence, members of a select committee 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The lab, which could provide service to all of the law enforcement agencies 
within the county, would cost $22 million to $27 million, according to Dist. 
Atty. Ed Miller and San Diego City Councilman Ron Roberts, both members of the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
A jointly operated crime lab could process tests from evidence faster and more 
cost-effectively than the labs now operated by the San Diego Police Department 
and the county Sheriff's Department, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have criminals, up to and including murderers, who are remaining on the 
streets because of the time lag at crime labs," Roberts said. "We've got to 
change that." 
</P>
<P>
The regional lab proposal is subject to the approval of the county and each of 
the cities. That means that the lab probably wouldn't be built before 1993, 
Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
As a first step toward building the jointly operated lab, the committee 
recommended that the county and cities share the costs of acquiring three 
pieces of high-tech equipment. 
</P>
<P>
That equipment, estimated to cost $880,000 annually to operate and maintain, 
would allow law enforcement officers to analyze "genetic fingerprints," gunshot 
residue and minute fragments of fabric taken from crime scenes, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which included representatives from the San Diego Police 
Department and the sheriff's office, made its recommendation after having 
studied the issue since March. 
</P>
<P>
The regional lab should be housed in a 100,000- to 125,000-square-foot building 
and include the latest high-tech analytic equipment, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the public has become more knowledgeable about sophisticated 
evidence-gathering methods, it is especially important for law enforcement 
agencies to keep their facilities up-to-date, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
When jury members know that it's possible to gather DNA -- "genetic 
fingerprints" -- from a crime scene, they become suspicious when such evidence 
isn't presented at a trial, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials have kicked around the idea of building a regional crime 
lab for almost 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he has advocated a regional lab since 1971, but the idea never 
became reality because of a "vigorous turf battle" between the city and county. 
</P>
<P>
The rising cost of lab equipment has changed that, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Rivalries you can only afford up to a point," Roberts said. "I think that 
we've reached that point." 
</P>
<P>
Under the committee's plan, the city of San Diego would pay about 52% of the 
lab's building cost, the county would pay about 22% and each of the smaller 
cities that now use the sheriff's lab would pay a share based on their 
populations and crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
The $6-million annual operating cost of the lab would be similarly divided, 
Miller said.

AL MARTINEZ: NOTES ON THE LADY IN STRIPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's nothing like a celebrity court case to bring out the crowds. Fatty 
Arbuckle proved that a long time ago and Christian Brando is proving it now. If 
they get any more popular, they're going to have to be held in the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Give us a murder, a rape, a dope bust or even a slap in a cop's choppers, and 
we gather like hungry buzzards at an auto-da-fe, provided, of course, the 
carrion in the case has what is known in Hollywood as A Name. 
</P>
<P>
The elements of these trials are compelling: pretty women, handsome men, 
expensive criminal lawyers, massive media coverage, violence buffs, groupies by 
the gross . . . and, of course, the mysterious Lady in Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
In the Brando case, we are additionally blessed with the Great Brooding 
Presence of Christian's father, Marlon Brando Himself, elevating the 
proceedings to a spiritual level that ordinary murder trials rarely attain. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the preliminary hearing the other day, he pleased the crowd by 
closing his eyes and extending his hands as though meditating. It was pure 
Brando. 
</P>
<P>
He somehow continues to come across as the mystical Col. Kurtz in "Apocalypse 
Now." 
</P>
<P>
One sees him lying in semi-darkness in the steamy jungles of Vietnam, speaking 
in a characteristic hoarse whisper to the spirits of the dead, as a cow is 
killed nearby in ceremonial sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
What a scene. Hold on the cow. Come up with the wailing spirits. Cut to the 
Great Brooding Presence and fade out. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful. That's a take. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to minimize the seriousness of what's going on here. A man is dead 
and Christian Brando, if convicted of his murder, could spend a long time in 
the slammer. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a quality of carnival to a celebrity case that is difficult to 
ignore. 
</P>
<P>
You already know, I suppose, that Christian is accused of killing Dag Drollet 
last May 16. He believed Drollet was beating Cheynne Brando, who was Drollet's 
woman, as they say, and Christian's half-sister. 
</P>
<P>
There may or may not have been an argument between Christian and Dag, and they 
may or may not have struggled for a gun that may or may not have accidentally 
fired, but one thing's for sure. Dag is dead. 
</P>
<P>
As defense attorney Robert Shapiro put it, Christian was enraged because "a 
loved one (pause), a sister (pause), a little sister (pause), a little pregnant 
sister (pause) was desperate." 
</P>
<P>
Then: "He reacted as any brother would." Well, almost any brother. 
</P>
<P>
I caught only a snippet of the hearing but was left with no doubt that this was 
A Name on trial. 
</P>
<P>
You knew it by the portable TV cameras lined up on the floor outside the 
courtroom, like a row of electronic Howitzers waiting to be fired. 
</P>
<P>
You knew it when you entered the courtroom itself and a bailiff searched your 
briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
You knew it by the frantic note-taking of the reporters, by the 
standing-room-only crowd . . . and by the mysterious Lady in Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yeah . . . her. 
</P>
<P>
There's one at every celebrity trial. They seem to know everyone involved and 
chronicle every word of the proceedings, but never reveal their identity. 
</P>
<P>
It would be more lyrical had the woman in question worn red, since a mysterious 
Lady in Red is shrouded in the kind of aura a Lady in Stripes lacks, but you 
take what you get. 
</P>
<P>
She was a dark-haired, gum-chewing person in her mid-30s who took notes 
enthusiastically. I was sitting next to her and, during a break, she asked the 
equivalent of did I come here often? 
</P>
<P>
Then, without further preamble, she established her mysterious nature by 
refusing to give her name before I asked. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
"Do you come here often?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, not exactly, I'm a, you know, journalist." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't give you my name." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh . . . OK." 
</P>
<P>
"Or why I'm taking notes." 
</P>
<P>
"No problem." 
</P>
<P>
"But I can tell you I know a lot of what's going on here. I'm a friend of 
Christian's girlfriends." 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, ha." 
</P>
<P>
"They're all Pisces." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course." 
</P>
<P>
I had a little trouble concentrating on the Mysterious Lady in Stripes, because 
in addition to chewing gum, which was expressly forbidden in court, she giggled 
mindlessly. Another for instance: 
</P>
<P>
"That's (chew, chew) Christian's best friend's (chew, chew) ex-wife (giggle) 
over there (chew, giggle). They used to (chew) date (giggle)." 
</P>
<P>
I left her in mid-giggle because I was afraid I might snap and do her harm. I 
punched a woman once who chewed and giggled simultaneously and have never 
forgiven myself. 
</P>
<P>
"Pay no mind," she said, picking herself up. "It's what any son would have 
done." 
</P>
<P>
What a swell mom.

REDONDO COUNCIL LEERY THAT EYESORE BILL IS TOO NOSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peppered with complaints about neighborhood eyesores, the Redondo Beach City 
Council ordered the city staff last year to draft a comprehensive property 
maintenance ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
But council members blanched when the proposal was unveiled Tuesday night and 
they found it would regulate everything from the pruning of trees to the 
placement of clotheslines. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very nervous about this ordinance," said Councilman Terry Ward. "We don't 
want something that is Big Brother looking down everyone's throat." 
</P>
<P>
Said Councilwoman Barbara Doerr: "I want this ordinance burned as a public 
nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
City leaders decided to table the measure and consult residents on what to do 
to deal with property maintenance problems. They did so sheepishly, admitting 
that the city staff had given them what they had asked for. 
</P>
<P>
"They did exactly what we directed them to do," Mayor Brad Parton said. "But 
when we saw the direction we were going, we got a little nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's proposal would have prohibited a wide range of neighborhood 
"nuisances," untrimmed hedges, unpruned trees and grass that exceeds six inches 
in height. 
</P>
<P>
It would bar residents from stringing clotheslines in front or side yards or on 
porches or balconies, and would require them to keep dirt, lumber, concrete, 
refrigerators, stoves and other "rubbish or junk" out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
Inoperative automobiles, trailers, campers and boats would have to be stored in 
buildings. And auto repair work visible from roads or neighboring property 
would be out of bounds unless done in an emergency or for minor maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The city already has property regulations addressing such areas as public 
safety and health. For instance, roofs have to be cleared of combustible leaves 
and branches, and lots must be kept free of stagnant water where mosquitoes can 
breed. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say many provisions of the proposed ordinance would involve them 
in purely aesthetic concerns, such as outdoor clotheslines and the dimensions 
of hedges. 
</P>
<P>
City planning chief Paul Connolly said Tuesday the ordinance was modeled on 
laws used successfully in cities elsewhere in the state. But council members 
said they would have a hard time stomaching the wide-ranging measure unveiled 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Several Redondo Beach residents warned that voters would take a dim view of it, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"This really raises hairs on the back of my neck," said Frank O'Leary, who 
lives on Prospect Avenue. "(This) is just another loss of individual liberty. 
This is another little forfeiture of our freedom." 
</P>
<P>
The momentum for some form of property ordinance has been provided by a steady 
stream of complaints. Connolly said Redondo Beach last year received 1,600 
property-related complaints, many of them concerning neighborhood eyesores of 
the type addressed by the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The problems range from cannibalized automobiles and car parts littering front 
yards to leaves blowing from a property owner's hedge into a neighbor's pool. 
According to the city staff, the problem of automobile clutter comes up often, 
but the city has little legal authority to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult," said Mike Magdaleno, a city code-enforcement officer. 
"We usually have to go the route of seeing if they are conducting a (car 
repair) business out of their residence, which is illegal. But that is hard to 
find out." 
</P>
<P>
Ward says he and other council members field numerous complaints from residents 
who feel nearby eyesores are eroding their neighborhood's property values and 
living standards. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems usually come down to rentals, people who don't own the property 
and don't care about their neighbors," he said Wednesday. "And often the 
landowner doesn't care either. He's just sitting on (the property), waiting for 
the day he can reap his reward." 
</P>
<P>
Council members agreed Tuesday to seek guidance on how to handle the property 
maintenance issue in meetings with constituents. One option several of them 
suggested is to sharpen the existing property maintenance regulations, not to 
create new ones. 
</P>
<P>
Fears of excessive government control have clearly dampened the council's 
enthusiasm for a more aggressive approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is the judge, who is holier-than-thou to say 'this is bad,' and 'this is 
good?' " Ward asked. "Certainly not me. . . . I'm the last person to push Big 
Brother down somebody's throat."

MOVE OF OCEANSIDE SOUP KITCHEN OKD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brother Benno's soup kitchen in Oceanside has won city approval to move from 
downtown, where it has caused controversy, to an industrial area near the 
Oceanside Municipal Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission voted, 7-0, Monday night to let the 6-year-old kitchen 
relocate and begin new services, including job counseling, showers, a day room 
and substance abuse therapy. 
</P>
<P>
However, the commission required Brother Benno's, which is run by a nonprofit 
foundation, to follow strict rules to make sure its patrons do not loiter 
around nearby businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Despite receiving acclaim, the existing Brother Benno's kitchen on Minnesota 
Street, where 225 dinners a night are served, has drawn criticism that drunks 
and loiterers have burglarized and littered. RAY TESSLER

A report released this week concludes that student demonstrations this spring 
at Hawthorne and Leuzinger high schools were organized by teachers, 
administrators and security officers who were trying to prevent the newly 
elected school board from taking an active role in district business. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report was hailed by Trustee Pam Sturgeon and the board's 
supporters as a first step toward getting to the bottom of what happened during 
the demonstrations, it came under immediate fire by board critics who said its 
allegations are unsubstantiated and that it unfairly targets blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy McKee, who has two daughters in the district, said she believes the 
report "is going to start the healing process" by rooting out those people who 
were responsible for the walkouts. "I think it's positive because they're going 
to be able to clean out the bad seeds." 
</P>
<P>
But board critic Adrain Briggs disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a waste of time and money, and all of it was focused on trying to find 
black folks in violation of something," said Briggs, a spokesman for the 
Committee for Racial Free Education, a group of black parents and other 
community activists who have been critical of the predominantly Latino school 
board. "It doesn't have any validity whatsoever, and those charges wouldn't 
stand up in a court of law." 
</P>
<P>
However, Sturgeon said the report is preliminary and that she is confident the 
investigator who wrote it has evidence to back up his findings. She said the 
board will take no action on the report until the investigation is complete. 
</P>
<P>
William Burnett, the private investigator who wrote the report, was hired by 
Centinela Valley Union High School District trustees to look into suspicions 
that students were not responsible for organizing the March 5-6 walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the demonstrations, several students said they decided to walk 
out of class to protest a spate of racially motivated incidents that had 
plagued the district and to show their support for Kenneth Crowe, the principal 
of Hawthorne High. Crowe was reassigned to a teaching position earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
But some teachers and others said most of the students joined the 
demonstrations simply to get out of class and that few students at Leuzinger 
High, where the protest marches began, even knew the name of the principal at 
Hawthorne, the rival high school. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the investigation, Burnett set up a toll-free phone number to allow 
people with information about the walkouts to call in anonymously. Although 
Burnett provided the trustees with the names of the district employees who 
allegedly organized the walkouts, those names were not included in the 
four-page report that was made public. 
</P>
<P>
The report also did not identify the sources of the allegations nor the 
documents that reportedly backed them up. Nor did it indicate the number of 
people who called in anonymously or the number of those who agreed to be 
interviewed in person. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett said in his report that interviews he conducted and documents he 
obtained during the inquiry led him to conclude that "the students did not act 
independently" in walking out of school and that they were instead "used by 
some employees of the school district to focus attention on the position of the 
principal of Hawthorne High School, and upon allegations of racism that had 
been raised during the previous election of the board of trustees." 
</P>
<P>
The investigator also said he found evidence that "confidential school records 
were released to outside interests and that school district equipment was used 
to produce inflammatory material that was passed out during the 
demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
Burnett cited 12 "reported incidents" that he said supported his conclusion 
that district employees planned the student walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are reports that two teachers tried to recruit other teachers to 
help organize the walkouts, that teachers helped distribute pamphlets that were 
handed out during the demonstrations, that the handwriting on one leaflet 
appeared to match that of a teacher, and that a student had been observed 
taking pamphlets out of the trunk of a car belonging to a faculty member. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he reported statements by security officers that they had been 
told that a district administrator had approved the walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said several security officers were observed passing out 
handouts and that on the morning of the demonstrations they were told that 
"they were to encourage students to participate" in the walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne High Security Officer Cynthia Henderson, who said she was falsely 
accused of passing out pamphlets by two other officers after the walkouts, 
called the allegations lies and said the only pamphlets she ever saw were the 
ones brought into the morning meeting by one of her accusers. 
</P>
<P>
The report also alleges that a four-page handout passed out during the 
demonstration contained facts that were unavailable to students and "could only 
be found in the School District Administrative Offices." 
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet, which was titled "A Failure to Stop the Lynching," contained 
several examples of alleged racist incidents against black employees and 
students. Board critic Briggs, who said he and other members of his 
organization wrote the pamphlet, denied that district employees in any way 
provided them with information for the pamphlet. The information, he said, came 
from newspaper reports and parents who "know a lot more than you think they 
know." 
</P>
<P>
The report also says that a district official had given a speech to students a 
few days before the walkouts that was "racially inflammatory and was intended 
to incite the students." 
</P>
<P>
Although the report does not name the official, former Supt. McKinley Nash, who 
was fired from his post last week, said in an interview Wednesday that the 
allegation refers to a comment he made during an assembly on Black History 
Month. The Rev. Chet Gean, who is white, had spoken about racial integration in 
the South. At the end of the assembly, a student asked Gean how he would feel 
if his daughter dated a black man. Another student then questioned whether 
racism existed anymore, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
"I came forward and told the youngsters it was unfair to attack anybody because 
of their place of birth or their race and that racism exists everywhere in 
America and among all groups, regardless of their race," Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
Social studies teacher Arnold Tena, who was present during the assembly and who 
is a strong critic of Nash, said he disagreed with some of his colleagues that 
Nash's comments were inflammatory. But he said that he still believed Nash 
played a role in the walkouts, an allegation Nash denies. 
</P>
<P>
Nash, who said his attorney is preparing a written response to the report, said 
Burnett never answered his requests for an interview and that "some of the 
facts he alleges are incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
He said he sent Burnett information concerning about 20 incidents in which 
students contended that they had been harassed by teachers and staff members 
before, during and after the walkouts. He said the documents might have shown a 
motivation for the students to walk out, but they were sent back to him 
accompanied by a letter by Trustee Ruth Morales telling him that Burnett would 
not investigate those incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon said Burnett was hired solely to investigate the walkout, and there 
are district procedures for handling harassment complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said the report troubled him because individuals "could be falsely accused 
and not be given the right for redress and to defend themselves." 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned about any report that does not name people and does not give 
people the ability to react, and for that reason that is frightening to me." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement attached to the report, the trustees said they planned to use 
the report to determine whether they will pursue "criminal or other 
disciplinary action" against any employee found to have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) said in an interview Wednesday that the 
report "is not supported by the facts or any due process" and that he had 
warned the trustees last month that they could be opening themselves up to 
lawsuits if they use the report's findings to dismiss any employees from the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
An assessment of the district's racial tensions is due to be released soon by 
the state Department of Education's Office of Intergroup Relations. In 
addition, the federal Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is 
investigating allegations of racial harassment in the district.

COLLEGE BOARD OKS EMPLOYEE CONTRACTS

<P>
The Board of Trustees of the Ventura County Community College District has 
approved agreements with three employee groups whose members had been working 
without contracts since July 1, district officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting Tuesday, the board approved a three-year contract with the 
Service Employees International Union Local 535, which represents 400 
secretaries, maintenance workers, librarians, laboratory technicians and other 
classified employees. 
</P>
<P>
About three-fourths of the union's 200 members had voted to ratify the 
agreement last week. 
</P>
<P>
The classified employee contract includes a 3% pay raise retroactive to July 1, 
and another 3% increase effective in January, district officials said. The 
employees will also receive a raise of up to 4% in July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the board approved two-year contracts with the 50-member Certified 
Management Assn., which includes vice chancellors, college vice presidents and 
deans, and with the 12-member confidential employee group, including the 
secretaries to the chancellor and to the college presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Both contracts with the smaller groups include 5% pay increases retroactive to 
July 1 and a 4% increase effective July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In closed session Tuesday, district officials also discussed continuing 
negotiations with teachers and classified employee supervisors, officials said.

PRIVATE MEETINGS FORCE NEW VOTE ON BILTMORE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An apparent violation of the state open meetings law has added yet another 
chapter to the long-running saga of Hermosa Beach's quest to find a new use for 
the Biltmore site on The Strand. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Roger Creighton, Mayor Pro Tem Chuck Sheldon and Councilman Robert 
Essertier took part in separate private discussions -- what are sometimes 
called serial meetings -- about a new proposal for the site, the three said at 
Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Inadvertently and unintelligently, we have -- as far as the public is 
concerned -- a violation of the Brown Act," Creighton said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state Brown Act, closed meetings to discuss city business are 
prohibited except in special circumstances, including personnel matters and 
land acquisition. Such closed meetings may include serial meetings, in which 
enough council members to form a majority discuss city business in separate 
private discussions. 
</P>
<P>
The flap about the private discussions comes two weeks after the council took 
steps to end a controversy that has dogged the city since the old Biltmore 
Hotel was torn down in 1965. The site, a little less than an acre on the beach 
between 14th and 15th street, has become a weed-choked vacant lot. 
</P>
<P>
On July 10, the council voted 3-2 to sell the lot for residential development 
and begin the uncertain process of applying to the Coastal Commission for the 
necessary permits. City officials estimated that the city would net between $8 
million to $10 million from the sale. The plan was to use the money to buy 
parkland elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
But the council decided Tuesday that the discussions in the past week involving 
Creighton, Essertier and Sheldon require reopening the matter for a public 
hearing and a new vote because any future council decision on the matter might 
be tainted by the Brown Act violation. A public hearing is scheduled for Aug. 
14. 
</P>
<P>
Creighton said that he became concerned about a possible Brown Act violation on 
Tuesday when Essertier called him and brought up the latest idea for the site. 
Sheldon said he also had discussions with Essertier about the proposal, which 
has not yet been formally presented to the council. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal -- a compromise between the city's plans for housing and a 
rejected proposal to make the entire area into a park -- was to split the 
property into a park on The Strand with housing behind the park. 
</P>
<P>
Creighton said he immediately cut off his conversation with Essertier after the 
councilman brought up the proposal. The mayor said he then contacted City 
Manager Kevin Northcraft, who checked with the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Creighton said he decided to raise the matter at the council meeting "as soon 
as the city manager told me I was involved in a potential or possible . . . 
violation of the Brown Act." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Edward Lee advised the council to reopen the public 
hearing on the Biltmore site. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate like hell to be in a position to back up," Creighton said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Albert Wiemans, who favors a park on the site, said he does not 
mind reopening the public hearing at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to the public input," he said. "The more, the merrier."

SIMI VALLEY SCHOOLS SHOW OFF IMPROVEMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
REHABILITATION: VOTER APPROVAL OF $35 MILLION IN BONDS HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR 
THE FIRST PHASE OF RENOVATIONS AT 11 OF 26 CAMPUSES IN THE DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It has not been a good year for the Simi Valley Unified School District, which 
has endured $8 million in budget cuts, a fire at an elementary school and the 
recent announcement that its superintendent will resign in September. 
</P>
<P>
But it has not been all bad. On Wednesday, district officials took the 
opportunity to show off various school improvement projects under way at 11 of 
the district's 26 campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The improvements, the first of a three-phase renovation program, are being 
financed with $35 million provided by a bond measure approved by voters in 
March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the major renovations include installation of computerized sprinkler 
systems and installation or replacement of air-conditioning and heating 
systems. Other improvements include repainting and recarpeting at some schools, 
and the addition of handicapped ramps and restrooms at others. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the program is to rehabilitate classrooms from a deteriorating 
condition to a very functional and appealing" environment in which to learn and 
work, said Henry Needham, the district's coordinator of construction and 
environmental management. 
</P>
<P>
Park View School, which lost four classrooms in a fire in May, is undergoing 
the most extensive renovation. Workers are installing an air-conditioning and 
heating system as well as new plumbing. New floors and a new roof are also part 
of the package. 
</P>
<P>
The elementary school is also being repainted. Its colors, beige and blue, are 
giving way to lighter tones of green and burgundy. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Beth Wolford, assistant superintendent of business and property 
management, said the district had decided to renovate Park View before the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It had the most needs," Wolford said of the 27-year-old campus. "Plus it was 
centrally located, and we wanted the residents of the community who supported 
the bond measure to visually see something happening. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to take one school and sort of make it a model of what can happen 
when we modernize and completely redo the entire school." 
</P>
<P>
Wolford said the renovation is scheduled to be completed by Sept. 4. The 
fire-damaged classrooms, which are being rebuilt with insurance money, are 
expected to be finished by December. 
</P>
<P>
Grading is under way for a new multipurpose building at Hollow Hills 
Fundamental School. The building will be used as a cafeteria, auditorium and 
storage area, Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
The old multipurpose room, which is being converted into two classrooms, was so 
small that five lunch periods were scheduled to accommodate the school's 660 
students, Wolford said. The school will now have the option of scheduling one 
or two lunch periods, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers are also installing computerized sprinkler systems at a number of 
campuses, including Santa Susana, Simi Valley and Big Springs elementary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The systems include moisture sensors that will automatically regulate the flow 
of water. They are expected to save about 30% of the water now being used, said 
Gary Nottingham, the district's maintenance supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Needham said all of the projects are on schedule and should be completed by 
early September.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAPD RESPONDS WITH NEW SUBSTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department opened a new substation in the Harbor Gateway 
on Wednesday in an effort to increase police patrols in the narrow city strip, 
which residents complain receives inadequate protection. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the substation will be used by officers patrolling the 
Harbor Gateway to write reports, make phone calls and perform other 
administrative tasks. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the officers had to return to stations in San Pedro and Watts. 
</P>
<P>
Although no new officers will be added to Harbor Gateway patrols, officials 
said the substation should allow current patrols to spend more time in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"It should provide incentive to keep the officers in the Gateway," said Niki 
Tennant, Harbor Gateway deputy to Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who proposed 
the substation. "It is a very convenient place for the officers to drop in." 
</P>
<P>
The substation, which is not open to the public, is on the ground floor of a 
12-story office building at 879 W. 190th St., near the junction of the Harbor 
(110) and San Diego (405) freeways.

PLANNING COMMISSION DELAYS VOTE ON SUNSHINE LANDFILL FOR 2 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Regional Planning Commission on Wednesday delayed a vote on the 
proposed Sunshine Canyon landfill expansion for two months after instructing 
the county staff to develop stricter conditions for its operation. 
</P>
<P>
The commission asked the staff to prepare alternate regulations for the 
landfill near Granada Hills after Commissioner Lee Strong complained that "the 
conditions don't go far enough." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest change that Strong proposed was to only grant the landfill owner, 
Browning-Ferris Industries, permission to dump 17 million tons of trash there 
before the company would have to once again seek county approval to continue 
operating. The county staff had recommended that the company be allowed to dump 
70 million tons there. 
</P>
<P>
Strong said the company might be a better neighbor if it knew its investment 
could be jeopardized by violating operating rules. 
</P>
<P>
The waste disposal firm wants to expand its 230-acre dump into an additional 
542 acres of unincorporated county land. The firm contends that the landfill 
must be enlarged to cope with the region's garbage crisis, but neighbors 
complain that an expansion would destroy thousands of trees and extend the life 
of what is already an environmental nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
Both Browning-Ferris and the landfill's opponents appeared to leave the meeting 
Wednesday half-satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Funk, an attorney for Browning-Ferris, said he was pleased because the 
commission appeared to favor the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the tenor of the discussion is how to get this done," Funk said. 
</P>
<P>
But Funk warned that the company might have to reconsider its proposal to 
donate 524 acres adjacent to the expansion site for parkland if the life of its 
operating permit is shortened. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said they were happy that the final decision was postponed. But they 
agreed with Funk's assessment that it appeared the commission was on the verge 
of approving the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of like an execution," said Mary Edwards, secretary of the North 
Valley Coalition, a homeowner group that has fought the landfill's expansion. 
"You are glad it's postponed, but you'd be happy if it wouldn't happen at all." 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Edwards and about two dozen other activists wore white gags 
in their mouths to protest the county's refusal to allow them to comment on 
Browning-Ferris' revised environmental impact report. Since February when the 
planning commission closed public debate on the project, Browning-Ferris has 
added two thick volumes to the report. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's meeting, Strong also proposed limiting the volume of trash 
dumped daily in the proposed expansion area to 6,000 tons rather than 8,000 
tons. He also said he wanted the company to pay the county 10% rather than 5% 
of the per-ton fee it will charge its customers. And he suggested that 
Browning-Ferris post a large bond to ensure that litter and rodent problems are 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
"The record hasn't been too great on that," said Strong, commenting on 
Browning-Ferris' performance at the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners said they would compare the original set of conditions and the 
revisions on Sept. 27 and then decide whether to choose one set or to combine 
them. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors will ultimately decide 
whether the landfill should be enlarged.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOTEL ORDINANCE AIMS AT PROSTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Gardena City Council has passed a zoning ordinance requiring that new 
hotels in the city be built on lots of at least one acre, with a minimum of 100 
feet of frontage and 150 feet of depth. The ordinance is intended to prevent 
the construction of small motels that cater to prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
A moratorium on motel construction that dates back to September, 1988, will 
automatically end when the new ordinance takes effect 30 days after passage. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena has 21 hotels and motels but lacks a large hotel with a banquet room, 
City Planner Roy Kato said. The city hopes to attract a developer wanting to 
build a substantial hotel that will include a restaurant, a banquet room and 
shops, he said.

REFLECTIONS: SHE'S NEVER LET HER FEET DRAG 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mamie Wurzel likes exotic animals. She once had an anteater in her Studio City 
home and took it shopping. She also enjoys volunteer work, but the favorite 
part of her day is the evening, when she goes dancing. Wurzel, 67, and her 
husband Max live in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
I was a tomboy. I was out in the streets playing all the time. My mother had a 
candy store, so there was always a bunch of kids around. I had three brothers 
and I played on the playgrounds until I was 17 years old with all the boys -- 
baseball, football, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
People who knew me when I was 2 or 3 years old and then met me when I was grown 
up were surprised I was still alive, because of the things I used to do, the 
climbing I did. I don't remember, but my mother said that when I was 2 years 
old I climbed on top of the house. I was just very, very active. I could do 
anything a boy could do. 
</P>
<P>
My older brother taught me how to fight. He was very athletic and we used to 
trade punches through a pillow to see who could make black-and-blue marks. 
</P>
<P>
When I started dating, none of the fellas would ever mess with me because I 
could beat them all up. 
</P>
<P>
I worked as a waitress from '41 until about nine years ago. When I quit as a 
waitress, I was used to getting up at 4 in the morning, I was going buggy. So I 
went down to the Jewish Home for the Aging on Victory Boulevard and I started 
to help down there. My mother was in the home there and I was helping with the 
crafts almost every day. 
</P>
<P>
Then they opened up the Vanguard Thrift Store on Reseda and Sherman Way and I 
went to work there. I get down there around 6 o'clock in the morning, so I get 
a lot of work done before anybody else gets in the place. Then I go home around 
noon, which is great for me because that gives me time to get ready to go out 
at night. I'm going out five nights a week, dancing. 
</P>
<P>
When I was a kid, my next-door neighbor, who happened to be black, taught me 
how to dance. I was out of school because I had hurt my ankle, and he taught me 
how to jitterbug on the corner, on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
From then on I was dancing whenever I could. I danced at the Palladium 
throughout the war years. We lived in Hollywood at the time. My girlfriend 
would come over and stay at my house and Sundays we'd go to the beach, play 
ball and go to the dances at night, the swing-shift dances after midnight. 
During the war they had those at Casino Gardens in Santa Monica. Tommy Dorsey's 
band used to play down there, you know, the big bands. 
</P>
<P>
My husband does not dance. He doesn't know his left from his right foot. So I 
have a partner who is in his 70s, a very good dancer. I learned an awful lot 
from my partner. The more I danced with him, the better I got. I've been 
dancing with him about six years. He's the one who taught me all this Latin. I 
was primarily a swing dancer because that's what I grew up with. 
</P>
<P>
I can do all your Latins: cha-chas, rumbas, tangos, mamba, salsa. I can even do 
the lambada if I have to, but I hate it. I waltz, I do West Coast swing and 
East Coast swing. I'm into West Coast swing now. It's a form of jitterbugging. 
</P>
<P>
I dance five nights a week for two to three hours until my partner gets tired 
and then we go. It's a real good workout. I don't know what I would do without 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is it exercise, it is socializing. I don't care where you go to, in 
the Valley, Long Beach, you are going to see people you know. You can say hello 
and start talking to them. Dancers are from all walks of life, all religions, 
all nationalities. You'd be surprised at how many people in their 70s and 80s 
are dancers, and there are a lot of young people doing ballroom dancing. 
</P>
<P>
When my partner can't dance anymore, I hope I can find another partner as good, 
but I will dance. I'm going to dance until I can't dance anymore, I hope 
forever. My dad died on a dance floor.

HARBOR PARK LAKE REOPENED AS 'TOXIN' PROVES TO BE ALGAE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city recreation officials reopened Machado Lake at Harbor Regional 
Park on Wednesday, one week after a heavy film of algae was mistakenly believed 
to be latex paint or a similarly toxic substance. 
</P>
<P>
"We're relieved," Jean Thaxton of the city Recreation and Parks Department said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The lake at the 230-acre park was closed July 18 after maintenance crews 
reported a heavy film that fire and health officials feared was a toxic 
material. That fear continued even after preliminary testing of the lake found 
that the water did not contain detectable levels of metals. 
</P>
<P>
After subsequent testing, Los Angeles County health officials determined that 
the water was not hazardous because it contained living microorganisms. "Our 
conclusion is that it is algae . . . and I am convinced it is not hazardous," 
said Samir Ibrahim, a hazardous materials specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Officials blamed the algae bloom on the recent hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the finding, city and county officials said they are not red-faced over 
closing the lake. "It was something we had to do," Thaxton said. "We would 
rather be safe and protect the community than just assume the lake wasn't 
hazardous."

BLASTS AT FROZEN FOOD COMPANY INJURE 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three electrical workers suffered third-degree burns and two Department of 
Water and Power employees suffered minor injuries in two explosions at a 
Chatsworth frozen food company Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The first explosion at Chef America, 9601 Canoga Ave., occurred as electrical 
workers attempted to replace a breaker on the main electrical panel, said 
company spokesman Paul Meraj. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody dropped the main panel on some high-voltage wires," Meraj said. 
"There was a flash, and they were burned." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Schaffer, 60, suffered second- and third-degree burns and was listed in 
critical condition at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital, a hospital spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Medrano, 38, and Evaristo Talavero, 19, were listed in serious condition 
at Northridge Hospital Medical Center with second- and third-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
Meraj said the private contractors were in the electrical room when the 
accident occurred at 10:10 a.m. The 480-volt main panel distributes electricity 
through the plant from a DWP industrial power station. 
</P>
<P>
The second explosion, a "flashover," occurred shortly after 2 p.m. when DWP 
workers attempted to restore power in the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in the process of re-energizing the customer's equipment," said DWP 
spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen. "Apparently there was still a problem with the 
transformer involved in the first accident." 
</P>
<P>
DWP worker Donald Wells, 50, suffered first- and second-degree burns to his 
face and was treated and released from Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
Walter Scoby, 51, suffered first- and second-degree burns to his face and neck. 
He was treated and released from that hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A DWP official said the accident did not cut off power to nearby customers. DWP 
employees were investigating.

LOS ANGELES SCHOOL BOARD BUYS OUT BRITTON'S CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I see that the Los Angeles Unified School District Board has done it again. It 
never ceases to amaze me how totally ignorant the board can be in terms of 
spending the taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
Without reflecting on the person of William Anton, who I am sure is competent, 
I can only say that the manner in which his surprise selection took place 
reflects once again the arrogance of the school board (Part A, July 17). 
</P>
<P>
Not only have they "bought out the contract" and dismissed Dr. Leonard Britton 
who had one more year on his contact, but they moved in secret to appoint a 
superintendent from within the system, a system that has a rather poor image in 
the city, state and nation. This underhanded way of appointment is to be 
condemned as blatantly arrogant, undemocratic, and an open denial of an open 
search process to select a new superintendent that would have brought input 
from outside the insulated and isolated school board. What makes this exercise 
even more scandalous is the fact that they bought out Britton's contract for 
more than $225,000 at a time that they profess to have a school-wide deficit of 
more than $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
While the board is willing to pay this unnecessary expenditure, where will the 
board now make up the difference in an already deficit-plagued budget? It is 
time for the state and the public to realize the necessity for breaking up this 
large, unmanageable and undemocratic school district so that there is more 
accountability. I can well understand the general public's emerging political 
skepticism with incumbents and welcome the voters' mood to vote out all 
incumbents. Certainly newly elected neophytes couldn't do any worse than the 
current crop of school board members.

SHORING UP THE COASTLINE; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSED LEGISLATION WOULD MAKE VIOLATIONS A CRIMINAL ACT AND IMPOSE STIFF 
FINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the law, Californians need permission to dump trash into a marsh or 
scrape the top off a ridgeline overlooking the Pacific to make a flat place for 
a house. But these, and other, violations of the California Coastal Act happen 
all the time, and small wonder. The state Coastal Commission has only one 
full-time enforcement officer, and all that she can do to stop a diligent 
violator is line up in the state's crowded court system. 
</P>
<P>
A bill to change this has passed the state Senate and is working its way 
through the Assembly. The new enforcement powers and higher fines it provides 
are crucial to prevent further irreparable damage to the coastline. The 
Assembly should rush the bill to Gov. George Deukmejian, who should reconsider 
his position on coastal protection and sign it. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Sens. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) and Ed Davis 
(R-Valencia), the bill gives the commission's executive director authority to 
order violators to cease and desist. This way damage will not pile up while the 
commission waits for a judge. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowing an idea already in force in Santa Barbara, the bill would create a 
system in which enforcement of the coastal law would pay most of its own way. 
The state commission, or local agencies that enforce the law in their own 
areas, would bill a violator for what it costs to handle his case. This is 
important because one reason the commission is down to a single enforcement 
officer is that the governor systematically cut its budget during much of the 
1980s. The new approach to the costs of enforcement would protect the 
commission as well as the coast. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, willful violation of the law would be a criminal act, 
punishable by fines as steep as $10,000 for each day the violation continued 
and up to a year in jail. Civil fines would increase as well, and the 
commission itself could impose fines without going through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
About five violations are reported every day, either by local officials or 
people who stumble across such things as canyons being turned into landfills by 
the light of the moon. Nancy Cave, head of enforcement for the commission, 
thinks that twice as many violations go unreported. One thing they do know: Of 
the reported cases, half are in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Our coast is one of the wonders of the world. Trying to protect it with a law 
that can't be enforced could be worse than no protection, because it creates 
the impression that everything is all right. The Rosenthal-Davis bill will 
help.

SLAIN MAN WAS SUSPECTED DRUG DEALER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man shot to death this week while sitting in his customized Mercedes-Benz was 
a suspected drug dealer who was killed shortly after a court hearing in Van 
Nuys, where he was facing charges of arson in connection with a string of car 
fires, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert R. Hagen, 25, of Woodland Hills was shot to death at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday 
while sitting in his parked car on Calvert Street, about two blocks from the 
courthouse. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
Hagen was killed less than an hour after a Superior Court hearing at which his 
attorney asked a judge to dismiss four counts of arson. Los Angeles police 
declined Wednesday to comment on whether the arson case, which was held over 
until Aug. 1, or any other suspected criminal activity involving Hagen, is 
believed to have any connection to his slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gloria M. Mas said that Hagen was suspected of selling drugs 
and that the arson case involved allegations that Hagen intimidated and set 
fire to cars belonging to four people with whom he had disputes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he did anything legitimate," Mas said. "He was known to people 
in the community as a drug dealer. People were afraid of him." 
</P>
<P>
Hagen's attorney, James E. Blatt, declined to comment on how Hagen made a 
living. But Blatt, who said he represented Hagen in 10 cases since Hagen was 
15, said his client had never been arrested for drug dealing and had been 
planning to buy an auto repair shop. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed to be getting a handle on his life and was going into legitimate 
business," Blatt said. "We walked out of the courthouse together, and he was 
optimistic about his future. He gave no indication that he felt he was in 
danger." 
</P>
<P>
Blatt said that earlier this year, two charges of assault and one charge of 
possession of anabolic steroids against Hagen, a bodybuilder, were dismissed 
for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The arson case involved four separate incidents in 1989, in which people said 
their cars were damaged by fires after the people had become involved in 
disputes with Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
A Porter Ranch teen-ager testified at a preliminary hearing last year that his 
car was burned a day after he accepted a ride home with a woman who had 
previously dated Hagen. The youth testified that before his car was set on 
fire, he received a telephone call in which Hagen allegedly told him that he 
had made a mistake by riding with the woman. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a nut," the teen-ager testified that Hagen told him.

GARDENA TRASH RATES TO BE RAISED 34% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN M. ROSE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monthly trash collection rates in Gardena will rise from $7.27 per household to 
$9.75 under a contract amendment approved this week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The 34% rate increase results from a clause in the city's 1988 contract with 
Western Waste Industries that allows the Harbor Gateway company to increase 
rates based on rising costs, City Manager Kenneth Landau said. The company 
cited a 60% increase in dumping costs since 1988, a 20% increase in diesel fuel 
prices and a 7% increase in labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
The new residential trash rate is retroactive to July 1. In addition, a $1.50 
monthly fee will be charged starting in October to pay for a state-mandated 
recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody likes the increase, but it's a must," Councilman Mas Fukai said. 
According to the city's contract, the rate must be lower than the average fee 
charged in eight other cities in the South Bay area. Among those cities, 
monthly charges per housing unit range from a low of $6.95 in Lawndale to 
$11.90 in Carson, a city report said. 
</P>
<P>
No such proviso exists for the recycling fee, which varies widely in cities 
that have initiated such programs. All cities in the state must implement 
recycling in order to satisfy a state law that mandates a 25% reduction in 
trash delivered to landfills by 1995 and a 50% reduction by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
In Carson, for example, Western Waste has agreed to provide free curbside 
pickup for recyclable materials in return for a franchise to collect the city's 
commercial and industrial waste. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly recycling fee negotiated in Gardena, $1.50 for each single-family 
home or two- to four-unit townhouse, could be reduced by 50 cents if the city 
reduces its waste stream by 25%, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new contract, Western Waste will give each household two 14-gallon 
recycling containers, to be used for newspapers, glass bottles and jars, 
aluminum cans and other items. The company will also pay for a one-time 
collection of household hazardous waste and a state-ordered study of the kinds 
of waste produced in the city, officials said. The agreement allows the company 
to request another rate review starting Jan. 1.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'CHEERS' ACTOR FINISHES HIGHWAY CLEANUP DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Cheers" star Kelsey Grammer has completed a 10-day stint of picking up trash 
and pulling weeds along local highways as punishment for failing to attend a 
court-ordered alcohol abuse program. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer, 35, of Van Nuys, who plays Dr. Frasier Crane on the popular NBC 
television series, has spent two weeks in jail and must complete an alcohol 
education program by Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to jail and ordered to do the Caltrans work and take the 
alcohol course by Van Nuys Municipal Court Commissioner Patricia Gorner 
Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz said Grammer had violated probation because he did not attend the 
alcohol program ordered as a condition of probation for a 1987 drunk-driving 
arrest in Van Nuys, to which Grammer pleaded no contest. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer was sentenced to 30 days in jail but was released early because of jail 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
He is due back in Van Nuys Superior Court on Aug. 6 on a cocaine-possession 
charge. Grammer was ordered to stand trial on the charge after he failed to 
attend a court-ordered drug-abuse program stemming from a cocaine arrest.

The savings-and-loan disaster stretched over so many years and embraced so much 
thievery, chicanery and stupidity that observers can choose among many if-only 
moments when taking the other fork in the road would have saved the American 
taxpayer billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all the anger at those who walked away with the money and aren't even 
being prosecuted, people forget that the decision-makers who took the wrong 
fork and facilitated the thefts are still in positions of great prominence and 
power -- at the investment banking houses, in the universities, in law firms 
and accounting firms. And especially in Congress where, it now appears, the 
appearance of impropriety does not bar a member from serving on the committee 
that judges the behavior of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
One of those if-only moments was when Congress failed to pass the "FSLIC recap 
bill" in 1986. This was an effort by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the 
Treasury Department to find cash so the bankrupt Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corporation could pay off the depositors and close down S&amp;Ls run 
by crooks and greedy fools. The amount requested was $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The recap bill was supposed to be nonpartisan and noncontroversial because 
nobody had yet admitted that the taxpayers would have to put up the money (the 
bonds that would be issued to provide the $15 billion were in theory going to 
be funded by extra FSLIC insurance premiums paid by the S&amp;Ls themselves). 
The bill sailed through the House Banking Committee with only a single 
dissenting vote. Like other noncontroversial bills, it was placed on the 
"suspense" calendar in the House, meaning that the usual rules governing the 
passage of legislation would be suspended and no amendments could be offered. 
The Speaker at the time, Jim Wright (D-Tex.), took it off the calendar for a 
couple of weeks, but the bill eventually passed the House. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.) stopped action on it. In a letter to 
Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray, Pryor complained of "what appears to be a 
deliberate system of harrassment against many institutions," and repeated the 
standard canard that examiners who saw nothing wrong at an S&amp;L "were 
ordered to go back to the institution and stay 'until they find something.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I have put a 'hold' on the Senate recapitalization bill," Pryor wrote in the 
next-to-last paragraph of the three-page letter, "and am anxious to receive 
assurances from you that you will correct the abuses which have been taking 
place in Arkansas and other states. I was pleased to learn that you have been 
discussing this problem with the House majority leader and hope that we can 
receive some assurances from you and move ahead with this important piece of 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Though the numbers are smaller because the state is smaller, Arkansas had the 
absolutely worst record in the country in the percentage of its S&amp;Ls that 
went bad and the eminence of the individuals associated with them. A law firm 
including two past presidents of the Arkansas Bar Assn. paid out $12 million to 
the FSLIC to avoid a suit that would have put on record the details of how one 
of its name partners took loans from FirstSouth, the state's largest S&amp;L, 
for the purpose of buying bad assets to conceal them from examiners. When the 
examination was over, he returned the assets and FirstSouth canceled the loan. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Pryor wrote that the problems he conceded at the Arkansas 
S&amp;Ls derived mostly from "severely depressed areas which have suffered from 
losses in the oil and timber industries." But economic conditions were a small 
portion of the Arkansas problem. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, there had never been enough business in Arkansas to satisfy Pryor's 
constituents, who were growing like Jack's beanstalk with federally insured 
deposits from all over the country. Arkansas S&amp;Ls had bigger losses in 
Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma and California than they did at home. 
</P>
<P>
No one can say how much money taxpayers would have been saved if a clean FSLIC 
recapitalization bill had passed in 1986 (instead of the amendment-clogged bill 
that passed a year later), but the number is almost certainly in the tens of 
billions of dollars. Pryor's action certainly did more damage than the famous 
meeting the next spring to which Sen. Donald W. Riegle (D-Mich.) summoned Gray 
so that Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), Dennis DeConini (D-Ariz.), John Glenn 
(D-Ohio) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) could express their support for Charles 
Keating, owner of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan, in his wars with the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
But Pryor has not been accused of impropriety. Far from it. He is a member of 
the Senate Ethics Committee that will sit in judgment on the so-called Keating 
Five. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of Pryor's letter was put on the record only a couple of months 
ago, when H. Joe Selby, who had been director of supervision for the 9th 
Federal Home Loan Bank District (which includes Arkansas) testified about it 
during field hearings in Dallas by the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor says he had forgotten about the letter. When it surfaced, he took it to 
Sens. Howard T. Heflin (D-Ala.) and Warren Rudman (R-N.H.), the co-chairmen of 
the Senate Ethics Committee, and to its counsel Robert Bennett. He says they 
decided to put the letter "on the record." But the records of the Ethics 
Committee are secret. 
</P>
<P>
This issue, Pryor argues, is not like the Keating matter because "I interceded 
not on behalf of a specific case -- it was generic in nature. I didn't ask Mr. 
Gray to waive regulations -- I was concerned about a process." He did not write 
a blanket defense of the Arkansas S&amp;Ls. The letter conceded that "there are 
also institutions which have adopted a 'go-go' approach in their management and 
need to be reined in." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very very strong letter, but I was trying to get Mr. Gray's 
attention," Pryor said. "And two weeks after that letter was sent, the recap 
bill was passed." But not, of course, into law. A much-amended version of the 
bill passed by the Senate was killed when sent back to the House close to 
midnight on the last night of the 1986 session. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Pryor's complaints in his letter are similar to those the Keating Five 
brought on Keating's behalf. He and the co-chairmen of the Ethics Committee 
have decided that regardless of this episode, he can sit in judgment of his 
fellow senators. Others may feel that such disregard of apparent impropriety 
casts doubt on the Senate's self-respect.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WORKER AT AIR BASE CHARGED IN THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A civilian warehouse worker at Edwards Air Force Base was charged Wednesday 
with receiving stolen property after Air Force and sheriff's investigators 
raided his Lancaster home and found stolen military uniforms and supplies, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Flax, 38, was free on $5,000 bond after his arrest Tuesday when 
investigators from the sheriff's gang unit and the Air Force Office of Special 
Investigations served a search warrant at his home. 
</P>
<P>
They recovered camouflage fatigues, boots and first aid kits, according to 
Sheriff's Deputy Pat Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
No military weapons were recovered during the search, which also turned up a 
sawed-off shotgun and a small quantity of drugs, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe Flax was stealing materials from the warehouse and 
selling them, deputies said. Air Force officials refused to comment, saying the 
investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's gang unit was involved because Flax apparently had contact with 
gang members, Hunter said. Deputies are trying to determine whether gang 
members were involved in the theft or the sale of the military property, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Flax was charged with receiving stolen property, a felony, because it appears 
difficult to prove that he stole the materials, deputies said.

FRANK JARES SR.; RETIRED PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Jares Sr., a professional wrestler known as "Brother Frank" during early 
television's wrestling heyday, has died in Valencia. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
Jares, who started out as an amateur wrestler and weightlifter, played a 
villain in the professional wrestling ring from 1945 until his retirement in 
1959. 
</P>
<P>
He died Tuesday of complications related to pneumonia, said his son Joe Jares 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Born Oct. 6, 1912, in Pittsburgh, Pa., Jares came to California as a teen-ager. 
At 14, his parents were killed in an auto accident, and he dropped out of high 
school and started driving a truck for a living. 
</P>
<P>
He began wrestling and lifting weights at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. He 
became the Pacific Coast amateur wrestling champion and, in 1932, was nearly 
placed on the U. S. Olympic weightlifting team as a lightweight-heavyweight. 
During the 1930s and '40s, he worked out at Santa Monica's legendary Muscle 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Jares left weightlifting in 1941 and went into professional wrestling, 
appearing as Brother Frank, the Mormon Mauler from Provo, Utah, and the Thing, 
a villain with a bright orange beard and hair. (For this character, he toted a 
black box that emitted a hissing rattlesnake sound when he pushed a button.) 
</P>
<P>
"One woman wrote to me that she got so mad watching me wrestle on TV that she 
threw a shoe at the set and broke the tube," Jares once said. "She said that if 
I was really a decent type, I would help her fix it." 
</P>
<P>
Jares, who lost the sight in his right eye in an accidental finger-gouging 
during an amateur match, always said the greatest danger in the sport was not 
the opponents but the fans. One time, a ring-sider gave him a swipe across the 
forehead, causing a cut that took 13 stitches to close. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was good publicity. People jammed the place to see me fight with a 
bandage on my forehead," he said of the episode. 
</P>
<P>
After he left the professional wrestling circuit, Jares went to work as a 
butcher for a packinghouse in San Fernando. A knee injury a few years later 
forced him to quit. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, he moved to Valencia and was a regular at the Santa Clarita 
Valley Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife of 53 years, Dorothy Jares 
of Valencia; son Frank Jares Jr. of Newhall; two sisters, Sophia Diehl of 
Eugene, Ore., and Helen Vetterly of Pittsburgh; six granddaughters and one 
great-grandson. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service is scheduled for 3 p.m. today at Eternal Valley Memorial 
Park, 23287 N. Sierra Highway, Newhall, which is handling the arrangements. 
Donations can be made in Jares' name to the Santa Clarita Valley Senior Center, 
22900 Market St., Newhall 91321.

POLICE SAY THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO CATCH PHONY RANSOM CALLER; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATIONS: THREATS APPARENTLY ARE RANDOM AND NEVER MADE TO THE SAME WOMAN 
TWICE. LAW OFFICIALS AND PHONE COMPANY LACK THE TECHNOLOGY TO STOP THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Unless the man who has been harassing San Gabriel Valley women with threatening 
telephone calls changes his method of operation or reveals his crimes to an 
acquaintance, police say there is little chance of catching him. 
</P>
<P>
Since April, more than 50 women from Pasadena to West Covina have been called 
by the man, who says he is holding the woman's husband hostage at gunpoint and 
demands ransom money for his release. The caller, who has an East Coast accent, 
also insists that victims call him "sir," and frequently asks the women 
sexually explicit questions. 
</P>
<P>
No husband has actually been held hostage, and police said no one has paid the 
caller any ransom money. In most cases, the women called their husbands to make 
sure they were safe before contacting police. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from 10 San Gabriel Valley law enforcement agencies are investigating 
the calls, which have increased in frequency during the last month. But because 
the man picks his victims seemingly at random and has never called the same 
woman twice, investigators say he is virtually unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
"He could probably get away with this forever," Monrovia Police Sgt. Ron Buck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In investigating obscene or harassing telephone calls, Buck said, the standard 
approach is for police to set an electronic "trap" on the victim's telephone 
line. Once installed by the telephone company, the trap traces all incoming 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
Although one recent victim had a trap installed, the man has not called back, 
Buck said. 
</P>
<P>
In some states, telephone companies offer customers a caller-identification 
service. This allows people to see the telephone numbers of calls coming into 
their homes or businesses and has led to dramatic drops in reports of obscene 
and harassing phone calls, Pac Bell spokeswoman Kathleen Flynn said. Similar 
service will be available in California in mid-1991, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Police Detective Dennis Edwards said such a system would make 
investigating this case easier. "It would help immensely, and I'm sure it'd cut 
down on the number of annoying phone calls that would occur" in general, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Without benefit of an incriminating telephone number, investigators have looked 
for a pattern to the calls in hopes of uncovering a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Tom More of the sheriff's Temple City substation said that data has been 
informally exchanged between the 10 law enforcement agencies investigating the 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
By pooling data, authorities found that the caller picks couples listed jointly 
in the phone book, and he calls the home on weekday mornings after the husband 
would presumably have left for work. But that has not led authorities any 
closer to a suspect, More said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they are looking for suspects among people with histories of 
making obscene or harassing calls. Although this approach has supplied a number 
of names, the law does not permit authorities to request phone bills or take 
other action without evidence that would make someone a clear suspect in the 
case, Pasadena Police Sgt. Monte Yancey said. 
</P>
<P>
"So we proved that (a hypothetical suspect) was in Culver City at the same time 
someone in Culver City was called. Then we're supposed to prove beyond a shadow 
of a doubt that he did it? It's not going to happen," Yancey said. 
</P>
<P>
Yancey and other law enforcement officials said the best chance of catching the 
caller is a tip from the public. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no amount of (police) manpower in the world that can help you in a 
case like this," Yancey said. 
</P>
<P>
But as the crimes are publicized, he said that someone to whom the caller may 
have revealed his actions may come forward. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Phil Bullington, who is working with More on the case, agreed 
that publicity may help ferret out the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
"As they get a lot of publicity, they can't help telling somebody, 'Hey, that's 
me,' " Bullington said of many criminals. "That is something that gets a lot of 
people caught."

Digital Equipment Corp.: The Maynard, Mass.-based computer maker reported a 
loss of $256.7 million in its fourth quarter, contrasted with a profit of 
$313.2 million in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
The loss came on operating revenue of $3.4 billion, down 4%. For the fiscal 
year ended June 30, after pretax charges of $550 million, net income totaled 
$74.4 million, contrasted with $1.1 billion in the 1989 fiscal year. Total 
operating revenue was up 2% to $12.9 billion. The company said its first 
quarterly loss was mainly attributable to the $400-million cost of its 
restructuring program. About 3,000 employees have left the firm under a 
voluntary severance program implemented as part of that restructuring. The 
company also cited "the continuing economic slowdown" that is affecting U.S. 
and other markets.

AST Research Inc.: The Irvine-based computer company said it had net income of 
$35.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, contrasted with a net loss of 
$7.5 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue was $533.8 million, up 17%. The company's fourth quarter was especially 
strong; net income totaled $15.2 million, compared to $2.5 million for the 
year-ago quarter. AST said its stronger showing was in part because of 
increased sales of its higher margin Premium 386 and i486 personal computer 
products.

Bethlehem Steel Corp.: The Bethlehem, Pa., steel producer said second-quarter 
net income fell 73% to $22 million, while revenue dipped 11% to $1.275 billion. 
The firm said the decline in net income was because of lower steel shipments 
and prices, and higher operating costs.

Nations Act to Spur Trade Talks: The United States, the European Community and 
other major trading nations drafted a negotiating timetable aimed at rescuing 
the stalled Uruguay Round trade liberalization talks. At the same time, the 
European Community publicly reaffirmed its commitment to successfully 
concluding the four-year talks, scheduled to end in December. The draft 
program, they said, included several key dates: on Sept. 30, there will be a 
presentation of detailed national agricultural support and export subsidy 
schemes and possible reductions; on Oct. 8, high government officials will go 
to Geneva to meet "on a more or less permament basis" to reinforce their 
lower-ranking permanent negotiating teams.; on Oct. 15, governments are 
scheduled to make presentations on improved market access offers; on Nov. 15, a 
draft package covering all 15 Uruguay Round sectors will be submitted to 
participants by Dunkel; on Dec. 4, trade ministers will meet in Brussels to try 
and complete a full agreement.

</P>
<P>
Revenue increased 10.3% to $519.1 million. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based firm

HOME IMPROVEMENTS OFTEN DO NOT RAISE RESALE VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Margaret Maxwell and her husband, John, spent thousands of dollars to 
install a unique pool in their back yard in El Cajon, they did it in hopes that 
at least some of their investment might someday end up back in their pockets. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that any time you do something to your house, you do it with the hope 
that it will improve the value of the house," Margaret Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
But home experts caution that not all home improvements are good investments, 
and in some cases they can even lower the market value of a house. 
</P>
<P>
Pools and spas, which generally are worth about half of their cost when a home 
is resold, are two improvements that commonly disappoint homeowners when 
brokers tell them how much they are worth to prospective buyers, said Joe 
Garcanelli, a realtor and co-owner of Century 21 All Service in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody spends money on a house, they expect to get their money back," 
he said. "They will add a family room or a pool, and they will invest more than 
they will ever get back. . . . They're disappointed; I understand that. But I 
have to tell them what the market value is." 
</P>
<P>
Although high quality improvments done by homeowners often can result in a 
profit when a home is sold, the most homeowners can expect from a typical job 
done by a building contractor is usually a dollar-for-dollar return on their 
investment, Garcanelli said. The high cost of labor paid by homeowners to 
contractors is usually difficult to recoup in a home sale. 
</P>
<P>
The best investments homeowners can make are kitchen and bathroom remodeling, 
roof repairs, landscaping and lighting improvements, Garcanelli said. 
</P>
<P>
The key to getting good resale return on improvements is to use styles and 
colors that are appealing to mainstream homeowners, Garcanelli said. Homeowners 
are almost sure to be disappointed by the impact on the value of their homes if 
they do landscaping or decorating to satisfy highly individualistic tastes, he 
said. In extreme cases, unconventional changes can decrease the value of a 
home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Myers, owner of a San Diego appraisal firm, said one of his customers in 
Santee spent more than $20,000 to add a poorly designed master bedroom and 
bathroom that could only be reached by a stairwell on the outside of the home. 
Myers said the man was "shocked" last year when he decided to sell the home and 
was told by Myers that the work added nothing to the value of his home, and may 
have even hurt his chances of selling it. 
</P>
<P>
"Real poor room designs are typically the worst things we see," Myers said. 
"They stick a box-type structure on the roof of the garage and they say, 
'that's the master bedroom.' " 
</P>
<P>
Myers called such ill-planned additions "the kiss of death" for people trying 
to sell a home, and said homeowners should spend the extra money to consult 
contractors or appraisers before they jump into major projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Cost does not equal value," he said. "If you're going to do it, spend a little 
extra money and get it done right." 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie McLaughlin, president of the San Diego Assn. of Realtors, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain things that are so personal, like decorating, that they can 
be disappointments when it comes time to sell," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the surest ways to make the value of a home drop is to add living space 
that does not fit well with the floor plan of the house, such as a room that 
must be entered through another room, Garcanelli said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Garcanelli and McLaughlin, Myers also emphasized that excessive personal 
creativity can make a home difficult to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes that's all it takes to turn a buyer off, and you have just lost a 
sale," he said. "At least people can live with neutral colors, and personalize 
it as they wish." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Prazen, who recently had about $15,000 of patio work and landscaping done 
at his El Cajon home, said he consulted a realtor to learn what types of 
improvements would make good investments. He said that, although he enjoys the 
improvements, resale value was critical in his decision to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
Prazen said that, although he has no plans to move soon, he wanted to consider 
the effect of the changes on the overall value of his home because "you never 
know" when a move might be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be well worth it," he said. "I think I can get all the money I put 
into it back." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Lewis, owner of Jack Lewis Realty in Coronado, said pools -- the most 
common source of disappointment to optimistic homeowners -- are a hit-and-miss 
gamble for those seeking a big return on their investment. Some buyers are 
looking for homes with pools, but just as many consider them a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people just don't want them," he said. "They have kids running 
around, and pools are not cheap to maintain." 
</P>
<P>
Myers, owner of the appraisal firm, said the investment value of a pool is 
partly dependent on the value of the house it is being added to. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the price range," he said. "In the million-dollar plus range, 
pools are almost a necessity." 
</P>
<P>
However, in homes worth less than $200,000, the value of pools drops 
dramatically, he said. Home-buyers looking in that price range are often 
first-time buyers looking for "basic shelter," and they often see pools as 
nothing but an "expense and a worry."

HOMEFED: SAME ROAD AS GREAT AMERICAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Could HomeFed Bank be headed down the same slow road to disaster that its long 
time San Diego rival, Great American Bank, embarked on a couple of years ago, a 
slide that culminated earlier this month with Great American's agreement to 
sell its California branches to Wells Fargo? 
</P>
<P>
The question is on the minds of many San Diegans in the aftermath of Homefed's 
announcement last week that it lost $108 million in the second quarter after 
setting aside a record $234 million in reserves for probable loan and 
foreclosure sale losses. 
</P>
<P>
Comparisons of the two thrifts are nothing new. Homefed and Great American were 
always measured against one another as they rose to prominence as two of the 
most successful and influential thrifts in the industry. For 20 years, they 
competed fiercely for depositors and branch locations and tried to outdo one 
another in community and philanthropic activities to gain local prestige. 
</P>
<P>
Homefed's second-quarter loss invites continued comparison with Great American, 
particularly because its loss was largely due to its out-of-state loan 
portfolio, the same bugaboo that has brought Great American to the verge of 
insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point in Great American's fortunes could be traced to an innocuous 
disclosure in its July, 1988, earnings statement that assets acquired through 
its 1986 merger with an Arizona thrift were "under (regulatory) review to 
assess reserve adequacy." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next seven quarters, Great American would set aside loss reserves 
totaling $525 million -- the bulk of them attributable to bad Arizona loans -- 
that led to huge net losses, shrunken capital, the threat of a government 
takeover and eventually the branch sale agreement with Wells Fargo. The 
downsizing of Great American that will result is also likely to cause hundreds 
of layoffs of Great American's headquarters staff. 
</P>
<P>
And now Homefed has an out-of state loan problem of its own. 
</P>
<P>
A startling 12.7% or $447 million of Homefed's $3.5 billion total out-of-state 
assets are "non-performing," meaning on non-accrual or in foreclosure. That 
contrasts with a 2.1% ratio of non-performers to total loans and real estate 
owned in California. The picture is particularly grim in Florida, where $173 
million or 29% of Homefed loans are either not earning interest or in 
foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Of the S&amp;L's $708-million total nonperforming assets -- an alarming 3.73% 
of total assets -- more than 60% result from loans that were made outside the 
state, Homefed said, while out-of-state loans account for only 20% of Homefed's 
total assets. 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder that Homefed simultaneously announced last week that it will no 
longer make out-of state loans except in Nevada. Homefed also announced that it 
will ease out of commercial real estate lending, a response to the grim 
statistic that $200 million, or 9% of Homefed's $2.2 billion in commercial 
loans are delinquent. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week, HomeFed President Robert F. Adelizzi argued 
strenuously that Homefed is not comparable to Great American. His S&amp;L has a 
"much stronger capital position" than Great American had two years ago when its 
Arizona loans began to unravel. That stronger capital position leaves Homefed 
in better condition to deal with problems in the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A comparison of the two thrifts' balance sheets supports Adelizzi. Despite 
Homefed's $108-million second-quarter loss, the S&amp;L's tangible capital as 
of June 30 was still $805 million, a healthy 4.2% of its $19 billion in total 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Great American's tangible capital at its June 30, 1988, "turning 
point" was $387.7 million or only 2.5% of its $15.7 billion in assets, which in 
retrospect was a thin safety cushion indeed for the problems that lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gordon, a thrift industry analyst with PaineWebber in New York said 
Homefed "has far more capital that Great American ever had at its peak, even 
after the meaningful write-downs (Homefed) has taken." 
</P>
<P>
"Although Homefed does have a lot of exposure to risky real estate, that real 
estate is in what is today healthy economies -- -- Florida; Washington, D.C., 
and California," Gordon said. "If you look at Homefed's exposure in 
economically weak areas, it's minimal. 
</P>
<P>
"Great American unfortunately bought (into) Arizona which was a lot of their 
assets and one of worst markets in the country," Gordon said. "For this to 
really be deja vu, we would really need the real estate market in Florida and 
California to look like it does in Arizona -- -- not a pretty thought." 
</P>
<P>
Adelizzi agreed that the California economy and the continuing strength in the 
housing market hold the keys to Homefed's future. And he insists that the 
outlook in population and job formation is strong, despite the specter of 
defense layoffs which some pessimists say will bring to California the real 
estate deflation seen in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Spady, a thrift industry analyst with Morgan Stanley investment firm in 
New York, praised Homefed for being forthright in dealing with the bad 
out-of-state loans by taking large reserves and deciding to shut down most 
non-California loan operations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way (Homefed and Great American) are comparable at this early 
date," Spady said, adding that Homefed's large second-quarter loan loss 
provision was strong medicine that may prevent it from having to set aside a 
succession of big loss provisions over future quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Sal Serrantino, president of California Research Corp., a Santa Monica-based 
S&amp;L consulting firm, said Homefed has hit a "few bumps along the road, but 
their strong capital position has held them in strong stead." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see them going down the path of Great American. (Homefed management) 
is too smart and more flexible than Great American's was in the sense of (Great 
American) going down the course in Arizona whatever happens," Serrantino said. 
</P>
<P>
"Homefed on the other hand quickly cut its losses, said they would not make any 
more loans in the market and would move back to safe harbor," Serrantino said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, most industry observers long ago lost whatever illusions they may 
have had that any S&amp;L is immune to life-threatening problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know. It's unanalyzable," Spady said when asked if Homefed's loan 
problems were behind it. "We are talking about something that's very difficult 
to figure out the depths of. It's hard to say ahead of time how bad things can 
get when it comes to credit quality because (analysts) can't look at every 
single loan." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly concerned about Homefed's future are its shareholders, who have 
seen the S&amp;L's stock price drop sharply in recent weeks. On Wednesday, the 
shares closed down $.25 at $13.50. As recently as June 25, Homefed shares 
closed at $21.875. Last October, Homefed shares sold for $47.50.

ROHR SIGNS 2ND $1-BILLION CONTRACT FOR ENGINE CASINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time this year, Rohr Industries has signed a $1-billion 
follow-on contract to supply casings for jet engines for commercial airliners, 
the Chula Vista-based firm announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of Rohr said they reached an agreement with European manufacturer 
Airbus Industrie to furnish the aerodynamic structures -- known as nacelles -- 
for 800 aircraft. However, the contract will not immediately boost jobs, a Rohr 
spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, Rohr will design and manufacture nacelle 
systems for the CFM56-5A engines that power Airbus A320 airliners and CFM56-5B 
engine for the Airbus A321. 
</P>
<P>
With the new contract, Rohr will provide nacelle systems for 1,000 Airbus craft 
in all, five times more than the 200 planes originally specified under a 1984 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Rohr signed a $1-billion follow-on contact with International Aero 
Engines to provide nacelle systems for McDonnell Douglas MD-90 jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
Airbus is a consortium owned by Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Airbus of West 
Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain. 
The IAE consortium includes Pratt &amp; Whitney of the United States, England's 
Rolls-Royce and a group of Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
Rohr officials said the close working relationship between their European 
program team and the two European manufacturing consortiums was the key to both 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
"This program demonstrates the benefits of bringing together the capabilities 
of the international aerospace community. This Europe-oriented program 
continues to be successful and mutually beneficial for us and our customers," 
said Don Purdy, vice president of commercial business. 
</P>
<P>
After reporting its first $1-billion sales year in fiscal 1989, Rohr surprised 
industry observers by announcing an $11.4-million first-quarter loss in 
October. The company blamed more stringent standards in military programs, 
which at the time accounted for 25% of Rohr's business. 
</P>
<P>
However, the company has continued to benefit from an unprecedented worldwide 
demand for commercial aircraft. Spokesman Roger Renstrom said Rohr's firm order 
backlog now stands at $2.6 billion, and the expected backlog represents another 
$2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"Our projections are that the high demand will continue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rohr employs 11,400 workers at 10 facilities in the United States and one in 
Europe. The company reported $759 million in sales for the first three quarters 
of fiscal 1990.

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: ESTROGEN AND CANCER

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Everything I read these days seems to indicate that women can take 
estrogen without increasing their risk of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Yet I'm positive that, some years ago, estrogen was considered to increase the 
risk of breast cancer. Am I wrong about what I think I remember, or has the 
thinking changed in the past several years? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There is some evidence that, at one time, women who were treated with 
estrogen did have a higher incidence of breast cancer than is true of women 
being treated with estrogen today. The reason seems to be that higher doses of 
the hormone were prescribed in the 1940s than is the case today.

DANCING AROUND A CONCERT PROBLEM

Lo-Tec concerts can make for strange bedfellows. This weekend at Three's 
Company's Hillcrest studio is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
Improvisation Inc. was scheduled to share the program with San Diego-based 
Pamela Turner at 8:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday evening. Pairing Turner's 
powerful dance drama with some improvised kinetics imported from Santa Barbara 
was not exactly a marriage made in heaven. But it was a practical solution for 
Lo-Tec organizer, Jean Isaacs, who hoped to flesh out the evening's 
entertainment by adding Turner's 45-minute piece (which played to sold-out 
houses at Sushi last year) with another work. 
</P>
<P>
The improv troupe said it didn't have enough dancers and pulled out of the 
commitment earlier this month, leaving the Lo-Tec series holding the bag. 
Fortunately, Three's Company's resident choreographers and a few of its company 
dancers came to the rescue with a mini-concert to balance Turner's portion of 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's surprise appearance comes as a windfall for Three's Company fans 
because the troupe was not scheduled for any Lo-Tec appearances this summer. In 
fact, the city's leading modern dance troupe had no plans to dance on home turf 
until next January. 
</P>
<P>
The most exciting contribution from the Three's Company camp promises to be 
Isaacs' "Red Dress, White Dress," which features a pair of solos never 
performed in San Diego. Featuring Terry Wilson and Faith Jensen-Ismay, the 
dance made its debut during the troupe's recent 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland tour, and Isaacs believes it reflects her foreign experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased it worked out this way," she said in a break from rehearsals, 
"because we want to show what we're doing. I choreographed the piece in Europe 
to the German expressionist music of Kurt Weill, and it's very affected by my 
being in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
A reprise of Nancy McCaleb's twosome, "Aelia Laelia Crispis," with Kim Chidley 
and Denise Dabrowski doing the dancing, is also on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to the two offerings by Three's Company, the flip side of the 
concert -- Turner's "Choices" -- pits a pair of actors (Rick Meads and Veronica 
Murphy-Smith) against dancers Tonnie Haig and Greg Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the challenge I put before myself," said Turner. The San Diego dance 
maker moves freely between the world of theater (she's resident choreographer 
for the Lamb's Players) and concert dance. This work combines the two sides of 
her dance persona. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it intriguing to mix the two mediums and somehow get a cohesive blend 
that doesn't make either one incomplete. I enjoy working with actors and 
dancers They surprise me." 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, Turner's theater designs for "The Wind in the Willows" will be 
playing concurrently at the Lamb's National City playhouse, while Turner's 
modern dance drama plays out in the Hillcrest studio. 
</P>
<P>
But as the dance maker acknowledged, creating concert dance is still a "driving 
need, and I feel privileged that my work is good enough to team up with Three's 
Company's."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: JIMMY HEATH, AT ELARIO'S, BRINGS 40 
YEARS OF GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO

<TEXT>
<P>
Jimmy Heath made his reputation as an alto sax man in the be-bop tradition of 
Charlie Parker. But he's evolved into much, much more during his more than 40 
years in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
During two weeks at Elario's, which began Wednesday night, Heath is 
concentrating on tenor sax, but he also has a flute and soprano sax in tow. 
</P>
<P>
Besides keeping up his talents on several instruments, Heath is a serious 
composer. He is working on commissioned original works for the Montreal Jazz 
Society and the Jazzmobile project in New York. He has also been writing new 
material for himself, much of which he plans to unveil at Elario's. 
</P>
<P>
Heath hasn't released a solo album for about two years, but last month he 
collaborated with several other jazzmen on a session under the leadership of 
Bill Cosby. Yes, that Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
Seems the Cos has a real thing about jazz. He chose a few tunes and brought 
together some of his favorite people to play them under his direction, 
musicians like Heath and hot young pianist Mulgrew Miller. 
</P>
<P>
With his roots in be-bop, Heath is a living treasure of jazz who survived a 
'50s battle with drugs and went on to a long, productive career. At Elario's, 
he will be joined by former San Diegan Rob Schneiderman on piano, Bob Magnusson 
on bass, John Guerin on drums the first week and Sherman Ferguson the second. 
</P>
<P>
Denver pianist-singer Ellyn Rucker is in town for her annual summer stay, which 
combines nights playing the tiny bar in the Beach House restaurant in Mission 
Beach and days of working out. 
</P>
<P>
This year's visit is especially welcomed by Rucker, who toured Europe three 
times the past year. In June, she returned from two months in France, Germany, 
Scotland and the U.K. She stopped in several small towns, such as Plymouth on 
the English Channel, where jazz fans seldom have a chance to hear live music. 
</P>
<P>
In such places, they clamored to buy copies of her albums, including last 
year's "This Heart of Mine." Sometimes, Rucker traveled by train, a shopping 
bag full of CDs in tow. 
</P>
<P>
As is generally true of European audiences, they treated her with a reverence 
rare stateside. She did a live interview and performance on BBC radio and made 
an appearance on "Music Friends," a live radio music hour. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker has two albums in the works: a duo with bassist Red Mitchell, already 
recorded; and a collaboration with saxophonist Spike Robinson, a close friend 
who also lives in Denver. She is a first-rate pianist whose swinging 
improvisations are full of surprises, and she uses her sultry voice as a jazz 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker will play Tuesday through Saturday nights through Aug. 18, except for 
this Friday and Saturday nights, when she joins flutist Holly Hofmann in the 
Horton Grand Hotel's Palace Bar downtown. 
</P>
<P>
One thing jazz purists find dislikable about commercial jazz is the emphasis on 
simple, choreographed melodies instead of fiery improvisations. 
Guitarist-keyboardist Russ Freeman and his band the Rippingtons, who play 
Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay Friday night at 7 and 9, claim to leave more 
improvisational space in their songs than most pop jazz groups. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman is a high-tech guitarist for the 1990s, feeding his instrument through 
all manner of synthesizers and electronic equipment. Sometimes the results are 
the same kind of nondescript lush music produced by many of his light jazz 
peers. But Freeman is a first-rate musician, and the group's newest album, 
"Tourist in Paradise," has won some good reviews, especially for its 
Brazilian-flavored songs. 
</P>
<P>
At press time, there were still plenty of tickets left. 
</P>
<P>
Local jazz benefactors Bob and Gretchen Geib are taking a two-month hiatus from 
the shows they present at Diego's Loft and other venues. 
</P>
<P>
With their Society for Straight Ahead Jazz, the Geibs have produced 38 shows 
the last year, dipping into their own pockets when ticket sales weren't 
sufficient to pay musicians. Bob Geib will spend some time scouring Los Angeles 
for new talent and sorting through more than 200 hours' worth of tapes he has 
made during the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he hopes to combine the best of these on a CD. The Geibs' shows 
will start again in October, with tentative bookings including former John 
Coltrane bassist Art Davis, saxophonists Gary LeFebvre and Rod Cradit and 
guitarist and alto sax man Al Kaye. The Geibs' last definite show before their 
break will be an Aug. 4 appearance by guitarist Peter Sprague at Diego's Loft, 
but Geib is also thinking about a Salmon House date for Ellyn Rucker with a 
small ensemble. 
</P>
<P>

No Berry for Knott's: Knott's Berry Farm has canceled Aug. 11-12 appearances by 
rock legend Chuck Berry. 
</P>
<P>
Charges of marijuana possession and child abuse leveled against Berry last week 
by Missouri authorities were "implied but not specifically" the cause of the 
cancellation, park spokesman Stuart Zanville said Wednesday. "All parties 
agreed it was best for him not to be here at this time. . . . Apparently there 
was a scheduling problem on his part." Zanville added that no replacement for 
Berry has been found yet. The performer's two Aug. 13 shows at the Strand in 
Redondo Beach are still on. BETH KLEID

Almost Heaven: Singer John Denver said Wednesday that he has helped establish 
an institute that will work to save the global environment. The Aspen Institute 
on Global Change, co-sponsored by the Amway Corp. of Ada, Mich., the U.N. 
Environment Program and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, will 
bring leading scientists together each summer in Aspen, Colo., to trade ideas. 
"This is not just another think tank," Denver said at a news conference in 
Washington, adding that saving the environment is "the most important task that 
faces the human race at this time." BETH KLEID

STAGE WATCH: TONY ROBERTS WILL STAR IN 'JEROME ROBBINS' BROADWAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Roberts and two actors who won Tonys for their roles in "Jerome Robbins' 
Broadway" will head the cast of the Los Angeles production, due to open Oct. 10 
at the Shubert. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, best known for his performances in Woody Allen movies, will narrate 
the show and step into a series of roles in the show's excerpts from the 
Robbins oeuvre. He has done this on Broadway since January. Jason Alexander won 
a Tony, as best leading actor in a musical, for creating these roles in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Shapiro and Scott Wise will re-create the roles that won them Tonys for 
featured acting in a musical. 
</P>
<P>
Although the rest of the casting hasn't been announced, there will be 12 fewer 
cast members in Los Angeles than there are on Broadway, said a spokesman for 
the producers. However, he added, "at no point will there be fewer dancers 
onstage. Each dancer will be doing more." 
</P>
<P>
He also reported that there will be four black cast members in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This comment was in response to a question raised by criticism of the Broadway 
production of "Robbins" for its lack of African-American performers. Actors' 
Equity officials met with the producers earlier this year to express their 
concern about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Shubert Organization chairman Gerald Schoenfeld said, "We 
are endeavoring to increase the number of Afro-Americans in the Los Angeles 
cast." At the time of the protest, he added, "we had a representative cast of 
many minorities, including Asian- and Hispanic-Americans" -- but only one 
African-American. 
</P>
<P>
There are now two blacks in the New York cast, reported the producers' 
spokesman. Director Robbins has total casting authority. 
</P>
<P>
THE PRICE OF PRYCE: "Robbins" is not the only big musical that has been 
challenged for its minority casting policies. The Equity council met Tuesday in 
New York for a long discussion on whether to grant permission for British actor 
Jonathan Pryce to star in the New York production of "Miss Saigon," where he 
would play the same Eurasian role that he created in the London production. 
</P>
<P>
Asian-American activists have urged the union to insist on the casting of an 
Asian actor in the role by using its veto power over foreign performers working 
on Broadway. The council adjourned without taking action. 
</P>
<P>
But Equity executive secretary Alan Eisenberg did issue a statement Wednesday 
that condemned "the idea that the producers wish to cast a Caucasian actor 
'painted yellow' to play the part of a Eurasian. . . . The Council further 
believes that it was always the producers' intention to cast the original actor 
in this role" -- despite a statement from the producers' casting director that 
hundreds of Asian performers were auditioned in New York, Los Angeles, Orange 
County, San Francisco, San Jose, Hawaii and Manila. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Variety, "Miss Saigon" producer Cameron Macintosh told 
Equity officials that he will call off the entire production, scheduled to open 
in March, if he can't cast Pryce. 
</P>
<P>
KISS 'CHORUS' GOODBY: They say it's for real this time. "A Chorus Line," at Las 
Palmas Theatre, will close Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The producers had announced earlier closings, then extended the show with 
half-price ticket discounts. It was most recently extended through Aug. 5 
without discounts, and "box-office receipts have fallen steadily," according to 
a statement from the producers. 
</P>
<P>
Refunds are available at point of purchase for the performances that were 
scheduled after Sunday.

FLOWER POWER FINALLY GETS ACROSS AT THE ROXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tables at the Roxy on Tuesday may have been awash with animal-rights 
literature as customers arrived, but there would be no sermons when Ireland's 
Hothouse Flowers took the stage. The group's only song that even begins to 
broach the topic, "Giving It All Away," just tosses off a vague line about 
"dolphins and killing" and lets it go at that; it's probably one of the most 
inarticulate protest songs ever written. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, articulation and song structure have never been their strong 
points. The Flowers tend to deal in what their most obvious influence, Van 
Morrison, referred to as the inarticulate speech of the heart, and their lyrics 
are rarely quotable. This is a band that, as much as any blues or rock group 
ever did, relies on the intangibility of feel to get across. 
</P>
<P>
It's a double-edged sword: When, say, the sound mix isn't right -- as it often 
isn't on the group's new, sophomore-jinxed album "Home" -- all that Celtic soul 
seems heavy-laden, burdened with the kind of earnest passion that invites 
mockery, less flower-like than boulder-like. 
</P>
<P>
But when sound and emotion come together, as they did in the last half-hour or 
so of the quintet's two-hour Roxy set, and that boulder builds up momentum, you 
might just feel transported into the presence of greatness. 
</P>
<P>
With singer Liam O'Maonlai pounding quite, ah, articulately on piano, and 
man-a-wailin'-sax Leo Barnes furiously jamming with the rest of the band 
instead of simply interjecting his solo bit here and there, feverish 
grandiosity was finally at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Less transportingly, countryman Andy White opened with an acoustic set in which 
seemingly every other number referred to his hometown, Belfast, by name, the 
sort of gambit that doesn't travel well -- not well enough, anyhow, to win much 
attention from the packed house. CHRIS WILLMAN

WHAT BECOMES A SALAD MOST?; 
</P>
<P>
OLIVE OIL: PRODUCERS HAVE SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE IT AS MORE 
HEALTHFUL THAN OTHER SALAD OILS, AND AMERICANS ARE USING MORE OF IT THAN EVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The national olive oil business has been growing at a phenomenal rate -- about 
20% a year. Why the sudden surge? "In the early days," explained Jaan Sulg, 
vice president of operations at Pompeian Inc., a brand available in the United 
States since 1908, "the country was not in a health mode, and manufacturers 
made no effort to advertise olive oil." 
</P>
<P>
But when scientists began touting monounsaturated oil as a cholesterol reducer, 
importers and manufacturers of olive oil seized the opportunity to promote 
their product. Suddenly the words "no cholesterol" appeared on product labels 
(actually no vegetable oil contains cholesterol or ever has). And manufacturers 
began to develop olive oil in new ways. 
</P>
<P>
Consider "light" olive oil, an alternative to the more pungent pure olive oil. 
"Light" olive oil consists of a blend of virgin olive oil and refined olive oil 
with impurities removed. Bertolli, which produces 70% of the light olive oil in 
the market today, introduced it to attract the large group of consumers who 
believed that olive oil was healthful but had reservations about its naturally 
strong flavor. Apparently the tactic worked. " 'Light' olive oil has been the 
most successful product in our 125-year-old history," said William C. Monroe, 
president of Bertolli U.S.A. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
The firm recently unveiled an olive oil spray made with a blend of olive oils 
and no alcohol or additives. Bertolli will also introduce a new olive oil 
called Robusto, a lighter-colored and lighter-flavored extra-virgin olive oil. 
Neither product is available in Los Angeles as of this writing. 
</P>
<P>
About 95% of the olive oil exported to the United States comes from the 
Mediterranean region. Italy and Spain are top exporters, followed by Tunisia, 
Greece and France. California is a relative newcomer to the olive oil market. 
</P>
<P>
Among the handful of olive oil companies in California, Santa Barbara Olive Co. 
in Santa Barbara, the third-largest California producer of olive oil, produces 
cold-pressed and unrefined olive oil, using surplus olives from canneries to 
make make oil in many flavors. Extra-virgin olive oil and "Geno's Garlic 
Nectar" (flavored with garlic from Gilroy) is bottled to sell at gourmet 
boutiques and specialty shops around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Wente Brothers Winery in Livermore, Calif., makes olive oil from 160 olive 
trees that were planted in 1880 and already used to make olive oil before the 
start of World War II. Wente's olive oil is made with Lucques olives, an olive 
variety from France. It also makes a mixed olive oil called Oro Misto. 
</P>
<P>
The Napa Valley Olive Oil Co., one of the oldest California-based olive oil 
manufacturers, also makes olive oil. Its production is small, and only 
available locally. 
</P>
<P>
When we did a tasting of extra-virgin olive oil at The Times, another 
California oil, the dark-green Tra Vigne oil from the Napa Valley, was the 
clear winner. At Tra Vigne restaurant in St. Helena, the oil is served as a 
prelude to a meal, poured into a small plate to be eaten as a dipping sauce for 
crusty bread. 
</P>
<P>
Pietro Coricelli, priced at $2.69 for a 16.9 ounce bottle, placed second. Some 
tasters described Pietro Coricelli as "nutty" and "mild." For the relatively 
low price, it is a good bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara Olive Co. extra-virgin olive oil shared third place with Greater 
Galilee olive oil, made from Israel's souri olive. Little Israeli oil is 
exported, most of it being consumed within the region. "I started with a keg 
last year, and now produce a couple of tons," said Ehud Yonay, president of the 
company. The product, which comes in a 12.6-ounce (375-milliliter) bottle, 
sells for about $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
The Greek brand, Peloponnese, and Bertolli extra-virgin olive oil scored fourth 
in the tasting. Bertolli is the No. 1 selling oil in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Pompeian extra-virgin olive oil, Bertolli's United States competitor, slipped 
into fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AN OLIVE OIL PRIMER: 
</P>
<P>
Olive oil is made by grinding the olives, at room temperature, into a heavy 
paste. This is traditionally done by a large granite wheel, although steel 
grindstones are also used today. The paste is then spread over stacked straw 
mats. Steel plates randomly interspersed in the press extract the olive's 
liquid, a combination of oil and water. The oil is decanted naturally or by 
centrifuge, then filtered to remove any major impurities or particles. 
</P>
<P>
Oils are divided into two major categories: virgin and pure. 
</P>
<P>
Virgin oils are natural and unrefined and have not been subjected to 
manipulation. The oils are extracted through the simple pressing of olives and 
have a light aroma, rich taste and a yellow to green color. They have a longer 
shelf life than refined oils. 
</P>
<P>
Extra-virgin olive oil is made from the finest fruit of the olive tree, and the 
oil is obtained in a single, cold pressing. Before bottling, the oil is gently 
filtered to remove natural sediments. The acidity of extra-virgin olive oil 
must be less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Fine virgin is an oil of superior flavor and aroma whose acidity is 1.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Virgin oil is smooth in flavor, and acidity is not more than 3.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Pure olive oils have been refined in order to remove impurities, hence the 
name. The process also reduces acidity and results in a rather bland product. 
Producers blend virgin or extra-virgin olive oils into pure oil to return 
flavor, color and aroma that have been lost in the filtering process. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the filtration to remove natural sediments, pure olive oil goes 
through a second filtering to lighten color and aroma and lessen acidity. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, about 70% of bottles labeled olive oil are pure. The 
acidity of pure olive oil is low: 0.18%.

YOU ASKED ABOUT: TAPENADE IS A FRENCH OLIVE SPREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Question: Growing up in Chicago I recall grocery-shopping with my mother and 
purchasing something called olive butter. It was salty, spreadable and good on 
toast or crackers. 
</P>
<P>
Would you have any idea what the recipe might be? Those of us with blenders and 
food processors could probably make this if it is no longer available 
commercially. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Perhaps you are referring to the earthy olive spread from southern 
France, tapenade. According to "Cooking A to Z" (Ortho Books: 1988) edited by 
Jane Horn, it is also used with cold roast beef or on grilled lamb chops. 
</P>
<P>
You may be able to find the spread in specialty food stores, but the book 
includes the following recipe which, as you guessed, is prepared in a blender 
or food processor. 
</P>
<P>
TAPENADE 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound large, black Greek olives or Nicoise olives, pitted 
</P>
<P>
1 ounce anchovy fillets 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons capers 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Place olives in food processor or blender. Add anchovies, garlic, capers and 
olive oil. Process or blend briefly. Mixture should be blended but still 
coarse. Transfer to bowl and season to taste with pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Store in refrigerator up to 6 months in crock or jar, covered with thin layer 
of olive oil. Makes 1 cup. 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are going to go pick our olives this year about October. Last year we did 
not seal the jars, so we lost a lot of olives. Could you please provide 
information on keeping this from happening? 
</P>
<P>
A: "Home Pickling of Olives," leaflet 2758 from the University of California, 
should answer your questions. Send a request and $1.56 ($1.25 plus 31 cents 
postage and handling) to: ANR Publications, University of California, 6701 San 
Pablo Ave., Oakland, Calif. 94608-1239. Checks should be made payable to U.C. 
Regents. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have several old recipes that call for B.V. It is no longer available in 
our area. Do you know where I can purchase some? 
</P>
<P>
A: Are you referring to bovril, a liquid beef concentrate imported from 
England? If so, it may be purchased at Tudor House, 411 Santa Monica Blvd., 
Santa Monica, (213) 451-4107. You may also be able to find it in some specialty 
food stores. 
</P>
<P>
The seasoning base is used to flavor soups, sauces and stews. Use sparingly, as 
it tends to be salty. 
</P>

LOCAL PRODUCTS: MELONS, GRAPES AND OLIVE OIL

Mediterranean chefs live and die by their choice of olive oil. At least that's 
what chef James Sly says. He should know: Earlier this summer, Sly, executive 
chef of Santa Barbara's El Encanto Hotel, won the classic division of a 
bouillabaisse contest at the Brander Vineyard in Los Olivos. His winning entry 
was a soup infused with olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
But Sly didn't use a European olive oil; he went for the extra virgin olive oil 
produced by the Santa Barbara Olive Co. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to use it because of the fruity flavor and the perfume," Sly says, "and 
also because it's a regional ingredient." 
</P>
<P>
It's a big, full-flavored oil that works well with such simple foods as 
crostini (toasted bread). Brush thin slices of French bread with the oil on one 
side and place the slices under the broiler until they are lightly toasted. 
Then turn the bread, brush the other side with olive oil and broil again. You 
can top the bread off with grated Parmesan cheese and freshly ground black 
pepper. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Barbara Olive Co. is headquartered in Solvang but distributes some of 
its products at such Los Angeles area stores as Vons, Mayfair, the Irvine Ranch 
Market, Ralphs and Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods. 
</P>
<P>
The oil comes in bottles and in quart and gallon cans. Unfortunately, the cans 
are not shipped here. Colorfully decorated with scenes of the Santa Barbara 
mission, they would make a handsome accent to a kitchen shelf. Also, the canned 
oil is less expensive. A 1-quart can is $7.99, while a 750 ml. bottle is $8.99. 
But if it is any consolation, there is a 375 ml. bottle with an attractive 
mission label too. 
</P>
<P>
Cantaloupe, honeydew, Persian, Sharlyn, canari, orange flesh, Santa Claus, 
casaba, watermelon. Those might be enough melons for most people, but 
determined aficionados hunt out such super-sweet and aromatic varieties as 
Galia and Saticoy melons, not to mention French Morning and Afternoon melons 
(no, there's no night melon). These won't be around very long, but Irvine Ranch 
Farmers Market has them now. 
</P>
<P>
The French melons are small, green-fleshed and intensely sweet. The Galia is 
slightly larger, green-fleshed and also very sweet. The Saticoy is football 
shaped, with a pale yellow skin under its natural netting. The flesh is orange 
and very aromatic. Irvine sells them all at the same price: $2.98 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
If the growers of Superior Seedless table grapes have their way, the fat and 
sassy sweet green grapes will be as famous as the mighty Thompson seedless. "We 
are trying to give (the variety) a little more identity and further 
differentiate it from Thompson seedless," says David Marguleas, spokesperson 
for Sun World International, which farms the bulk of them. 
</P>
<P>
The Thompson seedless is the top table grape in California, responsible for 
almost 50% of the crop, according to Marguleas. The upstart Superior Seedless 
already accounts for 5% of the crop, which Sun World says makes it one of three 
or four leading varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly thicker-skinned and more round than the Thompson seedless, Superior 
also has more distinctive flavor. That's because its ancestry includes a dose 
of Muscat. Picking started in the Coachella Valley in June. The grapes are now 
coming from the San Joaquin Valley and will be around until mid-August.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: OLIVE OIL: AND IT'S GOOD FOR YOU TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A few years ago, polyunsaturated was the buzz word in health circles. 
Researchers considered polyunsaturated oils the best substitutes for animal, or 
saturated, fats, and supermarket shelves sagged under the weight of the new 
heart elixir: safflower oil. 
</P>
<P>
But that's all changed. 
</P>
<P>
Monounsaturates are now the heart disease preventers of choice. One factor: the 
news that polyunsaturates might be a cancer agent. And while polys do tend to 
reduce low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or "bad" cholesterol, they also reduce 
the high-density lipoproteins (HDL), or "good" cholesterol, which removes 
cholesterol from the blood stream. (Lipoproteins are a sort of transport system 
that is in charge of moving cholesterol throughout the body.) 
</P>
<P>
The story changes when monos are substituted for saturated fats. According to 
research collected by Dr. Scott Grundy at the University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical Center at Dallas and Dr. Fred Mattson of the University of California 
at San Diego, monounsaturates reduce LDL cholesterol and maintain and even 
raise HDL levels. (It should be noted that both the Grundy and Mattson studies 
were criticized because participants got their supplies of mono, poly and 
saturated fats from liquid diets. Some wondered whether the results would be 
the same if the subjects had eaten normally.) 
</P>
<P>
But monounsaturates got a highly publicized scientific stamp of approval 
anyway. Demand is up for olive, canola and, to some extent, peanut oil. 
Safflower, corn and other polyunsaturated vegetable oils are gradually falling 
from favor. 
</P>
<P>
The trendiest of the monos is olive oil. More and more families are using olive 
oil in their salad dressing. And instead of the traditional pat of butter, many 
Americans drizzle their dinner rolls with olive oil. It's even appearing as the 
primary fat in some baked goods. 
</P>
<P>
One Italian study published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
earlier this year, showed that those who consumed large amounts of olive oil 
had lower blood cholesterol levels (including LDL), declines in blood pressure 
and drops in blood sugar compared to those people in Italian provinces with a 
heavy meat and butter diet. The study was significant because the participants 
surveyed consumed a normal diet and followed their usual living pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Still, health experts warn against adding indiscriminate amounts of olive oil 
to the diet. Since it contains the same number of calories as other fats, olive 
oil should be used, whenever possible, instead of fats such as butter, corn 
oil, lard and margarine, not on top of an already high-fat diet. 
</P>
<P>
"Because saturated fats are the real culprits in the raising of (blood 
cholesterol) levels," says Arlene Wanderman, director of the International 
Olive Oil Council, "it's wise to substitute monounsaturated fats like olive oil 
-- it's a good, healthy food. But I don't think any food is a panacea (to heart 
disease). Sloshing it all over the place is not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
"The key is that we should use all fats sparingly -- be they monounsaturated, 
saturated or polyunsaturated," says Carolyn Prosak, registered dietitian and 
spokesperson for the California Dietetic Assn. "Health recommendations say 
monounsaturates should comprise 10 to 15%, saturates less than 10% and 
polyunsaturates no more than 10%. Monos have a little better edge in the 
balance of the total diet." 
</P>
<P>
Prosak thinks olive and canola oils both fit into a balanced diet. It isn't 
necessary to choose one over the other; instead, she recommends substituting 
olive oil for animal fats in recipes when a strong flavor is desired and canola 
oil when taste isn't as important -- such as baked goods and stir-fries. (This 
allows the body's need for saturated fats to be met with other animal foods 
such as meats and cheeses.) 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even mind people using a small amount of butter for flavor," Prosak 
said. "A small amount is fine. The whole idea is variety and keeping the total 
amount low." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Schlessinger, co-author of "The Low Cholesterol Olive Oil Cookbook" 
(Villard Books: $19.95), discovered the benefits of olive oil not long after 
her husband had a heart attack. Her book offers recipes for using olive oil in 
place of animal fats in a wide assortment of dishes, though she also emphasizes 
that it is important to limit consumption of total fat, including 
monounsaturates, to 30% of the day's total calories. 
</P>
<P>
She suggests using olive oil in baking, stir-frying and, she says, "things that 
you don't normally think of for olive oil" to achieve the cholesterol-lowering 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
In her oven-fried chicken, for example, cornmeal and flour coat skinned chicken 
pieces, and olive oil is lightly drizzled on before baking. Her rum-raisin 
orange cake calls for a mild, light-flavored olive oil in place of the 
traditional fat. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that people are surprised to find that olive oil is even in these 
dishes," she says.

BACK TO BASICS: CRABS: GET 'EM WHILE THEY'RE SOFT 
</P>

Blue crabs, found along the Atlantic Coast from Massachusetts to Florida and in 
the Gulf of Mexico, shed their shells once each year. This is a natural part of 
the shellfish's growth cycle and occurs between April and September. 
</P>
<P>
The new shell begins to harden in four to five days, but crabs harvested just 
after molting are almost entirely edible and considered a culinary delicacy. 
Soft-shelled crabs are available fresh now through August, frozen the rest of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Blue crabs are one of the smaller varieties, weighing between 4 ounces and 16 
ounces and averaging 5 inches to 7 inches across the back. During harvesting, 
fishermen look for crabs with red-tipped claws -- an indication that the animal 
will shed its shell within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their small size, allow one crab as an appetizer serving, two to 
three for an entree. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare soft-shelled crabs for cooking, use kitchen scissors to cut a strip 
from the front just behind the eyes (Step 1). This also removes the mouth and 
antennae. 
</P>
<P>
If a yellowish sand bag (the stomach) is present, remove and discard. Rinse the 
crab well under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
Turn the crab on its back and remove the apron (triangular in females, T-shaped 
in males) by prying it up with your fingers, then pulling down and away (Step 
2). This will probably twist away easily, but if not, cut it away with 
scissors. Discard along with the intestinal tract that is attached. 
</P>
<P>
Turning the crab over again, lift the soft top shell at each pointed end. 
Remove and discard the spongy gills (Step 3), then rinse the crab again with 
cold water and pat dry. 
</P>
<P>
The cleaned crabs are typically dredged in a mixture of flour and cornmeal, 
seasoned to taste with salt and pepper. Then they are sauteed in equal parts of 
butter and oil for about 10 minutes, turning once, until browned on both sides.

GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER? -- THE PRESIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
RESTAURANTS: CHIEF EXECUTIVES USUALLY GIVE UP DINING OUT, BUT NOT THIS ONE. 
GEORGE BUSH IS KNOWN FOR ROARING OUT OF THE OVAL OFFICE AND INTO HIS FAVORITE 
EATERY. 
</P>

Read his lips: Sichuan Beef Proper, baked stuffed lobster, whiskey steak, 
chicken fajitas. There's nothing like a good meal to chase those S&amp;L blues 
away. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush, who never met a menu he didn't like, eats out in restaurants about 
once a month -- more than any President in recent history. Whenever he finds 
himself with a free evening and a craving for Chinese food, he slips out of the 
White House and into a corner table for a little Yan Chow fried rice. Just like 
your average all-American guy. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not exactly. Where the President is concerned, there's no such thing as a 
casual dinner on the town. 
</P>
<P>
Your average guy doesn't have someone who brings special bottled water for him 
to drink. Or salt, pepper and sugar for his table. Or an entourage of White 
House staff, Secret Service and reporters in tow. 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention the food taster. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Virginia, the President does have a food taster. And no, the White House 
will not comment on food tasters -- or anything else, for that matter -- when 
it comes to protecting the Presidential palate. 
</P>
<P>
But whenever the chief executive goes out to eat, there's a man in the kitchen 
standing over the food. Sometimes he just watches; sometimes he digs right in. 
</P>
<P>
The night the First Couple went to I Ricchi, an Italian restaurant in downtown 
Washington, the food taster washed their plates, glasses and utensils before 
the meal and kept them in sight at all times; tasted every dish to be served to 
the President; watched as the food was put on the plates and served; and 
uncorked and tasted the bottle of wine reserved exclusively for the President 
and Mrs. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
In April, right after traces of benzene were found in Perrier water, Bush joked 
with an audience in Indianapolis: "I'm sorry I couldn't get over here to have 
lunch with you today; I wasn't allowed to. On the way over I was notified that 
the Secret Service had found my food taster face down in the salad. Somebody 
had washed my lettuce with Perrier." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Presidents give up public dining when they move into 1600 
Pennsylvania Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon occasionally strolled across Lafayette Square, Secret Service alongside, 
for dinner at Trader Vic's at the Capital Hilton. Ford and Carter rarely dined 
out. The Reagans, especially after the assassination attempt in 1981, kept 
close to the White House for meals. When Nancy Reagan did venture out, she 
favored the cloistered atmosphere of the Jockey Club. 
</P>
<P>
But George Bush, determined to maintain as normal a lifestyle as possible, 
roars out of the Oval Office and into one of his favorite restaurants at the 
drop of a Daily Special. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurants love it, of course. It inevitably boosts business. And it's a 
big thrill for other customers. 
</P>
<P>
But any spontaneous jaunt is a complicated logistical maneuver for the Secret 
Service. His security staff gets nervous when the President goes out in public 
and even more nervous when he does it unexpectedly. But these excursions are 
safer than his announced appearances in two respects: There's the element of 
surprise -- what the public doesn't know can't hurt him. And he goes out to 
restaurants so often, they've got the drill down pat. 
</P>
<P>
When George and Robert Tsui get a call from the Secret Service reserving Table 
N-17, they know exactly what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
By now, the two brothers who run the Peking Gourmet Inn in Falls Church are old 
hands at handling the hullabaloo that accompanies a visit from the First 
Customer -- it's the President's favorite spot for a family dinner. Bush has 
been a VIP customer of the restaurant for the past five years and still stops 
by every couple of months: He came right before his inauguration, on the eve of 
the trips to Poland and Colombia, and to celebrate his son Marvin's birthday, 
to name a few occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"They treat this, just like any other American family, as their little favorite 
Chinese restaurant," says Robert Tsui. "We try to be as low-key as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Low-key, all things considered. The President is brought in one of the 
restaurant's seven doors; it varies each time and is always a last-minute 
decision by the security detail. There are Secret Service agents and police 
both inside and surrounding the restaurant. Customers are waved with a portable 
metal detector when they arrive for dinner. And then there's the taster . . . 
er, make that "nutrition expert." 
</P>
<P>
"When President Bush was vice president, he didn't have a nutrition expert in 
the kitchen," says George Tsui. "After he became President, the nutrition 
expert stays in the kitchen to understand what he's eating." 
</P>
<P>
The President sits at a big round table in a partitioned area that has a 
bulletproof window installed by the Tsuis. The Secret Service waits right on 
the other side of the partition, and only the Tsuis and waiter Tak Chung Pang 
-- all wearing official pins -- are allowed past. Bush reportedly wields a mean 
chopstick and is partial to the Sichuan Beef Proper, a spicy shredded-beef dish 
with roasted sesame seeds; Peking duck; and the giant spring onions the Tsuis 
grow on their Virginia farm. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner the President comes into the dining room to greet customers. 
"There's no better attraction than the No. 1 man -- wherever you go," says 
Robert Tsui. "Whether they are Democrat or Republican, whether they politically 
agree with the man or not, they always love the fact that they're dining with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
An "above average" tipper (20%), Bush pays most of the time by check, which the 
Tsuis cash. "The thing is, it would be abusing the privilege not to cash the 
check, because the check may be more valuable uncashed," Robert explained. "We 
cash them out of respect to the President." 
</P>
<P>
But elsewhere in the country, there's at least one Bush check on display: 
"George Bush, Business Account, The White House" -- now hanging on the wall of 
Patsy Clark's restaurant in Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Tom Foley invited Bush, who was visiting Washington state for its 
centennial celebration, to join him, his wife, Heather, and Environmental 
Protection Agency Director Bill Reilly for dinner there last fall. Foley had 
intended to pick up the tab, but the President pulled rank and paid the $121 
bill with a check for $140. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, a newspaper article said owner Tony Anderson planned to keep 
and frame the check as a souvenir. "About 2 p.m. that day, a Secret Service guy 
showed up at the restaurant with an envelope," says Anderson. "It was a 
thank-you note from Bush with $140 in cash enclosed. He wanted to pay for 
dinner. He was insistent on it." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson only had 20 minutes' notice of the Presidential supper, which had been 
reserved under the name of an assistant to the President. There were Secret 
Service agents "everywhere -- 35 or 40 guys" including, says Anderson, the one 
who brought salt, pepper, sugar and bottled water for the table in a shopping 
bag. The food taster watched, but did not sample, the President's medium-rare 
Jack Daniel's whiskey steak. Anderson found out later that the Secret Service 
had been visiting his restaurant for two weeks, posing as regular customers, 
and had the place thoroughly staked out. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a wonderful person to have as a customer," says Anderson. But having 
both Bush and Foley under his roof was nonetheless nerve-racking. "I was 
thinking, 'These guys are two of the most powerful people in the world. What if 
something happens?' I was actually sort of relieved when they left." 
</P>
<P>
Until it happens, no restaurant can imagine what goes into a visit from the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
The operative word is secret. 
</P>
<P>
Palm owner Wally Ganzi, who is also a personal friend of the President, knew 
several weeks in advance that the Bushes would join him and his wife, Reva, 
along with actress Cheryl Ladd and her husband, Brian Russell, for sirloin 
steak, onion rings and cheesecake last November. But his staff was told only 
the day before, when the Secret Service arrived to inspect the premises. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone should pay the Secret Service a compliment," says Ganzi. "They really 
try their best in every possible way. They're not rude, very courteous. They 
really try not to disturb your business. They don't strong-arm you." The one 
thing they really concentrate on is egress -- the quickest way to get the 
President out if there's a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Christianne and Francesco Ricchi, on the other hand, got the shock of their 
lives when I Ricchi's owners found out they'd be cooking for a very VIP guest 
-- only one month after the restaurant opened last year. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband approached me and said, 'You will never guess who's coming to 
dinner,' " says Christianne Ricchi. "The Secret Service flashed their badges 
and says, 'Are you the owner?' He thought it was immigration." 
</P>
<P>
The couple only had two hours' notice to prepare for the presidential 
appearance at the dinner, hosted by former Bush speech writer Vic Gold. "Our 
concern was making sure that everything was absolutely perfect," says 
Christianne Ricchi. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Secret Service searched the restaurant, brought in bomb-sniffing 
dogs, stationed men outside all the entrances and on the roof across the 
street, and brought in the food taster, who played an unusually active role -- 
sampling all the food and wine. 
</P>
<P>
Time and security were equally tight in May when the Bushes joined former 
Republican National Committee chairman Dean Burch and his wife, Pat, for dinner 
at La Chaumiere in Georgetown. Antoine de Ponfilly, who served the Presidential 
party, found out at 5 p.m. that "someone important" was coming that night, but 
the Secret Service would not say who it was. 
</P>
<P>
The Secret Service chose the private room upstairs for the President and then 
positioned two men on the roof, two in the back, three on the stairs and "a 
lot" in front of the tiny French restaurant, de Ponfilly says. 
</P>
<P>
When the Bushes went up to eat, customers were inspected with portable metal 
detectors but didn't find out who was in the restaurant until Bush came 
downstairs after dinner. 
</P>
<P>
It was more down-home last July at Rio Grande Cafe, the Tex-Mex restaurant in 
Bethesda, when Bush and fellow Texan Robert Mosbacher, the secretary of 
commerce, came in for quesadillas, cheese enchiladas, beef and chicken fajitas 
and the specialty of the house: mesquite-broiled quail. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Jerry Green noticed two police cars in front of the restaurant when he 
arrived at 3 p.m. Three hours later, the Secret Service toured the restaurant 
and picked a table for Bush in a back corner. 
</P>
<P>
The food taster asked Green to point out what food would be served to the 
Presidential party. Green pointed to the 40 pounds of beef already cooking on 
the grill. 
</P>
<P>
"He got the same old stuff that everybody gets here," says Green. "Honestly, 
I'm not going to change my food just for the President. But I did give him an 
extra quail. I figured I could do that much for him." 
</P>
<P>
The party lasted two hours and everyone else in the restaurant lingered to 
watch Bush tackle his fajitas; since he sat facing the front, the customers 
could get a good look. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody would leave," says Green. "The Secret Service finally closed the door 
when we were filled to capacity with a two-hour wait." 
</P>
<P>
After Mosbacher paid the bill with his American Express card, Green grabbed the 
chair Bush had been sitting in "right after he finished with it." Within two 
days it was back on the floor -- painted red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
When Mabel Hanson of Mabel's Lobster Claw Restaurant in Kennebunkport, Me., 
curls her hair, you know something's up. 
</P>
<P>
"The President said, 'Hiya, Mabel. How are you? What are you all dressed up 
for?' " says Hanson, who just happened to be spiffed up when Bush dropped by 
last year. "I cried when he came -- just a few sniffles. I can't help it. It's 
the President coming through your door." 
</P>
<P>
Mabel's has been a Bush family favorite for almost 20 years. There's a whole 
wall devoted to the Bushes: lots of pictures of George and Barbara, a few of 
George and Mabel, a portrait of the President with "He's Our George" above it 
and a banner from the President's inauguration -- Mabel's first trip ever to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
You can usually pick out the Secret Service: They're the only guys in 
Kennebunkport wearing suits. 
</P>
<P>
Bush sits at his favorite corner table, where he usually has lobster stuffed 
with sea scallops. He's "not too much for desserts" but occasionally treats 
himself to butter-crunch ice cream or Mabel's famous peanut butter ice cream 
pie. 
</P>
<P>
"These people couldn't change if they tried," she says. "They're as natural as 
grass growing." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Bushes and daughter Dorothy Bush LeBlond went to the 
Breakwater Inn in Kennebunkport with Bush golfing buddy Spike Heminway, his 
wife, Betsy, and daughter Alex. Unlike most dinner visits, owner Carolyn 
Lambert got advance word when Heminway made the reservation the night before 
and said the Bushes would be joining them. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very important to me that this didn't get out of hand," Lambert says. 
"I told my employees when they came in the next night, 'If you told any of your 
friends to come down here and hang around, call them back and tell them not to 
come.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the Secret Service and a White House staffer showed up and told 
Lambert, "There need to be people in the dining room. If Mr. Bush felt you were 
going to lose business because of him, he would be unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant, not surprisingly, was full of the inn's regular customers and a 
few enterprising reporters who had wheedled reservations that afternoon for the 
remaining tables. Except for the food taster in the kitchen, it was a typical 
Sunday-night dinner in Maine. The President had the pan-fried chicken breast 
special and mud pie. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush goes to his other hometown, he usually makes a beeline for Otto's 
Barbecue in Houston, where he chows down on pork ribs or link sausage with 
beans. 
</P>
<P>
On his first visit there as President, the Secret Service checked out the 
bathrooms and sneaked Bush through the back door into the back dining room. 
"But the customers knew something was up," says manager June Sofka. "Then the 
President came in the main dining room and shook hands with everybody. It was 
just exhilarating." 
</P>
<P>
"I was busy running around so I didn't get my picture taken with the President. 
But I picked up his plate and the silverware and took it home. I still have 
it."

PERFECTLY COOKED FISH DOESN'T FLAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cooking fish continues to be a challenge to many home cooks. Making sure that 
the fish is just cooked but still moist is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
And the old idea that you should cook fish until it flakes with a fork is 
totally misleading, resulting in overcooked, somewhat dry fish. Mark Grosz of 
Oceanique has some good advice: let the fish finish cooking off the heat after 
it's just barely cooked. That gives you more control -- and leaves you less 
likely to overcook the fish. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
* Whether sauteing fillets in a skillet or poaching them in liquid, always wash 
and dry very well with paper towels. Season well to taste with herbs, salt and 
pepper, rubbing seasonings into the filleted surface (as opposed to the skin 
side). 
</P>
<P>
* To cook in a skillet, a non-stick surface is recommended. Heat olive oil (a 
nicely flavored oil but not extra-virgin) in non-stick skillet. When hot, place 
skin side down first to crisp fillet. (If fish is skinned, place filleted side 
down.) Cook over medium high heat, uncovered, until golden brown on one side, 
about 3 to 4 minutes. Use flat spatula to carefully turn over. Turn heat off. 
Cover skillet. Depending on thickness of fillet, let stand about 2 to 4 more 
minutes to finish cooking. 
</P>
<P>
* To poach in liquid, preheat oven to 400 degrees. Rub olive oil on seasoned 
surface of fish and bottom of non-aluminum pan that is just large enough to 
hold the fish arranged in a single layer. Place filleted side down, add cold 
poaching liquid and cover with piece of parchment paper. Place in oven, and 
bake until fish is barely cooked, about 15 to 20 minutes, depending on 
thickness of fish. Remove from oven and let finish cooking for 5 more minutes.

REDUCING THE RISKS WHEN EATING FISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
What's a seafood lover to do these days? While the politicians and pressure 
groups continue to debate turf battles over mandatory seafood inspection, the 
guy on the street is stuck wondering whether his favorite fish dish is safe to 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, not even the diehards who are screaming for safer seafood, advises 
eliminating this healthful food from a diet. But everyone from the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration to consumer advocacy groups agree that you can reduce 
the risk of illness or death. The following advice is compiled from Public 
Voice for Food and Health Policy, the Center for Science in the Public Interest 
and FDA. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eat a variety of different kinds of fish and shellfish. Do not concentrate 
on only a few species. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Select young or small fish because they have had less time to accumulate 
contaminants in their flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trim away the skin and any dark flesh before cooking. The highest chemical 
contaminants concentrate in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't eat the mustard in blue crabs or the tomalley in lobsters; PCBs and 
cadmium concentrate in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shellfish taken from contaminated waters can causes viruses, the bulk of 
seafood-associated diseases. Avoid raw shellfish if you have chronic liver or 
kidney problems, diabetes or any disease that impairs the immune system, such 
as AIDS or AIDS-related complex. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Forget the trendy undercooked fish that is popular in many restaurants. 
Fish should be heated to 140 degrees in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When cooking clams, mussels and oysters, allow them to sit in hot water for 
five minutes after the shells have opened. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, avoid bluefish, striped bass, 
swordfish, shark or any freshwater fish. The bluefish and bass often accumulate 
high levels of PCBs. Swordfish and shark often contain methyl mercury. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Limit tuna consumption, fresh and canned, to 8 ounces a week because of 
methyl mercury contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Avoid the larger reef fish: grouper, snapper, barracuda and Spanish 
mackerel are the chief candidates for ciguatoxin. Because the toxin is heat 
stable, cooking does not make the fish safe to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scombroid poisoning can result in certain fish that aren't stored properly 
and form histamines. The three fish typically associated with these complaints 
include tuna, mahi-mahi and bluefish. The heat-stable toxin often gives the 
fish a peppery taste. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When buying or ordering fish, make sure to ask where it was caught. If it 
is caught near shore or industrial pollutants, you may want to reconsider.

NURSING HOME MIGHT APPEAL FINE FOR ABUSE; 
</P>
<P>
ELDERLY CARE: THE $10,000 PENALTY WAS LEVIED AFTER A NURSE'S AIDE ALLEGEDLY 
RAPED A PATIENT. OFFICIALS MAINTAIN THAT THE HOME IS NOT RESPONSIBLE. 
</P>

<P>
Autumn Hills Convalescent Home officials said they probably will appeal a 
$10,000 fine levied by Los Angeles County officials after an elderly patient 
was allegedly raped at the facility by a nurse's aide. 
</P>
<P>
Officials representing Autumn Hills have argued that the Glendale nursing home 
is not responsible for the actions of employee Roy Alton Seaton, a 45-year-old 
Burbank resident who had a prior conviction for a sexual offense that Autumn 
Hills officials were unaware of. 
</P>
<P>
Seaton allegedly attacked an 82-year-old patient who was suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease. He has pleaded not guilty and is in County Jail awaiting 
an Aug. 14 preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
On July 5, about a week after the alleged attack, the county Department of 
Health Services fined the home $10,000 because a resident suffered physical and 
sexual abuse, and $1,000 because Seaton's background was not checked properly 
before he was hired, said Spencer Barr, an assistant supervisor with county 
Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Although both citations remain on the nursing home's record, the lesser fine 
was dropped after the home agreed to ensure that in the future the references 
of job applicants would be checked to verify they had state certification for 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Autumn Hills, however, argue that the home should not be blamed 
because its operators must depend on a system for obtaining and sharing 
information about nurse's aides that is too complex. It requires them to know 
about an employee's past but makes it very difficult for them to obtain the 
information, the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Seaton's criminal record dates to September, 1983, when he was convicted of 
lewd and lascivious conduct with a child and put on six years' probation. The 
conviction, however, did not directly threaten Seaton's livelihood because it 
did not involve a patient or occur at a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, a convicted child molester can work as a nurse's aide -- 
provided the offense did not occur at a nursing facility or involve a patient, 
county officials said. If a nurse's aide is convicted of abuse or neglect of a 
nursing home patient, the offense is automatically reported to the state 
Department of Health Services, which revokes the aide's certification, said 
Mary Louise Mock, a state Health Services assistant deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
Seaton, who was certified as a nurse's aide in 1979, joined Golden State 
Colonial Convalescent Hospital in North Hollywood in October, 1986. His wife, 
also a nurse's aide, got a job there too, said Bette Zimmer, the home's 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Zimmer said that Seaton and his wife were excellent employees 
and that she did not know when she hired Seaton that he had been convicted of 
child molestation. Zimmer said she followed standard procedures in hiring him: 
She called state Health Services to make sure his certification was valid, and 
she called his references to verify his former employment. 
</P>
<P>
Neither method, however, offered any substantial information about his past, 
Zimmer said. Industry and county officials said that generally is the case: 
Former employers, fearful of lawsuits, are reluctant to give out information 
about employees, even to other nursing homes. And the state certification hot 
line tells only whether an aide's certification is valid. 
</P>
<P>
There is no uniform system nursing homes can use to obtain information about 
employees' criminal backgrounds and in many instances, the information is 
confidential, said Rod Leonard, in charge of the district attorney's nursing 
home and dependent care branch. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just call me up and say, 'Rod, can you check my boyfriend's records 
to see if he has any criminal past,' " Leonard said. "There's a right to 
privacy involved in criminal records." 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer said Seaton left Golden State in April, 1988, for a better paying job at 
Riverdale Convalescent Center in Glendale. Like Zimmer, Kathleen Reinke, then 
administrator of Riverdale, said she did not know of Seaton's conviction when 
he was hired. But several months later, she received anonymous complaints that 
he was treating residents roughly and heard rumors that he was on probation for 
a sex offense. 
</P>
<P>
Reinke, who now administers Brighton Convalescent Center in Pasadena, said she 
confronted Seaton about the complaints and rumors. She said Seaton told her 
that he had been accused of child molestation, but that the charge was 
unsubstantiated. Reinke said she suspended him from resuming work until he 
could provide proof from a legal authority that it was safe for him to work 
with the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1988, she got such a letter -- from Seaton's probation officer. 
The letter acknowledged Seaton's offense and said there was no documented 
evidence that suggested that child molesters posed a threat to ill or elderly 
adults, according to Carol Koelle, regional director of the county probation 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Because the complaints seemed to be unsubstantiated and because the law does 
not prohibit convicted child molesters from working as nurse's aides, Reinke 
allowed him to return to his job, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Seaton, whose probation expired in April, 1989, left Riverdale in July and was 
hired at Autumn Hills in August. Months later, during an early morning shift on 
June 27, a supervisor allegedly caught Seaton raping and sodomizing a resident. 
Seaton was arrested a day later and charged with three felony counts of sexual 
assault. He also was fired, said Tami Smason, Autumn Hills' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Smason said Seaton had been known as a "helpful and fine" employee. The home 
had no way of knowing about his criminal record because he lied when he wrote 
on his job application that he had never been convicted of a felony, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Smason refused to say whether Autumn Hills checked Seaton's references. County 
officials, however, said the home failed to do so. If it had, the officials 
charged, it would have learned about his past and considered it in the decision 
to hire him. 
</P>
<P>
"The law says that each facility should establish personnel policies and 
procedures that should include verification of license, credentials and 
references," Barr said. "Yes, it's up to each facility to decide how to do it . 
. . but if you're not doing it thoroughly, you take a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Obtaining information about nurse's aides may become easier. All states, 
including California, are establishing hot lines that will offer more 
information about nurse's aides, such as whether a conviction or substantiated 
complaints of abuse ever have been lodged against an aide, Mock said. 
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive criminal records are available through the U.S. Department of 
Justice for some kinds of care facilities, such as homes for the 
developmentally disabled. A bill by Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly 
(D-Sacramento) pending in the Legislature would give nursing homes the same 
access to those records. 
</P>
<P>
But some industry officials said they will oppose the bill if it means that 
homes will have to employ costly, time-consuming measures to obtain records. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a segment of the labor market where people aren't coming in with fat 
resumes and a lot of work experience. There are always problems ascertaining 
prior work history," said Dave Helmsin, program director for the California 
Assn. of Health Facilities, a trade group for most of the 1,250 nursing homes 
in the state. "Still, we can't support anything that seriously inhibits our 
ability to recruit employees."

BENEDICT CANYON CLOSING FOR 4 MONTHS FOR ROADWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what is expected to cause a prolonged traffic headache for thousands of Los 
Angeles commuters, Benedict Canyon Drive will close for about four months 
starting in mid-August while construction crews rebuild a 2.1-mile stretch of 
the crumbling canyon roadway. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.1-million project will divert thousands of drivers between the Westside 
and the San Fernando Valley to already-packed freeways and neighboring 
thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly hard hit will be the parallel canyon roads -- Beverly Glen and 
Laurel Canyon boulevards, Coldwater Canyon Drive and Roscomare Road -- and the 
main east-west roads at the top and bottom of the canyons, Mulholland Drive and 
Sunset Boulevard. The Benedict Canyon closure comes at a time when traffic woes 
have become the major concern of the affluent hillside residents between Sunset 
and Ventura boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be 'Apocalypse Now,' but it is going to be bad," said Capt. 
Vance Proctor, commander of the traffic division for the western division of 
the Los Angeles Police Department. "There will definitely be an increase in 
traffic on other roads and it will tack on extra long hours during the commute 
period." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hardship, Benedict Canyon homeowners support the city's plans to 
rebuild the road from Hutton Drive to the Beverly Hills city limits because the 
highway is filled with huge potholes and gaping cracks. City engineers say the 
road has deteriorated so much that patchwork repairs would be useless and they 
are concerned about motorists' safety. 
</P>
<P>
The Benedict Canyon Homeowners Assn. held several meetings with city officials 
to work out project details, including the best time to resurface the road. 
Although they both agreed that the best time to start would be in July, when 
most schools are out, federal funds were not available so the project was 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
"The road is in poor condition and it has needed to be resurfaced for years," 
said Fred Hamer, president of the homeowners group. "There's no doubt it will 
cause some problems, but the long-term benefits make it worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, neighboring canyon homeowners are dreading the coming months. 
Already complaining that it sometimes takes 10 minutes to get out of their 
driveways into the bumper-to-bumper commute traffic, they predict that even 
simple trips to the store will take twice as long. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to aggravate a bad situation substantially," said Gerald Haims, a 
member of the Coldwater Canyon Homeowners Assn. "It's a great concern for all 
of us who live here. It's going to be a very, very irritating time. 
</P>
<P>
"The real problem is not the people who live in the canyons -- they are very 
tolerant of each other. But that's not true of the commuter traffic. Even when 
the cars are at a dead standstill, they won't even let you in." 
</P>
<P>
Tentatively scheduled to begin in mid-August, the first part of the project 
calls for the reconstruction of Benedict Canyon between the Beverly Hills city 
boundary and Hillgrove Drive. Once the work begins, the canyon road will be 
closed by barricades between Hillgrove and Mulholland Drive, with only 
homeowners, service people, visitors and emergency vehicles allowed through. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic officials will give Benedict Canyon residents three access permits for 
their cars and a private access code. Service people and visitors will be 
required to give a correct address and matching access code to be admitted by 
security officials at the barricades. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic signals on parts of Mulholland Drive and Sunset Boulevard will be 
adjusted to compensate for the heavier traffic, and extra police officers will 
be assigned to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"People will make adjustments and you find that in cases like this, traffic 
isn't as bad as you might expect," said Brian Griffith, district engineer for 
the project. "There are going to be areas where no matter what we try to do, 
there's going to be more congestion. 
</P>
<P>
However, Griffith acknowledges that the size and the length of the project pose 
special problems for residents with high levels of traffic intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a different order of magnitude to hold the line for four 
months, as opposed to six weeks for most projects," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
As an added incentive to finish the project within four months, the contractor, 
Security Paving Co., has a clause in its contract that will earn the company 
$5,000 for each day the job is finished early. If the project runs over 
schedule, the company will be penalized $2,000 per day. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon residents and city traffic officials say they will do whatever they can 
to move the project along as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a similar thing on Beverly Glen (in 1988) and everybody survived," 
Proctor said. "It's not going to be an easy time and I know a lot of people are 
concerned. But still, I can't imagine it would be any worse than (driving on) 
the 405." 
</P>
<P>
The project: Reconstruction of a 2.1-mile stretch of Benedict Canyon Drive, 
from the Beverly Hills city line to Hutton Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Barricades: Once work begins, all access points to the canyon will be 
barricaded. The barricades will be staffed around the clock by security guards. 
During working hours, access from the north will be controlled at Mulholland 
Drive. At night and on Sundays, it will be controlled from Hutton Drive. 
</P>
<P>
BENEDICT CANYON DRIVE RECONSTRUCTION 
</P>
<P>
Barricades will be placed on Benedict Canyon Drive at: 
</P>
<P>
* The Beverly Hills city line 
</P>
<P>
* Hillgrove Drive intersection 
</P>
<P>
* Cielo Drive intersection 
</P>
<P>
* Just north of Hutton Drive 
</P>
<P>
* Just south of Mullholland Drive 
</P>
<P>
* Deep Canyon Drive near Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
Work schedule: The project is expected to start in mid-August and last until 
mid-December. Scheduled work hours are 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Access: Canyon residents displaying resident permits in their vehicles will be 
waved through the barricades with minimal delay; these permits will be issued 
three per dwelling shortly before construction begins. In addition, an access 
code system will be set up so that residents can arrange for visitors and 
service workers to enter the construction area. Details of the access code 
system will be mailed to residents. 
</P>
<P>
First phase: The highest priority will be the reconstruction of the roadway 
from the Beverly Hills city line to Hillgrove Drive. When this is completed, 
access to this southern portion of the affected area will no longer be 
restricted.

BID FOR VOTE BY DISTRICT IS SHELVED; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: A GROUP AIMING TO INCREASE MINORITY REPRESENTATION ON THE CITY 
COUNCIL BY SHIFTING FROM AT-LARGE ELECTIONS SUFFERS A SETBACK.

The Santa Monica City Council has rebuffed a citizens group that was seeking to 
place on the November ballot a measure that would replace the at-large system 
of council representation with a district system and limit council members to 
two consecutive terms in office. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the council voted Tuesday to refer the issue to a Charter commission, 
as yet unnamed, that would be charged with studying a number of issues, 
including council pay raises. The unanimous vote followed a lengthy public 
hearing during which impassioned speakers said it was imperative to elect 
council members by district to give minorities a voice in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've been in Santa Monica, the City Council has been as white as any 
council in darkest Orange County," said Henry McGee, a UCLA law professor. 
</P>
<P>
Only two blacks have ever served on the council, and there has never been a 
Latino member. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that about 20,000 Latinos live in the city of 97,000, 
many of them in the Pico neighborhood, which was repeatedly mentioned Tuesday 
night as lacking a voice at City Hall. "Latinos continue to be the invisible 
and silent minority," said Blanca Malpartida-Girard. "Their lack of 
representation is directly attributable to at-large elections." 
</P>
<P>
Recent court rulings, such as one pertaining to the city of Watsonville, have 
concluded that at-large elections in some California cities have prevented 
minorities from winning office. But Santa Monica City Atty. Robert Myers said 
in a telephone interview that the city is not legally required to shift to 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Many at the public hearing also complained that rent control has been the 
driving force behind Santa Monica elections for years, leading to a system 
where only those candidates allied with politically potent and well-financed 
special interest groups stand a chance of being elected. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a true election in Santa Monica," said Joel Goldfarb. "It's one 
power situation against another. . . . Money and class is driving the electoral 
process." 
</P>
<P>
A limit of two consecutive terms is needed to dilute the power of incumbents, 
speakers said. 
</P>
<P>
The few who spoke in opposition to the idea said they preferred having all 
seven council members accountable to the entire populace, as it is now. "I come 
from the other side," said Russell Shaver. "I would lose the right to hold each 
and every one of you responsible for your actions." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal for the elections by district and two-term limit is the work of a 
group called Citizens United to Reform Elections, whose members said they have 
been trying to advance the idea for two years. They did not collect signatures 
on petitions to qualify the measure for the ballot, saying they lack the 
financial resources to do so. Instead, they asked the City Council to put the 
issue to the voters as a "good government" measure. 
</P>
<P>
CURE includes representatives of local Democratic clubs, local chapters of the 
Mexican American Political Assn. and a minority not typically included in 
under-represented groups in other less liberal municipalities: Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Before voting with their colleagues to refer CURE's proposal to the Charter 
commission, council members David Finkel and Ken Genser said they strongly 
supported elections by district even though the two were themselves elected on 
a Santa Monica for Renters Rights slate. 
</P>
<P>
Finkel said that though some might argue civil rights is already a prime value 
in Santa Monica, "whenever there's an opportunity to advance it, you should." 
</P>
<P>
District elections will not harm rent control, Genser said, but will broaden 
the number of issues addressed and provide a council that reflects the ethnic 
diversity of the community. "Perhaps the reason we don't want to face district 
elections is we don't want to talk about issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, a ballot measure to create district elections failed. In 1988, 
Proposition J, which would have created numbered citywide council districts, 
was also defeated. The CURE group opposed the proposition on the grounds that 
it would protect incumbents and hinder minorities.

DESPITE CUTS, UCLA IS USING MORE WATER; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: CITY'S SEVENTH-LARGEST CONSUMER SAYS IT HAS MADE EFFORTS TO SAVE 
WATER. BUT USAGE HAS INCREASED 20% SINCE '85-86, AND IS LIKELY TO KEEP GOING 
UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
UCLA is the city's seventh-largest water user. Last year it used about as much 
water as a city the size of Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For its acres of lush, verdant lawns. 
</P>
<P>
For round-the-clock showers for youthful dormitory dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
To chill out. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of campus water use is for climate control, essential so that 
fancy, but finicky, research equipment can churn out data without breaking a 
sweat, campus officials said. 
</P>
<P>
So, one could expect the school to really help out a lot in these drought days 
if it cut back its usage by 10%, as Mayor Tom Bradley has requested of all 
water users. 
</P>
<P>
But despite efforts the university says it has made to conserve water, 
Department of Water and Power records show the campus increased consumption by 
20% since 1985-86, the base period used by the city. So, if the university were 
to try to cut its usage by 10% from that period, it would be faced with the 
daunting task of cutting back 30% from its latest usage figures. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to its own calculations, UCLA will need at least 45% more water 
if all of the remaining expansion projects in its already-scaled-back 15-year 
development plan become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA used 1.2 billion gallons of water in 1988-89. The current enrollment of 
the school is about 34,000, with more than 20,000 employees, although most 
students are commuters and do not live on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Community members opposed to the scope of UCLA's development plan cite the 
water figures as evidence of the university's wastefulness, charging UCLA with 
gobbling up an unseemly amount of resources in an era of limits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an environmental-be-damned attitude," said Alvin Milder, leader of UCLA 
Watch, a group of Westwood neighbors that keeps an eye on campus doings. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, however, views itself as in the vanguard of voluntary conservation. And, 
university officials say, the school has made great strides on its own. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be happy to have the university's activities put up aside others" for 
comparison, said Vice Chancellor Raymond Schultze, a physician who oversees 
campus facilities and is director of UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Schultze said the university's water consumption must be considered as part of 
a larger policy evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's mission, including education, research and positive economic impact on 
the area's economy, serves society well, Schultze said. "We feel it may be well 
worth the additional water to enhance that." 
</P>
<P>
Most of UCLA's water conservation has been achieved by changing the chemical 
water treatment for the cooling system to cut down on sediments. The change, 
which means that the equipment doesn't have to be cleaned as often or for as 
long to keep it humming, produced a water savings of 60 million gallons in 
fiscal year 1988-89 over the previous year, an 8.9% cutback, said Jack Powazek, 
head of operations at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
But there are limits. "We're not going to tear up all the grassy fields and put 
in concrete," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Powazek said the university's continuing conservation efforts include the 
installation of low-flow toilets and showers. Polymer implants, which retain 
150 times their mass in water then sweat out moisture judiciously, are being 
embedded in the lawns around campus. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is in the middle of a 9-year program to replace its iron sprinkler system 
with sturdier synthetic piping that won't leak. Timers have been installed and 
lawn watering is concentrated at night and in the early morning, when less 
evaporation occurs. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already made a major effort to cut the amount of water we are using, and 
we are going to try and cut more," said Powazek. But it's questionable whether 
the Westwood campus will be able to reach the 10% suggested by the city. 
</P>
<P>
It can't be done, university officials said, citing previous stringent water 
conservation measures. "I think it would be irresponsible to say we could hit 
10%," Powazek said. 
</P>
<P>
An even greater stumbling block is the yardstick year by which conservation is 
supposed to be measured -- 1985-86 -- a year that school officials say UCLA's 
water use was abnormally low for reasons neither they nor the DWP can explain. 
</P>
<P>
When the City Council was considering making the cutbacks mandatory with stiff 
penalties, Powazek discussed the issue with Mayor Bradley's water aide, John 
Stodder. Powazek said he proposed using an average of 1987-88 and '88-89 as the 
base amount. 
</P>
<P>
Stodder said that despite the DWP's 1985-86 figures, the city is open to making 
exceptions where justified. "We want to reward them for doing good, not punish 
them for doing good," Stodder said. "I've found out (water conservation) is 
more of an art than a science." When the City Council recently rejected the 
mandatory rationing because voluntary conservation had been so successful, UCLA 
got a reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
From what he has seen of UCLA's self-described efforts, DWP Senior Water 
Engineer Jerry Gehe said the university appears to be taking reasonable steps 
to save water, though overall it is clear the campus is gulping more water each 
year as it expands. 
</P>
<P>
Whether that is environmentally responsible is not the DWP's call, Gehe said, 
but a policy matter for other officials to thrash out. 
</P>
<P>
However, university officials insist they are eager to be good citizens of Los 
Angeles and conserve along with everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
One way to do that, said longtime Westwood resident Wolfgang Veith, is to use 
so-called gray water, or recycled waste water from washing machines, bathtubs, 
sinks and showers, for irrigation. UCLA's irrigation accounts for 16% of its 
water use, Powazek said. Veith said UCLA has the opportunity in its Long-Range 
Development Plan to build in piping systems to recycle water. No such proposals 
were included in the environmental impact report, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the area of innovation, Veith comes close to accord with UCLA's Powazek, who 
predicted that there would be new technology to save water in the next 15 years 
-- perhaps developed at UCLA or another research institution -- if the 
machinery and its operators stay calm, cool and collected and the well doesn't 
run dry.

PASADENA TO CO-OWN HAWKEY'S NEW HOME

PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city will invest $377,500 to become majority owner of City Manager Philip 
Hawkey's new $615,000 home on the East Arroyo. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey will provide $50,000 of his own money and secure a loan for $187,500 to 
complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The equity participation agreement was approved Tuesday by the Board of 
Directors as part of the housing assistance specified under the city's contract 
with the former Toledo, Ohio, city manager, who began work in Pasadena on June 
18. 
</P>
<P>
Director Chris Holden voted against the investment and Director Bill Paparian 
was absent. 
</P>
<P>
"The city investment is considerably high as I see it," Holden said, adding 
that he had seen ads for comparable houses for $479,000 and $439,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Director Rick Cole, who along with Holden had opposed Hawkey's selection, 
said the time had passed to oppose the assistance. He said the board had agreed 
to provide assistance without mention of a specific dollar amount. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey's selection in April over two black candidates generated a 4-3 split on 
the board and opposition from many minority residents. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,975-square-foot traditional home on Wotkyns Drive was built in 1931. 
Hawkey said he picked the house after looking at nearly 70 homes and 
negotiating the price down from $688,000. Surrounding homes are more expensive, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena home is a step down from the 5,400-square-foot home that he owned 
in Toledo, Hawkey said. But, he added, that residence sold for only $145,000, 
providing him with $30,000 worth of equity toward a $50,000 down payment in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $20,000 down payment will come from personal means, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey said that his monthly payments will amount to about $3,000. City Atty. 
Victor Kaleta said the arrangement places the city at little risk. In the event 
Hawkey defaults on his $187,500 loan, ends employment with the city or sells 
the home, the city would receive its investment back, plus any profits based on 
its percentage of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey is the second top-ranking city employee to receive housing assistance 
this year. In March, the board approved a $45,000 loan to help City Clerk 
Marvell Herren buy a $305,000 home in the San Rafael Hills. 
</P>
<P>
By providing the assistance, Pasadena joins a growing number of cities 
statewide that are pitching in to help their top employees with housing. 
</P>
<P>
Such help includes low-interest loans from the city, aid in obtaining mortgages 
from outside lenders, housing allowances and contributions toward down 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
City Director John Crowley said Tuesday that Caltech has been providing equity 
participation arrangements for its top officials for the past 10 years and thus 
such arrangements are not unique.

SUNSET STREET FAIR BRINGS DIVERSE NEIGHBORS TOGETHER 
</P>

The emcee, a young woman sporting chic black sunglasses, surveyed the audience 
that surrounded the music stage Sunday evening on Sunset Boulevard: gay 
couples, youths in punk-rock outfits, Latino families, senior citizens. Then 
she gestured toward the band behind her and laughed brashly. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to get up and dance?" she asked the crowd. "Then just do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Do anything you want to have fun. Sunset Boulevard is yours for the asking." 
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 people took her up on the offer. 
</P>
<P>
After a decade of forging through some rough financial, legal and political 
waters, the Sunset Junction Street Fair finally may have found its groove. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day block party was founded in 1980 to promote understanding between 
gays and Latinos in Silver Lake, Los Feliz and Echo Park. After a low turnout 
in Echo Park last year, the fair resumed its usual setting last weekend along 
seven blocks of Sunset Boulevard between Fountain Avenue and Edgecliffe Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The result, organizers and police agreed, was an unusually peaceful affair 
marked by wildly diverse people, music and revelry. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the site better in Echo Park -- it had the water and the gardens -- 
but we didn't get the crowds," said Manuel Pumphrey, an Echo Park youth group 
counselor who was working at a booth at the fair. "And having it on Sunset 
gives it the true feeling of a street fair." 
</P>
<P>
John Daniel Manzo, 13, and Fernando Saavedra, 11, were two of nearly 100 local 
youths, some of them gang members, who volunteered as monitors at the fair. 
During a break Sunday, the two ate a salary of free pepperoni pizza. But the 
job's best benefit, they said, was the authority to scold adults for drinking 
beer outside designated "beer gardens." 
</P>
<P>
For Isaac (Little Bear) Urquidi and other Urban Indian Council officials, the 
fair was an excellent forum for handing out literature and selling Indian fry 
bread. Other activist groups, ranging from ACT UP/LA to Atheists United to the 
Black Gay and Lesbian Leadership Forum, distributed petitions, buttons and 
condoms. 
</P>
<P>
Fair-goers needing more than food for thought feasted on corn on the cob, Cajun 
chicken, Thai noodles, Greek gyros and burritos offered by dozens of vendors. 
Many ate only after they had enjoyed carnival rides or the laser light show. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a lot of great booths here, a lot of different foods, and you can 
see the latest dances," Tyrone Dunn, a 30-year-old amateur photographer from 
Pasadena, said as he took photos of a makeshift, canvas-covered disco, where 
gay and straight men and women danced. The fair has not always operated so 
smoothly. The 1985 event was marred by brawls. The 1986 fair was canceled 
because insurance costs were too high. And in 1987, organizers filed a $500,000 
discrimination lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles, alleging losses in 
revenue and reputation after police forced them to end a Labor Day weekend 
fund-raising concert a day early. The lawsuit is still pending, according to 
Micheal McKinley of the Sunset Junction Neighborhood Alliance, the main 
organizer of the fair. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, some fair-goers complained about the diversity of the crowd and 
said they preferred the event in Echo Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it this year. I thought there was going to be more kids and more 
entertainment," said Stephanie Basquez, 12, who on Sunday accompanied her 
mother at the fair. "It was better in Echo Park because there weren't that many 
gays and lesbians." 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, visitors, organizers and police seemed pleased with the 
festivity. About 60 officers were dispatched from the Northeast, Rampart and 
Metro police divisions to cover the fair. On Saturday and Sunday, many could be 
found sitting nonchalantly in chairs or on the hoods of their cars, watching 
calm crowds pass by. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said two minor fistfights broke out during the affair but there were 
no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest emergency we've had was a lost parent," one officer said Sunday as 
he monitored a medical tent. "And the biggest problem we've had to contend with 
is the heat." 
</P>
<P>
"It's taken a lot of work to get to this," said John Brown of the Sunset 
Junction Neighborhood Alliance. In 1980, "there were some real fears and 
tension about what was going to happen. But now you've got transvestites, 
transsexuals, people in leather, you've got gay and lesbian couples, senior 
citizens, Latino families. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a blending," Brown said. "It's more of a mosaic. And that's what the 
street fair is all about."

CITY PLANNER OPPOSES SENIORS HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal announced this week to build the largest senior-citizen housing 
development in Glendale immediately stirred opposition when a city planner said 
the proposed project is too big and in the wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
A group of local developers and architects, flanked by senior-citizen advocates 
and representatives of Glendale Memorial Hospital, conducted a press conference 
Monday to announce plans to build a $65-million, 516-unit high-rise apartment 
complex on a triangle of land in south Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The project would house about 700 seniors on a two-acre site bordered by 
Central Avenue, Los Feliz Road and San Fernando Road. The site is next to the 
hospital, which would provide support services and programs, said Hamo 
Rostamian, managing general partner of the developer, Dorn-Platz Investment Co. 
</P>
<P>
The developer and the architect -- Feola Deenihan Archuleta of Glendale -- said 
they expect to seek two variances for the project. One variance would allow the 
project to provide for fewer parking spaces than required and the other would 
allow it to exceed the permitted three-story height limit by 10 stories. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the city will be helpful" in granting the variances and speeding the 
project, Rostamian said. 
</P>
<P>
However, City Planning Director John W. McKenna said a proposal shown to him 
several months ago would require a zoning change and an amendment to the city's 
General Plan -- a lengthy and expensive process. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal that I saw was not in accord with the density, land use or the 
General Plan, in addition to the height limit and parking requirements," 
McKenna said. 
</P>
<P>
A zoning change and General Plan amendment would require four-fifths approval 
of the City Council, whereas variances can be granted by a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said the size and scope of the project make it better suited for a 
different location, such as the downtown redevelopment zone where high-rises 
are permitted or on larger vacant parcels elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I am well aware that there is a need for senior housing in the community -- 
particularly for moderate- and lower-income seniors," McKenna said. "But there 
are other properties that are properly zoned and vacant that would be 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed site now has a carwash, automotive garages and other commercial 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the project, called Crossroads, will be submitted to the city this 
week. The project is to be privately financed and 10% of the units reserved for 
low-income seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Pelletier, housing chairman of the Greater Glendale Council on Aging, 
which served as consultants, endorsed the project. "I don't know of a better 
place to put one in Glendale," he said. "Our group feels it will enhance the 
southern part of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Partners in the project include California Lutheran Homes, specialists in 
retirement homes, which will serve as manager, and Glendale Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Crossroads would provide "a full spectrum of senior living," its advocates say, 
from units that would be occupied by senior citizens capable of living 
independently to housing designed to serve elderly people who need more 
assistance with medication, housekeeping and meals. 
</P>
<P>
Retail space on the ground floor would include shops, medical offices and a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The 480,000-square-foot complex would consist of three buildings -- eight, 10 
and 13 stories -- arranged in a triangle around a plaza. Underground valet 
parking is planned for 440 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
All units would have a living room, kitchen and bathroom. Five 
hundred-square-foot, one-bedroom units are to rent for $895 a month. About 50 
will be set aside for low-income seniors and rented for $450 a month, Rostamian 
said. Two-bedroom units are to cost $1,145 a month.

DAIL-A-RIDE PACT AWARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to award a $309,734, 11-month 
contract to ATE/RYDER to operate the city's Dial-A-Ride program for elderly and 
disabled residents. 
</P>
<P>
A three-month contract beginning July 1 was given to ATE/RYDER last month when 
the city discovered that the previous contractor, Mid-Valley Transit Inc., was 
not properly insured. 
</P>
<P>
ATE/RYDER also operates the city's old-fashioned trolley system. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than put the contract out to bid after three months, Parks and 
Recreation Director Brian Ogden recommended that the city continue with the El 
Monte-based ATE/RYDER, which he said is a proven provider. Mid-Valley Transit's 
yearlong contract was for $205,000, but Ogden said start-up costs and two new 
station wagons that ATE/RYDER plans to buy account for the higher price.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: WE NAMED THE PUMP WILLY WEEPUL WATER WASTER. HE KEEPS US 
AT A HAPPY 75. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For several weeks, life has been grim in the three-story gold-brick Italianate 
landmark at the corner of Harvard Street and Brand Boulevard, where The Times 
rents space. 
</P>
<P>
From the outside, you'd never have guessed it, but inside it's been hot, muggy 
and stale. In the heat wave last month, the air-conditioning unit for the 
second floor collapsed from exhaustion, and it took a harried repairman a week 
to get it working. 
</P>
<P>
Then it utterly died three weeks ago, just before I left on vacation. On 
returning last Monday, I had two important news items awaiting me. 
</P>
<P>
The first came from the thermometer, which told me that the air-conditioning 
hadn't been repaired. It read 80 on the cool side of the room. As the day 
progressed, it hit the top of the scale at 95 as the sun radiated heat through 
the large west windows, which were sealed, of course, to keep cool air in. 
</P>
<P>
The other piece of information was more promising. It came in a letter from 
Dorn-Platz &amp; Co., Realtors, informing us that our building had a new owner, 
B. K. (Bill) Holderness, a developer who has bought up many an old Glendale 
building for rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
The letter introduced Marsha MacPherson, Property Management Division, as his 
agent: 
</P>
<P>
"If we can help you in any way," she wrote, "please do not hesitate to call on 
us." 
</P>
<P>
I did not hesitate to call. MacPherson was not available. A woman named Carol, 
who took the call, said the new management was working on the problem. She said 
the same on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had four men working most of the day," she said. "They informed me that 
they have it running." 
</P>
<P>
I put little faith in that. Air-conditioning men are evasive by constitution. 
</P>
<P>
For the past few years, our air-conditioning unit has broken down at the 
beginning of every summer and always runs either too hot or too cold. When you 
ask an air-conditioning man what's wrong, he will look at the wall behind your 
shoulder, mumble something metaphysical about the interrelatedness of all 
things and then poke into a duct with a screwdriver drawn from a holster at his 
side. Nothing ever changes. 
</P>
<P>
To my not-very-veiled skepticism, Carol replied that if I still wasn't 
satisfied, I could put my complaints in writing. 
</P>
<P>
That's an opening you don't give to a reporter. In the peak of discomfort, I 
composed a caustic recitation of the facts. I allowed them one more day to come 
through. They didn't, of course, but something else caused me to change my 
tune. The next day, Times management took the matter into its own hands. 
</P>
<P>
That's when I met Chuck, an air-conditioning man whose can-do attitude I 
admired. His company, he boasted, had once air conditioned an asphalt parking 
lot on a summer day. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck said he'd get us a heat pump. That's a machine that pumps heat right out 
of a room. It's about five feet tall and two feet square. He suggested we move 
the table where we usually read the day's newspapers. We'd have done anything. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck and his helper, Tim, spent most of a day running a thick black power line 
halfway across the building to the breaker box and two one-inch red rubber 
hoses to the sink in the storage room. Chuck took pride in securing them neatly 
up the wall and through the drop ceiling. It was a clean job. 
</P>
<P>
When he was ready to turn it on, he briefed me on the water. A heat pump, you 
see, pumps heat away by putting it into water. The water can't be allowed to 
get above 120 degrees, or the motor will draw too much electricity and stop. 
</P>
<P>
To maintain that temperature, the water has to run at about three gallons per 
minute. Usually, Chuck said, the water would be pumped into a cooling tower and 
recirculated. 
</P>
<P>
But we didn't have access to a cooling tower, so it had to go down the drain. 
Chuck had installed a new cold-water pipe through the wall to supply the water. 
He also cleared our drain with CO2 to make sure that it wouldn't overflow. It 
was a really clean job. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't help showing my distress. At that moment, I had a letter on my desk 
from the city of Glendale, asking my help in cutting commercial water use by 
10%. The city had a chart showing the waste a tiny drip can cause and even 
created a conservation mascot called the Weepul, a yellow fuzz ball with feet. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck understood the expression of self-reproach that crossed my face. He knew 
what to say. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a cooling tower, some water would evaporate and more would have to be 
drawn off to prevent scale. Hundreds of thousands of gallons of water a day are 
used to cool downtown Los Angeles, he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Old air conditioners, like ours, simply blow the heat into the atmosphere. But 
they're being phased out, Chuck said, because they're bad for the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
He pulled a large hand switch. Our office roared like the inside of a cold 
storage locker. We'll endure it. 
</P>
<P>
We named the pump Willy Weepul Water Waster. He keeps us at a happy 75 and, 
like a good reporter, he's ruthlessly honest. 
</P>
<P>
He's constantly reminding that it takes 1,440 gallons of water to keep five 
people cool for eight hours. But not for long, we hope. 
</P>
<P>
They've been working on the old unit. They say it's running. We'll see.

CITY CHARGES VAN OPERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn has filed a 134-count criminal complaint against the 
operator of a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport for what he called 
its "stunning indifference" to safety problems in its airport shuttle fleet. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Trusthouse Forte Inc. and company President Barry Lee 
Conrad stem from the firm's failure to adequately maintain its fleet of shuttle 
buses at the Viscount Hotel, at 9750 Airport Blvd., Hahn charged this week. 
</P>
<P>
Trusthouse Forte operates the hotel and runs its airport shuttle service, Hahn 
said. Conrad and other company officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The fleet has flunked four consecutive safety inspections since last August, 
mostly on violations of the California Vehicle Safety Code, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Asha Saund, who is handling the case, said the vehicles were 
often in such bad condition that authorities ordered them removed from service 
due to "imminently hazardous mechanical defects," including emergency exit 
windows that were screwed shut, defective exhaust systems underneath passenger 
areas, and loose bolts securing passenger seats to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Arraignment in the case is set for Aug. 2 in West Los Angeles Municipal Court.

MORE MONEY FOR AID FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Directors on Tuesday approved providing additional money for D. M. 
Griffith &amp; Associates Ltd. to continue seeking $367,236 owed the city in 
state and federal disaster funds from the 1987 Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The Carmichael-based company specializes in helping cities and counties recover 
losses from disasters once emergency aid has been granted by state and federal 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
The company was initially paid $20,000 from Pasadena for its work and will 
receive an additional $28,000 under the increase approved Tuesday.

WATER-SAVING PLAN ADOPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday adopted a three-phase water conservation plan, 
effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
In the first, voluntary phase, residents are urged to follow a number of 
water-saving measures. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase makes those measures mandatory. The third is a rationing 
phase, which requires that residents cut water use by a percentage based on the 
severity of the drought. 
</P>
<P>
Water-saving measures include not hosing sidewalks and driveways, not serving 
drinking water in public places, watering lawns only during the evening and 
night, repairing leaky faucets and sprinkler systems, and not filling swimming 
pools, spas and hot tubs. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Terry L. James said the city is in the first phase and 
will proceed to the mandatory phase if the water table in the San Gabriel Basin 
doesn't rise by September or October.

SUMMER FESTIVAL IDEA OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed Old Pasadena Summer Festival, to be held all day Aug. 25, was 
approved in concept Tuesday by the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members were told to work with festival promoters from the American 
Cancer Society, the Old Pasadena Business and Professional Assn. and The 
Sycamores, a residential treatment center in Altadena for abused, abandoned and 
emotionally disturbed children. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the festival include closing Colorado Boulevard from Pasadena Avenue 
to Arroyo Parkway from 7:30 a.m. to midnight. Events would include an "Un-Run," 
a fund-raiser in which participants sign up to have Breakfast on the Boulevard 
instead of running a 10-kilometer race. Also planned are "Dancing on the 
Boulevard,"' an art show and other entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds would be donated to the American Cancer Society and The Sycamores. 
Cost to the city for police, street cleaning and other services would be 
$6,168.

CITY ATTORNEY SELECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malibu voters can meet the fledgling city's first staff member -- and so far 
its only one -- at 7:30 tonight when Michael Jenkins, the city attorney, 
appears before the City Council-elect. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member council announced Jenkins' hiring Monday, the same day a 
California appeals court ruled that Los Angeles County can delay Malibu's 
official incorporation until next year. 
</P>
<P>
"My first order of business for Malibu is to review the court's decision with 
the council to see what action to take," said Jenkins. "After that we'll look 
at a long list of start-up problems for this special city." 
</P>
<P>
Hiring legal counsel to guide it through a maze of lawsuits and other problems 
has been a priority for the council-elect, even though the proposed city has no 
money. "Basically I'm operating on good faith with the council," said Jenkins, 
"but this isn't unusual with a new community." Once Malibu incorporates, tax 
dollars will flow into the city treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins is affiliated with the Los Angeles firm of Richards, Watson and 
Gershon, which specializes in municipal law and represents about 18 Southern 
California communities. "It's a premier firm," said Malibu attorney Barry 
Haldeman, who chaired the search committee. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins has a law degree from Duke University and is president-elect of the Los 
Angeles County City Attorneys' Assn. He is also on the faculty of USC Law 
School.

ANTI-GRAFFITI PACT RENEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday renewed its contract with the El Monte Boys' Club 
for graffiti removal for another year at a cost of $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Boys' Club, a nonprofit youth organization, has provided the service for 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, a 10-member crew responds seven days a week to calls from 
police, homeowners and businesses to remove graffiti from walls, signs, poles, 
and curbs. 
</P>
<P>
The city is charged $25 per site, up to a maximum of $6,000 a month, said 
Clayton Hollopeter, executive director of the Boys' Club. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the Boys' Club's efforts, West Covina remains virtually 
graffiti-free, said Mike Miller, an official in the city's community services 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Under its contract with West Covina, the club provides a three-member staff to 
counsel youths on probation. It also has graffiti-removal contracts with San 
Dimas, Claremont and Diamond Bar.

The City Council has temporarily prohibited second-story additions to 
single-family homes while the Planning Department finishes a study on such 
additions. 
</P>
<P>
The urgency ordinance prohibiting additions was approved unanimously Tuesday 
night. Ed Cox, director of community development, said the department is not 
considering prohibiting second-story additions, but rather wants to find better 
ways of building them so they do not harm adjacent properties. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said a report is tentatively scheduled to be presented to the Planning 
Commission Aug. 20. It could then come back to the council for consideration by 
Sept. 25.

FEE FOR PROCESSING PETITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Processing initiative petitions will cost $50 under a resolution adopted by the 
City Council to discourage frivolous petitions. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved Tuesday night, says the fee will be refunded if the 
city clerk certifies within a year that the petition has been filed. 
</P>
<P>
Council members John Hitt and James Kirchner, who voted against the measure, 
said the fee would infringe on the democratic process by putting a heavier 
burden on the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the council, however, said a fee would deter those who, for 
example, process several petitions and file none, causing city staff wasted 
time and effort.

A contested proposal for a swap-meet-style store in Northwest Pasadena -- cited 
by proponents as yet another example of strained relations between 
African-Americans and Korean-Americans -- stymied the Board of Directors on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After more than three hours of discussion in chambers filled with blacks and 
Koreans, the board, sitting as the Community Redevelopment Commission, 
postponed for a week a decision on the proposed Fair Oaks Department Store. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement allows the board time to tour the site of the proposed store 
at 625 N. Fair Oaks Ave. in the Fair Oaks/Orange Grove shopping center.

It also allows the board time to study a number of complicated legal questions 
arising from the project and from a lawsuit filed in May against the city by 
the store's applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Harris, one of three partners in the proposed store, said Tuesday that 
he expects the board to return in a week and, following the lead of two city 
committees, vote against the project. Pasadena officials oppose the store, not 
because of legal objections, Harris contended, but because his two partners are 
Koreans. Harris is black. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to see blacks; they don't want to see a shop with a bunch of Koreans 
in there," Harris said of city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, about 50 Koreans and other supporters of the store picketed 
outside City Hall, claiming that city staff and two citizens committees have 
blocked the store's opening because of racism. 
</P>
<P>
But Jim Hall, chairman of the Fair Oaks Project Area Committee, a group 
overseeing redevelopment in that part of Northwest Pasadena, denied that race 
or ethnicity has affected his committee's opposition or that of the Community 
Development Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary issue is whether this use is consistent with the (Fair Oaks) 
redevelopment plan and with good redevelopment," Hall said. "A swap meet will 
have a strong negative impact on the redevelopment area and Northwest Pasadena 
in general." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed store would convert a 20,000-square-foot, former Thrifty Drug 
Store into stalls for 38 vendors who would rent space monthly. Korean 
businessman Paul Cho, one of Harris' partners, has for four years operated a 
similar store in Inglewood called the Inglewood Department Store. 
</P>
<P>
A similar Korean-run business called the L.A. Slauson Swapmeet operates in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In a phenomenon that has been occurring nationally, both the Inglewood and Los 
Angeles stores have been criticized by black community activists for alleged 
insensitivity toward black customers. 
</P>
<P>
Awareness of the strained relations between African-Americans and 
Korean-Americans reached a peak earlier this year when blacks in the Flatbush 
area of Brooklyn began picketing outside Korean grocery stores to protest the 
alleged beating of a Haitian customer and what they called ongoing 
disrespectful treatment of black customers by Korean merchants. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute garnered national attention, especially since it seemed to mirror 
strained Korean and black relations portrayed in Spike Lee's 1989 movie, "Do 
the Right Thing." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, similar accusations have been leveled in other urban areas 
nationwide. A Los Angeles group calling itself OMNI, the Organization of Mutual 
Neighborhood Interest, picketed both the Inglewood and Slauson stores last 
December over such concerns. 
</P>
<P>
But Harris, whose public relations company represents Cho's Inglewood store, 
said the pickets were outsiders unfamiliar with the scholarships and food 
donations made by Cho to the Inglewood community. 
</P>
<P>
Cho intends to duplicate his commitment to community service in Pasadena, 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
However, plans for Cho's Pasadena store have foundered because the store is 
inside the redevelopment area. Before building permits can be issued for 
projects in the area, they must be reviewed by the Fair Oaks Project Area 
Committee and the Community Development Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In Cho's case, city officials mistakenly issued building permits in February 
and March, then in April retroactively put a hold on the project and told Cho 
that the proposed store needed to be considered by the two committees. 
</P>
<P>
Cho responded by filing a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court, arguing that 
the two committees had no authority to intervene in the issuance of a simple 
building permit. Both committees subsequently denied approval for the store, 
citing concern over lack of sufficient parking for the store and fears that the 
store's lower-priced vendors would drive neighborhood shops out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Cho's lawsuit is still pending. A scheduled Aug. 8 court hearing on it will 
probably be rescheduled because of the board's postponement of a decision 
Tuesday, lawyers involved in the case said. 
</P>
<P>
During the board meeting, Cho's attorney, Douglas Ring, accused the city of 
"selective enforcement," saying that no other project in the Fair Oaks area had 
been singled out for consideration by the two committees. 
</P>
<P>
Ring also argued that the proposed store would operate more like a department 
store than a swap meet, which opens temporarily for only 48 hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some neighborhood residents remained opposed to the store, saying it 
would not upgrade the area and would increase crime by encouraging loiterers to 
gather inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
"The community here is very worried," said resident Stephen Mack. 'We cleaned 
up the place and ran the drunkards off, and now are you going to turn around 
and convert it back to the same thing we got rid of?' " 
</P>
<P>
City directors also expressed concern that the store failed to meet a 
redevelopment goal of providing jobs to local residents. The board asked for 
city staff to return in a week with, among other things, a legal opinion on 
whether the city can require such a goal as a condition of approval.

FUNDS OKD FOR FLYERS ON AMNESTY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Council voted 4 to 1 this week to spend almost $26,000 to print 
and mail 33,000 flyers announcing an amnesty program for Zoning and Building 
Code violators. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of properties with illegal structures, room additions and garage 
conversions will be given until Nov. 13 to report their violations and qualify 
for amnesty, according to the flyer. 
</P>
<P>
Under the amnesty program, they will be exempt from fines and penalties and 
will not be required to correct the violations until the property is sold and 
title transferred. 
</P>
<P>
Health and Safety Code violations, however, although exempt from fines and 
penalties under the amnesty program, must be brought up to code immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Building and zoning violators who do not file for amnesty and are later caught 
will be given six months to a year to bring their property into compliance with 
the law, according to the pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jim Boulgarides, who favors stricter enforcement of the codes, voted 
against the measure at the council's Monday night meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The council in February approved a program to crackdown on "bootleg" apartments 
and other illegal conversions, which city officials said are causing traffic 
problems in residential neighborhoods and benefiting from city services without 
paying taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The council adopted the present amnesty program in May after homeowners 
complained that the crackdown would penalize them for violations they did not 
know about when they bought the property. 
</P>
<P>
Residents with questions about potential violations can call (213) 280-5944. 
Complaints will be kept confidential and anonymity will be respected for 
callers inquiring about their own properties, according to the flyer. 
</P>
<P>
The funds approved Monday also include about $8,000 to buy advertisements 
announcing the amnesty program in local newspapers.

3 WATER AGENCIES AIM AT JOINT CLEANUP; ACTIVISTS PROTEST PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what environmentalists have called "the fight for the hearts, minds and 
faucets of the San Gabriel Valley," the longstanding struggle over who will 
oversee the complicated and expensive cleanup of polluted ground water could 
take a new twist next week. 
</P>
<P>
Federal environmental officials have acknowledged that no single government 
entity has overall authority to supervise and finance the regional cleanup 
efforts. Responding to this void, a local water agency and two of the region's 
key water districts have decided to band together to try to take over the 
leading cleanup role. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the local water agency -- known as the Main San Gabriel Basin 
Watermaster -- will ask a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to give it expanded 
authority in controlling how and where the region's water is pumped by water 
companies. Such control, the Watermaster and the water districts contend, would 
be a crucial step in remedying the pollution problem. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a method that will work," said Reginald Stone, vice chairman of the 
Watermaster, which oversees water pumping rights. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists oppose the plan, saying they fear that giving such control to 
the Watermaster could shut out public participation in the cleanup effort and 
adversely affect 1 million water consumers from Alhambra to La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists, as well as politicians such as Rep. Esteban E. Torres 
(D-La Puente) and Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park), say a new 
regional super-agency, accountable to the public, should be created through 
state legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid if (the Watermaster and the water districts) get control of the 
cleanup, it won't be very efficient," said Maxine Leichter, head of the water 
quality group for the 50,000-member Angeles chapter of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
Leichter and other environmentalists say they are concerned that the 
Watermaster and water districts have a conflict of interest in the cleanup 
effort because they are in the business of making money from pumping and 
selling water. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Basin, source of drinking water for most of the San Gabriel 
Valley, suffers from one of the West's most severe underground pollution 
problems. The contamination was caused largely by solvents and degreasing 
agents, used since World War II by large industries and small businesses such 
as dry cleaning establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Although the basin was placed in 1984 on the federal list of Superfund sites of 
the nation's worst environmental disasters, little actual cleanup has occurred. 
This has frustrated environmentalists, politicians, water consumers and local 
water agencies alike. 
</P>
<P>
By having more authority over how the more than 50 water companies and water 
districts pump water, Watermaster officials say, they can oversee installation 
of pollution treatment facilities and monitor more closely the pumping of 
water. The pumping influences movement of large underground plumes, or 
clusters, of contamination in the San Gabriel Valley. With more power, the 
water officials say, they will be able to quickly implement an effective 
treatment plan for the pollution, discovered in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Boards of two of the three key water districts, Three Valleys Municipal Water 
District and the San Gabriel Valley Water District, each voted earlier this 
month to form an alliance to work with the Watermaster in solving the pollution 
problem. The third board, of Upper San Gabriel Valley Water District, is 
scheduled to vote Friday on whether to join in. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club last week and the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
both have filed briefs arguing against the Watermaster's plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The waters would be very much muddied, if the Watermaster were granted 
additional powers," said Jan Chatten-Brown, who serves as Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner's special assistant on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
The action proposed by the Watermaster has its appeal, said Bill Van Buskirk of 
the environmental group known as SWIG (Superfund Working/Information Group). 
But, he said, "Our position is relatively rigid in wanting an independent 
agency." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Berlien, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel district, counters 
that it would take too much time to create a super-agency as advocated by 
environmentalists. This would require state legislation that could take several 
years, he said. "In the meantime, nothing gets accomplished," Berlien said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to follow recommendations of the state water board," Berlien 
said, "and get the cleanup under way." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of their differences, environmentalists, politicians and water 
district representatives have formed a task force on the issue and are 
scheduled to meet tonight to discuss the cleanup, estimated to cost between 
$850 million and $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state environmental officials in April presented a proposal for how 
the water contamination should be remedied. But both state and federal 
officials say it is up to local and regional officials to come up with the 
means of ridding the basin of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Next Thursday, the State Water Resources Control Board in Sacramento will 
review what progress San Gabriel water agencies have made in resolving how they 
will approach the cleanup.

'HOOTS' LIVE ON;

MUSICIANS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY ARE PICKING AND STRUMMING TO KEEP A GRASS-ROOTS

Does much of today's rock 'n' roll make you reel? Do you find yourself tearing 
up when you hear a refrain of "Puff, the Magic Dragon?" Fear not, there is an 
antidote for what ails you. Folk music is alive in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Although this grass-roots music enjoys a popular resurgence from time to time, 
it has always had a faithful following and folk musicians will keep on picking 
and strumming no matter what comes and goes on the hit charts. 
</P>
<P>
Folk music itself represents the creative expression of people worldwide. But 
what is typically thought of as American folk music comes from many ethnic 
influences including black gospel, Irish working and drinking songs and 
Appalachian love ballads. While the omnipresent guitar has become the symbol of 
folk music, the banjo, fiddle, mandolin, harp, autoharp and dulcimer are also 
used extensively. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura folk scene offers plenty of opportunities for those who enjoy 
participating as well as those who don't. Hootenannies, or "Hoots" for short, 
are essentially sing-alongs and are held several times a week in the homes of 
various enthusiasts who call themselves the Songmakers. 
</P>
<P>
The group has been meeting continuously since it first got together in the '40s 
as a way for songwriters to share their material with their fellow composers. 
Their most famous member has been American folk singer Pete Seeger, member 
Jackie Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The Songmakers, which boasts 300 paid members, has grown to include those who 
enjoy singing and playing as well as writing folk music. On any given evening, 
20 to 30 musicians gather to listen to one anothers original compositions or 
interpretations of more traditional melodies. All instruments and levels of 
ability are welcome, both professional and amateur, said Smith, as the emphasis 
is on fun. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura chapter meets in Simi Valley every Wednesday as well as the third 
Friday of each month. Call (805) 527-7340 for more information. There is no 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Several cities in the county also offer Friday night concerts for those who 
prefer to sit back rather than sing along. The oldest in the series is a 
"coffeehouse" in Thousand Oaks, which is held the first Friday of each month. 
Now in its 10th year, this event draws both local and out-of-the-area 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
This month, Paul Sanchez and Rabbit MacKay, two Ventura County residents, 
performed a combination of folk, blues, country, rock and original music. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 3, Mickey Bochard, a mother-and-daughter contemporary gospel duo are 
scheduled to perform. Call (805) 499-4355, the Arts Council of the Conejo 
Valley, for more information on the August concert. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the many musicians who wanted another showcase for their 
talents, Newbury Park started its own series of concerts called Fireside 
Offerings, said Dawn Kuznkowski, program organizer and musician. Now, five 
years later, 100 folk music lovers gather in a cozy nook of the Borchard 
Community Center on the second Friday of each month to hear anything from 
foot-stomping bluegrass fiddles to twanging Hawaiian ukuleles. 
</P>
<P>
The center attracts everything from semiprofessional performers to amateurs, 
with the only restriction being that all performers play acoustic instruments. 
</P>
<P>
This month's offerings included a balladeer from the Santa Cruz area, Mark 
Levy, who performed original political satire/protest songs, followed by mother 
and daughter, Mary and Dana Crooks, who sang haunting Appalachian harmonies, 
and continuing with local musicians Jim St. Ours, Paul Sanchez and Glenn 
Scrivner, who played a variety of traditional ballads. They are also preparing 
to perform at the county fair later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The next concert will be Aug. 10. The performance, like all Fireside Offerings, 
is a surprise for the audience, said Kuznkowski, since the evening agenda isn't 
set until right before concert time. For more information, call (805) 498-3124 
or 495-5118. A $2 donation is requested and refreshments are served. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo is the latest community to catch the folk vision, and has been 
hosting a third-Friday-of-the-month "Camarillo Cafe" at the "O" Club at the 
Camarillo Airport for the past year. It goes from 8 p.m. to 12 a.m., event 
coordinator Jack Zigray said. 
</P>
<P>
The cafe has been around for nearly a year and offers an eclectic mix of 
acoustic music, from traditional folk and blues to classical and even some rock 
'n' roll (of course, without amplifiers). 
</P>
<P>
At the July show, Harvey Taylor played blues and ragtime acoustic guitar, 
Barbara Brussels sang show tunes, guitarist and singer Elyna Le Fevre performed 
traditional folk songs, followed by acoustic duo Jerry Faigin and Linda Marie. 
</P>
<P>
For information on the August show, call (805) 482-1996, 482-0978 or 482-0986. 
Concerts sponsored by Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District are free and 
refreshments are served. 
</P>
<P>
No attempt at covering folk music in the county would be complete without 
mentioning two popular groups who perform regularly. The Old Time Fiddlers 
Assn., a group of 30 or more, get together on the second and fourth Sundays of 
each month at the Community Center in Oak View to play their old favorites. 
Families bring blankets and picnics. A snack bar is also available. The event 
is free. Call (805) 486-8744 or 646-1583 for details. 
</P>
<P>
Another group is the Acousticats. Until recently, they called themselves The 
Phil Salazar Band and played predominantly bluegrass. According to Kim Louks, 
wife of the band's leader, the five-member group has had a change of style. 
They now characterize their music as "new acoustic," which is "progressive with 
traditional folk and jazz influences." 
</P>
<P>
The Acousticats will play at Henson's Music Festival in Camarillo on Aug. 11. 
Call (805) 482-6115 for details.

Sushi Marina is the least Japanese-looking Japanese restaurant I've ever been 
in. Outside it's a beige stucco bunker; inside, the restaurant is covered with 
shingles -- even the awning over the sushi bar has been shingled. Add some 
skylights and hanging plants, and you have a place that could pass for a hip 
California bar, '60s style. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the week, the restaurant had the bouncy atmosphere of a 
Friday-night happy hour. Waitresses in tank tops and butcher aprons zipped 
around at top speed. And although we had to wipe crumbs off our seats, we soon 
got caught up in the pleasant rhythm of the place. 
</P>
<P>
Miso soup, hot and hearty, appears at the table along with the menus. Listed 
are the kinds of Japanese dishes even unsophisticated American palates would 
like -- certainly they are dishes kids would love. 
</P>
<P>
I was delighted with the soft-shelled crab. It arrived with a sprinkling of 
dried bonita that sat tangled on the hot shell like Medusa's hair. The crab 
legs were crisp, crunchy and delicate. And the center was extra tender. The 
crab came with a lemon sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The salmon-skin salad, which consisted mostly of cucumbers and a tiny shred of 
salmon skin, was a disappointment at $5. But the seaweed salad at half that 
price was quite nice. The seaweed was lightly pickled and served on a mound of 
crisp lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
Tempura made a grand entrance on a huge platter. The vegetables were outsize, 
too. The onions seemed as big around as saucers. The batter was crisp and 
somewhat sticky. It tasted good at first, but ultimately became too greasy -- 
it's best to eat fast. 
</P>
<P>
Teriyaki beef was as good as it gets, mainly because of the fine flavor of the 
beef. Beef sukiyaki was also satisfying, essentially a sweet onion soup with 
thin slices of beef, rice and glass noodles. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, with a name like Sushi Marina, the sushi shouldn't take a back seat 
to the rest of the menu. It doesn't. When I eat sushi I order tuna first and 
see if I like the color. Here it was just the right shade of rose pink and as 
tender as butter. 
</P>
<P>
The sushi rolls had wonderful sunflower sprouts that made a plateful of them 
look like a lush little garden. There were a few rolls here I had never before 
tried. The Alaska roll was similar to a California roll but made with cooked 
salmon instead of crab. I found I liked Alaska better than California. I can't 
imagine what they would make of the Philly roll in Tokyo -- it's an Alaska roll 
with cream cheese -- but the flavor of the sesame seeds and the salmon 
certainly brought lox and bagels to my mind. 
</P>
<P>
Two other remarkable rolls were the sunset dragon roll (sea eel with an amazing 
outer wrapping of perfectly textured avocado slices) and the rainbow roll, 
eight kinds of fish wrapped around a California roll -- definitely one to 
share. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: Sushi Marina, 120 S. California St., Ventura; (805) 643-5200. 
Lunch Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.-2 p.m.; dinner Monday through Sunday 
5:30-10 p.m. Sake, wine and beer. Street parking. MasterCard, Visa. Dinner for 
two, food only, $22-$62.50.

The following are some capsule reviews of the better restaurants recently 
visited by our critics: 
</P>
<P>
It's not back in Texas or Tennessee, but off the highway going into Saticoy 
that Buster's Original Bar-B-Q and Bakery sits, dishing out down-home style 
ribs, chicken and the house specialty -- the best tri-tip sandwich between San 
Diego and the Oregon border. The line in front of the outdoor grill goes into 
the parking lot, and the baked goods can be tasty or just so-so, but Buster's 
brings an authentic bit of barbecue to Ventura County. Buster's is located at 
1201 S. Wells Road, Saticoy, 647-2103. Open Tuesday-Friday, 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., 
Saturday-Sunday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Meal for two, food only, $10-$20. 
</P>
<P>
Heard of Mariscos Miguel? Not many people have, and it's a shame. Owner Miguel 
Gonzales serves some wonderful Mexican dishes, particularly the seafood, in 
this former coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the appetizers can make great light lunches. The tostadas de ceviche 
consist of pieces of fish marinated in citrus juice, with chunks of tomato, 
cilantro and cabbage. And for one quesadilla dish, shrimp are sauteed in onions 
and herbs and tucked into corn tortillas and fried. 
</P>
<P>
As for entrees, there are the traditional tamales, chiles rellenos and 
enchiladas, but it's the seafood dishes that stand out. Pescado alla Gonzales 
is fresh halibut sauteed with tiny shrimp and served in a lemony salsa de una 
butter. The mahi-mahi is served crisp on one side, tender on the other, with a 
cilantro-butter sauce, homemade tomato salsa and a delicious fruit salsa. 
</P>
<P>
For breakfast, there is a choice of American dishes -- pancakes, French toast, 
omelets -- or Mexican dishes. The chile verde omelet is filled with cheese and 
covered with a green chili sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Mariscos Miguel is at 1812 Cliff Drive, Unit C, Santa Barbara, 687-7783. 
Breakfast and lunch are served 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday to Saturday; 8 a.m. to 2 
p.m. Sunday. Dinner is served 5 to 9 p.m. Wednesday to Monday. Dinner for two, 
food only, will cost $11 to $32. 
</P>
<P>
Start with a house salad. That's the easiest way to initiate the palate into 
the Turkish and Mediterranean dishes served by Abraham Aymelek, the owner-chef 
of Moonangel. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, why not start with several house salads? A sampler features tastes of 
five selections, highlighted by the patlican salatasi -- an eggplant dish that 
is mousse-like in texture -- and the sweet and tart grape leaves stuffed with 
rice. The borek, or spinach pie, is pretty tempting too. 
</P>
<P>
Following that introduction, move on to the main course. One of the traditional 
Turkish menu items is mantarli kuzu, a lamb and mushroom stew. The list of 
Mediterranean dishes is topped by the poached seafood wrapped in paper and 
steamed in a wine-based, seasoned broth. 
</P>
<P>
Moonangel is located at 302 W. Montecito St., Santa Barbara, 962-8949. Lunch is 
served 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday, dinner 5:30 to 11 p.m. 
daily and brunch 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Sunday. Buffet lunch for two, food 
only, will cost $15. Dinner for two, food only, will cost $32 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
Neon beer signs and colored lights make Golden China restaurant look like a 
pizza parlor. But that's where the similarity ends. The two large dining rooms 
with carved wood panels, Oriental chairs and lantern light fixtures are a dead 
giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
So are the 113 Mandarin and Sichuan items on the menu, most of which are rich 
with garlic and ginger, and some very sweet. 
</P>
<P>
The mixed appetizers are served on a wooden platter with a fire pot burning in 
the middle. The resulting glow over the table is nice, as is the teriyaki beef 
on a stick. 
</P>
<P>
Golden China is located at 1105 S. Seaward Ave., Ventura, 652-0688. Lunch and 
dinner are served 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Dinner for two, food only, $20 
to $44.

<P>
Can a gumshoe learn the soft shoe? Can a deep-dyed lawman lighten up and make 
you laugh? 
</P>
<P>
Braden McKinley, chief investigator for the Ventura County district attorney, 
submitted to questioning on the subject this week. His debut in musical comedy 
was central to the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
McKinley is cast in the role of Hucklebee -- a slightly inept patriarchal type 
-- in "The Fantasticks," which is playing this week at the Ventura College 
Theatre. He was a little surprised, he said, to have landed the part. 
</P>
<P>
"I am probably the least talented of any of the crew. Maybe I have more 
real-life theatrics," the investigator said. "I've probably been doing it all 
my life -- I just didn't realize it." 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of a century in law enforcement may seem incompatible with song and 
dance -- but then, McKinley isn't a typical cop. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to overseeing a staff of 36 detectives, he is an ordained deacon of 
the Catholic church, where, among other duties, he performs marriages and 
teaches catechism. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't raised as a Catholic. It's something he discovered during an 
introspective six years with the sheriff's homicide bureau. The work, which 
perhaps has more often caused people to lose faith than gain it, affected him a 
little differently than some of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"There had to be more to life," he said "than what I saw on the autopsy table." 
</P>
<P>
McKinley, now 47, came from coal mining country -- Franklin, Pa. Just out of 
high school he went into the Navy, where he learned to repair Diesel engines. 
When his tour was up in 1965, he came to California to work in the defense 
industry. He had already married his high school sweetheart, Nancy, and their 
first son was a few months old. 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, when he arrived he found the Omnibus Crime Bill had just been 
signed, pouring federal dollars into police budgets. All the jobs offered 
seemed to be behind a badge. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not really sure I was suited for law enforcement," McKinley said, "I was 
very much an introvert." 
</P>
<P>
But he made up his mind to do it, undaunted by the police recruiter who was 
behind a desk after losing an eye and an ear in a hatchet attack. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later the lawman didn't hesitate to become the first non-military 
bomb technician in the Ventura-Santa Barbara-San Luis Obispo area. (He trained 
at the Army's Redstone Arsenal in Alabama, and eventually was appointed 
commander of the sheriff's bomb team, a post he held for 15 years.) 
</P>
<P>
And the fact that he had no expertise in riding didn't stop McKinley from 
volunteering to develop and train the mounted sheriff's patrol, which is still 
used for crowd control. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to be a Western sheriff on horseback," McKinley said. 
</P>
<P>
It's a little like his decision to break into theater with only a semester of 
acting under his belt. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, McKinley made another stage appearance three years ago in a work 
titled "Saints and Sinners," put on by his church, Sacred Heart in Saticoy. He 
was an understudy catapulted onto center stage when the emcee became ill. He 
got the itch. 
</P>
<P>
He ignored it until this spring. Then his 15-year-old daughter, Julie, youngest 
of the three McKinley children, asked him to drive her to an acting class at 
the college. He figured he might as well sign up for the heck of it. Director 
Jay Varela gave him the part. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a fatherly quality that is very, very nice," the director said, "There 
were others who knew a lot more about singing, but they didn't look right." 
</P>
<P>
Varela has been pleased with McKinley's dedication. "It's as if he were a 
17-year-old," he said. "He gets here early -- he drills -- he does absolutely 
whatever you tell him to do. He's had to learn a lot." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, McKinley is frankly in love with the play -- a Romeo-and-Juliet 
story with an upbeat ending. Beyond the comedy, he said, "It's a great 
metaphor." 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrating his depth of feeling, he recites lines from the play's hit tune, 
"Try To Remember": "Deep in December, it's nice to remember, without a hurt the 
heart is hollow. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He might even take up acting full time, he said, after his retirement. It could 
be used for something beyond entertainment -- perhaps the police department's 
drug and alcohol education program, DARE. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, "It is a great stress-reliever," he said, "It transposes you 
into somewhere you are not. But it's more than a temporary escape. It's got to 
feed the memory and feed the dream." 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: "The Fantasticks" continues its run at the Ventura College 
Theatre on Loma Vista between Day and Ashwood tonight, Friday and Saturday at 8 
p.m. A Sunday matinee is at 3 p.m. The box office opens half an hour before 
show time. General admission seats are $10; $7 for seniors, students and staff; 
and $5 for 10 or more tickets bought in advance. Free parking is available.

THEATER REVIEW: 'MOONDAISIES'; 
</P>
<P>
FLOWER POWER; 
</P>
<P>
ZANINESS IS THE OPERATIVE PHILOSOPHY IN 'MOONDAISIES,' INTENDED FOR CHILDREN 
AND ADULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first in a projected series of productions aimed at a young audience, Kent 
Hamilton's "Moondaisies" should appeal to children 10 and under and their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Currently being performed on Saturday and Sunday afternoons in a large tent 
behind the Simi Valley City Hall, the play is being produced under the auspices 
of the Santa Susana Repertory Company (of which author Hamilton is a trustee) 
and is being staged on the set constructed for the Company's recent version of 
"Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
Set in modern times, "Moondaisies" begins with a father, portrayed by producer 
Bill Rapp, cajoled into telling a bedtime story to his son and daughter, played 
by Joshua Nelson and Risa Littman. 
</P>
<P>
Upset by the childrens' accidental destruction of a portion of her garden, 
their mother has stipulated that a flower play a heroic role in the tale. 
</P>
<P>
The scene shifts to a "Star Wars"-like dimension, where the father and children 
have joined a group of "Space Pioneers," humanoid save for the requisite 
protagonist, a "moondaisy" who bears a startling resemblance to Mom. Enter a 
bunch of "Space Pirates," led by the evil Zap, who has no use for life and 
beauty. Confrontations, musical numbers and a fairly obvious ecological parable 
ensue. 
</P>
<P>
Zaniness is the operative philosophy here, with the Space Pirates a 
particularly doltish bunch played broadly and for maximum laughs by adults John 
Comstock, James Egan, Paul Roosevelt, Anthony Ross, Larry Transue, Kristin 
Scott and -- as leader Zap -- Dave Clare. 
</P>
<P>
It's with that bunch (many of whom, in different uniforms, also portray the 
good guys) that parents are going to have the most fun: the actors are having 
such a good time up there onstage that onlookers might easily envy them. 
</P>
<P>
Younger children should identify with the characters played by Nelson and 
Littman, and also go for the rough-and-tumble humor and the attractive cast. 
Sophisticated youngsters and teen-agers are likely to identify with the 
youngster who, at a particularly soppy moment, confesses to feeling like a 
co-star in a Care Bears movie. 
</P>
<P>
Acting, as such, is less Stanislavski here than Ronald McDonald. Leads Littman 
and Nelson perform notably well in relatively straight roles, and Nelson (who 
needs to project more when he sings) shows teen-idol potential. 
</P>
<P>
The performance seen for this review featured, as it happens, a couple of 
understudies. Theresa Reynolds filled in for Melissa Crook as the 
mother/moondaisy, and vocal coach Judy Sherman took Reynolds' usual place as 
"Ms. Morebucks, the Satellite of Greed." 
</P>
<P>
No slight intended on the absent Crook, who chose a bad day for a schedule 
conflict, but it's difficult to imagine how anyone could have played the part 
any better than Reynolds, who seemed properly motherly when called for and 
delightfully goofy when got up as a large, well-meaning and not particularly 
bright talking flower. 
</P>
<P>
The songs, by author Hamilton and composer Rick Field, were serviceable, but 
the lyrics tend to get lost under the ensemble vocals and prerecorded musical 
tracks. Director James Egan and choreographer Laura Squier keep things moving 
smoothly, and costume designer Kay Myregard succeeds in making much out of 
relatively little. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: "Moondaisies" will be performed Saturday and Sunday 
afternoons at 4 p.m. through Aug. 19 in the tent behind the Simi Valley City 
Hall and library complex, 2929 Tapo Canyon Road in Simi Valley. Tickets are $5.

Officials at Primary Purpose are celebrating the expansion of their drug and 
alcohol treatment organization. But just a few blocks from a ribbon-cutting 
scheduled for today, government officials are closing down another Primary 
Purpose facility for lack of a state license and city permit. 
</P>
<P>
Primary Purpose has six sites in Oxnard where it runs programs under government 
contract for alcoholics and drug addicts in various stages of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
City and state officials said they have no quarrel with five of the Primary 
Purpose sites. California Secretary of State March Fong Eu is expected to 
attend a reception at 12:30 p.m. today to celebrate the organization's new 
building at 840 W. 5th St. in Oxnard and the availability of 25 new beds. 
</P>
<P>
But the sixth facility, a 16-bed "grad house" at 161 West C St. for men in 
their first seven months of recovery from addiction, is expected to close 
within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Primary Purpose officials said they opened the facility in October, 1988, 
charging most residents $360 monthly, imposing restrictions such as an 11 p.m. 
weeknight curfew and requiring outside meetings. Director Dale McFadden said he 
didn't think it needed a state permit or city special-use permit. 
</P>
<P>
On April 20, however, city zoning officials warned Primary Purpose that it must 
obtain a special-use permit or revert to residential use. Oxnard code 
enforcement official Richard McIntosh said the permit would require, among 
other things, that the site get a state license as a care facility. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on May 9, state Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs officials arrived 
for an inspection. Three weeks later they wrote Primary Purpose officials, 
warning that the organization was legally required to get a license for 
residential alcohol and drug rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
McFadden said last week that he has applied for a state license but that an 
intergovernmental Catch-22 may require him to have the city permit before he 
can get it. He also said the cost of permit fees and site improvements could 
reach $5,000 and would strain his organization's finances. 
</P>
<P>
Until those issues are solved, McFadden said, the house will close. On July 12, 
he said, the program's recovering alcoholics and addicts were given 30 days to 
find a new residence. McFadden, who denounced the city's permit policies as 
archaic, asserted that "if you had a flophouse with no rules, they wouldn't 
bother you." 
</P>
<P>
He and others said the government actions might never have happened but for 
complaints by Oxnard attorney Barron Beil. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year Beil refused to pay rent for treatment his son received at 
the grad house, saying he was not satisfied with the program. In May, Primary 
Purpose filed a civil suit to evict Beil's 18-year-old son, Bradley, for 
failure to comply with house rules. On June 1, Presiding Municipal Judge Lee E. 
Cooper upheld Primary Purpose's position and ordered the younger Beil out. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Beil denounced Primary Purpose, where he said "the rule is you do 
whatever we say, when we say."

'FIDDLER' SALES GO TO THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Tevye belts out "If I Were a Rich Man," he is singing both to entertain 
and to restore Barnum Hall Theater at Santa Monica High School. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales from "Fiddler on the Roof," being staged by the Santa Monica Civic 
Light Opera at the Art Deco hall, go toward its continuing repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to fix as we go," said Frank X. Ford, artistic director of the 
2-year-old opera company. With about $25,000 raised from the opera's production 
of "Annie" last year and from individual and a few corporate donors, some of 
the sound system, lighting and electrical wiring have been repaired and the 
"termite-eaten orchestra pit" has been fixed, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
Still to do are the "bigger projects" to restore the historic hall to its 
original splendor, such as carpeting, reupholstering the seats and a paint job, 
which will take $250,000 to $500,000, Ford estimated. "It needs the Deco colors 
to match (the theater's architecture). Now, it's painted institutional beige." 
</P>
<P>
The restoration, he noted, is all cosmetic. The theater, built in 1937 as part 
of President Franklin Roosevelt's Work Projects Administration, is "poured 
concrete -- kind of like Hoover Dam," Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-seat hall, intended to be a community theater, was called "the Civic" 
by local residents, Ford said. The site of plays, lectures and concerts, it was 
the "cultural hub" of the city and the Westside, he said. It was later named 
after a longtime principal of Santa Monica High School. 
</P>
<P>
But then Santa Monica Civic Auditorium was built and Barnum Hall was pushed 
aside. Art Deco became passe, and Barnum got its beige coat of paint. "People 
stopped thinking of it as the civic center, but as a high school auditorium," 
said Ford, who is also a drama teacher at the school. 
</P>
<P>
The hall is rented out occasionally to orchestras and theater groups and has 
been used as an emergency courtroom by the Superior Court. Ford maintains that 
for drama it is preferable to the Civic Auditorium, which he described as "a 
good convention hall, and for big spectacles . . . (but) not a good theater for 
theater." 
</P>
<P>
Starring as Tevye is Peter Kevoian, who had roles in the Los Angeles 
productions of "Les Miserables" and "Cats." He understudied and performed the 
lead of Jean Valjean in Les Miserables, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fiddler on the Roof" will be performed tonight through Saturday at 8 p.m. For 
more information, call (213) 458-5939.

KEEP YOUR COOL; 
</P>
<P>
THERE ARE SEVERAL EASY STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO MAKE YOUR AIR CONDITIONER RUN MORE 
EFFICIENTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By DAVID LUSTIG

<TEXT>
<P>
Unless you live on the coastline, it's hot this time of the year. So you flip 
on the ol' central air-conditioning, listen for the satisfying ca-chink of the 
solenoid cranking up the unit and wait for the cool air of modern technology to 
bathe the sweat from your brow. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds fine, until you get the electric bill. What's this? It says you used as 
much juice as the entire city of Santa Paula did last month. It's that air 
conditioner, you exclaim to anyone who will listen. You didn't purposely waste 
electricity. You're the type of person who turns off lights in rooms that 
nobody is using, puts in long-lasting light bulbs, and turns the television off 
whenever you leave the room for more than a few minutes. It's that blasted air 
conditioner that's doing it. 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes and no. Sure, the air conditioner is putting an extra strain on the 
budget, but many of us who are real conservation nuts about light bulbs and 
stove pilot lights don't even think about the central air conditioner. But you 
can stay cool and cut down the outflow of hard-earned cash by servicing your 
air conditioner to maximize its efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Most manufacturers say the first thing to do is to have your equipment checked 
out. And if you haven't done so in a year or two, whatever the service charge 
is, it really wouldn't hurt to have someone come over and take a look. Now, 
here is where common sense comes in. 
</P>
<P>
If the unit is working properly and is less than 5 years old, service 
consultants from a number of manufacturers say, "If it ain't broken, don't fix 
it." OK, but there are a number of things you can do to make sure your air 
conditioner works easier. 
</P>
<P>
The most common maintenance point is to regularly change the air filter on the 
indoor part of the air conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
The air filter keeps the machine from sucking up muck as it draws in air to 
cool down and blow out through the vents. As the filter gets dirty, the air 
conditioner has to work harder to get the air it needs to do the job. The more 
it works, the more juice it needs and, you get the idea, the higher your 
electric bill, not to mention the wear and tear on the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But when the maintenance person comes, don't point in the direction of the air 
conditioner and go back to watching television. Watch what he or she is doing. 
More important, find out exactly where that air filter is so that next time, 
instead of calling out the cavalry, you can do it yourself. 
</P>
<P>
If you're going to do it yourself, make sure the unit is off. Now, if you 
remembered where the maintenance person found it, or you have the instruction 
book that came with the unit, look for the air filter. There's a good chance 
it's made of blue gauzy stuff in a black cardboard frame, with a thin aluminum 
grid of round circles on one side to hold it together. 
</P>
<P>
As you slide the filter halfway out, look carefully at how it fits. Found that 
piece of thin aluminum with the round circles? Remember on which side it goes. 
It'll be important later. 
</P>
<P>
Now, take it outside (stay inside if you like, but don't be angry when a lot of 
the sooty glop on the filter falls onto your floor) and carefully look for some 
numbers on the outside of the black cardboard frame. Sooner or later, you'll 
find something like 12 x 15, or 20 x 25. That translates to 12 inches by 15 
inches and 20 inches by 25 inches. It can be any set of dimensions, so don't 
worry if these aren't your numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Write down the numbers (once you see the dozens of sizes, you'll be glad you 
wrote them down) and head off to the garden, discount or do-it-yourself store 
of your choice. Buy two or three or four. They're cheap, so why run to the 
store every few months for another? Store the others in a closet, but be 
careful, they're easily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Remembering which side had the aluminum grid, slide the new air filter back 
into its snug home. (Some filters have an arrow printed on the side to indicate 
the direction of air flow.) Button up the machine and fire it up. Put a piece 
of tape on the inside of the door with the date on which you changed the 
filter. Three months from now, change it again. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not the only thing you can do to lengthen the life of your air 
conditioner and reduce electricity consumption. You can see if there are any 
coolant leaks. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, put a thermometer by one of vents and let it get good and cold 
from the air blast for about five or 10 minutes. Record the temperature and do 
it for five days straight, preferably at the same time of the day so that the 
outside temperature will be as uniform as possible). 
</P>
<P>
If the temperature stays the same, it doesn't necessarily mean you have enough 
refrigerant, but it will probably indicate that there are no leaks. If the 
temperature gradually rises over the period, you may have a leaky valve or 
cracked hose somewhere that is leaking coolant. Since some types of coolants 
are the enemy of the Earth's ozone layer, by fixing leaks you are not only 
saving money but also protecting the atmosphere.

Is your house or apartment empty all day because you're at work, but you leave 
the air conditioner on anyway in order to come home to a nice, cool place? 
You're wasting electricity. Not to mention that you are wearing out the air 
conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
Many units can be connected to a thermostat with a built-in timer (perhaps a 
little expensive, but it's a one-time-only cost) that can be set to turn on the 
air conditioner about an hour before you come home and turn it off about an 
hour after you go to bed. Caution. Unless you're a skilled electrician, 
replacing a thermostat is something you shouldn't do yourself -- this is your 
house wiring you're playing with, so let a professional do it. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't have a maintenance book, get one. Somewhere on the machine is a 
plate that states the manufacturer and model. Call or write a letter and ask 
for a replacement. There may be a small charge. 
</P>
<P>
Inside will probably be a list of servicing points that a homeowner can 
regularly do by himself or herself. Familiarize yourself with the machine's 
main on/off switch in case of an emergency, and go outside and clean the leaves 
and junk off the external parts of the air conditioner. And when you turn off 
the air for the last time this year, think about wrapping up that external 
casing in a plastic garbage bag to keep the rain and dirt out. You'd do the 
same for a back-yard barbecue, wouldn't you? 
</P>
<P>
But if all this is still too technical for you, don't be afraid to call a 
maintenance person. Find out if a friend uses someone, and if he or she is 
satisfied, call and see if that person will service your equipment. Or look in 
the Yellow Pages under "Air-Conditioning Contractors &amp; Systems." 
</P>
<P>
When the heat is gone and it's time to wonder if the furnace is going to work, 
make a note to yourself to call for servicing, or at least change the filter, 
just before the hot weather sets in next year. Wouldn't it be nice to know of 
any cooling problems before the heat sets in again?

AT 4 FOOT, 6 INCHES, EVAN ARTRAN HAS SEEN THE WORLD'S GRAND OPPORTUNITIES AND 
SMALL MINDS. 
</P>

Evan Artran runs his own print shop, lives in his own house in Simi Valley, and 
he and his wife are raising their three children -- no problem. But trying to 
use a water fountain or find a pair of shoes for his size 5EEE feet -- that's a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
At 4 foot, 6 inches, Artran doesn't consider being a dwarf a true handicap. But 
the daily hassles of living in a world constructed for taller people does have 
its irksome aspects. Insensitivity is not the least of them. Artran still 
winces when telling about the time an adult saw him passing by and yelled out, 
"Look, there goes a Munchkin!" 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe that there are still some adults out there that can be 
that rude," Artran said. "The environmental problems, such as pay phones that 
are too high to reach or all those big cars that you can't reach the pedals, 
are easy to fix. But the big problem is some people's negative attitudes to 
anyone different from themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"But all in all, things have changed drastically in the past 10 years. I think 
it has a lot to do with all the exposure and advances handicapped individuals 
and ethnic minorities have gained recently. There's more acceptance and less 
prejudice these days." 
</P>
<P>
Artran also credited the Little People of America as a catalyst for some of the 
changes. The organization, which has about 6,000 members, through meetings, 
conventions and a quarterly newsletter provides useful information regarding 
dwarfism, and social support to a group of people who often feel isolated in a 
tall world. 
</P>
<P>
The Artran family has just returned from the organization's 33rd annual 
national convention. About 500 people met in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho for the 
four-day event which ended Tuesday. Featured were sporting competitions, a 
fashion show and workshops. As one of 12 district directors in the country, 
Artran's territory includes California, Hawaii and Nevada. He is organizing the 
next district convention scheduled for Nov. 2-4 in Concord. 
</P>
<P>
Artran, his wife, Marilyn, and two of their children, Daniel, 16, and Michelle 
11, are achondroplasia dwarfs, which is the most common form of the more than 
200 types of dwarfism. They have an average-size torso but their limbs are 
short. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was younger kids use to tease me and stuff, but now that they've gotten 
older and more mature they don't do it anymore," Daniel said. "The problem that 
I have now as a teen-ager is girls and dating. Most tall girls won't go out 
with me, but I don't really get upset about that. I can understand. But still 
it's hard. It's the worst at school dances. 
</P>
<P>
"One good thing about the convention is that I get to meet girls my size." 
</P>
<P>
The Artrans' second son, Clint, was born average size, and doctors predict that 
he'll grow to be six feet tall. At 5 foot 2, the 12-year-old already towers 
over the rest of his family. 
</P>
<P>
Dwarfism is caused by a genetic mutation -- a regular-size child can be born to 
dwarf parents, or a dwarf can be born to a family with no prior incidence of 
dwarfism. 
</P>
<P>
"In some countries having a dwarf child is considered a curse upon the family, 
a social stigma," Artran said. "There are stories of parents literally leaving 
their child at a bus station. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are better in America but you still hear about people giving up their 
baby for adoption because it is small and doesn't look right." 
</P>
<P>
The LPA quarterly newsletter contains a section for the names and pictures of 
dwarf children up for adoption. The newsletter also features a section on 
newlywed couples. According to Artran, about 85% of the dwarfs he knows marry 
other dwarfs, and it seems that most of them meet each other through LPA. In 
fact, the Artrans met more than 20 years ago at an LPA-sponsored ice skating 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd prefer it if my dwarf children marry other dwarfs," Marilyn Artran said. 
"It's nice to be able to walk side by side with your spouse; to be able to turn 
around and whisper something romantic in his ear without first having to yell 
at him to stoop down. It's nice to be able to dance with your husband, not his 
belt buckle." 
</P>
<P>
Dating and adolescence are topics Evan Artran recalls with a wince. "Growing up 
was tough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a long, hard road, he said, but Artran is now able to deal with rude 
people in a positive manner. But there are a few things that still grate. Like 
most dwarfs, he does not want to be called a midget, which is a slang term. 
"And every now and then someone will pat me on the head. It takes all of my 
control," said the brown belt, "not to use my judo on them." 
</P>

Outlook: "LPA was designed for people 4 foot 10 and under for a medical reason. 
But I won't hold a tape measure up to anyone to check. If a taller person wants 
to join, that's fine with me. Restricting what someone can do because of their 
height, whether it be short or tall, is a real bugaboo of mine."

A jury in Miami was selected to decide a lawsuit that blames retired Air Force 
Major Gen. Richard V. Secord and a CIA-linked airline for the 1986 plane crash 
in Nicaragua that helped trigger the Iran-Contra probe. Cargo handler Eugene 
Hasenfus, who was captured and held for about three months after Nicaraguan 
troops shot down the plane, and the family of the plane's co-pilot, Wallace 
Sawyer Jr., contend in the suit that Secord and Miami-based Southern Air 
Transport used unsafe aircraft in the Contra resupply effort.

FEDERAL, LOCAL POLICE RAID HOUSE IN SAN DIMAS, DISCOVER HUGE DRUG LAB; 
</P>
<P>
RAID: FOUR PEOPLE ARE ARRESTED IN WHAT MAY BE THE LARGEST AND MOST 
SOPHISTICATED METHAMPHETAMINE MANUFACTURING OPERATION EVER UNCOVERED IN 
CALIFORNIA. ABOUT 700 POUNDS OF THE DRUG ARE SEIZED. 
</P>

<P>
More than a dozen federal and local law enforcement officers descended upon a 
house in a quiet San Dimas neighborhood Wednesday and found what is believed to 
be the largest and most sophisticated methamphetamine laboratory ever 
discovered in California. 
</P>
<P>
The four-bedroom house with an attached garage contained at least 700 pounds of 
the drug in various states of processing and in various forms, including 300 
pounds of the clear, potent form known on the street as "ice." Officials put 
the street value of the drugs at $31 million. 
</P>
<P>
Three men and a woman who were in the house at the time of the 8 a.m. raid were 
arrested and several guns were confiscated, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters taken on a tour around the outside of the single-story, stucco and 
brick-facade dwelling could see through windows and a glass sliding door that 
nearly every room was filled with chemicals and equipment used in processing 
methamphetamine -- including huge glass beakers attached to heating units, 
large metal drums and pressurized tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The house -- which neighbors in the 500 block of East Baseline Road said was 
rented out by its owner about three months ago -- was so contaminated with 
toxic and hazardous chemicals that officials said it might have to be razed. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of the chemicals could have at any time caused an explosion, said 
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who, along with Sheriff Sherman Block, 
held an afternoon press conference outside the home as hazardous waste 
technicians began a massive cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the LAPD and the Sheriff's Department provided information 
over the last two months that led to the execution of a search warrant 
Wednesday, the two officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They speculated that a swimming pool in the back yard of the home that was 
filled with dirty, green water may have been used to dump chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The lab, they said, was capable of producing about 70 pounds of the drug weekly 
and probably supplied the entire Western section of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Its operators, the officials said, may have planned to sell the drug to "crack" 
or rock cocaine users as the supply of cocaine dwindles nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"The ice clearly can be substituted for rock cocaine," Gates said, adding that 
it was unusual for a methamphetamine lab to be set up in a highly populated 
area. Most such operations, he said, are found in rural or desert areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not seen ice in any significant amounts on the streets of Los Angeles, 
because rock cocaine was readily available," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Jim Welch, chief of the LAPD's clandestine lab unit who took part in the 
raid, said the four arrests were made without incident. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared, he said, that at least one person was at the house at all times 
and that several people slept there overnight. Diapers found inside indicated 
that a child was sometimes kept there. Welch said officers also found records 
of the drug operation, including "a journal of every batch they cooked up." 
</P>
<P>
As police technicians dressed in jumpers, gloves and paper shoe covers combed 
the house, cataloguing and packaging evidence, neighbors stood along the street 
in small groups, watching. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw people coming and going sometimes, but they didn't talk to anybody," 
said one man, who would not give his name. "We don't know what kind of people 
they were. They were very secretive." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had seen a little girl, about 3 years old, at the house on several 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Yount, who lives a few doors away, said the only odd thing she had 
noticed about the raided house was that its lawn was unkempt. 
</P>
<P>
"That's unusual for this street," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other area residents said the home's owner moved out earlier this year and 
planned to sell the house, but was renting it in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
Gates and Block said that, under the law, the owner, identified in property 
records as Davinder S. Sekhon, will have to pay for the cleanup of the 
chemicals and the razing of the house, if that becomes necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"If you lease your house to someone and they use it for a drug operation, then 
any loss that results is the responsibility of the owner," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Sekhon could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities identified the four people in custody as Carlos Castaneda, 47, 
Charlie Lopez, 24, Luis Macias, 60, and Deborah Babakitas, 24. They were booked 
at the sheriff's Walnut substation on suspicion of manufacturing narcotics.

BRADLEY VOWS NO RELOCATION FOR OWNERS OF HOMES IN WATTS; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: MAYOR RESPONDS TO PROTEST OF STUDY CALLING FOR THE ELIMINATION 
OF URBAN BLIGHT. SOME RESIDENTS SAY HIS POSITION ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reacting to a storm of community protests, Mayor Tom Bradley pledged Wednesday 
to oppose any redevelopment plan in Watts that would displace homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line," Bradley said, "is if you live in Watts in a single-family 
residence, you don't need to fear losing your home. It won't happen. That is my 
commitment to you." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's promise -- grounded in his veto authority over City Council actions 
-- appears to run counter to the language of the city-sponsored feasibility 
study, which lays the foundation for the Watts project. The study calls for the 
elimination of urban blight through "selective demolition . . . and 
relocation". 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, which is in charge of 
the project, said they did not know how a broad prohibition against eminent 
domain would affect the project, which is designed to bring new industrial, 
commercial and cultural facilities to the impoverished community. 
</P>
<P>
"Where and how those things will be built, where the new commercial and 
industrial areas will be . . . that will all have to be decided and decided by 
the residents themselves," said Robert Tague, the CRA's chief of operations. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also announced at a press conference that he had postponed the first 
phase of the Watts project -- the period when the planning is done -- for at 
least six months. The mayor's action could delay groundbreaking for the project 
for two years or more, according to CRA officials. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement came in response to angry criticism that the city was trying 
to ram through the project before the people of Watts had any idea of what was 
in store for them. Bradley said he agreed with the complaints of many residents 
that they had not been given enough time to learn about the impact of what 
would be the largest redevelopment project ever undertaken by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Several Watts residents attending the press conference praised the mayor for 
postponing the project, but said his position on eminent domain was not strong 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have a law passed by the City Council barring eminent domain," said 
Andreattee Jones, a resident and education coordinator at a neighborhood youth 
center. "No one should have to worry about getting kicked out of their house." 
</P>
<P>
Eminent domain refers to a longstanding government prerogative to condemn 
private property when it serves the public good. It has been invoked to build 
everything from freeways to schools. It would be a more ticklish issue in the 
Watts project, however, if houses were to be condemned for commercial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Jones and others said Bradley's promise to protect homeowners offered slim 
consolation to the thousands of renters who live in one of the densest 
concentrations of public housing projects in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said the fate of the tenants should be decided during the planning 
phase. "The community is going to give the answer on that matter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing with Bradley, the two City Council members who represent Watts sought 
to offer tenants more reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
"It would not be in my plans to diminish the total amount of affordable 
housing," said Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores. 
</P>
<P>
"No residentially zoned properties, period," said Councilman Robert Farrell, 
when asked where he stood on the question of tearing down rental buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The official assurances were not enough to deter a group of Watts residents 
from pressing a lawsuit against the city and the CRA. After filing the suit 
Monday, the plaintiffs returned to court Wednesday, seeking to enjoin the city 
from using eminent domain in Watts. If successful, the suit also would diminish 
the city's authority over the Watts Project Area Committee -- a citizens' group 
that will be formed to oversee project planning. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have argued that the City Council violated state redevelopment law by 
giving itself the power to appoint 11 of the 25 committee members. Control of 
the committee is emerging as an important issue in the redevelopment dispute, 
with critics fearful that the City Council would overload the committee with 
developers and businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
The Watts project is significant not only for its size -- about 2,000 acres of 
South-Central Los Angeles -- but for what it represents. It is the first 
comprehensive approach to rebuilding Watts since the rioting 25 years ago. 
Despite periodic attempts to upgrade the community, Watts has remained one of 
the poorest, most run-down and dangerous parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had counted on an enthusiastic reception after spending the last 
18 months developing a broad outline for the project. In addition to financing 
new buildings, the proposed revitalization would pour $200 million in public 
and private capital into neighborhood social services such as job training, 
drug counseling and day care. 
</P>
<P>
But residents argued that they had been kept in the dark until just before the 
City Council gave preliminary approval in June. Moreover, at community meetings 
last month, officials did little to allay people's fears of losing their homes. 
Many people said they were suspicious of the city's sudden interest in Watts 
after years of comparative inattention. 
</P>
<P>
"Why the sudden interest now? Where were you 25 years ago?" asked one resident 
at the press conference. "Is it because of the Metro Rail or the Century 
Freeway that you are interested in remaking our community." 
</P>

Even without a redevelopment project, Watts' years as an urban backwater may be 
over, the result of a network of new rail and freeway routes that crisscross 
the community on the way to downtown Los Angeles, Long Beach and the city's 
main airport and harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents suspect that city officials would like to turn Watts into a 
bedroom annex for downtown office workers. Others worry that they will be 
squeezed out by a commercial and industrial renaissance that will offer few 
jobs that local people are capable of filling.

POLICE WATCH WARILY AS GROWING NUMBERS OF GANG MEMBERS FLOCK TO SHORELINE 
</P>

This summer, as stifling heat has driven huge crowds to the beaches and kept 
them there long into the night, their ranks have included growing numbers of 
gang members and, watching warily, newly strengthened police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
Already a familiar presence at Santa Monica Pier, Venice Beach and Dockweiler 
State Beach, gang members have been showing up in unprecedented numbers at 
beaches from Malibu to San Pedro, according to police and lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, it is something you read about as a problem in someone else's 
community. But today, this year, now, it is something we are seeing on the 
beach," said Randy DeGregori, assistant chief lifeguard for the Los Angeles 
County Department of Beaches and Harbors. 
</P>
<P>
So far this summer, authorities say, there have been few violent outbursts by 
gangs at the beach. But as the growing numbers of gang members increase the 
chances of confrontations, police have moved quickly to prevent friction from 
escalating into violence. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police have added five officers to their Pacific Division beach 
patrols and extended patrol hours to 10:30 p.m. Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies have added similar patrols on Malibu Beach. Santa Monica police are 
now enforcing a 10 p.m. curfew to force juveniles away from the city's pier. 
Even the county's 700 lifeguards are for the first time being trained to 
recognize gang members and deal with incidents they may cause in beach areas. 
</P>
<P>
The gang members usually loiter in beach parking lots, drinking and carousing, 
but rarely venturing onto the sand, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Early last Friday morning, police said, a 29-year-old Hollywood woman was 
allegedly gang-raped in a beach parking lot north of the Santa Monica Pier. 
Although details are sketchy, Santa Monica police said they are investigating 
reports that the six suspects were gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours before that incident, after a dance concert ended on the pier, six 
gang members from Santa Monica milled about in the middle of the pier. As the 
10 p.m. curfew passed, they remained at the pier, eyed by four other young gang 
members who stood nearby, leaning against a railing. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed all in black, the four gang members began to saunter away when a 
reporter approached them. But one of the youths, who wore a Los Angeles Raiders 
cap cocked askew on his head, said: "We're not from down here" -- a response 
that police say indicates that they were gang members from some other area. 
</P>
<P>
"They're coming here from East L.A. and the Valley, from San Gabriel and 
Wilmington and West Covina," said Oscar, 18, a professed gang member who was 
one of the other six youths on the pier. "Why? They want to party over here. 
It's boring over there, wherever they're from." 
</P>
<P>
Oscar and his fellow gang members claim that shootings are not uncommon near 
the beaches, but that few show up in crime reports. Police find out, they said, 
only if someone is killed or seriously hurt, but not when the bullets miss or 
cause minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Police keep few statistics on gang-related incidents at state and local 
beaches. And those who do rarely break them down into areas as small as 
individual beaches. There have been a few incidents in which gang members have 
intimidated, robbed or assaulted beach-goers, police say. But more often, gangs 
clash with each other in fistfights and taunts that usually go unreported. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not seeing such a high incidence that . . . is alarming or 
overwhelming," DeGregori said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturdays and Sundays, as many as 400 gang members hang out in the parking 
lots at Venice and Dockweiler, said Los Angeles Police Capt. Patrick Froehle, 
who supervises Pacific Division units from the Santa Monica city line to El 
Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Priscilla Thiry, who lives a block from Venice Beach, said gang members descend 
on her neighborhood "intensively," causing trouble and leaving graffiti. Thiry 
said she has complained to seven different police watch commanders and patrol 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Like other teen-agers on summer break, gang members head for the shore to 
socialize and have a good time. But by "flying their colors" -- flaunting their 
gang ties with tattoos, baggy pants, jewelry and other gang-related clothing -- 
they can easily turn a routine outing into a confrontation with a rival gang, 
authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
The mere act of wearing their colors is enough to get some gang members ejected 
from beach areas. "If you're going to go there to fly your colors," said 
Detective Bill Humphry of the Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang 
Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums unit, "you'll be asked to leave 
because all you're doing is provoking a confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
On July 15, Humphry said, police ordered one gang member to leave Venice Beach 
for wearing his colors. He ignored officers' orders and then kicked one 
officer, Humphry said. The man was then arrested on charges of battery against 
a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, during pre-dawn July 4 fireworks at the pier, two men were 
shot by suspected gang members who were later arrested, said Detective Erroll 
Southers of that city's gang unit. Gang violence forced the city to move its 
fireworks show from night to early morning several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
According to Southers, the Santa Monica Pier is among the most popular gang 
hangouts in the area. "It's open all night, it's cool, you can come here with 
your homeboys or your girlfriend and hang out and play . . . ," Southers said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that most beach-goers are safe "unless it is a crime of opportunity. . 
. . If John Doe is getting into his Porsche and no one's around, they'll try to 
take it. But that is unusual, even if there's 50 of them (gang members)." 
</P>
<P>
But locals like Juan Gonzales, a cashier at the Beachcomber gift shop on the 
pier, disagree. "When the gangbangers from East L.A. or the Valley come down on 
the weekend now, there's always problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The young ones, they're pretty crazy," Gonzales said. "They want to prove 
themselves, and they're dangerous. If they want money, they'll get it any way 
they can."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRANDO'S RELEASE ON BAIL DELAYED BY LOST 
PASSPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Marlon Brando's son, Christian, facing trial in the slaying of his 
half-sister's boyfriend, will remain jailed until his passport can be found and 
surrendered to authorities, his lawyer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A judge on Tuesday set Brando's bail at $10 million, with the condition that he 
give up his passport to help ensure that he does not flee to avoid prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Brando's family has the option of posting the bond -- believed the highest 
amount in Los Angeles County history -- in either cash, property or a 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Shapiro, Christian's lawyer, said he and the family have been unable 
to locate Brando's passport and that Brando will remain in jail "until we find 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Brando, 32, a welder, is next scheduled to appear in Superior Court in Santa 
Monica Aug. 7 to enter a plea to charges that he murdered Dag Drollet, 26, the 
Tahitian boyfriend of Cheyenne Brando and father of her child, born in June.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS DEBATING WHEN TO REPLACE 
CHAFFEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a second session behind closed doors, the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors Wednesday failed to make a final decision on whether Robert L. 
Chaffee, who resigned last week as chief of the county's Department for 
Children's Services, should remain in office until October or be replaced 
immediately by an interim director. 
</P>
<P>
However, the board is leaning toward hiring an interim director, and is 
seriously considering asking a retired judge to take the job, according to 
Supervisor Ed Edelman and an aide to Supervisor Michael Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Edelman, who has been pressing for an interim director, nor the 
Antonovich aide would name the judge, and both said that the judge is not 
certain he can accept the job. "We don't have a definite commitment" Edelman 
said. "The point is we are moving in that direction, which is the direction 
that I favor." 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee resigned last week amid mounting criticism of his agency.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BLACK ACTIVIST LOSES BID TO REMAIN FREE ON 
BAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A black community activist lost a bid Wednesday to remain free on bail while 
appealing his conviction on two burglary counts. 
</P>
<P>
Jitu Sadiki, who was sentenced last week to three years and eight months in 
prison, had sought to be freed on bail while fighting a conviction that he 
claims is the outgrowth of a racially motivated prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge James Albracht on Wednesday denied Sadiki's request 
and Sadiki, 34, will be transferred from County Jail to state prison. He 
previously served six years in state prison for second-degree murder in the 
death of a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted June 27 of two counts of burglary for breaking into a beauty 
shop in Culver City and trying to tunnel his way into an adjoining pawn shop in 
July, 1988.

$550,000 STRAD VIOLIN STOLEN AT L.A. AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What was to be a vacation quickly turned into "a nightmare" for Erich 
Gruenberg, when his rare Stradivarius violin, valued at $550,000, was stolen 
shortly after he arrived at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"It is irreplaceable," the 65-year-old English concert violinist said 
Wednesday. "It is my life." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said the Stradivarius, along with a second Hirsch violin 
valued at $8,000, were stolen Tuesday afternoon, shortly after Gruenberg and 
his wife, Korshed, arrived from England on a British Airways flight. 
</P>
<P>
"They were taken off a cart after he cleared customs," said Detective William 
Martin, the LAPD's specialist in art theft. 
</P>
<P>
The detective said he believes that the thieves probably did not know the 
simple, tan-colored oblong case contained violins. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless they had X-ray vision, they couldn't know what was inside," Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police statistics show there have been an average 181 thefts a month at the 
airport so far this year, or about six a day. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Gruenberg, apparently yet another victim, kept reliving and 
retelling those few seconds when the theft occurred, as though he could not 
believe it happened. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, pale Londoner, who has been concertmaster of the London Symphony 
Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic and is now an international concert 
soloist, is staying at the Pacific Palisades home of Harold Hirsch, an old 
friend and the maker of the second stolen violin. 
</P>
<P>
Seated on a sofa, Gruenberg told a reporter that he was loading his luggage 
into Hirsch's Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
"I put two suitcases in the trunk." Gruenberg said, and, as was his custom, 
went to take the violins inside the car with him. 
</P>
<P>
"The violin never goes in the trunk," Korshed Gruenberg said as she sat nearby, 
visibly upset and near tears. 
</P>
<P>
Gruenberg continued: "I turned around, I said to my wife, 'Darling, where's the 
violin?' I looked right and left, back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I thought, this is a bad dream." 
</P>
<P>
Instruments created by Antonio Stradivari, the 17th- and 18th-Century violin 
maker, are considered unsurpassed in sound quality. Only about 650 still exist 
and they are often used by the world's leading players. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people who took it were not aware of what they took," Gruenberg 
said. "I hope they just left it somewhere and somebody will find it, and return 
it to me." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with knowledge of the instruments' whereabouts should call the Los 
Angeles Police Department. The Austrian-born violinist added that he "would 
consider some kind of reward" for their return. The instruments are insured, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gruenberg said he acquired the Stradivarius from a violin dealer in London in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
For a serious musician, he said, throughout life "you try to find an instrument 
you bond with. You become like a team." 
</P>
<P>
"He just played a few strings of that and I said, 'Eric you don't give it 
back,' " Korshed Gruenberg said, recalling the day the couple first saw the 
Stradivarius. "I love it so much. It's like mine, too. I feel like someone has 
kidnaped my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
During their planned three-week vacation, Gruenberg said, he had agreed to do a 
private recording of a concerto composed by a UCLA professor later this week. 
Even though he may not have his precious instrument, or his second violin, 
Gruenberg said he will still meet the engagement. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, you can play any violin," he said. "I'll borrow another violin from 
Mr. Hirsch." 
</P>
<P>
But it will make a difference, Gruenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference would be difficult to explain. It's like defining quality," the 
violinist said, quietly. "What you pay for in a violin is an indefinable depth 
and color in sound. If you compare it to a mountain lake, the light shines on 
it like iridescence, and there is depth; endless depths. 
</P>
<P>
"With other instruments in five minutes, they can't give me anything new."

DWP'S RESPONSE TO LEAK LEAVES RESIDENTS STEAMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Stephen Nahmias and his neighbors saw all that clear, cool water gushing 
down the street past their thirsty brown lawns, they practically salivated. 
"I'd be really happy if we could get that water up on my lawn," Nahmias joked. 
</P>
<P>
But when the leaking water line in the middle of the 1000 block of South 
Hayworth Avenue continued spewing a river the third day after residents 
reported the problem to the Department of Water and Power, the covetous looks 
turned to scowls. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an appalling situation," said Nahmias, a stockbroker who owns one of 
the neat Spanish-style duplexes that flank the Mid-Wilshire area street. The 
waste was especially egregious, he said, given drought-ridden Southern 
California's ongoing battle for water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Nahmias and his conservation-minded neighbors have stopped watering lawns, 
hired plumbers to patch leaky pipes and reduced the water flow in showers and 
toilets to save water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It rubs a really raw nerve at this point," he said of the thousands of gallons 
of water he and his neighbors watched flow down storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
But to the DWP, it was just one of those things. 
</P>
<P>
According to DWP officials, the work crew that checked the leak Monday evening 
-- and did not return until Wednesday afternoon -- correctly assessed it as 
less than a top priority. There were at least half a dozen more substantial 
water leaks each day this week, including several broken mains, in the 
department's western district alone, said Larry McReynolds, the engineer in 
charge of DWP's water operating division. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a number of small leaks that we won't be able to respond 
to quickly enough to satisfy everyone," said McReynolds, adding that the Los 
Angeles system is plagued by deteriorating water lines and meters built in 
pre-World War II years. Despite the department's programs to replace tens of 
thousands of outdated meters and more than a hundred miles of water line each 
year, the system still suffers from a high rate of leaks each summer and winter 
because of the temperature extremes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials estimate that the DWP loses 8% of its water, or 1.8 billion 
gallons annually, through leaks, evaporation and faulty meters. 
</P>
<P>
Although the department's efforts have reduced the number of leaks in the 
system over the years, McReynolds said that growing public awareness of the 
drought and the need for water conservation have nearly doubled the number of 
calls from residents reporting leaks and other water waste to DWP. 
</P>
<P>
The increased awareness has led to increased frustration, as well, said 
McReynolds. "The public expects us to correct problems overnight -- especially 
since we're the ones urging conservation," he said. But that's not always 
possible, he said, noting that high-priority leaks usually take from one to two 
days to repair. Lower-priority leaks, such as the one on Hayworth Avenue, can 
take even longer. 
</P>
<P>
But because of the amount of work involved in repairing even low-priority 
leaks, crews -- like the one sent to Hayworth Avenue -- sometimes leave without 
even starting the repair work. 
</P>
<P>
While personnel have been reassigned from other duties to increase the number 
of leak-repair crews in operation during the busy summer months, McReynolds 
said that it would not be cost effective to hire additional workers to deal 
with the leaks. The water loss is minor, he added, compared to the district's 
total water consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Try telling that to Stephen Nahmias and his neighbors. On Wednesday -- two days 
after they reported the leak on their street to DWP -- Nahmias' question 
remained: "Where the hell are they and why isn't anybody at least patching the 
leak to stop the water flow?" 
</P>
<P>
DWP work crews sealed the leaking water line later that afternoon, after a 
Times reporter called to inquire about the matter. McReynolds said the repair 
had been scheduled for that afternoon since Monday.

WE SHOULD BE FIRST

By RICHARD CLOSE, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., believes a 
rail-transit system should have been implemented in the San Fernando Valley 
first. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission said we're one of three routes 
being considered for (rapid-transit) funding, but they put us third on the 
list! Because of the population and problems in the Valley, we should be first. 
They're putting Pasadena and the South Bay ahead of us. 
</P>
<P>
We think there's more population and more of a problem in the Valley than in 
those areas. The proposal to extend Metro Rail into the Valley is a question of 
how much money and political clout we can generate in Los Angeles and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of building cute trolley-car lines, we've got to focus on where the 
problem is the most severe -- in the San Fernando Valley. $877 million dollars 
would have been better spent building a line in the Valley rather than between 
downtown and Long Beach. They laughed at (former county Supervisor) Baxter 
Ward's proposal (in the early '70s to implement citywide rail transit). If they 
had implemented it, it would have been much cheaper and would have alleviated 
the mess we have now.

How can you stop sand and dirt from blowing in the desert? 
</P>
<P>
That's what air quality officials wondered Wednesday after coming to the 
Antelope Valley to declare that the high desert's air is fairly good. But the 
officials were sandbagged by residents who complained of sandstorms so bad this 
summer that they sometimes can't see across the street.

"Since March, I've hardly been able to see my horse," said Karen Jahns, noting 
that her animal stands only about 250 feet from her house. Jahns, a resident of 
Rosamond, a small community about 80 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, 
said her complaints have drawn no action. 
</P>
<P>
"Our vision is less than 100 feet where we're living. We can't see across the 
street," said Mary Massarella, a resident of nearby Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials and residents say sandstorms in the high desert this year are 
the worst they have seen in decades. 
</P>
<P>
Those who live in the fast-growing region blame the storms on a fourth year of 
drought that has left the high desert bone dry, the accompanying decline of 
farming that used to provide ground cover, and construction activity that 
strips bare the land. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the fact that the desert is, after all, filled with sand. 
</P>
<P>
During a two-hour hearing in Palmdale, residents were first surprised that air 
quality officials did not seem much aware of the extent of the sandstorms, 
which have come sporadically this year. Later, residents were disappointed that 
not much was offered in the way of solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to pave over the desert or anything like that. Blowing sand 
from the desert, these's no way we can deal with that," said Chung Liu, 
planning manager for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which 
enforces air quality rules in Los Angeles and three adjoining counties. 
</P>
<P>
Liu and other officials told the 40 or so people at the hearing that the AQMD 
generally cannot enforce air quality rules against naturally occurring 
conditions. And he said it is difficult to determine if construction or 
stripped farmland, or nature, is the cause. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials held the hearing to announce that they, along with Kern County 
officials, plan to continue an 18-month-old air-monitoring program in the 
Antelope Valley for another 18 months. Its purpose is to determine whether the 
area complies with a key federal standard for microscopic particles of airborne 
dust, dirt, sand and other materials -- known officially as particulates or 
PM10 -- that can be inhaled and cause respiratory problems. Although most of 
urban Southern California does not meet that standard, AQMD officials said they 
believe the Antelope Valley does. 
</P>
<P>
Residents complained that the AQMD's readings for the area are inadequate. 
Although the AQMD has a monitoring station in downtown Lancaster, residents 
argued that conditions elsewhere can be much different. And they protested the 
AQMD's practice of taking readings only every six days. 
</P>
<P>
If an area is found not to be in compliance, the state can require remedies, 
including restrictions on developers whose projects stir up dust, and requiring 
slower speeds on dusty roads. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the high desert's compliance status for particulates is still 
uncertain. But AQMD officials said readings from their Lancaster monitoring 
station last year met the federal standard. And they promised to take readings 
in outlying areas to assess residents' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster last year had a daily average of 47 micrograms of PM10 per cubic 
meter of air, the lowest of seven monitoring sites in Los Angeles County and 
below the federal daily standard of 50. But AQMD officials said sandstorms may 
produce larger particles not covered by the regulation.

THE AGE-OLD LURE TO BE AS FREE AS A BIRD STILL KEEPS TUGGING

<P>
In everything from hot air balloons to helicopters, people are jumping at the 
opportunity to soar, dangle and float over North County. 
</P>
<P>
Although the aerial excursions are rarely what one would call cheap, they can 
be reasonably affordable. A glider flight for one over Warner Springs can cost 
as little as $34 and as much as $93. Balloon flights range in price from $120 
to $160 a person. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a unique opportunity," said Alan Jenkins, a 36-year-old police 
officer after a recent balloon flight. "When you're going to have an experience 
that you will remember for the rest of your life, it's worth $135." 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few of the aviation experiences available in North County: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BALLOONS 
</P>
<P>
Sunset balloon flights over the San Dieguito River Valley in Del Mar are 
probably North County's best-known way to see the ground from the sky. Nearly a 
dozen different companies offer such flights. 
</P>
<P>
One recent Friday evening, 13 of the multicolored hot-air balloons floated over 
the valley, just east of Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most romantic form of aviation," said Sam Slaughter, the operations 
manager and a pilot for A Beautiful Morning company of Del Mar. "It's very 
soothing." 
</P>
<P>
Many balloonists offer sunrise flights as well, though coastal fog typically 
make the evening flights a better buy. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Slaughter said, "People aren't as grumpy." 
</P>
<P>
The average altitude on a balloon flight is between 2,000 and 3,000 feet, 
though pilots can take their passengers as high as 5,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Balloonists can also bring their passengers within just a few feet of the 
ground, navigating their 70-foot-tall vehicles along hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
To steer the balloon, pilots track the direction of the wind before the flight 
with the help of local weather services, and by launching small helium balloons 
called pibals. The wind shifts at different altitudes, so pilots can dip or 
soar to change the direction their balloons are traveling. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't steer (a balloon) as much as you can steer a plane or a helicopter, 
of course, but it is surprising the degree of control you do have," Slaughter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Since balloons travel with the wind, the breeze does not blow in passengers' 
faces and the gondola does not swing. As a result, there is very little sense 
of motion, even though the balloon is moving at average speeds of between 5 and 
15 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter's passengers on this particular Friday include Tricia Taylor, a 
42-year-old secretary whose husband, Mel, took her on the flight as a birthday 
present. The fact that it was Friday the 13th seemed to trouble Mel, a Navy 
lieutenant commander who says he prefers deep seas to open skies. 
</P>
<P>
"When he told me he was going up with me I about fell over," Tricia said, 
watching Mel pace nervously. Although this will be Tricia's second balloon 
ride, it's Mel's first. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter says that up to a third of his passengers are nervous before a 
flight, though they usually calm down once they see how serene ballooning is. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever had anybody freak out up here?" Tricia asked as the balloon 
began its ascent. 
</P>
<P>
"Only the pilot," Slaughter said. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature in the air is about the same as the temperature back on terra 
firma. In fact, the propane burner, which keeps the balloon aloft, is so hot 
that passengers actually may be warmer in the air than they are back on the 
ground. However, the temperature on the ground after sunset can get quite cool, 
so balloonists generally recommend that their passengers wear layered clothing. 
</P>
<P>
The entire trip is spent standing up in the gondola, so comfortable shoes are a 
must. Transportation to the launch areas and from the landing sites -- which 
could be several miles apart -- is provided by the balloon company. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the flights themselves, most Del Mar balloon companies provide 
complementary Champagne after the landing, buffet or picnic-style hors 
d'oeuvres or meals, photographs, pins and flight certificates. The exact 
combination of these and other goodies depends on the company. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the balloon companies require reservations, especially for flights on 
Saturday or Sunday evening. Friday flights are usually not as busy as other 
weekend evenings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAILPLANES 
</P>
<P>
On at least a few occasions, passengers have lost their cookies in Bret 
Willat's sailplanes. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, Willat and his pilots can adjust their flight plans to 
accommodate the interests of their passengers, not to mention their passengers' 
stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
Willat's company, Sky Sailing, is based at the Warner Springs Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We tailor our ride to the individual," Willat said. "For the person who's more 
nervous, we tone it down." 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen of Willat's passengers have used Sky Sailing's two-person 
flights as opportunities to propose marriage to their dates, including one 
passenger who had Willat's staff unroll a huge banner on the runway, popping 
the question in 3 1/2-foot-high painted letters. 
</P>
<P>
For those passengers who feel more adventurous than amorous, Sky Sailing 
flights can be a roller-coaster ride that would make Disneyland's best 
engineers drool, Willat said. 
</P>
<P>
Several two-person scenic flights are available, including a 20-minute flight 
over No Name Mountain for $68, and a 25-to 30-minute flight over Hot Springs 
Mountain for $98. A 35-to 40-minute, mile-high flight for two over Mount 
Palomar costs $138. 
</P>
<P>
For single passengers, a 20-to 30-minute scenic flight in one of the company's 
modern, hi-performance sailplanes costs between $45 and $62. A 35-to 40-minute, 
mile-high flight for one costs $78. 
</P>
<P>
For an additional $3, customers interested in the single-passenger flights can 
receive some instruction on the ground before takeoff and actually do most of 
the flying themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to admit this, but flying is very simple," Willat said. 
</P>
<P>
Sailplanes, or gliders, are engineless aircraft that are carried high into the 
air behind small, propeller tow planes. 
</P>
<P>
A 200-foot-long, 1/4-inch-thick polypropylene rope connects the two aircraft. 
When the rope is released, it makes a popping noise loud enough to scare an 
unprepared passenger out of his or her seat and through the glider's 
bubble-shaped canopy. 
</P>
<P>
Willat's aircraft have a glide ratio of more than 20 to 1. In other words, they 
can travel more than 20 miles for every mile of altitude. 
</P>
<P>
Sailplanes do not need wind to fly. Instead, they ride on the rising air 
currents generated by Warner Springs' sun-baked ground. Pilots also use the 
lift created when wind and shifting air masses run into nearby mountains. "As 
long as there's air and as long as there's gravity, we can fly," Willat said. 
</P>
<P>
But intense sun in the middle of the day can make the afternoon air somewhat 
unstable and bumpy. Passengers who think they would prefer a smoother ride 
should plan on flying either in the early morning or late afternoon, Willat 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the ultimate E Ticket ride," he added. "Our pilots get paid, but if we 
charged them they'd still do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HELICOPTERS 
</P>
<P>
Flight Trails Helicopter Inc., operating out of Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, 
often provides impromptu tours for people who decide on the spur of the moment 
they want to go flying. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of people who call and say, 'Gee, it's a beautiful day, I'd 
really like to take a ride up and down the coast,"' said Tish Krebs, office 
manager of Flight Trails. "We're pretty flexible here. Depending on the time of 
day, we can take anyone on tours all over San Diego County." 
</P>
<P>
Flight Trails averages about 50 helicopter pleasure rides a month and has a 
fleet of five copters available, Krebs said. 
</P>
<P>
The firm offers 30-minute tours of North County for $95 for one to two 
passengers; $200 a half-hour for three passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Also offering flights over North County is Corporate Helicopters, based at 
Lindbergh Field. Owner-operator Ivor Shier said that for the past several 
months he has been using the company's fleet of two, four and six-passenger 
helicopters to carry non-business passengers. 
</P>
<P>
According to Shier, Corporate Helicopters has been carrying an average of 40 
aerial tourists a month. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-minute tour of the San Diego area costs $65 a person. For those interested 
in longer flights, Shier offers a 45- to 60-minute tour that can include the 
North County coastline for $120 a person. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Corporate Helicopters regularly offers 40-minute sunset flights to 
the Del Mar and Torrey Pines areas. At $135 a person, the flight includes 
Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my office," said Shier, 38, climbing into the cockpit of his 1989 Bell 
Jetranger helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Shier flies his helicopter north from Lindbergh along Interstate 5, about 100 
feet below an approaching cloud bank and 1,100 feet above the ground. "It's 
kind of fun to dodge around the clouds," he said, turning the helicopter west 
at La Jolla and dropping down several hundred feet. At the coast, he turns 
south. 
</P>
<P>
Through the glass by the pedals in front of them, passengers can see surfers, 
swimmers and sailors gazing up at them like fish peering up through the deck of 
a glass-bottom boat. 
</P>
<P>
At an average speed of between 80 and 100 m.p.h., a helicopter tour is about as 
smooth as the ride in a small propeller plane. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great, It's beautiful," exclaimed passenger Michelle Dormish, 24, of La 
Jolla. "There's no better way to see San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AIRPLANES 
</P>
<P>
For those who prefer more traditional forms of aviation, Montgomery Field-based 
California Wings offers sky tours in two different types of classic airplanes. 
One is a vintage twin-engine, eight-passenger Beech 18. The other is one of 
only two Bushmaster 2000 Tri-Motors, a modified version of the old Ford 4-ATs 
and 5-ATs that revolutionized passenger air travel in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
The Tri-Motor can accommodate up to 12 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
California Wings flies two, regularly-scheduled $49 tours covering an area from 
Del Mar south every Saturday and Sunday. The company can provide additional 
flight times for six passengers or more if booked in advance. A tour of the 
entire North County coastline for six passengers is also available out of 
Palomar Airport. 
</P>
<P>
A newcomer to the North County skies is Rhumb Line, a company at Palomar 
Airport that provides scenic flights and sunset cruises. In business only two 
months, Rhumb Line offers tours for $35 per half-hour per couple. With a fleet 
of seven single and twin engine planes, flights are available by reservation 
only. 
</P>
<P>
"We're good for first dates, for couples, or even for businesses who want to 
give us out as a prize to an employee or for promotional use," said Colette 
Laurain, manager and part-owner of Rhumb Line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HANG GLIDERS 
</P>
<P>
It's possible to experience a ride in a hang glider without actually having to 
jump off a cliff by yourself. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrey Pines Flight Park offers tandem rides on a two-person hang glider 
with one of their instructors. The rides over Blacks Beach, which cost $75, 
last about 20 to 30 minutes, plus another 20 minutes of instruction on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
The Flight Park is open every day from sunrise to sunset, though the tandem 
rides are only offered when the winds in the area are from the west at 10 to 15 
m.p.h.

IRAQ, KUWAIT AGREE TO TALKS IN GULF DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq and Kuwait have agreed to hold direct talks this weekend to try to resolve 
their taut confrontation peacefully, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak announced 
Wednesday in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who undertook a whirlwind tour of both Persian Gulf neighbors Tuesday 
to mediate the oil-policy and territorial dispute, told reporters that Iraqi 
and Kuwaiti representatives will meet Saturday or Sunday in Jidda, Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
He said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose official newspaper Wednesday 
accused the United States of interference in the conflict, has agreed to stop 
his verbal attacks on Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also urged the United States, which on Tuesday announced "short-notice" 
naval maneuvers for American warships in the gulf, not to escalate the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Official Iraqi radio said Wednesday that Hussein has summoned U.S. Ambassador 
April C. Glaspie for talks, but no details were released. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Iraq kept up its martial drumbeat, with the government 
daily Al Jumhuriya charging that Kuwait "is implementing an American-Zionist 
plot to show that America is playing the role of protector in the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
"Let Sabah al Ahmed al Sabah (the Kuwaiti foreign minister) and his American 
masters in the White House know that Iraq will not succumb and will not let 
anyone encroach upon its rights," the newspaper declared. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in an apparent endorsement of direct talks with Iraq, the Kuwaiti prime 
minister, Sheik Saad al Abdullah al Sabah, reportedly told a Kuwait news 
conference that "Kuwait wanted and still wants . . . to meet our brothers in 
Iraq to reach an understanding in a brotherly atmosphere on a formula which 
will serve the interest" of both countries. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwaiti news agency, Saad said, "We will consider what 
happened a cloud which will soon go." 
</P>
<P>
Since last weekend, when it deployed two armored divisions of 30,000 troops, 
backed by an estimated 200 tanks, along its disputed border with Kuwait, 
Hussein's regime in Baghdad had raised the level of rhetorical firepower. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, the Iraqi government paper declared Wednesday, "should be aware that 
those who are threatening the interests of the Arab nation and conspire against 
it will not be protected by foreigners." It added: "This is the Iraq of Saddam 
Hussein. This should be enough." 
</P>
<P>
Even discounting the hot flourishes of rhetoric, the Iraqi regime has appeared 
determined to get its way in the rift with Kuwait, a rift that Hussein 
triggered two weeks ago in a speech celebrating the 11th anniversary of his 
rise to power. 
</P>
<P>
He and his ministers have accused the oil-rich sheikdom, in tandem with the 
United Arab Emirates, of driving down world oil prices by overproduction, 
thereby denying Baghdad billions of dollars in revenue -- $14 billion in 1990 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that got 
under way Wednesday in Geneva, Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim Chalabi is 
expected to demand a target price of $25 a barrel, $7 above the current 
unachieved target. Strict restraints on production would be imposed to drive up 
the price under the Iraqi plan. (Story, D1.) 
</P>
<P>
Most Middle East analysts have insisted that the confrontation is basically 
about money: Iraq is desperately short of hard-currency reserves to rebuild its 
war-damaged economy and can boost them only with oil revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is also is heavily in debt to Western bankers, who are reluctant to make 
new loans until payments are made on the old ones. Meanwhile, Baghdad owes an 
estimated $40 billion to Arab oil countries, which supported its war against 
Iran. Hussein wants those debts erased, insisting that Iraqis died to protect 
the oil states from Iran's armies. 
</P>
<P>
The analysts say they still doubt that Iraq would go to war with an Arab 
neighbor to resolve the conflict. But the crisis has now taken on overtones of 
pride and politics that may make it difficult to defuse. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Mubarak had pressed his formula for easing tensions and discussing 
a solution. Mubarak received "positive responses for his good offices from the 
Iraqi and the Kuwaiti leaderships," the president's top Arab affairs adviser, 
Osama al Baz, said Wednesday in an interview with Egypt's official news agency. 
</P>
<P>
The adviser said "elements of progress" had "crystallized" during Mubarak's 
one-day circuit of Baghdad, Kuwait and Jidda, where he met with Saudi Arabia's 
King Fahd. In Kuwait, Reuters news agency quoted unidentified Arab diplomats as 
saying Hussein already has given Mubarak assurances that his army will not 
cross into Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Cairo, Mubarak had been working on a four-point plan 
that calls for Egyptian mediation; talks among the Iraqi, Kuwaiti and Egyptian 
foreign ministers; the renouncing of the military confrontation, and an end to 
the propaganda campaigns in the Iraqi and Kuwaiti press. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad, meanwhile, had insisted on face-to-face talks with the Kuwaitis alone, 
covering all elements of oil and their longstanding border disputes. It has 
accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of carrying out an alleged American 
plan to bleed Iraq economically and has threatened direct action -- presumably 
military -- to block it. 
</P>
<P>
The small-scale U.S. maneuvers with Emirates naval units in the gulf were seen 
in Baghdad as a challenge to its professed Arab leadership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Kuwait have never agreed on the demarcation of their border since 
Kuwait gained its independence from Britain in 1961. Shortly afterward, Iraq 
claimed sovereignty over Kuwait, and the Kuwaitis asked Britain for assistance. 
Britain sent in paratroopers. Later, they were replaced by an Arab League force 
led by Egypt, which acted as a buffer between the two countries until tensions 
eased in 1963. In the latest dispute, Iraq sent thousands of troops to its 
100-mile-long southern border with Kuwait after accusing it of violating 
oil-production quotas and stealing oil. Baghdad's interest in Kuwaiti territory 
stems, in part, from a desire for more coastline on the Persian Gulf, which 
would make it easier for Iraq to export its oil.

STATE FORCED TO SHIFT FUNDS AS DEBTS MOUNT 
</P>

SACRAMENTO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California fiscal experts continued struggling with a treasury running dry 
Wednesday as they shifted funds to meet mounting debts and prepared to borrow 
$1 billion at premium interest rates as soon as the budget crisis is solved. 
</P>
<P>
But the political stalemate that has left the state without a budget for 26 
days continued, as Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders met behind 
closed doors in an attempt to find a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Controller Gray Davis and Treasurer Thomas J. Hayes reported that in a search 
to squeeze every conceivable source for extra cash, they found a school 
construction cookie jar containing $217 million that could be loaned to the 
nearly empty treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Davis indicated that together with existing resources the loan could be made 
available for meeting the end-of-month $500-million state labor force payroll 
or for other payments that courts may order. 
</P>
<P>
Once the immediate crisis is past and a new budget is in place, Hayes said the 
emergency $1 billion loan will be necessary "in all likelihood" to quickly pay 
overdue bills and help replenish a battered treasury. A budget must be enacted 
before the state can either spend or borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
Because funds will be needed very quickly once a budget is approved, Hayes told 
The Times he now has no choice but to issue taxable notes that carry 
signficiantly higher interest rates than the tax exempt instruments usually 
issued by the treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Saying he regretted the extra expense, Hays said that nonetheless "we are fully 
equippped and ready to do that." He estimated the interest rate at 8% to 8.5% 
compared to 6% for the tax free fiscal instruments. 
</P>
<P>
An assistant to Hayes, Russ Gould, said a single day's interest on a $1 billion 
loan at 8.5% would total $236,000 compared with $166,000 a day at 6% interest. 
</P>
<P>
Gould said, however, that the higher rate loan probably would be in effect for 
only a couple of days to cover the urgent payments from the treasury and that 
the loan then would be paid off and converted into a tax exempt note at 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the best of fiscal times, the state borrows money from outside lenders 
a month or so after the budget is enacted because revenue expenses rise and 
revenues fall during July. Routinely, the state issues tax exempt "revenue 
anticipation notes" at about 6% interest to fill the gap. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency $1 billion loan this time, said Hayes and Davis, is made 
necessary by the extraordinarily long delay in enacting a state budget. Both 
said the usual revenue anticipation note loans of about $3.5 billion still will 
be made. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, just back from consultations on Wall Street, again warned Deukmejian and 
legislative leaders that further delay in enacting a state budget threatens to 
jeopardize the state's platinum-plated credit rating and could cost taxpayers 
additional millions "next year and for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter, he told them that all three eastern financial houses that rate 
California bonds are "uneasy" about the long budget haitus and "the longer we 
delay, the higher the probablilty of an adverse action on their part." 
</P>
<P>
The three rating houses, Standard and Poors, Moodys and Fitch, have rated 
California's credit at the highest level, or AAA. Any down grading of the 
rating, would add interest costs to the state's borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes called on the lawmakers and Deukmejian to enact a budget "as quickly as 
possible and demonstrate the fact that we continue to be fiscally responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fiscal squeeze for state agencies got a little tighter Wednesday 
when the Deukmejian's Department of Finance warned that it is illegal for them 
to use departmental revolving funds to pay for operating expenses during the 
budget stalemate, according to a memorandum obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at several state departments said that the funds were their last 
resort to pay for travel, equipment and other day-to-day expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The revolving funds were terminated by a terse internal memorandum issued by 
the Finance Department. "Budget analysts should contact their departments to 
remind them it is illegal to write (revolving fund) checks for current year 
expenditures during this time without a budget. We believe many agencies are 
continuing to illegally write (revolving fund) checks," the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, for example, now has $200,000 left over in the fund, 
department spokeswoman said. The Department of Social Services has $1 million, 
which it was using for such expenses as sending inspectors to investigate 
complaints about community care facilities, employee training seminars, and 
salary advances, said spokeswoman Kathleen Norris. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health Services had $4 million left over at the beginning of 
July. Now its fund is down to $800,000 after the department spent $410,000 on 
Monday to mail eligibility cards to thousands of Medi-Cal recipients. 
</P>
<P>
"That was our last source of funds and with the latest interpretation of the 
law from Finance we can't even spend that money," said spokesman Norman S. 
Hartman. "Those people who travel frequently and expect to get reimbursed are 
not longer going to be able to do so."

CITIZENS SEEK AN ESCAPE HATCH WHEN THE BRITISH COLONY REVERTS TO CHINESE 
CONTROL. PACIFIC COUNTRIES ARE CASHING IN BY SELLING CITIZENSHIP.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Hong Kong residents desperate to flee before China takes over in 1997, the 
Federal Republic of Corterra sounded perfect. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny Pacific island nation was described as lying between Tahiti and 
Hawaii, with 80,000 citizens who enjoy democratic government, a British-style 
legal system and no income tax. Best of all, a newspaper ad here boasted, 
passports are bargain-priced at only $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
Three local businessmen quickly paid the $5,000 application fee. Then they 
discovered the catch. 
</P>
<P>
"To the best of our knowledge, Corterra does not exist," said Ben W. Munford, 
detective chief superintendent. "No such country. No such place." 
</P>
<P>
But plenty of real Pacific countries, from Tonga to Tahiti, from Saipan to 
Fiji, are cashing in on the growing uncertainty about Hong Kong's future by 
selling citizenship, usually for fees or investments of less than $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen other places are also peddling low-price passports, from the 
Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean to the Republic of Transkei in 
southern Africa, and from Malta in the Mediterranean to Mauritius in the Indian 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
This is the seedy side of the brain drain, the much-publicized departure of 
tens of thousands of Hong Kong tycoons, entrepreneurs and professionals for the 
United States, Australia and Canada. People who are too poor, too poorly 
educated or without the family ties needed to qualify for the country of their 
choice often settle for any place that will accept them. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone I know is leaving," said Robert C. Broadfoot, managing director of 
Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy, a business consulting group. "They 
tend to go wherever they can get in." 
</P>
<P>
Big or small, the attraction is the same. Many want an escape hatch when this 
British colony and Asian financial center reverts to Chinese control in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the last day to register for naturalization in time to leave Hong 
Kong as British citizens, thousands of residents jammed the Immigration 
Department offices. 
</P>
<P>
But even for those willing to stay after 1997, a passport -- any passport -- 
offers insurance in case Beijing's Communist leaders crack down on civil 
rights, capitalism and the freebooter lifestyle here. 
</P>
<P>
"People are very nervous," said Serge Pun, a developer who has moved his family 
and most of his business to Thailand. "There's no solution that can really put 
people's minds at ease." 
</P>
<P>
That's fine with Singapore, which has long been a regional rival. Singapore has 
approved passports for nearly 22,000 Hong Kong residents in the past year. To 
qualify, applicants must be either professionals or skilled technicians, 
computer programmers and the like. More than 200,000 have applied. 
</P>
<P>
"The scheme is mutually beneficial," said Chi Choo, a Singapore Commission 
official here. "They are given five years to decide. They can stay and work for 
Hong Kong prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
Other countries aren't so strict. 
</P>
<P>
Take Tonga. Last fall, King Taufaahau Topou IV agreed to sell 1,000 passports 
from his tiny Polynesian country. So-called emigration consultants, lawyers and 
travel agencies openly competed to sell the Tongan passports, with prices 
ranging from $16,500 to $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that the special passport didn't get you very far. A Chinese 
man who bought one reportedly tried to commit suicide in Tonga in February 
after learning that he couldn't return to Hong Kong or even visit Australia. 
</P>
<P>
One man authorized to sell the passports in Hong Kong skipped town leaving 
heavy debts behind, the police said, apparently to return to his original 
business in Australia: selling used cars. 
</P>
<P>
Tonga's honorary consul here, Hung Siu-kai, says those problems are over. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new scheme, applicants must lease land in Tonga for 20 years. It costs 
$17,500 for an individual or $25,000 for a family, including handling fees, and 
the passports are issued in four to five weeks, Hung said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had more than 500 applications," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently no one has applied to the Republic of the Marshall Islands, a 
country of far-flung atolls known for World War II battles and scores of U.S. 
atom bomb tests. The legislature last year approved the sale of 3,000 passports 
for $250,000 each. But the law says the new citizens may not "own land or 
possess any customary or traditional rights," such as voting. 
</P>
<P>
No such problems taint Tahiti. The crown jewel of French Polynesia was 
front-page news in Hong Kong when a 17-man government delegation arrived to 
promote Papeete, its capital, and to dangle French passports in exchange for 
investments of at least $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
New Caledonia and Fiji invite investors with $77,000. So does the Philippines, 
where developers are building a "Hong Kong Village" of posh homes in a Manila 
suburb to attract wealthy businessmen. More than 500 immigrant visas have 
already been issued, Philippine officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Even tiny Tuvalu, a southwest Pacific nation of nine islands, none rising more 
than 15 feet above sea level, is besieged. 
</P>
<P>
"I get inquiries every day from people who are interested in getting a Tuvalu 
passport," said Puran Sundarjee, honorary consul of one of the world's smallest 
and most remote countries. "Most have never heard of Tuvalu. I have to tell 
them we are 90% coral and the rest is ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Farther afield, the tiny British Crown Colony of the Turks and Caicos Islands, 
eight inhabited islands east of the Bahamas, has advertised itself here as "a 
tropical paradise on the same latitude as Hong Kong," offering "wide-open 
opportunities to immigrate and/or invest." Minimum capital for a passport: 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents push properties in Portugal and Ireland, where residence can 
lead to citizenship. Representatives of Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela and 
Uruguay offer passports for a price. So did Panama, Belize and Paraguay until 
recent changes in their governments. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still lots of inquiries," said a Paraguayan representative, Kong 
Chen. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Transkei. A recent ad in the South China Morning Post offered Hong 
Kong investors and their families "immediate citizenship" in "tranquil 
Transkei," and an "opportunity to start a new life in one of the world's 
friendliest communities." 
</P>
<P>
The ad doesn't say that Transkei is one of South Africa's 10 tribal homelands 
and is ruled by a military government. Pretoria's white rulers consider 
Transkei an independent state, but almost no other government recognizes it as 
such. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the stigma is that the Transkei passport is the same as South 
Africa's," conceded representative Robert Trott, an Australian. "No travel 
benefits. You can go to Taiwan and Hong Kong. That's about it, really." 
</P>
<P>
The duty-free port and export processing zone promised in the ad does not exist 
yet, Trott said. But he added that about 60 people have called about the 
year-old ad campaign, and "two or three have actually gone." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's legal -- more than one can say about some of the activity in 
selling citizenship. Panama's new government has accused its former Hong Kong 
consul-general of illegally selling passports. And a Venezuelan diplomat was 
arrested here recently after more than 1,000 Hong Kong Chinese had entered 
Venezuela in an $11-million immigration scam. 
</P>
<P>
At least they got somewhere. The police have investigated 19 emigration scams 
in as many months in which jittery Hong Kong residents were parted from their 
money and went nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
One man took in $700,000 in fees for schools in Canada, Australia and New 
Zealand. Students were promised visas. They were swindled. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people were nervous and easy prey" after Chinese troops shot 
dissident students in Beijing in June of 1989, said Munford, the police 
superintendent. "I think confidence men and tricksters the world over sensed 
that and took advantage of gullible people." 
</P>
<P>
Munford's men cracked the Federal Republic of Corterra caper last December 
after they spotted an ad in a Chinese-language newspaper. Their suspicions grew 
when the so-called Corterra consul confided that the Pacific paradise had 
another name. 
</P>
<P>
"He claimed it was also recognized as the United Kingdom of Coral Land," 
Munford said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made. The three victims were too embarrassed to complain.

DISCOVERY OF HORMONE HOLDS PROMISE

<P>
California and Utah researchers have succeeded in preventing one form of kidney 
disease in rats, potentially opening the door to prevention of kidney failure 
in humans. 
</P>
<P>
The disease, called glomerulonephritis, is one of the most common causes of 
chronic kidney failure, afflicting as many as 100,000 Americans each year. Once 
the kidney fails, the patients must either receive a transplant or remain on 
dialysis for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the University of Utah and the La Jolla Cancer Research 
Foundation report today in the British journal Nature that glomerulonephritis 
in the rats is caused by excess concentrations of a hormone called transforming 
growth factor-beta (TGF-B). 
</P>
<P>
They found that specialized antibodies can be used to remove the hormone from 
the blood of the animals and thereby prevent the onset of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
But Utah nephrologist Wayne Border cautioned that it could be many years before 
the proposed therapy could be used in humans. For one thing, the recently 
discovered TGF-B has not yet been linked to kidney disease in humans -- 
although, he said, "it would be incredible if it weren't also playing an 
important role in man." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have not shown in animal experiments that the therapy can halt the 
disease process once it has begun, he added, but test-tube experiments indicate 
that it can. 
</P>
<P>
"This important observation opens the door" to the treatment of humans, said 
Dr. Saulo Klahr of the Washington University School of Medicine, president of 
the National Kidney Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Healthy kidneys act as filters that remove both excess water and cellular 
wastes from blood. When the kidneys fail, an individual will die of poisoning 
within days unless those wastes are removed artificially by dialysis. More than 
130,000 Americans undergo dialysis routinely to maintain their health. 
</P>
<P>
The filtering is carried out within the kidney by small units called glomeruli. 
Kidney disease occurs when the glomeruli become clogged by abnormally large 
amounts of a material called "extracellular matrix," a fibrous meshwork of 
proteins and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
This scarring and clogging can be produced by diabetes, high blood pressure and 
glomerulonephritis, in which the immune system attacks the glomeruli, often as 
the aftereffect of an infection. Physicians do not know the precise mechanism 
by which the damage occurs, and no effective therapy exists to prevent or halt 
the scarring. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists study glomerulonephritis in rats by injecting a protein that attacks 
cells in the glomeruli, damaging them and inducing the formation of 
extracellular matrix. Studying this phenomenon, Border and cellular biologist 
Erkki Ruoslahti of the La Jolla foundation discovered that the formation of the 
matrix was triggered by TGF-B, which was released when the kidney cells were 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers then prepared antibodies to the hormone and injected them into 
15 rats at the same time they injected the protein that produces the disease. 
The rats also received daily injections of the the anti-TGF-B antibody on each 
of the next six days. 
</P>
<P>
After seven days, the researchers examined the rats that received the 
anti-TGF-B antibody and found that their glomeruli were normal, Border said, 
indicating that disease had been prevented. In contrast, the glomeruli of 15 
control animals who were given only the disease-producing protein showed marked 
scarring and inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there is no evidence that TGF-B plays a similar role in 
glomerulonephritis in humans. "But our paper is the first to describe a link to 
TGF-B in kidney disease," Border said, "so no one has looked for it before." 
</P>
<P>
They are now collecting human blood samples to look for the hormone, he said, 
and they are also conducting studies to determine if the anti-TGF-B antibodies 
can halt the disease process once it has been initiated. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ruoslahti and his colleagues in La Jolla have discovered a naturally 
occurring protein, called decorin, that in the test tube binds to TGF-B and 
neutralizes its activity in much the same way that the antibody does. 
Researchers at Telios Pharmaceuticals of La Jolla are developing techniques to 
produce large quantities of decorin in order to study its potential therapeutic 
use. 
</P>
<P>
The research may have other applications as well, Ruoslahti said. TGF-B may be 
involved in other diseases where excess scarring occurs, such as lung disease, 
and it may play a role in the process by which cancer cells from a tumor 
metastasize, invading other parts of the body. Developing the ability to 
interfere with TGF-B, he said, might thus have therapeutic potential in those 
disorders as well. 
</P>

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Kidney disease, caused by diabetes, high blood pressure and glomerulonephritis, 
affects as many as 100,000 Americans a year. The only treatments are dialysis 
and kidney transplants. The number of Americans on dialysis has been growing 
about 10% a year, reaching 130,000 in 1989 and costing the federal government 
about $2.5 billion a year.

<P>
Ruth Watters pulled a tiny, sparkling stone out of a paper bag and held it up 
in the intense sunlight, asking for a second opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just walking alone and I saw it on the ground," Watters, of St. 
Petersburg, Fla., said. "Does that look like a diamond to you?" 
</P>
<P>
Only here, at Crater of Diamonds State Park, would that question not sound 
foolish. The park, tucked into the lush pine forests of southwest Arkansas, is 
the only place in North America ever to produce gem-quality diamonds and the 
only diamond mine in the world that allows the public to find and keep the 
gems. 
</P>
<P>
For $3 (or $1.50 for children), visitors may dig and scratch at about 35 acres 
of gray volcanic soil and dream of finding a stone that will dwarf "Uncle Sam," 
the 40.23-carat record-holder found here in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
Already on this day, two lucky prospectors had found diamonds, bringing this 
year's count to 533. But the fun has been tempered by controversy lately, ever 
since the state decided it might sell the park's most productive sections to 
private mining concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, diamond-mining interests persuaded the Arkansas Department of 
Parks and Tourism to initiate testing to determine the size and shape of the 
diamond-bearing ore deposit. Four potential bidders put up $87,500 each to pay 
for the testing, and a Tennessee company under contract to the state began 
drilling on July 8 with an apparatus that resembles an oil-well drill rig. 
</P>
<P>
The test drilling prompted a federal lawsuit this year by conservationists who 
contend the tests are a prelude to full-scale commercial mining at the park. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be like shooting the last whooping crane or killing the last bald 
eagle," said Terry Horton, director of the environmentalist Arkansas Wildlife 
Federation, which is among the suit's plaintiffs. "It's so unique that the very 
idea of turning it into a commercial mining operation is vulgar." 
</P>
<P>
Since the state bought what had been a privately owned mine in 1972 for 
$750,000, about 14,000 diamonds have been plucked from it. The 889-acre park 
averages 700 visitors a day. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Gov. Bill Clinton appointed a task force to study the idea of 
commercializing the park. That led to the Department of Parks and Tourism's 
decision last year to give testing the go-ahead. The federal Department of the 
Interior, which granted the state $720,000 of the purchase price 18 years ago, 
initially opposed the drilling but changed its stance last July, although 
Clinton now says he is against commercialization. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several diamond-mining companies contended that commercial 
operation would be a boon to economically depressed Murfreesboro and its 1,900 
residents. A spokesman for Arkansas investors interested in a private mine said 
that such an operation would create 400 permanent jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal drawn up by the task force two years ago set aside for the mining 
company the entire 35-acre field that the state now plows regularly for public 
mining and envisioned a huge pit reaching hundreds of feet deep. The state 
would keep part of the park for public use, but Jim Cannon, the park 
superintendent, said the rest of the park's ore deposits are of a different 
type that is too hard to plow. Opponents say commercialization would leave the 
public to scour the park's least productive areas and destroy the 
diamond-hunting experience. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists' lawsuit contends that converting the public land to 
private use is illegal. The federal Land and Water Conservation Fund Act 
prohibits such conversion unless the lands taken away are replaced with other 
lands of like value and use. 
</P>
<P>
But the Interior Department allowed testing a year ago as a temporary 
non-conforming use. U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright thus far has 
allowed the first phase of testing to continue but has hinted that she might 
rule on a permanent injunction by Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, visitors continue to scan the surface and dig as usual, while the 
drill rig hums away.

BUSH LETS SPACE AGENCY REMAIN IN ORBIT, SCRUBS EXTERNAL REVIEW

<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has quietly survived a crisis 
that insiders say could have devastated the agency, destroying morale and 
driving out its most talented managers and scientists. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for NASA came when both congressional critics and the staff of the 
National Space Council, which is chaired by Vice President Dan Quayle, 
privately urged a sweeping investigation of alleged mismanagement at the space 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush last week forcefully rejected the calls. Instead of ordering an 
outside investigation of NASA's current problems with the space shuttle, the 
Hubble telescope and the proposed orbiting space station, Bush took a far more 
modest step: He asked NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly to appoint a panel to 
review the agency's long-term goals. 
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND: Speculation that a major investigation was forthcoming had been fed 
by a recent story in the weekly trade newspaper Space News. According to the 
article, Bush planned a massive NASA reorganization and a fundamental review of 
the nation's space priorities. The article also said that the President blamed 
current NASA management -- rather than faulty technology or overambitious goals 
-- for the agency's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
The story was broadcast by two television networks, which also reported that 
Truly was considering resigning over the apparent vote of no confidence by the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
NASA officials were quickly assured by the White House that the story was 
groundless. NASA executives became convinced that the tale originated with the 
staff of the National Space Council, which has clashed with senior NASA 
managers over who should have primacy in setting Administration space policy. 
</P>
<P>
The space council is an interagency group including Truly, several Cabinet 
members, Budget Director Richard G. Darman, White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. It is chaired by Quayle 
and has a staff of about a dozen professionals ensconced in the Old Executive 
Office Building adjacent to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only group to benefit; they were the perpetrator of a lot of this," 
said a senior NASA official, who insisted on anonymity. "They're searching 
desperately for a role." 
</P>
<P>
That role could have been dramatically enhanced had the White House created -- 
under the aegis of the space council -- a new high-level panel to investigate 
all aspects of current and future NASA operations. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush realized that NASA couldn't stand another investigation" following the 
massive shake-up of the agency after the Challenger disaster, the senior NASA 
official said. "It would end the agency." 
</P>
<P>
ROLE DENIED: A space council official, who asked not to be named, insisted that 
the trade newspaper story had not originated there and that the council staff 
was not aiming to "take over" NASA. Despite disagreements with agency managers 
over a number of space programs, the official said, the space council supports 
the overall management of NASA. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle himself met with Truly last week and declared afterward that the 
Administration has "complete confidence" in the NASA administrator and 
dismissed rampant speculation that the White House would launch a major probe 
of the space agency. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no White House investigation of NASA, nor will there be one. We've 
got a challenge to move this space program forward, which we will," the vice 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Quayle announced that veteran aerospace executive Norman R. 
Augustine, former head of Martin Marietta Corp., had been selected to head an 
independent committee that will review the space agency and report to Truly. 
</P>
<P>
PROBLEMS MOUNT: Meanwhile, NASA's problems continued to mount -- a hydrogen 
leak delaying the planned flight of the Atlantis space shuttle was disclosed 
Wednesday -- and NASA critics were openly skeptical of the agency's planned 
internal review. 
</P>
<P>
"The real question now is, is the organization performing up to standards that 
could and should be expected? I feel it's not," said John Logsdon, director of 
the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University here. "They should 
be looking at the whole organization, its structure and way of doing business 
and whether they are appropriate for the missions proposed for the next decade 
and beyond."

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev moved personally Wednesday to halt mounting 
violence by armed bands in Armenia by ordering them disbanded and authorizing 
the police and KGB to seize their weapons if they are not surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
Armenians predicted that Gorbachev's decree could spark more bloodshed in their 
strife-weary land, but it showed Moscow's exasperation at what Soviet officials 
call the clear connivance of Armenian authorities with thousands of armed 
militants, considered by many in the Caucasus republic to be their best line of 
defense against ethnic attack. 
</P>
<P>
In Armenia, locked for 2 1/2 years in an often bloody territorial dispute with 
neighboring Azerbaijan, ethnic tensions have increasingly been accompanied by 
attacks on Soviet Interior Ministry troops and other agents of the central 
government, which many Armenians say are not the acts of nationalist bands but 
of common criminals. 
</P>
<P>
In one 48-hour period last week, three police posts in the capital of Yerevan 
were besieged and 10 pistols taken. About 60 armed men forced their way into a 
police station in the Talin area and ransacked it. In the Masiss district, 
gunmen hurled Molotov cocktails at a traffic police post and burned it to the 
ground, while 20 carloads of gunmen blockaded the headquarters of the Armenian 
Interior Ministry in Yerevan. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's presidential decree, carried by the official Tass news agency, 
showed that Moscow's tolerance for such acts has reached an end. He declared 
the units of armed irregulars illegal and ordered them disbanded within 15 
days. Members must hand over weapons, ammunition and explosives to police, said 
Gorbachev, who also had ordered Lithuanians to temporarily turn over their 
firearms when the Baltic republic declared independence in March. 
</P>
<P>
If the militants do not comply, police and KGB units are empowered to seize 
their arms. If the bands still "endanger the safety of the populace and the 
state," Interior Ministry troops and regular army detachments may be deployed 
to fight them. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet media have put the strength of the Armenian irregulars in the tens of 
thousands, and one lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova, has said they total from 
40,000 to 50,000 men. Some Armenians, however, say such numbers are a fantasy 
and that the groups have no more than 4,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
In May, more than 20 people were killed when gunmen clashed with troops in the 
southern republic. Guerrillas ambushed troops at Yerevan's railway station, and 
seven men died in the ensuing gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said it is time to halt the groups' "grave crimes" that have led to 
casualities among innocent people. He said criminals, draft-dodgers and 
deserters from the Soviet armed forces have been swelling their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
His decree unmistakably was motivated by the recent events in Armenia, although 
he did not refer specifically to the republic. The decree may be used, 
therefore, to combat armed militants in Kirghizia, Uzbekistan or other 
strife-torn Soviet regions. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Boris Smolny, first deputy commander of Interior Ministry troops, told 
Tass this month that Armenian authorities have given terrorists "a free hand, 
and instigate them to take more daring and cruel actions toward not only the 
police and troops but those compatriots who have changed their minds about 
illegitimate armed groups." 
</P>
<P>
However, there was disagreement in Armenia about the effects of Gorbachev's 
decree. 
</P>
<P>
Khovik Vassilian, chairman of the Aidak nationalist organization, said 
Gorbachev's action could whip up tensions even more. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation will be fraught with serious consequences, since it may lead to 
bloodshed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vassilian is one of many Armenians who deny that the kinds of illegal acts 
mentioned by Gorbachev's decree have anything to do with the self-defense 
units, which Armenians have dubbed fedayin, a word for "commando" that 
Vassilian said they have borrowed from the Turkish. 
</P>
<P>
"The fedayin are carrying out self-defense functions, and as a rule they never 
pose any problems," Vassilian said. "But some of the firearms have gotten into 
the hands of a dozen criminal groups, which use them when settling accounts." 
</P>
<P>
Martin Martirosyan, another Armenian activist, said, "Everything depends on 
what will be meant by the phrase 'illegal armed groups.' " He said the 
republic's Supreme Soviet, or legislature, will discuss whether to declare the 
fedayin a "republican army" because of the purported failure of Soviet troops 
and police to protect Armenians' lives and property. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for Armenians' apprehension at the results of Gorbachev's decree is 
that past uses of Soviet army and Interior Ministry troops to combat 
manifestations of nationalism in Transcaucasia have led to great bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
Troops armed with shovels and gas attacked pro-independence demonstrators in 
Georgia in April, 1989, and killed 19. In January, soldiers drove into the 
Azerbaijani capital of Baku to break a nationalist blockade, and as many as 200 
people were killed.

DIPLOMACY: 'NARROWING THE GAP' WITH MOSCOW ON THE CONFLICT IS REPORTED IN

The Bush Administration denied a report Wednesday that the United States and 
the Soviet Union have reached an agreement on settling the war in Afghanistan, 
but officials pointed to significant progress in resolving the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
A television broadcast saying that a deal was completed is a "product of the 
rumor mill," said Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who is traveling in 
Asia and will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in 
Irkutsk next week. 
</P>
<P>
But Administration officials reported that the two sides are nearing an 
agreement to end the 10-year-old war, one of the last regional conflicts to 
divide the superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're narrowing the gap," one official said. "We're not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials in Washington confirmed that the framework of an 
agreement has emerged. The proposal under discussion calls for Soviet-backed 
Afghan President Najibullah to cede power to an interim government that would 
oversee national elections. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed that Najibullah would be 
allowed to run for office, but the two sides differ over what role he should 
play in an interim government. 
</P>
<P>
"Najibullah is the sticking point," an Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have insisted that Najibullah hold at least a ceremonial post 
during the transition, but the United States and the U.S.-backed Afghan 
resistance have balked. They express concern that if Najibullah keeps a foot in 
the interim government, he will retain control over the Afghan secret police 
and may be able to influence elections. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides have agreed that the United Nations should play a major role in 
establishing an interim government and conducting elections, the official said. 
The elections may be conducted according to traditional Afghan customs, he 
said, using tribal councils or shuras. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to dictate what form the elections should take," the 
Administration official said. The important thing is that "neither side would 
be able to intimidate or control this interim body." 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear whether the United States would continue to support the 
moujahedeen during the transition period, either with military or humanitarian 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Congress appropriated $70 million in humanitarian aid for the Afghan 
resistance, but covert aid in fiscal 1990 is estimated at $280 million. 
Congress must decide before the end of September whether to appropriate new 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the rebel resistance in Congress said that, although they welcome 
the prospect of a settlement that would remove Najibullah from power, they 
would like to see U.S. support continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is critical to maintain the support in full measure while the 
negotiations are going on," said Sen. Gordon Humphrey (R-N.H.), one of the 
moujahedeen's strongest backers. "The last thing you do is pull the rug out 
from under your allies." 
</P>
<P>
David Isby, a spokesman for the Committee for a Free Afghanistan, said that the 
moujahedeen "are of two minds" about the possible agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is terribly sick of the war and wants it to stop," Isby said. "But 
there is a general fear that an agreement may be concluded without their 
participation." 
</P>
<P>
Isby added that although the Administration has consulted with the rebels about 
the terms of a possible settlement, the moujahedeen leaders still believe that 
the two sides are negotiating "over their heads." 
</P>
<P>
"Their voices have been heard, but they may not have been listened to," Isby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Remaining issues may be resolved at the upcoming meeting between Baker and 
Shevardnadze.

Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, in a surprise offer of reconciliation to 
his political foes, announced Wednesday the release of all political prisoners 
and agreed to postpone a referendum on multi-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sending a strong message of love to those who are insulting me and my 
colleagues to stop doing that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The referendum previously set for Oct. 17 this year would be put off until Aug. 
13, 1991, he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We must start afresh and hence the need for forgiveness, the need to come 
together again," Kaunda said as he announced the release of men jailed and 
detained for plotting to overthrow him at different periods during his 26-year 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Kaunda has shown no sign of making concessions to opponents calling 
for a multi-party political system, labeling them misfits, malcontents and drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Multi-party advocates had demanded a postponement of the referendum, saying 
millions of Zambians would be disenfranchised unless the electoral register was 
updated. 
</P>
<P>
Among the political prisoners released is Lt. Mwamba Luchembe, the man who 
briefly took over Zambia Radio to broadcast news of a non-existent military 
takeover last month.

LIBERIAN REBELS ATTACK AIRFIELD IN CAPITAL; DOE REFUSES TO YIELD

<TEXT>
<P>
Liberian rebels closing in on the final stronghold of President Samuel K. Doe 
waded across a swamp Wednesday to attack Monrovia's Spriggs-Payne airfield, the 
capital's last transportation link with the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Robertsfield International Airport, which was captured by rebels several 
weeks ago, Spriggs-Payne can take only small planes but was in use until 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats reported heavy fighting in the eastern part of the city, where troops 
loyal to rebel leader Charles Taylor have resumed their offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Insurgents commanded by another rebel leader, Prince Johnson, have taken all of 
the city's northern Bushrod Island, where they control the port and oil depots. 
</P>
<P>
With attacks from the east and north, the city appeared to be caught in a vise 
that could clamp shut today, Liberia's independence day. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Information Minister Paul Allen Wie, at an impromptu news conference 
held as gunfire echoed all around, said Doe was as defiant as ever and has no 
intention of resigning. 
</P>
<P>
"The president thinks it is worth dying for his country," Wie said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to a call to resign from black U.S. members of Congress, Doe said: "I 
cannot heed the advice . . . to quit the leadership of Liberia because it would 
introduce a dangerous precedent of outrageous rebellion and instability into 
the West African region." 
</P>
<P>
Doe met U.S. Ambassador Peter de Vos on Tuesday and assured him that Liberian 
government threats against Washington in the past few days would not lead to an 
outright break in relations. 
</P>
<P>
But the government repeated its accusation that the United States is aiding the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Doe still has 
not requested U.S. aid in leaving Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II, meanwhile, appealed for an end to the civil war, and a Roman 
Catholic newspaper reported that the pontiff's scheduled trip to West Africa in 
January might be postponed because of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic daily newspaper Avvenire reported that the trip might be put off 
at least until September, 1991. A Vatican spokesman said he could not comment 
on the report because the situation in Liberia was still changing.

HOUSE PANEL OKS ANTI-BIAS BILL OPPOSED BY BUSH

<P>
The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday approved a major civil rights bill 
to curb job discrimination and brushed aside Bush Administration warnings that 
the legislation will lead to hiring quotas. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not bring forth a bill that will lead to quotas or any danger of 
quotas," Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), the bill's sponsor, said before the 
panel approved the measure, 24 to 12. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights forces are pushing for floor action on the bill as early as next 
week. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said last week that a floor vote 
would not be held until after lawmakers return from their August recess. 
</P>
<P>
By wide margins, committee Democrats beat back Republican-sponsored amendments 
designed to limit damages that courts may award to victims of discrimination 
and to tighten the rules governing fair-hiring lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which tops the civil rights movement's legislative agenda, would 
effectively reverse five Supreme Court decisions from last year. Provisions 
range from a ban on racial harassment in the workplace to punitive damages for 
discrimination victims in extreme cases. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial provision was designed to reverse a Supreme Court ruling 
that favors companies in certain discrimination lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, companies could win such suits if they proved that the 
employment practices leading to the disparity were required by "business 
necessity." The new ruling makes it easier for employers, placing on those 
filing suit the burden of proving that the practices in question are not 
business necessities. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration and a number of businesses object that the bill's 
definition of business necessity combined with provisions for damages will lead 
to a jump in discrimination lawsuits by lawyers eager to share in court 
judgments. 
</P>
<P>
The critics say that companies will adopt the practice of hiring by racial and 
ethnic quotas as a means of insulating themselves from such lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"This should really be called the plaintiffs' lawyers' full employment act of 
1990," Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), a supporter of the bill, conceded that "there are 
horror stories about over-enforcement" of similar laws but added that such 
instances were rare and those intent on discriminating found ways to get away 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
"The advantage is overwhelmingly with the sophisticated bigot," he said.

Jurors on Wednesday heard one of three defendants confess on videotape his role 
in the gang rape and assault of a Central Park jogger. 
</P>
<P>
The woman "was just hollering, like help, help. 
</P>
<P>
They kept smacking her," Raymond Santana, 15, said in the confession. 
</P>
<P>
The videotape played in state Supreme Court capped the prosecution's case in 
the trial of three youths charged with taking part in a "wilding" rampage in 
Central Park that left a 30-year-old female investment banker near death and 
partially disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Some jurors seemed to doze off during parts of the tape, but their attention 
was riveted when Santana described how some of his companions hit the jogger in 
the head with a brick and another dropped his pants to have sex with her. 
</P>
<P>
Santana named three other youths -- Kevin Richardson, Steven Lopez and Kharey 
Wise -- who have been indicted and will be tried later. 
</P>
<P>
When the woman kept yelling for help, Santana recalled that Lopez said, "Shut 
up, bitch," and "He picked up the brick and he hit (her) with the brick, 
twice." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Elizabeth Lederer then asked: "After he hit her in the head with the 
brick did she stop screaming?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, 'cause she was like, shocked," Santana replied. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, two detectives testified about damaging statements made by 
Santana and another defendant, Yusef Salaam, 16, while at a police precinct. 
</P>
<P>
"How much time am I looking at for what happened?" Detective Joseph Neenan said 
Salaam asked him. 
</P>
<P>
The videotape was the second shown during the trial. Jurors last week viewed 
the confession of the third defendant, Antron McCray, 16. Salaam was never 
videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
Santana, Salaam and McCray are being tried on 13 criminal counts, including 
attempted murder, rape and sodomy.

STUBBORN LEAK GROUNDS SHUTTLE ATLANTIS UNTIL FALL

NASA's last-ditch effort to fix an Atlantis hydrogen leak on the launch pad 
failed Wednesday and the agency had to postpone the shuttle flight until later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
NASA engineers, who had hoped to avoid a long delay by quickly repairing the 
leak while the ship was on the pad, said the shuttle must be returned to the 
hangar for more work. It had been scheduled for use in a secret military 
mission next month. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle Columbia, also being repaired since a different kind of hydrogen 
leak caused a planned May launch to be scrubbed, will be the next shuttle to 
fly. It is scheduled for an astronomy mission in September, and NASA officials 
said they expect it to be ready in time. 
</P>
<P>
The developments came as a space agency team began probing NASA's most 
publicized problem: the flawed mirror on the $1.5-billion Hubble Space 
Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
The team of seven, led by Lew Allen, director of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, heard testimony in secret at 
Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc., which made the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
The flaw has halved the effectiveness of the telescope, which was put into 
orbit in April. 
</P>
<P>
Experts had hoped that the problem with Atlantis could be solved with simple 
launch pad repairs, but the leak reappeared during a test Wednesday and 
engineers concluded they still did not fully understand the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not able to fix it. We have learned more, so we will roll back 
smarter," William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program, said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA will try to launch Atlantis for the classified Pentagon flight in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
The latest leak, detected when liquid hydrogen was pumped into Atlantis' 
external fuel tank, was about the size of the leak detected in two previous 
tests and was in the same area, a flange in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen 
from the tank to the main engines. 
</P>
<P>
Workers tightened bolts around the flange and checked the welds, though 
engineers said they doubted that would be enough to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Had the spot held Wednesday, NASA would have tried to launch Atlantis in 
mid-August and Columbia in September. Now, officials intend to get Columbia 
ready to be moved to the launch pad in early August, shuttle director Robert L. 
Crippen said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA officials want to get at least one shuttle up before Discovery's mission 
in October with Ulysses, a satellite that will explore the sun's poles. 
Discovery has a 19-day "window" in which it must lift off or the mission will 
have to be delayed 13 months.

A newly repaired unmanned rocket blasted into space Wednesday with a satellite 
that will use chemicals to transform Earth's invisible magnetic field lines 
into brilliant bursts of color. 
</P>
<P>
The 143-foot Atlas rocket roared into a clear sky, and the satellite separated 
from the booster 28 minutes after launch, drawing applause at the control 
center. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth attempt by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
and rocket builder General Dynamics to launch the Atlas, the first commercial 
version of the rocket ever flown. 
</P>
<P>
"We have about the best flight we could possibly hope for," launch commentator 
George Diller said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's scheduled launch was called off after the Atlas failed to transfer 
power just before liftoff. A corroded power transfer switch in the rocket was 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Four liquid helium vent ducts were replaced a few days earlier. One of them 
slipped off an engine outlet in the rocket's upper-stage thrust section, 
forcing postponement of Friday's launch attempt. Threatening thunderstorms 
caused Sunday's delay. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was perfect Wednesday as the Atlas boosted the $189-million 
Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite to an elliptical orbit 217 
miles by 22,236 miles high to study radiation in space. 
</P>
<P>
The two-ton satellite holds 24 chemical-filled canisters that will be released 
starting this fall. A 25-minute timer in each canister will release barium, 
lithium and other chemicals in vapor form once the spacecraft is at a safe 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
Ultraviolet rays from the sun will ionize the chemicals, creating glowing 
clouds that will spread along Earth's magnetic field lines. 
</P>
<P>
The barium-laden clouds will resemble the aurora borealis, or the northern 
lights. All of the displays will be visible to the naked eye. Scientists will 
be able to measure electric fields and see how they interact with normally 
invisible charged particles.

ART SEIDENBAUM; TIMES COLUMNIST, WRITER AND EDITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Art Seidenbaum, columnist, editor, writer and wry observer of the Los Angeles 
cultural, literary and political scenes for nearly 30 years, died Tuesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The editor of The Times' Opinion section and local Emmy award winner -- whose 
flair for the art of conversation and penchant for puns made him one of the 
most delightful personalities at this newspaper -- was 60. He had been 
diagnosed as having cancer earlier this year and died at his home in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Shelby Coffey III, editor and executive vice president of The Times, reflected 
that "Art Seidenbaum had a range of interests -- from the highly intellectual 
to the intricately whimsical -- rare in journalism. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a writer of uncommon zest and an editor with a sure and steady hand. He 
brought an enthusiastic discipline to his work at The Times and his many 
contributions over three decades made it a better paper." 
</P>
<P>
Seidenbaum, first as a reporter and correspondent for the Saturday Evening Post 
and Life magazine and later as columnist, book editor and Opinion editor for 
The Times, dealt with what he once described as "the whole living experience in 
Los Angeles . . . the problems, the joys and the sociological style that set 
this city apart. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But that was a lofty, formal description he had provided for an official 
company biography, one that was much more solemn than its author. 
</P>
<P>
In person he was more prankster than pundit -- a lover of language who 
delighted in twisting the King's English into ribald ripostes more suited to 
the streets of his native New York City than to the hallowed halls of Harvard 
where he became a graduate student majoring in English after graduating from 
Northwestern University in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Later he became a Naval air officer who then wrote about aviation for Life 
before becoming a cultural columnist for The Times in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew as little about culture as I did about aviation," he allowed. 
</P>
<P>
But he did know enough to stay at home with his musings in those early years. 
"I'm a gregarious animal and I'd spend too much time around the coffee 
machine," had he written from the office. 
</P>
<P>
He kept his phone number listed and his thrice-weekly columns reflected an odd 
blend of cultural events, domestic travails and the reflections of strangers 
who took advantage of his availability. 
</P>
<P>
"I choose subjects by personal adrenaline -- what happens to be bothering me," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966 he became even more visible as the moderator of "City Watchers," a 
weekly one-hour program broadcast until 1976 over KCET-TV. The show was an 
examination of Los Angeles from films to flimflam and generally included guest 
experts in diverse fields. He and his co-host, Times arts editor Charles 
Champlin, were awarded Emmys in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978 Seidenbaum (pronounced Sigh-den-bohm, he would explain patiently) 
became editor of The Times' book review section, a job that brought him into 
closer touch with his literary pals across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Book editors, or "book beggars" as he liked to call them, devote their lives to 
hiring great minds for relatively little pay who then spend hours critiquing 
current literary offerings. 
</P>
<P>
He performed a similar function with Opinion, seeking the thoughts of 
politicians, sociologists and international affairs experts on topics of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
It was that job he held until he was victimized by cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The Seidenbaum legend at The Times, however, extended far beyond his 
professional capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Secretaries learned not to remove shoes from weary feet and walk away from 
their desks, for he was a master at hiding one -- it was always one -- in an 
obscure file cabinet. Those who liked to bring their lunch learned not to leave 
it lying about -- sandwiches and apples could vanish for days at a time. Phones 
at various editors' desks would ring and it would be several minutes before 
they recognized the heavily accented voice on the other end offering absurd 
advice or complaining about the paper's policies as that of their devious 
colleague. Writers in his vicinity learned to shut off their word processors 
before leaving their desks to prevent him from sending nonsensical messages 
across the building under their names. 
</P>
<P>
And visitors to the Times building -- be they presidents or publicists -- often 
found themselves choking on their official lunches after a Seidenbaum pun had 
cackled across the table. 
</P>
<P>
He would readdress press releases to colleagues who would understand them 
least. Women whose children had long since grown up would get information on 
child-bearing classes. Science writers would get invitations to art showings 
and art critics to science lectures. 
</P>
<P>
One of his favored ploys was to take a manuscript of several hundred pages and 
deposit it on an aide's desk as the noon hour neared. He would then quickly 
walk away saying he "needed a one-paragraph abstract by early this afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
His own published manuscripts ran a gamut from the coffee-table epic "Los 
Angeles 200: A Bicentennial Celebration" with pictures by Times photographer 
John Malmin to "Confrontation on Campus," a collection of articles about 
California colleges. 
</P>
<P>
More in keeping with the airy Seidenbaum style, however, was "This Is 
California -- Please Keep Out," a defense of his adopted state in which he 
allowed that California needn't be taken so seriously and that Easterners 
shouldn't be so judgmental as they pondered why their children preferred to 
live Out West. 
</P>
<P>
"The great lesson we've learned in California," he wrote, "is the danger of 
being locked in and the promise of staying in motion. In California, the going 
itself is good." 
</P>
<P>
Before he fell ill, he had been planning yet another book on his beloved West. 
</P>
<P>
Seidenbaum's longtime secretary, Priscilla Hansen, said he answered every phone 
call, letter and message that came to his desk. Friends he hadn't seen since 
elementary school kept in touch as did the literary lights of the nation for 
whom he became both editor and congenial companion. 
</P>
<P>
And he was in constant demand as a speaker, not just for what he had to say but 
for his pixilated prose. 
</P>
<P>
Seidenbaum received awards from groups ranging from Loyola Marymount University 
to the American Psychological Assn. to the American Society of Landscape 
Architects to his Emmy, and was embarrassed by each. He also taught, sharing 
his askant view of life in classrooms at UCLA, Immaculate Heart College, USC 
and Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Patricia; three sons, Kyle Seidenbaum and Paul and 
Thomas White, and two daughters, Kerry Ken-Cairn and Janet White. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no services, at his request. A celebration of his life is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
The family asks contributions in Seidenbaum's name to The Tree People, Las 
Familias del Pueblo or Maryvale, the orphanage. 
</P>
<P>

old friend. F1.

AS PADRES FADE RAPIDLY INTO THE WEST, SO DO THE PROFITS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: TEAM'S LOSING STRETCH TRANSLATES INTO SLOWER TICKET SALES AND LESS 
MONEY FOR THE STADIUM AND THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Padres, once favored to win the National League pennant, have 
been falling faster than a teen-ager with a crush. And the baseball team's 
collapse affects more than just players and standings. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Wilson, manager of San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, points out that lower 
Padre ticket sales mean less money for the stadium and for the city that owns 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothers me," Wilson said of the Padres' slide. "It's difficult to be here 
all day long and sit through another crushing defeat and go home depressed. The 
city and the stadium are dependent on the tenants. When they do well, we do 
well. When they don't. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for the first time since it opened in 1967, the stadium made money, 
Wilson said. Its $200,000-plus profit went into the city's general fund and 
provided a boost at a time when San Diego's projected deficit for the current 
fiscal year was in excess of $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson credits the surplus to the Padres' furious finish in the second half of 
last season. He worries that this season's second-half tumble may cast a pall 
over 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"When teams lose, and attendance falls, we lose -- no question about it," he 
said. "We get 10% of ticket sales and all of the parking (revenue). If the 
stadium loses money, that means, for certain, no stadium improvements, and we 
always need those. 
</P>
<P>
"It also means we have to pull money from the city's Sports Arena land lease, 
which represents our fallback. We made more than $200,000 last year and would 
have done better had the Padres made the playoffs. A lot better." 
</P>
<P>
So far in 1990, the Padres have not performed poorly at the gate. Average 
attendance through Tuesday's 10-0 victory over Cincinnati was 26,095, only 
slightly below the best-ever mark notched during the 1985 season (27,288 per 
game), which was fueled by the pennant-winning season of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Strasberg, the Padres' director of marketing, said this season's special 
pro motional nights have been among the best ever. Most occurred, however, 
before July's fall from grace. Cap Night on April 21 drew the largest crowd of 
the year -- 56,147. Sports Bag Night on June 2 drew 55,564. Towel Night on July 
7 drew 52,922. 
</P>
<P>
Strasberg hopes that upcoming promotions -- Saturday's Old-Timers' Game and the 
KGB Sky Show on Sept. 21 -- will help salvage the second half. He said he hoped 
that Wednesday night's appearance by comedienne Roseanne Barr, who sang the 
national anthem before the second game of the double-header, has the same 
effect at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
There were 25,744 people at the doubleheader, which the Padres won -- leaving 
them 18 games out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
Strasberg said he tries to offer "a complete entertainment package," one that 
isn't dependent on the success of a team. However, in his words, "Winning 
presents opportunities like nothing else can." 
</P>
<P>
Two local banks saw opportunities in the team's predicted first-place finish 
and decided to launch special Padres promotions, neither of which has been a 
rousing success. 
</P>
<P>
Milt Kistler, first vice president of San Diego Trust &amp; Savings Bank, said 
a new Padres' credit card -- bearing the team insignia and offering gifts and 
tickets to Padre games -- has clearly been affected by the plummet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's running below target, and sure, if they were on top, the card would be 
doing much better," Kistler said. "Even so, we're not overly concerned. We 
think that ultimately the product will meet its goals. After all, it is a 
credit card, and people like to have credit cards, no matter what they have on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
On July 2, just before losing tightened its grip on the Padres, HomeFed Bank 
began a Padres checking account. Each check bears the team logo and, like the 
San Diego Trust credit card, offers special Padre "incentives," such as tickets 
and souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something we're trying to drive in a lot of business, but no, it 
hasn't done as well as we'd hoped," said Maura Grimes of HomeFed Bank. "Still, 
we like our relationship with the Padres and want to continue it. Winning makes 
it better, though, no question about it." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Allen, assistant manager of the San Diego Padres Clubhouse Shop, said he 
had noticed a pronounced drop-off in sales at his store at North County Fair in 
Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
"We also have a TeleSeat outlet here in the store," Allen said. "I've noticed a 
definite decrease in ticket sales. I've noticed a particular drop-off in 
last-second impulse buying. You know, little things like Padre key chains by 
the cash register. People don't pick those up as readily as they used to. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a flood of interest in Padre stuff at the start of the season, and no 
doubt about it, it's dropped off, while interest in other teams has picked up. 
That's the way fans are. But it's hardly enough to cripple the store. We do 
real, real well." 
</P>
<P>
Stadium Authority Board member Mike Gotch said a prolonged slump often has a 
"domino effect" on ticket sales from one season to the next. 
</P>
<P>
Stadium manager Wilson said slumps make it more incumbent on him to try to 
compensate for lost revenue by booking other events, such as rock concerts. 
</P>
<P>
The Rolling Stones' 1981 show was the stadium's biggest one-day moneymaker, 
netting more than $250,000, Wilson said. Last year's appearance by the Who 
netted about $190,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson notices another consequence when a team that's expected to play well 
just doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I get complaints," he said. "Do I ever get complaints. That's when people 
complain about parking, restrooms, or like we've heard recently, our need to 
conserve water. It must be because people are irritated. When our teams are 
winning, I don't hear a word."

COURT OPENS WAITING ROOM FOR CHILDREN 
</P>

<P>
Children who have to testify in court will no longer have to spend the day 
waiting in a dull room with nothing to do. 
</P>
<P>
After two months of collecting toys and furniture from area donors, the 
district attorney's office has given a new look the children's waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
A mural depicting a grassy hillside by the beach, painted by a local artist, 
brightens one side of the room, while shelves are brimming with new toys. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted this to be a place where children wouldn't be afraid to come," said 
Kate McGoldrick, director of the district attorney's Victim Services Division. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 1,000 children visited the division in the Government 
Center's Hall of Justice in Ventura, McGoldrick said. Many of those children 
sought out the Wee Witness Waiting Room on the fourth floor while waiting to 
testify in court or before an interview with attorneys, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really important to a child to have a place free from anxiety, especially 
when many of those who are here have experienced some sort of violence or 
sexual abuse in their home," McGoldrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Victim Services Division announced earlier this year the need to 
renovate the scuffed-up waiting room, more than 40 residents, businesses and 
community organizations responded with board games, fire trucks, dolls, stuffed 
animals and books, she said. 
</P>
<P>
One woman who requested anonymity donated $200 worth of toys after winning the 
California Lottery, McGoldrick said. Others provided money for new furniture 
and shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"The response from the community has been absolutely tremendous," she said.

FARM GETS FIRST SLUDGE DELIVERY; 
</P>
<P>
WASTE: THE LOAD TRUCKED TO ANTELOPE VALLEY FOR A DEMONSTRATION MAY BE ONLY A 
WHIFF OF THINGS TO COME.

The first load of sewage sludge to be trucked into the Antelope Valley from Los 
Angeles was used as fertilizer on a remote farm Wednesday, giving the area a 
preview of a larger program that may soon get under way. 
</P>
<P>
In a special demonstration for a visiting Environmental Protection Agency 
official, the city spread about 20 tons of the concentrated waste material. 
Within two months, Los Angeles could begin exporting up to 100 tons a day to 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration had two glitches. There was a dispute over who asked for the 
demonstration, and state water board officials said they were surprised by the 
offensive smell. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, which produces about 1,350 tons a day of the black sewage solids, 
has been looking for cheaper and closer disposal alternatives than the farm 
fields it has been using in distant Riverside County and in Yuma, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials insist that using the sludge as a farm fertilizer will 
not cause odor problems or contaminate ground water. The agricultural reuse of 
sludge is more common in the East, but it has been done sporadically in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's demonstration occurred at a 640-acre ranch 14 miles west of 
Lancaster in a remote agricultural area. Bio Gro Systems Inc., the private firm 
hired by the city to manage the sludge reuse program, plans to use the same 
site once the larger sludge program commences. 
</P>
<P>
A truck brought the sludge from the city's Hyperion sewage treatment plant near 
El Segundo earlier in the day, traveling up the San Diego and Antelope Valley 
freeways. As about 25 people watched, a spreader sent the sludge flying over a 
15- to 20-foot arc. 
</P>
<P>
Lauren Fondahl, the EPA's regional sludge coordinator, said she had no comment 
on the demonstration. The state Regional Water Quality Control Board in May 
granted permission for the full program, but it has yet to start because the 
city and Bio Gro have not met all the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
State water board officials said they granted special permission for 
Wednesday's test after being told the EPA had asked to see it. But EPA 
officials said they had not done so, insisting the demonstration was done 
entirely at the city of Los Angeles' behest. 
</P>
<P>
As it lay on the ground in a heap, the sludge had only a mild fertilizer smell. 
But once the spreader flung it into the air, a foul smell spread over the farm. 
Said one water board official, "It smells bad."

RYAN YANKED IN FIRST TRY; 
</P>
<P>
MILESTONE: RANGERS' RALLY COMES TOO LATE TO HELP PITCHER GAIN HIS 300TH 
VICTORY. NEXT START WILL BE MONDAY OR TUESDAY IN MILWAUKEE.

<P>
At the time of his departure Wednesday night, Nolan Ryan was closer to his 
268th career loss than his 300th victory. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that he didn't get either represented a strange turn of events in his 
first bid for the milestone figure attained by only 19 other pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old Ryan, 10-4 on the season and seeking his sixth consecutive 
victory, gave up 10 hits and seven runs to the New York Yankees and was losing, 
7-3, when he left after eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
His Texas Rangers then staged an improbable rally that resulted in a 9-7, 
11-inning victory that went to relief pitcher Ken Rogers, who allowed only one 
hit over the final three innings and is now 4-5 on the season and 7-9 for his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Those weren't the numbers the partisans in a sellout crowd of 41,954 at 
Arlington Stadium had in mind when Ryan went to work, but those that hadn't 
left when Rogers appeared to pitch the ninth cheered wildly as the Rangers 
roared back, taking Ryan off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrated right-hander is now scheduled to make his second try for 300 
either Monday or Tuesday night in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers return to Arlington for a four-game series with the Toronto Blue 
Jays starting Thursday night, but Ryan said he didn't know if the rotation 
would be juggled to allow him to make his second bid at home. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to win as many games as possible, so I presume we won't change 
everyone's schedule," he said. "I don't want this thing to drag out or a cloud 
to develop by having to make three or four starts before I get it, so having 
failed tonight my next goal is to try and get it done in Milwaukee." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said he had good stuff but poor location against the Yankees. He felt that 
the stress fracture in his lower back wasn't a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I made too many bad pitches with my fastball," he said. "I was ahead in the 
count but had poor command. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every one of their big hits came on fastballs that were either up in 
the strike zone or had too much of the plate.' 
</P>
<P>
With the eyes of Texas -- as well as a national television audience -- on him, 
Ryan said he wanted this game as much as any game this year. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have so many people behind you and personally involved in what you're 
doing, the last thing you want to do is pitch poorly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed that I wasn't the winning pitcher considering the amount 
of support I received. Any time I get three or four runs, I feel I should win. 
</P>
<P>
"But, in fact, I almost took us out of the game and it took a special effort to 
come back. It would have been easy for the guys to have an emotional letdown 
after I came out because they had been as pumped up as I've ever seen them." 
</P>
<P>
Restricted by Yankee starter Dave LaPoint, whose offspeed repertoire is ice 
compared to Ryan's fire, to a two-run single by Pete Incaviglia in the first 
and a solo run stemming from Steve Buechele's double in the seventh, the 
Rangers tied it dramatically with two out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Righetti, who had blown only two of 22 previous save opportunities, was 
within one out of saving another when Ruben Sierra singled in a run to make it 
7-5 and Incaviglia belted a two-run homer to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Mark Leiter, who made his major league debut Tuesday night, was pitching 
in the 11th when Rafael Palmeiro slammed a two-run homer for the unlikely 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan delivered 141 pitches as Manager Bobby Valentine kept sending him out in a 
vain hope the Rangers could come from behind before he would have to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan struck out nine, walked three and averaged 94 miles per hour on the speed 
gun, but he lost a 2-1 lead in the fourth on solo homers by Kevin Maas and 
Roberto Kelly and never got even. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Bob Geren, who came in with six homers and 19 runs batted in, made it 
5-2 with a two-run single in the sixth and 7-3 with a two-out, two-run homer in 
the eighth, Ryan's last inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees entered the game last in the American League in hits and runs and 
burdened with the worst record in the major leagues, but Ryan had been 
concerned with the anonymous nature of a lineup that included four rookies and 
was devoid of Don Mattingly, who is scheduled to have a chronic back problem 
re-examined in New York today and may be lost for the season, Manager Stump 
Merrill said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a lot of new names, and that's good and bad," Ryan said of the 
Yankees before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer to know who they are, know what they hit and what I have to 
throw to get them out." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan would soon acquire a degree of familiarity, but it may have bred only 
contempt. 
</P>
<P>
The rookies treated the venerable Ryan with disdain, the 10 Yankee hits 
matching the most Ryan had allowed in 17 previous starts this year and the 
seven runs matching the most he had allowed in two years with Texas. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ryan had allowed only nine home runs in 104 1/3 innings this year 
before yielding three to a team now known as the Bronx Bummers. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan probably wanted to re-read the scouting report as early as the first 
inning when rookie Deion Sanders opened the game by lining a two-strike triple 
into the right-field corner and scored on Steve Sax's infield grounder. 
</P>
<P>
His problems with the other Yankee rookies included the homer by Maas, his 
seventh in 54 at-bats, a double and single by Oscar Azocar, and a key single by 
Jim Leyritz in the sixth, when Geren later delivered his bases-loaded single. 
</P>
<P>
Two walks played a part in that inning, and Ryan had two outs in the eighth 
when he walked Kelly before yielding the homer to Geren that put 300 out of 
reach for this night.

PADRES LIKE THE SOUND OF BEATING REDS TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Disharmony filled San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium Wednesday evening, but for a 
change, it wasn't the Padres' problem. 
</P>
<P>
No, the rampaging Padres swept a doubleheader from the Cincinnati Reds, 2-1 and 
10-4, giving them three victories in a row over the NL West's first-place team 
and allowing them to feel pretty good about themselves, at least for a night. 
</P>
<P>
If you steered clear of the Padre clubhouse, though, positive vibrations 
weren't the order of the evening. The Padres were about the only ones in a good 
mood. Between games, the crowd of 25,744 booed lustily when comedienne Roseanne 
Barr made a mockery of the national anthem, and Cincinnati Manager Lou 
Piniella, angry after the 2-1 loss to the fourth-place Padres, refused to open 
the Cincinnati clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella hasn't liked what he has seen this week, and it's easy to understand 
why. After a Cincinnati victory Monday, the Padres have suddenly begun to look 
like the team many expected them to be, and they pretty much dismantled a 
Cincinnati team that arrived with the highest winning percentage in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella had cooled off by the end of the evening. What else could he do? 
</P>
<P>
"They hit everything we threw up there today," Piniella said. "We've got to 
regroup tomorrow. That's all we can do." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres scored 10 runs against the Reds Tuesday and again on Wednesday, the 
second and third times they have done so this season. That matches a Cincinnati 
season high for runs allowed in a game. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys have no idea how good this feels," said Padre Manager Greg Riddoch, 
whose victory output Wednesday matched his previous total for the season. He is 
now 4-11. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, the Padres got a vintage performance from Ed Whitson and a 
rare one from reliever Craig Lefferts. Then, in Game 2, they unleashed an 
offense that had been curiously quiet for most of the past month, pounding out 
a season-high 20 hits. 
</P>
<P>
First, the glitter. In the second game, the Padres scored in each of the first 
six innings. Mike Pagliarulo was three for five with five runs-batted in, Tony 
Gwynn went four for five with two RBIs, and Tom Lampkin and Roberto Alomar each 
had three hits. Pitcher Calvin Schiraldi even homered in the fifth. The Padres 
chased Cincinnati starter Rick Mahler (4-4) after four innings. He allowed 12 
hits and eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
Schiraldi made his first start of the season in the second game. He went six 
innings, allowing two runs and five hits as he ran his record to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
The drama came in the first game. The Padres scored two runs in the first 
inning and got an impressive defensive play from shortstop Garry Templeton in 
the sixth. Combine that with Whitson and Lefferts . . . 
</P>
<P>
Whitson (8-7) went 7 1/3 innings, allowing a run on six hits. He struck out 
four and walked none while lowering his earned-run average to 2.84. He threw 89 
pitches -- 60 for strikes. 
</P>
<P>
He has now gone seven consecutive starts -- 48 1/3 innings -- without allowing 
a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was just his second victory since June 23 and third since June 2. In 
his seven losses, the Padres have scored more than one run just twice. They 
were shut out once. 
</P>
<P>
You can understand, then, why Whitson's postgame cigarette seemed to taste 
better than usual. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, Lordy," he said. "It's about time I get one of these 2-1 wins. We've had 
some serious bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason he was able to get the victory was because of Templeton's 
game-saving leap to his right in the sixth. The score was 2-1, Barry Larkin was 
on second, and Eric Davis was at the plate with two out. Davis hit a hard 
grounder into the hole between short and third that might have scored Larkin, 
but Templeton dove, stood up and fired to first. He caught Davis by a step. 
Whitson waited to greet Templeton before leaving the field. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the turning point of the game, I thought," Whitson said. "That was 
one of Tempy's old plays he made years and years ago. He's still making them." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson left in the eighth with one out and Larkin on second, again the 
potential tying run. Lefferts came on for his first appearance in 10 days and 
was sharp. He held the Reds hitless and struck out two while earning his 13th 
save. He has allowed just four of his past 29 inherited runners to score. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a new guy you've heard about on the mound," Padre Manager Greg 
Riddoch said, smiling. "His name is Craig Lefferts. We just brought him up from 
the bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch said he wanted to use Lefferts in Tuesday's game, but Bruce Hurst was 
throwing a shutout, and how can you take a guy out of the game when he's doing 
that? So he talked with Lefferts in the outfield before Wednesday's 
doubleheader, and Lefferts assured Riddoch that he would be ready anytime 
Riddoch needed him. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me (rest) doesn't affect him like some pitchers when they don't get 
used a lot," Riddoch said. "He was right." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres scored two in the first, and it turned out that that was enough. Bip 
Roberts led off with an infield single, and Alomar followed with a single up 
the middle, moving Roberts to second. Trouble was, Gwynn grounded into a double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts moved to third on Gwynn's grounder, and the Padres were in a situation 
they're pretty good at blowing: Two outs, runner in scoring position. Not 
tonight. Roberts scored on a passed ball with Jack Clark at the plate, and then 
Clark walked. Joe Carter followed by drilling a ball just inside of third base 
and into the Padre bullpen in left. Clark scored, and Carter had a stand-up 
double. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres led, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Things got easier later, and who would have figured that the Padres would take 
three of four from the Reds and sweep their first doubleheader since June 17, 
1988, against the Dodgers? It was their first home doubleheader sweep since 
Aug. 9, 1985, against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres still trail the Reds by 18 games, though. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal isn't to catch the Reds, it's getting whoever is on top of us (in the 
standings)," Whitson said. 
</P>
<P>
They say it's not over until the fat lady sings, and Roseanne sure sang 
Wednesday -- or tried to, anyway. So what happens? The Padres go out and win 
again, against Cincinnati, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
So maybe Roseanne should come back and sing again? 
</P>
<P>
Nah. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Benito Santiago had the cast removed from his left arm Tuesday night 
and went through his first rehabilitation workout Wednesday afternoon. Santiago 
said he will wait a week before discussing a target date for his comeback. It 
likely will not be before mid-August, though, and possibly as late as Sept. 1. 
His arm was weak, and he worked with light weights, but Santiago said he felt 
great mentally having just gotten rid of the cast. "The thing drove me crazy," 
he said. "It was on a month and a week, but it felt like a year and a half 
already." Padre Manager Greg Riddoch said he doesn't want to rush Santiago's 
return. "It's encouraging to see the kid back out here," Riddoch said. "It's 
important that we make sure he's 100%. We don't want a situation where he's set 
back." Riddoch said the Padres haven't yet decided whether Santiago will spend 
time on a rehabilitation assignment in Las Vegas (triple-A), but if he did, he 
would have to make a pretty quick recovery; the triple-A season is done by the 
end of August. Santiago's arm was broken on June 14 when San Francisco pitcher 
Jeff Brantley hit him with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The new Padres owners would like to change the team's uniform colors to navy 
blue and orange. Any change would have to be approved by major league baseball. 
. . . Bruce Hurst has thrown the past two complete games by a Padre pitcher. He 
defeated Cincinnati, 10-0, Tuesday and St. Louis, 3-1, on July 7. . . . Padre 
Library: Bip Roberts is reading Dave Dravecky's book "Comeback." "It's pretty 
good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's and Saturday's games against Houston will both begin at 7:35 p.m. Joan 
Kroc Night is Friday, and the Equitable Old-Timers game is Saturday. This is 
the last Equitable Old-Timers event, as the company has decided to not sponsor 
the series anymore. It will not be a regular game but take the form of a 
home-run hitting contest. . . . Cincinnati second baseman Mariano Duncan left 
the first game Wednesday for a pinch-hitter in the third inning after 
re-aggravating an injury to his left wrist.

MEHMETORI GETS THERE ON TIME; 
</P>
<P>
DEL MAR: BIG CROWD, PRINTERS SLOW THINGS DOWN ON OPENING DAY. FOREST GLOW WINS 
SECOND HALF OF FEATURE.

DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a day when the daily programs and many favorites were not known for their 
timeliness, Mehmetori was a punctual arrival at the wire in the first half of 
the Oceanside Stakes as Del Mar launched its 43-day racing season. Wednesday's 
crowd was 25,684, and despite temperatures in the 80s, there was still a 
blizzard -- of discarded parimutuel tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Mehmetori's late-running victory by a head over In Excess was a breeze compared 
to the second half of the Oceanside. Forest Glow, in front almost all the way, 
held on to nose out Pro for Sure, who rallied from far back. 
</P>
<P>
The finish was so close that the jockeys, Gary Stevens aboard Forest Glow and 
Laffit Pincay astride Pro for Sure, lingered in front of the tote board until 
the placing judges eyeballed the picture from the photo-finish camera. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, the winner's circle was going to get a MacDonald. Forest Glow is 
trained by Brad MacDonald, and Mark, his older brother -- by a year -- saddles 
Pro for Sure. 
</P>
<P>
Brad MacDonald, 32, got his first stakes winner at Del Mar, as did Richard 
Mulhall, who trains Mehmetori. A $33,000 yearling purchase, Mehmetori could not 
have won, in Mulhall's opinion, but for a canny, gritty ride by Julio Garcia, 
who also was scoring his first Del Mar victory. 
</P>
<P>
"He came between horses (in the stretch) and that was the difference," Mulhall 
said. "If he goes around, I don't think my horse gets there." 
</P>
<P>
Predecessor finished third, almost two lengths behind Mehmetori, with the 3-1 
favorite, Robyn Dancer, running fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia failed to sweep the Oceanside when Kept His Cool, the 3-1 favorite in 
the second division, finished off the board. After Forest Glow and Pro for 
Sure, it was three lengths back to Bel Air Paster in third place. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was about 1,600 more than the attendance at last year's Del Mar 
opener. The early-bird patrons, who can start betting at 8:30 a.m., were 
frustrated when the track programs didn't arrive until almost an hour after the 
windows opened. Just before the day's first post, there were long lines at the 
stands selling programs. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how you prepare, something always seems to happen," said Joe Harper, 
the longtime Del Mar general manager starting his first season as track 
president. "The delay in the programs is one of the disadvantages of having 
them printed in San Diego (about 25 miles away)." 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 miles north of Del Mar, at Hollywood Park, where there was 
satellite betting on the races here, the programs didn't arrive until 30 
minutes before the first post. 
</P>
<P>
Mehmetori was not tardy, although placed last after a half-mile in his 10-horse 
field. He earned $40,575 for his owners, Jack Arnold and Bill Miller, running 
the mile on grass in 1:35 2/5, and paying $9.40 for a $2 win ticket. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was only the second in nine starts for Mehmetori, and his first in 
four races on grass, and the win could trigger a good season for the Mulhall 
barn, which hasn't had much success here in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Mulhall, 51, also trains Mohamed Abdu, who will be one of the contenders in the 
Eddie Read Handicap later in the season, and he got good news even before 
Mehmetori ran when Sawsan, a 2-year-old filly, worked five furlongs Wednesday 
morning in a promising :59 1/5. Sawsan will be running in the Junior Miss 
Stakes next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Glow, bred and owned by John A. Bell III, ran in Kentucky as a 
2-year-old and needed two races at the recently completed Hollywood Park 
meeting before hitting his stride, winning an allowance race on July 4. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first stakes win anywhere, and I'm in a state of mild shock," Brad 
MacDonald said. "I beat my brother by an inch. While we were waiting for the 
photo, I asked him if he wanted to split (the purse) and he told me no." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, leading Del Mar rider in 1987-88, wound up with three winners 
Wednesday. Forest Glow was timed in 1:36 and paid $25.40. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know who won," Stevens said. "When I stood up two jumps after the 
wire, the other horse was ahead of me. This course doesn't favor speed at this 
time of the meet, but Brad said to just let him roll. That's his style, and I 
wasn't supposed to fight him. I tried to steal away with a half-mile to go and 
it worked, but it was a little closer than I liked." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay thought that Pro for Sure had gotten up in the last jump. The five-time 
Del Mar riding champion quietly walked off the track while Stevens and Brad 
MacDonald gave each other high-fives in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>

Escondido Handicap at Del Mar on Aug. 11, according to trainer Thad Ackel. 
"That race the other day was 1 1/16 miles," Ackel said. "That's like sprinting 
for this horse." . . . Trainer Ron McAnally said he hasn't decided whether 
Bayakoa will run in the Palomar Handicap on Saturday. . . . According to his 
agent, Scotty McClellan, Chris McCarron's return to action has been moved up to 
the end of August. McCarron suffered broken legs and a broken forearm in a 
spill at Hollywood on June 3.

MORNING BRIEFING: COACH GAVE RYAN A RUN FOR NO MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Nolan Ryan was a senior at Alvin High School in Texas, his team lost its 
first two games in district play. 
</P>
<P>
Former Alvin coach Jim Watson told the Houston Chronicle this week: "I made 
them run until they dropped." 
</P>
<P>
Watson feels the punishment might have cost Ryan a hefty bonus. The next day, 
Bing Devine, then the general manager of the New York Mets, made a surprise 
visit to Alvin to see Ryan pitch. Devine was thinking of making Ryan his No. 1 
draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
Watson apologized to Ryan for making him run so much and asked if he could 
pitch. Ryan said yes. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong answer. Watson took Ryan out of the game in the second inning when he was 
trailing, 6-0. The Mets picked Ryan in the eighth round. 
</P>
<P>
Said Watson: "It was the worst he had ever pitched in his life." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which golfer holds the record for most holes in one as a 
professional? 
</P>
<P>
The heat is on: After analyzing his team's recent slump, Boston Red Sox catcher 
Tony Pena is ready to predict the outcome of the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pena: "The main thing is that we've lost all these games and the funny 
thing is we're only one game out. 
</P>
<P>
"In this division, not too many clubs are playing well. Everybody is there. I 
say it's going to be a six-way tie." 
</P>
<P>
Naked reverse: When the Cleveland Browns' training camp opened this week, 
quarterback Bernie Kosar was ready to go. The trouble was, someone had called 
the Browns saying that Kosar had agreed to do a television commercial and would 
need his pads. The caller told the team where to send them. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns sent the pads. The "commercial" turned out to be a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kosar: "They're somewhere in North America. They sent them out about a 
month ago. Supposedly, they're on their way back." 
</P>
<P>
Traffic advisory: Now that Alex Stewart has signed to fight Mike Tyson on Sept. 
22, Stewart's manager, Jim Fennel, has issued a warning to Tyson's people. 
</P>
<P>
Said Fennel: "They think the road back has a little pebble called Alex Stewart. 
Alex Stewart is the dead end." 
</P>
<P>
For show, for dough: For those having trouble selecting just the right golf 
ball, the choice has suddenly become tougher. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Christie's auctioned off a feather-filled ball, made by Allan 
Robertson of St. Andrews, circa 1840, to an English collector for $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
The unused ball was offered in the firm's sale of early equipment and 
memorabilia at St. Andrews, Scotland, during the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
Semantics of the Year: Tuesday, the Major Indoor Soccer League announced its 
1990 rookie of the year and newcomer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
According to the MISL, that's not a redundancy. You see, the former is given to 
the outstanding player in his first year of competition in professional soccer. 
The latter goes to the outstanding player in his first year of competition in 
the MISL. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis Storm forward Terry Brown won the rookie award, and teammate Claudio 
DeOliveira won the newcomer title. 
</P>
<P>
Not the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Art Wall Jr., 37.

CORPORATE SPONSORS LINE UP FOR FESTIVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
With the start of the 1991 U.S. Olympic Festival in Los Angeles less than a 
year away, organizers are still formulating plans and raising money. Wednesday, 
the financial picture brightened considerably with the announcement of five 
additional corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Primrose-Smith, president of the '91 festival, said corporate 
sponsors would be expected to account for $8 million to $9 million of the 
festival's $13-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales are projected to make up the $4-million remainder. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Festival is a multisport competition sponsored by the U.S. Olympic 
Committee and held in every non-Olympic year. The L.A. dates are next July 
12-21 at sites throughout the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Primrose-Smith said tickets would be available in mid-February. She said the 
festival would need more than 9,000 volunteers, plus another 9,000 for the 
event's torch run. JULIE CART

BEUERLEIN HOLDS OUT, SCHROEDER GETS NOD; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: THE RAIDERS' OFFERED THEIR PROFESSED NO. 1 QUARTERBACK LESS THAN HALF 
WHAT HIS BACKUP IS EXPECTED TO RECEIVE.

Steve Beuerlein says he never imagined that a salary disagreement would keep 
him out of the Raiders' training camp. 
</P>
<P>
"You always hear about the holdouts every year and wonder if you could find 
yourself in that situation," the quarterback said. "But I never saw myself 
having any type of a contract dispute." 
</P>
<P>
But Beuerlein has a contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
While the other Raider quarterbacks have been in camp for a week, Beuerlein has 
been working out on his own, along with some of the other five Raider holdouts, 
including running backs Marcus Allen and Steve Smith. 
</P>
<P>
And he has also been playing golf. In fact, the message on Beuerlein's 
answering machine says: "The next best thing to being in camp is being on a 
golf course, which is where I might be." 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein said he feels frustrated that negotiations have dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just tearing me apart sitting here, not being able to be out there with 
the guys getting ready for this year because it's going to be a great year," 
Beuerlein said. "I love the Raiders with all my heart." 
</P>
<P>
But business is business. 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein, who earned $140,000 last season, is seeking a substantial raise. A 
source close to the negotiations said the Raiders offered $400,000 initially 
before raising their offer to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that NFL starting quarterbacks earn an average of $955,943 a season, 
Beuerlein balked at the offer. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' strategy was to sign quarterback Jay Schroeder quickly and get him 
into training camp. Schroeder signed a $1.1-million, one-year contract last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Does Beuerlein want a contract similar to Schroeder's? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not asking for the kind of money they're paying Jay, even though they've 
come out and said that I was No. 1 at the end of the year," Beuerlein said. 
"I'm not asking for $1 million a year, but they're not getting anywhere near 
treating me along the same lines as (Schroeder). 
</P>
<P>
"They basically offered me half of what they offered Jay, and it would be 
stupid for me to go in and sign for half of what they're paying a guy that I'm 
at least going in head-to-head with. I feel that I'm the No. 1 guy and I feel 
my teammates would agree with me." 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein outplayed Schroeder last season, passing for 1,677 yards with 13 
touchdowns and nine interceptions. Schroeder threw for 1,550 yards with eight 
touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Beuerlein was 4-3 as a starter, Schroeder 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
Although Beuerlein ended last season as the No. 1 quarterback and was listed 
first on the off-season depth chart, Raider Coach Art Shell said Schroeder is 
the No. 1 quarterback because he's in camp and Beuerlein isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Does Beuerlein think his holdout has cost him his starting job? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what they're saying or what they're actually meaning," Beuerlein 
said. "A lot of times you can't read these things straight because people say 
things to try to put pressure on you. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at it is that I'm the No. 1 quarterback. And even if I come in 
there and for whatever reasons they have Jay or whoever ahead of me, in my mind 
it's just going to be a matter of time before I get back in there. I look at 
myself as the starting quarterback for the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein hopes that his holdout isn't a distraction for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts me a lot because I'm a team guy," Beuerlein said. "I've never been a 
rock-the-boat type of guy. I would never do anything to distract from my 
teammates and our purpose of winning football games. 
</P>
<P>
"But there comes a time when you've got to stand up for what's fair. And I just 
really feel that I'm not being treated fair right now. I'm not a hard guy to 
please; just treat me fairly." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, who say club policy forbids comment on negotiations, won't comment 
on the talks with Beuerlein. 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein keeps hoping that the contract dispute will be settled soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Even right up until the last day before camp (opened), I really believed that 
there was some way we were going to get things worked out," Beuerlein said. "I 
figured it would be straightened out within a couple days. But it seems like 
things are dragging a little bit, and it's been a lot longer than I would have 
liked. I'd love for it to be resolved within the next day or two because I 
really belong up there." 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein said teammates have been supportive during his holdout. 
</P>
<P>
"Before camp even opened, several of the offensive linemen said they support me 
and told me to do what I had to to," Beuerlein said. "I respect their opinions 
more than anybody because they take care of me. And the rest of the guys feel 
the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Has Marcus Allen played his last game for the Raiders? The South Bay Daily 
Breeze reported that Allen has asked the Raiders to trade him. "No, there was 
no demand," Raider owner Al Davis said. "But it was mutually agreed to trade 
him to the Rams for a certain player, but the Rams turned it down." Added Coach 
Art Shell: "If he still demands to be traded, then I guess that's the way it's 
going to be." . . . Before trading Allen, who earned a reported $1.1 million 
last season, the Raiders would first have to sign him to a contract. One of six 
holdouts, this is the second year that Allen has missed training camp. The 
all-time leading rusher in Raider history, Allen was sidelined by injuries for 
half of the 1989 season and rushed for just 293 yards. With the off-season 
acquisition of tailback Greg Bell from the Rams, Allen became expendable. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Eddie Anderson missed practice Wednesday afternoon because of a 
stomach disorder.

GARRISON, CAPRIATI GET U.S. 3-0 VICTORY OVER BELGIUM

<P>
The United States, led by Zina Garrison and Jennifer Capriati, advanced to the 
quarterfinals of the Federation Cup Wednesday at Norcross, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Only sixth-seeded Italy and eighth-seeded West Germany failed to live up to 
their placement in the draw, falling to Great Britain and the Netherlands, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The United States beat Belgium, 3-0, to set up a quarterfinal meeting with 
seventh-seeded Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison defeated Sabine Appelmans, 6-4, 6-1, and teamed with Gigi Fernandez 
for a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Appelmans and Sandra Wasserman. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati got past Wasserman, 6-0, 7-6 (13-11). 
</P>
<P>
The Czechs, playing without the injured Helena Sukova, defeated Australia, 2-1, 
winning both singles matches. Jana Novotna beat Rachel McQuillan, and Regina 
Rajchrtova defeated Elizabeth Smylie, both 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Britain defeated Italy, 2-1; the Soviet Union defeated Hong 
Kong, 3-0; the Netherlands beat West Germany, 2-1; France ousted New Zealand,

</P>
<P>
Third-seeded John McEnroe beat Grant Connell of Canada, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1, in the 
second round of the Players' International at Toronto after angrily drilling 
his opponent with a ball. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth game of the match, McEnroe got mad at himself for missing a 
volley. He took a full swing at the ball, hitting it into the back of Connell's 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never done that once in all my time hitting balls (in anger)," an 
embarrassed McEnroe said. "I never dreamed I would do something like that." 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, unseeded Todd Witsken upset second-seeded Brad Gilbert, 7-5, 
4-6, 6-2; top-seeded Andre Agassi downed Michael Stich of West Germany, 6-3,

DRIVERS HONOR JONES AND TRY TO BEAT HIM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Norman (Bubby) Jones is hoping for one more flourish in a successful five-week 
run when his peers in the California Racing Assn. sprint car ranks both honor 
him and compete against him Saturday night at Ascot Park. 
</P>
<P>
Although the featured driver this week easily could have been Billy Boat, who 
scored his first Ascot main event victory last Saturday, Jones' runner-up 
finish was also significant, showing that at 49 he can still challenge the 
likes of Boat, 24, and others half his age. To celebrate Jones' hot streak, 
early arrivals at Saturday's race will be given an autographed photo of the 
former two-time CRA champion. 
</P>
<P>
He is in the midst of a streak reminiscent of his heyday in the early 1980s 
when he and retired Dean Thompson dominated the local sprint car ranks for five 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Ol' Bub, as he is known around the track, came out of a two-year retirement 
this season to drive a Clark Drake-built car owned by Larry Henry, a lifelong 
friend who grew up with Jones in Danville, Ill., before moving to California. 
</P>
<P>
Jones and Henry scored their first victory of his comeback during the CRA's 
annual Midwest Tour, when he won at Vermillion Speedway in his old hometown on 
a program honoring him. In addition, he was the top point-winner on the tour 
despite admitting that he was far from being in top shape after his long 
layoff. 
</P>
<P>
Jones started his streak with a third place in a 30-lapper on June 30, then won 
the Firecracker 50 for the third time on July 3, and he has been second in the 
last two main events. 
</P>
<P>
Although his streak is impressive, it is only the latest in a distinguished 
career. In the 1970s, Jones and Rick Ferkel of Ohio were the forerunners of 
what is now known as touring racers. They were on the road all summer, taking 
on all comers on their home tracks and usually coming out on top. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Jones gave up his nomadic existence to compete in the United States 
Auto Club sprint car ranks. He posted 22 USAC victories, including 11 in 1979 
when he led the point standings until the final race of the season before 
losing the championship. He also competed in the 1977 Indy 500, finishing 21st 
after starting last. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, he came West to drive in CRA competition, and is second in 
career victories with 79. Thompson retired with 103. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also set a one-season CRA victory record with 18 in 1983 -- the first of 
his two consecutive championship seasons -- after finishing second three years 
in a row behind Thompson. Oddly enough, his first Ascot victory did not come in 
a sprint car. It was in a midget in 1975, when he won the Turkey Night Grand 
Prix. He is one of only three drivers to win both the CRA championship and the 
Turkey Night midget race. The others are Rick Goudy and Ron Shuman. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' streak is frustrating the four-man group fighting for the title he twice 
held. 
</P>
<P>
Shuman, the defending CRA champion, finished third last Saturday night, with 
Jones' brother-in-law, Rip Williams, fourth and current points leader Brad 
Noffsinger fifth. They are three of the contenders for the 1990 championship, 
along with John Redican, the early-season leader who has been plagued by 
problems lately and failed to finish again last week. 
</P>
<P>
Expected back this Saturday is Lealand McSpadden, a longtime rival of Jones on 
the nation's speedways. 
</P>
<P>
STOCK CARS -- There is a three-way battle for the points lead with only 12 
points -- six positions on the track -- separating Dennis Wooldridge (254 
points), Ed Hale (244) and Larry Lyon (242) heading into Round 15 of the series 
Saturday night. Street stocks, pony stocks and Grand American modifieds also 
will compete on the program. . . . Sportsman, hobby oval and figure-8, 
jalopies, outlaw mini cars and a destruction derby will furnish the action 
Saturday at Saugus Speedway. . . . Marcus Mallet will try for his seventh win 
of the season in Sunday night's pro stock action at Ascot Park. Bomber oval and 
figure-8s plus mini stocks and a destruction derby will complete the program. . 
. . Stock cars will compete Friday night at Ventura Raceway. . . . A 200-lap 
Winston West race set for Aug. 25 at Las Vegas International Speedway has been 
deleted from the schedule and the date given to a rain-postponed event at 
Eureka, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
DRAG RACING -- The Nostalgia Drag Racing Assn. will hold its Santa Ana 
40th-anniversary meet Saturday and Sunday at Los Angeles County Raceway in 
Palmdale. Competition will be in nitro burners, super stocker hot rods, 
flatheads, junior fuelers, altereds and gassers with all machines 1966 vintage 
or earlier. Expected top fuel entries include "Digger Dan," driven by Dan 
Horan; "Nitro Warrior," with Mike Boyd; "Red Turkey," with Jimmy Boyd, and 
"Barely Married," with Bob Hallock. Qualifying runs are scheduled Saturday from 
noon to 10 p.m. Racing starts at 10 o'clock Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
MOTORCYCLES -- Mike Faria of Colton will try to repeat his sweep of last 
Thursday night in tonight's speedway races at Ascot Park's South Bay Speedway. 
His sweep included three handicap races from the 30-yard line and the scratch 
heat, semimain and main event. It was the second time this season that Faria 
won six races. The other time was at Inland Speedway in San Bernardino. It was 
Faria's first victory at South Bay since he won the Speedway Challenge TV 
series in late June. Bobby Schwartz, Phil Collins and Steve Lucero are Faria's 
leading challengers. . . . The second half of the speedway season will begin 
Friday night at Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa with a special first 
division handicap and scratch format, along with the return of wheelie king 
Doug Domokos and an appearance by the PCH skydiving team, which will make a 
night jump onto the race track. . . . The Continental Motosport Club will hold 
its regular Friday night motocross races at Ascot Park. More than 300 amateur 
and professional riders are expected for the California Racing Club's Grand 
Prix races Sunday at Glen Helen OHV Park in San Bernardino. Racing will be held 
on the three-mile off-road and motorcross course. 
</P>
<P>
MIDGETS -- USAC three-quarter cars will perform at Ventura Raceway Saturday 
night. Points leaders Jay Drake, Gary Schroeder, Cory Kruseman and Wiley Miller 
are expected to continue their fight for the season championship in the final 
showing of the TQ's before the 1990 Ventura County Fair program on Aug. 18. 
Schroeder, who swept last weekend's doubleheader at Oildale and Ascot, will be 
after his third straight main-event victory. 
</P>
<P>
PIKES PEAK -- The off-road racing father-and-son team of Roger Mears and Roger 
Mears Jr. of Bakersfield will compete in the 68th annual Pikes Peak Auto Hill 
Climb Sunday. The senior Mears is a past winner, while his son will be making 
his first start in the "Race to the Clouds." The elder Mears will race in the 
stock car class, driving a Camaro for Gary Miller Racing. The younger Mears 
will compete in the open-wheel 1600cc class in a Wells Coyote owned by John 
Galant. 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS CARS -- Nissan teammates Geoff Brabham and Chip Robinson will continue 
their fight for the International Motor Sports Assn. GTP class championship in 
Sunday's G.I. Joe Camel Grand Prix at Portland International Raceway in 
Portland, Ore. Brabham leads Robinson, 148 points to 127; however, both 
finished behind Juan Manuel Fangio II, who gave Dan Gurney's Toyota team its 
second victory of the year at Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma, Calif., two weeks 
ago.

Golf clothes are made from many different materials. Polyester was popular. 
Still is among some golfers. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton is a mainstay. And nylon is used extensively for rain gear. Now, though, 
perhaps it is time to introduce a new fabric to the world of golf: Kevlar, the 
high-density material used to make bulletproof vests. 
</P>
<P>
Pat McDonald of Ventura might be interested in the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen years ago, while McDonald was playing golf with his father at Saticoy 
Country Club in Ventura, a man with a rifle opened fire on a hillside above 
them. McDonald and his father dived into a sand trap. Neither was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy they arrested said he was just shooting at rabbits," McDonald, 30, 
recalled. "They must have been flying rabbits." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, while playing in the Ventura city championships at Olivas Park Golf 
Course, McDonald's round again was interrupted by bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Another golfer from Ventura, Rob Newcomer, told police that as he finished 
putting on the fifth green he heard a gunshot and a bullet slammed into a tree 
several feet from him and his partners, nearly severing a branch from the 
trunk. 
</P>
<P>
"Rob said he screamed and then dove onto the green," McDonald said. "Then he 
heard a few more shots go over his head." 
</P>
<P>
Police were summoned and a Ventura County sheriff's helicopter aided in a 
search of the area. No arrests were made and there are no suspects, Ventura 
police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard the shots as I was going down the first fairway," McDonald said. "I 
didn't think much about it at the time. I remember the sounds the bullets made 
17 years ago when they were going over our heads. They whistled. I didn't hear 
that noise on Sunday, so I wasn't too worried." 
</P>
<P>
Not fazed by the incident, McDonald overcame a bad start -- he bogeyed the 
first hole -- and went on to win the championship by three strokes. He said a 
one-hour delay as police scoured the shrubs for a gunman relaxed him. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for the shooting, I don't think I would have won," McDonald said. 
"I started out playing real bad and was headed for a bad day. But then we had 
the long break and I got to relax and get in a better frame of mind. It 
definitely helped me." 
</P>
<P>
Only a golfer, it seems, would think of gunfire as soothing. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the bullets weren't going directly at me, I wasn't too worried," he 
said. "In golf, you really have to learn to concentrate and block things out. 
And anyway, a lot of worse things can happen to you playing golf than having 
someone shooting at you." 
</P>
<P>
Of course. Ever three-putt from 10 feet? 
</P>
<P>
Pathological golfers: Mitch Voges of Simi Valley, who chased the leaders nearly 
into the clubhouse before settling for third place in last week's Southern 
California Golf Assn. amateur championship, wears a visor and sometimes a pair 
of shorts emblazoned with the logo of Spanish Hills Country Club in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
And Voges, who has a sense of humor as well as a solid golf game, gets a big 
kick out of asking golfers he doesn't know if they have ever played Spanish 
Hills. Often, he said, the answer is yes. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'Yeah, I think I played there once.' " Voges said. "I just smile." 
</P>
<P>
Voges smiles because he knows that anyone who already has played the Spanish 
Hills golf course must have had a chain saw in his golf bag and must have 
driven a bulldozer instead of a golf cart. Spanish Hills, you see, is still a 
thick patch of forest and vines and sagebrush. 
</P>
<P>
Groundbreaking began just a few weeks ago on the $150 million golf course and 
surrounding home sites. The course will be ready, according to Voges, the 
project's membership director, in the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The course site is in the hills of Camarillo, across the Ventura Freeway from 
the Camarillo Airport. The course designer is Robert Cupp, who worked as Jack 
Nicklaus' main course designer for more than a decade, overseeing the 
construction of such noteworthy courses as Memorial in Ohio, Castle Pines in 
Colorado and Shoal Creek in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
The course superintendent at Spanish Hills will be Billy Fuller, the former 
superintendent at famed Augusta National in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
All of this won't come cheaply. The 450 memberships will be offered in 
September starting at $50,000. More than 100 people already have signed up. 
What they will get, according to Voges, is a 45,000-square-foot clubhouse, 
swimming pools, tennis courts and a full health spa. 
</P>
<P>
And a championship golf course. 
</P>
<P>
"National Geographic magazine had an article two years ago naming the cities 
with the best climates in the world," Voges said. "A town in Spain was No. 1, 
and Camarillo was No. 2. Billy Fuller says the weather is just perfect for 
greens and he said we could have the best golf greens in the western United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"And although the course is in hilly country, six of the 18 holes will be 
relatively flat. The other holes will have the typical style of Robert Cupp, in 
that the balls won't be rolling off the fairways all day. He believes that 
fairways and greens should not repel golf balls, as is the case at many new 
courses. This will be a course for the members." 
</P>
<P>
Missing links: Dave Berganio of Sylmar, a former winner of the Los Angeles city 
championship, was ousted from the U. S. Public Links championships in Portland, 
Ore., in the second round of match play last week. 
</P>
<P>
Berganio, 21, lost to Bob Baker of Little Rock, Ark., 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
Back of the pack: Only one local player was even within one-iron distance of 
the winners in last week's Junior World championships in San Diego. Heidi 
Voorhees of North Hollywood shot rounds of 75-78-79-74 for a total of 306 in 
the senior girls' division. She finished 18 strokes behind winner Lisa Kiggens 
of Bakersfield.

The Mike Tyson-Alex Stewart heavyweight fight that promoter Don King announced 
for Sept. 22 at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, N.J., is the final one of an 
eight-bout, $26.5-million deal that Tyson had with HBO. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Seth Abraham, HBO's sports boss, and King are talking about 
another multi-fight agreement for the former heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes according to plan, it would start with Tyson fighting for the title 
once more against the winner of the Buster Douglas-Evander Holyfield 
championship bout. 
</P>
<P>
King said he had assurances from all three sanctioning organizations that 
because of "the error in Tokyo," involving the alleged long count Douglas got, 
Tyson would be the mandatory challenger for the Douglas-Holyfield winner.

The NFL is expected to announce the two cities to be awarded expansion 
franchises Friday, with the new teams beginning play in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cities that have been pursuing professional football teams are 
Jacksonville, Baltimore, St. Louis, Memphis and Charlotte, N.C. Oakland would 
also be interested in an expansion team if the Raiders decide not to return 
there from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best news we've heard since we started in the NFL derby," Arthur 
(Chick) Sherrer, leader of Jacksonville's expansion efforts, told the Florida 
Times-Union. "This formal process makes expansion a definite reality." 
</P>
<P>
The expansion process was officially put in motion at the NFL owners' meeting 
in March when Commissioner Paul Tagliabue named realignment and expansion 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
The league's last expansion was in 1976, when it added Tampa Bay and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
An owners' meeting scheduled to be held in Chicago today was called off, and 
any matters that require a vote will be done by telephone.

KRONE RETURNS -- WITH A WINNER

Breaking her left arm in four places and being sidelined eight months has not 
changed Julie Krone on the race track. 
</P>
<P>
When the world's best female jockey rides, she often wins. 
</P>
<P>
Krone returned to thoroughbred racing in storybook fashion Wednesday at 
Monmouth Park as she guided an undistinguished 3-year-old maiden to victory in 
her first race since breaking her left forearm in a career-threatening spill in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy," Krone said after posting her 1,900th career victory one day 
after her 27th birthday. "It's not so much a sense of relief as much as 'Wow, 
can I still do it?' and 'I can still do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
There was little doubt of that after her return ride on Two Ques. She got the 
filly out of the gate fast, fought off two challengers on the backstretch and 
then took command, winning by 5 3/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
In typical Monmouth Park fashion, the patrons made Krone's horse the even-money 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"Good luck, Julie" was the common wish expressed by more than a dozen people in 
the paddock area before the race and cries of "You're the best" rose from the 
masses after the race. 
</P>
<P>
Krone heard some of them, even though she had other things on her mind in the 
moments after her first race since the spill aboard My Rolin at the Meadowlands 
Racetrack on Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best walk back, I've ever had," said Krone, who also took her 
time getting Two Ques back to the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
All the horses Krone rode Wednesday ran well. She won the fifth race with 
Gandad after a stirring stretch duel with Dino Mike in which jockey Art Madrid 
and Krone bumped at least once. Krone also finished third in the fourth race 
with Ampart Slew and sixth in the eighth with Castle Dell.

CHARGER KICKERS: WHO'S WHO; 
</P>
<P>
THREE TRAVELED LONG, SIDEWINDING ROADS TO THIS CASTING CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The story of an NFL kicker can be one of many twists, not all of them 
enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
Kick a game-winning field goal in overtime, and you are carried off on your 
teammates' shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Have a bad game the next Sunday, and the tryout call for your replacement goes 
out for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
For kickers, patience is not always a virtue, it's a myth. 
</P>
<P>
Some kickers make a career with one team; some, such as a George Blanda, even 
become football legends. But most have brief and nomadic careers. 
</P>
<P>
The ones with jobs and the ones without never completely unpack their bags. 
</P>
<P>
They come in all shapes, sizes -- short, tall, thin, fat. They kick in all 
styles and ways -- barefooted, straight-on, sidewinder. They hail from all 
around the globe -- Europe, South America, North America. 
</P>
<P>
The position is football's melting pot. 
</P>
<P>
The three kickers the Chargers have assembled at their UC San Diego training 
camp are no different. 
</P>
<P>
There is John Carney, a soccer-style kicker who hails from West Palm Beach, 
Fla., via Notre Dame. Tall and lean at 5-feet-11 and 170 pounds, Carney also 
bears a facial resemblance to Jim McMahon, the team's controversial former 
quarterback. Apparently, no one is holding that against him. 
</P>
<P>
There is Fuad Reveiz, another soccer-style kicker who was born in Columbia, 
moved to Miami, went to college at Tennessee and does sports television work 
for a worldwide Spanish network. Strong and compact at 5-11, 216 pounds, he is 
the most experienced, with four seasons with the Miami Dolphins behind him. 
</P>
<P>
And there is Tom Whelihan, a barefooted sidewinder who was born in Maryland but 
raised in Texas, which still thinks of itself as its own country. With his 
size-11EEE feet, Whelihan packs a Texas-sized wallop with his strong leg. 
</P>
<P>
All are trying to fill a spot that has been a point of inconsistency since Rolf 
Benirschke was traded before the 1987 season. In that time, the Chargers have 
gone through Vince Abbott, Jeff Gaffney, Steve DeLine and Chris Bahr. All since 
have been cut, which brings the team to its current state: a league-wide 
casting call that has been slimmed down to a three-way race. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning has given the early edge to Reveiz because of his experience. 
But Henning has been quick not to rule out the other two. 
</P>
<P>
Each has taken a different road to the Chargers. Here are their stories, in 
alphabetical order: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOHN CARNEY 
</P>
<P>
Carney, who came to the Chargers from Tampa Bay in Plan B free agency, might be 
best known for his final college field goal. His 19-yarder gave Notre Dame a 
38-37 victory over USC in 1986 and ended Ted Tollner's tenure as the Trojans' 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Now, by coincidence, Carney finds himself reunited with Tollner, the Charger 
quarterbacks coach. He hopes that, too, will not be held against him. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him in his office back at the stadium, and we had a couple of chuckles," 
Carney said. "He said, 'I remember a few of your kicks, one in particular.' But 
I think Timmy Brown did more in that game than I did, for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Since that game, Carney has worked to find a permanent spot in the NFL. He 
started with Cincinnati in 1987 but was waived during camp. He joined the 
Buccaneers' strike team a few months later. He was cut by the Bucs before the 
1988 season but returned to kick in the final four games, making two of five 
field goal attempts, two of which were blocked. He handled kickoffs in just one 
game, the next-to-last, for the Bucs last season before he was left unprotected 
in Plan B. 
</P>
<P>
Carney's experience bouncing on and off rosters is not unique among NFL kicking 
aspirants. Neither is the way he spent much of his time between kicking jobs, 
taking on part-time work to help pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
He spent one six-month period working for a beer distributor in Florida, 
servicing bar taps. He had another job doing general work at a Florida golf 
course, including driving the tractor that scooped up range balls. 
</P>
<P>
"The jobs that are decent jobs are too time-consuming," Carney said, "or the 
employer just does not want to take the risk of training you when he knows that 
in your heart if you get a call for a tryout Monday, you're going to go." 
</P>
<P>
Carney is hoping this stop with the Chargers will put an end to that kind of 
life. He said he decided to sign with the team because of the promise of a 
wide-open competition. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my primary criterion," Carney said. "I had an opportunity to go to 
Kansas City or back to Tampa. In fact, Tampa said they would match any offer. 
But I just felt this was a great opportunity with them not bringing back Chris 
Bahr." 
</P>
<P>
Carney is described by Larry Pasquale, special teams coach, as being the best 
stylist of the three Charger kickers. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the cleanest kicking style," Pasquale said. "He gets great lift on the 
ball. He just sweeps the ball off the grass. He is so consistent. If he kicked 
50 balls, they would all land four or five feet apart." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FUAD REVEIZ 
</P>
<P>
Reveiz has come the longest to get here, but his most important travels were 
done before the age of 11. That was when his family immigrated to Miami from 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Reveiz said his mother, who worked in the U.S. embassy in Bogota, got a job 
with an airline in Miami, and the family followed. 
</P>
<P>
A soccer player since his boyhood, Reveiz was introduced to football in Miami. 
By high school, he was playing soccer and kicking on the football team. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to American school in Bogota, so it wasn't so hard to communicate with 
kids," Reveiz said, "but what was really hard for me back then was I had a 
really bad accent. I can still remember, and it brings a lot of pain to me." 
</P>
<P>
Reveiz was a popular player in Miami, with its large Columbian population, and 
reported on the Dolphins for Spanish television. But his career in Miami began 
to come to an end in 1988 when he tore a leg muscle during a mid-season game 
against the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
He injured the leg further by returning too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember my first game back was against the Jets, and if I had to try a 
field goal the fourth quarter, there would have been no way," Reveiz said. "I 
finished the last four games in just unbelievable pain." 
</P>
<P>
When Reveiz was unable to compete for his job in the 1989 training camp, was 
placed on the injured reserve list for the season. 
</P>
<P>
He said he choose the Chargers over Dallas and Philadelphia in part because he 
thought the team would be willing to make a choice on a kicker and stick with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Place-kickers are human also, whether people want to believe that or not," 
Reveiz said. "But you have got to feel you have some support. If you go to a 
place where the ax is right over your neck, you better not miss one, or you're 
out of here. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all going to be human. Quarterbacks are going to miss a throw, and 
receivers are going to drop it once in a while, but you can't do it all the 
time. You have to create an environment. But how can you create an environment 
if two weeks down the road, you're out of that city." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOM WHELIHAN 
</P>
<P>
If Whelihan makes it big, it has the makings of a real Hollywood-style tale. 
</P>
<P>
No, Whelihan wasn't discovered in a drug-store soda fountain but in the press 
box at the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Whelihan, who kicked a 62-yard field goal as a junior at Missouri, had been out 
of pro football since he was cut by Green Bay during their 1988 training camp. 
When the Packers went through five kickers that season and never called him 
back, he became all but convinced his dream of a pro football career was over. 
</P>
<P>
"For a month afterward, I couldn't sleep," Whelihan said. "Everything was taken 
away from me. You realize that it is over. A lot of feelings go through your 
body. You wonder if you really want to do this again or do you want to get on 
with your life or do I want to be one of these NFL junkies who are around seven 
or eight years and at 30 have nothing to show for their lives? All those 
feelings went through my mind, and I just said, 'The heck with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Whelihan took a job as a substitute teacher and coach, but when he came across 
Colorado Coach Bill McCartney at a high school all-star game, the idea of his 
taking a job as a graduate assistant was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
He spent a season at Colorado helping out, but it wasn't until he was sent to 
run some film upstairs before the Buffaloes' Orange Bowl game against Miami 
that his break came. There he ran into Bobby Beathard, then working as a 
television commentator with NBC. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran into him and said, 'Hey, I know who you are. You're Bobby Beathard,' " 
Whelihan recalled. "I asked him what I needed to do get back into the NFL. And 
he was great about it. He told me everything I needed to do." 
</P>
<P>
When Beathard was named Charger general manager a few days later, Whelihan 
followed up with a call to the Chargers. When a scout stopped in Boulder to 
work out running back J.J. Flannigan -- eventually drafted by the Chargers in 
the eighth round -- he took a look at Whelihan. The next thing Whelihan knew, 
he had been offered a free-agent contract. 
</P>
<P>
Whelihan has made an impact. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom has a tremendously lively leg," Pasquale said. "The ball explodes off his 
foot. After three kicks, his foot is as red as beet. He blasts that ball." 
</P>
<P>
Whether that is enough to convince the Chargers to keep him will be played out 
over the next few weeks. But for now, Whelihan, like the others, is content to 
know that the job is open. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to realize there are only 28 jobs like this in the world and 75 to 
80% of them are sewn up every year," Whelihan said. "Then you have to realize a 
couple jobs may be open if the guy has a bad preseason. I really don't recall 
many places where they have no one coming back, and they don't know who the 
kicker is. It is a big-time golden opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>

No practice will be held at UCSD today, because the Chargers will scrimmage and 
drill with the Rams at 7 tonight at Capistrano Valley High School. Mostly 
rookies and free agents will participate, because neither team has all its 
veterans in camp. Ram veterans are to report today, Charger veterans Friday. 
Coach Dan Henning said he expected to hold out several veteran players from the 
scrimmage, including quarterbacks Billy Joe Tolliver and David Archer, H-back 
Craig McEwen and running back Marion Butts. Tight end Arthur Cox (heal bruise) 
also will be kept out.

MSL, U.S. SOCCER OFFICIALS DISCUSS UNPRECEDENTED COOPERATION

Two old adversaries sat together in the same room at the Sheraton Inner Harbor 
Hotel in Baltimore Wednesday. And they seem to have gotten along. 
</P>
<P>
Officers of the Major Soccer League (until Tuesday the Major Indoor Soccer 
League) and the U.S. Soccer Federation got together to talk about putting aside 
their differences and about the future of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Newman, coach of the Sockers, said it was the first time the USSF has 
bothered to talk cooperatively to any professional soccer league in this 
country since he came here from England. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say this is pretty historic," he said. "In the 24 years I've been 
here, I've never seen these two groups be so cooperative. I'm very encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
There is one main reason for the change of heart. FIFA, the sport's 
international governing body -- which hates the indoor hybrid -- pushed the 
USSF into cooperating with the torch-bearer of indoor soccer when it mandated 
that a professional outdoor league be in place before this country can play 
host to the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the MSL is the only professional soccer league with financial 
backing and front-office personnel that meets FIFA's standards. And it seems 
willing to play a limited outdoor schedule "not within the next 12 months, but 
quite possibly within the next 24 months," Socker owner Ron Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
As the only professional soccer league sanctioned by the USSF, the MSL will 
cast one-third of the votes at USSF elections scheduled for Aug. 5 in Orlando. 
Werner Fricker, current president of the USSF and running for reelection in 
August, was in Baltimore for the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler made it known that the MSL wants cooperative leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be using our voting strength to forge a closer working relationship 
with the USSF in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
USSF officials were on their way to Milwaukee for a U.S. team exhibition and 
not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Newman might have triggered the dialogue with the USSF in February when, during 
the league's All-Star break, he suggested the best American players from his 
league play the U.S. national team in a three-game series, the winner advancing 
to the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The USSF ignored him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they thought I was being a bit arrogant," he says now. "We knew we 
weren't going to go to the World Cup. We weren't prepared for that, but they 
didn't know that. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I had seen a red flag, a problem, and I was really trying to help. I 
thought that they wanted some games where the result was critical to them, 
where they would be playing under intense pressure and they would be making 
decisions under intense pressure. The players would suddenly find it much more 
difficult to kick the ball and make decisions because they would be facing the 
possibility of not going to the World Cup. They didn't face that situation in 
any games (before the Cup), they just played a bunch of exhibitions that didn't 
help anything." 
</P>
<P>
Because there was no dialogue between the two groups, the national team lost a 
chance to secure "the best player in the country," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Brian Quinn, a Socker midfielder known for raising his game at 
playoff time. The native of Ireland could have become a U.S. citizen in April, 
Newman said, in time to play in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"When the USSF heard that, their eyes rolled in their heads," Newman said. 
"They said, 'Well you didn't tell us.' But they didn't ask. The doors of 
communication just weren't open." 
</P>
<P>
Newman said he has always been happy to help the U.S. team obtain North 
American Soccer League or MSL players. But he says the federation takes 
advantage of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said he still resents the way the USSF prepared the national team 
for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Newman loaned the team three players from 
the Sockers -- Kevin Crow, Hugo Perez and Jean Willrich. 
</P>
<P>
"Then they turned around and actually kidnapped our players," Newman said. 
"They didn't send them back as promised, and all of a sudden we had to play our 
games three players short." 
</P>
<P>
But after Wednesday's discussion, those kinds of problems may have been 
alleviated. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us they wanted to use our players if they were made available more 
easily," Newman said of Wednesday's meeting, which was attended by both Fricker 
and U.S. team Coach Bob Gansler. "Well, we want them to use our players, and we 
will do everything we can to make them available, providing we get the right 
notice." 
</P>
<P>
Added MSL Commissioner Earl Foreman: "We want our players on the national team. 
That will be good for us, good for the players and good for this country." 
</P>
<P>
The first move toward cooperation between the two groups will be a two-game 
series between an MSL select team and the U.S. team. Newman said they are 
tentatively scheduled for some time in September in the Midwest, probably St. 
Louis and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
MSL Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers will have the first and fourth choices in today's MSL draft. They 
received the first as compensation for Keith Weller leaving to coach the Tacoma 
Stars. . . . Commissioner Earl Foreman said the league will expand by at least 
one team before the 1991-92 season. The team will go to Charlotte Hornets owner 
George Shinn and play somewhere in North Carolina. . . . Foreman also said the 
league will announce a new national cable TV deal within 45 days. . . . Several 
rules changes will be instituted before next season. First, the goal will be 
enlarged by two feet in width (to 14 feet) and by a foot in height (to 7 1/2 
feet). As per FIFA standards, all players will now be required to wear shin 
guards. On restarts, defenders will now be required to stand 15 feet from the 
ball instead of the current 10 feet. A three-foul rule will be instituted. If 
any player accumulates three fouls in a half, he will be assessed a two-minute 
penalty.

WALKER LIKELY TO MISS SEASON

Wide receiver Wayne Walker will undergo arthroscopic surgery today to repair 
ligament damage in his right knee and likely will be out for the season, Coach 
Dan Henning said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Walker injured the knee in practice Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The loss is significant for the Chargers, who were counting on Walker to be 
among their top three receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a guy that has outstanding speed and quickness, plus he has been a deep 
threat for us," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker made the team last season as a free agent from Texas Tech after similar 
surgery on his left knee as a senior. He started four games, catching 24 passes 
for 395 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Henning also said offensive guard Mike Simmonds, a Plan B acquisition from 
Tampa Bay, will undergo arthroscopic knee examination today because of an 
ongoing problem. CURT HOLBREICH

RESTAURANT TIE-IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Patrons of the Stanley's restaurants seem to love one of the homemade items 
that don't appear on the menu -- the neckties. 
</P>
<P>
"Our customers ask about them all the time," said Greg Sadofsky, co-owner of 
the restaurants in Sherman Oaks and Woodland Hills. The ties -- worn by the 
waiters, waitresses and busboys -- are brightly colored floral and abstract 
prints on cream-colored material. "The look is what we call 'vogue Hawaiian,' " 
Sadofsky said. "Each one is different." 
</P>
<P>
The ties give Stanley's -- where the chairs are wicker, the walls pastel, the 
light abundant and the menus heavy on salads -- a distinctive look. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our customers want to know if they can buy them," he said. "We tell 
them they are custom-designed just for us." 
</P>
<P>
The designer is Barbara Wozencraft, who has a business in Westlake Village 
called Mr. Monogram. "Basically, I am a commercial artist who got into 
restaurant wear," said Wozencraft, who specializes in aprons and other items 
worn by employees at eateries. You can find her aprons at Brio Restaurant in 
Tarzana, Alice's Restaurant in Malibu and the Lamplighter chain, as well as at 
Stanley's. 
</P>
<P>
She had been making the Stanley's aprons for several years at her shop, where 
she makes use of a computerized embroidering machine, when Sadofsky asked if 
she could create ties, also. 
</P>
<P>
Wozencraft designed the basic form of the tie and farmed out the manufacturing 
of them to a tie factory. As for the distinctive prints, Wozencraft was willing 
to impart a secret. "To tell you the truth, I don't design the patterns," she 
said. "I just go out and find material I like with the patterns already printed 
on them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baby Want Sprouts? 
</P>
<P>
For those who believe that children should be exposed to the world of health 
food at an early age, life is now a bit easier. The Mrs. Gooch's stores have 
equipped some of the carts with bolted-on baby seats, similar to those used in 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard about it last year from a company that manufactures the seats," said 
Vic Sohagi, operations director for the company, which owns seven stores in the 
Los Angeles area, including ones in Sherman Oaks and Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
The seats are placed sideways on top of the carts, where the child seats are 
for older youngsters. "We made two or three of them available at almost all our 
stores," he said. "We are always looking for things like that. In our Thousand 
Oaks store, we have put in a baby-changing station in the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
Sohagi said the seats were a big hit in all but the Beverly Hills store. 
</P>
<P>
"They just aren't being used in that store. I guess there are not too many 
people with babies who shop there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Real Letter Man 
</P>
<P>
Except for just one day, mail carrier George Frost has spent every working day 
since April, 1956, on virtually the same North Hollywood mail route. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen all the changes," said Frost, 55, who is retiring from the Postal 
Service on Aug. 3. "When I started, there were big homes, with swimming pools 
and tennis courts on Weddington Street, in back of where North Hollywood High 
School is. They had cattle and sheep back there for the agriculture students at 
the school, and sometimes one of the animals would get loose and come walking 
down the street. 
</P>
<P>
The area was so bucolic that his route, which included 550 businesses and 
residences, was spread over 7 3/4 miles. "We didn't use cars back then," Frost 
said. "I would just load up my leather bag and walk the entire route." He would 
refill his bag at special mailboxes along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the onset of the apartment house and condominium development, almost 
no single-family homes remain on the route, which has been shortened to about 4 
1/2 miles to accommodate the increased density. "The 12 blocks they took off my 
route are more than enough for a whole other route now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His route begins on Laurel Canyon Boulevard with delivery to the businesses 
between Magnolia and Chandler boulevards (only three of the businesses on the 
street date from when he began the route). He goes east to deliver to the 
residences on Weddington Street and ends his day among the duplexes and 
townhouses on Ben Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
For those along the route, Frost has provided a rare sense of stability in a 
turbulent city. "I can't believe he won't be coming here anymore," said Shelley 
Herman, who has lived in a Weddington Avenue apartment for 10 years. Frost 
began on the route a year before she was born. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows everyone and what is going on in their lives," Herman said. "When the 
woman's daughter across the street was waiting for her college acceptance 
letters," Herman said, "he would get as excited about the letters coming in as 
she would." 
</P>
<P>
And about that one day he missed: Frost switched to a different route after a 
dispute with his supervisor over the number of deliveries he had to make in a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"The one I tried was even worse," he said. "After just one day, I went back 
home to my old route." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Facing the '90s 
</P>
<P>
At the San Fernando Valley Fair, which just closed Sunday, a sign of the times 
could be found at the face-painting booth. 
</P>
<P>
For $1 you could get a nice little heart painted on your face. For $2 the 
design got a bit more elaborate. But for $3 you could have, right on your face, 
one of the heroes of the 90s: Bart Simpson, a Ninja Turtle or Garfield.

<P>
In the late 1920s severe flooding caused water to break through the Los Angeles 
River's dirt embankment, forming a lake that became part of the land acquired 
by the city for one of the San Fernando Valley's first parks. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Reseda Recreation Center still has the Valley's only lake, complete 
with recreational fishing and a host of wild ducks and geese. When the water 
began receding in the seven-acre lake, the city paved its bottom and began 
stocking it with bass and catfish. 
</P>
<P>
"People can stop their busy lives and take an afternoon to go fishing right in 
the middle of the city," said Joe Medaglia, senior recreation director for nine 
years at Reseda Park. "Throughout the state people know about our lake." 
</P>
<P>
An island in the middle of the lake is a favorite spot for seasonal Canada 
geese and wild mallard ducks. A newly renovated picnic area adjacent to the 
lake offers electrical outlets and floodlights for nighttime recreation. KAREN

Red-hot "The War of the Roses," up two notches to No. 2, may unseat "Steel 
Magnolias" next week as the No. 1 rental on the Billboard chart. "Always," the 
romantic drama starring Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter, moved up two places 
to No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"Family Business," which stars Sean Connery and Dustin Hoffman, climbed to No. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
* Richard Gere's meaty role as the unscrupulous cop in "Internal Affairs" was 
acclaimed by some critics as his best performance. The movie entered the chart 
at No. 21 and could make the rental Top 10.

TWO VIDEOS ON GEN. GEORGE CUSTER'S FINAL BATTLE ARE SCHEDULED TO BE SCREENED IN

Gen. George Custer will make his last stand, twice, Wednesday at the Ray D. 
Prueter Library in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
Lifelong Custer buff Arthur Epstein, whose memorabilia collection is on 
display, is lending the library two video copies of films depicting the famous, 
or infamous, final battle. One video, "Custer's Last Fight," is a 15-minute 
black-and-white re-enactment of the battle. Produced in 1912 for $30,000 by 
Hollywood filmmaker Thomas Ince, it was among the most costly films made up to 
that time. The original had no soundtrack, which has been added in the modern 
version. The role of Custer is played by Francis Ford, older brother of John 
Ford. And, said Senior Librarian Mary Lynch, "promotional material claims that 
some of the Indians in the movie were also in the battle itself." 
</P>
<P>
A second video to be shown, "Red Sunday," was made by the Montana and North 
Dakota historical societies. It's an overview of the battle, with a look at 
battlefield sites. 
</P>
<P>
Showings begin at 7 p.m. and will last about one hour. There is no charge. 
</P>
<P>
More library goings-on: On Wednesday, the Camarillo Library will show three 
films in the next to the last in its series of films for children. The films 
are "A Boy and a Boa," "How to Raise a Puppy" and "Whistle for Willie." The 
free series has drawn impressive crowds, between 35 and 50 children each week, 
Supervising Librarian Sandy Kaplan said. "Some of the children have been 
surprised," Kaplan said. "They've never seen 16 millimeter before. They've 
grown up with video." The first film will be shown beginning at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It must be a real zoo out there . . . what with all the animal titles in movies 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone notice that Ventura County theaters are showing "Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles," "Bird on a Wire," "Fire Birds," "The Bear," "Roller Coaster Rabbit" 
and "Navy Seals" (showing in three theaters, including two in the Mann 
Buenaventura Complex). 
</P>
<P>
And that's not to mention the new release, "Arachnophobia." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of bugs, we thought we'd find out what a pet store operator thought 
about the spider-infested film: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll see it," said Terry Miller, manager of Dr. Roe's Pet 
Headquarters in Santa Paula. "The best spider is a dead spider, I say as I sit 
here looking at my tarantulas." LEO SMITH

LOUISIANA GOVERNOR VETOES ALBUM-WARNING PROPOSAL; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: THE BILL WOULD HAVE REQUIRED CAUTIONARY LABELS ON RECORDS WITH 
'OFFENSIVE' LYRICS. THE RECORDING INDUSTRY AND PARENTS MUSIC RESOURCE CENTER 
APPLAUD THE MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The governor of Louisiana vetoed a bill Wednesday that would have made his 
state the first to require albums with potentially offensive lyrics to carry 
warning stickers. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Buddy Roemer, who also recently vetoed the nation's most restrictive 
abortion bill, announced his decision at a news conference at the Capitol in 
Baton Rouge attended by a cross-section of representatives from the recording 
industry and the head of the Parents Music Resource Center. 
</P>
<P>
"While I agree with the authors of this bill concerning the need to inform 
parents of the content of records purchased by youngsters," Roemer said. "The 
best method of informing the public is through voluntary compliance within 
industry standards, similar to what the movie industry has done with success." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, a broad coalition of industry organizations, retailers, 
concert promoters and recording artists mounted a massive campaign to defeat 
the pending legislation, vowing legal and economic retaliation. Among 
performers who reportedly petitioned the governor were Ray Charles, Dr. John, 
Elton John and Judas Priest. 
</P>
<P>
Roemer said that threatened economic boycotts had not affected his decision. He 
vetoed the bill, he said, because he believed it was an infringement on 
constitutionally protected free speech and would be subject to lengthy court 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he believed that the voluntary labeling plan adopted in May 
by the recording industry was sincere and hoped it would be successful. Under 
the plan designed by the Recording Industry Assn. of America, which represents 
most of the country's major record labels, all association members have agreed 
to sticker explicit albums with a standardized black and white sticker reading: 
"Parental Advisory -- Explicit Lyrics." 
</P>
<P>
Roemer warned, however, that if the current industry plan fails to address the 
state's concerns regarding explicit lyrics, the record labeling controversy is 
bound to resurface in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue will not go away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Berman, president of the recording association, applauded the governor at 
the news conference: "Gov. Roemer's veto is a vote of confidence for parents. 
Parents who have the right and the responsibility to raise their children as 
they see fit." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, 
told The Times after his appearance at the session that the veto was a bold 
move: "I felt is was a very courageous political decision. The extreme 
polarization that would have taken place in the state of Louisiana, had he 
signed this bill, would have been devastating." 
</P>
<P>
Tipper Gore, president of the Parents Music Resource Center, said at the news 
conference that her group also supported Roemer's veto: "We all recognize the 
concern to protect children from violent ad explicit messages. But we don't 
want government to legislate that concern. We need parents committed to their 
children, concerned enough to be aware and get involved." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, sponsors of the bill in the Senate used a film about "offensive" 
rock music produced by the resource center and read excerpts from "offensive" 
lyrics provided by Gore's group to woo the votes of undecided senators. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which passed the Senate on July 6 and was approved by the 
House of Representatives on July 7, targeted lyrics that advocate or encourage 
sex, substance abuse, violence and other subjects "potentially harmful to 
minors." 
</P>
<P>
Under the vetoed bill, retailers, distributors and manufacturers selling a 
labeled recording to an "unmarried person under the age of 17" could have been 
fined up to $1,000 and jailed up to six months. The sale of unlabeled albums to 
minors could have brought fines up to $5,000 for producers as well as 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature adjourned July 9 and is not scheduled to return until April. A 
special legislative session would have to be called to override Roemer's veto. 
</P>
<P>
State Rep. Ted Haik, the bill's author, could not be reached for comment.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: ADVERTISERS COOLING OFF TO HOT TOPICS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: ABC'S REFUSAL TO RERUN SHOWS ON SENSITIVE ISSUES MAY INDICATE A NEW 
RELUCTANCE BY THE NETWORK TO TACKLE CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS. 
</P>

<P>
Why isn't ABC rerunning a "China Beach" episode about abortion this summer? 
</P>
<P>
"China Beach's" producers are under the impression that fear of again losing 
advertisers over the episode's abortion theme -- which prompted a number of 
sponsors to withdraw when it aired Jan. 31 -- prompted ABC to reject it as a 
summer rerun. 
</P>
<P>
"Call it what you like, but it's censorship," charged producer Lydia Woodward, 
blaming advertisers even more than ABC. "There's something even more insidious 
about it when it doesn't even have the pretense of the moral high ground. It's 
dollars-and-cents censorship." 
</P>
<P>
ABC has already acknowledged that economics motivated its withholding from 
summer reruns a controversial "thirtysomething" episode showing two gay men in 
bed after sex. ABC says sponsor defections cost it more than $1 million when 
the episode ran in November. 
</P>
<P>
And sponsor flight from the "China Beach" episode cost ABC $780,000, the 
network said. 
</P>
<P>
However, economics are "simply not a factor" in the "China Beach" case, said 
Bob Wright, vice president for communications. "No matter how it looks, that's 
the wrong conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
Although ABC deserves credit for airing the "China Beach" and "thirtysomething" 
episodes in the first place, its reasons for excluding them from summer reruns 
are significant in light of concern about what some perceive to be growing 
influence by advertisers on program content against a background of their 
increased vulnerability to pressure groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertisers are becoming increasingly powerful in deciding what kinds of 
issues get dealt with in entertainment," said Kathryn C. Montgomery, author of 
"Target: Prime Time," a book about pressures on television from advocacy 
groups. Moreover, such pressure groups as the Rev. Donald Wildmon's 
boycott-minded American Family Assn. "have created a new climate of fear that 
has obviously had an impact on sponsor behavior," Montgomery added. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of that fear is not always easy to measure. 
</P>
<P>
Although the "China Beach" producers regard the abortion episode, titled 
"Holly's Choice," as one of their stronger efforts of the season, it "just 
didn't make the cut" when it came to choosing summer reruns, Wright said. One 
reason, he said, was that there would not have been enough "rest" between the 
summer rerun date and the episode's original Jan. 31 airdate. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, though, the "rest" test was not applied to four non-controversial 
"China Beach" episodes that did "make the cut" -- despite first airing after 
"Holly's Choice." 
</P>
<P>
Two of those were chosen because they flowed into the new season, Wright said. 
And the other two? "I'm assuming they were chosen because they were better 
episodes" than "Holly's Choice," said Wright, who did not discount the 
possibility that the abortion episode would be rerun after this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"China Beach" is set in Vietnam before Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme 
Court decision giving women a legal right to abortion. That "Holly's Choice" 
should be at all controversial is absurd given its sensitive, extremely 
measured depiction of a "China Beach" character's decision to have an abortion 
and of her resulting physical and emotional trauma. Although "China Beach" 
protagonist Colleen McMurphy states her own opposition to abortion, the episode 
itself takes no position. 
</P>
<P>
But this did not stop some advertisers from jumping, giving a neon upbeat 
message to pressure groups and a grim one to ABC. 
</P>
<P>
When "China Beach" in June sent ABC a list of episodes it wanted on the summer 
rerun schedule, said co-executive producer John Wells, all but "Holly's Choice" 
were accepted. Wells said that Billy Campbell, director for current drama 
series, told him that the episode was "something the sales department would 
have a lot of difficulty with, and they really didn't want to run it." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, producer Carol Flint, who wrote "Holly's Choice," sent a 
letter to ABC Entertainment President Robert Iger on behalf of the show's 
producers, imploring the network to change its mind about not rerunning the 
episode this summer. Flint noted that the episode "won its time slot . . . and 
elicited more viewer response -- overwhelmingly positive -- than any other 
episode we've broadcast this year." 
</P>
<P>
Flint said that Iger has not responded to her letter. Wright said that Iger 
felt the letter "did not require an answer." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, when ABC subsequently told the producers that the network had 
decided to add two episodes to the initial summer rerun list, the producers 
again submitted "Holly's Choice." 
</P>
<P>
"A phone call came back from Billy Campbell very quickly suggesting that we 
pick something with broader appeal," Woodward said. "He ticked off some other 
episodes. He also said words to the effect that we can kind of fight this. I 
think he meant programming (the department) could fight it. And I said, 
'Let's.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Woodward, Campbell soon called back again, saying, "This is really 
going to be difficult." So, she added, "We all decided to move on." 
</P>
<P>
If Campbell indicated to the producers that the decision to exclude "Holly's 
Choice" from summer reruns was related to its abortion theme, Wright said, "He 
did not, I am assured, ever check that with his boss or his boss's boss." 
</P>
<P>
A call to Campbell's office was unreturned by press time. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, all of this tolls ominously at a time when the National Endowment 
for the Arts is under attack by Wildmon's group and others, and freedom of 
expression in general is under siege. 
</P>
<P>
"We're revisiting the Eisenhower years," said "China Beach" executive producer 
John Sacret Young, who sees something "worrisome" and potentially "dangerous" 
in the controversies over the "thirtysomething" and "China Beach" episodes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Young insists that this incident will put no chill on his own show's 
creative process, there's no telling what kind of subliminal self-censorship 
occurs in the minds of writers or producers. 
</P>
<P>
What especially worries Young and other producers is the process by which 
professional screening firms or advertising agencies preview TV programs -- 
occasionally as late as the day they air -- and then report back to their 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been going on since the dawn of television, and the latest wave of 
producers have just discovered it," said Jack McQueen, senior vice president of 
the advertising agency of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications Inc. "If a 
problem arises, the agency brings that to the attention of the advertiser and 
then a decision is made to either stay in the show, move the commercial within 
the show or pull from the show completely." 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of so many pressure groups, however, the stakes seem higher 
now, and advertisers -- always the weak link in the commercial TV process -- 
are more skittish than in years. Most advertisers aren't concerned about the 
First Amendment. They're concerned about dollars, and many special-interest 
groups know just the right pressure points. 
</P>
<P>
"Any individual has the right to complain about something they don't like," 
"Target: Prime Time" author Montgomery said. "What I worry about is that these 
groups have a broader agenda to restrict debate, to attack media and cultural 
institutions throughout our society, to narrow the range of issues and to 
censor. They want nothing about homosexuality, for example." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. While not recalling "Holly's Choice," Wildmon claimed that a mass 
mailing to advertisers by his organization had a lot to do with sponsors 
bolting the "thirtysomething" episode with gay bedmates. "Feedback from 
advertisers and people inside the network led us to believe our letter had some 
impact," he said from his Tupelo, Miss., office. 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon, whose group organized boycotts last year against the Mennen Co. and 
Clorox for sponsoring programs it deems anti-Christian and too sexy, violent 
and profane, defended his methods. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is mainstream America. The network can show what they want to 
show, the advertisers can sponsor what they want, the viewer can watch any 
programs they want, and the consumers can spend his money where he wants. 
That's American as apple pie. People boycott California grapes and nobody says 
anything. Don't deny us our freedom because every now and then we may be 
effective." 
</P>
<P>
Just how effective is always debatable. 
</P>
<P>
"The interesting thing is that Wildmon has had tons of boycotts, but never have 
any of them had any effect whatsoever," claimed Horst Stipp, director of social 
and development research for NBC. "The people (pollsters) at Roper found out 
last year that even though Wildmon was boycotting some companies, less than 2% 
of the people even knew of the boycotts." 
</P>
<P>
For some advertisers, however, even the barest whiff of controversy is 
terrifying. Stipp: "There is always the possibility that with someone like 
Wildmon, who gets tremendous press and has good financial resources, you are 
going to get some bad publicity and thousands of letters, and that is something 
advertisers want to avoid. So they opt for not taking that risk." 
</P>
<P>
The irony, he said, is that NBC research shows a "strong majority" of viewers 
approve of TV dealing with controversial issues, and that these themes have "no 
negative rub-off on the environment of advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Too often, however, it's the vocal minority's voice that speaks loudest to 
advertisers. And now it seems to be echoing through the summer.

A FLOCK OF ROBINS; 
</P>
<P>
PRODUCERS RUSH PROJECTS BUT A CULLING IS EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Robin of Locksley may be one of the Western world's most enduring heroes, and 
post-Reagan America may be the ideal audience for a story about an outlaw who 
robs from the rich and gives to the poor. But will American moviegoers sit 
still through three different Robin Hoods next summer? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. That's why Morgan Creek's coup this week in locking up Kevin 
Costner for the lead in its project, "Prince of Thieves," has sent two rival 
studios into paroxysms of doubt about their own Robin Hood films. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the middle of our process" of deciding where to go on "The 
Adventures of Robin Hood," said Fox production chief Roger Birnbaum. "One of 
the other companies has announced the signing of a major star and that has 
given us pause . . . I still have a magnificent screenplay. We may make it in 
the immediate future or in a couple years." 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Star chief Mike Medavoy said he would only proceed on his project, "Robin 
Hood," if he can find the right cast -- and soon. "I wouldn't do this if we 
were not the first one out," he said. That will be tough to do, since Morgan 
Creek is already in preproduction, with cameras ready to roll on Sept. 3, and 
has moved up its release date from next summer to spring in order to beat its 
rivals to theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Medavoy added, "I've been a big fan of the (1938) version. It's a picture I've 
seen more times than any I can think of. This was the picture that really got 
me enthralled with movies. That's why it's difficult to part with this." 
</P>
<P>
"The Adventures of Robin Hood," Warner Bros.' first Technicolor release, 
remains one of the most popular movies shown on TV today. The 1938 film -- a 
big-budget production at $2 million -- won three Academy Awards and etched 
indelibly in the minds of movie fans the face of 28-year-old Errol Flynn as 
Robin Hood. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been more than a dozen other attempts to bring the 12th-Century 
English legend to the screen, including a 1952 Disney version called "The Story 
of Robin Hood"; the 1950 "Rogues of Sherwood Forest" with John Derek as Robin 
Hood; a forgettable 1968 film called "A Challenge for Robin Hood"; and the 1976 
love story "Robin and Marian" starring Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn as the 
aging couple. 
</P>
<P>
Connery's son, Jason, starred in a recent Robin Hood TV series on Showtime. 
Other TV series include "The Adventures of Robin Hood," which aired in the 
1950s, and a 1975 Mel Brooks satire, "When Things Were Rotten." 
</P>
<P>
While each of the current three scripts sets its own tone, there are enough 
similarities to raise serious questions about whether audiences will want to 
see more than one Robin Hood movie. 
</P>
<P>
All three are period-piece dramas -- set against the brutality of 12th-Century 
authorities toward the peasant population -- with Robin Hood as hero and Maid 
Marian as his lover. And all three attempt to explain why Robin Hood became an 
outlaw hiding out in the Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Creek's "Prince of Thieves" opens with Robin Hood's daring escape from 
an Arabic prison where he has been held for five years, and shows his return to 
England where the infamous Sheriff of Nottingham is brutalizing the population. 
The story is laced with glimpses of pagan rituals and offers a dagger-wielding, 
feminist version of Maid Marian as well as a big, brooding Arabic sidekick to 
Robin. 
</P>
<P>
The $40-million production, directed by Kevin Reynolds ("Fandango," "The 
Beast"), brings together a design team that includes production designer John 
Graysmark ("Gorillas in the Mist"); art director Alan Tomkins, who earned an 
Oscar nomination for "The Empire Strikes Back"; set decorator Peter Young, who 
won an Oscar for "Batman," and director of photography Doug Milsome ("Full 
Metal Jacket").

In Fox's "The Adventures of Robin Hood," to be directed by John McTiernan -- a 
filmmaker known for his action sequences in films like "Die Hard" and "The Hunt 
for Red October" -- the central character is Sir Robert Hode. This young Saxon 
noble is more interested in wine and women -- until the threat of a lashing by 
the Norman authorities sends him racing to the woods. The script was written by 
Mark Allen Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three projects, Tri-Star's "Robin Hood" most closely follows the 1938 
version. But the screenplay, written by "thirtysomething's" Susan Shilliday, 
adds a first act that shows Robin as a young man, with a reputation as a 
"troublemaker . . . but the best shot with a long bow between York and London," 
as the Sheriff of Nottingham put it. It is in the course of avenging his 
father's brutal slaying that Robin eventually becomes a legendary outlaw. 
</P>
<P>
How three different Robin Hood movies landed on studio schedules at the same 
time is anybody's guess. Privately, some of those involved with these projects 
accuse the others of stealing their idea. And two weeks ago, Fox chairman Joe 
Roth went public with his own accusations in an unusual tirade that landed on 
the front page of the industry trade paper Daily Variety. 
</P>
<P>
Roth accused Tri-Star and Morgan Creek of acting "unjustly, if not immorally" 
in putting competing Robin Hood projects into production when the rivals 
allegedly knew that McTiernan was developing a story for Fox. 
</P>
<P>
Roth also attacked the William Morris Agency -- which represents Fox's 
McTiernan and Smith, as well as the two Morgan Creek writers, Pen Densham and 
John Watson. The Fox chairman said the agency obviously knew about the Fox 
project when it engineered the sale of the Densham-Watson script to Morgan 
Creek for $1.2 million last February. The Morris agency declined comment on the 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
Roth's comments caught many in Hollywood by surprise -- not only because of 
their force, but also because Roth was the co-founder of Morgan Creek with its 
current chief executive, James Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe and I are the best of friends," Robinson said when asked about Roth's 
remarks. "When I read that stuff in the papers, I figure it's just a studio 
head talking." Roth declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
McTiernan had been developing the project at Fox for two years, and Fox had 
planned to make the Robin Hood film after the director finished another 
project, "Road Show," said Birnbaum. 
</P>
<P>
Fox also hoped that Mel Gibson would agree to star in the film after he had 
finished "Hamlet" and one other film. Gibson, said Birnbaum, "looked at our 
project and liked it very much. But he was concerned about doing two period 
pieces in a row." 
</P>
<P>
But when it became clear that Tri-Star and Morgan Creek were rapidly moving 
forward on their own Robin Hood projects, Birnbaum said, Fox was forced to jump 
into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
The writers and producers on the other projects deny that they were influenced 
by Fox's screenplay. Ed Zwick, who is producing Tri-Star's "Robin Hood" with 
his "thirtysomething" partner Marshall Herskovitz directing, said the pair 
first tried to pitch a Robin Hood movie in 1985. "The reaction was polite 
disinterest," said Zwick, who directed "Glory" last year. 
</P>
<P>
About two years ago, Shilliday, who is Herskovitz's wife, began writing a 
script, he said. The screenplay was put on hold when she joined 
"thirtysomething" as a writer. At the end of the TV season last year, Zwick 
said, "she took up the pen again. Then she heard about the other projects. But 
she decided she was going to finish come hell or high water." 
</P>
<P>
Zwick added that Shilliday's interest in the Robin Hood legend is not 
surprising. "Marshall and Susan are Anglophiles," he said. "Both are steeped in 
the period and the lore. It was a natural outgrowth." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Creek writer John Watson said he and his partner of 20 years, Pen 
Densham -- both of whom grew up in England -- had been eager to write a Robin 
Hood story for years. In early 1989, he said, Densham came up with a way to 
reinvent the legend. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no influence from any other source," said Watson. "We initiated the 
idea out of our own heads. We heard of one other project in the works (at Fox) 
but we decided to go ahead with ours . . . When you're writing, and you get 
into the creative process, sometimes you just can't stop." 
</P>
<P>
If Roth thought his comments would stall the other projects, he was wrong. Even 
as the Fox chairman was venting his frustrations in Hollywood, scouts for 
Tri-Star and Morgan Creek were in England combing the countryside for film 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
"We've laughed about that," Watson said in a telephone interview from his 
office at Shepperton Studios in London. "What would happen if we were marching 
through the forest and saw the Tri-Star people? We'd have to borrow the Sheriff 
of Nottingham's men." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time several Hollywood studios have produced similar 
movies at the same time. Last year, three different film companies released 
underwater action movies -- "Deep Star Six," "Leviathan" and "The Abyss." "The 
Abyss" was the only film to garner much attention at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 Fox -- the same studio that produced "The Abyss" -- released a 
body-change movie called "Big" that followed a slew of others, including "Vice 
Versa," "Father and Son" and "18 Again." "Big," which was the last to be 
released, was the only hit. 
</P>
<P>
But the sudden Hollywood interest in Robin Hood is more akin to two recent 
films based on the same 18th-Century novel -- "Dangerous Liaisons" and 
"Valmont." "Dangerous Liaisons," starring Glenn Close, did brisk business -- 
particularly for a period piece -- and earned seven Oscar nominations. 
"Valmont," which came out a year later, was virtually ignored, even though its 
director was the highly regarded Milos Forman ("Amadeus"). 
</P>
<P>
Fox marketing chief Tom Sherak, who saw the studio through both "The Abyss" and 
"Big," concedes that multiple Robin Hoods will be a tougher sell. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it does present a problem," Sherak said. "But the key is the filmmaker. 
You tell me that John McTiernan is going to make the movie and I'm going to sit 
up and listen."

TWO SETBACKS FOR PACIFIC AMPHITHEATRE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: A MERGER PLAN WITH RIVAL IRVINE MEADOWS FALLS THROUGH. A JUDGE IMPOSES 
NOISE-LEVEL RESTRICTIONS AT THE COSTA MESA VENUE.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Pacific Amphitheatre's operators have been beaten on two fronts in their 
efforts to stave off noise restrictions and to eliminate profit-sapping 
competition with rival Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Superior Court judge imposed new noise limitations on the 
18,765-capacity rock and pop concert facility on Tuesday, the same day that 
Pacific officials learned that they had lost their bid to acquire a controlling 
interest in their longtime competitor. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of a U.S. Justice Department suit filed last week to stop a merger 
between the two amphitheaters, the consortium of private investors who own 
Irvine Meadows accepted a rival offer that will keep it out of Pacific's 
control. Robert Geddes, a minority shareholder in the 15,000-capacity Irvine 
facility, has teamed with Irving Azoff, a veteran record industry executive, to 
buy "a substantial interest" in Irvine Meadows. As a result, competition will 
continue. The deal is expected to put an end to the government's antitrust 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Amphitheatre is owned by the East Coast-based Nederlander 
Organization, which had hoped by merging with Irvine Meadows to solve both 
problems. If the merger had gone through, Nederlander could have shunted louder 
acts to the more remote Irvine Meadows and offered the Pacific's Costa Mesa 
neighbors softer pop shows. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a merger would have ended fierce bidding wars for top pop and 
rock concert attractions that Pacific officials blamed for driving up the cost 
of business and for losses that they said totaled more than $2 million in 1989. 
According to documents filed in the Justice Department suit, combined revenues 
at the facilities are $13 million to $20 million annually. Each amphitheater 
has presented 35 to 55 concerts a year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new noise ruling, Superior Court Judge Richard J. Beacom ordered 
Pacific officials to keep sound levels within five decibels of the county's 
sliding-scale noise ordinance. Noise from the amphitheater will not exceed 55 
decibels for more than 30 minutes, nor be louder than 75 decibels at any time, 
the judge's order states. 
</P>
<P>
Because there was only one plaintiff in the noise complaint, Costa Mesa 
resident Laurie Lusk, noise levels will be measured from Lusk's property. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific attorney Deborah M. Nesset said that she would have to consult with 
Nederlander officials, but she did not rule out the possibility of an appeal of 
Tuesday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the entrance of music industry magnate Azoff as a new Irvine Meadows 
partner snuffs out the last chance for a merger with the Pacific Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Azoff, former chairman of MCA's Music Entertainment Group, joins Donald Koll, 
one of Orange County's leading developers, and Robert Geddes in a new business 
troika that will control the amphitheater. In accepting a joint bid by Geddes 
and Azoff to acquire what a press release announcing the deal termed a 
"substantial interest" in Irvine Meadows, Koll, who had held a majority 
interest in Irvine Meadows, rejected a rival bid by the Pacific Amphitheatre's 
owners to merge the two facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department stepped in last Thursday to block the proposal, filing 
an antitrust suit that contended joint operation would create an illegal 
monopoly in the Orange County concert market. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hegness, an attorney for Koll, said on Tuesday that the government's 
antitrust filing played a part in determining the outcome as two suitors vied 
to strike a deal with Koll over Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Nederlander, in its bid, had teamed with Ogden Allied Services Corp., which 
operates arenas and entertainment concessions around the country. After that 
offer surfaced in March, Geddes and Azoff parried with a counterbid of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department action "really put us in the position where in order to 
go forward with the Nederlander transaction, we had to step up to a fight with 
the government," Hegness said. "We felt it was a fight better avoided."

STUDY ADVISES AGAINST PLAN FOR A MALL AT TOWNE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An upscale shopping mall in the Towne Center redevelopment area would have 
little chance of success, because the department store business is slow and 
there are not enough high-income residents to support such a mall, a marketing 
report indicates. 
</P>
<P>
Forty of Towne Center's 125 acres near the Artesia Freeway had been earmarked 
for what the city called a "high-end" mall, with a Neiman-Marcus or a Saks 
Fifth Avenue to attract a Mercedes-Benz crowd. 
</P>
<P>
If the council accepts the consultant's conclusion and scraps the mall idea, it 
must find another use for the land and another way to satisfy its desire for 
higher sales tax revenues. The council will discuss the analysis and the future 
of Towne Center at its meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A hotel recently opened at the Towne Center and the city's Community Arts 
Center is under construction. Office buildings are slated to cover most of the 
property, which is in the center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The way to increase sales tax dollars, marketing analysts said, is to 
concentrate on the city's existing mall, Los Cerritos Center at the south end 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Los Cerritos Center is in a position to become what the analysts called a 
"powerhouse" mall, one that attracts volumes of shoppers by virtue of its size 
and variety of retail outlets. Currently the center is in competition with the 
nearby Lakewood Mall of about the same size, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The single-story Los Cerritos Center could be expanded by adding a second level 
and by decking the parking lots, the market report suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members doubted that a second mall in Cerritos could be successful 
and hired Economics Research Associates to conduct the market analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Among the skeptics was Mayor Ann B. Joynt. She said this week that the analysis 
tells her the city should not move too quickly to develop the 40-acre parcel 
but wait until the best possible proposal comes along. 
</P>
<P>
Joynt pointed out that the consultant termed the parcel extremely valuable 
because it has freeway visibility and its own access ramp on a major east-west 
traffic artery. 
</P>
<P>
During her campaign last year, Joynt said she believed the city should turn its 
attention to upgrading Los Cerritos Mall, lest it lose its competitive edge in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The super mall," Joynt said, "is becoming more and more the location for 
success and the small mall is having a tougher time competing." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some cities, Cerritos can afford to go slow on development because it 
has ample tax revenue from Los Cerritos Center and the nearby Auto Square. The 
city has a budget surplus this year of about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
The department store industry is currently in a state of financial turmoil, the 
market analysis contends. "Too many department store operators are competing 
for a slow-growth market, and discounters and specialty retailers continue to 
provide strong competition." 
</P>
<P>
As examples of the turmoil, the analysis pointed out that Macy's has decided to 
delay its expansion into Southern California. The analysis also cited the 
collapse of the Federated Department Stores chain, which owns Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it takes affluent shoppers to keep the more upscale department 
stores in business, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"Support for very high-end specialty retailers (such as Neiman-Marcus, Saks 
Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's) is a very narrow market niche," said the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
While the population within a four-mile radius of Cerritos has solid 
middle-income buying power, there is not a high percentage of households that 
have yearly incomes of more than $75,000, the study said. It takes households 
with that sort of income to support the more expensive department stores. 
</P>
<P>
According to data presented in the market study, the number of households 
within a four-mile radius of Cerritos with incomes over $75,000 is 11.2%. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, around the Fashion Island mall in Newport Beach, the percentage 
is 18.3%, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cerritos . . . area is heavily family oriented, resulting in a lower per 
capita income," the analysts said. "This means that there are relatively fewer 
single people who tend in some markets to be more fashion conscious and spend 
more."

COUNCIL CITES SAFETY IN BAN ON ICE CREAM VENDORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Gate City Council has unanimously approved an amendment to its 
ordinance banning ice cream push carts. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment adds a restriction to keep vendors off city streets because of 
traffic hazards they might create, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
City law already prohibits pushcart vendors who are unable to obtain health 
permits from the Los Angeles County Health Department, City Administrator Bruce 
Spragg said. 
</P>
<P>
Spragg said some vendors recently received health permits, but the council 
wanted to continue banning them from the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council sees this as a public safety issue, the administrator said. The 
carts are especially dangerous for children who run into the streets to buy ice 
cream, he said.

NEIGHBORS OF SPA COMPLAIN OF PARKING TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Montebello Traffic and Safety Commission last week heard requests for 
permit parking from residents who have complained that their streets and 
driveways have been congested by patrons of the nearby Beverly-Wilcox Holiday 
Spa Health Club. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners took no action, but will hold a public hearing Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Montebello residents who live on streets surrounding the Beverly-Wilcox 
shopping center have been seeking relief from the city because they say the 
peace of their neighborhood has been destroyed by the constant traffic of 
health spa patrons who cannot find a place to park in the shopping center lot. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month at a standing-room-only meeting, the City Council ordered 
the spa to re-stripe its parking lot to create more parking spaces, but 
residents and some other businesses in the center complained that too much 
parking is needed, and re-striping will not solve the problem.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER;

<P>
REQUEST TO REMOVE THEATER FROM HISTORIC LIST DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has denied a developer's request to remove the Whittier 
Theatre from its local register of historic buildings. Doerkin Properties Inc. 
had sought the change in status to assist the owner/developer in moving forward 
with plans to raze the 61-year-old structure and construct a 
multimillion-dollar shopping complex. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the State Office of Historic Preservation refused to approve the 
demolition, citing the building's historic value and community support for 
saving it. The theater, which lost money in recent years before being closed, 
was damaged by the October, 1987, Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is between Dr. Doerkin and the state now," said Councilwoman Helen 
Rahder. Before she was elected to the council, Rahder helped lead a two-year 
effort to stop the demolition, which ultimately failed in the courts before the 
state intervened. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert Woehrmann, a past supporter of the demolition, also offered 
little comfort Tuesday night to attorney Charles Cummings, who represented the 
developer at the meeting. Woehrmann noted that the council had no process for 
ruling that a designated historic building was not historic after all.

FIREWORKS BALLOT ISSUE OKD AMID SPARKS ON COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawaiian Gardens City Council has voted 3 to 2 to place a referendum on the 
November ballot to ban fireworks. The action came Tuesday night after a heated 
argument between Mayor H. M. (Lennie) Wagner and Councilwoman Kathleen Navejas 
that drew applause and jeers from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, who opposes fireworks and supports the referendum, demanded order in 
the council chamber and threatened to adjourn the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Navejas opposed the referendum because the $8,000 to $10,000 expense to put it 
on the ballot "should be used elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
"These people who oppose fireworks; let them go out and get signatures and put 
it on the ballot themselves," Navejas said. "Don't make us do the dirty work. . 
. . You don't care about the people in this community." 
</P>
<P>
The audience applauded and the mayor began to bang her gavel and threatened to 
adjourn the meeting if Navejas did not stop. 
</P>
<P>
The two continued to argue until one member of the audience called on Mayor Pro 
Tem Dominic Ruggeri to "take control of the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner later apologized for the quarrel.

RECRUITING DRIVE FOCUSES ON BILINGUAL TEACHERS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: NORWALK-LA MIRADA DISTRICT RECRUITERS TRAVEL WIDELY IN EFFORT TO 
HIRE MORE TEACHERS TO AID GROWING NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH 
ABILITY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With more than 5,000 of its 18,000 students speaking only limited English, the 
Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District is beginning an ambitious plan to 
recruit bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The district needs to hire at least 46 teachers by the time school opens in 
September, and school officials would prefer they be bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
The recruiting plan began this month with a team of administrators traveling to 
Bakersfield, Fresno, Phoenix and several places in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 local and out-of-state colleges and universities have been 
contacted and asked to tell teaching candidates that the district is looking 
for instructors. The district has mailed advertisements to colleges and placed 
ads in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The recruitment plan is the idea of Supt. Robert Aguilar, who was hired in May 
to run the district. With less than two months before school opens, Aguilar 
said it was important that an aggressive recruiting program be started 
immediately and he convinced the Board of Education that there was a need for a 
recruitment team. Only 80 of the district's 640 teachers are bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
"For many years we haven't had more than one person recruiting, but we're sort 
of desperate now. I support this," board President William White said. 
</P>
<P>
The board also approved a $37,700 recruitment budget for the 1990-91 school 
year. The previous year's recruitment budget was $8,500. 
</P>
<P>
The team includes Aguilar, four administrators and three teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the recruiters were in Texas this week, stopping at the University of 
Texas at San Antonio, the University of San Antonio, Pan American University in 
Edinburg and Texas A&amp;I University at Kingsville. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar said he chose the Texas area because it has been his experience as an 
educator that the state trains a large number of bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
During recruiting sessions, Aguilar said, "We will let them know that we have a 
nice place to work. We have the potential to be an exciting school district." 
</P>
<P>
The district's pay scale is better than that of many California districts, 
according to Johnna Moore, administrator of personnel services. The starting 
salary is $25,400 a year for beginning teachers, while a teacher with more than 
24 years of experience makes $49,000. 
</P>
<P>
After the summer, Aguilar said the district plans to continue its aggressive 
effort to hire teachers. Next year, a teacher fair will be held to recruit 
instructors, Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
The fair will be similar to one held last year by the Richmond Unified School 
District in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he was an associate 
superintendent, Aguilar said. "We interviewed more than 1,000 teachers and were 
able to recruit 100," he said.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Balanced-Budget Amendment 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 279 to 150, the House failed to achieve the two-thirds majority 
needed to approve a constitutional amendment (HJR 268) requiring the federal 
government to balance its budget each year. Deficit spending was to have been 
outlawed except during wartime or if three-fifths majorities of the House and 
Senate voted to permit it. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Charles W. Stenholm (D-Tex.) said lawmakers lack "courage and guts" 
to master the deficit and therefore "we need some help, an extra tool. We need 
a balanced-budget amendment." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) said the measure "is filled with soft and fuzzy 
feel-good words that by themselves have no more legislative meaning than a 
bumper sticker that says 'Have a Nice Day.' " 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the constitutional amendment.

Balanced-Budget Statute 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 282 to 114, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 5258) 
requiring that the President and congressional budget committees draft balanced 
federal budgets each year showing the exact spending cuts and revenue hikes 
they recommend to stay out of the red. If Congress votes down the proposals, it 
would then pass a standard deficit-laden budget to run the government. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders produced the bill to counter the GOP plan (above) to balance 
the budget by constitutional amendment. They said it was important for 
balanced-budget advocates to state precisely how they would avoid a deficit. 
But Republicans denounced the bill as political cover for those who voted 
against the constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the Democratic bill.

To Cut Farm Spending 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 202 to 216, the House refused to cut discretionary spending in a 
fiscal 1991 agriculture appropriations bill (HR 5268) by 2% across the board, 
saving $150 million. Exempted from the cut was to have been a nutritional 
program for poor infants and spending mandated by law. The $50.4-billion 
measure (HR 5268) was sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.) said the "very modest" cut would help offset 
the bill's 11.5% increase over 1990 spending. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jamie L. Whitten (D-Miss.) said he believes in a balanced federal 
budget "but not at the expense of sound and essential programs." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the 2% cut.

PARAMOUNT RINK THRIVES DESPITE DROUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: MANY ICE PALACES PLAN TO CLOSE. FORMER MANAGER OF ICELAND SAYS THEY 
CAN BE MONEYMAKERS.

It didn't take long for Nick Nickerson, 72, to make his move. Playing hockey at 
Pickwick Ice Arena, he saw something more tempting than an empty net. Walter 
Stavert, one of Pickwick's owners, had just walked in. 
</P>
<P>
"I skated over," he said, "and asked to talk to him; told him how old I was and 
took off my helmet so he could see my gray hair. When I let him know I'd been 
playing there for years and hoped he would reconsider his decision to close the 
rink, he said, 'Well, we're gonna keep it going.' " 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Kristin Thomas, 11, walked to the mike at a meeting of the 
Burbank Park and Recreation Board and made a slightly different pitch. "I skate 
there all the time," she said. "It's keeping kids off the street." 
</P>
<P>
While many ice rinks are closing in Southern California -- their owners saying 
there are more profitable uses for the property -- the former manager of 
Iceland in Paramount says ice rinks can be profitable if they are properly 
managed. 
</P>
<P>
Arnie Sagarsky, who left Iceland on May 21 to manage a rink in Nevada, said he 
tripled the Iceland's gross in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Pickwick's Stavert has not commented on the effect of appeals by Nickerson and 
others, or whether he will back keep the promise that Nickerson reported. 
</P>
<P>
But the answer may come today, when representatives of Pickwick management -- 
presumably Stavert, his son Edward and Frank Silvio, Pickwick general manager 
-- meet with Robert R. (Bud) Ovrom, Burbank's city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked for the meeting before I left on vacation," Ovrom said. "The City 
Council and I are very interested in the whole notion of commercial recreation, 
not just the ice rink. That kind of thing -- skating rinks, bowling alleys, 
etc. -- is a vital part of the community mix and it seems to be vanishing." 
</P>
<P>
"The Staverts are definitely having second thoughts," said John Halebian, 
chairman of Save the Ice Committee. "They've had a contractor in to look at the 
roof again -- repairing it would be one of the major expense items." 
</P>
<P>
Gino Vella of Pasadena, vice chairman of the committee, said he, Halebian and 
Margarita Aedo, vice president of the L.A. Figure Skating Club, met with 
Pickwick management Tuesday and he came away with "a very positive feeling 
about keeping the rink open." 
</P>
<P>
The three spoke with Ed Stavert, Silvio and Cary Adams, the rink manager. "They 
said in essence," Vella related, "that it all depends on what happens at the 
meeting today. What that means is they want to see what the city will do for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday the Save the Ice committee held a rally in Burbank that was 
attended by skating stars concerned about Pickwick's fate, including Tiffany 
Chin and Tai Babilonia, as well as by actors Chad Everett, whose daughter 
skates, and Dave Coulier, who plays hockey as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at a statewide board meeting of the California Amateur Hockey Assn., a 
committee was formed to study ways to underwrite development of new rinks. 
Vella, association president, said the committee is a permanent, long-term 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Burgeoning interest in organized skating programs and a succession of rink 
closures in Southern California has resulted in hot competition for ice time. 
In fact, the size of Pickwick's ice area and its seating capacity for 
spectators makes it the only rink left in the northern part of Los Angeles 
County that can play host to qualifying competition for regional and national 
figure skating championships. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to travel a long way to get to anything like it," said Mary Roof, a 
past president of the Los Angeles Figure Skating Club. "We've produced a lot of 
champions at Pickwick. The 'Fabulous Forties,' a revue that skates to the music 
of the 1940s, won national titles three times." 
</P>
<P>
Ice Castle, a facility near Lake Arrowhead in San Bernardino County, can seat 
1,000 for its annual benefit show, but owners Carol and Walter Probst have 
decided their niche is training. The only Southland facility with two ice 
surfaces, Ice Castle has accommodations for serious skaters from all over the 
world who come for extended stays to take advantage of the big-name 
instructors, mile-high altitude and freedom from distractions. 
</P>
<P>
The Probsts built their first rink in the village center at Blue Jay and later 
opened another on the outskirts next to a dormitory and cottages. They also 
acquired a lodge for food service and meetings. Both ice surfaces are 85 by 185 
feet. They are planning a building in which to offer off-ice dance instruction 
for figure skaters. 
</P>
<P>
The head instructor is Robin Cousins, a former Olympic gold medalist from 
Britain. Also on the staff are Irina Rodnina, a Russian pairs skater who won 
three Olympic golds, 10 world championships and 11 European titles, and Frank 
Carroll, three-time U.S. champion who has coached many Olympic contestants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all a labor of love," said Carol Probst, a former Ice Follies star who 
moved to the Arrowhead area to retire. "We haven't turned 
</P>
<P>
a profit yet. We have developed recreational and hockey programs, but I think 
getting into the black will depend on our specialty, advanced instruction for 
figure skaters." 
</P>
<P>
Pickwick has an 85-by-200-foot ice surface and seating for 2,000, making it the 
area's biggest facility next to the Sports Arena. "Hockey participation has 
really grown," Adams said. "In the '70s we had virtually no adult hockey. Now 
we're running 1,500 players through here every week." 
</P>
<P>
Brad Berman, a principal in the California Senior Hockey League, said he had 
400 players three years ago; now there are 800. 
</P>
<P>
"The rinks are making money," he said. "The Pickwick people just aren't 
interested in the skating operation, so they don't want to keep it repaired. 
Our Memorial Day tournament was literally rained out; the roof leaked so bad we 
had to call it off. The owners are more interested in expanding their banquet 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the demand for ice time, rinks have closed in Santa Monica, West 
Covina, Brea, Topanga Plaza, Tarzana and Santa Barbara. There is talk of 
closing the rink at Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood as part of a mall expansion 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Kradin of Forest Development Co. said present plans at the North Hollywood 
mall call for demolishing the one-story structure next to the May Co. to make 
room for a larger structure that would house three anchor stores and have space 
for movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"The skating rink now located in the mall is not included in current plans, but 
we have talked to people concerned about it and are exploring options," she 
said. "We're still working on an environmental impact report, so the mall won't 
come down for years." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors have circulated that even the Culver City Ice Rink is doomed, although 
it is used for practice by the Los Angeles Kings and the building belongs to 
former Kings owner Jerry Buss. The structure sits on leased land, however, 
whose owners are reportedly looking at other uses. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Fox, a former Kings player working in the club's public relations 
department, said that the team is considering a new rink and that it sought his 
opinion on designs a few months ago, but he has heard nothing since. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Moore, the Kings' director of administration, said: "We're not initiating 
anything at present. Some persons have approached us, and we're always open to 
suggestions about new rinks -- we'd love to have as many as possible. We'd 
support hockey in any form; the future of our franchise depends on increasing 
the Southland's understanding of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to open new rinks have been stalled or stymied by a combination of 
factors, including land cost and availability, building costs, zoning and 
homeowner opposition. 
</P>
<P>
All those obstacles seemed to have been hurdled at San Dimas, where a 
redevelopment site was obtained for a rink and office buildings, and the 
objections of neighbors were resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Bea Gallant, who formerly managed the West Covina rink, has agreed to sign a 
30-year lease on the new one, but got so depressed at delays in the project "I 
opened a new business to take my mind off it. I have things for the rink stored 
all over and told people I'd take them back in six months. It's gonna be 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Although ground breaking repeatedly has been postponed, Monrovia developer Fred 
Bowden said: "We're moving ahead slowly. Most small cities send all their stuff 
to the county, and it's in plan check with county planning now. They move at 
their own pace. Financing will be firmed up once we have plans." 
</P>
<P>
Berman is working on a new rink with two others, Larry Bruyere and a silent 
partner, and they have conducted an extensive search for a site. "We're looking 
at one now in the Saugus area," Bruyere said, "in the new city of Santa 
Clarita. There's an existing building that could accommodate a rink without 
much renovation. I think we could be operating there in eight or nine months. 
The owners like our project, and we expect estimates this week from a couple of 
rink builders. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Pickwick doesn't close; I see our rink as a nice networking project 
with theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Even before he heard of the Pickwick closure, Berman had made plans to expand 
the senior hockey league to Nevada. He has already scheduled some major 
tournaments at a new 85-by-200-foot ice surface with seating for 3,000 under 
construction in the Las Vegas area. 
</P>
<P>
Bruyere said the league will include youth hockey for the first time when it 
expands to Nevada and the entire program will be announced at the Sahara in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
The new manager for the Nevada rink -- part of a hotel-casino-recreation 
complex in Painted Desert -- is Sagarsky, formerly of the Iceland in Paramount. 
Contradicting the assertion that ice rinks don't pay, Sagarsky said he tripled 
the gross at Paramount in five years. 
</P>
<P>
"I came there without any experience in ice arenas, but I knew a lot about 
promotion, advertising and positive attitudes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I took over, Paramount opened at 6:30 a.m., closed from 11 to 2 and 
closed for the day at 7:30 p.m. The gross was $300,000 a year. Five years later 
we were open from 5 in the morning until 2 the next morning, with no dark time 
in between. The gross had climbed to almost $1 million." 
</P>
<P>
He attributes the rink's success to aggressive promotion and the elimination of 
negative attitudes among Paramount personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"I only changed 10% of the staff, but I let the rest of them know I didn't want 
to hear another discouraging word," he said. "I set up promotions with the 
schools, got a new director for the skating school, installed a hockey program 
-- even offered free ice time to little kids." 
</P>
<P>
Sagarsky said 50% of the ice time is already sold at the Nevada rink, scheduled 
to open Nov. 1, "and that's the hard part. Selling the rest will be easy. 
There's a substantial figure-skating group here, which used the former rink at 
Henderson (Nev.), but I think hockey will be our bread and butter. I told the 
owners the rink will not run in the red -- ever." 
</P>
<P>
Another group considering a new rink in the western San Fernando Valley is 
headed by Sean McGillivray, who operates the Conejo Valley Ice Skating Center. 
He headed a successful effort to stave off closure of Conejo, but is convinced 
that ice rinks are not money-making enterprises and is attempting to establish 
one on a nonprofit basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to interest a well-known institution in supporting the venture," he 
said. "Rinks often have municipal support in Canada and back East, where they 
recognize the recreational value to the community."

STREET CLOSURES NEAR HOUSING PROJECT URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores has called for the closure of 
several streets and alleys near the Dana Strand housing project in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
In a motion she introduced at a council meeting, Flores said closing the roads 
will enable city officials to erect a security fence around the public housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The fence, she said, would "create a more secure community by helping to reduce 
crime and protecting improvements" to the project. 
</P>
<P>
The fence and other improvements are part of a $14-million face lift to housing 
projects throughout the city, paid for by the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
The action, officials said, is not related to recent gang violence at Dana 
Strand. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been in the works for some time ; we were just waiting for 
engineering reports to be completed," Flores spokeswoman Karen Constine said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores proposal, forwarded by the council to its Public Works Committee, calls 
for closing King Avenue from C to F streets; D Street from Hawaiian Avenue to 
Wilmington Boulevard; E Street from Hawaiian to Wilmington; the alley east of 
Hawaiian from E to C streets, and the alley west of Wilmington from F to C 
streets.

LEGISLATION WOULD HELP WORKERS IN DEFENSE LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress is considering legislation to help defense-industry workers who are 
laid off because of cost-cutting in Congress and the defense industry: 
</P>
<P>
* House Bill 3999, introduced by Rep. Mary Rose Oakar (D-Ohio), would provide 
about $200 million for programs including more unemployment benefits for 
defense workers, educational grants for retraining, and reimbursement money for 
job-search and relocation expenses. The program also sets aside funds for 
entrepreneurs who want to market their defense-industry know-how in the private 
sector. The bill would create an administrative staff, but not a new 
bureaucracy, Oakar said at a public hearing in Paramount on Monday. She said 
the policy-making committee would include the heads of already-existing 
departments, such as the Labor Department, Defense Department and Small 
Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
* House Bill 5327, authored by Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae) and introduced last 
Friday, would return 10% of defense cuts to the communities affected by the 
loss of these federal funds. The secretary of labor would determine which areas 
would be eligible. Cities could use the money for job training or other needed 
programs. Her bill also penalizes contractors that relocate, requiring them to 
leave behind 20% of their contracts' value when they move their facilities and 
leave employees behind. 
</P>
<P>
Boxer has also introduced legislation she said will help communities recover 
from the closing of military bases, which is another aspect of defense 
cutbacks. One bill provides financial incentives to federal employees who 
accept early retirement. Another gives military employees first crack at 
federal jobs when their base is taken over by another agency. A third bill 
mandates 60 days' notice when the government eliminates jobs at a military 
base. 
</P>
<P>
These bills remain in various congressional committees. Oakar's bill, more than 
three years in the making, could be voted on this fall. Boxer's legislation 
faces a more uncertain fate. Tens of thousands of aerospace workers will have 
already lost their jobs by the time any of this proposed legislation would take 
effect.

COLUMBIA WILL SELL JUNK BONDS FOR $3 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE SALE PRICE IS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED, WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR 
TAXPAYERS. BUT THE S&amp;L REMAINS INSOLVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan, the controversial Beverly Hills thrift that was 
built and wrecked by junk bonds, said Wednesday that it agreed to sell its 
entire high-yield portfolio for $3 billion to a Canadian-led investment group. 
</P>
<P>
The sale to Gordon America, a partnership financed principally by the Toronto 
investment firm Gordon Investment Corp. and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 
is the largest single sale of a junk bond portfolio ever. It brought an 
unexpectedly high price that is $68 million more than the $2.9-billion value 
the ailing thrift attaches to the bonds on its books. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts attributed the strong price to the recent recovery in the junk 
bond market as well as to financing arrangements that were offered. Important 
for Columbia is that the sale excludes some rare, valuable securities the 
thrift may yet sell. Some experts believe that these may be worth up to $200 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Even still, few industry executives and analysts expect Columbia to survive as 
an independent institution because of the extensive damage caused by about $1 
billion in losses over the past year. Even with the junk bond sale, Columbia 
will be insolvent and may face further losses on real estate developments. Most 
thrift executives believe a sale of the thrift, either by its current 
management or through a government takeover, is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
What the sale of the junk bonds and the other securities may do, however, is 
minimize the cost of Columbia's problems to taxpayers -- so long as the terms 
of the sale stand up to regulatory scrutiny. Indeed, sources familiar with 
Columbia's financial condition said it could emerge as one of the few large 
troubled savings and loans mopped up by the government with little or no 
taxpayer funds. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators handled Columbia with extraordinary caution, sticking out their 
necks by refraining from seizing it despite its insolvency. Most observers 
believe that the government does not want to add to its holdings of junk bonds 
from troubled thrifts, holdings it values at $3.7 billion. They are probably 
worth much less. 
</P>
<P>
But the sale still faces hurdles, notably approval by various regulators and 
possible scrutiny from members of Congress. Gordon America is making a 
$300-million down payment, financing the rest with a $2.7-billion, 10-year loan 
from Columbia at a 10.5% interest rate. The note is secured by the junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth H. Thomas, a Miami banking and thrift consultant who followed the sale 
closely, believes that the bonds are worth about $2.5 billion today. Despite 
the premium, he said, Columbia is still not ridding itself of the bonds' risk 
because it is financing the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not 'direct junk' anymore. It's 'indirect junk,' " Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Chief Executive Edward G. Harshfield acknowledged in an interview 
Wednesday that Columbia will carry some risk, but said that is preferable to no 
sale at all. 
</P>
<P>
"The alternative for Columbia and taxpayers is to carry all of the risk instead 
of carrying the risk less $300 million," Harshfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia is believed to have persuaded some bond rating agencies to consider 
the note "investment grade" because the risk is spread among so many junk 
bonds. That would mean it would be considered less risky, which might make the 
sale more acceptable to regulators and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Columbia and its investment bankers will likely argue that Gordon 
America is well financed. Among its participants are the Kuwait Investment 
Office, the London-based investment arm of the Kuwaiti government; Hollinger 
Inc., a Canadian newspaper firm that owns London's Daily Telegraph; Canada Life 
Assurance Co.; General Electric Capital, the finance arm of General Electric 
Co.; Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and Japan's Yasuda Trust &amp; 
Banking Co. In addition, Gordon America has an incentive to pay off the loan 
early: It must pay a $5-million annual fee over 10 years as long as the loan is 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds are securities issued by companies with relatively poor credit 
ratings, rewarding investors with exceptionally high yields for their risk. 
Under former Chief Executive Thomas Spiegel, Columbia used much of its 
taxpayer-insured deposits through the 1980s to plunge into junk bonds largely 
sold through the Beverly Hills office of former Drexel Burnham Lambert 
financier Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia was the biggest buyer of junk bonds among the nation's thrifts, and 
made spectacular profits while the market was healthy. But junk bonds plunged 
in value over the past year because of concerns about the economy, the 
financial condition of some issuers and the demise of Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
The sale, which concluded at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday in a New York law office, 
involved some 300 bonds and related securities issued by about 200 companies. A 
staggering amount of time was spent on the deal, with one participant 
estimating that 300 representatives of bidders, investment bankers, lawyers and 
others were involved. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 parties expressed interest to Columbia's investment banker, First 
Boston, with 30 considering a bid seriously. Eight pre-selected parties 
ultimately submitted bids on July 16, ranging from $2.2 billion to $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said losing bids came from the Tisch family's Loews Corp.; the Pritzker 
family of Chicago; the New York banking firm Bankers Trust; the Los Angeles 
financial services firm Broad Inc.; financier Carl C. Icahn; the New York 
investment firm Lancer Group, and a group made up of the investment firm 
Odyssey Partners, banking giant Citicorp and the Wall Street firm Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel, whose family still controls Columbia, could not be reached for 
comment. He has supported selling the bonds in the past, although his 
relationship with Columbia's current management is strained. In any event, 
observers said, any resistance to the sale could be overcome by a takeover by 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Another sticky issue could be raised by losing bidders. The government hired 
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., a unit of General Electric Co., to evaluate the 
transaction. General Electric Capital, another arm of General Electric, holds 
about a 3% stake in Gordon Investment Corp., which led the successful bid. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Gordon group, who did not return phone calls, were said to be 
concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest. But officials from 
the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, who must approve the transaction, 
said they do not see a conflict because General Electric Capital is a small, 
indirect investor in the junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Wednesday was the deadline for Spiegel to answer charges brought 
against him by the OTS this month alleging that he squandered $19 million of 
Columbia's assets on such items as corporate jets, condominiums and guns. The 
government is seeking $24 million from Spiegel, who has vowed to fight the 
charges. The initial response was not expected to go into much detail on why he 
denies the charges.

REPORT CARD SHOWS WIDE GAP BETWEEN BEST, WORST S&amp;LS

The nation's beleaguered savings and loan industry is becoming more sharply 
divided, with the healthy institutions now earning steady profits while "the 
bad ones are getting worse," the nation's top thrift regulator said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,514 independent savings and loan associations suffered an overall loss of 
$271 million during the first quarter, but performance varied widely among 
different segments of the industry, according to figures issued by the Office 
of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"We see at least some positive results, but this is still a very tough 
situation," Timothy Ryan, OTS director, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's figures showed that the well-capitalized and healthy S&amp;Ls made 
profits of about $700 million, and another group -- sound but not quite as 
strong financially -- earned about $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
But these profits were far overshadowed by the deep deficit of about $1.2 
billion at two groups of dangerously weak thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of these badly ailing institutions is expected to play a major role in 
determining the ultimate cost of the S&amp;L bailout, the biggest financial 
rescue in history. 
</P>
<P>
The government is slated to spend an estimated $300 billion or more over the 
next 30 years to finance the closing of hundreds of insolvent thrifts and to 
pay off depositors. Currently, federal insurance covers the first $100,000 of 
each account. 
</P>
<P>
The government already has seized nearly 500 institutions and will report 
separately on how they are faring under federal control. Regulators say they 
may be forced to seize between 350 and 700 of the thrifts still in private 
hands, depending on the health of these institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan offered a mixed financial portrait of the S&amp;Ls that are still in the 
private sector, underscoring a wide disparity between the sick and the healthy 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
"We see at least some positive results in identifying insolvent institutions 
and putting them out of business," he said. The OTS identifies the institutions 
that are about to fail, and the Resolution Trust Corp. places them under 
government control. 
</P>
<P>
The report showed that 1,264 institutions that the agency placed in the 
category of healthiest thrifts contained $404 billion in assets, about 38% of 
the total held by all the independent thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
According to the regulators, all these institutions have adequate capital and 
are well managed. This group also has been a consistent moneymaker, despite the 
recent softening in the general economy and the downturn in the real estate 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
These healthy institutions had profits of about $700 million in the first 
quarter, the same as they earned in the first quarter of 1989. The S&amp;Ls in 
this category have "long-term viability, and they earn an adequate return," 
said Bert Ely, an independent consultant. 
</P>
<P>
A second group, made up of thrifts that are profitable but fall short of the 
government's new, stricter capital requirements, had much lower earnings -- 
about $200 million in the first quarter, down from about $300 million a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The second group includes 620 S&amp;Ls with $326 billion in assets, or about 
30% of the industry total. 
</P>
<P>
Although the S&amp;Ls in this group were technically profitable, Ely and some 
other analysts are much less sanguine about them. 
</P>
<P>
These thrifts "may be survivors in the regulatory sense, but they won't make it 
in the marketplace," Ely predicted. This second category of thrifts posted an 
anemic 6% to 7% return on equity, compared to 11% or 12% for the first group, 
Ely said. 
</P>
<P>
The most severely wounded casualties, many of which seem likely to end up under 
government control, are split between groups three and four. 
</P>
<P>
Those cited in group four -- 319 in all -- generally have posted massive losses 
and have already been identified by federal regulators. The thrifts in this 
group lost about $900 million in the first quarter, far worse than the 
$100-million deficit in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
These thrifts have cumulative assets of $195 billion, accounting for about 18% 
of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The potential nightmare for Ryan and other federal regulators comes from the 
prospect of widespread failure among the 311 S&amp;Ls in group three. They 
suffered losses of about $300 million in the first quarter of this year, after 
breaking even in the first quarter of 1989. This group has assets of $149 
billion, or 14% of the industry's total holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Most S&amp;Ls in group three are operating under strict plans approved by the 
federal government to raise additional capital, and they generally restrict 
their lending activity until federal regulators say they are satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"We are watching these very closely," Ryan said. "I am watching them personally 
on a monthly basis." 
</P>
<P>
For the two weakest categories of thrifts, "you can see the numbers. . . get 
worse," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said the ultimate fate of many of the thrifts will depend on the real 
estate market, "over which we have no control." If billions of dollars in real 
estate loans go bad because houses, office buildings and shopping centers 
cannot be sold or leased at a profitable price, the lending institutions may be 
dragged down.

Wilma! It's time to hit the malls. 
</P>
<P>
Hanna-Barbera Productions, the storied animation house that gave the world the 
Flintstones and the Jetsons, said Wednesday that it will open a store at the 
Westside Pavilion in West Los Angeles Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Another shop is scheduled to open at the Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance on 
Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The stores will carry clothing, stuffed dolls, toys, games, jewelry and 
collectibles. Hanna-Barbera's first retail outlet began business last month at 
the new Universal Studios Florida tour in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp-eyed shoppers will notice that the firm isn't the first show-biz legend 
to go into retailing. It's following the path of Walt Disney Co., which sells 
the likes of Minnie and Mickey at its 50 mall stores.

MERCK, DU PONT TO FORM VENTURE TO PRODUCE DRUGS; 
</P>
<P>
PHARMACEUTICALS: THE DEAL IS SEEN AS A CREATIVE SOLUTION TO THE INDUSTRY'S 
VORACIOUS APPETITE FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDS. 
</P>

<P>
Merck &amp; Co. and Du Pont said Wednesday that they agreed to form a joint 
venture to create an independent, research-driven pharmaceuticals company that 
would operate worldwide with sales of about $700 million in its first year. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont, the giant Wilmington, Del.-based industrial company with interest in 
chemicals, plastics and fibers, will contribute its entire pharmaceutical and 
imaging agents business to the joint venture. Rahway, N.J.-based Merck, the 
world's largest pharmaceuticals company, said it will provide its research and 
development and international marketing expertise to the venture. It will also 
provide cash and marketing rights to several prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture -- to be called Du Pont o Merck Pharmaceuticals Co. -- will 
be a substantial new player in the pharmaceuticals business with a research 
staff of about 1,500 people and a first-year research budget of about $230 
million, increasing to about $400 million in 1995. Analysts said the joint 
venture is a creative solution to the pharmaceutical industry's voracious 
appetite for research and development dollars and the needs of individual 
companies to fill gaps in marketing and research expertise. 
</P>
<P>
For Du Pont, the joint venture also gets it out of the day-to-day management of 
a business it has "invested heavily in with limited success," said Viren Mehta 
of the New York-based pharmaceuticals research firm of Mehta &amp; Isaly. 
</P>
<P>
Merck Senior Vice President Francis Spiegel said the company, a unit of 
Swiss-based Merck AG, has deliberately avoided the "megamergers" that have 
occurred with frequency in the industry in recent years as companies sought 
more marketing and research dollars to keep up with the rising cost and 
difficulties of bringing new drugs to market. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our competitors went for mergers and what we found is that when they 
did, they had to go at a premium over the market price. . . . We didn't want to 
go that route," Spiegel said in an interview. Merck preferred to pick "good 
partners" in joint ventures to fill its needs, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Merck's size, it still has only about 5% of the world market, he said. 
It is the industry leader in research spending, with more than $850 million 
budgeted in 1990, but that is still less than 5% of the world's research 
dollars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided if we want to be a premium growth company, we needed more research 
effort. We need alliances," Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
Merck Chairman and Chief Executive P. Roy Vagelos said the company's research 
budget and research staff of 4,500 are substantial. "But we believe even more 
is needed for us to do the important research that needs to be done. The way to 
success in this high-risk business is to invest more in research and to invest 
it wisely," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont Chairman and Chief Executive Edgar S. Woolard Jr. said the joint 
venture gives Du Pont "the opportunity to realize more quickly its vision of 
being a major player in the pharmaceuticals industry by bringing together two 
well respected health-care companies." 
</P>
<P>
The companies said the joint venture's first priority will be to build its 
European business base by adding some current Merck drugs and by increasing its 
European sales force to at least 650 people in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Merck will contribute to the joint venture certain marketing rights in five 
European countries to the anti-Parkinson disease medicine Sinemet and to the 
cardiovascular medicine Moduretic. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Mehta pointed out that those products are a small part of Merck and are 
primarily older drugs whose patents will soon expire. Putting the marketing of 
these older products in the joint venture "frees up the sales force to do more 
important things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will also market -- upon receipt of regulatory approval -- in 
those countries a brand of a compound Merck is currently testing to reduce 
enlarged prostate glands. Merck will retain marketing rights to Proscar, 
another brand of the prostate medicine. All of Du Pont's prescription drugs on 
the market will be part of the joint venture, including the anti-clotting agent 
Coumadin and the analgesics Percodan and Percocet. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said they don't expect the research efforts of the joint venture 
to produce significant commercial results until the late 1990s. "This is a 
long-term deal," Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the joint venture grew out of a separate cross-marketing and 
research and development deal the companies entered into last October, Spiegel 
said.

INDICTMENT OF EASTERN CLAIMS BOGUS RECORDS; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE CARRIER ALLEGEDLY SHOWED MAINTENANCE WORK THAT HADN'T BEEN DONE. 
ITEMS SUCH AS LANDING GEAR WERE INVOLVED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury indicted Eastern Airlines and 10 current and former 
employees Wednesday for allegedly failing to perform mandatory maintenance on 
airliners and for falsifying maintenance records to make it appear that the 
work had been done. 
</P>
<P>
In a 60-count indictment, the government said the troubled airline's motivation 
was "to avoid costly flight delays and cancellations." 
</P>
<P>
The indictments were announced by Andrew J. Maloney, U.S. attorney for the 
Eastern District of New York, who said at a news conference here that "we hope 
to send a clear message, not just to Eastern but to the entire airline 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Maloney said that the allegedly illegal actions were directed out of the 
airline's Miami headquarters and that they involved "critical items," including 
radar, landing gear, automatic pilot instruments and fuel systems. 
</P>
<P>
Though the already bankrupt airline faces a fine of as much as $30 million, 
Maloney said "this case is not about fines. This case is about deterrence." 
Each person indicted faces a prison term of up to five years and a $250,000 
fine on each account. 
</P>
<P>
The highest-ranking defendant is Edward Upton, Eastern's former staff vice 
president of maintenance and engineering who has left the company. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged violations, which were said to have occurred from July, 1985, 
through October, 1989, took place at New York's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia 
airports and at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Martin R. Shugrue Jr., the trustee who was appointed by a bankruptcy judge in 
April to run Eastern, said Tuesday that the indictments were imminent. But he 
said the violations had all occurred before Eastern's employees went on strike 
in March, 1989. The carrier filed for bankruptcy law protection from creditors 
a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
Maloney said Wednesday that his office was made aware of the violations by an 
Eastern supervisor who reported them "voluntarily" about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The government prosecutor said no maintenance violations took place at Eastern 
after the strike began but that there had been "obstruction of justice" until 
last October. He said no evidence of impropriety had been discovered since 
Shugrue took control of Eastern three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment said: "As a result of unreasonable demands, pressure and 
intimidation put on them by Eastern's upper management to keep aircraft in 
flight at all costs, maintenance personnel failed to perform maintenance work 
on the aircraft which, if performed, would have delayed the aircraft. The 
defendants then doctored the log books, work cards and computer entries to 
indicate falsely that the work had been accomplished." In a statement issued 
Wednesday, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said: "The alleged conspiracy relating to 
the falsification of maintenance and safety records strikes a raw nerve in 
anyone who has ever boarded an airplane. Thousands of innocent passengers may 
have been put at risk every day by the criminal actions of these defendants." 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleged that defendants falsely signed maintenance records for 
work that had not, in fact, been done; that they forged other employees' names 
and signed fictitious names and entered false employee numbers on records 
fraudulently indicating maintenance had been performed; that they induced other 
employees to verify that work had been done when it had not, and that they 
falsely entered worker completion codes in Eastern's computer -- authorizing 
the aircraft for flight -- without doing the work or completing required log 
books or work cards. 
</P>
<P>
Maloney said faulty cockpit gauges were replaced by backup gauges and that 
frequently the faulty gauges became the backups -- without the knowledge of 
pilots. He said "sumping," a very important operation required in aircraft 
maintenance was often not performed. 
</P>
<P>
Sumping involves removing water that has accumulated in a plane's fuel tanks. 
With water in the tanks, pilots might not know how much fuel they had left. 
Also, the water could freeze during flight, possibly blocking fuel lines. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Upton, the other defendants named in the indictment were Thomas Lewis, 
who was Eastern's northern area director of maintenance, Joseph Moser, former 
maintenance manager at JFK, and the following foremen or other management 
employees: Elia Dragone, Charles E. Catarelli, Jacques Jean, Roy Hardy, Robert 
Knox and Stephen Jones. 
</P>
<P>
One other defendant -- not listed in the indictment -- was identified by 
prosecutors as Michael Hennessey, a general foreman. Maloney said Hennessey 
would be named in a separate indictment, but gave no explanation for the 
separation. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants will appear for arraignment next week, Maloney said. None of 
them could be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
An Eastern spokeswoman said Dragone and Upton were no longer with the company 
and that all of the others had earlier been assigned to non-maintenance 
positions. On Wednesday, they were put on administrative leave with pay. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration came to the defense of the present 
management of the airline Wednesday but warned that it will keep a close watch 
on its maintenance activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern Airlines today meets the FAA's safety standards," FAA Administrator 
James B. Busey said in a statement released by the agency. "Nevertheless, we 
are carefully studying the indictment issued today, and if we find anything 
that gives us concern for safety we will take whatever action is necessary to 
protect the traveling public."

Chrysler to Consolidate Jeep Production: The nation's No. 3 auto maker said it 
will consolidate North American production of its Jeep at its Toledo, Ohio, 
assembly plant, closing another plant in Brampton, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
It said the move to consolidate Jeep production is part of a tentative 
agreement reached with the city of Toledo and the state of Ohio. Details of the 
agreement were not announced, and the pact is subject to final approval by the 
city and state, Chrysler said. Under the plan, North American Jeep production 
would be consolidated beginning in the summer of 1992.

DE BEERS SIGNS DIAMOND DEAL WITH SOVIETS

<P>
De Beers tightened its grip on the global diamond market Wednesday with an 
exclusive five-year deal to sell the Soviet Union's rough diamond output, which 
could total more than $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The financially strained Soviet Union, among the world's biggest gem diamond 
producers, will get a $1-billion advance against future diamond sales. 
</P>
<P>
De Beers' London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, will 
strengthen its position as the world's dominant diamond seller. It already 
markets 80% of global rough diamond production of some 100 million carats. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets do not disclose their output. 
</P>
<P>
The nation reached the deal because it wanted to sell a huge stockpile of 
diamonds without disrupting the stable world diamond market, De Beers said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union had refused to deal directly with the South African-based 
company because of its home country's policies of racial separation, but now is 
willing to do business openly with De Beers' new Swiss arm, De Beers Centenary 
AG. 
</P>
<P>
De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. established the publicly held Swiss company in 
May to head the non-South African businesses of De Beers, which is controlled 
by the wealthy Oppenheimer family of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
De Beers Centenary said in a statement released in Lucerne, Switzerland, and 
made available in London that it reached the agreement with Glavalmazzoloto of 
the Soviet Union for the exclusive export and sale of the U.S.S.R. diamond 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Glavalmazzoloto is the main administration for precious metals and diamonds 
under the Soviet Union's council of ministers, De Beers said. 
</P>
<P>
De Beers' Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Centenary Holdings SA, has agreed to 
advance Glavalmazzoloto $1 billion against future diamond deliveries. Repayment 
would be made over five years beginning in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet diamond stockpile will be held at De Beers' marketing arm as 
collateral for the advance, De Beers said.

PACTEL, CELLULAR AGREE TO MERGER OF SOME INTERESTS

<P>
Pacific Telesis Group and Cellular Communications Inc. said Wednesday that they 
would merge their cellular telephone interests in Ohio and Michigan in a move 
that ultimately will further consolidate the growing industry. 
</P>
<P>
The deal calls for San Francisco-based PacTel to invest at least $87 million 
for an immediate 5% stake in Cellular Communications. Within the next six 
years, PacTel could take over Cellular Communications entirely for another $600 
million or more. 
</P>
<P>
The merger is the latest in a series of recent moves by telecommunications 
companies to strengthen their cellular operations throughout the world. They 
are seeking to take advantage of huge projected growth in radio wave telephone 
services fueled by new technology, improved transmission devices and declining 
equipment prices.

THE NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: MUFFINS, GOOD COFFEE -- THEY MAKE RISING EARLY WORTH

The specially blended yogurt at Chelsea's Choice keeps the customers coming 
during the day, especially in the summer. But early mornings, the place belongs 
strictly to the muffin crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those who stop by come for takeout on the way to work. When you've got 
a few minutes to spare, though, Chelsea's is a cheerful place to sit awhile 
with a good cup of coffee and a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, a tasty muffin. There are raspberry and blueberry bran, banana 
walnut, banana oatmeal, oat bran, chocolate chip, carrot nut bran, but the best 
is carrot -- moist, not-too-sweet, with lots of walnuts and perfect spicing. 
</P>
<P>
You also can find novel varieties. On a recent morning, for instance, there 
were "turtles" (made with pecans, caramel and chocolate) and hot fudge muffins 
(with the real stuff, as well as chocolate chips and sour cream). If that's not 
enough, there's a sweet streusel version of some sort each day; blueberry, 
apple and cinnamon are among the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Chelsea's is worth getting up early for. No day that starts there can be all 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Chelsea's Choice, 777 S. Main St. 125, Santa Ana. Open Mondays through Fridays 
6:15 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturdays from 7:15 a.m. to 5 p.m. (714) 972-9171. 3025 E. 
Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. Open daily 6:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., Sundays from 7 
a.m.. (714) 675-7870.

King Neptune's Seafood Restaurant and NNNautical Museum, 17115 Pacific Coast 
Highway, Sunset Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Open daily 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Dinners are served after 5. (213) 592-4878. 
Started as a place for the ex-Marine owner to display his huge collection of 
nautical/military artifacts, this bar-restaurant-museum is one of the least 
pretentious, and most bizarre, places in Orange County or maybe anywhere. Basic 
seafood, like the ambience, comes in generous portions. KENT ZELAS

MAX JACOBSON: SOUTH ITALIAN FARE, SOUTH PHILLY FLAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yo! You from the neighborhood, or what? 
</P>
<P>
The newly opened Rumari -- literally, "restaurant by the sea" in Sicilian -- 
brings South Philly a little closer to our shores. Not quite on them -- the 
restaurant is in Laguna Beach, but on the windward side of South Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
So it's not actually on the shore. Fuhgeddaboudit. 
</P>
<P>
When I say South Philly, I think of southern Italian cooking in a setting that 
is friendly to the point of distraction. Rumari feels like a neighborhood 
restaurant -- people crowd around the bar like old friends and there's loud, 
animated talking in every direction. Most of the waiters sound like Sylvester 
Stallone between rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of Rumari -- Bina and Antonio Crivello and their five sons -- have 
done this before. When we last saw them they were helping locals paint the town 
red at Ciao, their high-spirited Philly-style trattoria in Santa Ana. Ciao is 
an inexpensive place where you eat wonderful pizzas from ceramic platters and 
drink beer by the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
But with Rumari, the Crivellos have moved radically upscale. The new place has 
beige walls and subdued lighting. The waiters wear tuxedos, wine glasses are 
crowned with linens, antipasto is dished up with a flourish from a 
marble-topped table. The menu is full of designer pastas and sophisticated 
grills. 
</P>
<P>
It's nice to see how comfortably they have made the transition, but I do wish 
they'd brought a little more of Ciao to Rumari, particularly more of those 
terrific pizzas. There are only two at Rumari, pizzetta ai frutti di mare, 
topped with smoked salmon, shrimp and clams, and pizzetta vegetariana, with 
vegetables and mozzarella. And I wish they wouldn't call them pizzette, because 
they are gigantic. 
</P>
<P>
The seafood pizza is just great, by the way, even though the crust gets a 
little soggy. There's just the right hint of tomato sauce and the topping -- 
smoky salmon, salty clams and sweet, oversized shrimp -- has the perfect 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping things in perfect proportion can be a task in this restaurant, though. 
The Crivellos are an expansive family, and if they can't smother you with 
affection, they'll smother you with food. Order with moderation . . . and plan 
to take home leftovers anyway. 
</P>
<P>
As at many Italian restaurants, the appetizers and pastas seem to be the stars. 
The antipasto misto is a huge platter of stuffed eggplant, thick-sliced Genoa 
salami, razor-thin prosciutto, soppressata salami, fire-roasted sweet peppers 
and marinated mushrooms and artichokes. With oil-rubbed focaccia bread, you 
could make a meal of it all by itself. 
</P>
<P>
Trio misto, from the hot appetizer section, is another killer. It's a platter 
of garlicky sauteed prawns, baked clams with bread crumb stuffing and a heady 
slab of mozzarella marinara, breaded and fried and topped with a thick tomato 
sauce. Finish either of these two dishes by yourself and chances are you'll be 
through for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
The lighter starters sound more sensible but often don't taste as good. The 
salmon carpaccio is decent but needlessly cluttered with fresh mushrooms and 
sun-dried tomatoes. The tomatoes, in particular, just don't mingle with the 
fish. In the veal carpaccio, on the other hand, all you can taste is 
overpowering hunks of imported Parmesan. The salads, such as pomodori e cipolla 
(fresh tomato and onion in an olive oil vinaigrette), are fine but not 
distinctive. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen has a tendency to overcook the pasta, so if you like yours al 
dente, put in a word with the waiter. What distinguishes the pastas here are 
some really good sauces. The handmade gnocchi -- exquisite soft potato 
dumplings -- come in a muscular Gorgonzola sauce that hits your nose like a 
left jab. Fettuccine con panna e ricotta is just the opposite, noodles that 
slide into your mouth like silk, in a delicate cream sauce so light it almost 
floats. 
</P>
<P>
Bucatini al ragu con polpettini di vitello is like extra-thick spaghetti in 
meat sauce with the addition of delightful meatballs made from ground veal. I 
couldn't get enough of the meatballs, but the starchiness of the pasta left me 
cold. Angel hair, called vermicelli picchio pacchio on this menu, is served in 
a sauce of fresh and dried tomato, basil, garlic, olive oil and Parmesan. It's 
probably the most versatile dish on the menu -- it could go nicely with almost 
any main course. 
</P>
<P>
In good Italian restaurants, it is easy to run out of steam by the time the 
main courses are served. Rumari has a good selection, so pace yourself. Pesce 
spada is swordfish adroitly grilled with onions and capers. Lombata di vitello 
is a veal chop braised in rich wine sauce and dotted with rosemary. Best of all 
is bistecca all' arrabiata, a New York steak in a spicy onion, red pepper and 
white wine sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The Crivellos did bring one dessert over from Ciao, an excellent tiramisu. This 
one positively drools rich mascarpone cheese and has a crust of almond-flavored 
amaretto cookies in place of the traditional ladyfingers. The semifreddo is 
even harder to resist. It's white chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce and 
espresso poured onto it table-side, then finished with a topping of crushed 
amaretti. 
</P>
<P>
Bet you're thinking you'll be too full. Hey, fuhgeddaboudit. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumari is moderately expensive. Appetizers are $6 to $10. Soups and salads are 
$4 to $8. Pastas are $9 to $13. Main dishes are $13 to $20.

NEWSBITES: A NEW RIB TRADER: FUN IN THE JUNGLE

More new restaurants: 
</P>
<P>
* Dana Point obviously was ready for a Rib Trader. The restaurant, first 
offshoot of the original in San Clemente, opened recently to capacity crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Don Long, who has owned restaurants in Los Angeles, executed a complete redo of 
the former Capers, and it's a jungle in there, complete with exotic plants and 
replicas of rhinos and such. The specialty, of course, is barbecue, featuring 
Midwest cornfed beef, but there's more, including fresh abalone daily. The 
average dinner price is $11, and it's fun, casual; no reservations. Mondays 
through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sundays from 4:30 to 11 p.m. at 
34150 Pacific Coast Highway. (714) 661-0119. 
</P>
<P>
* The Athenian, at 5874 Edinger Ave. in Huntington Beach's Marina Village 
Center, recently began serving 50 Greek specialties from chicken stuffed with 
spinach, onions and feta cheese to lamb dishes, stuffed grape leaves and gyros. 
Chef Aristidis D. Deslis used to be with Greek Cuisine of Tustin. Lunch, 
Mondays through Fridays: $4.95 to $15.95. Dinner nightly: $7.95 to 8.95. (714) 
840-6518. 
</P>
<P>
* Mezzaluna is the new Italian kid on the block, having taken the old 
Hemingway's location at 2441 E. Coast Highway in Corona del Mar. There are sky 
and cloud scenes on the ceilings and almost a hundred paintings and art works 
on the walls. And there are homemade pizzas and pastas, salads and antipasti at 
prices ranging from $5.50 to $13. Lunches Monday through Friday, dinner nighly 
from 5 to midnight, and on Saturdays it's open all day starting at 11:30 a.m.

AMERICAN * Be-Bop Burgers, 18575 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 842-1958. 
Open daily from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; weekends to midnight. Carhop service 
Wednesdays through the weekend from 7 p.m. to closing. $ 
</P>
<P>
* Pinky's Hamburger Grill, 4115 Campus Drive, Irvine. (714) 854-4632. Open 
Sundays through Thursdays from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 
11 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
 Be-Bop Burgers and Pinky's Hamburger Grill are part of a wave of "nostalgia" 
hamburger joints engulfing Orange County, and both are longer on atmosphere 
than food. The Be-Bop burger is a good value, a full quarter pound of lean beef 
on a seeded bun that just drips with condiments. Pinky's beach burgers are 
charcoal-grilled and really taste good. Other sandwiches in both restaurants 
are less appealing. Luckily, both restaurants exude energy, plus the mindless 
fun of the '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHINESE 
</P>
<P>
* Five Feet Too, in Fashion Island, 1145 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. 
(714) 640-5250. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to midnight. $$ 
</P>
<P>
The gentrification of Chinese cuisine reaches new heights of absurdity in this 
self-consciously chic restaurant, the second effort of owner-chef Michael Kang. 
The restaurant is visually stunning but often comes up short in the taste 
department: Many dishes are precious and ill-conceived. The signature 
deep-fried catfish is excellent, and some imaginative dishes work well. 
Curried-beef spring rolls are delightful. Kung pao three, with chicken, 
scallops and shrimp, is too. Desserts also are fine. Pity they don't serve 
humble pie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GREEK 
</P>
<P>
* Mene's Terrace, Orange Tree Plaza, 23532 El Toro Road, El Toro. (714) 
830-3228. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 5 to 
9:30 p.m.; Saturdays from 5 to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Mene's Terrace is like a sun-splashed Aegean taverna transported magically to 
an El Toro shopping mall. You know you're not in Greece because you can see the 
Denny's just outside the window. The menu is small, but everything is prepared 
the way an Orthodox grandmother would prepare it. Tirapita and spanakopita 
(little cheese and spinach pies in a filo crust) are near perfect. The egg 
lemon soup is even better. Wonderful char-grilled meats, marinated in lemon 
juice and Greek spices, are served with rice pilaf and pan-roasted potatoes. 
There is even complimentary baklava at dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INDIAN 
</P>
<P>
* Royal Khyber, 1000 N. Bristol St., Newport Beach. (714) 752-5200. Open 
Sundays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and daily from 5:30 to 
10:30 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
The cuisine at Royal Khyber is the rich Mughlai type from northern India, and 
the restaurant has a richness to match; it resembles a maharaja's palace. The 
best time to visit is for Sunday brunch, when a tempting array of more than 20 
dishes is spread out before you. Meats cooked in the 800-degree tandoor are 
tender and crumbly with exotic spices. Biryani (a simple basmati rice dish with 
peas and fried onions) is soft and fragrant. Among the many other dishes, 
chicken curry, channa masala (stewed garbanzo beans) and the dessert, a 
carrot-almond pudding, are most memorable.

FOR SALE BY OWNER: David A. Brown, convicted of murdering one wife and plotting 
to kill another, now is offering to sell his story for $200. . . . Why so 
cheap? Because he needs cash fast to move his "lady friend" into an apartment 
near County Jail for more convenient visits, Brown explains. . . . It would be 
a temporary arrangement. He'll be transferred to a state prison sometime in the 
next few months. Ted Johnson and Vince Sweeney

<P>
For seven years, Shirley Adams has been bringing her daughter, Tiffany, to the 
Buena Park Boys Club where the 17-year-old is a member of the wheelchair hockey 
team. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, the Adamses weren't there for recreation. They were there to 
lead a demonstration by more than 120 parents and youngsters who were angry 
because the man who supervised the wheelchair hockey team had been forced out 
of his job. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Eastland, the club's program director and a 30-year employee of the 
facility, was told this month that his position had been eliminated because of 
a budget crunch. 
</P>
<P>
"The community is greatly affected by losing Bob," Shirley Adams said. "We 
can't let that happen." 
</P>
<P>
Club officials say that Eastland's position was eliminated as part of a 
reorganization, emphasizing that he was not fired. President John Leland said 
the club has been on shaky financial footing for the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Eastland's job may be split into two lower-paying positions which he can apply 
for, said Erik Larson, executive director of the club. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that the reorganization has to affect someone," Larson said. 
"We feel bad, but we have to pay the bills." 
</P>
<P>
However, Eastland, who watched Wednesday's protest outside the Knott Avenue 
club, disagrees with that description. "I was shocked," said Eastland, who 
started working for the club as a janitor about 30 years ago. "(Leland's) term 
is reorganization. What would you call it?" 
</P>
<P>
Eastland, whose job as program director lasts through August, watched the 
demonstration and afterward helped pick up some litter left behind by the 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of embarrassing, but it makes you proud," Eastland said of the 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
Eastland said he has not decided whether to apply for one of the lower-paying 
positions. Eastland and club officials declined to disclose his salary. 
</P>
<P>
Parents say Eastland has been instrumental in starting many of the club's 
athletic programs, including those tailored for the physically handicapped. 
Several of Eastland's programs have won awards from both local and national 
athletic associations. 
</P>
<P>
"We know if he leaves, the program won't continue," said Richard Derylder, 21, 
a member of the wheelchair hockey club. 
</P>
<P>
Club officials say the reorganization will not result in the elimination of any 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's protest drew both former and current members of the club who had 
worked with Eastland. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to always tell me to stay in school and get an education. And I did," 
said Teresa Uresti, 27, who worked at the club about 13 years ago. "A lot of 
these kids think he is a hero." 
</P>
<P>
Many youngsters said Eastland was the reason they went to the club. "If Bob 
leaves we probably won't come back," Sheena Moore, 7, said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Barbara Ermis, 11: "We are trying to keep Bob. He is nice to us. He has a 
really nice personality." 
</P>
<P>
After the protest, Leland met with a group of parents for about an hour to 
discuss the situation, but there was no change in the club's position. More 
than half of the club's $350,000 annual budget comes from donations, and in the 
last few years, "the donations seemed to dry up," Leland said. 
</P>
<P>
Financial problems are also forcing the club for the first time to charge 
youngsters an admission fee of $1 a day, he noted.

Diana DeArmond and her husband have been cleared but their family's life is 
still suffering in the wake of their arrest by La Habra police last week on 
suspicion of felony child endangerment after their 18-month-old daughter, 
Elizabeth, nearly drowned in a bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
Although the DeArmonds have been cleared by the Orange County district 
attorney's office, the 22-year-old mother said her husband, Jimmy, 26, has lost 
his job as a roofer because of the arrest. She said she also suffers nightmares 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been bad enough dealing with the accident," Diana DeArmond said in an 
interview Wednesday. "I thought she was dead. They (police) treated me like a 
common criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested the DeArmonds on July 18 after Diana DeArmond had found 
Elizabeth floating face down in bath water about 7:30 p.m. The girl had been 
taking a bath with her 2 1/2-year-old sister, Heather. After police were 
called, Elizabeth was taken to Brea Community Hospital and then to Children's 
Hospital of Orange County, where she initially was listed in critical 
condition. Heather was taken from her parents and placed under protective 
custody at Orangewood Children's Home in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
After their arrest, the DeArmonds were taken to County Jail. They were released 
the next day. The two girls were also released to their parents' custody 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Nat Glover said the incident was an "unfortunate accident." 
</P>
<P>
Glover said the district attorney's office decided Tuesday the facts of the 
incident did not support criminal prosecution of the couple. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra Police Lt. Terry Rammell said that statements made by the DeArmonds 
and the condition of the younger child prompted Officer Chris Koelber to arrest 
the couple. 
</P>
<P>
"The arresting officer acted appropriately under the circumstances," Rammell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rammell said Diana DeArmond had told Koelber that she had left the children 
unattended for several minutes. But she says the girls had been in the tub for 
10 minutes and that she had left the bathroom only to get diapers, towels and 
their pajamas in the next room. 
</P>
<P>
"The police tried to make it seem like I made them (the girls) take a bath to 
get rid of them," DeArmond said. "I did not leave my kids unattended." 
</P>
<P>
DeArmond says she and her family are now trying to recover from the incident. 
The family will attend crisis counseling provided by the County Social Services 
Agency, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was away from my kids for two nights and I couldn't sleep without them," 
DeArmond said. "I'm happy this is all over."

SUPERVISORS TOLD CUTS WILL GIVE CRIME A BIG EDGE 
</P>

Proposed cuts in the Orange County budget for the 1990-91 fiscal year would put 
more criminals on the streets with depleted sheriff's patrols to pursue them 
and fewer prosecutors to send them to jail, county officials warned the Board 
of Supervisors in a bleak session Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
That was only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Jail overcrowding, already a serious problem in the county, would probably 
increase, as would police response times, officials said. Other cuts would 
threaten county services for abused women and children, leave mentally ill 
people at risk and strip medically indigent patients of badly needed health 
care services, according to testimony from more than a dozen officials and 
community activists. 
</P>
<P>
And though officials are trying to avoid laying off any of the county's 16,000 
employees by shifting workers around instead of firing them, some workers may 
ultimately lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing one dire prediction after another, Board Chairman Don R. Roth looked up 
from behind his microphone at one point and pleaded: "Tell me some good news, 
will you?" 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's three-hour session, the first and probably the most controversial 
of three scheduled public hearings dealing with this year's budget, featured 
requests for more money from many of the county's leading figures, including 
Dist. Atty. Michael Capizzi and Sheriff Brad Gates. And even though budget 
hearings often feature worst-case scenarios by officials pleading for their 
departments' budgets, all agreed that this year's situation is genuinely grim. 
</P>
<P>
The county's fiscal condition, already precarious, is worsened by the prospect 
of further cuts from Sacramento, assuming that state legislators and Gov. 
George Deukmejian can ever overcome their 26-day deadlock over the state 
budget, which provides about $37 million a month to the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation that we are faced with is very serious," County Administrative 
Officer Ernie Schneider acknowledged during the hearing. "Obviously, we have a 
big challenge in front of us." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider's office has recommended cutting 5% from all county department 
budgets in an effort to make up part of a predicted shortfall of $37 million in 
this fiscal year's budget. Some departments have balked at trimming 5%, but 
Schneider and others warn that even further cuts will probably be needed. 
</P>
<P>
During the session, both Capizzi and Gates said they feared that cuts to their 
departments would endanger public safety by making it harder to respond to 
crimes, investigate them and bring the criminals to trial. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts, Capizzi said, "would be devastating to our ability to prosecute 
crimes in this community." 
</P>
<P>
A 5% cut in the district attorney's budget, he said, would jeopardize the jobs 
of 25 of his roughly 400 employees and would force reductions in programs that 
work with abused women and children. It would also weaken the district 
attorney's ability to prepare cases, giving aid and comfort to accused 
criminals and their lawyers, Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates presented a list of cuts that his 2,100-employee department would have to 
make if it absorbed the entire $5.4-million reduction that county staff has 
recommended. Although Gates did not predict layoffs in his department, he said 
that he would have to leave some vacancies unfilled and that officers would 
take on additional burdens, adding to police response time and delaying 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
In the area of health care, county officials predict even larger cuts than 
those being made to law enforcement activities. But Health Care Agency 
officials, who are bracing for reductions of $11 million to $18 million, did 
not speak during Wednesday's session, in part because their budget is closely 
linked to Sacramento's. As a result, they will not have a clear idea of the 
funds available to them until the state approves its budget. 
</P>
<P>
That did not stop more than 20 citizens, many representing local health care 
groups, from voicing their concern. Without exception, the citizens asked 
supervisors to make health care a top priority of the county.

3 TAKE OUT PAPERS FOR COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One day after the City Council called a Nov. 6 election to fill an open council 
seat, three men took out nominating papers Wednesday to run for it. 
</P>
<P>
The potential candidates are Bill T. Vardoulis, 51, a former Irvine councilman; 
Scott E. Peotter, 33, who successfully campaigned last year to exclude 
homosexuals from protection under the city's human-rights ordinance, and Scott 
Coleman, 46, a project superintendent for Marriott Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year council position became open when Sally Anne Sheridan resigned to 
take office as the city's second directly elected mayor. Nominees for the seat 
must gather 30 signatures from registered voters by Aug. 10 to qualify for the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Vardoulis, vice president of Church Engineering Inc. in Irvine, has been 
involved in transportation and finance issues in Irvine and Orange County. He 
was elected to the City Council in 1976 and won reelection in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Peotter, an architect, was president of the Irvine Values Coalition last year 
during its fight to pass Measure N. Voters approved the measure by a 10% 
margin, repealing the section of the city's two-year-old human-rights ordinance 
that outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
After the November victory, Peotter said that the group would concentrate on 
fielding "pro-family" candidates for city offices. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman is a six-year resident of Irvine and a board member of the Woodbridge 
Village Assn. He supervises Marriott building projects, according to his wife, 
Beth. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman and the other potential candidates could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted Tuesday to hold the November election after a resident's 
group filed a petition to block Mary Ann Gaido from filling the council seat. 
Gaido was the third highest vote-getter in the June election, when two council 
seats were filled. Under city law, Gaido would have been entitled to the open 
seat if the petition had not been filed. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Gaido sued the city, alleging that errors on the petition 
invalidated it and demanding that the council award her the seat. A hearing on 
her suit has not been set. TOM McQUEENEY

<P>
The city will spend $6,500 next month on a "verbal judo" course designed to 
train its police officers to defuse potentially dangerous conflicts by using 
body language and the spoken word. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday night unanimously approved the allocation from 
narcotic seizure funds. The course has been acclaimed by many Southern 
California law enforcement agencies as effective in reducing complaints against 
departments, Chief James Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Around 100 officers and dispatchers will attend the program, tentatively set 
for mid-August. JON NALICK

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents will have the chance to tell the City Council just what they think 
about traffic, schools, development and any other topic at a Town Hall meeting 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting starts at 7 and will be in the council chambers at the civic center 
on Birch Street. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment project is one topic likely to be discussed. From street 
widenings to new hotels and office buildings to rezoning of neighborhoods, the 
ambitious project has had a widespread effect on the city. 
</P>
<P>
"City staff and politicians get caught up in pet projects that they are 
concerned about," said Mike Maxfield, spokesman for the city. "Citizens will 
point out different concerns you don't realize they have." 
</P>
<P>
All five council members will attend the meeting, Maxfield said, and city 
manager Frank Benest will serve as moderator. After a resident has spoken, 
Benest will ask a council member to respond. City staff also will be hand.

<P>
The latest and largest addition to the Anaheim Stadium business area, Stadium 
Business Park, will bring four high-rise office towers, a 400-room hotel, a 
health club, an eight-story parking garage and retail store space to the 
growing commercial area in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the nearly $500-million project, approved by the City Council 
on Tuesday, is scheduled to begin in about three years, but may start earlier 
with the development of the Anaheim Arena nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The business park, which will include two 20- and two 16-story buildings, will 
be located across the street from the main entrance of Anaheim Stadium on the 
southwest corner of State College Boulevard and Pacifico Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the project, to be developed and owned by the Los Angeles-based 
Gardner Group, have been two years in the making. 
</P>
<P>
As yet there are no definite agreements with possible tenants, said Steven 
Dietrich, a consultant for the project. LISA MASCARO

YOUNGSTERS GET HOOKED ON FISHING

Roman Castillo sat at a picnic table at Irvine Lake near Orange looking 
dejected. He had been fishing for hours without so much as a nibble. 
</P>
<P>
At 13, the eighth-grader from Fullerton claimed to be an experienced fisherman 
and was frustrated at seeing a novice outdo him. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kid who's never even fished before just threw his pole out there and 
caught something," Castillo said, shaking his head. "I just couldn't believe 
it. I really want to catch something now." 
</P>
<P>
Castillo wasn't the only angler on the lake Wednesday who failed to hook a 
prize. Many of the 500 who participated in the "Fish and Tackle Drugs" youth 
fishing competition also came home empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't seem to matter. Most were having fun just learning how to use 
their new fishing poles, taking boat rides across the lake, getting their faces 
painted and playing carnival games. 
</P>
<P>
The event, organized by the recreation departments of Santa Ana, Orange, 
Placentia, Yorba Linda and Fullerton, was designed to expose youngsters to the 
lifetime hobby of fishing and to discourage them from getting involved in 
drugs, said Larry Chavez, recreation supervisor in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good opportunity for them to get out into a new environment and to 
expose them to some outdoor activities other than baseball and football," 
Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
Eliza Tevan, a 10-year-old from Santa Ana, had never fished before. But after 
catching a five-inch bluegill, she said she was hooked on the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it more than playing with dolls," she said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
But 4-year-old Shaun Little had a hard time Wednesday, because he couldn't find 
his fishing pole. Wearing an oversized California Angels baseball cap, the 
Orange preschooler wandered around the lake in search of his pole. 
</P>
<P>
"I had it, then I lost it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The day also featured an appearance by Jimmy Kim, who won a gold medal in tae 
kwon do at the 1988 Olympics. Kim said he hoped his participation in the event 
would help to steer kids toward high achievement and away from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think kids need positive role models," Kim said. "There are so many bad role 
models out there. I'd like to see all of these kids find something they really 
enjoy and become good at it. If they set goals and work towards achieving those 
goals, they won't have time for drugs." GREG HERNANDEZ

<P>
USE OF PENDLETON WATER TABLE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiations have begun to allow San Clemente to tap a vast water table beneath 
Camp Pendleton, a reservoir that could increase the city's water supply at 
least sevenfold. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Tri-Cities Water District board of directors voted to explore 
the possibility of using the 300-million-gallon water table as an emergency 
storage area. The reservoir would serve a major portion of the South County, 
including San Clemente, Capistrano Beach, parts of Dana Point and the San 
Onofre Nuclear Power Station. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities plan to begin a $270,000 project to test the so-called San Mateo 
water basin for impurities, said Ray Woodside, district general manager. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a big security blanket," Woodside said. "This would be a major 
step if we could generate this reserve." 
</P>
<P>
The Tri-Cities Water District has reached agreements with the Metropolitan 
Water District and Capistrano Beach County Water District and a tentative 
agreement with the city of San Clemente about sharing costs of tests. 
</P>
<P>
If the tests find no major contaminants, that consortium will continue 
negotiating with the U.S. Marines for a million-dollar project to drill wells 
on Camp Pendleton and install water lines between the camp and the South 
County, Woodside said. Water would be purchased from the Metropolitan Water 
District, as it is now, and stored in the basin. 
</P>
<P>
"If feasible, we could store water in the San Mateo basin to be used during 
peak periods of water use," he said, "or emergencies like a broken water line." 
</P>
<P>
Woodside said finding a site for an above-ground reservoir is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Water storage is very expensive," he said. "The cost of land is high, and then 
you have to pay for building a structure to hold the water." Underground 
reservoirs "don't have that problem." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the water level in the district's 48-million-gallon reservoir sank 
to an all-time low of 17 million gallons on Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Through a series of tough water-saving measures enacted by San Clemente, the 
district's largest customer, the reservoir levels have remained higher than 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the reservoir held 42 million gallons, Woodside said. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Morehead, water supervisor for San Clemente, said the underground 
reservoir would provide the city "a substantial supply of new water. It would 
make things a lot more comfortable" during drought conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Builders are not permitted to use water for grading until Sept. 15; residential 
lawn watering is restricted during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Warnings have been issued but nobody has been cited for breaking the water law, 
Morehead said. FRANK MESSINA

DEBEER GAINING IN BATTLE WITH INS; 
</P>
<P>
DEPORTATION FIGHT: THE YOUNG DUTCH NATIVE WHO KILLED HIS GUARDIAN IN DANA POINT 
AFTER BEING MOLESTED IS FREED OF THE GOVERNMENT'S CHARGE OF COMMITTING A CRIME 
OF MORAL TURPITUDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal immigration judge in San Francisco Wednesday bolstered Dutch native 
Joeri DeBeer's hopes of avoiding deportation by dismissing the government's 
charge that DeBeer committed a crime of moral turpitude when he killed his 
abusive guardian as a teen-ager, according to DeBeer's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The judge threw out the charge because DeBeer's conviction was expunged in 
March by a Superior Court judge in Contra Costa County. 
</P>
<P>
But the Immigration and Naturalization Service will press on in its effort to 
deport DeBeer under a second charge, stemming from the expiration of his 
student visa in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the INS said the agency would not grant him permission to leave 
the country by "voluntary departure." That alternative, which is often afforded 
illegal immigrants whom the Justice Department deems to be "of good moral 
character" for the previous five years, would ease DeBeer's efforts to re-enter 
and settle in the United States in the future, which he says he would want to 
do if forced to leave. 
</P>
<P>
DeBeer killed his guardian more than five years ago, and his attorney, John 
Alcorn, says he has shown good moral character since then. But INS San 
Francisco District Director David N. Ilchert vehemently opposes DeBeer's being 
given anything but a deportation order. "The kid's not Jack Armstrong," Ilchert 
said. "If he butchers and barbecues and buries another human being, is he of 
good moral character?" 
</P>
<P>
Immigration Judge Brian Simpson set DeBeer's new deportation hearing for Jan. 
18. He was originally ordered deported in 1986, but a federal immigration 
appeals board recently reopened the case. 
</P>
<P>
"This changes the whole picture," said Alcorn, a Laguna Hills immigration 
attorney. "The one and only issue will be to determine if Joeri's of good moral 
character. I don't know what on earth the government will come up with." 
</P>
<P>
DeBeer was convicted in 1986 of voluntary manslaughter for the killing of 
Phillip Allen Parsons, a child molester who had brought DeBeer to the United 
States at the age of 13 with the permission of DeBeer's mother. 
</P>
<P>
At his trial, DeBeer testified that Parsons had molested him repeatedly, until 
finally, on April 9, 1985, the 17-year-old youth shot Parsons with a borrowed 
gun, took the body to Riverside County and set it afire with gasoline. Then he 
returned to their Dana Point apartment and set it on fire. 
</P>
<P>
A sympathetic jury recommended leniency for DeBeer, and he was sentenced to 
three years' probation and 14 months in Juvenile Hall, which he had already 
served awaiting trial.

PEOPLE: MUSIC FLOWS FROM THIS FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Joan Lesnick sometimes has fun answering the phone in a little girl's voice, 
forcing the caller to ask, "Is your mommy home?" 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that she's 53, has four children and four great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fun," she says. 
</P>
<P>
It's the same voice she uses while singing in her own band. It's reminiscent of 
the tiny-voice style of Wee Bonnie Baker, who recorded the 1930s hit "Oh 
Johnny, Oh Johnny, Oh!" 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't have a singer's voice," said Lesnick. "I have a funny voice, 
and everyone laughs. Kids love it, and when I sing in a club -- even the chef 
comes out to see who's singing." She also plays a banjo and a washboard in her 
novelty band called the Raggtimers, made up of mostly retired people. "I'm the 
youngest one, and I'm no spring chicken but I feel like one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On special occasions a saw player called the Saw C Lady sits in, along with a 
gutbucket player. 
</P>
<P>
The band was one of the featured entertainment groups at the Fourth of July 
Concert on the Green at Irvine High School. They've also performed in Long 
Beach at the Spruce Goose and at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Lesnick played in an all-banjo band in El Monte for eight years before forming 
the Raggtimers. 
</P>
<P>
She also plays banjo with the 33-member Long Beach Senior Band every Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy with my life," said the Irvine woman, whose first job was as a 
roller-skating waitress in a roller rink. She was 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to tell you that music keeps people young," she said during an 
interview at her home. 
</P>
<P>
That's one of the reasons she likes to take her band to retirement homes 
throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"They hug us, and we hug them," she said. "I love to be with them." And she 
likes to tell everyone she is the spitting image of Bette Midler -- or at least 
used to look like her. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm a little heavy, but I can't worry about that because my life is so 
busy," she said in her rat-a-tat speaking delivery. But she notes that "when I 
dress up I really look good." 
</P>
<P>
She also said she was a waitress in a Detroit nightclub where Lily Tomlin was a 
hatcheck girl. 
</P>
<P>
With that fact out of the way, "let's talk about music," she sort of ordered. 
"People should hear music from all over the world because music is love." 
</P>
<P>
When her band performs and plays upbeat songs, "you see men and women jumping 
all around. Songs like that make people happy because they remember the old 
days when they felt good." 
</P>
<P>
And then she added: "Did I tell you I play with another band called High 
Society in Costa Mesa? We play for balls and private parties." 
</P>
<P>
Lesnick said she can play just about any song on her $1,300 banjo and notes 
that she has only taken a few lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a picker, and if I hear it (a song) I can play it," she said. "I'm not 
accomplished, but I have the rest of my life to improve myself." 
</P>
<P>
She also had a parting message: "Tell everyone I can make any party a success." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Fountain Valley resident Sharon Clunk has been presented the 
Honorary Service Award from the California State PTA for her leadership and 
work in various organizations including the PTA. Clunk is also a nominee for 
the 1990 National PTA Outstanding Educator Award for her educational 
relationship with students, parents, PTA and community.

<TEXT>
<P>
A 92-year-old woman was reported in critical condition Wednesday evening after 
suffering a cerebral hemorrhage while testifying in a civil trial here. 
</P>
<P>
A witness said that Lila Coke had been on the stand in Superior Court for about 
20 minutes when she developed difficulty breathing and became dizzy. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, she seemed to freeze, and her lawyer helped her down from the witness 
stand and laid her on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were quickly ushered into a back room and paramedics took Coke to 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Richard J. Beacom declared a mistrial but retained jurisdiction so that 
new jurors can be picked and the trial can begin again quickly when Coke 
recovers. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit, Coke seeks damages for injuries she suffered several years ago 
when she tripped on a garden hose at Leisure World in Seal Beach, where she 
lives.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
EXPOS BATTLE BACK TO EDGE PIRATES IN 10TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Montreal Expos keep trying to make it a three-team race in the National 
League East. The way the youngsters are improving, they might just do it. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night at Montreal, after blowing an early lead and giving up three 
runs in the top of the 10th to the division-leading Pittsburgh Pirates, it 
appeared the Expos would drop seven games behind. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, the Expos battled back to win, 8-7. In the 10th, Andres Galarraga 
singled in one run and Marquis Grissom hit a three-run home run with one out. 
The victory put the Expos five games behind the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates had taken a 7-4 lead in the 10th when Jose Lind and Andy Van Slyke 
had run-scoring singles and Sid Bream added a sacrifice fly. Rookie Bill Sampen 
(8-2), who was on the mound when the Pirates scored the last two runs, wound up 
the winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates scored four runs in the last three innings of regulation to lead, 
4-3, until the bottom of the ninth when Grissom, 23, singled and scored the 
tying run on a double by another inexperienced player, Junior Noboa, 25. 
</P>
<P>
Grissom, 23, hit a home run when he was brought up late last season, but he had 
almost 200 at-bats this season without hitting one. 
</P>
<P>
One thing in favor of the Expos is that neither the Pirates, nor the New York 
Mets, who are only half game out of first, act as if they are ready to take 
charge of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the way my kids battle back," Expo Manager Bob Rodgers said. "With each 
win in this manner, we get more experience. We think we belong in the race." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 2-10, Cincinnati 1-4 -- The Padres, after being in a slump for more 
than a month, have finally found a team they can beat -- the team that is 
leading the West. 
</P>
<P>
By sweeping this doubleheader at San Diego, the Padres beat the Reds for the 
third time in a row. It has been more than a month since the Padres won three 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Whitson went 7 1/3 innings to win the opener. In the second game, winning 
pitcher Calvin Schiraldi hit the second home run of his career. 
</P>
<P>
New York 10, Philadelphia 9 -- Dave Magadan and Darryl Strawberry hit two-run 
home runs at Philadelphia and Kevin McReynolds and Gregg Jefferies each added 
two-run triples. 
</P>
<P>
Although they had a 10-3 lead going into the bottom of the ninth, the Mets 
almost blew it. 
</P>
<P>
Before a batter was retired in the bottom of the ninth, the Phillies had seven 
consecutive singles, cutting the lead to 10-8. Then, with runners on first and 
third, the Mets brought in John Franco. 
</P>
<P>
Franco walked John Kruk to load the bases. Lenny Dykstra then hit into a double 
play, with one run scoring and the potential tying run reaching third. But 
Tommy Herr, who opened the inning with a single, hit a liner that shortstop 
Mario Diaz snared to end it. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 9, Chicago 0 -- John Tudor, given an eight-run cushion in the first 
inning, pitched a five-hitter at St. Louis for his first shutout in more than 
two years. He improved his record to 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Coleman, who had four hits and four steals Tuesday night, started the 
Cardinals off with a single and his 53rd steal. Coleman singled again in the 
inning to give him six hits in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 5, Atlanta 1 -- Danny Darwin held the Braves to five hits at Atlanta, 
won his third start in a row and struck out 10 to earn the Astros' third road 
victory in their last 26 games. DAN HAFNER

RYAN'S FANS STILL FAITHFUL; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: WELL-WISHERS IN ORANGE COUNTY CHEER ON TEXAS PITCHER AS HE TRIED TO 
WIN NO. 300.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Bill Madden was a student at UC Santa Barbara in the '70s, he used to hop 
in a friend's two-seater, fly to Orange County and drive to Anaheim Stadium on 
the nights Nolan Ryan pitched for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Madden still sometimes flies into American League cities to watch Ryan pitch. 
But usually, you can find him with other Ryan fans in front of a television at 
his favorite bar, Silky Sullivan's in Fountain Valley, which always shows the 
Texas Rangers games whenever Ryan's pitching. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? Madden owns the bar, and his establishment has become the 
headquarters for Orange County's unofficial Nolan Ryan fan club. 
</P>
<P>
"When we opened up here, I just started showing Nolan Ryan games, and word got 
around," Madden said. "He's the kind of hero you can really get behind. He's a 
real family man, he's never tried to renegotiate a contract, and he's always 
stood by his word." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan left the game Wednesday night with the Yankees leading, 7-4. The Rangers 
eventually came back to win, 9-7, in 11 innings. Madden, whose spirits soared 
and tumbled with each turn of events Wednesday, plans to fly to Milwaukee to 
witness Ryan's next attempt at victory No. 300. Ryan is expected to pitch 
Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, when Ryan became a free agent after playing for the Houston 
Astros for nine years, Madden organized a widely publicized petition campaign 
to bring Ryan back to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"We got 10,000 signatures," Madden said. "And the Angels were that close to 
signing him." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the bar was crowded with Ryan watchers. While they didn't have 
much to cheer about, they signed a poster to be sent to their hero 
congratulating Ryan -- prematurely, it turned out -- on his milestone victory, 
and consumed specially named concoctions such as the Fireballer (cinnamon 
schnapps and Tabasco sauce) and the 300 Club (don't even ask). 
</P>
<P>
"Keep Chugging," read one inscription on the poster. Everyone in the bar 
certainly did. 
</P>
<P>
Some fans, such as Brendan Devlin of Orange, became Ryan-lovers when he pitched 
for the Angels and have remained devoted. 
</P>
<P>
"To be a Nolan Ryan fan, you don't have to keep up with the numbers or stats," 
Devlin said. "You just have to like the man." 
</P>
<P>
Some devotees are transplanted Texans and come to Silky Sullivan's to cheer on 
one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"When he's done, that'll be it," said Chris Smart, who grew up in Houston and 
now lives in Huntington Beach. "Coaching, managing, who cares? He justs wants 
to go back to Alvin, (Tex.) . . . He's honest." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Erickson, a Fountain Valley native who watches at Silky Sullivan's most of 
Ryan's appearances, said his interest in the 43-year-old pitcher is not like 
some other fans'. "These guys are obsessive-compulsive about it," Erickson 
said. "I've got more important things to do than chase him around the country." 
</P>
<P>
Some "Silk's" regulars say that the biggest Ryanmaniac among them is Chuck 
Baldree, a sales manager who lives in Huntington Beach. Baldree was not at the 
bar Wednesday night; he was in Arlington, Tex., watching the game. 
</P>
<P>
Baldree, a Houston native, has a shrine to Ryan in his Irvine office. It 
includes stacks of baseball cards, photos, newspaper clippings, Ryan figurines, 
books by and about him, and a "limited edition" bronze replica of Ryan's hand 
-- holding a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Baldree recently purchased Ryan's new video, "Feel the Heat," said his wife, 
Nancy,who stayed here Wednesday because she is pregnant and she did not want to 
feel the heat of Texas.

POPCORN POPS UP AS NEW WAY TO PACK BREAKABLE ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Businessman Steve Sommer didn't like feeling guilty about possible damage to 
the environment, so he started substituting popcorn for plastic foam packing in 
the boxes he uses to ship foods. 
</P>
<P>
He has a lot of company from other entrepreneurs in his area. 
</P>
<P>
Popcorn, said Sommer -- the same food people munch in the movies -- "is 
naturally biodegradable, so you may feed it to the birds or use it as mulch in 
your garden," adding that it is probably too stale for human consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Sommer figures also on a tidy fallout for his Alexander Fruit &amp; Trading Co. 
He thinks that packaging-popcorn sales might rival his existing $500,000-a-year 
gourmet wine and food company. Prospective customers are excited by the idea, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are important questions about the unique use for the exploded 
kernels of hard corn. It has to possess all the right cushioning properties. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just started using it and we haven't had any complaints from customers 
yet," said Janet Churchill, packaging boss for Montessori Services in Santa 
Rosa, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The welcome mat for popcorn-for-plastic also was offered by Joan Graham, 
co-owner of a Sonoma crafts gallery, Good Day Sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
She said she started looking for a substitute for plastic packing when some 
customers mentioned that plastic is ecologically unsound and reflected badly on 
her business. 
</P>
<P>
Buyer John Clark, whose company distributes plastic foam packing, said his 
company, Santa Rosa Paper, is interested in popcorn but is awaiting a general 
ruling from United Parcel Service on whether it can be used in any shipping. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the butter-flavored, $2.50-a-pint stuff served in movie houses, Sommer 
charges about $15 for a 14-cubic-foot bag of oil-free popped corn. That's $4 
less than the cost of the same volume of plastic foam kernels. Sommer estimated 
a 30% profit. 
</P>
<P>
Sommer said he is working with a chemist to discover a way to hold popcorn 
together in large shapes such as those used to pack stereo components and other 
fragile devices.

BRIEFCASE: RETAIL / LEISURE: CINNAMON WORKS COOKS UP EXPANSION TO SWEETEN 
PROFITS

<P>
It's a sticky business, but someone's got to do it. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, it's the Cinnamon Works, a local cinnamon roll and cookie concern 
that is about to expand. 
</P>
<P>
Co-owner Colleen Perry said the 3-year-old company is negotiating leases for 
new stores in Anaheim Hills and Irvine. She said the firm recently closed a 
marginal store in Orange in order to concentrate its efforts on the new areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get these stores up and running and see what they will do," Perry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The company has situated its stores in strip centers instead of shopping malls, 
where other cinnamon roll purveyors, such as the Cinnabon Bakery stores in the 
Mall of Orange and Westminster Mall, have already staked their turf. Cinnamon 
Works has an established store in Yorba Linda and supplies its sugary 
confections to Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm, she said. Perry added that 
she recently cut back on her advertising, but sales have increased, apparently 
on the strength of word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"The business has continually grown since we started up," she said.

NEWPORT MAN AND SONS CHARGED WITH DEFRAUDING BANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newport Beach man and his two sons will be arraigned next month on charges of 
defrauding 13 banks and other financial institutions around the country of $8 
million through a complex real estate scheme. 
</P>
<P>
John M. Coughlan Sr., 74, was indicted on 17 counts of mail and wire fraud 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
John M. Coughlan Jr., 54, of Long Beach and Errol Coughlan, 49, of Malibu were 
indicted on the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office has alleged that the men would borrow money for a 
family construction business they claimed was working on various real estate 
projects and use another of their companies -- Eagle Bonds &amp; Insurance 
Brokers in Agoura -- to provide the bonds to back up those loans, assuring 
lenders that their money was safe. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment claims that the money -- obtained in the mid-1980s -- was not 
used for construction but instead for the Coughlans' own enrichment, including 
the purchase of three Rolls-Royces. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Coughlans denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"They intend to defend themselves vigorously," said Terry Christensen, attorney 
for Errol and John Jr. "We feel this is based on years of misinformation and 
misunderstanding, one assumption piled upon another." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Kirschner, attorney for John Coughlan Sr., called the charges 
"outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
He said his client "was not an officer, not a director, (and) not a control 
person" of either company. GREGORY CROUCH

DEFENSE FIRMS WARNED OF FUTURE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's defense industry, already feeling the pinch of lower government 
spending, should expect another wave of cuts in 1995, when Washington will 
review and probably trim the nation's conventional ground forces, a top U.S. 
Department of Commerce official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no place for complacency for the American businessman in the 1990s," 
Dennis Kloske, Commerce's undersecretary for export administration, told Orange 
County executives Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Only those companies nimble enough to shift their military technology to serve 
the international commercial markets are likely to survive this decade of 
cutbacks in military spending, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be two kinds of American (defense) companies that will emerge in 
this decade of cutbacks in military spending -- the quick and the hungry," 
Kloske warned. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the impact of domestic budget trimming, Kloske said a united 
Germany and a strong European Economic Community will become formidable trade 
competitors in the next few years. Combined with a "strong Pacific economy, led 
by Japan," these factors will weed out weak and unresponsive companies in the 
U.S. defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
Kloske, visiting to brief local companies on the latest developments in 
national export regulations, said the Commerce Department is beefing up its 
staff to help defense-related companies adjust to new markets. 
</P>
<P>
One area that promises a lot of growth is in electronics surveillance 
equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This equipment will be in big demand among Western allies to monitor all the 
arms control agreements," Kloske said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Eastern European countries will need diagnostic and medical 
equipment and computers to modernize their hospitals and businesses, he said. 
Likely buyers for such equipment include East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia 
and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Commerce Department is waiving export license requirements on more 
than 100,000 items by the end of the year, a variety of technologies will 
remain under tight control, Kloske said. 
</P>
<P>
Companies interested in selling products, especially in the Eastern European 
markets, should talk to Commerce Department representatives to find out what 
items are still controlled, he said.

AST'S RECORD EARNINGS OUTDO WALL STREET FORECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Continuing to outperform Wall Street's expectations, AST Research Inc. said 
Wednesday that its earnings rose to a record $35.1 million last year on a 17% 
increase in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine personal computer maker, which celebrated its 10th anniversary in 
business Wednesday, said earnings for its fiscal year ended June 30 were $35.1 
million. The company lost $7.5 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 17% to $533.8 million, up from $456.5 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the news, AST's stock jumped $2.25 per share -- a 11% gain -- to 
close at $22.625 Wednesday in active over-the-counter trading, with more than 
1.9 million shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts said the strong performance reflects AST's success in 
shifting toward the high end of the personal computer market. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Vleeschhouwer, analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. in New York, said the 
company's performance has exceeded Wall Street's expectations for the past four 
quarters. He said he expects AST to perform well in the current quarter, which 
ends in September. 
</P>
<P>
Benny Lorenzo, an analyst with Volpe, Covington &amp; Welty in San Francisco, 
said the company's performance was better than he expected for the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"This market has been ruthless for computer companies, but AST stands out 
because they just keep rolling along with better earnings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its sales last year were also driven by strong international 
revenue, which accounted for 36% of sales, up from 32% a year earlier. 
International sales, which were especially strong in the Far East, accounted 
for 39% of total sales in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The key marketing, product and international expansion strategies adopted 
during the year successfully contributed to this record financial performance," 
said Safi U. Qureshey, president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Some other computer makers, such as Advanced Logic Research Inc. in Irvine, 
have said their sales have been adversely affected by a shortage of the Intel 
Corp. 386SX microchip. But Qureshey said AST has been unaffected by the 
shortage because it was able to secure an adequate supply of the chips before 
they became scarce. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which also makes expansion board products to boost the performance 
of PCs, reported fourth-quarter net income of $15.2 million, a six-fold 
increase from $2.5 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 23% to a 
record $151.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the company also took steps to strengthen its balance 
sheet. 
</P>
<P>
At year's end, the company had $92.3 million in cash, contrasted with $18.5 
million a year ago. Inventories were $73.5 million, compared to $91.6 million a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the company redeemed $47.5 million in convertible subordinated debt, a 
move that will eliminate more than $4 million in future interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
AST said that during the past year it introduced 12 new computer systems and 
three enhancement board products. Qureshey said the company expects to announce 
three significant products during the next year. 
</P>
<P>
One of those products will be AST's first portable laptop computer. Another 
will be a personal computer that will use multiple processors for faster 
calculation of data. 
</P>
<P>
The company also plans to start production in August of a personal computer 
specifically designed for the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
AST'S PERFORMANCE 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter ended June 30, AST Research Inc. reported earnings of 
$15.2 million as its revenues rose 23% to $151.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Figures are in thousands, except per share data.

NEW HOME SALES UP 2.2% OVER '89; PRICES 0.7% LOWER

Spurred by declining new home prices as builders begin bringing lower-priced 
models to market, home sales in Orange County last month climbed 2.2% from a 
year earlier, a regional real estate data service reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Total sales of 4,266 new and used homes and condominiums were up from 4,173 a 
year earlier and represented the fifth-highest level in the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
June sales were virtually unchanged from May's 4,261 units, but industry 
analysts say even a small increase is a good sign because May is a 
traditionally strong month for home sales. 
</P>
<P>
And in what may be the best news in months for new home shoppers, the June 
median price for a new home in the county was down 11.7% from May -- to the 
rest of $251,703 from $285,156. Compared to a year earlier, June's new home 
median also was 0.7% lower than the $253,433 figure for June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The resale market, which typically accounts for 75% or more of all sales in the 
county, remained sluggish with June's total sales of 3,539 units reflecting a 
nearly 1% drop from 3,573 sales in May. 
</P>
<P>
June's resales were up 6% from 3,337 units in June, 1989, however. 
</P>
<P>
The median resale price of $249,917 was up 0.6% from $248,336 in May and was 1% 
higher than the $247,357 posted for June, 1989, TRW reported. 
</P>
<P>
TRW's monthly housing summaries combine single family and attached homes in the 
new and resale categories. 
</P>
<P>
The combined median sales price for new and resale homes in the county last 
month was $250,331, up a scant 0.7% from $248,638 in June, 1989, and down 2.2% 
from May's $256,043.

SHOW UP IN TUBE SOCKS AND YOU'LL BE LEFT IN THE DUST

The latest victory in the Tour de France may have made Greg LeMond a household 
name with the shot-and-beer crowd, but there's a not-so-well-kept secret about 
cycling: it can be more cliquish and snobbish than a tony Newport Beach 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the cycling per se, but what you ride and what you wear. They may be 
reluctant to admit it, but road bike enthusiasts take to high fashion like a 
gaggle of debutantes preparing for the coming-out ball in Savannah. 
</P>
<P>
Show up in a pair of white tube socks and a T-shirt for the morning ride and 
you're likely to draw a snicker or two from the pack. The wrong kind of helmet 
or a loose-fitting jersey may get you cast as a dilettante, someone unworthy of 
sharing a pace line. 
</P>
<P>
At times, it seems you can do nothing right. One of LeMond's local fans went so 
far as to buy the $5,000 LeMond carbon fiber bike and has taken to wearing his 
rainbow world champion jersey. But because he doesn't ride like LeMond, he's 
often dismissed as some kind of quirky Elvis impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
But despite all this elitism, fashion and etiquette do have their place on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
If you want freedom, try mountain biking. If the world of racing bikes moves to 
the strains of Beethoven, mountain biking is sung in the three-chord harmony of 
Merle Haggard, embodying more of the true spirit of the Old West. Show up on a 
mountain bike in your pajamas and chances are no one will blink an eye. But try 
that with a group of racers and they'll drop you on the first hill. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, there's a little pressure about what you wear," said Jim Schmidt, 
owner of Bicycles Etc., an El Toro bike shop that co-sponsors Cycles Veloce, 
perhaps Orange County's most elite racing team. "Particularly if you're riding 
with a group, you want to fit in. When you get to a certain level, like these 
racers are, there is a certain amount of peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm under a lot of peer pressure because I don't shave my legs, for instance," 
he said. "But I don't show up in soccer socks up to my knees, either." 
</P>
<P>
So before you go clashing pink shorts with a green jersey, consider what is in, 
and what is out this season on the bike trail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JERSEYS 
</P>
<P>
Keeping in mind that you don't want to look like a bum -- would you wear a 
sneakers to a black tie dinner? T-shirts and similar varieties of leisure wear 
are definitely out. That leaves bike jerseys, with the hand rear pouches to 
store spare tubes, perhaps something to eat and a quarter to call your spouse 
if the unthinkable happens. But alas, not just any jersey will do. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago team jerseys (7-Eleven, Coors Light, Cafe de Colombia, etc.) were 
the rage of the streets, and last year the Japanese-made Descente jerseys 
reigned supreme. But sales of both team jerseys and the Descente lines are down 
as bikers opt for more personal attire. Some purists even see those who wear 
team jerseys as cheap impostors, wanna-bes, dreamers. High fashion this season 
includes artsy styles in bright oranges, greens, yellows, pinks and blues. It's 
still acceptable to wear the jersey of your bike maker (Colnago, Pinarello, 
Eddy Merckx, DeRosa) or that of a local club. 
</P>
<P>
 What's Hot: Schmidt of Bicycles Etc. reports that Giordana's jerseys 
emblazoned with Mickey Mouse are a big hit. Other shops are doing a brisk 
business with the new Ultima line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOCKS 
</P>
<P>
The first rule of serious cycling is this: No tube socks. Nothing will get you 
labeled as a hobo faster than donning white tube socks hiked up well above the 
ankle. Cycling socks provide excellent cushioning and sweat absorption, and 
let's face it, they look better. Most are white with the manufacturer's logo at 
the top. 
</P>
<P>
 What's Hot: neon green, pink, yellow and orange socks, color coordinated with 
the jersey, of course. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HELMETS 
</P>
<P>
Many road bike purists, perhaps aping the European professionals, ride without 
helmets. They should know better. Ask any paramedic and he's bound to have a 
horror story or two about serious injuries involving bikers not wearing 
protective headgear. There are a variety available, and as long and they've 
passed federal safety standards, they are suitable for the road. But alas, just 
any helmet won't do for the fashion-conscious rider. Steer clear of those that 
resemble motorcycle or football helmets, the kind you find thrown together in a 
cardboard box marked "on sale" in your local bike shop. Instead, opt for the 
plastic foam models that take nylon covers, which can be conveniently changed 
to match the color of your jersey, socks, and pants. 
</P>
<P>
What's Hot: The Vetta Corsa Light and the ever popular Giro worn by LeMond. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AEROBARS 
</P>
<P>
Ever since LeMond used the U-shaped aerobars to win the Tour de France last 
year, it seemed everybody had to have them. A lot of people bought them, and a 
lot of people still don't know how to ride with them. Triathletes have fitted 
their bikes with these aerobars, used to put the rider in a low tuck position, 
for several years to great benefit. The problem is the bars were designed for 
relatively flat, straight riding -- not for the pack and hill riding that is so 
popular in Orange County. Moreover, changing position on and off the bars can 
be tricky at best and dangerous at worse. In short, you have to know what 
you're doing, and most of the faddists who were quick to snatch them up simply 
don't know how to handle them. 
</P>
<P>
Most serious road bikers sneer at the popularity of these aerobars, viewing 
them as a cheap fad embraced by those who know no better, and wisely veer well 
clear of aerobar-using riders for fear they may swerve into their path. 
</P>
<P>
 What's Hot: For those accomplished triathletes who actually know how to use 
them, the new Scott and Profile models with the grip shifting at the top of the 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BIKING SHORTS 
</P>
<P>
Basic black is still the standard but nobody has yet to match the quality of 
chamois (the soft leather used as bike short padding) used by Italian 
manufacturers. Discount stores sell shorts for as little as $20, but do 
yourself a favor and spring for some high-quality shorts in the $80 range. 
</P>
<P>
 What's Hot: Vitorre Gianni shorts with blue, green, pink and red horizontal 
stripes in the back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GLASSES 
</P>
<P>
Nothing looks better than the mirrored, neon-framed biking glasses that enjoy 
such immense popularity. Need we say more? 
</P>
<P>
What's Hot: Oakley cycling shades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMPONENTS 
</P>
<P>
Bikers are notoriously catty when it comes to their bikes, and the attention to 
detail covers everything from shifting systems to handlebars, handlebar tape, 
cycle computers, bars, stems, saddles, seat posts and clip-less pedals. Shimano 
is the undisputed leader in indexed shifting systems, but Campagnolo reigns 
supreme for workmanship and aesthetic appeal. Still, Shimano gets it done 
cheaper and more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 What's Hot: Shimano's eight-speed Dura-Ace system with Hyperglide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BIKES 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is the bike itself. And in the end, the snob appeal remains 
where it has been for years: with the Italians. The world's finest racing bikes 
are still made there, built for speed and hills with classic European geometry 
and Columbus steel tubing. Last year, thanks in part to the popularity of the 
7-Eleven team, the Belgian-made Eddy Merckx bike in the team's trademark red, 
green and white colors was one of the hottest bikes on the street, but sales of 
it have cooled. The new carbon fiber Greg LeMond bike is selling well, but its 
price (about $5,000 fully loaded) seems out of step with other, classic custom 
bikes. 
</P>
<P>
High-end U.S. custom bike makers have made great strides, toying with advanced 
composites and carbon fiber, but also fiddling with the basic design enough to 
make a purist scream. The composite Kestrel, made in California, is a big 
favorite among triathletes. But for that kind of money, most aficionados will 
always go Italian. 
</P>
<P>
What's Hot: Custom Italian bikes with Columbus SLX tubing.

Barbie has one of her own. So do Donald and Mickey, as well as the Muppets and 
the whole gang from Sesame Street. 
</P>
<P>
Children's magazines have come a long way since the days of those dated, 
dog-eared periodicals that used to linger in dentists' offices. Today, they're 
a blossoming slice of the magazine market, and the range of subject material is 
broad, going far beyond just "fanzines" of licensed cartoon characters, 
television shows and products. In fact, there are nearly as many magazines as 
there are children's interests. 
</P>
<P>
Is the child in your life interested in science? "3-2-1 Contact" might strike a 
chord. A budding naturalist? Try "Ranger Rick" or "National Geographic World." 
Wild about baseball, skateboarding, soccer? You can't miss with "Sports 
Illustrated for Kids." 
</P>
<P>
And with the long, lazy days of summer stretching ahead, what better way to 
supplement a holiday reading list or capture the attention of a reluctant 
reader? Magazines are easy to pick up and put down, highly portable (good for 
plane travel and trips to the beach), and reasonably priced. For about the same 
cost as a single hardcover book, one may purchase a year's subscription to a 
child's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say anything that gets a kid to read and turn off the television is a good 
addition to a home," says Patricia Berry, a senior editor at "Sports 
Illustrated for Kids." 
</P>
<P>
Kate Waters, editor of Scholastic Professional Books in New York, and a writer 
and former children's librarian at the Boston Public Library, concurs. 
"Children adopt reading habits by modeling, by watching their parents," she 
says. "The younger a child can have something that comes to the home in his 
name, that looks like what their mom and dad has, the younger they'll sit down 
and mimic that behavior and adopt it. So it's vital." 
</P>
<P>
Waters has especially high praise for interactive magazines -- those that 
accept submissions from children, as well as involve them in activities such as 
puzzles and games. She calls them "vital for creativity. If a child can submit 
art or a poem or something, it makes their work, their learning work -- 
reading, writing, calculating, listening, and all the rest of it -- worth 
something. It gives it a wider relevance than just school tests." 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the growing number of magazines that publish student writing, 
Christine Lord, an editor at "Merlyn's Pen" in Rhode Island, suggests that 
"part of the reason for this, is that kids are just naturally interested in 
what other kids are writing." 
</P>
<P>
Lord feels this particular type of magazine is especially important for 
adolescents, who can be "a tough audience to reach," since working toward the 
goal of being published can help "give them a certain validity." 
</P>
<P>
For reluctant readers, she notes, magazines are "a natural tool. (Books and) 
textbooks don't always do the trick, especially for at-risk kids, and getting 
them to sit with a magazine is a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
For those looking to zero in on a magazine for the child in their life, Waters 
offers these tips: 
</P>
<P>
* Start with a trip to your local public library. Take a look at what's 
available there, and ask the children's librarian for recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
* Be sure that the magazine is subscribed to in the child's name. "It's very 
important that it comes to the child, that it's their mail," Waters says. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider choosing a magazine that doesn't necessarily only reflect your 
child's interest. "One of the wonderful things about Time and Newsweek for all 
of us," Waters notes, "is that we find ourselves reading things we never 
thought we'd be interested in. You use them as expansion tools." 
</P>
<P>
* Save the magazines. The material in children's magazines is rarely 
time-sensitive. Children can enjoy rereading issues, and may be able to refer 
to them in the future for school projects. 
</P>
<P>
* Finally, keep in mind that there is generally an eight-week start-up period 
for magazine subscriptions. If this is to be a birthday or holiday gift, order 
well in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective buyers many also want to take into consideration the balance of ads 
in the magazine, Waters says. Although magazines aimed at preschoolers don't 
carry ads, some of the ones for older children do. Parents may want to weigh 
the cost of a handful of sneaker and candy ads against the benefits advertising 
brings to a magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you can't help but respect the fact that advertising allows you as an 
editor to do more," Berry says. At Sports Illustrated for Kids, for example, 
good advertising support means that "we're able to do what we can graphically 
and artistically, and get the best writers." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, a little parental research is well worth the effort, if the result 
is a magazine that sparks a child's interest. Besides, adds Berry, it's 
important to "know what you're buying."

HISTORY: A WOMEN'S RIGHTS ACTIVIST NAMED JEAN WIRT SHERWOOD CAME TO A MEADOW IN 
BOULDER IN 1904 AND IMMEDIATELY SAW IT AS A VACATION RETREAT FOR THE WEARY.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the early 1900s, women did not have the vote, and many were working long 
hours at routine jobs in stores and offices for little pay. It was considered 
improper for a single woman to eat her midday meal at a public lunch counter or 
restaurant if she was alone. And for an unmarried woman to take a vacation by 
herself was to seriously jeopardize her reputation. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, a group of 24 young women led by Jean Wirt Sherwood formed the 
Altura-Lend-a-Hand Circle. They maintained a clubroom where women could rest 
and eat their lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood, the daughter of an Ohio Congregational minister, had attended Mount 
Olivet College in Michigan and received a degree from Oberlin. In Chicago, she 
founded Saturday tours for children and Sunday concerts at the Art Institute, 
and one of her goals was to ease the lives of women in the city who earned 
their own living. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, summer chautauquas -- named for the original Chautauqua Lake in 
New York -- were popular. At scenic spots throughout the country, entire 
families often gathered during the summer in tents and cottages to enjoy 
lectures, concerts, plays and outdoor activities. 
</P>
<P>
In 1904, Sherwood lectured on art at a chautauqua in Boulder, where she had 
been impressed with the high grassy meadow dotted with wildflowers outside her 
cottage. Blue penstemon, pink wild roses and yellow daisies grew against a 
backdrop of sheer rosy cliffs and dark green pines. Wouldn't it be wonderful, 
she thought, if young women who spent long hours in offices and factories had a 
vacation place of their own like this. 
</P>
<P>
That autumn, Jean Sherwood outlined to Altura members her plan for such a 
vacation haven. Members were caught with the idea. She spoke to other 
organizations in the city. Soon, $1,500 had been raised. No more contributions 
were asked for. "This should not be a charity," Sherwood said. She proposed an 
organization in which the vacationers -- the women themselves -- could invest. 
</P>
<P>
In 1910, the Holiday House Assn. of Chicago was incorporated as a nonprofit 
organization, with Sherwood as president. Trustees at one time or another 
included Lorado Taft, the sculptor; Jane Addams of Hull House; Mary A. 
Barthleme, judge of Juvenile Court in Chicago; Lena B. McCauley, art editor of 
the Chicago Evening Post, and Charles Burkholder, treasurer of the Chicago Art 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood purchased "two lots in the best location on a mountainside" on what 
was then little more than a dirt path along one side of the Boulder chautauqua 
grounds. Later she purchased two more. She gave the lots to the association for 
the site of a vacation cottage to be held as a permanent trust for 
self-supporting single women, and to provide an inexpensive, healthful 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
The association had no endowment or affiliation with any other organization. 
Stock in it was sold in blocks of $10. The owner of a block was entitled to a 
room for two weeks each summer, paying only a nominal weekly sum -- $4.50 the 
first year -- for board. 
</P>
<P>
The association sent out circulars telling of the "rest and inspiration" to be 
found in "mountain altitudes." Businesses bought stock for their employees, but 
subscriptions came largely from the women themselves. In three months, the 
money necessary to start building was collected. 
</P>
<P>
On March 7, 1911, ground was broken for Blue Bird Cottage. The cost of 
construction was $8,500 and furniture was shipped from Chicago. On June 15, the 
cottage opened with Sherwood as hostess. 
</P>
<P>
Why was it called "Blue Bird?" Maeterlinck's "Bluebird of Happiness" may have 
suggested the name. But a Boulder newspaper quoted Sherwood as saying, "A 
bluebird named it. A bird made her nest in the cottage porch and hatched her 
young before any of the girls came to live there. It was named for our first 
guest." 
</P>
<P>
Forty-three women vacationed at Blue Bird that first year, "stenographers, 
typists, dressmakers, clerks in stores and offices, teachers, nurses." In the 
Chicago Evening Post, columnist McCauley paid tribute to the function it 
fulfilled: "The lot of many a brilliant young woman who takes a place in the 
ranks of commercial enterprise may be compared to that of the gentle animal 
hitched in the treadmill or at a water wheel. . . . The industrial system robs 
her of joyful hope, and unless a helping hand is reached out to invite her away 
from the killing pace of monotony, each year finds her more depleted and nearer 
exhaustion. Blue Bird Cottage . . . is the realization of the dreams of women 
in business in Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
As hostess at Blue Bird Cottage, Jean Sherwood planned the meals and directed 
the kitchen, "just as I once did for my own family." Blue Bird was her home for 
14 years. When the cottage opened, two stenographers took over the cooking. The 
guests did the sweeping and dusting. Each took care of her own room. In 1913, a 
professional cook was hired. In 1917, Emma Tracy, a public stenographer in 
Chicago, came for a vacation, and stayed as business manager until 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Under Sherwood's direction, there were no rules at the cottage except "to do 
nothing that would make others uncomfortable." She arranged for artists, 
musicians and lecturers to put on programs there. A fifth lot that she 
purchased became a sunken garden. Blue Bird property now had frontage on an 
entire city block. 
</P>
<P>
"The hospitable stone cottage is set in the midst of gardens," The Christian 
Science Monitor reported then, "Roses bloom from May until September, and the 
girls may gather all they want." The Monitor quoted Sherwood: "I am more and 
more impressed with the influence of the garden. . . . When girls first felt 
its beauty and peace, I have seen their eyes fill up with tears." 
</P>
<P>
An article in Follett's Weekly Magazine signed "By One of the Girls" described 
the summer of 1912 at Blue Bird Cottage. "It was the most refreshing and 
inspiring vacation I ever had. . . . Day after day, girls would come worn out 
and hopeless, too tired to do anything for a week but sleep and eat, and at the 
end of another week, full of life and spirit, eager to climb every mountain 
within sight. . . . Real fun and relaxation and health are . . . the main 
objects of the home, and every day there are merry groups starting out for 
mountain climbs, beefsteak fries, ranch trips or burro parties." 
</P>
<P>
In the second year of the Blue Bird Cottage, tents were set up on the lawn and 
neighboring houses rented to accommodate the guests. In 1914, the association 
built a bungalow facing the sunken garden. Later, another one was built. In 
Chicago, women who had vacationed at Blue Bird formed a club to raise more 
money. At first the cottage was only open for vacations in the summer. By 1917, 
it was open all year. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve miles up a canyon from Boulder at the end of a steep, rocky road lay the 
nearly deserted village of Gold Hill. Its crumbling buildings had empty 
windows, but in the 1860s it was a booming town where prospectors flocked to 
dig for gold. The log hotel, closed for many years, had once housed 40 miners 
on the day shift and 40 more who worked at night. 
</P>
<P>
By 1921, Blue Bird Cottage was too small to accommodate the "Bluebirds" -- as 
the visiting women came to be called. The Holiday House Assn. voted to buy the 
hotel at Gold Hill as a Bluebird summer camp. They raised the purchase price of 
$350 in five minutes. Five years later, the Bluebirds built a lodge adjoining 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the popularity of a Colorado vacation among suffragists was that in 
Colorado women had the right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
To promote her idea of a cooperative vacation house, Sherwood spent 10 days 
lecturing at women's clubs in Kansas City in 1922. Kansas City women purchased 
a house in Boulder, where 205 working women vacationed during the first year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1926, when she was 80, Sherwood retired as hostess at Blue Bird. A women's 
organization in Boulder commissioned a portrait of her. At its unveiling in 
1929, the president of the Art Assn. of Boulder said, "What a privilege it has 
been to know Jean Sherwood. For her life has been a sort of cumulative 
benediction to those who know her." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Sherwood organized the Boulder Art Assn. and Artists Guild. She gave her 
collection of more than 10,000 photographs and prints of paintings and 
sculpture to the Chicago Art Institute to be used in schools and traveling 
galleries. Her vision of a vacation home for self-supporting working women 
brought nearly 5,000 "Bluebirds" to Colorado. At her passing in Boulder at the 
age of 92, the town turned out to honor her. 
</P>
<P>
And what of Blue Bird Cottage and Blue Bird Lodge? They continued in operation 
for a time after 1951. But "Blue Birds Have No Nest," read a headline in the 
Boulder Daily Camera of Aug. 12, 1958. Blue Bird Cottage had been sold as a 
private residence. The lodge at Gold Hill continued to operate as a Bluebird 
retreat until 1961. Since then, purchasers have operated the dining hall as a 
restaurant from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
The Bluebirds have flown from Colorado. Only old-time Boulder residents 
identify the original Blue Bird Cottage, now set behind pine trees and 
surrounded by city residences. But visitors to the old Gold Hill Inn will find 
the parlors furnished almost as the Blue Birds left them. And some may still 
recall the many working women who found solace in the mountain air of Colorado.

A wronged youth seeks revenge against a repressive society and, with the help 
of his vagabond band, rallies the locals to revolt, earns the devotion of his 
countrymen and the love of a comely maid. 
</P>
<P>
And get this: He's doing it in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, legend's most romantic renegade swaggers onto the Irvine Valley 
College campus in an open-air production of "The Adventures of Robin Hood," a 
presentation of the Irvine Valley Theatrefaire for Children. Closing 
performances of this family adventure are scheduled tonight through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Director Blake Gould has given us a virile, swashbuckling "Robin Hood" filled 
with pageantry, romance and action. The trumpets blast, the banners whip in the 
evening breeze, the ladies swoon and, in several highly realistic clashes 
staged by fight directors Bob Barnett and Christopher Villa, the good guys beat 
the living daylights out of the baddies. 
</P>
<P>
The show's creator, Paul Downey, provided a rough script to Gould, who 
ultimately "fleshed it out" to include 30 colorful characters, from the witty 
Friar Tuck to the diabolical Sir Guy of Gisbourne. 
</P>
<P>
Gould has assembled a capable cast of local adults and high school students, 
headed by 18-year-old Martin Noyes. A senior at Irvine High School who made his 
Theatrefaire debut at 12 in "Treasure Island," Noyes gives us a swaggering, 
passionate Robin, a fellow quick with the wisecracks and quicker still with a 
bow and arrow. It's no surprise when the feisty Maid Marian (a fetching 
Kathleen Simmons) decides to ditch the royal life to be at his side. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Christopher is delightfully nasty as Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Prince John's 
devilish henchman, and Mark Downie is valiant and true as Robin's right-hand 
man Will Scarlett. Ron Sheehan as Friar Tuck and Tammy Calder as Mistress Bess 
Quigley provide plenty of laughs throughout, and Jose Lambert is strong as King 
Richard the Lion Heart (who, unfortunately for England and the audience, 
doesn't appear until late in the show). 
</P>
<P>
With the liberal use of live trees, rustic wood pieces and towering flats, set 
designer Wally Huntoon manages to turn a somewhat bland college courtyard into 
a variety of romantic settings, from a humble country village to the grand 
chambers of Nottingham Castle to the most remote corners of Sherwood Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann Griego's costumes are rich in color and texture, especially the 
studded leather jerkins worn by the sheriff of Nottingham and his men and the 
coronation vestments of the bishop of Black Cannons. Eric Kerns' taped 
accompaniment, which ranges from simple lute music to thunderous 
orchestrations, is fine but tends to be overly loud during the fight scenes. 
</P>
<P>
One other complaint. Theatrefaire organizers might consider selling a quieter 
brand of munchies. Even the most imaginative theatergoer will have a hard time 
transporting himself to Medieval England while his fellow patrons crunch potato 
chips and crinkle popcorn bags. How about a nice leg o' mutton or a tankard of 
ale instead? 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1982 by Gould and his wife, Charlene, Irvine Valley Theatrefaire 
presents two family shows each summer on the campus of Irvine Valley College. 
Earlier this month, they presented "The Everyday Adventures of Harriet 
Handleman, Super Genius," an original work by local playwright Greg Atkins. 
Next season's schedule will be expanded to include performances of "The Beauty 
and the Beast" at the new Irvine Barclay Theatre in March.

EX-BOLSHOI PAIR TRY NEW WORKS, ENJOY FREEDOM

<TEXT>
<P>
Artistic freedom and growth are still very much on the minds of two former 
principal dancers who left the Bolshoi Ballet in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't had a new production for 10 years. Ten years!" said Alla 
Khaniashvili-Artyushkina after teaching a class Tuesday at the Jimmie DeFore 
Dance Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Both lay the blame at the feet of artistic director Yuri Grigorovich. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, he was a great choreographer -- 20 years ago," said Vitali 
Artyushkin, Alla's husband and also a former Bolshoi principal. "But now time 
is passing and passing, and he's not doing new performances. . . . Under his 
direction, I think the company is going down, too. You can see this when they 
will be here." 
</P>
<P>
(The Bolshoi will appear at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, Aug. 7 
through 19.) 
</P>
<P>
"In the Bolshoi, we were always under pressure," Vitali remembered. "You 
couldn't feel free because of administration stuff and inside fighting. It was 
not a good situation. Nobody is happy now in the Bolshoi. Everybody calls us 
and says, 'A catastrophe is coming. We are all unhappy. We are looking to do 
something else.' " 
</P>
<P>
Alla had been with the Bolshoi for nine years; Vitali, for five. She danced 
classical roles; he was often cast in character roles. Alla will teach a class 
in classical variations at the DeFore studios on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Since coming to the United States, the two have been doing the new works and 
productions they wanted as guest artists, including ballets by seminal New York 
City Ballet founder George Balanchine. 
</P>
<P>
"We danced Balanchine's 'Allegro Brillante.' For us, it was a new performance. 
It's very difficult, but it's beautiful. We danced his 'Apollo' and 
'Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux.' He is a genius. The works are good, and we are 
free." 
</P>
<P>
The two have been living in Los Angeles and appearing as guests with other 
companies, including John Clifford's fledgling Ballet of Los Angeles. (They 
danced with BLA in New York in April, but did not appear with the company when 
it made its first appearance in Los Angeles a week later.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult and new for us," Alla admitted. "In Russia, there is no 
problem. The government sponsors the arts. But here we are free to do 
appearances as guest artists." 
</P>
<P>
They are slated to dance the leads in "Giselle" with the Palos Verdes Ballet in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very small company," Alla said. "But we like to do 'Giselle,' and we 
like to show the Russian 'Giselle.' " 
</P>
<P>
While Alla declined to give her age ("I'm very young," she said), Vitali 
suggested: "An artist is young until he can't dance." 
</P>
<P>
Neither is optimistic that the political and economic changes occurring in the 
Soviet Union will benefit artists. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is thinking about dancers and theaters in the Soviet Union," Vitali 
said. "It is not a good time for us. There is nothing to eat. There are 
political problems. All the republics who would like to be independent. Nobody 
knows which way this independence will go, whether there will be some kind of 
war between them and what will happen. People are all angry. . . . And the 
government doesn't know how to control this, so now is a difficult time in the 
Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Both have left their parents behind. She is from the Georgian Republic. He is 
from Estonia. They brought their 6-year-old daughter with them. 
</P>
<P>
"She dances beautifully," Alla said. "But she's too young to study ballet." 
</P>
<P>
Vitali said: "Maybe she will be a dancer. She likes to dance very much. But 
nobody knows. We'll let her go her own way without any pressure."

Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is the largest appropriation

FISHINGBIOLOGISTS' STUDY OF SAND BASS HABITS RESUMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last week on two twilight trips with volunteer anglers aboard, First String, 
Russ Izors' boat from 22nd Street Landing, caught 742 sand bass. Mac Oliphan 
and Paul Gregory, biologists from the Department of Fish and Game, then tagged 
and released the fish. 
</P>
<P>
That marked the beginning of the second year of the catch, tag and release 
study of sand bass migration, in which the department seeks answers concerning 
the spawning habits of the fish at South Bay beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory said that little is known about this species of bass and it may take 
two more years to complete the study. 
</P>
<P>
According to Oliphan, 28 tags from last year were returned. The average 
distance the fish traveled before being caught again was just under 10 miles. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 1,400 bass wearing tags from the past two years of the tag 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers fishing from a party boat can give the tag to the crew, who will then 
record where the fish was landed and the fisherman's name and address. The 
angler will receive a $5 reward by mail. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers fishing from private boats can mail the tag with the information to the 
Department of Fish and Game, 330 Golden Shores, Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Rowan Henry of King Harbor Marlin Club battled a swordfish for 10 hours and 55 
minutes that he hooked 10 miles out of San Diego using a mackerel for bait on a 
50-pound test line. 
</P>
<P>
The fish weighed in at 129 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Venice Anglers will hold their third annual Shark Tournament this weekend 
with a top prize of $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Weigh-in will be at Marina del Rey each day until 5 p.m. Information: Jack 
Bailey at (213) 823-9715.

SOVIET COSMONAUTS CLOSE FAULTY HATCH IN 3 1/2-HOUR SPACEWALK

Two Soviet cosmonauts closed a faulty hatch on their orbiting station during a 
3 1/2-hour spacewalk today, Soviet television said. 
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Solovyov and Alexander Balandin had been unable to close the hatch -- 
open 1/20th of an inch -- when they returned from a seven-hour walk July 18. 
</P>
<P>
Today they managed to force it shut and, once back inside, were able to 
repressurize the section and take off their spacesuits. 
</P>
<P>
The correspondent showed viewers a photograph of a broken bracket that had 
apparently caused the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Tass news agency quoted experts at Mission Control as saying it was probably 
damaged when the hatch was initially opened. Higher pressure inside the air 
lock caused the door to fly open violently, bending the bracket. 
</P>
<P>
The hatch was on Kvant-2, one of three modules attached to the Mir station. It 
was not connected to the Soyuz-TM spaceship that brought the two men to Mir in 
February, and the failure to close it apparently has not affected plans for 
their return to Earth on Aug. 9.

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that his country needs Western 
assistance to make his reform program work, and he promised that any aid will 
be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev spoke at a news conference after a day of meetings with Italian 
Premier Giulio Andreotti, the president of the European Community. Andreotti is 
a leading proponent of providing aid to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
No agreements were reached in the talks about Italian or European aid to boost 
Gorbachev's reform program. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the next two years of reforms will be crucial. 
</P>

"In these two years, in which we will have to make the most difficult changes, 
we need this kind of help," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the aid should be given quickly "to reduce the difficulty of the 
problems, and so perestroika does not slow down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the Soviet Union "cannot depend on foreign sponsors" to fix 
its economy but must depend largely on itself. Aid to his country will not be 
"a handout," he said, but temporary assistance that must be paid back. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that the Soviet Union needs help producing more food and 
consumer goods for the market and that factories need a chance to work with 
foreign firms to boost their productivity. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of Soviet inefficiency, Gorbachev has said 25% of the nation's 
crops are lost during harvesting and storage. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the Russian Federation, the Soviet Union's largest republic, 
today warned of a food shortage "catastrophe" in Russia unless efficiency 
improves. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to gather it carefully, preserve it and get it onto the table of the 
Russian people," Boris N. Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
"The existing food situation in our republic is critical," he said in an appeal 
on the front page of the Sovietskaya Rossia newspaper. "To prevent a 
catastrophe, we must improve it immediately." 
</P>
<P>
As an incentive, Yeltsin said the government will issue special coupons to 
agricultural workers, from farmers to tractor drivers, allowing them to buy 
goods that have been in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Ivan Silayev warned in a separate interview that if the 
market is not soon saturated with food and consumer goods, "the situation will 
be unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
"The prices will simply skyrocket, and the shadow economy will capture 
everything," he told Pravitelstvenny Vestnik newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The West German government has guaranteed $3.1 billion in bank loans to the 
Soviet Union, and together with France it pushed the European Community to 
endorse an immediate $15-billion aid program. 
</P>
<P>
But European leaders refused to go along with the plan, as did leaders of the 
world's seven largest capitalist powers meeting in Texas earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush says a program to provide the Soviet Union with Western advisers 
and know-how would be of greater benefit than economic aid until the Soviet 
Union makes greater changes in its economy.

REPORT OF AIDS TRANSMISSION DURING DENTAL VISIT MET WITH SKEPTICISM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the first case of its kind, federal researchers reported today that a woman 
apparently got AIDS from her dentist during a tooth pulling, even though he was 
wearing gloves and a mask. 
</P>
<P>
The case has prompted the government to review its guidelines for AIDS 
prevention during medical procedures even though "the possibility of another 
source of infection cannot be entirely excluded," the federal Centers for 
Disease Control said. 
</P>
<P>
It said all evidence was "consistent with" the patient being infected during 
her trip to the dentist. 
</P>
<P>
The dentist, who had been diagnosed three months earlier, was wearing 
protective gloves and a mask, as recommended, while extracting two molars for 
the patient, who was visiting him for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the American Dental Assn. said the CDC may have jumped to 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not happy about it," said Dr. Enid Neidle, director of scientific 
affairs for the Chicago-based ADA. "We think it is not a totally conclusive 
case of transmission. . . . We are not happy at any report that could raise 
fears on the part of the public that the dental office is a place of danger and 
infection."

U.S. BEGINS REMOVING HUGE NERVE GAS CACHE IN GERMANY

<TEXT>
<P>
A convoy of trucks today began removing a vast cache of deadly nerve gas that 
was secretly stored by the United States just outside this small West German 
town. 
</P>
<P>
The convoy took away the first batch of 100,000 gas-filled artillery shells 
stored at a U.S. military site at Clausen, which is near Kaiserslautern in the 
southwest part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The lethal cargo, destined for destruction on a Pacific atoll, is being removed 
under a 1986 U.S.-West German agreement at a cost of $83.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of crack paramilitary West German police troops lined the convoy route 
and stood guard on overpasses as the line of 80 trucks began shuttling the 
shells at about 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Vans carrying police with riot gear accompanied the convoy. 
</P>
<P>
West German authorities said that someone phoned in a bomb threat against the 
convoy but that the first shipment proceeded without incident. 
</P>
<P>
The first trucks arrived at Miesau, about 30 miles away, 2 1/2 hours later. At 
Miesau, the containers are to be loaded onto special trains that will take them 
to Nordenham on the North Sea, where they will be placed aboard U.S. Navy ships 
for transport to Johnston Atoll. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons will be destroyed in a specially built incinerator on the U.S. 
atoll about 800 miles southwest of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 20 of the 80 trucks that left Clausen actually carried the chemical 
weapons sealed in air-tight containers, said U.S. Army spokesman Jim Boyle. He 
said the rest contained decontamination crews, firefighters, West German and 
American soldiers, police, monitoring teams and medical staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The chemical team is equipped to contain any incident," he said. "The 
operation is going as planned." 
</P>
<P>
Only four protesters were spotted.

<P>
Negotiators for El Salvador and leftist guerrillas agreed today to have a U.N. 
commission monitor human rights in El Salvador, where tens of thousands of 
civilians have died in the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The accord was reached after an all-night negotiating session in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
The talks turned to the human rights issue after failing to make progress on a 
cease-fire in the decade-old war. The commission would not begin work until a 
cease-fire agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, negotiators said the rights accord was a significant step. It was 
the first concrete agreement between the sides since peace talks began in May, 
and both delegations had expressed concern that the absence of an accord in the 
San Jose talks might deal a devastating blow to the negotiating process.

Former East German Communist security chief Erich Mielke was arrested today on 
suspicion of sheltering fugitive West German guerrillas and planning internment 
camps for dissidents, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The state press agency ADN said an arrest warrant was issued after Mielke, 82, 
was determined fit to be jailed pending completion of inquiries leading to 
possible charges and a trial. 
</P>
<P>
Mielke, once top aide of former East German Stalinist leader Erich Honecker, 
was previously jailed after coming under investigation in December for 
suspected corruption, embezzlement and misrule. But he was freed later because 
of what officials said was poor health. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany last month arrested eight fugitive Red Army Faction guerrilla 
suspects who officials said had lived in the country under false names for 
years, protected by Mielke's State Security Ministry.

Authorities are trying to determine what killed a person whose body was found 
in a casket in a room equipped with an iron cage and sexual bondage 
paraphernalia, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities could not determine immediately whether the decomposed body is that 
of a male or a female, said Harris County Medical Examiner J. L. Ebdon. 
</P>
<P>
The body was found Wednesday wrapped in heavy plastic and bound at the feet 
with duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very badly decomposed but because of the wrapping, we cannot tell how 
long it has been there," Ebdon said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called by a friend of the owner to the townhouse where the body was 
found. The man found the casket while looking for tools in an upstairs room and 
opened the casket slightly after smelling a foul odor, Mayer said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors told police the home owner is hospitalized recovering from brain 
surgery.

Time is too short for a "fully settled" package covering global trading rules 
to be agreed upon by this December's deadline in the troubled Uruguay Round 
trade liberalization talks, the head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade said today. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Dunkel, GATT's director general, blamed both a lack of new instructions 
from governments to their trade negotiators and "hide-and-seek" tactics for the 
meager progress made in outstanding Uruguay Round issues. 
</P>
<P>
Dunkel, summing up a four-day meeting called to assess the status of the 
Uruguay Round, said it "may not be realistic" to expect all these issues to be 
resolved in the next 4 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
Begun in 1986, the Uruguay Round is scheduled to end Dec. 4 in Brussels, when 
trade ministers from the 105 participating countries will convene.

More than 10 Japanese securities companies are being investigated for allegedly 
compensating favored customers for 16 billion yen, or $107 million, in losses 
after the 1987 stock market crash, major Japanese newspapers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The reports, which came out in the early afternoon, had a major impact on Tokyo 
currency and stock markets, stimulating a fall in both the yen and in share 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed higher at 150.11 yen, up 0.98 yen from Wednesday's finish of 
149.13 yen. On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected 
issues lost 331.52 points, or 1.05%, closing at 31,369.75. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaichi, Daiwa Securities Co. and about 10 other brokerage firms were said to 
have compensated favored clients after the Oct. 20 crash, in which the 
benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell 14.9%, the largest daily fall on the Tokyo 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The reports were attributed to an investigation by the Tokyo Tax 
Administration.

BROADWAY: PRODUCER GIVES ACTORS' EQUITY TWO WEEKS TO DROP OPPOSITION TO

The Broadway production of the London hit "Miss Saigon" may be postponed 
because of complaints that the English star, a Caucasian, is being brought over 
to play the role of a Eurasian. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Cameron Mackintosh said Wednesday that unless Actors' Equity, the U.S. 
union, drops its opposition to lead actor Jonathan Pryce within two weeks, the 
play will be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
The union met Tuesday but failed to resolve the issue of whether Pryce, who 
plays a Eurasian brothel owner, will be permitted to perform in the American 
version of the musical. It will meet again, but the date for a new meeting has 
yet to be set. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless Equity changes its position within the next two weeks, I will have no 
choice but to withdraw the production," Mackintosh said. "This is because any 
interruption in our current production schedule would leave us with 
insufficient time to prepare this huge and complicated show for a March, 1991, 
opening." 
</P>
<P>
The earliest "Miss Saigon" could be rescheduled is autumn of 1992 because of 
"all of the other professional commitments of our creative team," Mackintosh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy arose after a complaint was filed with Equity by David Henry 
Hwang, author of "M. Butterfly," and B. D. Wong, star of the same play. They 
were critical of the casting of Pryce in the musical, which is set in Saigon 
during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Equity President Colleen Dewhurst, Wong wrote, "There is no 
doubt in my mind of the irreparable damage to my rights as an actor that would 
be wrought if . . . Asian actors are kept from bringing their unique dignity to 
the specifically Asian roles in 'Miss Saigon' and therefore to all racially 
specific roles in every future production which will look to the precedent 
'Miss Saigon' is about to set as a concrete model." 
</P>
<P>
In London, Pryce won the Olivier Award as best actor in a musical for his 
performance in "Miss Saigon." He has starred on Broadway before, winning praise 
for his performances in Trevor Griffiths' 'Comedians" in 1976 and in Dario Fo's 
"Accidental Death of an Anarchist" in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Saigon" is one of the most eagerly awaited shows of the 1990-91 Broadway 
season.

ABC News, seeking new overseas markets for its programs, said Wednesday it has 
been showing European broadcasters "Nightline" and will do the same with four 
more programs, including "World News Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The programs are being sent via satellite to cable and TV companies in 23 
countries in Western and Eastern Europe, including Rupert Murdoch's new Sky 
Television direct broadcast satellite based in London, ABC said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the European television officials have had a chance to look at ABC's 
programs, the network's executives will hold discussions with the companies 
interested in carrying them, an ABC News spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The evening newscasts of NBC and CBS and ABC's "Nightline" already are carried 
in some overseas markets, including Japan. 
</P>
<P>
However, the top-rated "World News Tonight" is not yet broadcast overseas, said 
the ABC spokesman, Scott Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
The new satellite transmission of "Nightline" to European broadcasters began on 
July 2. The other four programs will be shown during the next few months, but 
no schedule for their transmission has been set. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "World News Tonight," the programs are "This Week with David 
Brinkley," "The Health Show" and "Business World." 
</P>
<P>
ABC's move is the latest of recent efforts by all three U.S. network news 
divisions to find new markets and revenues at a time the networks are losing 
audiences to cable and other viewing alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
According to CBS, Dan Rather's "CBS Evening News" is seen in France, Italy and 
Japan. Tom Brokaw's "NBC Nightly News" is carried in Japan, New Zealand, 
Australia, Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Japan, ABC's "Nightline" is carried by broadcasters in New 
Zealand and Australia, and talks are under way to have it shown in Italy and in 
Taiwan, according to a network spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner's 24-hour Cable News Network, an early entry in the global news 
market, is seen in 90 countries.

Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who, accepted a $272,000 settlement today in 
his lawsuit against a nearby farm that he blamed for the deaths of up to 
500,000 fish at his own trout farm. 
</P>
<P>
Daltrey and his company, Beju Bop Ltd., had sued owners of The Home Farm where 
a leak of liquid fertilizer in August, 1986, entered a river and caused damage 
at Daltry's Iwerne Springs Fish Farm in Dorset in southwest England. 
</P>
<P>
Daltrey, 45, originally had sought damages of $905,000. The Home Farm had 
admitted liability but disputed the amount of damages. 
</P>
<P>
During a two-day hearing before the settlement was reached, Daltrey gave 
detailed testimony showing a surprisingly extensive knowledge of fish farming. 
He said he had been interested in trout farming since he built his own fishery 
in 1979.

Gruenberg, 65, was carrying the violin, crafted in 1731, as he checked through 
customs at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday, Sparks said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gruenberg noticed that the violin was missing from the baggage cart 
"somewhere along the way" to ground transportation, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
Thefts at the airport are common, but in this case the thief may not have 
realized the cart was carrying a Stradivarius. 
</P>
<P>
The instrument was insured for about $500,000. Also stolen was a violin worth 
$8,000 and two bows worth $3,500.

Cuba Wednesday described jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, who has defected to 
the United States, as a traitor who abandoned his country like a rat leaving a 
ship in danger. 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval decided to defect during a recent tour of Europe and has since 
traveled to the United States, the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said in a 
rare official Cuban confirmation of a defection. 
</P>
<P>
Prensa Latina quoted a statement from the state-run Cuban Institute of Music as 
saying that the trumpeter had "betrayed his country." 
</P>
<P>
"In times of danger, rats abandon the ship to drown themselves in an infinite 
sea of dishonor and shame," the statement said.

BRANDO'S HUG PUT HIM AT EASE

<TEXT>
<P>
For Matthew Broderick, working with Marlon Brando was the highlight of filming 
"The Freshman," which casts him in yet another youth role. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick recalled that he couldn't relax knowing he would meet the superstar. 
</P>
<P>
However, a big hug from Brando and his calm manner put him at ease. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a role model for everybody in the business," said Broderick. "No matter 
who they think is their role model, that person probably had Brando as a role 
model. All roads lead to Brando." 
</P>
<P>
Broderick stars in the film as a graduate student who gets hustled out of his 
possessions as soon as he arrives in New York to attend film school. 
</P>
<P>
Following and catching the thief eventually leads to a meeting with Brando's 
character -- a shady guy not unlike his Don Corleone of "The Godfather." 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 28, admitted he once was bothered by the number of teen-age roles he 
was getting. But the quality of the characters has changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I played my own age in Glory," he pointed out. "Eventually, as I age, I'll get 
more roles closer to my age."

PGA TOURNEY MAY STILL FACE PICKETS; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: PROTESTS COULD CONTINUE DESPITE SHOAL CREEK COUNTRY CLUB'S PLEDGE TO 
ADMIT BLACK MEMBERS.

<P>
The city's black mayor said today that he expects the Shoal Creek country club 
to take in black members within the next year, but that the action may not stop 
protesters from picketing the PGA Championship at the club next month. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Richard Arrington, at a news conference called after three corporations 
dropped plans to run television commercials during the tournament and a fourth 
announced it would limit its participation, said Shoal Creek members have 
"given me their commitment" that blacks will be considered for membership 
within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
Arrington said the Rev. Abraham Woods, president of the Birmingham chapter of 
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, indicated that progress made at 
Shoal Creek may not end plans by Woods to picket the PGA, which will be played 
Aug. 9-12 at the private club. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, defending the racial progress made in Birmingham over the past two 
decades, said the Shoal Creek episode is "an embarrassment to the city." He 
said country clubs all across America practice discrimination and the Shoal 
Creek case is an opportunity for Birmingham to be a leader if it can resolve 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
He said it usually takes six months for an "expedited membership" at Shoal 
Creek. Based on commitments to him from a number of Shoal Creek members, he 
said, he was confident that the club "will include blacks within the next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines said today that it would limit its participation in TV 
advertising for the tournament. Bill Berry, a spokesman for Delta, told USA 
Today that "there may be some Delta presence" in the tournament because of 
contractual obligations. "This is one of those embarrassments we have no 
control over." 
</P>
<P>
Toyota and Anheuser-Busch on Wednesday joined IBM in canceling plans to run 
commercials during the ABC and ESPN telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
Shoal Creek club founder Hall Thompson angered many when he was quoted in a 
newspaper story as saying the club could not be pressured into accepting 
blacks. He later apologized and said he was quoted out of context.

Don Mattingly, bothered by a sore back all season, may be out for the rest of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly's hellish season took yet another turn for the worse Wednesday, when 
the pain in his lower back intensified to the point that he went into Stump 
Merrill's office and told him that he could not play in Nolan Ryan's try for 
win No. 300. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly insisted on watching Ryan from the dugout, but Merrill said the 
six-time All-Star probably will travel to New York for further tests rather 
than accompany the club to Cleveland. Merrill cringed at the thought of losing 
Mattingly for a long time, but he said he knows that is a real possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the rest of Mattingly's season is in jeopardy, Merrill paused several 
seconds before saying: "Hopefully not, but I wouldn't rule it out. He's the 
last who ever would agree to that type of thing. We do one thing with him: We 
don't play him until he's 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly, who has a history of back trouble, experienced lower back spasms for 
the first time this year on July 2 in Kansas City.

MONTANA CLOSE TO SIGNING NFL'S BIGGEST CONTRACT: $13 MILLION

<P>
Joe Montana indicated he may be close to agreeing to the highest contract in 
the NFL, a deal that reportedly would bring the San Francisco 49ers quarterback 
$13 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
Montana's contract was one of several that dominated the opening of the 49ers' 
training camp Wednesday at Sierra College here. 
</P>
<P>
He was typically nonchalant about his contract as he emerged from the first 
team meal at camp. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not finalized," he said of the proposed deal, believed to pay him $4 
million this season and decrease by $500,000 each of the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
If the figures are correct, Montana's new contract, averaging $3.25 million 
annually, would surpass the paychecks of the two quarterbacks who now top the 
league. Jim Kelly of Buffalo and Randall Cunningham of Philadelphia average 
slightly more than $3 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, who turned 34 in June, signed a contract extension in 1988 that would 
have earned him $2.5 million this season. But after he led the 49ers to their 
fourth Super Bowl victory in January, owner Ed DeBartolo Jr. hinted that he 
would redo Montana's contract. 
</P>
<P>
Montana said he would like to have the contract formalized before the season 
starts.

BASEBALL: ROSEANNE BARR SPIT ON THE GROUND AFTER FANS BOOED HER SHRILL 
RENDITION OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

<P>
Roseanne Barr made an obscene gesture and spit on the ground after she was 
booed at a San Diego Padres game for a shrill rendition of the national anthem 
in front of 30,000 baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
The comedienne and star of ABC's "Roseanne" appeared to struggle Wednesday 
night with an echo from the sound system as she sang between games of a 
doubleheader with the Cincinnati Reds, said Ron Seaver, the Padres' promotions 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Barr plugged her ears with her fingers at the start of the song, then sang in a 
shrill voice. After the boos began, Barr reached toward her crotch and spit on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Barr's husband, Tom Arnold, later made a ceremonial pitch with no reaction, but 
Barr got more boos as she waved to the crowd and left with him. 
</P>
<P>
"The Padres understand that many people were concerned about Roseanne Barr's 
rendition of the national anthem," Seaver said. "She was doing the best she 
could under the circumstances of the audio delay and she certainly meant no 
disrespect to the national anthem." 
</P>
<P>
Barr said she was pleased with her performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I did great and people wanted more," she told a reporter for KFMB-TV 
before leaving the field. Asked about the boos, she said, "Yeah, well, just 
because they weren't up front." 
</P>
<P>
At least two Padres players were upset by her singing, spitting and gesturing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was embarrassed as a person and I was embarrassed for them (the Padres)," 
said Padres pitcher Eric Show, who was on the field. "I can't believe it 
happened. It's an insult. There are people who died for that song." 
</P>
<P>
Said Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn: "I thought it was a disgrace. When they said 
she was going to sing the national anthem I thought something like this was 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press called Barr's publicist in Los Angeles on Wednesday and 
left a message requesting comment. The call was not immediately returned.

Ron Hansen , the leading rider in Northern California the past year, will ride 
regularly at the Del Mar meet, agent Wayne Macdonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen was the leading rider at the Golden Gate Fields meet that ended in June. 
</P>
<P>
He also led the standings at Bay Meadows last winter 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to grind it out," MacDonald said. "I'm working on the whole meet."

<P>
Sunny Blossom, who has already won 6-furlong stakes at Santa Anita, Aqueduct 
and Golden Gate Fields this year, will try to add Del Mar to his list when he 
carries high weight of 121 pounds in the $100,000-added Grade III Bing Crosby 
Handicap on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Blossom, a 5-year-old gelding, has won nine of 27 starts and earned 
$430,255. 
</P>
<P>
A field of five to eight is shaping up. Considered definite are Sunny Blossom, 
Gary Stevens, 121; Sam Who, Julio Garcia, 119; Frost Free, Pat Valenzuela, 116; 
Cresting Water, Kent Desormeaux, 113; and Sensational Star, Rafael Meza, 113. 
Other Possibilities include Timeless Answer (116), Burnt Hills (112) and Top 
Cash (109).

CLOSED-DOOR TALKS ON HIALEAH'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL MORAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of the Miami area's three race tracks met privately Wednesday 
to determine the fate of Hialeah Park. 
</P>
<P>
Gulfstream and Calder, both owned by Bertram Firestone, are in position to 
squeeze Hialeah out of the South Florida scheme since racing dates are now 
unregulated in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
That was evident last season, when Hialeah was forced to close when unable to 
carry out its meeting in competition with Calder and Gulfstream, which control 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
Many prominent horsemen support an effort to save Hialeah, however, even though 
its owner, John J. Brunetti, still makes demands for a lengthy, unopposed 
winter meeting. He is unlikely to be granted such a request. 
</P>
<P>
"I will have no comment, and it is my understanding that no one who attended 
will have one either," Gulfstream President Doug Donn said after the meeting. 
Neither Firestone nor Brunetti attended. 
</P>
<P>
The tracks have until Tuesday to arrive at dates for next year's schedule or 
elect, by not doing so, to oppose one another again. It is doubtful Hialeah 
would attempt to open again under such circumstances.

MAX VENABLE RETURNS TO HIS FIELD OF DREAMS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THE ANGEL LEFT FIELDER CAME BACK AFTER A FULL YEAR AWAY FROM THE 
GAME, AND BUCKING THE ODDS, HE'S PLAYING BETTER THAN EVER.

<P>
Two years ago, Max Venable made what seemed to be a wise decision. He quit 
playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles helped him reach that decision, releasing Venable at the 
conclusion of spring training. At age 30, he reluctantly accepted his lot and 
took a job working construction in Marin County. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Venable made what seemed to be an unwise decision. After sitting out 
the entire 1988 season, he signed a contract with the Angels. So rather than 
spend more time at home with his wife and three young children, he spent the 
spring playing baseball in Triple A Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
For players such as Max Venable, professional baseball is a numbing succession 
of trips back and forth between the majors and the minors. At some point, a 
player decides enough is enough. Venable reached that point, then changed his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids dream of playing in the big leagues," Venable said. "It's hard to pull 
away from a game you've played most of your life." 
</P>
<P>
But Venable's dreams often are fragmented, and so it was last year when the 
Angels called him up in July. Venable collected 10 hits in 20 at-bats and was 
promptly issued a return ticket to Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, nothing had changed. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year. 
</P>
<P>
Venable has spent all or part -- mostly part -- of 11 professional seasons in 
the big leagues. But never has he done anything even remotely comparable to 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
He is batting .304, more than 60 points above his career average. He is playing 
good defense in left field, as he showed Tuesday night here against the A's 
when he threw out Jose Canseco and Ozzie Canseco at second base in separate 
innings. A left-handed hitter who platoons with Dante Bichette, Venable will 
almost certainly avoid banishment to Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Having completed his stretching exercises at the Oakland Coliseum before 
Wednesday's 13-3 loss to the A's, the loudspeaker blaring that old Doors 
classic "Break on Through," Venable was asked to describe how it must feel to 
have this sort of success after all he has been through. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one of those years when things go right," he said. "I have a manager 
who believes in me. You could say I'm finally in the right place at the right 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Angels Manager Doug Rader has little to smile about these days, his team 
languishing in fifth place, 15 1/2 games behind the A's. But the mention of 
Venable's name lights up his weary face. 
</P>
<P>
"I admire him a tremendous amount," Rader said. "He's got a very strong 
character. That's almost unheard of, sitting out a year at his age and then 
coming back. But he has done everything he could possibly do to get to this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way it has always been, ever since Venable signed with the Dodgers 
in 1976 after initially accepting a football scholarship from the University of 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
This is his fourth port of call in the majors. Just twice -- in 1983 with the 
San Francisco Giants and in 1986 with the Cincinnati Reds -- has Venable lasted 
an entire season in the bigs. He is making $250,000 this year with the Angels, 
with possibly even richer prospects for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"If I finish out well, I don't know, it might get me another year or two," 
Venable said. "But I do know I want to stay in baseball in some capacity. It's 
a game I won't be able to pull away from until the day I die."

MAKING A NAME;

DISC.

Like everyone everywhere else, John Doe wanted to move to California. 
</P>
<P>
He did. On Halloween in 1976, he moved from Baltimore to Los Angeles. Then, 
like half the people in L.A., Doe wanted to start a band. In the late '70s with 
Exene Cervenka and Billy Zoom, Doe formed X. 
</P>
<P>
Seven albums later, Doe, like everyone in L.A., wanted to move to Ventura 
County. He did that too. He lives in the boonies, out near Frazier Park and 
close to a Boy Scout camp -- big trees, 5,000 feet high, snow in the winter, no 
cable television, no satellite dish. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding his horizons, Doe recently has been in several movies, such as "Great 
Balls of Fire," "Salvador," "Slamdance" and Sandra Bernhard's "Without You I'm 
Nothing." Busy, busy, busy, bassist Doe just finished working on Mojo Nixon's 
latest album, which includes the memorable "Don Henley Must Die" and "Destroy 
All Lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
Doe just released his debut solo disc titled -- what else -- "Meet John Doe," 
featuring lots of "relationship" songs and no members of X. On guitar, Doe has 
Jon Dee Graham from the True Believers and the legendary Richard Lloyd from 
Television. Doe's band will be at The Carnaval Club in Santa Barbara on 
Tuesday, July 31. He had this to say in a recent interview: 
</P>
<P>
How's the album doing? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's not going through the roof, but it's not going down the toilet, 
either. Actually, it's getting a lot of exposure on college radio and 
alternative radio and from people in-the-know. 
</P>
<P>
How is the album different from an X album? 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, I did more stuff myself. I didn't have the band to look to and 
ask, 'Is this a good idea?' or 'Is this a bad idea?' I relied more on the 
producer as a sounding board. Also, I could do more personal songs without 
having to reflect a group attitude. And I used two guitarists. I've worked with 
Jon Dee Graham before. As far as Richard Lloyd, someone suggested him and I 
thought 'That's a great idea, why didn't I think of that?' 
</P>
<P>
Was J. Geils right, does love stink? 
</P>
<P>
No, love is everything. 
</P>
<P>
Describe John Doe music. 
</P>
<P>
It's right there in my bio. I'm somewhere between the honky-tonk and the art 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
How did you get involved in the music biz? 
</P>
<P>
I always wanted to be a musician as a kid. It sounded like a good job -- get on 
the Ed Sullivan show, travel around. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, you've seen the movie "Meet John Doe." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, I have it on tape. 
</P>
<P>
Will X live again? 
</P>
<P>
Oh yes, we hope so; maybe next year. We just sort of let X expire. We put in 
our time at Elektra, seven years' worth. The live album from '88 was our last 
one -- we did seven albums in the '80s and we played a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Why aren't people like John Hiatt or bands like The Blasters rich? 
</P>
<P>
Tell me and I'll be rich. Actually, John Hiatt probably is rich -- a lot of 
people are doing his songs. As for The Blasters, part of it is sticking to it 
and striking it big from the beginning. It was the same with X -- we did well, 
but not that well. We were on the verge of having that big hit for six or seven 
years. Whether or not it's your fault, I don't know. But then you start reading 
all this stuff and then you begin to wonder, what are we doing wrong? It's 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Who are some of the bands you like? 
</P>
<P>
Let's see, I like a band from back east, The Titanics, also The Tragically Hip, 
The Black Crowes, The Replacements, Thelonious Monster. 
</P>
<P>
What's the difference between music and acting? 
</P>
<P>
One's internal, one's external. Music is external. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: The Carnaval Club is located at 634 State St., 962-9991. 
Tickets are $9. They are available through Ticketmaster or at the door. Doors 
open at 9 p.m.

A LITTLE HELP; 
</P>
<P>
A GRATEFUL JOE COCKER IS PLANNING A CONCERT TO BENEFIT HIS NEIGHBORS, VICTIMS 
OF LAST MONTH'S FIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Cocker knows all about hard luck. So when his neighbors lost their homes, 
possessions and peace of mind to the Painted Cave Fire of a month ago -- the 
worst in Santa Barbara's history -- Cocker was eager to plan a benefit concert. 
</P>
<P>
Even with hits such as "When the Night Comes" and "Up Where We Belong," many 
still remember Cocker from his Woodstock and "Mad Dogs and Englishmen" days. In 
an era that gave the world Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin -- and 
then took them away -- Cocker is a survivor. 
</P>
<P>
Years of drug and alcohol abuse almost robbed him of his health and marked him 
with record companies as a high risk. And Cocker's bluesy renditions and 
gravelly voice, accompanied by his characteristic contorted movements, weren't 
in vogue during the disco decade. 
</P>
<P>
And by not taking care of his own financial interests he lost most of his 
earlier earnings. Without money or a job, it took Cocker most of the 1970s to 
get back on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979 he escaped Los Angeles, and the alcohol and drugs, to live on a 
mountaintop in Santa Barbara. Now, in his mid-40s, Cocker can claim a string of 
hits through the 1980s. He spends his time singing, as well as trout fishing 
with buddies, and staying at home playing backgammon with Pam Cocker, his wife 
of three years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just the typical homebody couple; people are surprised at how boring we 
are," Pam Cocker said. "Last year Joe toured for seven and a half months, so 
when we get the chance, we absolutely love to just kick back at home." 
</P>
<P>
For a short time last month, Cocker thought his mountaintop haven had been 
destroyed in the Painted Cave Fire, which demolished more than 4,500 acres and 
600 residences. 
</P>
<P>
"I was performing in Pittsburgh, and I didn't even know about the fire until 
the next day," said Cocker who is touring the United States and Canada. The 
newly added benefit concert at the Santa Barbara County Bowl at 7 p.m. Tuesday 
is the last stop of his two-month tour. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 6 in the morning when I saw the reports of the fire on the television," 
Cocker said. "I could recognize the mountains, and I thought that our home must 
have burnt down. I was prepared for the worst." 
</P>
<P>
But miraculously, the fire stopped just 50 yards from the front door. 
</P>
<P>
"What worried me was that our three cats and two pigs were at home alone," Pam 
Cocker said. "I asked a friend, if it came to it, to shoot the pigs rather than 
have them die in the fire." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Rita and Earl, the thousand-pound porkers, slept through it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
Grateful for their own good luck, the Cockers, along with manager Michael Lang 
and friend Bill Garlock, manager of the Oxnard Strawberry Festival, came up 
with the idea for a benefit concert. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of my neighbors and friends, people I have known for years, have been 
hurt by this tragedy," Cocker said. "Some of them risked their lives fighting 
the fire, and I want to return something to them. . . . If I can do that with 
my music, I will." 
</P>
<P>
When singer Pat Benatar learned of the concert through a mutual business 
acquaintance, she offered her help as well. 
</P>
<P>
"She and her band, and Joe and the band, and all the roadies and drivers -- 
everyone -- is helping out for free," said Pam Cocker, chairwoman of a 
committee to disburse the money raised by the concert. "And we have use of the 
County Bowl for free, and we've gotten free publicity and free printing, free 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never done a benefit before where everyone was so willing to give all 
they can," added Pam Cocker, a veteran of political fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
She hopes that the concert will raise about $100,000, and that the reception 
after the show, which will be attended by both singers, the bands and a number 
of other celebrities, will pull in another few thousand. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the reception are $25 and are available at Gary Paul clothing 
store, Compact Disc and Tape Stores in Santa Barbara and Goleta, the Santa 
Barbara Athletic Club and Distinctions Hair Salon. Tickets for the show are 
$25.50, $23.50 and $19.50 and are available at the box office and at 
Ticketmaster outlets. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake of 1925, World War II and a serious drought in 1948 were the 
only three disasters to interrupt Santa Barbara's biggest annual event, Old 
Spanish Days. 
</P>
<P>
But neither the severe drought conditions nor the devastating Painted Cave Fire 
will interfere with this year's festival. Better known as "Fiesta," the 
celebration will take place Aug. 1 through 5 throughout Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
To the cultured, Fiesta is a tribute to the city's Spanish and Mexican 
heritage. To the business-minded, Fiesta is a way to get tourists into town. 
And to the masses, Fiesta is a five-day party. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the array of wine, music and dance, Fiesta features a large selection 
of organized events. These include a parade down State and Cabrillo streets at 
1 p.m. Friday, a children's parade at 10 a.m. Saturday, a rodeo and horse show 
at 8 p.m. Thursday and Friday and outdoor markets, food and entertainment, 
including Gypsy flamenco music and dance. 
</P>
<P>
For information about the festival and dates and times and prices of individual 
events, call (805) 962-8101. 
</P>
<P>
While most of Santa Barbara celebrates the city's Hispanic legacy, Oak Park 
will be the site of the 17th annual Greek Festival. Bouzouki music, authentic 
dances and moussaka, baklava and ouzo can all be found there from 11 a.m. to 7 
p.m. Saturday and Sunday. At 3:30 Sunday, George Alexiades, somewhat of a local 
legend, will perform his famous "table dance" in which he takes the corner of a 
dinner table in his teeth, lifts it -- no hands allowed -- then spins it around 
in time to the music. 
</P>
<P>
And for those interested in Chinese culture, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art 
will open its exhibit, "From Inside the Great Wall: Recent Acquisitions of 
Chinese Costumes and Textiles," on Saturday. Featured among the very rare 
costumes, accessories and furnishings is a sampling of court costumes from the 
Qing Dynasty (1644-1912). 
</P>
<P>
Even more rare than Chinese costumes and textiles is an appearance by Grammy 
award-winning musician Wynton Marsalis at a small venue. "We wanted more of a 
New Orleans club, speak-easy-type atmosphere where it's more intimate and 
people don't have to sit glued to their seats," said Dawn Elder of Crossroads 
Entertainment. The 25-year-old jazz trumpet player, who has won Grammy awards 
in both the jazz and classical categories, will perform at the Longbar, 111 
State St., at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, (805) 564-1215. Tickets are $16.50, 
$20 at the door. General admission and dinner patrons are admitted first. MAJA

LINEMAN ERIC BANDUCCI IS LATEST IN A FAMILY OF BLOCKBUSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three generations of Banduccis have put their shoulders to the blocking sled as 
football linemen. Though they keep injuring their shoulders by blocking and 
tackling, they have kept on playing -- and playing well. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the line was the late Bruno Banducci, who played with legendary 
quarterback Frankie Albert on Stanford's 1941 Rose Bowl champions. He played a 
couple of years with the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL and later blocked for 
Albert with the San Francisco 49ers in the early years of the All-America 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno's son, Russ, also played for a Rose Bowl winner. He blocked for another 
star quarterback, Garry Beban, when Coach Tommy Prothro's "gutty, little 
Bruins" upset powerful Michigan State, 14-12, at Pasadena in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
The latest Banducci to carry on the family tradition is Russ' son, Eric, who 
starred as an offensive and defensive lineman at Santa Monica High. He hopes to 
emulate his father and grandfather by playing for at least one Rose Bowl winner 
after he enrolls at UCLA this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Eric will emulate his father when he plays in the 39th Shrine All-Star Football 
Game Saturday in the Rose Bowl. Russ played in the 1962 Shrine game. 
</P>
<P>
But Eric hopes the Banducci tradition of dislocating shoulders on the football 
field came to an end when he suffered such an injury as a sophomore lineman on 
the Santa Monica varsity. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Banducci said shoulder injuries are "a family trait. My father had three 
operations for dislocations and had scars you wouldn't believe; they were an 
inch-and-a-half wide. I dislocated my shoulder at Menlo Atherton High School." 
</P>
<P>
Eric, The Times Westside prep lineman of the year in 1989, said he hurt his 
right shoulder when he collided with a couple of opposing linemen in his team's 
first league game of his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
Although surgery was prescribed, he missed only one game that year, electing to 
have an operation at the end of the season. He continued to play both offense 
and defense with his shoulder in a harness. He learned to center the ball with 
his left arm because his right arm and shoulder were tightly strapped and 
immobile. 
</P>
<P>
His days as a center will be over if he makes his mark at UCLA at defensive 
guard, the position that the Bruin coaches want him to play. He said that he 
has always preferred defense to offense and was able to show UCLA Coach Terry 
Donahue and his staff that he can play defense when he attended Donahue's 
summer camp after his junior year in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"My real love is defense," he said. "It fits my temperament and attitude. In 
the first half of (Donahue's) camp I played offensive line, and in the second 
half I played defensive line. They really liked what they saw." 
</P>
<P>
Liked it well enough to offer a scholarship to Banducci as a defensive guard, 
which he quickly accepted. 
</P>
<P>
He had narrowed down his list of schools to those in the Pacific 10 Conference, 
but his first choice was always UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Both my parents went to UCLA, and I was raised on UCLA football," he said. "My 
mom (Sandy) and dad didn't push me, though. I loved UCLA and wanted to play for 
the Bruins." 
</P>
<P>
Banducci made an oral commitment to UCLA in December, long before the period in 
which football players are allowed to sign national letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Banducci said that he thinks his son "was almost dangerously set on UCLA. 
It's been his goal for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he took Eric on trips to the universities of Oregon and Washington 
in an attempt to "expand his horizons," but that his mind wasn't changed by 
scholarship offers from those schools. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Banducci said that he doesn't think that Donahue was influenced to give 
Eric a scholarship because he and Donahue were teammates at UCLA and roomed 
together briefly. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't help, believe me," he said. "UCLA is all business in its 
recruiting." 
</P>
<P>
Eric said that the relationship between his father and Donahue "didn't have any 
impact on the situation at all. (In a UCLA dormitory), he just happened to get 
stuck with my dad -- unfortunately for him." 
</P>
<P>
He is eager to take on college offensive linemen and ballcarriers when he plays 
defense for the Bruins. "Defense gives me an advantage; I can hit rather than 
be hit," he said. "I feel a higher intensity when I'm on defense; I can use 
more of my natural ability." 
</P>
<P>
He was the leading tackler on the Santa Monica defensive line last season, with 
42. He also had six quarterback sacks and two fumble recoveries. He was Santa 
Monica Coach Tebb Kusserow's top nomination for The Times All-Westside prep 
football team, and Kusserow said that Banducci was "an excellent blocker (with) 
great strength and quickness." 
</P>
<P>
Kusserow said he thinks that Eric "certainly has the mental attitude to play 
defense; you sort of have to get yourself motivated to be a defensive lineman. 
I would not be surprised if he gave a good showing of himself at UCLA. On 
defense you can be a little bit more reckless; you don't have to be quite as 
precise as on offense. The younger player can play more and sooner on defense 
than on offense." 
</P>
<P>
Eric said he thinks he acquired the tools necessary to play defense when he got 
involved as a youngster in a wrestling program run by the late Fred Jackson, 
whose sons Lawrence and Greg won several CIF-Southern Section wrestling 
championships when they competed for Santa Monica. Lawrence also won three 
state wrestling titles. 
</P>
<P>
Wrestling, he said, "gave me the athletic skills for the defensive side: 
balance, body control and strength. Wrestling teaches you what comes naturally, 
and a lot of defense is second nature. When you don't have to think on the 
football field, that's when you know you've got it right." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he is eager to play in the Shrine game, not only because he will 
be associating with the best performers in California but also because of the 
opportunity to see the crippled children whom the game benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in the game, he said, will be "a big challenge. It will be a lot of 
fun, and I'll be able to challenge myself at the same time. I can't wait. It 
will be the experience of a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
"It will also be great because you get to visit the children in the hospital. 
I'm really looking forward to it."

'MR. TRANSFER' SAYS HE'S FOUND A HOME IN BERKELEY; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: PERRY KLEIN, COMING OFF A REDSHIRT SEASON, IS READY TO CHALLENGE FOR 
CAL QUARTERBACK JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Don't talk about changing schools to Perry Klein these days. He won't hear of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The peripatetic Klein, who earned the nickname "Mr. Transfer" while playing 
quarterback for several Southland high schools, claims he has found a permanent 
home at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm there (at Cal) for the duration," Klein said last week from his family's 
Malibu home. "There will be no more transferring. I like it there and am very 
committed to helping turn the football program around." 
</P>
<P>
Klein is battling for the starting quarterback job, which makes his decision to 
return to Cal an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
He was a redshirt as a freshman, and the lack of playing time led him to 
thoughts of changing schools. But the arrival of spring ball found Klein 
engaged in a battle for starting duties with junior Mike Pawlawski. 
</P>
<P>
With his interest renewed, Mr. Transfer seems content to stay put. At least for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there was a time last year when Perry was feeling a little low," Cal 
offensive coordinator Steve Mariucci said. "Then he found a role on the scout 
team and he was a new man. Perry came in with high expectations, but he just 
had to learn to be patient. There's a lot to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, though, Perry has a very bright future here. His picture 
eventually will hang alongside all of the other great quarterbacks that have 
played here. I have no doubt about that." 
</P>
<P>
Although blessed with much natural talent, Klein has never been a patient 
player. His much-publicized prep career led him through a maze of transfers 
starting at Santa Monica High, then to Palisades, on to Carson and finally back 
to Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Klein led Palisades to the City 3-A Division final his junior year, then helped 
guide Carson to the 4-A championship as a senior in 1988. What he did off the 
field, however, is what grabbed most of the headlines. The press hounded him 
and his parents, Danny and Diana Klein, through most of his senior season, 
questioning his transfer habits. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the negative press really never bothered us because we knew what we 
were doing," Diana Klein said. "There were some tense moments, of course. One 
time a Channel 4 helicopter was flying over our house in Malibu because they 
thought we were supposed to be living in Carson. But my husband and I always 
just supported what Perry wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Klein attended Palisades as a sophomore and a junior. Since the Dolphins 
weren't returning many starters for Klein's senior season, he decided to 
transfer to Carson, which annually fields one of the best teams in the City 
Section. His parents rented a house in the area, and maintained their Malibu 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
The move from Palisades to Carson sparked many hard feelings. Palisades Coach 
Jack Epstein said the Klein family abused the transfer rule and made a mockery 
of the system. Students and football players at Carson called Klein a rich, 
spoiled white kid. 
</P>
<P>
Klein eventually earned a place on the team and made friends. He earned a 
scholarship to Cal, making his transfer seem worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't have regrets about what I did," Klein said. "I left Palisades to 
make me a better player, and I accomplished that. You have to look out for 
yourself in this world. I just wanted to improve my game. 
</P>
<P>
"My only regret is that I didn't stay at Carson." 
</P>
<P>
After his senior football season, Klein transferred to play volleyball at Santa 
Monica, where he graduated. When he was chosen as a replacement player for last 
summer's Shrine Game, there was a joke about which school Klein would 
represent. He chose Carson. 
</P>
<P>
The negative publicity didn't end when Klein graduated. The San Francisco 
Chronicle's sports section ran a front-page story on Klein's school-hopping 
habits the day he arrived for fall practice at Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I thought I could put that all behind me at Cal, and now everybody on the 
team knew who I was and all about my past," Klein said. "A lot of guys were 
saying, 'Who is this guy coming in here and stealing the headlines already?' 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, I don't like being called Mr. Transfer. I find it annoying. A lot 
of the people who write about me don't really know the whole story. I guess 
since most people haven't seen me play at Cal, they can only write about my 
past. I figure once I start playing, they'll forget about my transfers and 
write about me as a player." 
</P>
<P>
Saddled with a back injury suffered while playing volleyball over the summer 
and sidelined by the incumbency of Troy Taylor, he was redshirted, then played 
on the scout team the second half of the season. He impressed the coaches with 
his strong arm and quickness. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what role you give Perry, he goes all out," Mariucci said. "Believe 
me, he is no prima donna. Perry is a very confident young man, but he works as 
hard or harder than almost anyone else on the team. He expects to be in there 
competing for a starting job all of the time, and he'll stop at nothing to get 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Klein also was introduced to the weight room. He admitted he never lifted a 
weight in high school, which may explain why he was 6-foot-3 and only 170 
pounds when he arrived at Cal. He is now 6-3 1/2 and 195 and bench-presses 245 
pounds, almost 50 pounds more than a year ago. "I haven't lost any of my speed, 
but now I can take those hits a little better," he said.

Klein, though leaving high school with a 3.3 grade-point average, found college 
difficult early on. He failed his first midterms in three classes, which added 
to his depression over not playing football. He regrouped and finished with a 
2.2 GPA, which he improved to 2.4 last semester despite a course load that 
included classes in nuclear technology and physics. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned the importance of academics," Klein said. "I breezed through all 
of my classes in high school, but I can't do that here. Getting my degree will 
require as much work or more than earning a starting job on the football team. 
</P>
<P>
I know that it's important to have a degree to fall back on since you never 
know when your football career will end." 
</P>
<P>
Although home for the summer, Klein hasn't slowed his pace. He is working out 
six days a week, following a strict regimen of exercise. He regularly throws 
the ball, runs three miles on the beach and lifts weights. He recently began 
working out with USC quarterback Todd Marinovich, a close friend. And he's also 
enrolled in a math class at Christ College in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Klein admits he still has a lot to learn about Cal's offensive system, but 
fully expects to be starting in the team's opener Sept. 8 at Wisconsin. 
Mariucci said Klein has already beaten out sophomore Mike Beebe and shares the 
depth chart's top spot with Pawlawski. Pawlawski played backup to Taylor last 
year, but saw limited action and has little varsity experience. 
</P>
<P>
Klein's commitment to earning the starting job has meant a temporary end to a 
promising volleyball career. A prep All-American, he had to bypass the 
volleyball season this spring to concentrate on football. He said he hopes to 
start up again after he establishes his role on the football team. 
</P>
<P>
Cal finished a disappointing 4-7 last year, 2-6 and last place in the Pac-10. 
Since Klein prefers playing for winning programs, some may wonder how he will 
adjust to the possibility of leading a losing team. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what I was getting into when I decided to come here," Klein said. "But 
building a winner is what excited me most about this place. When people ask me 
how it feels to be on a losing team I tell them they don't know what they're 
talking about. 
</P>
<P>
"I was part of a rebuilding team at Palisades and that's why I came here. I 
like that challenge. I think we'll be very good in a couple of years. It may 
not happen until I graduate, but if I can have a hand in the rebuilding process 
that will make me happy."

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: MOTORCYCLE-GANG ROMANCE MAKES NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suzanne Forster's new romance novel, "The Devil and Ms. Moody," was not an easy 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
When the Newport Beach author submitted a proposal for the novel in the 
mid-'80s, her publisher at the time was intrigued with her story but considered 
the subject matter -- a motorcycle gang -- too risky for a romance novel. 
</P>
<P>
"The Devil and Ms. Moody" (Bantam Loveswept) has proved to be a successful 
exception to the dictum that romance novels must avoid dealing with "grim, 
gritty and unpleasant reality." 
</P>
<P>
As Forster says: "I'm happy to say ('The Devil and Ms. Moody') has plenty of 
all three. It's also funny, a little raunchy . . . steamy enough to fog reading 
glasses." 
</P>
<P>
The romance novel, Forster's ninth since 1985, earned a rare five-star rating 
from Romantic Times, the first time in two years the trade magazine's reviewer 
has awarded five stars. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out with a big arrangement of flowers on my front porch from my 
editor," Forster said. "It was a real surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Forster's heroine, as she explains, is Edwina Moody, "a straight-arrow 
investigator who traces heirs. Her assignment is to track down the missing heir 
to a fortune, who has joined a motorcycle gang in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
The novel's hero is Diablo, "a rogue biker -- your basic outlaw in black 
leather -- who has his own reasons for wanting to join the Warlords. Despite an 
instinctive mistrust of each other, (Edwina and Diablo) form an alliance that 
results in a lot of spine-tingling complications, not the least of which is a 
powerful physical attraction." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Romantic Times bestowed the magazine's WISH Award on the roguish 
Diablo. (WISH stands for Women in Search of a Hero.) 
</P>
<P>
Forster said she has always been fascinated by the counterculture world of 
motorcycle gangs. 
</P>
<P>
As she sees it, "bikers are the closest thing we have to the primitive warrior 
of ancient times. Bikers tend to be rugged individualists who break from 
tradition regularly. They're mavericks by nature, and if we can believe their 
public image, they're often physically aggressive and sometimes even violent. 
Those very traits, greatly valued in ancient war-faring cultures, are not 
valued in our 'civilized' society today." 
</P>
<P>
It's ironic, she added, "that bikers are often branded rebels and outcasts for 
the very instincts that were once considered noble." 
</P>
<P>
Forster began writing in 1980 after being injured in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
At the time she was a graduate student in clinical psychology. To pass time 
while she was recuperating, her husband, Allan, jury-rigged a portable keyboard 
for her computer so she could write in bed. 
</P>
<P>
"I started with a personal journal," she recalled. "I never intended to be a 
writer." 
</P>
<P>
Although she and her husband, an aerospace engineer and consulting attorney, 
have written unproduced screenplays together, Forster is devoting full time to 
writing romances -- two to three a year. 
</P>
<P>
This year has turned out to be the most memorable in Forster's writing career. 
</P>
<P>
In March, her eighth book, "Wild Child," hit No. 2 on Waldenbooks' romance 
bestseller list. That was her first bestseller and was, she says, "cause for 
considerable celebration in the Forster household." 
</P>
<P>
Forster said she enjoyed writing "The Devil and Ms. Moody" more than any of her 
other novels. 
</P>
<P>
"It got a little dangerous along the way. Not truly danger, but it was 
certainly a little more risky than my other books. I went to biker bars and 
spent a day at a biker rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing my husband and I did at the rodeo was buy a black Harley 
T-shirt. We just mixed and mingled. . . . I told them I was doing a story 
without going into a lot of detail. We had a great time and . . . and they were 
tremendously helpful and very cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
With a laugh, she added: "I heard stories I couldn't use -- a lot of stories."

</P>
<P>
CRIME: AN EX-COP, CONVICTED OF MURDER 13 YEARS AGO, SAYS THE SYSTEM BETRAYED 
HIM. A JUDGE IS ASKED TO OVERTURN THE VERDICT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Behind the towering walls of the Correctional Training Facility in Soledad, 
ex-policeman Billy Joe McIlvain sits alone in an 8-by-10-foot cell, convinced 
that he was betrayed by the system he once served. 
</P>
<P>
To those who put him there, he is still "Crazy Hutch," an overzealous cop with 
All-American looks who got what he deserved -- a life sentence -- for abducting 
and brutally executing a teen-age gang member in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
But to family, friends and a growing cadre of supporters, McIlvain was the 
victim, a dedicated San Gabriel officer who defended himself against a ruthless 
street gang at a time when the small suburban town closed its eyes to such 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, prosecutors and the slain youth's mother travel 300 miles up the 
California coast to parole hearings to ensure that McIlvain, 45, remains behind 
bars. At the same time, he is on the White House Christmas card list, the 
National Assn. of Chiefs of Police insists he is innocent and actor David Soul 
-- who played McIlvain's hero in the 1970s TV series "Starsky and Hutch" -- has 
become a confidant. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 13 years after the killing, the McIlvain murder case is back in Los 
Angeles Superior Court, where a judge is being asked to overturn his conviction 
based on a number of alleged discrepancies in the original trial. 
</P>
<P>
At the core of his appeal, filed last week, is McIlvain's contention that 
jailhouse informants lied about him to win leniency for themselves. It is a 
practice detailed in a recent Los Angeles County grand jury report, which 
sharply criticized the district attorney's office and the Sheriff's Department 
for tolerating suspected perjury from snitches and rewarding them for their 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"They have one of the strongest cases compelling a new trial," said Gigi 
Gordon, an attorney who investigated the abuse of jailhouse informants for the 
Los Angeles Criminal Courts Bar Assn. "These are some very, very serious 
allegations." 
</P>
<P>
The authorities who put together the case against McIlvain, however, deny that 
informants provided fabricated testimony or that any deals were cut. 
</P>
<P>
More important, they say, the testimony of dozens of other witnesses provided 
overwhelming proof of McIlvain's guilt -- that he kidnaped 18-year-old David 
Dominguez, blasted him repeatedly with a .12-gauge shotgun, then tried to make 
it appear as if the youth had abducted him. 
</P>
<P>
"We had him nailed," said retired West Covina Police Detective John Forrester, 
who arrested McIlvain and now works for an insurance firm in the San Fernando 
Valley. "This was a cold-blooded, calculated killing. Somewhere along the way, 
Billy Joe lost the calling." 
</P>
<P>
The story that emerges from dozens of interviews and a review of hundreds of 
pages of court documents is a disturbing tale of contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
Was the blond, blue-eyed McIlvain a real-life Dick Tracy who became the target 
of firebombings, ambushes and assaults because of his crime-busting exploits? 
</P>
<P>
Or, was he a vigilante who staged the attacks for attention -- once allegedly 
even shooting himself in the groin -- just as a demented fireman might 
deliberately set a fire in order to be a hero when he stamps it out? 
</P>
<P>
Most of the stories about Billy Joe McIlvain's life are extraordinary and the 
one about why he decided to become a cop is no less so. 
</P>
<P>
While walking his dog in El Sereno one day at the age of 9, he says he stumbled 
across a cardboard box that contained the severed head of a woman. Her eyes 
were open, her mouth was filled with blood and her expression, he recalls, was 
one of utter helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
"I can still picture her face now," said McIlvain during a recent interview at 
the prison in Soledad. "I think that day I just decided I wanted to help people 
so they wouldn't end up that way." 
</P>
<P>
That same year, 1954, his parents -- conservative, working-class folk of Irish 
and Italian descent -- divorced. Virginia McIlvain, who made circuit breakers 
on an assembly line, soon remarried and took Billy and his sister to live with 
her new husband in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
There, he played tackle on the high school football team, labored over his 
silver '64 Plymouth, enjoyed target shooting with a bolt-action .22-caliber 
rifle and worked part-time with his stepfather making cement mixing machines. 
</P>
<P>
"When most teen-agers were out doing stupid things, he wasn't," said his 
stepfather, Larry Olesen, 58. "He was such a big kid, so big he could probably 
beat the hell out of anybody. But he never did. He was always smiling." 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, when McIlvain joined the San Gabriel Police Department as a rookie, he 
found a small, quiet residential community of 29,000 people that officers 
referred to as "sleepy hollow." Murder was rare and street gangs were in their 
infancy. 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of the population was of Mexican descent, most living just east of 
the San Gabriel Mission and south of the railroad tracks, an area known then 
simply as the barrio. The neighborhood belonged to "Sangra," a tough band of 
about two dozen youths with monikers such as "Spooky," "Wango," "Termite" and 
"Wolf." 
</P>
<P>
David Dominguez, the fourth of 10 children born to Josie Escarcega, was "Lil' 
Loco," the little crazy one. 
</P>
<P>
By 15, he had been to a juvenile camp for receiving stolen property. San 
Gabriel police suspected him of burglary, arson and several shootings. In a 
gang profile prepared by one officer, Dominguez was said to "have access to 
numerous guns and should be considered dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
He also had been a shortstop on his Little League team, worked installing 
sprinklers at a local park, cared for a collection of rabbits, turtles, pigeons 
and cats and drove a two-tone '57 Chevy with a miniature steering wheel that 
officers frequently ticketed him for. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't a perfect boy," said Escarcega, 54. "He had problems in school and 
he may have been disrespectful at times. But he was a young man just beginning 
to live life and he didn't do anything to deserve being killed in such a 
horrible way." 
</P>
<P>
McIlvain says that Sangra began to target him because he was such a good cop. 
He traces the harassment back to 1974, when he helped two Alhambra officers 
make a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
An armed Sangra member jumped from the car, just as McIlvain pulled up with a 
shotgun and told the youth to freeze. "The guy looked at me and said, 'You're a 
dead man,' " McIlvain recalled. 
</P>
<P>
From that point on, he chronicled more than 36 threats or assaults by Sangra, 
from affixing a funeral home sticker to his car to tossing a dummy grenade on 
his porch to an alleyway ambush that left the front window of his patrol car 
shattered. 
</P>
<P>
Some officers, such as McIlvain's partner, Dave Rios, were in awe of his 
professionalism and courage. 
</P>
<P>
"He went out of his way to help people all the time," said Rios, 41, then a 
reserve officer who now works as a deputy sheriff. "If he saw anything, a 
traffic accident or a garage on fire, he'd stop and do something about it. He 
was the best cop I've ever known." 
</P>
<P>
Others called him a "walking dead man" and refused to ride in the same car. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot us thought he just went over the deep end," said one longtime San 
Gabriel officer, who asked not to be identified because the department's policy 
is not to comment on the case. "We just thought, 'He's a danger; he's lost it.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
By 1976, McIlvain nearly had. He was hospitalized for a bleeding ulcer. His 
left hand was almost paralyzed from a scuffle with a suspect. And he had a 
bullet wound in the groin that, he says, came from a masked assailant outside 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
He took to wearing a bullet-proof vest, placed guns at strategic locations 
around his house and carried three more with him at all times -- a .25-caliber 
automatic in his back pocket, a .357 Magnum at his side and another .357 in a 
boot holster. 
</P>
<P>
"They were bent on getting me and they weren't going to give up," said 
McIlvain, who was placed on disability that year. "I was beat. It was like I 
was in a helpless state." 
</P>
<P>
The way McIlvain tells it, he was driving home on the morning of Feb. 28, 1977, 
when David Dominguez pulled up alongside him, pointed a shotgun and demanded he 
pull over. 
</P>
<P>
After driving around for several hours, they ended up at McIlvain's home in 
West Covina. He said he pleaded with Dominguez to spare his family, then ran 
inside and told his wife to grab their infant daughter and flee. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next two hours, 106 shots were fired out the living room window, as 
police and a sheriff's SWAT team surrounded the house. McIlvain said he watched 
helplessly, his feet bound with surgical tape. He also claims that Dominguez 
popped pills and even forced McIlvain to take his picture with a 35mm camera 
that was in the house. Finally, when the gun was turned on him, McIlvain said 
he pulled the .357 concealed in his boot and fired a bullet into Dominguez's 
chest. Then he picked up the shotgun and fired a few more times. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking back on it years later, there's a lot of things you can think of doing 
differently," McIlvain said. "But you don't understand the kind of fear and 
emotion I was under. I felt almost like a robot. I was going to do exactly what 
he said." 
</P>
<P>
McIlvain emerged a hero. There were murmurs of relief and even some light 
applause from the news crews and spectators. Forrester, the West Covina 
detective, ran up and congratulated him. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time he was taken to the police station for a statement, McIlvain's 
story had begun to unravel. A few hours later, he was behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a brilliant individual, but I didn't just fall off the truck," said 
Forrester, 54, a man with a big mustache, long sideburns and a Texas drawl. "I 
looked at him and I said, 'Billy, you've been messing with me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Besides McIlvain's fantastic-sounding story, Forrester said, he was troubled by 
the fact that blood splattered on the walls and on Dominguez already appeared 
to be dry. The supposed captor, just 5-feet 4-inches tall and weighing 135 
pounds, was in his stocking feet -- not exactly kidnaping garb. And his family 
had filed a report of him being falsely arrested that morning by a San Gabriel 
officer in a drugstore parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
When the case went to trial a few months later, an even darker tale emerged. 
Rather than McIlvain as the target of harassment, prosecutors portrayed him as 
the the one doing the harassing. They said he stalked Dominguez, photographed 
him and once hurled a firebomb -- made of shotgun shells and a flare -- at his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Two young reserve officers who had been assigned to protect McIlvain testified 
that he had given them ammunition to shoot up Dominguez's car, that he had 
supplied them with spray paint to write "sheriffs" and "police" on Dominguez's 
driveway and that he once displayed a toy gun that he said could be planted on 
the kid to justify shooting him. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. John F. Hayes, one of two prosecutors in the case, painted a 
picture of a man who lived in a fantasy world, whose story was fiction and 
whose life was a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"McIlvain has watched too many police programs on TV," Hayes told the jury. 
"Did you see what was engraved on the belt he was wearing? 'Hutch.' He's still 
playing the role. He's still Supercop." 
</P>
<P>
On top of it all, a jailhouse informant named Wendall Hall said that McIlvain 
confessed the kidnaping to him and also asked if Hall knew someone who might be 
willing to kill McIlvain's wife, Joyce, and Dominguez's mother before they 
could testify. 
</P>
<P>
But in last week's appeal, McIlvain's lawyers contended that Hall -- a career 
criminal awaiting trial on charges of kidnap and attempted rape -- lied under 
oath. They submitted a signed statement by Hall saying his testimony was false, 
as well as other documents that they say show he was rewarded with only a year 
in county jail. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the ruthlessness and total lack of ethics by the prosecution that 
denied McIlvain a fair trial and his freedom," said his attorney, Charles A. 
Gangloff, who defended him 13 years ago. "It's scandalous and it's horrendous." 
</P>
<P>
In recent interviews, however, several jurors said that Hall's testimony was a 
negligible part of their decision and did not even come up during the 10 hours 
it took them to decide McIlvain was guilty of murder. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the defendant who just wasn't credible," said Morris A. Hooper, a San 
Fernando Valley pharmacist who served as the jury foreman. "His story was so 
unbelievable, so wild. You really questioned how in the world he expected to 
get away with that. Who did he expect to snow?" 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on it, McIlvain acknowledges that parts of his story seem 
far-fetched, that if he really had been held hostage there was ample 
opportunity to kill Dominguez much earlier in the siege. But people who look at 
it that way, he contends, just don't know Billy Joe. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy didn't become a policeman to kill people; he became a policeman to help 
people," said his second wife, Kittie, 51, a former model who married him in 
1987, four years after his first wife filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
He also does not believe all the evidence that would support his case made its 
way into court. The prosecutor, for instance, argued that McIlvain had probably 
executed Dominguez two hours before the last shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
But several years after his conviction, a Los Angeles homicide detective who 
had taken a personal interest in the case discovered two "missing" pages from 
the autopsy while thumbing through the Dominguez file one day in the medical 
examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The documents, which had never been introduced in trial, showed Dominguez's 
liver temperature had not fallen below normal, making it unlikely that he had 
been dead for as long as prosecutors suggested. In addition, the report 
indicated that Dominguez had secobarbital in his system -- a fact that McIlvain 
contended but had been unable to prove. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two factors alone could have put a reasonable doubt in a jury's mind," 
said retired LAPD Detective Steve Tilden, who found the report and for seven 
years spent his off-duty hours researching the case. "Now, I won't say Billy is 
innocent. I don't think he's been truthful at all. But I do think he was 
wrongly convicted, I really do." 
</P>
<P>
Many others go further. Whether it is McIlvain's sincerity, the tears he 
occasionally sheds, the apparent irregularities in his trial or simply an 
unwillingness to believe that a policeman would do such a horrendous thing, 
there are those convinced of his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1988 letter to the state Board of Prison Terms, a top official of the 
National Assn. of Chiefs of Police called McIlvain a hero who should never have 
been sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
"Not just because Billy is a police officer (once a P.O., always a P.O.)," 
wrote the group's New York president, Albert W. Weir. "But because we always 
want justice, no matter what the cause." 
</P>
<P>
David Soul, who played "Hutch" in the TV series from 1975 to 1980, said he made 
his decision to support McIlvain after traveling to Soledad and meeting him 
face to face. They speak regularly on the telephone and Soul has pledged to 
help him any way he can. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I'm an actor. . . . I'm no fool," said Soul, who is living and writing 
in Los Angeles. "After listening to him tell his story the way he told it, I 
was convinced as a person, as a human being, that this man was innocent." 
</P>
<P>
There is no reason to believe that President Bush has made the same judgment, 
but several years ago, in response to a plea for help from McIlvain, he began 
sending Christmas cards to his Soledad address. "Much happiness and peace for 
you and those you love," reads the one that McIlvain -- and 125,000 other 
people on the White House list -- received last year. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, no court has extended the same warm wishes. The original trial 
judge, William B. Keene, who retired years ago and went on to preside over 
"Divorce Court" on daytime television, concluded that the evidence of 
McIlvain's guilt was overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, an appellate court concurred. In 1982, McIlvain filed a motion for a 
new trial but was denied. Again in 1985, he filed a petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus, but it also was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"Locked up in your mind is the truth," Keene told McIlvain in his ruling. 
"Someday we may hear the truth. We didn't hear it here in this court from you." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, McIlvain spends his days writing letters -- he estimates 
10,000 to date -- trying to generate interest in his case. He works as a clerk 
typing disciplinary reports, watches the news on TV and does pullups on the 
side of his steel bunk bed. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has saved nine lives while in prison and is friendly with the 
guards, several of whom have written recommendations that he be paroled. But 
since he became eligible for parole in 1983, he has been denied each time. 
</P>
<P>
One of these days, he believes he will get out. He says he has offers to teach 
courses on police-officer survival at several academies and universities. 
First, he'll buy a motor home and travel the country with Kittie. But for now, 
he must wait. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what the truth is," McIlvain said. "I think eventually someone's going 
to listen."

SERRA DEFENSIVE BACK LOPEZ IS STILL WAITING FOR A COLLEGE BID; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: SHRINE GAME PARTICIPANT IS ONE OF THREE PLAYERS ON SOUTH TEAM WHO 
REMAIN UNCOMMITTED TO A COLLEGE. 
</P>

<P>
Of the 32 football players chosen to participate for the South squad in 
Saturday's 39th annual Shrine Game, Clayton Lopez is one of only three who 
remain unsigned and uncommitted to a college. 
</P>
<P>
But Lopez, a defensive back from Serra High School, doesn't appear worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just out here to have fun," Lopez said after a recent South team workout 
at UC Irvine. "I'm a pretty strong person and I know what I need to do. My 
playing speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the calmness of Lopez' demeanor and the strength of his attitude on 
life is the result of what he has already had to endure. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, 18, has learned a lot about life in the past 15 months, and football now 
has become just a means of getting an education. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not thinking about the pros," he said. "I'm just thinking about getting my 
education -- that's it. You can take football away from me, but you can't take 
away my education. I've got a good head on my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez didn't always have this feeling about football. It all changed for him in 
his junior year as he was gamboling through life, participating in high school 
sports year-round. After football season, he moved on to basketball, then 
track. Life was good. Life was easy. 
</P>
<P>
Then it changed. 
</P>
<P>
His teammate, Demar Harper, was killed in an auto accident less than a block 
from another friend's house where Lopez was hanging out. Harper, a sophomore 
linebacker, died instantly when the car in which he was riding collided with 
another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a track meet that day and just before he left, I asked him what time he 
was coming back (for the meet). He told me the time, and I said, 'All right, 
I'll see you then,' " Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
The next time Lopez saw his teammate, Harper was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Harper's death was hard on Lopez, just as it was to the rest of the Serra 
football team, which dedicated its 1989 season to Harper. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me appreciate life a lot more," Lopez said. "You never know when you 
are gonna go." 
</P>
<P>
Serra made the most of the season despite the loss of its starting linebacker. 
The Cavaliers earned their third straight Camino Real League title, and went on 
to defeat Lompoc, 34-31, in the Southern Section Division VII championship 
game. Serra finished 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
The initials on the right sleeve of his Serra jersey remind Lopez of the good 
friend whom he lost. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys on the (Shrine) team thought the DH on my arm stands for 'designated 
hitter,' " Lopez said as he tugged at his jersey sleeve. "They call me DH now." 
</P>
<P>
Hitting is something Lopez loves to do -- the harder the better. 
</P>
<P>
"In the third quarter, that's when other people tend to ease up. I have to show 
them that I'm not going to ease up until the game is over," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-11, 173-pound defender said that he hit his opponents so hard last 
year that he knocked himself unconscious twice. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't (make an interception), the next best thing is to hit (the 
receiver) as hard as you can," Lopez said. "From a cornerback position that's 
kind of hard to do, but from free safety you can let him know who you are real 
quick." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez had eight interceptions from his free safety position in 1989 to set a 
school season record. In the Shrine Game, he will play cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez's off-the-field demeanor, quiet and somewhat subdued, belies his 
intensity once he dons his equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"When I touch that grass, I'm a different person," he said. "You have to change 
your attitude when you get out there -- especially when you play defense. 
You've got to be mean and aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez's successful senior season was followed by scholarship offers from 
several universities in the West, among them USC, Washington, New Mexico State 
and Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
But Lopez failed to score 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, and the offers 
stopped. Lopez says he passed the SAT on his second attempt, but there were no 
scholarships available by then. 
</P>
<P>
Now the defensive back is left to consider community college ball at El Camino 
or Long Beach City to showcase himself for a Division I offer. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Coach John Featherstone has been in contact with Lopez on several 
occasions and hopes he will choose to be a Warrior. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the world of Clayton," Featherstone said. "We've been watching him 
for two years now and we think he is the best cornerback available in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Clayton would fit perfectly into our defensive scheme here. This is a great 
chance for him to come in and compete for us right now." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez will decide his future in football after the Shrine Game, but for now 
he's just enjoying his new friends, playing dominoes, shooting pool and 
"telling war stories" with some of the best college recruits in Southern 
California.

WOODLAND HILLS WEST'S BOBBY KIM CAN DUST OFF THE PLATE AND THE OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bobby Kim will be busy cleaning again this weekend at UCLA's Jackie Robinson 
Stadium, polishing his brash attitude and sweeping doubts about his cockiness 
under home plate. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, Woodland Hills West's charismatic catcher, thrives on opportunities to 
exhibit his cleanliness. And he will have plenty of opportunities to do so when 
West (23-4) puts its 20-game American Legion winning streak on the line in a 
6th Area tournament game against Culver City today at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Kim orchestrates a tedious parade of rituals during each at-bat. It's a 
nerve-testing performance that has frustrated and amused his teammates and 
perturbed opponents. 
</P>
<P>
* He enters the batter's box and takes as long as 20 seconds to "clean" it, 
moving dirt around with his feet. 
</P>
<P>
* He looks at the catcher and umpire. "I don't talk to catchers, because I hate 
them," he said. "But if the umpire is a nice guy, and I know him, I'll smile." 
</P>
<P>
* He leaves the box, grabs a handful of dirt and wipes it on his bat handle. 
More cleaning, he says. 
</P>
<P>
* He looks for signs from Coach Don Hornback and again cleans his bat -- this 
time wiping it between his left arm and body. "I really don't know how I 
started that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
* He enters the box. If the umpire asks him to hurry, which is usually the 
case, he leaves the box again. 
</P>
<P>
* He re-enters the box, takes two abbreviated swings, and holds his bat toward 
the pitching mound until the pitcher begins his windup. 
</P>
<P>
Kim isn't a human rain delay. He's a monsoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, he jerks around, digs in, wipes his bat, calls time," teammate Sean Boldt 
said. "The first time I saw it, I was looking around the field because I 
thought something was wrong, like somebody had wandered onto the field or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood Coach Marty Biegel, frustrated because of a five-run deficit, 
screamed at Kim to hurry up. 
</P>
<P>
"You're worse than Lenny Dykstra!" Biegel yelled. 
</P>
<P>
That's vintage Kim. A 6-foot-1, 190-pound catcher whose family emigrated from 
Korea in 1984, Kim has had no problem assimilating into West's squad, which 
contains more characters than a Saturday morning cartoon show. 
</P>
<P>
There's Pat Treend, a 6-4, red-haired Eagle Scout who throws 85 m.p.h and is 
nicknamed "Farm Boy." And Jason Cohen, the talkative first baseman who has as 
many opinions as curls and refers to his teammates as "kids." 
</P>
<P>
It's a perfect setting for the player teammates have nicknamed "The Samurai." 
Kim, an All-West Valley League linebacker at El Camino Real High last fall, 
earned his title with antics that almost exceed his pain threshold. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid's crazy," Cohen said. "It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen has the honorable task of taping Kim's ailments. Cohen earned the job 
during West's run at the American Legion World Series title last summer, when 
Kim played with torn ligaments in the thumb of his catching hand. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kim could barely swing a bat, he continued to play as West reached the 
championship game in Millington, Tenn. During the team's victory over Guaynabo 
of Puerto Rico, Kim winced each time Treend stung him with a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"That had to be one of the most courageous things ever," Treend said. "I could 
see his eyes water through the mask. He was just deflecting the ball and 
picking it up in front of him." 
</P>
<P>
Kim's hand has since healed, so he satisfies his need for pain with collisions 
at home plate. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I tried football, guys ran over me and I loved it," he said. 
"Coach (Mike) Maio said the same thing will happen to me as a catcher, and I 
liked that idea." 
</P>
<P>
Thus home plate became home sweet home for Kim, who had played left field for 
El Camino Real's varsity as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"Left field was just too boring," he said. "As a catcher, I get to catch the 
ball all the time. Especially during a play at the plate, when someone tries to 
run over me." 
</P>
<P>
Kim's teammates enjoy the collisions almost as much as Kim does. 
</P>
<P>
"He's flat-out hurt a couple of guys who have tried to score," Boldt said. "I'm 
sure other teams see this 6-1 Korean when they're rounding third and wonder if 
it's worth it to try and score." 
</P>
<P>
Former Kennedy player Gino Tagliaferri, a 5-11, 190-pound shortstop, felt he 
could match tonnage with Kim. The result was a collision that might have 
registered on the Richter scale. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither one gave an inch," Cohen said. "Bobby came up and got in his face, 
then realized who it was and immediately said, 'Sorry.' With a guy Gino's size, 
Bobby wasn't about to start any trouble." 
</P>
<P>
That was one of the few times Kim conceded he wasn't king of the diamond. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get on the field, I think I'm the best catcher and best hitter out 
there," Kim said. "If I didn't think that, there's no way I could compete with 
the rest." 
</P>
<P>
Kim, batting .386 (17 for 44) with three home runs and 19 runs batted in, is 
one of the players Hornback likes to have at bat during a close game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big-game player," Hornback said. "He's very competitive and a good team 
man. You can count on him to be there in the big ones." 
</P>
<P>
Kim also can be reliable if you need an extra minute or two to grab a hot dog 
at the concession stand. He can be relied on to enter and re-enter the batter's 
box. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you can count on it," he said with a grin. "It's playoff time."

ON COMEBACK TRAIL WITH BUCK OWENS; 
</P>
<P>
THE FAMED COUNTRY MUSIC SINGER COMES OUT OF RETIREMENT WITH HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buck Owens is one of the all-time greats of country music. Between 1960 and 
1979, he scored more than 2 dozen No. 1 hits on the national country charts. He 
sold untold millions of albums, and he performed at Carnegie Hall and Madison 
Square Garden in New York and Royal Albert Hall in London. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many other superstars of the past, Owens, 60, is enjoying a comeback. 
But, in his case, it really is a comeback -- not just a sudden resurgence in 
popularity after a long dry spell. Owens will be appearing Sunday night at 
Leo's Little Bit O' Country in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Owens came back to music after a nine-year break. The reason he 
bowed out, he said, was his growing dissatisfaction with the direction country 
music was heading in the late 1970s: away from traditional twang and toward a 
more refined, sanitized country-pop sound. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretentious and contrived," Owens said. "It was so far removed from 
real country that it belonged on another planet. To me, it's either country or 
it ain't; it can't be half of this and half of that. Country is when you play 
that steel guitar and make her twang, folks, not all these big, pretty, 
polished sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the time, that's where country was going, and that's what country radio 
stations were playing. I got very discouraged; it seemed like people were 
getting tired of me, and my heart was no longer in it. So finally, I just 
decided to drop out." 
</P>
<P>
After giving up music in 1979, Owens busied himself in other endeavors. He 
bought and sold real estate, made a lot of investments, and acquired four 
country radio stations -- two in Bakersfield, where he's lived since he was 21, 
and two in Phoenix, where he had spent most of his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
And, even though he didn't end his association with television's syndicated 
country-variety "Hee Haw" series until 1986, after 17 years as co-host, Owens 
still had plenty of free time on his hands to do the things he had always 
dreamed of doing. 
</P>
<P>
"All those years I was out touring, my entertainer friends kept saying, 'When I 
don't have to go on the road anymore, here's what I'm gonna do,' " Owens 
recalled. "So when I gave up music, I began doing all these things: I played 
golf, I played tennis, I went fishing. There was no pressure, nobody calling me 
up and saying, 'We've got to get up to Vancouver for this Friday date.' 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed it for a while, but eventually, I started getting bored -- and then, 
in walks Dwight." 
</P>
<P>
As in Dwight Yoakam, the brash young "new traditionalist" who is at the 
forefront of country's burgeoning back-to-twang movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting at home in front of the TV one night, watching this show called 
'Austin City Limits,' and this young rubber-legged boy named Dwight Yoakam gets 
on stage and says he wants to dedicate his song to Buck Owens and the whole 
gang back in Bakersfield," Owens recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"That was in the summer of 1987. In the fall, I was working in my office, when 
my secretary comes in and says, 'A guy named Dwight Yoakam just walked in and 
he wants to talk to you.' It turns out he was going to play the county fair 
that night, and he wanted me to go out there with him. 
</P>
<P>
"By then, I had been listening to his music, and I really liked what he was 
doing -- bringing back the old sound. So I said, 'Yeah, I'll go out there with 
you,' and that's what started it all. His band knew a bunch of my songs, and I 
did them all -- for the first time in I don't know how long -- with Dwight." 
</P>
<P>
After that, CBS invited Owens to appear on a special about country music and he 
brought along Dwight. They performed a song off Owens' "Streets of Bakersfield" 
album from the 1970s. Yoakam then included the song on his next album. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden," said Owens, "I've got my first No. 1 record in something 
like 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
The surprise success of his duet with Yoakam made Owens a hot property again, 
and he soon found himself pursued by record companies. He ended up signing with 
Capitol Records, the label he had been on during his halcyon days. 
</P>
<P>
Owens' album, "Hot Dog," came out in the fall of 1988 and was an immediate hit. 
So was his follow-up, "Act Naturally," released last October. The title track, 
and first single, was a duet with Ringo Starr. The tune was written and 
originally recorded by Owens in the mid-1960s and later covered by the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
He's working on yet another album -- and spending as much time on the road as 
he ever did. 
</P>
<P>
"Being 60 years old, and having people still enjoy seeing you and watching you 
perform, and having a major record label spend major money to do your records, 
it's a big deal for me," Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing it for fun, for all the people who want to come out to little clubs 
and hear some good old-fashioned honky-tonk music -- and who believe, like I 
do, that if it ain't got no twang, it don't mean a thang."

A MODERN JOSHUA; 
</P>
<P>
DID BIG JAY MCNEELEY BLOW DOWN THE BERLIN WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Big Jay McNeeley isn't particularly worried about the outcome of the Battle of 
the Saxes he's participating in with Chuck Higgins on Friday, July 27 at the 
Saddleback Inn. He's been in scores of reed skirmishes since the 1940s, and for 
years, McNeeley claims, his supremacy has been "a determined factor. It's 
obvious who won." 
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old sax man may not be shy about touting his own abilities, but his 
estimations seem downright modest compared to some of the write-ups he's had. 
The current issue of the nostalgia mag Sh-boom wrote of a show McNeeley played 
in Berlin the night the wall came down last year, noting, "It was difficult to 
tell if the pandemonium inside the club was any less than the jubilation atop 
the wall a few blocks away." A German review went farther, calling McNeeley "a 
modern Joshua" and suggesting that his tenor sax had blown the wall down. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, where there is a respect for American musical history, McNeeley is 
esteemed for his 1949 No. 1 R&amp;B hit "Deacon's Hop" and such lively titles 
as "Jet Fury," "3-D" and a '53 single whose A and B sides were "Catastrophe" 
and "Calamity." 
</P>
<P>
The early '50s were the era of honking, garishly attired sax heroes, including 
his Battle of the Saxes opponent Higgins, whose '50s titles included "Pachuco 
Hop," "Motor Head Baby," "Greasy Pig" and "Eye'ball." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Friday's sax standoff, a benefit for the county homeless, McNeeley 
said: "We're trying to bring something back that a lot of people haven't seen 
in a long time. We have a lot of old fans that like this, and new ones who have 
never seen anything like it. We really entertain the people." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the father of all this stuff, you know," McNeeley maintains. "Those guys 
really came after me. I was the one who started all the honkin' and screamin' 
and layin' on the floor and hollerin' and all." 
</P>
<P>
The Watts-born McNeeley began his career as a jazzman, sharing the stage, he 
said, with the likes of Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Criss and Miles 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I started playing jazz, but then I started thinking I wanted to make some 
money," he said with a laugh. "So I thought, 'Where do I fit into the program?' 
and started doing the showmanship." 
</P>
<P>
Initially he just liked marching through audiences while he played. He recalls 
one show at Chicago's Wrigley Field where he and Lionel Hampton's band wound up 
crawling around the infield on all fours. 
</P>
<P>
The floor-rolling began in 1951 in Clarksville, Tenn. "After we played for the 
first hour there was no response from the people. I got on my knees and nothing 
happened, so I thought, 'Nothin' to do but roll on the floor.' I did that, and 
it really caught people's attention. It broke the spell. So I said, 'Hey, I'm 
going to try this when I get to Texas!' It went over big there, so I kept it in 
the act." 
</P>
<P>
When others began copying his antics, McNeeley was moved to paint his sax with 
fluorescent paint. "They'd turn out the lights, turn on a black light, and my 
sax was all anybody could see. I used that very effectively through my 
travels." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have seen McNeeley's recent club appearances, or his floor-dusting 
bit of showmanship on the 1987 Grammy broadcast, know that he stays in shape 
and still puts on a honking wild act. He continues to add new flash to his 
playing by way of electronic effects. 
</P>
<P>
"I have synthesizers, an SPX90 (a digital processor), echo delays, an octave 
box, pitch change, chorus. I've got a wireless where I walk all through the 
audience. We opened up for this big electric band in Germany, and we put a 
hurtin' on them. They think, 'small band -- puny small sound.' Then we surprise 
them." 
</P>
<P>
But it wouldn't be sporting to whip out all this technology in a sax battle, 
would it? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah, I'm going to hit him with everything. In fact I just got a new 
wireless that lets me activate my effects with it while I'm walking. You have 
to keep up to date. You realize my first record was in 1949, 40 years ago. A 
lot of players still sound like they're playing back then." 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-'60s McNeeley found that his gigs were drying up in the wake of 
Beatlemania, and he left the business, not returning until 1983. Though the job 
prospects in his native state still aren't ideal, like many of his peers he has 
found a warm welcome overseas.

"If I wanted to I could work 365 days a year in Europe. It's great. They make 
you feel the way musicians used to feel. Like when Duke or Basie and the guys 
would come to town, they were treated like they were doctors and lawyers. They 
had that deep respect for them. It's still like that there today. 
</P>
<P>
"They know all about you. It's like they carry a library around with them. They 
want to know who played on this record, every little thing. Their enthusiasm is 
incredible. There was one guy in Frankfurt who had paid 440 marks for one of my 
records. That's $240! It's amazing how different it is in Europe. People get a 
lot of attractions -- it's not like they're hungry. They're just very 
enthusiastic."

A couple of years ago he found that some of his biggest fans were living on the 
other side of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I went as a tourist into East Berlin and was introduced to this couple who had 
bought my first record 40 years ago. I had dinner with them and they showed me 
all around East Berlin. It was real sad because as much as they wanted to, they 
couldn't get out to hear me play. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the second time I was there, we were playing in a club called 
Quasimodo's, and the Wall came down around 11 p.m. It was incredible. We had to 
walk back to where we were staying. There was no way to drive because everybody 
was in the streets celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
"Then when I was playing there this year, my friends from East Berlin were 
sitting right in front. After all these years they finally had a chance to 
groove with us."

McNeeley has two albums due out shortly. One will be a German-release 
funk-based live set. "It's called 'Big Jay Blows the Wall Down.' It's got a 
great album cover, where it looks like I'm coming through the wall at ya." He 
also has a country album in the can geared for domestic release. "I do 'I 
EECan't Stop Loving You' and 'There's Something on Your Mind' (his biggest '50s 
hit) country style. I play some wild sax like in the '50s. I'm very pleased 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
Though he's near the mandatory retirement age for many businesses, McNeeley has 
no immediate plans to hang up his sax. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good on this European trip and I'm looking forward to the next one. I 
just worked with Cab Calloway, and he's 83, and he sounds just as good as he 
did 40 or 50 years ago. He had a bunch of young cats and they were cooking. Who 
knows, I may go another five or seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"We did an encore at this last European festival that lasted a whole hour, 
after an hour-and-a-half show. That's how much enthusiasm was going. Every time 
we'd try to get off, people would call us back. I've still got a lot of energy 
for the music."
