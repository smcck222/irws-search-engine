I suppose that I should not find it surprising that Reagan, whose 
Administration was involved in everything from illegal arms deals to supporting 
terrorists, is praising Nixon's record. 
</P>
<P>
While the activities of the Nixon Administration may seem somewhat tame by 
comparison, that makes them no less repugnant. Perhaps we are as a nation 
forgetting what responsible leadership means to such an extent that someday the 
appalling actions of Nixon will seem commonplace, and historians will indeed 
praise his achievements. However, if there is any justice (or indeed morality) 
in the world, it will be the moral failing of the Reagan Administration that 
will be recognized, not the dubious successes of the Nixon Administration.

FAMILY WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
KIND AND GENTLE, EH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, true to his promise, has vetoed the Family and Medical Leave 
Act, which would have allowed working mothers and fathers to take a little time 
off -- without pay but without losing a job -- to tend to a new baby or newly 
adopted child, or to care for a seriously ill child, spouse or elderly parent. 
The veto was a vote against compassion. 
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives could not muster the votes to override the veto, 
but the issue is not dead. The chief sponsors, Rep. Patricia Schroeder 
(D-Colo.) and Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), have promised to introduce 
the measure again and again until unpaid family leave becomes law. Family leave 
is essential because most parents -- including mothers -- work outside the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
In the next round, supporters must persuade business leaders, who fought the 
measure on the basis of cost, that the costs are much higher in lost earnings 
when unpaid leave is not permitted. Republican supporters, like Rep. Marge 
Roukema of New Jersey, must point out again the flaw in the President's 
argument. Bush supports parental leave on a voluntary basis, and wants the 
benefit negotiated between employers and employees. That strategy holds little 
promise for most workers because fewer than 20% belong to a union. 
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address, Bush promised a kinder, gentler nation. There is 
nothing kind or gentle about forcing an employee to choose between holding onto 
a job or tending to a sick child.

GIVE THIS IDEA A FREE RIDE; 
</P>
<P>
RTD'S CURRENT INDUCEMENT MIGHT WOO BACK FORMER RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fresh ideas in public transportation are about as common as seats on a 
rush-hour bus. The only thing in shorter supply is a fresh idea that is also a 
good idea. At first glance, the Southern California Rapid Transit District's 
notion that passengers should ride free if their bus arrives more than 15 
minutes behind schedule seems to meet both criteria. It certainly is worth the 
test run RTD has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you have to ask why, if this is such a great idea, it hasn't been 
going on for years? The RTD says that until recently its fleet was too small to 
even think of free rides. With 2,000 buses, however, it has a fighting chance 
to stay on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago was appalled by the idea. A spokesman for the region's transit 
authority rejected the idea out of hand as something they would never try. It 
conjured up pictures of buses stalled by fires on their route, traffic jams and 
other random ways of knocking buses off schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a big difference between the cities. Chicago doesn't need such a 
plan. It has a long tradition of rail and bus transportation that works as well 
as any city, and better than most. Los Angeles is still trying to create such a 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The idea could come unglued in several ways, but the RTD seems to have most of 
them in hand. People with bus passes would get a chit they could use to reduce 
the cost of the next month's pass. The agency is still pondering the rider who 
pays his fare before the bus starts running late and then watches a parade of 
people get on for free. 
</P>
<P>
The most appealing thing about the idea is the most difficult to quantify. It 
would demonstrate good faith and honest effort for riders who have stuck with 
the system through some rude times in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
To be both a fresh idea and a good one, the word on good faith would have to 
get around to people who have abandoned the system. This is the only way 
Southern California can create a transit tradition of its own. That makes this 
worth trying.

The many assumptions that esteemed British historian Paul Johnson ("Destiny 
Derailed, Then Triumphant," Commentary, July 16) tries to push over on us as 
historical fact are too numerous to discount here. And, his statement that the 
U.S. Constitution is "idealistic" and "impossible for a President to observe it 
in the spirit and the letter, and at the same time, protect America's interests 
in a wicked world" comes across as a feeble attempt to picture Richard Nixon as 
a victim of a "public witch hunt" and Watergate as a "forgotten footnote." 
</P>
<P>
But, Johnson is a propagandist here, because he commits three cardinal sins of 
the historian. First, he boldly declares what would have happened "if" by 
arguing that the Soviet Empire would have collapsed "several years earlier" if 
Nixon had not been a victim of a Democratic Congress. Second, he asserts that 
the American people were of one mind by opining that the "support they gave 
Reagan was their way of signifying, without actually admitting, that they owed 
Nixon an apology." Third, he declares Reagan "deserves credit for bringing the 
Cold War to a successful conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson knows better than to give a development such as the sweeping changes in 
the Soviet Union a simple, single-causation image. History demands a period of 
10 to 20 years to provide the perspective to understand its many causes and 
effects. What is going on in Gorbachev's Russia is not history yet but current 
events. Only time can reveal to us what has both caused it and what its full 
significance will be. 
</P>
<P>
It is perfectly acceptable for the historian to include his political bias into 
his interpretation of events. But it is shameful for the propagandist to 
present his biased views of history.

Worse than burning the flag -- worse than parading Willie Horton -- worse than

Worse than all these is the desecration of all the ideals our country is 
supposed to stand for was the obscene spectacle of three ex-Presidents honoring 
a man who escaped impeachment by resigning.

Nixon's latest bid for personal glory once again garners praise from the naive 
just as it did when he sponsored China's entry into the United Nations and 
stabbed our faithful ally Taiwan in the back. What is more, Nixon's act was an 
embarrassment and affront to all the Asians who supported America's decision to 
exclude and embargo China.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
CLEAR AWAY OBSTACLES TO WORKFARE; 
</P>
<P>
THE STATE'S PROGRAM IS MAKING PROGRESS, BUT PUTTING PEOPLE IN JOBS MUST BECOME 
THE TOP PRIORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN, George Deukmejian is the governor of of California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One goal I have stressed repeatly throughout eight years as governor and 28 
years in public life is to help create a broadly based prosperity in California 
that leaves no one behind. We have made great strides toward that goal in the 
last eight years. For example, nearly 3.2 million new jobs have been created 
and our unemployment rate has been cut by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, as the following data show, a serious welfare-dependency problem 
remains, one that seems impervious to our state's overall prosperity: 
</P>
<P>
 -- California's welfare caseload is growing twice as fast as the general 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One in every six children residing in our state comes from a family on 
welfare; more than 2 million people here receive these benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- California, with 12% of America's population, is spending 22% of the 
nation's welfare dollars. Except for Alaska and one county in New York, 
California's current $694 monthly welfare payment for a family of three is the 
highest in the nation and does not include other assistance, such as food 
stamps and Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming year, total funding for health and welfare programs in our state 
will increase to $26 billion, almost double the $15.5 billion we were spending 
when I assumed office. 
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of people depending on welfare did not begin with my 
Administration. Former governors, beginning with Ronald Reagan, faced similar 
trends. In 1985, my Administration tried a new approach. We enacted the most 
comprehensive welfare-reform measure in two decades, the Greater Avenues for 
Independence program. The aim of the GAIN program was to place welfare 
recipients in jobs in the private sector to give them fresh hope and benefit 
taxpayers in the bargain. To date, we have committed more than $850 million to 
this program -- above and beyond our standard welfare expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
I am impressed by reports from people GAIN has helped, like one former welfare 
recipient who has acquired skills, is working in a school district and plans to 
become a teacher. She says that her children are more motivated in school, that 
their grades have risen and that she has discovered, "You do not have to be a 
prisoner to welfare." 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite such success stories, GAIN is placing far fewer people in jobs and 
at a much higher cost than originally anticipated. Overall, it is not reducing 
the welfare rolls or cutting welfare costs. 
</P>
<P>
I believe it is time for an honest examination of GAIN's track record -- and a 
willingness to enact major changes to make this worthy program more effective. 
</P>
<P>
For example, we originally intended GAIN to place a heavy emphasis on 
job-seeking up front. However, in a key compromise we accepted in order to 
enact the legislation, a provision was added that basic education -- such as 
language or math study, high school-equivalence preparation or English as a 
second language -- would be provided to people who needed this training before 
they had to seek work. It was estimated that 20% of GAIN registrants would need 
such education. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, since the program began in 1986, more than 60% of GAIN registrants, 
including some who would prefer to work, are being identified as needing basic 
education, rather than being placed in the job market. This is the primary 
reason that the program is costing much more than expected. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, if welfare recipients are attending college, even if they are 
pursuing a graduate degree, they are deferred from the requirement to seek 
employment. GAIN pays for transportation, child care and other support services 
for two years. Even after that, people on welfare can continue pursuing higher 
education as long as they desire. They can even seek a Ph.D. This delays 
.............their employment and is an excessive burden on taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
California cannot afford this kind of welfare system. We must go back to 
basics. We need to give a hand to those who cannot help themselves for a short 
period of time, until they can make it on their own. In turn, those we help 
must help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
We need to rededicate ourselves to the original intent of the GAIN approach. 
GAIN should be transformed into a true "workfare" program, where the immediate 
priority is to remove people from welfare rolls and put them on payrolls as 
quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, I am proposing that we take the following steps to make GAIN what it 
was supposed to be: a program of work, opportunity and self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
First, all participants should be required to look for jobs before being 
diverted into any education or training program. Let the job marketplace, not 
case workers, determine who is employable. I am proposing that we lengthen this 
job-search effort from the current three weeks to six weeks to allow more time 
to test the labor market. Only if participants cannot find work after this 
intensive job-search effort and they demonstrate a lack of fundamental skills, 
should they be directed to basic education or vocational training. 
</P>
<P>
Second, I am proposing that we limit basic education and vocational training to 
six months, at which point participants must again begin intensive job-search 
efforts, and that the law be changed to require that any participant who finds 
full-time employment paying at least minimum wage should be required to take 
the job. If the level of earnings is not enough to support a single-parent 
family (88% of the caseload) they would still be able to receive supplemental 
welfare payments, but at a reduced cost to taxpayers. And they would be 
acquiring work experience. Only if they are unable to find a job after these 
efforts should they be given additional education or vocational skills 
training. 
</P>
<P>
Third, I am proposing that our welfare system stop subsidizing all 
post-secondary education that is not part of basic education or vocational 
training intended for rapid employment. Our welfare program was not designed to 
be a college or graduate-school scholarship program. Those already in the 
middle of higher-education courses would be allowed to complete the semester, 
but that's all. No one who is able to work should be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
California already spends well over half of its state budget on education, and 
we fund generous higher-education grant and loan programs for low-income 
individuals. Our community college system is the largest in the nation and 
among the least expensive. Welfare recipients who find employment can pursue 
this education on their own time as other taxpayers do. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth, I am proposing that measures be strengthened to require mandatory 
participation in GAIN; under the current system, they are too lax. It's 
mandatory that the taxpayers pay the bill for California's welfare system. It 
should be mandatory that those who are able to work make an effort to find a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
And I will be proposing additional measures to encourage more efforts by the 
private sector to hire and train welfare recipients, to make the process less 
cumbersome and to strengthen the state's ability to temporarily place those who 
cannot initially find work in public or nonprofit agencies to gain experience. 
</P>
<P>
When a society as prosperous and as compassionate as ours is faced with a 
growing class of its citizens who have little to hope for other than a life on 
welfare, then something is seriously wrong. Finding the answer to this 
unacceptable dilemma has been a long, hard struggle. 
</P>
<P>
GAIN was a landmark first step. We must now take the necessary additional steps 
to ensure that GAIN remains true to its central purpose -- transferring welfare 
checks into paychecks and dependency into opportunity for every Californian.

KOREA USES REUNIFICATION TO HIDE ITS OWN REPRESSION; 
</P>
<P>
HUMAN RIGHTS: ROH TAE WOO TALKS OF LINKS WITH THE NORTH, BUT MANY CHARGE IT'S A 
PLOY TO KEEP THE SOUTH DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS M. FOGLIETTA, Rep. Thomas M. Foglietta (D-Pa.) accompanied 
human-rights leader Kim Dae Jung on his return to Korea in 1985. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world is experiencing reunification fever. But while Germany's efforts are 
truly good news, South Korea's reunification soundings with North Korea are 
only a smoke screen to hide human-rights violations and to abolish direct 
election of the president. 
</P>
<P>
The reunification issue must not divert America's attention from the threat to 
democracy posed by the actions of South Korean President Roh Tae Woo's ruling 
Democratic Liberal Party. 
</P>
<P>
When Roh was elected in 1987, he vowed to enact democratic reforms and observe 
human rights. At that time, many Koreans and Americans were heartened by the 
new freedom enjoyed by the press and the notable participation of loyal 
opposition parties in running the country. 
</P>
<P>
But in May, Roh merged his Democratic Justice Party with two of the three 
existing opposition parties to form the Democratic Liberal Party. Last week, 
the new party reportedly railroaded 26 laws through the legislature in 30 
seconds, leaving members of the remaining opposition with gaping mouths. Among 
these was a law consolidating the army, navy and air force under a new 
all-powerful chief not even accountable to the South Korean secretary of 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, hundreds of thousands of South Koreans protested for democracy. 
On Monday, the entire opposition -- 79 members of the 299-member legislature -- 
resigned en masse, warning that Roh was trying to use relations with North 
Korea to divert attention from his domestic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Human and labor rights are widely violated. Asia Watch reports that South Korea 
holds more than 1,000 political prisoners. Many of these political prisoners 
are labor activists, detained under an arcane law that forbids third parties, 
even lawyers, from giving advice in a labor dispute. Last year, the National 
Assembly passed revisions to this third-party intervention law, only to have 
them vetoed by Roh. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most ironic in light of Roh's new emphasis on reunification is the 
government's widespread use of the national security law, which forbids 
unauthorized contacts with North Korea, to detain persons who express 
viewpoints at odds with the government. The opposition has proposed major 
revisions to this law, but the ruling party keeps refusing to consider them. 
</P>
<P>
But the most serious threat to South Korean democracy comes in a seemingly 
innocuous form -- the ruling party's threat to amend the South Korean 
constitution to move to a parliamentary form of government. This would end 
direct election of the president and mean a virtual return to dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
The three leaders who consolidated power in the Democratic Liberal Party 
earlier this year would be able to hand-pick a puppet prime minister, who could 
eliminate the freedoms that the people of South Korea have so valiantly strived 
to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, American policy can and should make a difference. With a trade 
volume topping $30 billion and about 40,000 U.S. troops still stationed there, 
the close relationship between our two governments is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Human-rights violations by the Korean government, a government so strongly 
supported by the United States, fuel anti-American sentiments among the Korean 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Rightly or wrongly, some Koreans blame the United States for the 1980 Kwangju 
massacre, in which about 200 (by the official count) to 2,000 (according to 
popular belief) protestors were killed by the military. In May, students set 
fire to the U.S. Information Service center in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Yet U.S. policy has largely ignored South Korea's human rights violations. Last 
October, Roh traveled to the United States and was welcomed with open arms. He 
was invited to meet with President Bush and to address a joint session of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Our commitment is not just to the South Korean government, but to the Korean 
people. We must begin to put diplomatic pressure on the Roh government to allow 
freedom of expression and association. We also should strongly urge Roh to 
maintain South Korea's presidential system of government. 
</P>
<P>
As Roh spouts reunification rhetoric, the United States government must 
challenge him to put his own house in order first. There will be plenty of time 
to slowly but surely build a walkway to the house next door.

Despite the grumbles from the political extremes, Bush's appointment of David 
H. Souter to the Supreme Court has every indication of being a superb choice -- 
both substantively and politically. 
</P>
<P>
What the country should care about is that the New Hampshire jurist -- by the 
unanimous testimony of those who know him -- brings a powerful, superbly 
trained legal intellect, disciplined work habits and genuine independence of 
judgment to the issues before the high court.

<P>
The political finesse of Bush's first Supreme Court appointment is underlined 
by the array of attractive options now open to him for those who may follow 
Souter. After naming an easily confirmable conservative who shares his own New 
England, Yankee, WASP heritage to replace Justice William J. Brennan Jr., Bush 
has put himself into a position where he can play tough but rewarding ethnic 
and ideological politics with subsequent Supreme Court choices. 
</P>
<P>
The tip-off to the long-term strategy came in the eagerness with which White 
House officials aided reporters in learning the identities of those who they 
said were highest on the list of also-rans behind Souter. They were, in the 
White House's publicized order of preference, Circuit Court Judges Edith H. 
Jones, a Texan and a woman; Clarence Thomas, a black; and Laurence H. 
Silberman, a Jew -- all clearly in the conservative camp. 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic political consultant who looked at the list remarked, "They've got 
perfect positioning if they want to pick our coalition apart." What he meant 
was that if Bush gets the opportunity to make additional court appointments 
before 1992, he can force the Democrats either to acquiesce in moving the high 
court much further to the right -- or to pay an exceptionally high political 
price by challenging nominees from important constituencies.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
MAKE HER DAY -- TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today in Orange County, a homeless person is as likely to be a single mother 
with one or more children as to be a stereotypical bum. These families find 
themselves on the street in an area where rents are sky high and child- care 
costs can eat up a minimum-wage salary quicker than you can say "fast-food 
burger." 
</P>
<P>
The head of one of the county's biggest charities, Episcopal Service 
Alliance/South County, estimates that 30% of the 2,000 people who seek help at 
ESA are single mothers and their children. But there are very few shelters for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
No private agency -- and there are far too few of them, anyway -- can make a 
meaningful dent in this societal problem. But at least some are trying. A new 
one is Single Mothers in Partnership, a South County group that will attempt to 
bring these women together to help each other, and perhaps even to share 
housing. Also, some single mothers may be matched with senior citizens who have 
large enough homes -- and hearts -- to accommodate homeless families. The 
organization is holding its first event today in the basement of Mission San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 homeless in Orange County, and for all 
this has been a hard summer. That's partly because one of the largest 
charities, Share Our Selves, has been shut down. SOS is renovating new quarters 
in Costa Mesa after being evicted from its long-term home at Rea Community 
Center. It will reopen in September. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other poverty agencies are being inundated. Alarmed at the 
situation, United Way and the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force this 
week launched a summer emergency food and shelter campaign. The campaign's aims 
are ambitious: Raise $1 million, collect 500,000 pounds of food and enlist 
1,000 volunteers by mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting this effort is one of those things like apple pie and motherhood. It 
should be unquestioned.

HERE'S THE CATCH: RECEIVER ROSS LOVES PRESSURE SITUATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: CARSON STANDOUT WILL CLOSE OUT HIS HIGH SCHOOL CAREER IN SHRINE GAME. 
THEN HE WILL TRY TO SHOWCASE HIS TALENTS AT FRESNO STATE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Many athletes eventually succumb to the pressure of a game, but Michael Ross 
thrives on it. 
</P>
<P>
When Ross takes the field on Saturday for the Shrine All-Star Football Classic, 
he wants the pressure to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"I always put pressure on myself to do well in a game," Ross said. "It's like, 
'You have to come through Michael. If you don't come through, you've failed 
yourself.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I always feel the pressure of losing. If you don't fear the pressure and you 
don't fear losing, you're not human. You have to fear something. And when you 
come through that fear, it makes you feel like you've accomplished something 
big." 
</P>
<P>
The fear and the pressure have obviously paid off for the 6-foot-1, 170-pound 
wide receiver from Carson High. Ross, 17, shattered several Carson records in 
his senior season, setting career records for catches (80), yards receiving 
(1,527) and touchdowns (22). His season records include touchdowns (15), punt 
return yardage (382), and most yards receiving in a game (205). 
</P>
<P>
Carson has produced a bevy of outstanding wide receivers, including Wesley 
Walker of the New York Jets, Michael Wilson of the San Francisco 49ers and 
Derek Hill of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
According to several coaches in the area, Ross might be the next Carson alumnus 
to break into the NFL. But he must first prove himself at Fresno State. Ross 
will redshirt his freshman year because he failed to meet Proposition 48 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to lie, it (Fresno State) was a very big joke to me," Ross said, 
smiling. "I was like, 'Oh, Fresno State, I've never even heard of them.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I've only seen Fresno State on TV one time on Prime Ticket. They were playing 
at Bulldog Stadium. I flipped the station and looked and said, 'Oh man, this is 
one of those lightweight games.' I never thought I would be going there." 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who also considered offers from Cal State Long Beach and Nevada, Las 
Vegas, quickly changed his attitude when he found out about other receivers who 
had played at Fresno State, including Henry Ellard of the Rams, Stephone Paige 
of the Kansas City Chiefs, and Stephen Baker of the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"My eyes lit up when I heard that Henry Ellard went there because he is one of 
my idols," Ross said. "When I heard these guys (Ellard and Paige) came from 
Fresno I thought, my God, I'm being recruited by a big school." 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills Coach Jim Barnett, who is coaching the South squad in the Shrine 
Game and who coached Paige at Long Beach Poly in the late '70s, said there is 
no comparison between the two athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, Michael is a lot better than Stephone Paige was (coming out of 
high school)," Barnett said. "Paige was taller, but he didn't have the 
quickness and agility that Michael has. (Ross) is ready to play major college 
ball right now, where as Stephone was a late bloomer." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett is excited to have Ross as his No. 1 wideout. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a burning desire to catch the ball," Barnett said. "When that ball is 
in the air, he thinks it is his." 
</P>
<P>
Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle, who coached Ross for two years, echoes Barnett's 
sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"He runs excellent routes, reads the defense well and finds the seams," 
Vollnogle said. "He has great hands, great leaping ability and enjoys going 
across the middle. He is a complete football player." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle, the winningest prep coach in California history with a record of 
298-75-1, said that Ross has "adequate speed" and "bursts of speed," but his 
4.6 time in the 40-yard dash could be improved. 
</P>
<P>
"If he were an outright sprinter he would be unstoppable," he said. "But he's 
so good right now that that one deficiency doesn't show up much." 
</P>
<P>
Carson had a 24-3 record in Ross' two years. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who is among 32 players on the South team, has recently overcome the 
intimidation he felt when he arrived at the Shrine Game training camp at UC 
Irvine a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"A game like this was a dream for me," he said. "(But) I didn't know it would 
be called the Shrine Game and that it would be at the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Ross compares the Shrine Game to one of the biggest games of his life -- the 
1988 City Championship between Carson and Banning at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming down the tunnel, I didn't feel anything," he said. "Then I came out and 
saw that big scoreboard and all the people in the stands and I had to stop 
right there and catch my breath. I think I'm going to feel the same way when we 
jump into the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Ross caught his breath and overcame the pressure of that game to score two 
touchdowns in the Colts' 57-7 rout of Banning. 
</P>
<P>
"That 11th-grade year put me on the map," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ross certainly doesn't show any signs of letting up. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been rough times in the past and I got through them," he said. "So, 
the only thing I cannot get through is death. There are gonna be ups and downs, 
but you have to recover and keep on running because if you stop you're gonna 
lose the race."

<P>
Has Bo Kimble's success in a recent basketball-skills contest started a trend 
for younger aspirants. 
</P>
<P>
His winning of $100,000 in the one-day contest last month should certainly 
provide inspiration. But kids have been challenging one another with their 
individual basketball skills for as long as the game has been popular. There 
just haven't been too many organized contests for them to show off such 
talents. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
While the stakes will be considerably less than those that Kimble labored for, 
kids all over the Los Angeles area are entered in the "Punchy Sports Slam-Jam" 
this afternoon at 5 in the Westchester Recreation Center for boys and girls 
between the ages of 8 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
Skills being contested include free-throwing, spot-shooting (shooting from 
various parts of the court), speed dribbling and slam-dunking, in which contest 
organizers will lower the hoop from its regulation 10-foot height. 
</P>
<P>
The competition will be staged separately for boys and girls. They will be 
bracketed into age groups of 8-10, 11-12 and 13-14, with the height of the 
basket adjusted accordingly. Competitors must bring proof of age. 
</P>
<P>
Winners at the Westchester site and other area locations will compete Aug. 4 in 
a city championship at the Westwood Recreation Center. From there, the top 
performers in each event will vie against counterparts from eight other cities 
around the United States. Entry is free. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 670-7473 or (800) 776-7378. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Everywhere? -- Vacant tennis courts in Manhattan Beach are hard enough 
to come by during most summer weekends, and it will be even tougher this 
Saturday and Sunday with the Manhattan Tennis Open winding up. 
</P>
<P>
Competition is being held for men and women at least 16 years old in singles 
and doubles as well as mixed doubles, with awards going to top players in five 
different skill levels. The sole age-group category is doubles for men 55 and 
older. 
</P>
<P>
The Junior Manhattan Volleyball Open tournament for boys and girls up to the 
10th-grade, originally scheduled for this weekend at the Manhattan Beach pier, 
has been rescheduled for Aug.11-12. 
</P>
<P>
Information for both the tennis and volleyball tournaments: (213) 545-5621, 
Ext. 322. 
</P>
<P>
The Beat Goes On -- NBA rookies and hopefuls continue to audition for 
professional basketball contracts with the second weekend of the Southern 
California Summer Pro Basketball League at Albert Gersten Pavilion on the 
Loyola Marymount campus. Four games each day, starting at 11:15 a.m., will be 
played today, Saturday and Sunday. Admission is $5 per day. 
</P>
<P>
Racing fans can continue to follow any of three types -- bicycle, motorcycle or 
automobile -- in the South Bay this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Velodrome, next to the Cal State Dominguez Hills campus in Carson, hosts 
the Golden State Grand Prix series of bicycle racing tonight at 7:30, while 
Ascot Park in Gardena has the California Motorcycle Club competition tonight at 
7:30 and the California Racing Assn. sprint car competition Saturday at 8 p.m.

TRIATHLETES OF ALL AGES QUICKLY GET HOOKED ON THEIR SPORT'S RIGORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brad Kearns won the Oxnard Sports Festival triathlon Sunday and Charlie Gooding 
finished last, but they really aren't as far apart as it might seem. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Kearns, a former Taft High cross-country runner, has made a career of 
triathlons, spending his days running, swimming and bicycling in preparation 
for competition. Meanwhile, the Sunland-based Gooding must plan his training 
around his work schedule at a large computer firm. 
</P>
<P>
And although Kearns goes to triathlons wearing clothing donated by sponsors and 
anticipating big earnings from each event, Gooding, who puts his earnings from 
work toward purchasing bike equipment and wet suits, must leave the race course 
with nothing more than bolstered pride. 
</P>
<P>
"This was my second race. It was encouraging to see people at the end chanting 
my name, calling for me to finish," said Gooding, a 59-year-old grandfather of 
12. "The swimming part interested me and I decided to try this. The competition 
got me to try the training and be disciplined so I could do well. Now I am just 
glad that I finished." 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all that separates them, both Kearns, 25, and Gooding have centered 
their lives on the need for speed, strength and endurance. They, like many of 
the 700 other athletes who competed, admit to an almost unhealthy obsession 
with a sport that seems to welcome only the fittest, mentally and physically. 
</P>
<P>
"My advice to people when they start is to have fun with it and don't get too 
wrapped up with it," Kearns said after earning his 14th career win and a 
$10,000 prize. "A lot of people tend to get carried away and obsessed with this 
sport because it is such a tremendous challenge. The sport tends to attract an 
obsessive type, but it can just be fun having a little balance and coming here 
and doing your best." 
</P>
<P>
Competitors in the Oxnard race swam 1.5 kilometers, biked 40 kilometers and ran 
eight kilometers. Kearns finished in 1 hour 36 minutes 2 seconds. Paula 
Newby-Fraser, winner of the women's triathlon, completed the course in 1:48:25. 
</P>
<P>
But the best time is not the only definition of success for triathletes. 
</P>
<P>
"You are competing against yourself," said Mike Anton, a financial planner from 
Canoga Park who finished in the pack in the Oxnard race. "It is not a matter of 
competing against the people around you. It's really about trying to get better 
against yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Yet if a triathlete is to raise his level of competition, his free time becomes 
vital training time. Sometimes triathletes' single-mindedness stretches the 
patience of those closest to them. 
</P>
<P>
When Paula Archer of Chatsworth discovered triathlons, her life quickly 
changed. She quit her job as a drug counselor and became a sales manager at a 
bike store -- taking a pay cut -- to have more time to train. Her commitment to 
training caused her to lose touch with many friends. However, she built new 
friendships with other triathletes. 
</P>
<P>
Would she change a thing? 
</P>
<P>
"I've never regretted it," Archer said just after accepting a plaque for 
finishing sixth among women aged 25 to 29 at Oxnard. "I miss the money, but 
this is really worth it." 
</P>
<P>
People like triathlons for many reasons. For example, they are not as tedious 
as simply running. Moreover, triathletes can compete for as long as they are 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
The sport also is beginning to find a following. In the Commonwealth Games in 
New Zealand in January, an estimated 20,000-25,000 fans turned out to see the 
triathlon competition, the most spectators for any event. The Olympics might 
include a triathlon in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a large amount of lobbying going on right now to get a triathlon in 
the '92 Games," said Gary Scott, deputy director of Triathlon Federation USA. 
"Our U.S. triathlon federation has gained temporary admittance into the United 
States Olympic Committee pending the approval by the International Olympic 
Committee. We should know more after the IOC meets in Tokyo later this year. 
With IOC trying to cut down on the number of sports, and other sports applying 
to gain entry, I would say our chances are 50-50." 
</P>
<P>
Southern California has been the mecca for triathletes, but that is changing. 
Like many career triathletes making their way to higher altitudes, at which 
training is more rigorous, former Woodland Hills resident Andrew MacNaughton 
has moved to Boulder, Colo., to train. Nevertheless, the heart of the sport is 
still here. Both Kearns and MacNaughton believe that the Valley is an ideal 
place for a beginning triathlete. 
</P>
<P>
"The Valley is conducive to training," said MacNaughton, who works out with 
Kearns. "There is pretty good weather all year 'round. There are probably only 
10 to 30 days a year when it is bad to train. I like training there. There are 
nice hills and nice flats to run on. It's a good place to start." 
</P>
<P>
Candice Cutrosky, a 21-year-old student at Cal State Northridge, is proving 
that to be true. She began training only a year ago but appears to be one of 
the sport's future stars. She won the women's 20-24 age group at Oxnard in 
1:57:04 and was the second-highest-placing amateur woman. Her time would have 
placed her seventh in the professional competition. Cutrosky has qualified for 
the sport's premier event, the Bud Light Ironman Triathlon in Kailua-Kona, 
Hawaii, in October but said that she probably will not attend. 
</P>
<P>
"I have trained hard this year, and I have put everything aside. All my friends 
and everything," Cutrosky said. "It has been just school and training. I've met 
so many new friends doing this, which is just great. I also like to push myself 
and see how far I can push my body. This is such a life style. I will turn pro 
next year -- I don't want to go to the Ironman yet -- but next year will be 
better." 
</P>
<P>
But it is a misconception to believe that youth is a prerequisite for a 
triathlete. Granada Hills resident Joe Marino, 59, learned to swim last year 
and to bicycle three years ago. Marino placed third in his age group at Oxnard, 
finishing the race in 2:14:19. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns said that age should not inhibit a potential triathlete. 
</P>
<P>
"You peak in this sport at around 32," he said. "Dave Scott won the Ironman 
competition six times, and he is still doing well and he is 35. Scott Tinley 
(who finished second at Oxnard) is 33. I think that is when you begin to come 
on and feel the strength. You can keep competitive until you are almost 40. 
There are guys coming in who are 70 years old looking for a way to stay 
healthy. This is a lifetime sport." 
</P>
<P>
There are reasons to believe interest in the triathlon is peaking. The hours of 
training make it difficult for most people to dedicate themselves, and there is 
no place for a casual triathlete. 
</P>
<P>
The sport continues to grow, but not at the skyrocketing pace of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not the incredible growth of a few years ago, but it is far from 
stagnating," Gary Scott said. "That can be seen when you look at the number of 
participants, the success of cross-training products, and the number of races 
across the country is still increasing. It is still growing." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the future of the sport really can't be measured by the success of the 
Newby-Frasers and the Kearns. It is the Charlie Goodings who will determine its 
lasting power.

CAMARILLO'S BATTERS LEAVE FOE BATTERED; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN LEGION: DISTRICT 16 CHAMPION'S HIT AND RUN TOTALS MATCH IN 17-8 
FIRST-ROUND WIN OVER CULVER CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
After a day that featured more hits than a title fight, one had to wonder if 
this was the American Legion 6th Area baseball tournament or Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's clubbers provided much of the doubt in the six-team tournament at 
UCLA's Jackie Robinson Field. Camarillo, which entered the contest with a .370 
batting average, battered two Culver City pitchers for 17 hits in a 17-8 win 
that lasted 3 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo (21-3) will meet Claremont in a second-round game at 4 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Hits were everywhere but on the concession stand's menu Thursday. Four teams 
combined for 60 in earlier games, and Camarillo and Culver City accounted for 
an additional 26. The 86 hits in three games average out to nearly 30 a game 
and 15 per team. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's display left even its coach impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say this, but I'm surprised at the way we swung the bat after such a 
long layoff," Coach Gary Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
The District 16 champion last played Sunday. But it looked anything but rusty 
against Pepperdine-bound Mauricio Estavil and Brigham Young-bound John Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Estavil (6-1), a Culver City High left-hander who was the Ocean League's most 
valuable player, could not finish what he had started. He was tagged for seven 
runs and six hits in just three innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have his usual stuff," Culver City Coach John Brasher said. "But 
Camarillo can hit the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo, which averages eight runs and 10 hits a game, benefited from 
pitching coach Rick Torres' instruction. Torres, a former Santa Clara High 
left-hander who pitched at USC from 1985-89, tossed batting practice Wednesday 
to prepare Camarillo for Estavil. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it helped them," Torres said. "But we're a good hitting team anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo established that fact early. Tim Cornish's single in the first gave 
Camarillo a 1-0 lead. The advantage grew to 4-0 in the second on Corey Tucker's 
two-run double and Danny Haas' run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo added three runs in the third to take a 7-0 lead, and scored six in 
the fourth. The big blows in the fourth were Kwinn Knight's two-run single and 
Tucker's three-run double. Tucker, batting eighth in the order and hitting just 
.235 with seven runs batted in entering the game, drove in five runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We said before the game that we needed somebody to pick us up, and that was 
Corey Tucker tonight," Wagner said. "That's just what we needed."

<P>
Culver City (12-2), which had a 12-game winning streak snapped, chipped at 
Camarillo's lead. Culver City scored five runs off Haas (7-0) and added two 
runs off reliever Garth Teron to cut its deficit to 13-7. 
</P>
<P>
But Camarillo responded once again. Mike Muncy's run-scoring single in the 
eighth extended the lead to 14-7, and Camarillo added three runs in the ninth. 
Matt Tackett's second double drove in two runs and Mike Mitchell drove in the 
final run with a single. 
</P>
<P>
Each Camarillo starter had at least one hit, and Haas -- batting ninth -- was 
three for three. Tucker, Tackett, Knight, Cornish, Mitchell and Kasha Clemons 
each had two hits. Tackett drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the offensive display, Camarillo also was talking about its defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids swing the bat, but we play exceptional defense too," Torres said. 
"Defense is what separates us from other good teams." 
</P>
<P>
Culver City, the District 24 champion, will meet Conejo Valley today at 12:30 
p.m.

ALL-STARS TO FIGHT FOR A CAUSE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: AREA PAIR TO PLAY FOR SOUTH TEAM SATURDAY IN ANNUAL SHRINE GAME AT 
ROSE BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Rudisill has just one wish for this year's Shrine high school all-star 
football game: Let it have a different ending than the previous all-star game 
in which he played. 
</P>
<P>
Rudisill starred as a defensive back and a running back at Thousand Oaks High 
and earned a scholarship to San Diego State and invitations to two high school 
all-star games this summer. He is one of two area players named to the South 
team in Saturday's 39th annual game, scheduled for a 6 p.m. kickoff at the Rose 
Bowl. Former Montclair Prep running back Mike Jones, who has signed with USC, 
is the area's other representative. 
</P>
<P>
Rudisill played for the East in the Ventura County Lions &amp; Coaches all-star 
game last month at Thousand Oaks High. For 2 1/2 quarters, the game was 
everything he had expected. He enjoyed the return to football and relished 
being treated as an all-star in front of his hometown fans. 
</P>
<P>
But the game was stopped after a brawl erupted in front of the West bench with 
the East holding a 21-6 lead. Fights broke out among players for the next 10 
minutes, and when officials and four security guards were unable to end the 
fighting, the game was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Three Ventura County Sheriff's Department vehicles were dispatched to the field 
and authorities escorted players from the parking lot. Afterward, organizers 
rejected calls to discontinue the series. 
</P>
<P>
Rudisill sensed that trouble was brewing even before the kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
"You could tell right from the warm-ups that something was going to happen," he 
said. "Guys were talking back and forth, saying things you can't put in the 
paper. There was something in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Rudisill agreed with the decision to call the game but faulted officials for 
failing to call more penalties earlier. Of the four penalties called in the 
game, one was a personal foul. 
</P>
<P>
"There were scuffles going on everywhere, so I guess they did the right thing 
when they stopped it," he said. "More fights would have broken out. The refs 
could have prevented it if they called more penalties earlier." 
</P>
<P>
The prestige of the Shrine game and the cause it serves will prevent any 
violence in Saturday's game, Rudisill said. The game is the most prestigious in 
the state for recently graduated seniors and serves as a fund-raiser for the 
Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children in Los Angeles. In the 10 days before 
each year's game, players visit stricken children in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're picked for the Shrine game, that's the highest honor you can get," 
he said. "I think everyone will be on their best behavior. The game has a 
purpose, so I don't think fights will break out and ruin the image of the 
Shriners." 
</P>
<P>
Player behavior has never been a problem, according to game director Bob 
Belyeu, who has been associated with the event since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are pretty level-headed and just too classy for that," he said. "Of 
the 60 kids, 27 of them have grade-point averages of 3.5 or better. Plus, when 
they go through the hospital doors and see those poor kids, they realize what 
this game is played for and they get a sense of purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Rudisill rushed for 398 yards at Thousand Oaks in '89 but earned his 
scholarship as a defender. The 6-foot, 185-pound defensive back intercepted 
five passes and contributed to what Thousand Oaks Coach Bob Richards called the 
best defense in school history. Thousand Oaks (11-1-1) reached the semifinal 
round of the Southern Section Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also helped his team get to the playoff semifinals, leading Montclair 
Prep to a 12-1 record in Division IX. He rushed for 1,743 yards in 224 carries 
and scored 21 touchdowns.

PARKINSON INJURES KNEE AGAIN DURING DRILL WITH BRONCOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brent Parkinson, a former Canyon High standout who sustained two knee injuries 
during his collegiate football career at USC, suffered an injury to his left 
knee Thursday during the Denver Broncos' afternoon practice in Greeley, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it could be a partially torn cartilage," Coach Dan Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
"It immediately started swelling on him. He'll be tested in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you get somebody hurt, it's a concern. We felt Brent was a tremendous 
prospect. We had high hopes for him. We had just moved him to right tackle 
(behind starter Ken Lanier), and he's a good snapper. I hope it's not serious." 
</P>
<P>
The injury occurred as Parkinson was blocking for a running play during a 
non-tackling drill. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson, a rookie free agent, had surgery on his left knee in 1988 to repair 
the cruciate ligament and described that injury as his most serious. 
</P>
<P>
On the sixth play of this year's Rose Bowl game, Parkinson sustained a ligament 
strain to his right knee, which kept him out of the rest of the game. That 
injury did not require surgery. STEVEN HERBERT

CZECH BOUNCING BACK IN TRIATHLON DESPITE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jaro Snopek's definition of happiness might seem a bit strange, but when one 
comes from pre-revolutionary Czechoslovakia, rows of canned peas can look more 
appealing than the most pristine beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Going to grocery store is like paradise here," Snopek said. "It's so 
different." 
</P>
<P>
Snopek has encountered a world of difference in the triathlon as well. In 1987, 
ranked among the top five triathletes in Czechoslovakia, Snopek left his 
homeland, eventually arriving in the United States two years later. He 
immediately found the triathlon competition in a free-market nation much 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in Sunday's Oxnard Sports Festival triathlon, Snopek's 1-hour, 
54-minute effort left him 18 minutes behind the winner -- six minutes behind 
the first woman finisher. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much harder now to be among the top. It is a very popular sport here," 
Snopek said. "It is my dream to be on top, but now I am a little discouraged. 
You need a lot of time for training and you need time to work. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very hard to combine this. The triathlon takes a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
Snopek, who has lived in Chatsworth since his arrival in the United States, 
works as a lifeguard in Santa Monica. Partly because of that, the swim portion 
of his race is usually among his strongest. 
</P>
<P>
"I get to bike and swim every day, so I am strong in those events," Snopek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This despite the fact that he doesn't have a wet suit -- they aren't 
manufactured in Czechoslovakia -- and didn't have ready access to a good 
bicycle until moving to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"In Czechoslovakia, it was so hard for the people to buy a bike or to get 
equipment," he said. "If you want to be good, you need good equipment. I 
improved my time when I came here, just because I had better equipment." 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps, because he is getting caught up in the spirit of competition that 
he finds so prevalent here. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans are like kids, they just love this and it is like a game for them," 
he said. "I like that."

DOW OFF 10.15 ON NEWS OF FIRMS' WEAK PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weak corporate earnings and a general malaise pushed stocks lower Thursday, 
ending a frail attempt at a midweek rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 10.15 to 2,920.79. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues held a slight edge on advances in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 701 up, 778 down and 524 unchanged. Big 
Board volume was a moderate 155.04 million shares, down from Wednesday's 163.53 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The decline snapped a two-day rebound after Monday's 56-point drop in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
Investors remained wary amid a fresh round of earnings disappointments, and 
weakness in technology, tobacco and energy stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Computer-driven sell programs also pushed stocks lower, though they rose off 
their lows in late-session bargain hunting. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just the continuation of a shakeout from Monday," said Robert Walberg, 
an analyst at MMS International. Gains in the prior two sessions were "minimal 
and on light volume. We definitely had some futures selling, but the weakness 
seemed to be confined to autos, oil and high tech." 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, the big computer software maker, said it expects lower profit 
margins in 1991. The announcement "put a negative bent on high-tech stocks," 
Walberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the market was overreacting to earnings reports. But 
earnings aside, investors are keeping an eye on the ongoing budget-deficit 
negotiations, which could stretch into August. The White House said President 
Bush may ask Congress to stay in session next month to cut the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Microsoft slid 2 3/4 to 68 3/4 after its statement on profit margins. Other 
computer stocks also fell. IBM lost 1 5/8 to 113 1/8, Apple Computer slipped 
7/8 to 41 3/8 and Cray Research fell 1 1/8 to 43 7/8. Compaq, which reported 
second-quarter earnings within the range of analysts' estimates, fell 1 1/2 to 
57 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Eli Lilly tumbled 4 3/8 to 79 5/8. A second lawsuit was filed over alleged 
side effects of the firm's antidepressant drug Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
* Tobacco stocks dropped after the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that warning 
labels mandated by federal law do not preempt failure-to-warn or liability 
claims. Philip Morris fell 1 3/4 to 47 1/4, Loews Corp. lost 2 1/4 to 105 1/2 
and American Brands slipped 3 3/8 to 66 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Weak energy stocks included Arco, off 1 5/8 to 124 1/8; Chevron, off 3/4 to 
77, and Mobil, down 1 to 65. 
</P>
<P>
* Many biotech stocks continued to surge, including Amgen, up 1 to 91 1/2; 
Immunex, up 2 3/8 to 35, and Cytogen, up 2 3/4 to 41. 
</P>
<P>
* Delta Air Lines slipped 1 1/2 to 65 7/8 after it reported 
weaker-than-expected profit. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices also ended sharply lower on London's Stock Exchange, with the 
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index down 20.6 points at 2,344.1. 
However, in Frankfurt, shares ended broadly higher, as strong buying of 
selected blue chips helped prices rise across the board. The 30-share DAX index 
ended 12.64 points higher at 1,932.89.

Bond Prices Close Nearly Unchanged 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were virtually unchanged in lethargic trading as the market waited 
for progress on the federal budget and for today's release of gross national 
product figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended the day unchanged, as did its 
yield, which stood at 8.54%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders were unwilling to make any major moves while they wait 
for congressional and White House negotiators to agree on $50 billion in budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8%, unchanged from late Wednesday.

Dollar Ends Mixed, Gains Against Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen but finished mixed against most other 
major currencies in seesaw trading. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar got a boost initially in Tokyo when traders began selling yen, which 
lost ground across the board. Analysts said investors remain concerned about 
recent stock market swings in Tokyo as well as uncertainty over whether the 
Bank of Japan will move to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates in Japan would tend to support the yen. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Morrissey, senior trader at the Bank of Boston's New York office, said 
there were rumors that the Federal Reserve had entered the market to sell 
dollars and buy yen in an effort to stem the dollar's rise. But those rumors 
were not confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.98 yen to a closing 150.11 yen. Later, in London, 
it was quoted at 150.10 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 150.35 yen, up 
from 149.83 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8133 from $1.8125 late Wednesday. In 
New York, it cost $1.8145 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's 
$1.8120.

Soviet Rumors Spur Soybean Price Rally 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures prices surged in a rally fueled by perceptions that the Soviet 
Union is shopping for soybean meal after a months-long absence from world 
commodity markets. 
</P>
<P>
Grain futures ended mostly higher as bullish enthusiasm spread from the soybean 
pits to the nearby wheat, corn and oat rings. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, gasoline futures rose sharply; copper extended 
recent gains; precious metals were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures settled 7 to 12 cents higher in Chicago, with the contract for 
delivery in August at $5.92 1/2 a bushel. Soybean meal futures settled 80 cents 
to $4 higher, with August at $171.10 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures ended unchanged to 1.5 cents higher, with September at $3.0175 a 
bushel.

Tokyo stocks were down sharply at midday Friday in moderately active trading, 
on widespread selling due to concerns about a weaker yen and possible higher 
interest rates.

<P>
But stocks had rebounded from their lows after a late buying binge by new 
investment trust funds, traders said.

The key 225-share Nikkei index was down 744.94 points, or 2.4%, to 30,624.81 at

PEOPLE: EX-BOFA CHIEF ARMACOST GOES TO WEISS PECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Samuel Armacost, who resigned under fire as chief executive of BankAmerica 
Corp. during its darkest days in the 1980s, has joined the investment firm of 
Weiss Peck &amp; Greer as a general partner and a member of the firm's 
management committee. 
</P>
<P>
Armacost, 51, most recently was a managing director of Merrill Lynch Capital 
Markets in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Before that he was president and chief executive of BankAmerica, but was forced 
out after the San Francisco-based bank suffered massive losses and nearly 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
At Weiss Peck, Armacost will be principally involved in the investment 
management and management buyout areas. He will be based in the firm's San 
Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Greer, a partner of Weiss Peck, said the firm "is a perfect outlet for 
Sam Armacost's management and entrepreneurial skills. His considerable talent, 
experience and reputation will add significant value." 
</P>
<P>
"I am excited about the prospect of becoming a partner of a private, highly 
focused entrepreneurial firm," Armacost said in a statement.

BEHIND THE WHEEL / BMW 318IS: BEAMED DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Entry level. It can be a job in the mail room, well whiskey or a polyester 
dinner jacket. On the other hand, there are small condominiums in East Beverly 
Hills, diamond chip earrings and a Rolls-Royce for a frugal $140,000 that 
clearly qualify as starter sets. 
</P>
<P>
Place BMW's new 318is in the latter category. 
</P>
<P>
It is a quality primer to the big buck adventure and a product made affordable 
by gentle defrilling more than drastic stripping. 
</P>
<P>
It is inexpensive, not cheap. 
</P>
<P>
And this beginner Beamer also represents an entry level of design, engineering, 
material and performance that actually is superior to the middle drawer of many 
other marques. 
</P>
<P>
Less luxury for a reduced sticker shock, of course, is the mode of today's 
five-star motoring. 
</P>
<P>
There is a little Lexus and a mini Infiniti. Jaguar has introduced an XJ6 with 
a sticker of $39,700. Mercedes, Range Rover and even Bentley are making 
moderate models to catch young buyers, who, the marketing logic goes, will 
evolve into a senior and more expansive clientele. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that the market (for cars) between $20,000 and $25,000 is very 
important," said Christoph Huss, products manager for BMW of North America Inc. 
of Woodcliff Lake, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to a dwindling dollar and rising costs, he explained, BMW's base 
car, the 325i introduced five years ago, had become a $24,650 proposition. "And 
that price . . . is too high for the first-time BMW customer." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the six-cylinder 325 couldn't be made for less. The obvious answer was to 
build a more attainable BMW that wasn't quite so much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
"The new 318is comes with aluminum wheels, an anti-lock braking system, air 
bag, a 16-valve engine, sport seats . . . and this is not a stripped car by any 
means," Huss continued. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, no. It also arrives with power steering, power windows, electric 
mirrors and central locking as standard equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"But we've lowered the cost by going to a four-cylinder engine, less expensive 
tires, less equipment in the stereo system, no automatic and less noise 
reduction," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Leather upholstery, electric sun roof, heated seats, a CD player, a telephone 
and a ski sack are not available as options. "So one dollar by one dollar, the 
cost comes down." 
</P>
<P>
And down it has come until a paid-up membership in the tasteful, somewhat 
exclusive BMW club has been reduced to $21,500 -- with a four-door and less 
sporty 318i down to only $19,900. That's far less than Acura Legend, Audi 
Quattro, Mercedes 190, Taurus SHO and other purposeful coupes. 
</P>
<P>
BMW's only task now is to persuade buyers that this 318i is a considerable 
improvement on that 318i that came and went in the early '80s. The 1983 version 
was very much to BMW what the 912 and 924 were to Porsche -- underpowered 
pretenders that offended purists and achieved little beyond thinning the 
bloodline. 
</P>
<P>
Burying this past, however, shouldn't be too difficult. 
</P>
<P>
BMW is off to a fast start with promotional literature that virtually ignores 
the old blot while billing the new 318i as "a lineal descendant of the car that 
first put BMW on the map for American enthusiasts: the unforgettable 2002 of 
1968." 
</P>
<P>
Seeing and driving the new car will scatter remaining doubts. This is indeed a 
better Beamer. And although the 318is doesn't offer quite the pep and mischief 
(to say nothing of the gentle warmth of remembering first loves) of the 2002, 
it certainly has earned the right to wear BMW's blue-and-white roundel. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the numbers on the rear deck, the exterior of the 318is is virtually 
indistinguishable from the more powerful and more expensive 325is. Even to 
dealers' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
All the classicism is there in the car's cross-spoke alloy wheels, body-color 
mirrors and a matte black belt line accenting the pleasantly softened boxiness 
that is as much a BMW trademark as the double kidney grille. It is traditional 
styling that barely changes between generations. But when it does, the movement 
is perfect. 
</P>
<P>
The only discord with the 318is (as indeed with the 325is) is in the front air 
dam. It drops beneath the lower line of the car, and, in profile, seems to hang 
down and flap like King Tut's beard. 
</P>
<P>
BMW's heftiest economy, of course, was earned in the engine bay where the 325's 
2.5 liter, 168 horsepower, six-cylinder engine was replaced by a 1.8 liter 
four-banger. 
</P>
<P>
It is smaller and thriftier. Yet it also is a multivalve engine with a bore 
identical to BMW's bigger engines -- and producing 134 horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
That will earn the car no medals for on-ramp drag racing. From dead stop, a 
Buick Reatta and a Honda Accord are quicker to 60 m.p.h. At the top end, a 
Toyota Cressida and even the Cadillac Allante are a little faster. Mid-range 
acceleration of the 318s is well up to the response and pace expected of 
contemporary performance sedans -- but only exhilarating when hitting just the 
right gear at the most productive point of the power curve. 
</P>
<P>
It is the BMW's handling, however, that has always separated the mundane from 
the Bavarian. 
</P>
<P>
It is neither stiff nor sloppy. The car doesn't exactly roll or flatten down in 
an interesting corner either. Yet whether turning in or steering out, coasting 
along or thundering through a corner, the machine is just so darned reliable, 
consistent and agreeable. Like an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
The nickel betting window is now open. 
</P>
<P>
The only gear shift smoother than that on a 318is is one that isn't connected 
to a gear box t all. Spacing of the gears is about as perfect as a 
hand-stitched buttonhole. The car's disc brakes -- evaluated through pedal 
effort, control, and introduction of the anti-lock system -- feel as though all 
their components were supplied by the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Wanna bet? 
</P>
<P>
The interior of the car is a high combination of purpose, comfort and style 
typical of the Teutons. Ready to serve. Safe coloring. Everything where it 
should be. More visibility than a wide-angle lens. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a pair of sport seats with gentle kidney cuddlers, perfect adjustment 
permutations and even a bar for reducing the lower thigh tensions of 
long-distance touring. 
</P>
<P>
If such seats could be adapted into chairs for residential use, 75 million 
Americans would have more peaceful sacroiliacs. 
</P>
<P>
This is a pleasant, very agreeable car. It is far from dramatic and there are 
faster, more comfortable, higher value and better-equipped BMWs. 
</P>
<P>
Ergo, the 318is is no ultimate driving machine. 
</P>
<P>
Except among entry levelers and the level-headed.

A SOLID CASE; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: 'PRESUMED INNOCENT' BRILLIANTLY CAPTURES THE NOVEL'S ESSENCE, AND 
FEATURES A TOUR DE FORCE PERFORMANCE FROM HARRISON FORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Intelligent, complex and enthralling, "Presumed Innocent" (citywide) is one of 
those rare films where all the players seem to be in a state of grace, where 
the working of the machinery never shows and after it's over, one runs and 
reruns its intricacies with a profound sense of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
In his original novel, Scott Turow, a prosecuting attorney himself, worked from 
a fascinating hypothesis: Rusty Sabich (Harrison Ford), a respected Midwestern 
prosecuting attorney, a man solidly wedded to the law and its principles, 
suddenly gets a reverse view of its workings when he becomes a suspect in the 
lurid sex murder of a colleague with whom he had had a torrid affair. 
</P>
<P>
Turow's fans will be pleased to know that Frank Pierson and the film's 
director, Alan J. Pakula, have made an uncommonly sensitive adaptation of 
what's been called a bullet train of a book. Their changes in Turow's vividly 
detailed novel are smart; if in the process interesting but non-essential 
characters have been erased, if a certain depth has been stripped from a 
central character and an endangered marriage has been set on its feet again, 
this is, after all, the idealized world of movies. Streamlining 
notwithstanding, the book's essence remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, no reader is going to quibble that the novel's coolly ambitious 
prosecutor Carolyn Polhemus has dropped a dozen or so years and a teen-age son 
to become Greta Scacchi -- not when that actress' measured glance and 
apricot-colored skin could spark lust from granite. Scacchi's time onscreen is 
relatively brief but Gordon Willis, the film's great cinematographer, has 
summed up her impact in one ravishingly beautiful shot. As Carolyn gazes 
steadily at the camera, the look Willis catches is unguarded, unambiguous lust, 
a tool she wields with intensity -- and ambition -- enough to cause shock waves 
in even a marriage as seemingly secure as the Sabiches'. 
</P>
<P>
"Presumed Innocent" looks properly rich and Midwestern, one wouldn't be wrong 
to take its hypothetical Kindle County for Illinois' once famously corrupt Cook 
County, where author Turow has practiced law. Its extremes are summed up for us 
succinctly: the linen-wallpapered suites of the high-end lawyers and the 
crowded prosecutors' digs with all the charm of a welfare office; the suave 
intelligence of Raul Julia's defense attorney Alejandro "Sandy" Stern, and the 
too-sharp tailoring and ferrety air of Joe Grifasi's Tommy Molto, out to nail 
Sabich. 
</P>
<P>
The film's best actors are a formidable lot; Paul Winfield, whose complex 
judge, Larren Lyttle, is invested with a rumbling humor as well as power; John 
Spencer's quintessential detective, Lipranzer, that "scholar of the underlife," 
and Bonnie Bedelia's, deeply sensitive work as Barbara Sabich, the wife 
painfully damaged by her husband's infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner "Painless" Kumagai becomes unforgettable at the hands of Sab Shimono, 
and Brian Dennehy is Sabich's longtime boss, whose every maneuver has a 
far-reaching political meaning. (With all the film's technical perfection, 
however, it's unclear why Dennehy seems to have spray-on spot lifter whitening 
his hair.) 
</P>
<P>
In what is almost his signature feat ("All the President's Men," "Sophie's 
Choice"), director Pakula has kept his cast of bravura actors in miraculous 
balance; none of them is allowed to pull the fabric of the whole out of shape. 
There is one performance so self-effacing, however, that it may get overlooked 
among all the high-wire acts: Ford's Rusty Sabich. 
</P>
<P>
Builders would recognize Ford's role for what it is, a bearing beam of a part; 
one which every other character in the film builds on. Yet -- after his 
roller-coaster affair with Scacchi is launched -- most of Ford's time is spent 
reacting. He must react in the courtroom; react to the story's shocks and 
surprises and, in the film's crucial scene, his unspoken reaction tells us more 
clearly than dialogue what Sabich lives by, his guilts, his doubts and his 
loyalties. 
</P>
<P>
Ford conveys this with the sort of deceptive economy that was part of Henry 
Fonda's sleight of hand. In fact, more than any other home-grown actor, Ford 
seems the logical choice to take over Fonda's niche as the decent American, 
which makes the dimensions of his moral anguish here all the more fascinating. 
If there are moviegoers who still think that Harrison Ford is most himself in 
an action role, "Presumed Innocent" (rated R for its nudity, sexuality and 
language) should go a long way toward clearing up that misconception.

INTO THE TERROR IN 'WHIRLWIND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine a crowd of women, their ravaged faces pressed like hungry children 
against the metal fencing of a prison yard, staring in devastation at 
unattainable freedom on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
That is the closing image of the Sovremennik Theatre of Moscow's "Into the 
Whirlwind," and it's hard to forget. Adapted by Alexander Getman and staged by 
the company's artistic director, Galina Volchek, in the Bagley-Wright Theatre 
of the Seattle Center, "Whirlwind" is a co-presentation of the Intiman Theatre 
and One Reel, producers of the Goodwill Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
This issue-driven piece, based on the chilling first half of Eugenia Semyonovna 
Ginzburg's memoirs of 18 years in Stalinist prisons, is the theatrical 
centerpiece of this festival. Like so many other political hot potatoes, it had 
been banned in the Soviet Union until glasnost relaxed the rules and the 
Sovremennik was able to commission the adaptation and put it before the public 
in February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
What comes across clearly in the telling of this tale of systematic and 
dehumanizing punishment, is the smoldering passion of artists suddenly free to 
express pent-up indignation and rage. It is Russians pointing horrified fingers 
at Russians in their own immediate past -- and vowing that such history must 
not repeat itself. 
</P>
<P>
Ginzburg's nightmare was one of thousands that happened in a particularly 
frenzied period of political purging in the '30s and '40s. She was a professor 
who had the misfortune of praising publication of the wrong book by a colleague 
and who became one more guiltless target of Stalinist paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
Her true story reads like a bad novel. It is a series of horrific events from 
the moment, in 1934, when she became suspect (even though married to a leading 
member of the Tartar Province Committee of the Communist Party) to the time of 
her incarceration in Kazan three years later, and her mental and physical 
torment over the next 18 years -- through imprisonment, deprivation, 
interrogation, torture, disease and the Gulag. 
</P>
<P>
Ginzburg, who died in 1977, did not live to see her book published in the 
U.S.S.R., let alone performed on stage. But she might have approved of what the 
Sovremennik has achieved, re-creating not so much the events as their 
psychological implications and damage. If we know that a dramatization can only 
inspire outrage, there is always the danger that it will be robbed of its 
drama. It is theater for the already-converted. But the combination of 
articulate acting and Volchek's swiftly-paced direction, supported by a sound 
score of metal clanging and grinding against metal (to the amplified screams of 
torture), plunges us viscerally into the terror. This is not a play you just 
watch, but a play you experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Whirlwind" is performed in Russian, with subdued simultaneous translation over 
headsets -- an imperfect but satisfactory arrangement. Marina Neyolova plays 
Ginzburg in a performance of gradual but calamitous deterioration. This is a 
woman who simply couldn't take the easy way out, not from a pretentious sense 
of personal integrity, she protests, but out of an incapacity to falsify her 
behavior. She wonders what might have happened if the torture had become more 
intense. But it apparently did not and the journey remains one of spiraling, 
anguished decline into her own personal whirlwind. 
</P>
<P>
When the play closes with the announcement that these women will trade a prison 
for a labor camp in Siberia, a kind of frantic joy busts out all over. It means 
surrendering the stench and dankness of the cells for the great outdoors, icy 
or not. The stage is suddenly bathed in light and these women rush forward to 
embrace the limited promise of freedom, only to have the gates slam in their 
faces and their hope fade with the lights. 
</P>
<P>
It is an indelible image. 
</P>
<P>
The unsettling lighting design and armored environment of Mikhail Frankel's set 
contribute greatly: Everything threatens, confines and restricts, making the 
moment of false hope at the end all the more shocking for having been illusory. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Volchek's ability to reproduce the psychological disintegration so 
palpable in the book that makes this "Whirlwind" affecting. She re-creates the 
sense of a society devouring itself in an orgy of accusation and recrimination, 
fostering a form of emotional cannibalism. The irrationality is all the more 
horrifying for being explainable. As with the Maly Theatre of Leningrad's 
"Brothers and Sisters," seen at the Old Globe last fall, we are invited to 
watch the breakdown of reason and note how quickly it can spread. 
</P>
<P>
An unusual dimension of "Into the Whirlwind" is its all-female component of 
prisoners. The interaction among them cuts deeply into issues of motherhood and 
sisterhood (though oddly enough, not rape or sex). A silent member of this cast 
is 83-year-old Paulina Myashnikova, Ginzburg's friend and cellmate during some 
of her ordeal. Myashnikova's presence is a testament to its reality. 
</P>
<P>
Such an element of theatre-verite in a decidedly non-realistic presentation 
seems to be part of the Sovremennik's effort to continue to define itself as a 
theater on the cutting edge. Sovremennik (meaning "contemporary") was founded 
in 1956 -- coincidentally, the year Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin's purges 
at the 20th Party Congress -- and it has had Volchek as artistic director since 
1972. If it gives in to mild sensationalism now and then, it is in the pursuit 
of passionate issues. This is not a company that preaches. It puts its audience 
through the play -- no matter how uncomfortably. The more so, the better.

Christie's Record Sales: Despite strong indications that the overheated art 
market has encountered a big chill, Christie's overall sales have hit a new 
high. 
</P>
<P>
The London-based auction house's worldwide sales for the 1989-90 season 
totalled $2.376 billion, a 40% increase over the previous year's total of $1.78 
billion. Weak sales in some areas were outweighed by such record highs as the 
$82.5-million sale of Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet." Christie's 
sold 247 works of art for more than $1 million apiece in 1989-90. Of those, 41 
commanded more than $5 million apiece and 14 brought more than $10 million 
each. BETH KLEID

Lee and Scorsese Do the Right Thing: Film directors Martin Scorsese and Spike 
Lee have teamed up on a new government advertising campaign that sends 
teen-agers the message: Drug use can lead to unsafe sexual behavior and AIDS. 
The television ads were directed by Scorsese and narrated by Lee. 
</P>
<P>
The television, radio and print campaign focuses on people ages 12-16, a 
segment of the population who are "using alcohol and illicit drugs and often 
engage in sexual activity while under the influence of these substances," said 
Charles Schuster, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the agency 
sponsoring the $3-million public service campaign. The message found in the 
ads' tag line: "AIDS. Another way drugs can kill." BETH KLEID

Born in the U.S.A.: The girlfriend of Bruce Springsteen has given birth to the 
rock balladeer's first child -- a boy -- Springsteen's lawyer said Thursday. 
Patti Scialfa, 38, a back-up singer in Springsteen's band, delivered the 
7-pound, 9-ounce boy at an undisclosed California hospital sometime since 
Tuesday, said lawyer Barry Slott of Asbury Park, N.J. Slott did not know the 
boy's name, the name of the hospital or the condition of the mother or child.

A Teen-Ager in Love? Doo-wop singer Dion is challenging a request that he 
undergo blood testing in a paternity suit filed by an air conditioner repairman 
claiming to be his son from a youthful romance, an attorney in West Palm Beach, 
Fla., said Thursday. Palm Beach County Judge John Phillips heard the request 
Wednesday and was expected to rule by today. 
</P>
<P>
Dion Ambrogio, 33, said his mother, Gail Schweitzer, told him when he turned 18 
that he was the son of singer Dion Dimucci. Dimucci, who uses only his first 
name Dion, had a string of hits in the late 1950s with Dion and the Belmonts, 
including "A Teen-ager in Love" and "Where or When." The singer, who is 
married, lives in Boca Raton. BETH KLEID

A RARE SHOW BY RECLUSIVE VIJA CELMINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Everything else is moving -- I think art ought to be still," says Vija 
Celmins, whose work seems frozen in a state of suspended animation. Precise 
renderings of the ocean, the desert floor and the heavens, her work feels keyed 
up with compression and tension. Mostly, however, it feels exquisitely sad. One 
senses the isolation and intense concentration that goes into these drawings, 
and one also feels the violence that threatens to disrupt the rigid control 
central to Celmins' style. 
</P>
<P>
Often mistakenly described as a Pop artist, a Photo-Realist, a Surrealist or a 
Conceptualist, Celmins actually conforms to none of those schools. Reclusive 
and not too prolific, she has never concerned herself with the shifting 
currents of the art world and has struggled through long, dry periods and bouts 
of self-doubt. Born in Latvia in 1939, where her childhood was spent in the 
shadow of World War II, she emigrated to America (Indiana, to be specific) in 
1949, and moved to Los Angeles in 1962. Eighteen years later, she relocated to 
New York, and she now claims to have no interest whatsoever in the West. She 
occasionally shows new work in Manhattan, but Los Angeles will have to be 
satisfied with this mini-retrospective comprising 10 prints and two drawings 
from 1972 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
There are no surprises in this show, which is basically Celmins' greatest hits. 
Graphite renderings drained of color, her nature studies have a flat coolness 
evocative of Jasper Johns, an artist she acknowledges as an important 
influence. Also reminiscent of Johns is the way Celmins' work warps one's 
perception of time and spatial depth. She once commented: "The one thing I got 
from Los Angeles was a spatial interest that is not like that of a New York 
artist," and she does invest space with a strange, piercing clarity uniquely 
her own. Panoramic yet finely articulated, her pictures read as photographs 
from a distance, and grow softer and looser the closer you get. A master of 
surface on a par with Jackson Pollock, her images are unified fields that seem 
not so much drawn as gently unrolled like a taut skin across the paper. 
</P>
<P>
In an untitled work from 1975, we see a distant galaxy represented by glowing 
pinpoints of light -- a profoundly simple image that simultaneously telegraphs 
terror, ecstasy and curiosity. Celmins describes her work as "a record of 
mindfulness" and it does conjure a vision of a silent watcher gazing at the 
physical world with endless patience and a strange sense of foreboding. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view is "Sixth Sense," a group show introducing six young New York 
artists. Their work tends to be elegant, dandified -- a bit mannered in fact. 
With art this slick, it's a good bet we'll be seeing more of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Pence Gallery, 908 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica, to Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-Edge Rigor: Scot Heywood's painting is many things, but one thing it's not 
is new. Malevich made this painting at the beginning of the century, Mondrian 
updated it a few decades later, Ad Reinhardt did his version in the '50s, and 
Peter Halley and the '80s Neo-Geo crowd did the latest variation on the theme. 
</P>
<P>
Heywood, however, conforms to the rigorous brand of hard-edge geometric 
abstraction that flourished in the '70s. Harking back to an era when art 
couldn't seem to get clean and empty enough to satisfy itself, his detached, 
unemotional inquiries into composition, surface, texture, edge, volume and 
space resonate with ideas associated with Zen. Austere in the extreme, it's a 
style completely at odds with the viewing habits of 20th-Century man, who 
hungers for the spectacular and the new. This is art equivalent of a 
macrobiotic diet -- all the fat has been pared away. 
</P>
<P>
Like all Minimal art, Heywood's paintings rely on the energy the viewer brings 
to them, and in the four stark-white paintings on view here he creates a 
sterile chamber suitable for navel gazing or catnapping, depending on where 
you're at. Oddly shaped modular units fitted together and positioned on the 
wall at a cocked angle, the paintings engage and activate the entire space -- 
possibly because the gallery rooms (designed by artist Larry Bell) abide by 
rules similar to Heywood's. The meticulously buffed hardwood floors and 
pristine white walls stripped of embellishment seem an extension of the 
paintings, which appear to hover in front of the walls rather than cling to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Heywood's work initially seems a bit wan, but this style curiously has come to 
be perceived as rather macho -- a reading possibly explained by the fact that 
the making of this sort of work calls for intense soul searching. With no 
image, color, narrative or distraction of any sort, it's just you, the 
materials and the void. Sissies need not apply. Defiantly out of step with 
current art world trends, this style of painting has the cranky eccentricity of 
people who insist on caning their own chairs or churning their own butter.

JAZZ NOTES: LOCAL CORNETIST BERRY'S A GLOBE-TROTTER TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of us might think of cornetist and bandleader Bill Berry as just a local 
player, one who can often be heard in clubs such as the Biltmore Hotel's Grand 
Avenue Bar -- he's there with his L.A. Big Band on Monday at 5 p.m. -- 
Chadney's or the Indigo Jazz Club. But Berry is a globe-trotter as well. He's 
recently returned from a month in England and Sweden, and after a few dates in 
the Southland this week -- besides the Biltmore, his big band plays a free 
concert in the Times Mirror Central Court of the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art on Sunday, 1:30 p.m. -- he scampers off for a three-week tour of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
In England, where Berry travels about twice a year, he played the Birmingham 
and Grimsby Jazz Festivals and a number of clubs in London, such as the 
well-known Pizza Express. While working there, he ran into some hometown 
musical pals who were also touring the Continent. "(Guitarist) Ron Anthony, 
(trumpeter) Buddy Childers and (bassist) Jim Hughart (all in London with Frank 
Sinatra) came down one night and sat in with me," he said. "I also ran into 
(pianist) Nat Pierce, who happened to be over there, and we played together at 
an afternoon session at London's Guild Hall." Berry plays with Pierce's 
Capp-Pierce Juggernaut Big Band at the free Malibu Arts Festival in Malibu, 
Saturday, 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Berry returns to Great Britain in September, to take part in a film written and 
directed by Alan Plater. "It's what we'd call a Movie of the Week about a 
trumpet player," he said. "I only have a few lines but I guess I'll do quite a 
bit of playing." 
</P>
<P>
The brassman, who is renowned for his early '60s tenure with the Duke Ellington 
Orchestra, is represented on two recent reissues, his own "Hello, Rev" (Concord 
Jazz CD), and a 2-record "Woody Herman Live in 1957" set (Status Records). "We 
recorded that at a dance in Omaha," said Berry, who was with Herman for "two or 
three years" during the '50s. Asked what he recalled of the late leader, Berry 
said, "Woody was one of the greatest, that's all. Everything about him was 
special." 
</P>
<P>
MEMORIAL FOR CARAVAN: Organist Jimmy Caravan, leader of the Blues Caravan who 
died on July 7 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, will be honored at the Jimmy 
Caravan Memorial Benefit, tonight and Saturday at the Indigo Jazz Club in 
Compton. 
</P>
<P>
The blues was Caravan's first love, and members of L.A. blues community -- 
Harmonica Fats, Joe Houston, Guitar Shorty, among them -- plus Eddie Daniels 
from the Platters and Blues Caravan alumni saxman Steve Hooks and guitarist Ray 
Bailey will perform at the benefit. Showtimes are 4:30-8:30 p.m. and 9:30 
p.m.-1 a.m., today, and 9:30 p.m.-1 a.m., Saturday. The $7 (or 2/$10) requested 
donation will go to Carvan's wife and daughter, said Hooks, who is organizing 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured (Jimmy) would want something like this," Hooks said of the benefit. 
"He touched so many people's lives and not that many of them got a chance to 
pay their respects. I didn't want him to go out without doing something." 
Information: (213) 632-1234. 
</P>
<P>
CLUB BEAT: Bassist Luther Hughes is in charge of the jazz comings-and-goings at 
El Matador, (16903 Algonquin St., Huntington Beach, (714) 846-5337). Hughes is 
in with his quartet, featuring guitarist Frank Potenza, tonight and Saturday, 
8:30 p.m. There's no cover for the bassist's band, but the club does charge for 
big bands that appear on Mondays. This week, it's the Joey Sellers Jazz 
Aggregation, and Aug. 6, Roger Neumann's Rather Large Band. . . . The former 
Club 88 has reopened as Radio (11784 Pico Blvd., West Los Angeles (213) 
444-9344) and will go with Latin jazz on Sundays. This week, Iguana is 
spotlighted. 
</P>
<P>
RIM SHOTS: The annual free Watts Towers Jazz Festival takes place Sunday at 
Watts Towers Arts Center (1727 E. 107th St., Watts, (213) 569-8181), 11 a.m.-6 
p.m. This year's lineup includes Cedar Walton, Don Cherry, Papo Conga, Johnny 
Otis, Nedra Wheeler and the B Sharp Quintet. . . . Filmmaker Spike Lee will 
autograph copies of his new book, "Mo' Better Blues," about the making of his 
film of the same name -- which centers around the life of a jazz musician -- at 
the Samuel French Theatre and Film Bookshop (7623 Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood), 
today, from 5-7 p.m. . . . Bandleader/reedman/composer Benny Carter was the 
recent recipient of The American Federation of Jazz Societies' "The Benny," a 
bronze statuette in the likeness of Carter, created by artist/bassist John 
Heard. The award honored Carter for his achievements in a 60-year career; 
forthcoming presentations will honor others who have made great contributions 
to jazz, while keeping the magnitude of Carter's efforts in mind.

A SERENADE OF CLASSICS FROM PIANIST, BASSIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Grace, empathy and an abundance of jazz feeling have long been the hallmarks of 
the felicitous collaboration of pianist Alan Broadbent and bassist Putter 
Smith. Armed with these assets and few more for good measure, the pair 
serenaded a small but mostly attentive audience Tuesday in the lounge of 
Lunaria, a new Westside bistro that spotlights jazz and, occasionally, 
Brazilian music. 
</P>
<P>
Broadbent and Smith delivered classic tunes, from Benny Golson's "Along Came 
Betty" to Clifford Brown's "Daahoud" and Billy Strayhorn's "Upper Manhattan 
Medical Group," offering melody readings and improvisations as imaginative as 
they were musical. 
</P>
<P>
His eyes closed, his head slowly shaking from side to side, Broadbent sat at 
the same Yamaha grand piano that was a fixture at the now-defunct Comeback Inn 
in Venice and played with verve and elan. On "Betty," he ripped off lines that 
could have been made of glowing pearls, so even and round was the shape of each 
note. Later, he shifted to locked-hands chords that were full of light, as if a 
stream of sunshine had entered a darkened room. 
</P>
<P>
On Tadd Dameron's "If You Could See Me Now," the pianist was purposefully 
pensive, his ideas sometimes stated with the apprehension of a cat walking 
through wet grass. Still, quiet explosions occurred within each brief melodic 
statement. The closing "Daahoud" crackled with an understated intensity. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was his own man as well as Broadbent's partner. He hunched over his 
instrument as he played, delivering lines that supported the pianist, yet were 
never an intrusion. His solos were often composed of brief, telling remarks, as 
on "Invitation," where his minimalist efforts left a lot of space while still 
echoing the shape and substance of the song's melody. ZAN STEWART

'BURN THIS' IGNITES SAN DIEGO REPERTORY;

THEATER: FOUR CHARACTERS TELL HARD TRUTHS ABOUT LOVE AND LOSS IN A SEARING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Love isn't easy in Lanford Wilson's "Burn This." 
</P>
<P>
It hurts right from the beginning in this powerful play, now in a searing 
production at the San Diego Repertory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
When the play starts, the hurt comes in the wake of a loved one's death. 
</P>
<P>
Anna and her gay roommate, Larry, are grieving because their third roommate, 
Robbie, whom they loved, died in a boating accident with his gay lover. 
</P>
<P>
Anna is also angry because Robbie's family never knew him, never acknowledged 
he was gay, never went to see his work as a dancer. 
</P>
<P>
And Larry is also jocular, because humor to him is a dueling sword used to keep 
pain at bay. 
</P>
<P>
At least, they think they're hurt and angry and funny. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that neither of them begins to understand the intensity of what 
hurt, anger, humor and even love can be until Robbie's older brother, the 
fiercely heterosexual Pale, walks into their lives with the uprooting force of 
a natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Did Pale love Robbie? Yes -- with the same howling cry with which he expresses 
shame at his brother's homosexuality. Is he hurt and angry at his brother's 
death? He is an open wound, flailing at everything in sight, with his fists and 
his words. Is he funny? Almost constantly, with the humor that comes from 
telling the truth about people. 
</P>
<P>
Does he love Anna, whom he has just met at his brother's funeral? 
</P>
<P>
Enough to try to tear apart both her life and his, just so they can be 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Pale's theme song is Bruce Springsteen's "I'm on Fire." Wilson told the 
director, Sam Woodhouse, that he listened to that music over and over when 
writing about Pale, according to a staffer at the Rep. 
</P>
<P>
Woodhouse plays the song on stage, in addition to an electrifying original 
score by Lawrence Czoka. 
</P>
<P>
It fits. 
</P>
<P>
All the pieces fit in this powerful jigsaw puzzle about four interlocking lives 
-- for there is a fourth character, Anna's rich, nice-guy boyfriend, Burton, 
who vies with Pale for her troubled heart. 
</P>
<P>
Woodhouse has assembled an excellent cast for the San Diego premiere of what 
was a Broadway triumph in 1987 for John Malkovich as Pale (Malkovich is now 
playing the part in London) and Joan Allen, who won a Best Actress Tony as 
Anna. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Van Valkenburgh lacks some of the delicacy we might expect of a 
dancer-choreographer. She seems a little too like Pale in an earthy sort of 
way. But she brings an intelligence and beauty to the part to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Matthews, who was so good as Anton in Nikolai Kolyada's "Slingshot," part 
of the Soviet Arts Festival at the San Diego Rep last year, is terrific as 
Larry. Scene-stealingly funny, he also shows you glimpses of the depths of 
loneliness that are the wellsprings of his humor. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Meek's Pale is a live wire that turns the electricity on. The moment he 
strides on stage, one can feel a jolt of adrenaline. 
</P>
<P>
And Andrew Barnicle takes what might seem to be the thankless role of Burton, 
the poor little rich screenwriter and makes us respect both the understanding 
and the pain of one who observes life better than he lives it. 
</P>
<P>
All four characters are so vividly real that at times they seem to overpopulate 
the Lyceum Stage, even though this genuinely large stage has never seemed 
bigger, thanks to Robert Brill's expansive design of Anna's and Larry's New 
York loft. 
</P>
<P>
The large, level unpainted living space, with minimal personal effects, and 
windows through which you can see snow falling, conveys the bareness of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Lighting by Ashley York Kennedy alternately warms and chills the space, moving 
us through day and night. The lighting also highlights the theme of fire, and 
the different forms it takes: a match lighting Anna's cigarette as the show 
opens. Burton lighting candles to try to conjure up a romantic mood for himself 
and Anna. The fire that fills the darkness when Pale (who is always burning up) 
and Anna embrace. 
</P>
<P>
The costumes by Christine Dougherty fit the characters perfectly: Pale, who is 
as hard on his well-made clothes as he is on himself and everyone around him; 
Larry, who likes a little flash in his attire; Anna, with her Bohemian tastes, 
and Burton, with his quiet sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard not to take these characters home with you. It is hard not to take 
home the revelations they encounter. And for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
"Lies happen every 10 seconds," says Pale. But not here. Wilson, with the 
gallant aid of Woodhouse, his actors and designers, is telling the truth about 
love and life with every breath. The truth, thank goodness, is hard to resist. 
</P>

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: REISSUES SPOTLIGHT VINTAGE R&amp;B 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles' Specialty Records will probably always be best remembered as the 
musical home of Little Richard, but the new "Legends of Specialty" reissue 
series demonstrates that the R&amp;B-oriented company was far more than a 
one-artist operation. 
</P>
<P>
Though Specialty also helped introduce such noteworthy post-World War II 
vocalists as Sam Cooke and Lloyd Price, the first six editions in the new 
series spotlight Jesse Belvin, Jimmy Liggins, Joe Liggins, Percy Mayfield, Roy 
Milton and Larry Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"This series is designed to expose the range and depth of our catalogue," said 
Beverly Rupe, president of Specialty and daughter of label founder Art Rupe. 
The next four albums in the series -- featuring Cooke and Price, among others 
-- will be released early next year. Each CD in the series, supervised by 
singer and pop historian Billy Vera, contains approximately two dozen songs. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven years before Little Richard's "Tutti Frutti" in 1956, Roy Milton 
released a double-sided hit ("R.M. Blues" and "Milton's Boogie") on Rupe's Juke 
Box Records that not only established Milton as a key figure in the evolution 
of R&amp;B, but also gave Rupe the capital to develop his record company, whose 
name he soon changed to Specialty. 
</P>
<P>
Of the other artists featured in the first group of albums, Larry Williams may 
be the best known to today's pop-rock audience because the Beatles recorded 
three of his songs: "Dizzy Miss Lizzy," "Bad Boy" and "Slow Down." 
</P>
<P>
Mayfield, however, is probably the most respected of the artists in this set. A 
singer and songwriter of exceptional talent, Mayfield's first Specialty hit, 
1950's "Please Send Me Someone to Love," remained his most popular record, but 
"Hit the Road, Jack," -- recorded by Ray Charles -- is probably his best-known 
song. 
</P>
<P>
But the Belvin album is in many ways the most intriguing, because his smooth 
vocal style so richly reflected the doo-wop strains of early Los Angeles 
R&amp;B that were defined by such records as the Penguins' "Earth Angel" (a 
song co-written by Belvin) and "Dream Girl" (a Belvin duet with Marvin 
Phillips). The album also includes a dozen previously unreleased tracks or 
demos -- most recorded for one of the labels John Dolphin ran in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
The Liggins brothers both dealt in an urban jump-blues style that, Vera points 
out in his liner notes, was a link between swing and rock. Joe, the elder 
Liggins, had the most hits, including "The Honeydripper" (on Exclusive Records 
in 1945) and "Pink Champagne" (on Specialty in 1950). 
</P>
<P>
IN THE STORES: Albums that are either new in CD or have been shifted from 
main-line to budget packages include volumes 1 and 2 of Joan Baez's "Joan Baez 
in Concert" (Vanguard), Bob Dylan's "Shot of Love" (Columbia), Fairport 
Convention's debut album (Warner Bros.) and Bette Midler's "Songs for the New 
Depression" and "Thighs and Whispers" (Atlantic).

DON'T MAKE ROOM FOR 'ROMANCE'

The summer series "Room for Romance" is "Love, American Style" 1990, the kind 
of non-stick, inconsequential TV anthology that you can flick away like lint. 
</P>
<P>
It premieres at 10 tonight on CBS (Channel 2 and 8), the locale being a New 
York apartment house as hermetically sealed and climatically controlled as a 
shopping mall, the characters being residents who look like they were squeezed 
from a tube of toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
The sights, sounds and smells of New York are shut out here, as are real 
emotions and intense feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's three stories all involve romance, a sort of quick-dissolving, 
sexless sex that is set to lilting elevator music. The show's only recurring 
characters are a sardonically philosophizing concierge (Dom Irrera) and a 
precocious 10-year-old resident (Rebecca Harrell). Their too-infrequent, 
lobby's-eye observations about the lives of the other tenants provide the only 
relief from the hour's tedium. HOWARD ROSENBERG

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
* Amici, 3220 Park Center Drive, Coast Mesa. (714) 850-9399. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays from 
5:30 to 10:30 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays from 5:30 to 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Massimo Navaretta is alive and well at Amici, making even more of an impression 
than he did at Scampi, his previous success. This is a serious new restaurant 
that is small and intimate, all Deco lines and salmon-colored sconces, and what 
comes out of the kitchen is equally stylish. Special antipasti like potato 
souffle with porcini and lightly fried zucchini blossoms are pure magic; 
wonderful scampi are flown in from Europe and are fabulous eaten from the 
shell. Great pastas, excellent imported wines. 
</P>
<P>
* The Food Court at Yaohan Market, 665 Paularino St., Costa Mesa. (714) 
557-6699. Most concessions open daily from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are looking for a crash course in contempo Japanese, look no further 
than Yaohan Market in Costa Mesa and its colorful Food Court. Several 
concessions are in full swing here, serving a variety of Japanese lunch and 
snack foods including bento (Japanese lunch box), ramen and curry rice; there's 
even a bona fide sushi bar. You will also find a bakery that serves Japanized 
versions of such Western dishes as clam chowder and spaghetti -- and a large 
number of curious, puzzled customers. Good, cheap fun. 
</P>
<P>
* The Original Pancake House, 1418 E. Lincoln Avenue, Anaheim. (714) 693-1390. 
Open Tuesdays through Sundays from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Original Pancake House is one of the very best restaurants in Orange 
County. Just ask anyone who has eaten there. All the batters are made with 
sourdough yeast and come straight from the grill -- light, finely textured and 
complex. The Belgian waffles are eggy and crispy, and the apple pancake, a 
giant golden puff with a cinnamon glaze topping, is one step away from nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
* Prego, 18420 Von Karman Avenue, Irvine. (714) 553-1333. Open Mondays from 
11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., Tuesdays through Thursdays till 11 p.m., Fridays till 
midnight; Saturdays from 5 p.m. to midnight, Sundays from 5 to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Prego, 4 years old, remains one of the area's most impressive Italian 
restaurants. The exterior is that of a Tuscan villa; inside, it's elegant and 
neo-classical. The kitchen serves mostly northern Italian fare that is all the 
rage now: homemade pastas, rotisserie meats, sumptuous desserts. It's best to 
stick to basics here -- wood-fired pizzas, terrific roast duck and lamb. 
Service ranges from gracious to arrogant, but there are plenty of excellent 
Italian wines to toss around. 
</P>
<P>
* The Cat and Custard Cup, 800 E. Whittier Blvd., La Habra. (213) 694-3812 or 
(714) 996-6496. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; 
Mondays from 5:30 to 9 p.m., Tuesdays through Fridays until 10 p.m., Saturdays 
until 10:30 p.m., and Sundays from 5 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe El Cholo, 840 E. Whittier Blvd., La Habra. (213) 694-4600 or (714) 
525-1320. Open Mondays through Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sundays 
from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Cat and Custard Cup and Cafe El Cholo are located across a La Habra parking 
lot from one another and their themes couldn't be more divergent. One is a 
lovingly reconstructed English pub with a campy Continental menu and dark, 
medieval trappings. The other is bright, festive and Mexican, with fajitas, 
guacamole and frosty margaritas. Both are charming, cheerful, and worth a wide 
detour. 
</P>
<P>
* 3-6-9 Shanghai, 613 N. Euclid St., Anaheim. (714) 635-8319. Open daily except 
Sundays from 11:30 a.m., Mondays through Thursdays till 9:30 p.m., Fridays and 
Saturdays till 10. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best small Chinese restaurants in the heavily ethnic San Gabriel 
Valley, 3-6-9 Shanghai has opened this storefront sister in an Anaheim shopping 
mall, bringing nearly all of its popular dishes. Handmade breads and savory 
dumpling preparations excel here along with such exotic cold appetizers as tea 
smoked chicken and braised baby bamboo. The restaurant is cheap and basic; tell 
them to tread lightly on the MSG. The steamed pork with rice powder is a 
revelation. 
</P>
<P>
* The Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton, 33533 Ritz-Carlton Drive, Dana Point. 
(714) 240-5008. Open nightly for dinner from 6 to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A meal at the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton is always a memorable experience, 
but in some instances the memories tend to be a bit flawed. Amidst the 
beautiful surroundings, elegant service and well-heeled clientele, chef Fabrice 
Canelle has introduced a creative, eccentric but imperfect cuisine, a blend of 
French, Californian and international influences. The menu is small, and dishes 
have a tendency toward the sweet. Salads, Sonoma duck liver, lamb and 
outstanding desserts are the hallmarks. 
</P>
<P>
* Voila Bistro and Grill, 16871 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 841-1166. 
Open Tuesdays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., Tuesdays through 
Saturdays from 5 to 10 p.m., Sundays from 4:30 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A new local dining spot, Voila Bistro and Grill is a surprising find indeed, a 
combination of Paris casual and Huntington Beach chic. Chef Rochelle Robinson 
turns a brilliant onion soup -- a bistro classic -- and does fine braised duck 
and lamb dishes. Dessert souffles such as chocolate and lemon are on the varied 
menu, and given proper notice the chef will even make a cheese souffle. Salads, 
pizzas and a respectable little wine list fill things out nicely. 
</P>
<P>
* Heritage Brewing Company, 24921 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana Point. (714) 
240-2060. Open Sundays through Thursdays from 11:30 a.m. to midnight, Fridays 
and Saturdays till 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Heritage Brewing Company has the somewhat dubious distinction of being Orange 
County's only brewpub, a rowdy place with dart boards, foosball and a young, 
party crazed crowd. If the beer had any flavor at all one could even call the 
place lively. Four brews are offered -- pale ale, golden ale, Irish red and 
Dana porter -- along with a variety of salads, finger foods and sandwiches, the 
best of which is beef on wick, wafer-thin roast beef on a salted bun. The 
burgers aren't bad. 
</P>
<P>
* Kotobuki, 24356 Avenida de la Carlota, Laguna Hills. (714) 587-0290. Open 
Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays 
from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Totally awesome. That's how Hiro Watanabe, sushi-maker extraordinaire, 
describes most of his creations at Kotobuki, his pint-size, big-hearted new 
Japanese restaurant. Hiro-san's food has a quirky appeal -- from Philadelphia 
roll (crab, avocado and cream cheese) to the more authentic preparations such 
as uni (sea urchin) and hamachi (yellowtail). Put yourself in the chef's hands 
and let him do his thing. He probably will anyway. 
</P>
<P>
* Panda Inn, 2 Center Point Drive, La Palma. (714) 522-6082. Open daily from 11 
a.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Panda Inn, an upscale Chinese restaurant chain, recently arrived in La Palma. 
It can credit its success to its attractive, mildly Americanized 
interpretations of traditional Mandarin cuisine. Purists beware. Shy away from 
the complicated fare (lemon this, orange that) and stick to basics: the 
well-crafted soups, the excellent lamb and pork dishes, and the first-rate 
sauteed vegetables. Don't go home without a serving of mango pudding for 
dessert. It is a real palate cleanser, with a refreshing taste. 
</P>
<P>
* Ciao, 1730 E. 17th St., Santa Ana. (714) 972-3101. Open Mondays through 
Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Saturdays from 4:30 to 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
Ciao is one of those indistinct little neighborhood restaurants you can drive 
by 100 times without noticing, but it happens to be an exceptional one. Bina 
Crivello, a Sicilian mater familias who runs the restaurant with the help of 
her five sons, makes most of the food herself: crusty pizzas, earthy pastas, 
and a good rich tomato sauce to go with them. Bring a hefty appetite, and leave 
room for the excellent tiramisu -- intense, mocha rich, and drooling mascarpone 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
* Morell's, in the Irvine Hilton, 17900 Jamboree Road, Irvine. (714) 863-3111. 
Open daily except except Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., 6 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Morell's is one hotel restaurant making an obvious effort to keep up with the 
times, but one still comes away with the impression that instituitional 
practices die hard. It's a quietly elegant room done up in various shades of 
pink, and there is a formal quality to the service. Appetizers such as 
sweetbreads and smoked salmon are among the strong suits. Desserts are visual 
stunners. The basically sound main dishes suffer occasionally from a desire to 
impress.

NURSING HOMES: A WOMAN'S CARE FOR HER MOTHER PROMPTED HER TO ORGANIZE A GROUP 
OF TRAVELING MUSICIANS TO BRIGHTEN THE LIVES OF THE ELDERLY.

<P>
About 40 elderly people -- mostly women -- sat unmoving in wheelchairs in the 
activity room of the Tarzana Health Care Center nursing home one Sunday 
afternoon. Faded red, white and blue streamers left over from the Fourth of 
July hung on the walls, along with some calculatedly neutral decorator 
landscapes. There was little talking. Some of the residents slumped forward, 
half-asleep. Others sipped medication. 
</P>
<P>
A statuesque, effervescent woman strode into the room in a lovely floral dress. 
A pianist began to play, and the woman, Sonia Flaum, broke grandly into song. 
Many songs. "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling," "Let Me Call You Sweetheart," 
"Around the World," "Ain't She Sweet," "You Are My Sunshine," "My Melody of 
Love," "Those Were the Days," "Bye, Bye Blackbird." 
</P>
<P>
Old hands clapped. Old eyes opened and brightened a little. Old feet shuffled 
in time. Old voices wobbled to life and sang along with Flaum's vivacious 
soprano. 
</P>
<P>
 Pack up all your cares and woes 
</P>
<P>
 Here I go, singin' low 
</P>
<P>
 Byyyyeeee, Byyyyeeee . . . Blackbird. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 And no one in the room at that moment was happier than Rena LeBlanc, organizer 
of this traveling cabaret show, which for the past three years has visited 
nursing homes throughout the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I started this because my mother was in nursing homes for many years," said 
LeBlanc, a Woodland Hills free-lance writer. "It was a nightmare experience for 
me. I saw a lot of neglect. At one point, she was near death, and she was not 
responding. . . . I would visit her maybe two or three times a week, but I felt 
more was needed, so I advertised for a musician to come and perform for her. I 
got a young woman who played the flute. . . . My mother began to respond more, 
and she got better. 
</P>
<P>
"I began to bring cassettes and play Yiddish music for my mother and others who 
liked that kind of music. . . . I could see from these two things how much joy 
this music brought to these people. . . . Music is medicine for the soul." 
</P>
<P>
British-born Flaum, a lifelong professional performer who, with pianist Wayne 
Behlendorf has formed the mainstay of LeBlanc's cabaret, agreed. "The thrill is 
when they come in, and they're all down and medicated or whatever, and you sing 
for them -- and it just wakes them up!" she said during a break in her 
performance. "And then you feel good, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
"After I finish, no matter how tired I've been, when I see the look on their 
faces, I don't feel tired any more," Behlendorf said. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc's mother passed away in 1979. And LeBlanc's vague plans for bringing 
music to nursing homes finally coalesced three years ago, as an outgrowth of 
her "Opera Encores" -- private parties she organizes for single opera lovers. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the professional musicians -- such as Flaum and Behlendorf -- at the 
parties gladly volunteered to help with the nursing home cabaret, and there 
have been monthly shows since. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to use every power I have to try to change things in the homes, because 
I saw such horrible things, and horrible things happened to my mother," LeBlanc 
said. "There are wonderful people working in nursing homes, but there is so 
much wrong that has to be made better, and that's why I'm doing the cabaret and 
the other things." 
</P>
<P>
The "other things," at the moment, are an ABC movie of the week, produced by 
David Wolper and starring Fred Savage, "The Legacy of Michael Patrick Smith," 
to air this fall. It is based on LeBlanc's series of Reader's Digest articles 
about a Colorado muscular dystrophy victim who sued the federal government on 
behalf of all nursing home patients. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc plans to start a newsletter later this year aimed at nursing home 
patients and their families, encouraging them to seek the best possible care. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there's the cabaret, which is becoming something of an 
institution at Valley nursing homes -- sometimes not totally appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the staff has forgotten we're coming, and we have to actually help 
them move people into the activity rooms," said LeBlanc. "It's kind of 
disappointing that in some nursing homes, they still don't see to it that the 
people are ready. Some are delighted to have us come." 
</P>
<P>
Tarzana Health Care's staff is among those that are delighted. 
</P>
<P>
"In this day and age," said Michael Menkin, who for 20 years has been 
recreation director at Tarzana Health Care, "when everybody has their hands 
out, any group or people that just come because they want to really bring 
happiness and entertainment to nursing homes is very special. I mean, a lot of 
people will come and say, 'I do an hour, and it's $40.' But Mrs. LeBlanc and 
the others do this all voluntarily." 
</P>
<P>
And the patients react with obvious pleasure. One Tarzana Health Care resident 
-- Gwendolyn Van Enger -- raised her hands high over her head and swayed from 
side to side in her wheelchair as Flaum sang "Those Were the Days." 
</P>
<P>
Another, Edna Hanson, who in pearls, full makeup, and fur wrap looked ready for 
an evening at the music center, drew herself up in her chair, smiling. "Of 
course, I can't dance," she said, "because I have this broken and that broken, 
but I was very good before!" 
</P>
<P>
At one cabaret performance, a woman actually rose from her wheelchair and began 
waltzing to the Flaum/Behlendorf accompaniment. At another, Flaum was singing 
"I Hope You Live to Be a Hundred" when a creaky voice retorted, "I am 100! I'm 
a hundred-and-one!" (The tune has since been dropped from the repertoire.) 
</P>
<P>
Some audience members sing along in their own words, or their own key -- and 
others know every word and note of every song. "Last time we sang here," said 
Flaum, "there was a woman who used to be an opera singer, and everything I 
sang, she sang with me! It was so hilarious. It was wonderful. And you could 
still hear the beauty in her voice." 
</P>
<P>
This is no easy gig. Flaum admitted to "having to take a short walk" after the 
time a man came to visit his wife, a nursing home resident, to celebrate their 
"50th or 60th" wedding anniversary. Flaum sang them a love song from their 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it gets a little overpowering," said pianist Behlendorf. "You have 
to be a little tough, and some entertainers can't take it. But we need more 
people to do this. . . . You know, people are always crying about how they have 
no place to sing or entertain. This is a great way to break into show 
business." (He might be right. Broadway singer Michael Feinstein, the noted 
Gershwin specialist, got his start in nursing homes.) 
</P>
<P>
At the Sunday afternoon cabaret in the Tarzana Health Care Center, former 
operatic soprano Paula Roy of Canoga Park, a new cabaret volunteer, sang 
"Torna, Sorrento." One woman reached out her hands, and Roy took them in her 
own, as the patient smiled wistfully and rocked to and fro. Then Flaum took the 
stage again. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what?" she said. "I'm going to take you for my little trip around the 
world! Because we can't really go right now! How about that? Is that OK?" 
</P>
<P>
And again, old hands clapped. Old eyes opened and brightened a little. Old feet 
shuffled in time. Old voices wobbled to life and sang along with Flaum's 
vivacious soprano: 
</P>
<P>
It might have been in County town, 
</P>
<P>
or in New York or gay Paree, or even London town 
</P>
<P>
No more will I go all around the world 
</P>
<P>
Till I have found my world in you . . .

BUDGET CUTS, TAX HIKES AGREED ON; 
</P>

CALIFORNIA: BUT FUNDING FOR L.A. COUNTY PRISONS AND AUTOMATIC SPENDING

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders, operating behind a wall of 
secrecy, tried Thursday to patch together a $50-billion-plus budget proposal 
based on sharply reduced payments to public employee pension systems, carefully 
targeted tax increases and a long list of cuts to health and welfare programs, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
But while general agreement was reported early in the day on roughly $3.6 
billion in spending reductions and tax increases, the governor and Democratic 
leaders were clearly at odds over at least two thorny issues: funding 
reauthorization for two proposed prisons in Los Angeles County and legislation 
requiring automatic spending reductions during off years when revenues don't 
match legal demands on spending. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders said members of their party were balking at both demands 
being made by Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
As to the tentative budget solution as a whole, the balance between revenue and 
expenses is achieved partially through a series of apparently tenuous devices 
including shifting funds around, delaying payments and reducing state 
contributions to pension funds on the promise they will be restored later. 
</P>
<P>
After a meeting of Assembly Democrats where the package was outlined, Speaker 
Willie Brown described the reaction as not good, although he said he had not 
yet begun trying to round up votes for passage. 
</P>
<P>
Brown met with Deukmejian and other legislative leaders twice Thursday. Draping 
a veil of secrecy around the talks, the lawmakers left the governor's office by 
back doors so they could avoid reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted later, Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said 
that despite their hasty departures from the governor's office he thought the 
negotiators were "close to a proposal." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno said there are "hang-ups on a lot 
of it but we're hopeful." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles prisons issue could be the hardest to resolve because it 
involves the opposition of legislators from both parties who represent the 
areas chosen as sites. One is near downtown Los Angeles and the other is in the 
Antelope Valley. Some lawmakers say they are willing to vote against the entire 
budget package if money for the prisons is in it. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), who said 
she will continue to fight to keep the prison money out of the budget and that 
Brown has been "very, very supportive" of her position. Asked if this was the 
case, Brown told a reporter: "Absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
The list of proposed cuts and tax increases began circulating in the Capitol 
while Deukmejian and four legislative leaders met again privately in the hopes 
of resolving an impasse that has left the state without a budget for 27 days. 
</P>
<P>
The list contained many of the proposed spending reductions and tax and fee 
increases included in the $55-billion-plus spending plan approved by the Senate 
on July 10. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some notable differences. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a gap of roughly $700 million to $800 million and the continued 
effort by Democrats to protect Proposition 98 funding guarantees to public 
schools, Deukmejian and the legislative negotiators reportedly decided to 
temporarily reduce payments to the State Teachers' Retirement System by $500 
million. In addition, they would "save" tens of millions through an accounting 
change that would place state contributions to the Public Employees' Retirement 
System on a quarterly, rather than monthly, payment schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the budget actions would not reduce benefits or pensions for 
retirees. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for reducing payments into the fund now to achieve immediate budget 
savings, 10 years from now the state would begin making increased contributions 
to more than make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, in the long run, we think retired teachers will benefit. Given 
that, and the fact that it may solve the budget crisis and protect Proposition 
98, we think it is a fair proposal," said Patrick C. McCallum, a lobbyist for 
the Faculty Assn. of California Community Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also reportedly is insisting on imposing a first-ever sales tax on 
newspapers and periodicals, which would raise $40 million annually. The 
proposal would remove a historic exemption to the sales tax given newspapers 
and magazines, one of dozens of special exemptions granted over the years by 
the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the Senate-approved spending plan would have removed sales tax 
exemptions on candy, motion pictures and advertising, in addition to 
newspapers. The entire package ran into trouble in the Assembly and was 
scrapped by Democrats in the lower house. Deukmejian, latching onto a proposal 
first made by Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, reportedly has 
insisted on keeping the tax proposal for newspapers and magazines. Because the 
sales tax levy varies from county to county, the new tax on newspapers, 
magazines and periodicals would range from 6% to 7 1/2%. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said the tax proposal is Deukmejian's way of getting even with 
newspapers for all the criticism he has received from editorial writers on the 
budget problem, including complaints that he has not supported tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
"It is political retribution for editorially expressing a point of view," said 
Michael B. Dorais, a lobbyist for the California Newspaper Publishers Assn., 
who noted that there are numerous sales tax exemptions for various products. 
"Some of the largest newspapers in the state, including the Los Angeles Times, 
have suggested that new taxes be considered as part of the budget solution. It 
is clear that the governor does not want to let that pass unnoticed." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian spokesman Robert J. Gore denied that there was any special effort to 
penalize newspapers. "The search for revenue is mathematical. There is no other 
motivation," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
The formula to automatically trigger cuts when revenues fall below a certain 
level is another tough issue. Deukmejian has been talking about it for months, 
but the proposal has gotten nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the governor's idea is to put into place in California a mechanism 
similar to the federal government's Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law that 
automatically triggers spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the governor proposed automatic cuts only for pension funds, 
counties, and health and welfare services. Discussions now would expand the 
proposal to include the University of California, the California State 
University system and the Department of Corrections.

MATTA CONVICTED ON 3 OF 4 COUNTS IN CAMARENA CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal court jury in Los Angeles on Thursday convicted a Honduran 
businessman who is reputed to be one of the world's biggest drug kingpins of 
conspiracy in the 1985 abduction and slaying of U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration Agent Enrique Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
The jury, however, acquitted Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros of murdering 
Camarena, who was kidnaped by members of a drug cartel and some of their 
corrupt Mexican law enforcement allies off a Guadalajara street and tortured to 
death in retaliation for raids against the cartel's huge marijuana plantations. 
</P>
<P>
In a case closely watched by the U.S. government and Mexico, the jury convicted 
Matta of three of four counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
Matta's conviction carries a possible life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was announced on the ninth day of deliberations. Afterward, U.S. 
District Judge Edward Rafeedie excused the jury for the day and told them to 
resume deliberations today on three other defendants -- Ruben Zuno Arce, Juan 
Jose Bernabe Ramirez and Javier Vasquez Velasco. 
</P>
<P>
Matta, 45, was convicted of conspiring to kidnap, torture and murder Camarena 
in support of a racketeering enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
He also was convicted of conspiring to kidnap a DEA agent who was performing 
his official duties, and convicted of aiding and abetting the kidnaping of a 
federal agent. 
</P>
<P>
During the eight-week trial, several key pieces of evidence were introduced 
against Matta. Two U.S. government-paid witnesses, both former Guadalajara 
policemen with ties to drug traffickers, testified that they had seen Matta at 
meetings where the kidnaping of Camarena was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
One of the witnesses, Hector Cervantes Santos, said he saw Matta at an October, 
1984, meeting where the kidnaping was discussed at the home of drug trafficker 
Javier Barba Hernandez. Cervantes said that as the drug lords were discussing 
the kidnaping of a DEA agent, Matta said, "Silence is golden." 
</P>
<P>
The other witness, Enrique Plascencia Aguilar, said he saw Matta at another 
meeting two months later at the home of Mexican drug lord Ernesto Fonseca 
Carrillo, where Camarena's photo was passed around. 
</P>
<P>
According to Plascencia, Fonseca said at the meeting that Camarena had to be 
killed. Plascencia also testified that files from a Mexican police agency were 
examined by Matta. Fonseca was convicted in Mexico last year of involvement in 
Camarena's murder and sentenced to a long prison term. He also has been 
indicted in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Other testimony against Matta was offered by Michael Malone, an FBI forensics 
expert. He said hairs removed from Matta's head while he was in a U.S. prison 
in Illinois on other charges matched two hairs found in the Guadalajara house 
where Camarena was tortured. 
</P>
<P>
Malone conceded that hair identification is never definitive in the way that a 
fingerprint identification can be, but the evidence appears to have made an 
impact. Matta's attorneys had the hair examined by another expert, but his 
findings were not presented. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence also was presented that a photo of Matta and a photo of Camarena were 
found in a house owned by Mexico drug lord Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo shortly 
after Camarena was kidnaped. The jurors also were told that Matta was involved 
in a drug enterprise with Felix. Felix has been indicted in Los Angeles of 
being involved in the conspiracy to kill Camarena. He is in a Mexican prison 
after conviction on unrelated drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
DEA officials have said they could have captured Matta at the time, but assert 
that he was aided in fleeing from Guadalajara by corrupt officials of Mexico's 
Federal Security Directorate and Federal Judicial Police. Throughout the trial, 
a number of prosecution witnesses testified about close ties between drug 
barons and Mexican law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
John Zienter, who heads the DEA's office in Los Angeles, declined comment after 
Thursday's verdicts, as did the prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attys. Manuel 
Medrano and John Carlton. James P. Walsh Jr., head of the major narcotics unit 
of the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, said, "I'm delighted." 
</P>
<P>
Matta, wearing a light gray suit, appeared stunned when the verdicts were read 
but said nothing audible. Afterward, his attorney, Martin R. Stolar of New 
York, told Rafeedie that he would file a motion asking that the verdicts be 
overturned because they were inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clearly a major miscarriage of justice," Stolar said outside court. "Mr. 
Matta is disbelieving of the conviction. He had no involvement whatsoever. . . 
. He questions the ability of U.S. courts to fairly and adequately protect a 
Honduran citizen accused in this country." 
</P>
<P>
This is the second major federal conviction against Matta in Los Angeles 
federal court within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, a jury convicted him of running a major cocaine syndicate that 
generated $73 million in proceeds in just nine months in 1981. At the time, 
U.S. Atty. Gary A. Feess said that Matta "is on the level of the top 10 
Colombian drug traffickers." In January, Matta was sentenced to life in prison 
without possibility of parole as the leader of a continuing criminal 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Matta also faces major drug charges in another Los Angeles case and one in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
DEA officials have said in the past that they considered Matta one of the 
world's most important cocaine dealers. They said he came up with the idea to 
transport cocaine overland through Mexico to California after major 
interdiction efforts in Florida had stemmed some of the narcotics flow from 
Colombia there in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Matta was considered a suspect in the Camarena case since shortly after the DEA 
agent was abducted from a Guadalajara street Feb. 7, 1985, taken to the home of 
Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, tortured and murdered. Camarena's 
mutilated body was found about a month later at a ranch outside Guadalajara, 
along with that of his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar. Camarena's slaying 
resulted in the biggest manhunt in DEA history. 
</P>
<P>
To date, 22 people have been indicted and four convicted in the case, with the 
first three convictions coming in a separate 1988 trial. 
</P>
<P>
Matta was arrested by Honduran and U.S. officials in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, in 
April, 1988. Honduras has no extradition treaty, and widespread anti-U.S. riots 
ensued and the annex to the U.S. Embassy there was burned. 
</P>
<P>
Matta apparently had generated considerable good will in Honduras by employing 
as many as 5,000 people at his cattle, cigar and milk production facilities. 
Government sources estimated at one time that he was worth about $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the trial, Matta sat between an attorney and an interpreter and gave 
animated gestures to lawyers and family members in the courtroom. From the 
outset his lawyers did not attempt to hide Matta's involvement in the narcotics 
business, and at times almost seemed to flaunt it. During his opening 
statement, attorney Michael J. Burns acknowledged that Matta faces drug 
trafficking charges in Los Angeles. "But that's in another court . . . that's 
for another day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing argument, Stolar, Matta's lead attorney, reminded the jurors 
once again of his client's drug business. He recalled that one government 
witness said that during 1984 he had transported $150 million in cash from 
cocaine sales from the United States to Mexico for delivery to a drug 
organization run by Felix and Matta. Stolar said that because Matta's drug 
operation had such huge, steady profits, he had no motive for wanting to kill 
Camarena and bring the wrath of the DEA upon him.

PENTAGON URGED TO BAN NORTHROP AS A CONTRACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Justice Department has recommended that the Pentagon bar Northrop Corp. 
from future defense contracts as a result of the firm's guilty plea to criminal 
fraud for faking tests on a nuclear cruise missile program. Moreover, the 
weapon now appears to have more serious problems than previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department attorneys argued to the Air Force that the gravity of 
Northrop's felonies in the case "should give rise" to a prohibition on new 
Pentagon business for the entire corporation. Such a penalty would mark the 
first time that a major defense contractor has been locked out of the Pentagon. 
In the past, divisions or subsidiaries of major defense contractors have been 
temporarily suspended, but a ban on new business -- known as a debarment -- can 
be permanent. 
</P>
<P>
However, Air Force officials have argued for a relatively weak settlement that 
would allow the Los Angeles firm to resume normal business and bear only a 
minor share of the costs of the government's investigation. A final decision on 
debarment is now being considered by an Air Force panel. In the meantime, the 
Northrop division involved in the cruise missile fraud has been under 
indefinite suspension for a year. 
</P>
<P>
The position of Air Force officials toward Northrop appears to fit a pattern in 
which the Pentagon has attempted to protect Northrop from criminal liability, 
according to documents and testimony by several witnesses that will be 
introduced at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
After allegations surfaced in 1987 that Northrop's Western Services Department 
in Pomona, Calif., had been systematically falsifying tests on a guidance 
system for the Air Force's air-launched cruise missile and for a stabilization 
system for the Marine Corps Harrier jet, the services moved to waive certain 
requirements that were not being met, according to Justice Department 
officials. Those actions undercut the Justice Department's efforts to prosecute 
Northrop, according to the officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although Northrop pleaded guilty in February to 34 felony counts of improper 
testing and paid a $17-million criminal fine, the Justice Department dismissed 
a part of its indictment that charged two Northrop executives with felonies. 
Now, Assistant U.S. Atty. William Fahey, who is chief of the public corruption 
and government fraud section of the Justice Department's Los Angeles office, is 
arguing strongly for a debarment of Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not aware of a more significant prosecution (than against Northrop)," 
Fahey said in an internal Justice Department memo sent in March. "This is the 
first time we are aware that a major defense contractor has been convicted of 
failing to conduct critical tests on a nuclear weapon system. If any case cries 
out for debarment, this is the case. If ever the American people deserve to be 
protected from the type of reckless and potentially life-threatening conduct, 
this is it." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of debarment is being considered by the Air Force Suspension and 
Debarment Board, a high-level panel in the Pentagon. The board was about to 
sign a settlement with Northrop in March when Fahey intervened and objected to 
the lax terms proposed by Air Force attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio noted that Fahey himself had moved in court 
earlier this year to dismiss the charges against the two Northrop executives, 
Joseph Yamron and Leopold Engler, citing "the interest of justice and based 
upon the government's assessment of the case." 
</P>
<P>
Cantafio added: "They dismissed the charges inside the courtroom and now they 
are trying to have a trial outside the courtroom -- in whose interests I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
The charges dismissed against the two executives involved allegations that 
Northrop knowingly used a type of damping fluid in a gyroscope for the cruise 
missile's flight data transmitter that would freeze at temperatures under which 
it was required by contract to operate. 
</P>
<P>
The contract called for the gyroscope to operate at minus 65 degrees 
Fahrenheit, but the damping fluid used by Northrop freezes at that temperature. 
An internal Northrop report dating to the early 1980s and delivered to Yamron 
clearly states that the fluid did not meet contractual requirements. 
</P>
<P>
After the Justice Department began its investigation into the issue, however, 
the Air Force stepped in. It agreed to modify a test of the gyroscope's ability 
to meet the cold temperature requirement so that the test conformed to 
Northrop's "theory" of how it should be conducted. That "theory" limited the 
duration of the gyroscope's exposure to minus 65 degrees, permitting the device 
to avoid freezing. 
</P>
<P>
That key concession "was a severe blow" the the Justice Department 
investigation, according to Mark M. Richard, deputy assistant attorney general 
for the criminal division. 
</P>
<P>
Since that decision, Northrop and the Air Force have argued that the flight 
data transmitter is working and that it has caused no operational problems for 
the cruise missile. But congressional investigators say that the Air Force has 
avoided failures by carefully not subjecting the missile to the low 
temperatures normally experienced in operations. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, an internal Justice Department memo earlier this year accused the Air 
Force of knowingly withholding documents that showed that the Northrop 
deficiencies had severely affected the cruise missile's performance. 
</P>
<P>
According to one letter from the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, the Air 
Force knew that the cruise missiles were failing when subjected to temperatures 
that commonly occur at altitudes above 30,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials denied that the missile has performance problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The air-launched cruise missile is a reliable and fully mission-capable weapon 
system in which we have complete confidence," an Air Force spokesman said 
Thursday. "It has been subjected to rigorous and redundant testing. The Air 
Force has conducted 74 air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) test missions and our 
data has never indicated a problem with the flight data transmitter freezing. 
The average test mission subjects the missile to a five-hour subzero . . . 
temperature test prior to launch. As far as we can determine, the alleged 
testing improprieties have not had an impact on the operational capability of 
the ALCM or any of its subcomponents." 
</P>
<P>
But the Air Force statement leaves unclear whether the cruise missiles 
currently meet the minus-65-degree requirement. The statement notes that the 
missile is subjected to subzero temperatures for five hours, but not whether 
those are below minus 65 Fahrenheit. In addition, the statement indicates that 
the missile has never failed a "test mission," but it does not address aborted 
test missions or test flights themselves. 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force spokesman said late Thursday that the service could not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators for Claremont, Calif., attorney Herbert Hafif, who represents 
former Northrop employees who brought the original cruise missile allegations 
under a False Claims Act suit, said that the Air Force's own field reports of 
such test missions often note that tests were aborted for "inclement weather." 
</P>
<P>
"What it amounts to is that they get tested at warmer temperatures," Hafif 
said. "So, then they can say the cold temperature will not affect performance. 
They never freeze them down to where the damping fluid really had a chance to 
freeze." 
</P>
<P>
The cruise missiles are deployed on the wings of B-52 bombers, which loiter for 
hours in flight in the Arctic at altitudes above 35,000 feet. Temperatures can 
easily drop below minus 65 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation into the entire problem was prepared by Boeing, the cruise 
missile's prime contractor. The Boeing investigation report, a copy of which 
was obtained by The Times, said Boeing's concern was raised by a large number 
of failures of the Northrop device at Air Force depots. But Boeing concluded 
that the Air Force depots' test was not proper. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Boeing investigation found, "The demonstrated reliability of the 
FDT (flight data transmitter) has been found to not degrade the missile 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
But the Boeing study cites a failure of three flight data transmitters in 125 
tests conducted up to Feb. 16, 1988, in which the missile was mounted on a wing 
and flown but not launched. That represents a failure rate of 2.4% for a single 
part of the missile, which investigators consider unacceptable because there 
are hundreds of such parts that can fail. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear why Boeing reported three flight data transmitters failures, but 
the Air Force reported none. 
</P>
<P>
Hafif severely faults the Justice Department for dropping the issue, saying 
that the Air Force's actions in reducing the test requirements did not absolve 
Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop's Cantafio said: "Those actions (falsifying tests) took place in a 
30-person satellite operation in Pomona. This company acted in a responsible 
way by closing the plant, firing the plant manager and three other employees. 
We did what any responsible company would do when the matter came to our 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing today was called by Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the 
House Energy and Commerce Committee. Pentagon and Justice Department officials, 
as well as a former Northrop controller, are expected to testify.

HOUSE VOTES TO REPRIMAND FRANK FOR ETHICS VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After three hours of uncommonly rancorous debate, the House voted 
overwhelmingly Thursday to formally reprimand Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), one 
of two openly gay congressmen, for ethics violations stemming from his 
relationship with a male prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
The 408-18 vote came after the House easily turned aside attempts by some 
Republicans to impose the harsher penalties of censure or expulsion on Frank. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional speech on the House floor, Frank apologized to his colleagues. 
"These mistakes were mine. . . . All mine," he said. "I should have known 
better. Now I do. But it's a little too late." 
</P>
<P>
Frank, 50, attributed his ethical problems to a 34-year effort to keep secret 
his homosexuality, an effort that Frank abandoned three years ago with a public 
announcement that he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago I decided that concealment did not work," Frank told members 
who packed the House chamber. "I wish I had decided it earlier." 
</P>
<P>
After the votes, Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House 
Ethics Committee, told reporters: "I'm very pleased the (House) stayed with the 
committee." 
</P>
<P>
The debate over Frank often turned into a heated exchange over moral and 
cultural values. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going on in America is a cultural war," said Rep. William E. Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton), who is one of the most severe congressional critics of 
homosexuality and homosexual activism. "Do we tolerate, do we condone a member 
of this body who knowingly permits a house of prostitution to be operated out 
of his residence?" 
</P>
<P>
Dixon, however, said of Frank: "I think he indicated he made a serious mistake 
but he wanted to let people know why he had done so, and that is because he is 
a gay person." 
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Committee recommended a reprimand for Frank last Friday in a 57-page 
report that capped a 10-month investigation of Frank's relationship with 
admitted prostitute Stephen L. Gobie, whom Frank had placed on his personal 
staff at his own expense. 
</P>
<P>
A reprimand is the least serious of three punishments that the full House can 
administer, followed by censure and expulsion. Reprimand and censure require 
majority votes, while it takes two-thirds of the House to expel a member. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Committee found that Frank had acted improperly by fixing 33 parking 
tickets, largely accumulated by Gobie while he drove Frank's car on personal 
business. In addition, the committee found that Frank wrote a 1986 memorandum 
on Gobie's behalf that contained "misleading statements" about Gobie and his 
relationship with Frank. The memorandum ultimately wound up in the files of a 
Virginia prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Frank wrote that he met Gobie through mutual friends, when in 
fact their relationship began in 1985 after Frank contacted Gobie through a 
male escort service. And Frank said in the letter that Gobie was adhering to 
the terms of his probation on drug and sodomy charges, when Frank in fact knew 
that Gobie continued to work as a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee rejected charges that Frank knew Gobie was using his Capitol 
Hill townhouse as a base for a prostitution ring. 
</P>
<P>
That assertion was rejected by Dannemeyer, who introduced a motion calling on 
the House to expel Frank. The Dannemeyer motion ultimately was defeated, 390 to 
38. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the California delegation who voted for expulsion along with 
Dannemeyer were Reps. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), Wally Herger (R-Yuba 
City), Duncan L. Hunter (R-Coronado), Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), Ron 
Packard (R-Carlsbad) and Norman D. Shumway (R-Stockton). 
</P>
<P>
Later, a motion offered by House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) that 
would have had the effect of censuring Frank failed, 287 to 141. Despite 
Gingrich's call for tougher sanctions, he termed the proceedings "tragic" and 
said that Frank "has been one of our brightest and most energetic members." 
</P>
<P>
Only four representatives have ever been expelled, three of whom were rebel 
sympathizers at the outset of the Civil War. The House has censured 22 members 
and reprimanded six. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan was among the members who joined Dannemeyer in attacking Frank. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother's a high school teacher. . . . This would have destroyed his 
career, anything even remotely resembling it," Dornan told Frank. "My prior 
careers: As an Air Force officer -- Out! Finished! As a broadcaster on 
television, if I wouldn't resign, I'd be fired. . . . I am going to vote for 
expulsion because you didn't have the honor and decency to resign." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer's assertion that the Ethics Committee had ignored evidence that 
Frank knew Gobie was using his home for prostitution brought an emotional 
response from Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
"You have just heard the most edited, selected garbage that's ever been put 
forth, in my opinion, in this House," Dixon said, his voice rising. Dannemeyer 
"insults the intelligence and literacy of the members . . . who have read the 
(committee's) report," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon also complained that Dannemeyer, in a letter circulated Wednesday to 
members of the House, had revealed the names of several "innocent witnesses" 
involved in the Frank case -- names that Dixon's committee had attempted to 
keep secret.

"Mr. Dannemeyer, you have done a mean and evil thing," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the votes, Frank said that he believes Dannemeyer's 
attempt to expel him was due largely to the fact that he is a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something about homosexuality that sets Mr. Dannemeyer to vibrating, 
I don't know what it is," Frank said. He added later: "I think that there is a 
growing sentiment in the House of Representatives that Mr. Dannemeyer and 
reality only rarely coincide."

SEAL MAKES A WRONG TURN IN ARCTIC OCEAN, VISITS SOUTHLAND

Southern California beaches attract all kinds of visitors during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, a special visitor from out of town -- way out of town -- arrived 
at Silver Strand beach in Coronado. That visitor is a 275-pound, 6-foot-long 
hooded seal -- one of a breed that makes its home only on the coasts of 
Greenland and northeastern Canada -- and her appearance here has local marine 
scientists perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
Since Monday, Sea World officials have had their hands full with the uninvited 
guest, who snapped at her handlers and turned up her snout at the first 
offerings of Sea World fare. 
</P>
<P>
The park officials could hardly turn her away, however, since she apparently 
swam 8,000 to 12,000 miles before beaching herself. 
</P>
<P>
"How she got here boggles the mind," said Jim Antrim, Sea World's senior 
curator for marine mammals. "No one has ever heard of one being found on the 
West Coast of America." 
</P>
<P>
Hooded seals are distinguishable by their large size, unusual markings and, in 
males, bulbous noses that flare out when the animals are agitated, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the female seal has all the telltale characteristics, park officials 
could hardly believe their eyes when they responded to a telephone call after 
the animal was sighted around noon Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she probably got here on her own," Antrim said. "The animal must have 
been exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
At first, the seal refused to eat and appeared to have an infection. But she 
has adjusted to the California lifestyle quite well, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
"She seems to be in pretty good shape to be so far out of her range," Antrim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hooded seals do have a history of wandering. Some have been sighted as far 
south as Florida and as far east as Portugal. Still, such trips are only 2,000 
to 3,000 miles out of the animals' natural habitat, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
To reach Pacific waters, this seal would have to swim across the Arctic Ocean, 
through the Northwest Passage and through the Bering Strait, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe that it swam through the Panama Canal," Antrim said.

<P>
TAXES: ANGRY LOTTERY OFFICIALS DEMAND WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMMERCIAL THAT IMPLIES 
THAT THE LOTTERY HAS NOT LIVED UP TO ITS PROMISES TO SCHOOLS.

State officials angrily demanded Thursday that alcoholic beverage interests 
fighting a proposed tax increase withdraw a television commercial that implies 
that the California Lottery has failed to provide the funds for education as 
its promoters promised. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne McNabb, communications manager for the California Lottery, said the new 
ads are misleading and inaccurate because they suggest that the lottery has not 
given any money to schools. In fact, she said, the lottery has poured $4 
billion into education coffers in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
She said that while the aim of the ads is to discredit Proposition 134, an 
initiative that would dramatically increase taxes on beer, wine and distilled 
spirits, it may actually do more damage to the lottery than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly could undermine public confidence and player confidence in the 
lottery and could therefore hurt the lottery's ability to raise money for 
education," she said. "In other words, this ad can cost schools money." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with Taxpayers for Common Sense, a political committee formed by the 
industry to oppose the tax increase proposals, said they would consider the 
withdrawal request. However, they said it would probably be several days before 
they make a decision and that the commercial will run in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
The ad tries to link promises made in a 1984 lottery campaign to those now 
being made by supporters of Proposition 134, who say the revenue from the 
higher alcoholic beverage taxes would be used to pay for programs to battle 
drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In the ad, an obviously exhausted schoolteacher looks up at the camera as she 
appears to be grading papers and says in a tired voice, "Remember those 
promises about all that lottery money for schools? I wonder where it all went. 
Well, now they're at it again with this foolish proposition." 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second spot is one of three commercials the organization is airing 
statewide in a new $1-million television advertising campaign. It is expected 
to run two to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Manter, the industry organization's executive director, said the ad was 
not meant to criticize the running of the California Lottery but to draw 
attention to claims that were made about the games of chance. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not trying to besmirch the reputation of the people running the 
lottery. That's the last thing we would do," Manter said. "The (1984) campaign 
is what we are talking about and the promises that were made that it was going 
to solve the (school) funding crisis, and it has not." 
</P>
<P>
But McNabb said that whatever the intent of the ads, the message they appear to 
convey is that the lottery is not providing money for schools. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that some people may have concluded from the campaign of 1984 
that the lottery would be a major funding source for education, but she said 
the Lottery Act itself was "very clear that the funding is supplemental to 
state revenues." 
</P>
<P>
"The lottery has more than fulfilled what the proponents and opponents said in 
their ballot arguments that it would raise for education," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot arguments predicted that the games of chance would raise $500 
million to $600 million a year for education. In the fiscal year 1988-89 the 
lottery raised more than $1 billion and in the last fiscal year raised $980 
million. The lottery revenue accounts for about 3% of school budgets and is 
distributed to local school districts by a formula based on student population. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 134, the initiative that prompted the ads, would increase the 
per-gallon tax on wine from a penny to $1.29; on beer from 4 cents to 57.5 
cents and on distilled spirits from $1 to $8.40.

HOUSE PASSES D.C. SPENDING BILL THAT ALLOWS FOR ABORTIONS

<P>
The House approved a District of Columbia spending bill Thursday that would 
allow the use of local tax revenues to pay for abortions for poor women. 
</P>
<P>
But the bill, adopted by a 241-178 vote, is likely to be vetoed by President 
Bush if it is passed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Bush twice vetoed the District of Columbia appropriations bill over 
similar abortion provisions. 
</P>
<P>
The new bill bars the use of federal government funds to pay for abortions 
unless the life of the mother is in danger or in cases of rape or incest. 
</P>
<P>
Bush last year objected to the use of federal funding for abortions in cases of 
rape or incest and also objected to use of local tax funds for unrestricted 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to override the vetoes, Congress eventually restricted payments for 
abortion to instances where the mother's life was endangered and Bush signed 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), an outspoken abortion foe, said White 
House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu told him Thursday afternoon that Bush would 
veto the bill over the abortion issue.

House Armed Services subcommittees on Thursday approved a cut of 129,500 in 
military personnel and authorized only one of two Seawolf attack submarines 
that President Bush had sought in his defense budget, lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel on military personnel and compensation agreed to reduce the Army by 
68,500 troops, the Navy by 20,000, the Air Force by 37,000 and the Marine Corps 
by 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction from the present strength of nearly 2.1 million troops is 
slightly higher than the 100,000 approved by the Senate Armed Services 
Committee in its version of the defense bill and about 3 1/2 times the total of 
38,000 in the President's proposed budget for the 1991 fiscal year, which 
begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The panel on sea power and strategic and critical materials, meanwhile, 
approved one SSN-21 Seawolf attack submarine. The Navy had planned to buy two 
at a total cost of $2.3 billion.

U.S. REMOVING NERVE GAS FROM W. GERMAN BASE

<P>
A closely guarded truck convoy Thursday began taking away a vast cache of 
deadly nerve gas secretly stored by the United States near this small West 
German town for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
West German authorities said someone phoned in a bomb threat against the toxic 
convoy but that the transport of the first shipment of nerve gas proceeded 
without any hitches. 
</P>
<P>
It was the beginning of the end for the United States' sole chemical weapons' 
depot in Europe -- a huge arsenal of 102,000 artillery shells covertly bunkered 
here since the Cold War days as a deterrent against Soviet aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Clausen residents breathed a collective sigh of relief while watching the 
removal of deadly chemical weapons whose existence they were told about just a 
few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The lethal cargo, destined for destruction on an atoll in the Pacific Ocean, is 
being removed under a 1986 U.S.-West German agreement. The operation is costing 
$83 million. 
</P>
<P>
A massive security operation guarded the cargo as a convoy of nearly 80 
military vehicles left the U.S. Army depot at Clausen. 
</P>
<P>
Police helicopters followed the convoy, and West German paramilitary squads 
stood in fields along the highway, or manned positions on overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
At Miesau, in the southwest, the containers are to be loaded onto special 
trains that will take them to Nordenham, on the North Sea, where they will be 
placed aboard U.S. Navy ships for transport to Johnston Atoll. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons will be destroyed at a later date in a specially built incinerator 
on the U.S. atoll, 800 miles southwest of Hawaii.

Cubans flocked to Revolutionary Plaza on Thursday night for an anniversary 
address by President Fidel Castro on Cuba's worsening economic situation and 
its changing relationship with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was the 37th anniversary of Castro's debut as a guerrilla fighter, 
an event commemorated with a three-day national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
On July 26, 1953, a small rebel force led by Castro forces attacked the Moncada 
military barracks in eastern Cuba, marking the definitive start of the armed 
fight against Fulgencio Batista, which culminated in the dictator's fall Jan. 
1, 1959. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban flag adorned buildings throughout the city, and the government-run 
news media exhorted citizens to attend the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Castro normally makes his July 26 address in a provincial capital but decided 
this year to speak in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department issued this statement on the anniversary: 
</P>
<P>
"Tragically, the revolution's promises with Castro's assumption of power in 
1959 were betrayed. There is little or no freedom of expression in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"The regime has just announced that it will no longer permit the International 
Committee of the Red Cross to visit Cuban prisoners. Three decades after the 
revolution, the Cuban people are paying a high price for Castro's devotion to 
the discredited Marxist model." 
</P>
<P>
Compared with the anniversary a year ago, the mood in this Caribbean island 
nation of about 10.5 million people now is far more uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Collapse of the friendly governments in Eastern Europe has brought an end to 
the socialist bloc. Grave uncertainty also has arisen about future economic 
ties with the Soviet Union, Cuba's chief benefactor. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Third World nations 
that the days of massive subsidies in the name of fraternal socialism are 
coming to an end and that the Soviet Union will observe the same terms of trade 
with all partners -- Communist or capitalist, friend or former foe. 
</P>
<P>
Castro has held out against making political changes in his one-party Communist 
state, but he has shown signs of economic flexibility, including moves for 
private Spanish investors to build hotels on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Castro has warned his countrymen that harsh austerity measures will have to be 
imposed if the Soviets stop sending 13 million tons of oil a year to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern is growing food scarcities. Many Cubans say they can't recall 
when food supplies have been more meager. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the government also has had to deal with a wave of break-ins at 
foreign embassies by asylum-seekers. Eighteen Cubans are at the Spanish Embassy 
and four at the Italian ambassador's residence. 
</P>
<P>
The government says they will not be granted safe passage out of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
For all his problems, Castro's rule still is without serious challenge. He 
continues to have a strong base of support, and representatives of the small 
dissident community here are either in prison or have been cowed into silence. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's foreign minister, Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, meanwhile, left Madrid 
for Peru to attend Saturday's inauguration of President-elect Alberto Fujimori. 
</P>
<P>
Castro also will be in Lima, at a time Spanish-Cuban relations have eroded over 
the asylum-seekers issue. But Fernandez Ordonez told reporters no request was 
made for a meeting with Castro nor did he foresee one taking place.

CASTRO STEPS UP ATTACK ON SPAIN OVER REFUGEES

<P>
Cuban President Fidel Castro on Thursday escalated his verbal abuse of Spain 
for accepting asylum seekers in its Havana embassy, further straining already 
bruised relations with the last European country willing to offer him financial 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Spain had expressed hope of cooling down the diplomatic crisis that erupted 
when 18 Cubans sought refuge in its embassy, although it continued to insist 
that the Cubans be allowed to leave. 
</P>
<P>
But in an almost three-hour speech before scores of thousands in Havana's 
sprawling Plaza of the Revolution, Castro added fuel to the diplomatic fire. 
</P>
<P>
Accusing Spain of adopting "measures that unite with the United States' 
economic blockade against Cuba," he said the Spanish have become "compasses of 
the United States" and referred to comments by Spanish officials on the crisis 
as "totally hostile and offensive." 
</P>
<P>
Castro dismissed Spain's symbolic suspension of a $2.5-million grant as 
inconsequential. "They needn't take it away from us -- we don't want it," he 
thundered to the crowd celebrating the 37th anniversary of the guerrilla raid 
he led in Santiago de Cuba, which began the Cuban revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Spain suspended the grant and recalled its ambassador last weekend after a 
bruising Cuban note called Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez 
an "anguished colonial overseer" suffering from "historical amnesia, 
paternalism and scandalous ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
"What good is economic aid if it is used as a money exchange for political 
ends?" Castro asked. 
</P>
<P>
The Castro speech surprised diplomatic observers who had been led to believe 
that the crisis over the embassy asylum seekers was almost over. Only hours 
before the speech, a Spanish diplomat in Havana told foreign journalists that 
he hoped calm would prevail so that serious discussions on the refugees could 
begin. "Most of them want to leave the country," he said of the 18, some of 
whom he indicated are suspected of being Cuban agents infiltrated into the 
embassy to stir up trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Castro made clear in his speech that Cuba will not relent in refusing to allow 
the asylum seekers to leave the country. "To tolerate something like this would 
be crazy," he said. "Anyone who enters an embassy in this manner will not be 
authorized to leave." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 18 Cubans still sheltered in the Spanish Embassy, there are 
four under asylum in the home of the absent Italian ambassador. Three others 
left the Swiss Embassy early Wednesday, and 19 more gave themselves up to Cuban 
authorities last week after occupying the Czechoslovak Embassy and a 
Czechoslovak diplomat's house.

An all-star prosecuting team made up of the country's leading radical reformers 
faced off Thursday against a leader of Russian ultra-nationalists on trial on 
charges of inciting anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
For Soviet liberals, the case has become an important battlefront in the fight 
against the growth of anti-Jewish activities, and two members of the Soviet 
Parliament and a leading trial lawyer joined the prosecution to focus public 
attention on the cause. 
</P>
<P>
But for Konstantin Smirnov-Ostashvili, the defendant, it was a little man's 
fight with the odds very much against him. 
</P>
<P>
"As an ordinary worker, I will find it difficult to stand up against the best 
brains of the country in court," Smirnov-Ostashvili, 64, an assembly-line 
worker at a Moscow munitions plant, told the packed courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Smirnov-Ostashvili won a week's recess from Judge Andrei I. Muratov to give him 
time to get a West German lawyer who, he hopes, will improve his chances 
against such formidable opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Before even one witness was called, the stakes of the case were already clear.

<P>
On one side of Courtroom 57 in the Moscow City Court sat Smirnov-Ostashvili, 
who leads one branch of Pamyat, a movement of Russian ultra-nationalists often 
accused of anti-Semitism. Accompanying him were his Soviet lawyer, whom he had 
tried to fire, and another Pamyat member who is helping with the defense. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side sat Yuri N. Afanaseyev, a leading historian; Yuri D. 
Chernichenko, a well-known journalist, and Andrei M. Makarov, a lawyer who led 
the defense of the son-in-law of discredited leader Leonid I. Brezhnev in a 
sensational corruption case two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The liberals are trying to demonstrate that the defendant is part of a large, 
powerful segment of society that threatens the process of reform. 
</P>
<P>
"My main goal is to show the character of the organization behind him and what 
danger it may pose to the country," Makarov said. 
</P>
<P>
"This trial will show the real degree of perestroika in the public thinking, or 
the absence of such perestroika," he continued. "Secondly, this will 
demonstrate the danger of organizations now underestimated by many. Thirdly, 
this will show that fascism is growing in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
The three are assisting in the prosecution under a provision of the Soviet 
criminal law that allows public participation in trials. Afanaseyev and 
Chernichenko are both members of the Congress of People's Deputies, the Soviet 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The defense is being assisted by Alexander S. Pobedinsky, a Pamyat leader who 
works in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Smirnov-Ostashvili is the first person in the Soviet Union to face charges of 
inciting ethnic strife, a criminal offense that could bring a sentence of up to 
10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
He is accused of leading a group of nationalists who disrupted a forum of 
Aprel, Writers for the Defense of Perestroika, in January. The intruders 
roughed up participants and shouted anti-Semitic slogans through megaphones. 
Smirnov-Ostashvili is the only one facing charges. 
</P>
<P>
The ultra-nationalists call the trial a test of democracy in a society where 
people have long been jailed for speaking their minds but are now promised 
freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
As a forum for the debate of some of the fundamental differences in Soviet 
society today, the trial has drawn crowds from both sides. On Tuesday, the 
first day, the spectators were so raucous that the judge adjourned the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Although Smirnov-Ostashvili failed to show up at court on Wednesday, his 
supporters and opponents argued loudly until the judge again adjourned the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
When Smirnov-Ostashvili entered the courtroom Thursday, at least half in the 
hall gave him a standing ovation, making plain where their sentiments lie. 
</P>
<P>
He asked to be excused for not appearing the day before, explaining that his 
wife fell ill after reading accounts of his case in the "yellow press." And 
then he demanded that the court appoint a censor to read future stories before 
they are published. 
</P>
<P>
Smirnov-Ostashvili's supporters said they are ready for the challenge of 
standing up to such a team of prosecutors. "Ostashvili has to go up against a 
lot of Goliaths," Alexander A. Kulakov, another leader of the 
ultra-nationalists, said. "But we are still sure we will win." 
</P>
<P>
Even spectators who did not support Smirnov-Ostashvili remarked about the 
obvious difference in stature between the defense and the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"On one side you have a simple worker," Eduard Neravnodushhny, 58, a 
metalworker, said during a break in the trial Thursday. "On the other side, you 
have some of the country's most famous intellectuals. . . ."

FBI AGENTS TARGETED BLACK LEADERS, BARRY LAWYER SAYS 
</P>

<P>
The FBI has a team of agents that targeted Julian Bond, Andrew Young and other 
black leaders for undercover sting operations, Marion Barry's lawyer said 
Thursday at the mayor's cocaine and perjury trial. 
</P>
<P>
R. Kenneth Mundy said the team operated in Atlanta, Chicago and California, as 
well as during the Jan. 18 sting in which Barry was arrested after being 
videotaped smoking crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI said in a statement that the charges were "unfounded" and 
"categorically denied." Assistant U.S. Atty. Judith Retchin added: "I think the 
allegations are outrageous . . . inflammatory." 
</P>
<P>
After testimony ended for the day, Barry told reporters as he left the 
courtroom: "I got the impression that Stern is notorious for going around the 
country trying to sting black elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
Mundy's contentions came as the defense neared the end of its case, questioning 
agent Ronald Stern, one of the participants in the Barry sting. The defense 
spent the day trying to prove that the FBI had entrapped Barry. 
</P>
<P>
"Stern in effect moves around the country as the head of an . . . assault force 
of FBI agents," Mundy said during a bench conference. 
</P>
<P>
The jury could not hear the discussion, and U.S. District Court Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson refused to allow Mundy to question Stern about the 
allegations. Mundy said he wanted to put his comments on the record in case 
there was an appeal in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to coming here to organize and orchestrate the sting against Mr. Barry, 
Mr. Stern had been in Atlanta trying to set up a sting of Julian Bond, Andrew 
Young and two other black politicians and public figures in Atlanta," Mundy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Bond, then the wife of former Georgia state Sen. Bond, told Atlanta 
police in 1987 that her estranged husband and other prominent officials had 
used cocaine. She recanted her story after a telephone conversation with 
then-Mayor Young. 
</P>
<P>
Bond denied using drugs and was never charged. Young, who faces an Aug. 7 
runoff for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, was criticized for calling 
Mrs. Bond. 
</P>
<P>
Mundy said the information came from two lawyers for government witnesses in 
the Barry case, a congressional office and a figure convicted in the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Mundy said the FBI approached a half-dozen women "in the life of Mr. Barry" and 
tried to get them to cooperate. "Money was offered to them," but the women 
refused, Mundy said.

N.J. COURT RULES RISK LABEL CAN'T SHIELD TOBACCO FIRMS;

LIABILITY: THE FINDING FLIES IN THE FACE OF SEVERAL FEDERAL APPEALS DECISIONS.

The health warnings on cigarette packs don't protect tobacco companies from 
liability lawsuits by smokers, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision runs counter to several federal appeals court rulings. Those 
decisions generally hold that the warnings, ordered by the government in 1966, 
absolve tobacco companies of responsibility in smokers' deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University in Boston and 
chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project, called the ruling the "most 
important positive development in tobacco litigation in the last decade." 
</P>
<P>
"This decision represents the consensus of scholarly opinion that these earlier 
decisions were wrong and it is very likely to be upheld by the U.S. Supreme 
Court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey high court also said changes in a 1987 state law on product 
liability do not rule out lawsuits filed before the law was passed. Tobacco 
company officials had taken the position that the law protected them 
retroactively from suits by smokers. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling will allow a 1982 lawsuit, filed by Claire Dewey of Wyckoff, to 
proceed. Dewey's husband, Wilfred Dewey, died in 1981 of lung cancer after 
smoking for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The man had smoked Camels, Tareytons and Viceroys, and his wife filed suit 
against the makers of those cigarettes, RJ Reynolds, American Brands and Brown 
&amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"We are unable . . . to decide that as a matter of public policy, manufacturers 
of cigarettes should be immunized from liability for the harms caused by their 
products," the court's opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, a New Jersey jury could decide that a cigarette manufacturer, 
rather than an injured party, ought to bear the cost of injuries that could 
have been prevented with a more detailed warning label than that required under 
the cigarette act," the opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Fyock, a spokesman for RJ Reynolds, said the ruling "flies in the face of 
decisions in the Supreme Court of Minnesota and five federal courts of appeal 
as well as numerous rulings in state and federal trial courts." 
</P>
<P>
Those rulings hold that the warning labels on cigarettes, and wide publicity 
about the health dangers of smoking, mean smokers were doing so at their own 
risk.

RED CROSS VOWS CLOSER SCRUTINY ON BLOOD BANKS

The American Red Cross announced Thursday that it will take corrective steps in 
response to a government report that found laxity in the tracking by blood 
banks of transfusion-associated AIDS and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
In a 60-page letter sent to the Food and Drug Administration, the Red Cross 
outlined how it would improve its methods for receiving, investigating and 
following up on reports of errors and accidents that come in from its 54 
blood-collecting regions. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a preliminary report by an FDA inspector found that the 
government had never been notified of 228 reports of transfusion-associated 
AIDS reported to the Washington, D.C., region of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
"A preliminary review of these cases has determined that almost all of the 
transfusions occurred before March, 1985, when the testing for the AIDS virus 
began. From the preliminary review, it also appears that these cases did not 
result from any erroneous release of blood products," the Red Cross said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS-causing human immuno-deficiency virus, or HIV, is spread by sexual or 
blood-to-blood contact, such as receiving a blood transfusion from another 
person.

2 DIE, 2 SURVIVE IN COLLISION OF AIR FORCE JETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two crew members were killed and two survived when two F-4 Phantom jets 
collided Thursday morning and crashed in the desert at Death Valley National 
Monument, George Air Force Base officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The jets were on a training mission when they crashed at 10:50 a.m., eight 
miles southwest of Furnace Creek, Death Valley's main tourist center, according 
to Tech. Sgt. Rick Corrall. 
</P>
<P>
Surviving the crash by ejecting from their jet were Capt. Wade J. Lujan, a 
pilot assigned to the 20th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, and Capt. Roland 
Molter, a weapons systems officer and West German national assigned to the 
First German Air Force Training Squadron at George Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the two dead crew members are being withheld until relatives have 
been notified. A search-and-rescue unit from China Lake Naval Air Station 
arrived on the scene shortly after the crash. Two other recovery teams from 
George Air Force Base in San Bernardino County also were dispatched by U.S. 
Army helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
The surviving crewmen were airlifted to China Lake, where they were examined 
and released. They were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials released no other details on how the crash occurred, 
pending an investigation.

Sunnyvale Mayor Brian O'Toole was charged Thursday with molesting a boy under 
the age of 14. 
</P>
<P>
O'Toole, 34, allegedly molested the boy between September, 1983, and January, 
1989, Santa Clara County Dist. Atty. Alan Nudelman said. "The acts underlaying 
the charges include fondling and oral copulation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Owner of an insurance business, O'Toole was elected to the City Council in 
1983. He served as mayor from 1985 to 1986 and was reelected mayor by the 
council last November for a two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. O'Toole will enter a plea of not guilty and we will vigorously litigate 
the matter," his attorney, Kenneth Robinson, said after O'Toole posted $5,000 
bail.

500,000 IN COUNTY TO GET NEW ZIP CODES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service will introduce new ZIP codes for about 500,000 San 
Diego County residents living south of Interstate 8 outside San Diego city 
limits, Postal Service spokesman Ken Boyd said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The new ZIP codes, which should be introduced early next year, will have a 919 
prefix, a code never used before anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego will remain covered almost entirely by ZIPs with 921 
prefixes, and the part of the county north of I-8 will continue to have 920 
prefixes. Those two ZIP prefixes are the only ones now in use in the county. 
</P>
<P>
ZIP is an acronym for Zoning Improvement Plan. 
</P>
<P>
The only residents and businesses affected will be those in South County and 
San Ysidro, which will change to a 92173 ZIP code. Many post-office box holders 
throughout the county have already received new ZIPs. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said, in what he termed "a very rough guess," that about 500,000 people 
will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
The change comes as postal officials are trying to streamline service in the 
county with automated sorting systems, machines that read ZIP codes and sort 
mail without human operators. 
</P>
<P>
Introduction of a new ZIP code was inevitable because of the rise in the area's 
population, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the postal service wants to have a second sorting plant operating by 
the end of 1993. Bids on that structure, to be located off Interstate 15 near 
Carmel Mountain Road, are scheduled to be taken in about a year. A sorting 
depot on Midway Drive near Lindbergh Field now handles mail for the entire 
county. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mike Cannone, postal service communications manager in San Diego, 
two things could happen once both plants are operating. The Midway Drive 
facility might sort just city mail and the new plant county mail. 
</P>
<P>
Or, the new plant might sort all mail coming into the county, while the Midway 
Drive plant would handle all mail going out of the county, which would make the 
best use of its proximity to the airport, Cannone said. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service will begin its official by-mail notification of the ZIP code 
change to residents and businesses within four weeks, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Ysidro, a community protest erupted two weeks ago after Postal Service 
letters to post-office box holders there mistakenly stated that the community's 
postal designation would be changed from San Ysidro to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
San Ysidro is one of two communities within the city of San Diego that does not 
already have a 921 prefix. The Postal Service meant to inform them that their 
their ZIP, not their city designation, would change. 
</P>
<P>
"The mistake was made by someone who didn't realize the sensitivity of the 
issue," Boyd said. "No wonder they were all up in arms." The people will get 
letters within a week alerting them to the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The ZIP code for street addresses in the heavily Latino community will change 
from 92073 to 92173, and post office boxes will be 92143. 
</P>
<P>
The only locale within the city of San Diego that will not have a 921 prefix is 
La Jolla, which will retain its 92037 ZIP for street addresses. 
</P>
<P>
Cannone said two things make La Jolla different -- the fact that it has its own 
postmaster, which San Ysidro does not, and its proximity to the other 920 
prefix locations. 
</P>
<P>
San Ysidro, on the other hand, will be wedged between 919 and 921 prefixes. 
</P>
<P>
"ZIP codes are assigned because of the political realities and the operational 
needs at the time," Cannone said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Coronado will retain its 921 prefix.

FALSE ENDORSEMENT CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The campaign of Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) responded to opponent 
Anita Perez Ferguson's call for "ethical and responsible leadership" in 
campaign fund-raising by zinging her for falsely claiming an endorsement by the 
Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter released Thursday, Reb Wayne, Lagomarsino's campaign manager, 
ignored a challenge by the Democrat to limit campaign spending to $400,000 
apiece as a symbolic rejection of the influence of special interests in 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne wrote that he could not take Ferguson's challenge seriously because her 
campaign released it to the newspapers before the congressman could respond. "I 
believe this makes your true intention quite obvious -- an attempt to grab a 
headline," Wayne wrote. 
</P>
<P>
As a parting shot, Wayne wrote that it was difficult to reconcile Ferguson's 
call for ethical leadership with the false claim in her campaign literature 
that her candidacy has been endorsed by the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is highly unethical to make such a false claim," Wayne said 
Thursday. "If this was simply an error, it is still a point that you cannot 
overlook. If candidates cannot manage their campaigns, how on earth are they 
going to manage a congressional office?" 
</P>
<P>
Sam Rodriguez, Ferguson's campaign manager, acknowledged the error in one piece 
of campaign literature distributed at the Santa Maria fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"That literature was a typo mistake by an intern," Rodriguez said. "Only 200 
copies were printed and placed at a table by an intern at the county fair. It 
was pulled right away and is no longer in circulation." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hattoy, a Sierra Club regional director in Los Angeles, said he has scolded 
Rodriquez about the erroneous campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't been endorsed, but I don't think the Ferguson campaign should be 
beaten up for distributing literature about an endorsement that they think is 
forthcoming," Hattoy said. 
</P>
<P>
To gain the endorsement of the Sierra Club, the largest environmental group in 
the nation with 400,000 members, a congressional candidate must win a 
two-thirds vote of members of the closest Sierra Club chapter and then a 
two-thirds vote of the club's national political committee in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Hattoy said the club's Los Padres chapter in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties 
has recommended that the national political committee endorse Ferguson's 
candidacy. But he said the national office will not take up the matter for 
another two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy Loyless, the club's assistant political director in Washington, said the 
Sierra Club has "never endorsed Lagomarsino because he has a poor environmental 
record." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Sierra Club endorsed Lagomarsino's opponent, state Sen. Gary K. 
Hart (D-Santa Barbara), and contributed $10,000 to his campaign. Ferguson, a 
former aide to Hart, announced her candidacy this year after Hart decided not 
to again challenge Lagomarsino. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Loyless nor Hattoy would speculate on whether the Sierra Club would 
endorse Ferguson or contribute money to her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Lagomarsino has far outpaced Ferguson in raising campaign 
contributions. As of June 30, he had raised $135,744 this year, bringing his 
total cash on hand to $151,343. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, a political newcomer, has struggled to match the fund-raising prowess 
of Lagomarsino or her former employer, Hart. Her June 30 finance reports show 
that she has raised $32,183 so far this year but has only $5,205 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising in this year's race starkly contrasts with that in the 1988 race 
for the 19th Congressional District, which straddles Ventura and Santa Barbara 
counties. Then, Hart raised and spent $1.6 million; Lagomarsino, $1.5 million. 
Their congressional contest was the most expensive in the nation.

MAVERICK SEAL FROM ANOTHER OCEAN DROPS IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Southern California beaches attract all kinds of visitors during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, a special visitor from out of town -- way, way out of town -- 
paid a visit to the Silver Strand beach in Coronado. The appearance of a 
275-pound, 6-foot-long hooded seal -- member of a species that lives only along 
the coasts of Greenland and northern Canada -- has local marine scientists 
perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
Since Monday, Sea World officials have had their hands full with the uninvited 
guest, who snapped at its handlers and turned up its snout at first offerings 
of Sea World fare. 
</P>
<P>
The park officials could hardly turn it away, however, since it apparently swam 
8,000 to 12,000 miles before beaching itself. 
</P>
<P>
"How she got here boggles the mind," said Jim Antrim, Sea World's senior 
curator for marine mammals. "No one has ever heard of one being found on the 
West Coast of America." 
</P>
<P>
Hooded seals are distinguishable by their large size, unusual markings and, in 
males, bulbous noses that have a hooded shape and flare out when the animals 
are agitated, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 3-year-old female seal has all the telltale characteristics, park 
officials could hardly believe their eyes when they responded to a telephone 
call after the animal was sighted by a passer-by around noon Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she probably got here on her own," Antrim said. "The animal must have 
been exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
At first, the seal refused to eat and appeared to have some sort of infection. 
Since then, it has adjusted to life in California, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
"She seems to be in pretty good shape to be so far out of her range," Antrim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hooded seals, once prized by hunters for their bluish coats, do have a history 
of wandering. Some have been sighted as far south as Florida and as far east as 
Portugal. Still, such trips are only 2,000 to 3,000 miles out of the animals' 
natural habitat, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the warm Pacific waters, this seal must have swum across the Arctic 
Ocean, through the Northwest Passage and through the Bering Strait, Antrim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe that it swam through the Panama Canal," Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
The whole scenario sounded improbable to Gerald Kooyman, a research 
physiologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that's impossible," Kooyman said when he heard about the park's 
visitor. "It's a remarkable occurrence. It's a surprise to me." 
</P>
<P>
Hooded seals are independent by nature, nursing for only four to seven days 
after birth, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Stewart, a staff scientist at the Sea World Research Institute, 
speculated that this seal may have forsaken its roots at a very early age. 
</P>
<P>
"This animal is still fairly young," Stewart said. "There's a tendency for 
young seals to wander. It may have been wandering for a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists still don't fully understand why species of seals generally choose 
to stay in one particular area, Kooyman said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no obvious barriers to them," Kooyman said. 
</P>
<P>
The seal could probably live just as happily in the 70-degree Pacific waters as 
its now-distant relatives do in 30-degree waters, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
At first, some officials speculated that the animal had been captured and 
released somewhere near the Coronado beach. But Antrim said the seal did not 
have any of the markings that are usually found on seals that have been 
transported in pools or cages. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the seal's initial refusal to eat dead fish and its hostility toward 
humans indicate that it probably had not dealt with people before, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
Where the seal's travels will take it next is unclear. Sea World officials plan 
to keep it for about two months to make sure it's in good health. Then the 
National Marine Fisheries Service will decide its fate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early in the rehab process to make a decision," said Joe Cordaro, a 
wildlife biologist in the Los Angeles office of the Marine Fisheries Service. 
"We're still in shock that it happened, period." However, Cordaro said it 
seemed likely that federal officials would elect to relocate the seal somewhere 
in the waters around Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sea World handlers have given the adventurous hooded seal a name: 
Robin, after the swashbuckling vagabond from Nottingham Forest.

MAN JOLTED BY OFFICER FILES $2-MILLION CLAIM; 
</P>
<P>
VENTURA: AN EPILEPTIC CHARGES THAT THE SHOCKS FROM A STUN GUN LED TO NIGHTMARES 
AND ANXIETY. HE PLANS TO PROCEED WITH A CIVIL RIGHTS SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An epileptic man filed a $2-million damage claim on Thursday against the city 
of Ventura and a Ventura police officer who repeatedly shocked him with a stun 
gun as he was recovering from a seizure. 
</P>
<P>
The claim by Donn Christensen Jr., 26, of Ventura is a step required by law 
before Christensen can proceed with a civil rights lawsuit that he plans to 
file in federal court, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen accused Officer Steven Mosconi in the damage claim of assault, 
false arrest and civil rights violations for using a 50,000-volt stun gun to 
force him out of his pickup truck and submit to handcuffing after Christensen 
caused a traffic accident during the seizure. 
</P>
<P>
The shocks have caused Christensen to suffer from nightmares, sleeplessness and 
anxiety, and may cause him post-traumatic stress disorder in the future, the 
claim said. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen said Thursday that he vomited in a patrol car after Mosconi 
arrested him and lost all feeling in his fingers for three days after he was 
handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
"I never believed in any of this stuff till it happened to me -- the stress and 
stuff that people go through from this," Christensen said. "It's hard to 
imagine." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office announced Wednesday that it would not file 
criminal charges against Mosconi. But Police Chief Richard F. Thomas said 
Mosconi violated department policy and will be disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas and Mosconi could not be reached Thursday for comment. Ventura City 
Manager John Baker said the city will not comment on the claim. 
</P>
<P>
But Baker added: "We'll handle it the same way we always handle a claim: 
They're reviewed by the city clerk and the city attorney and a decision is made 
on acceptance or rejection." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he does not know whether the city has ever paid a damage claim as 
large as $2 million. Christensen's attorney, Sanford Gage, said state law 
required him to file the claim before he can file a civil lawsuit against 
Mosconi and the city, which he plans to do in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen, a former Ventura County disc jockey, has been undergoing 
neurological and physical tests to determine if being shocked at least nine 
times by Mosconi caused him permanent nerve damage, Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen said he had to leave his job as a weekend disc jockey at KKUR-FM in 
Ventura after the incident because he was too nervous to concentrate on work. 
</P>
<P>
"A normal person might simply be stunned and might recover quickly, but 
epilepsy is the kind of condition that affects the electrical impulses set off 
in the brain," Gage said. "There's a little concern as to how that might affect 
him. The experience was very traumatic." 
</P>
<P>
Christensen said Thursday that nightmares now awaken him several nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nightmares basically of being assaulted, and oftentimes it's by a 
police officer. It's not even identifiable as a Ventura police officer; I guess 
you'd call it generic police officers," Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Each time, the nightmare officer attacks him with an object, Christensen said. 
"It's usually like a baton or a flashlight. It's interesting it's not a stun 
gun. I usually wake up sweating and shaking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The case began June 23 just after 6 p.m., when Christensen suffered a seizure 
at the wheel of his 1984 Ford Ranger pickup truck, which then swerved in front 
of oncoming traffic on Thompson Boulevard and caused two cars to collide. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:12 p.m., Mosconi arrived on the scene. According to his own incident 
report, Mosconi immediately was told that Christensen had suffered an epileptic 
fit, and that he had an anti-seizure medicine called Tegretol in the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Mosconi's report said he was concerned that Christensen, whose "eyes were red 
and glassy," would drive away and cause another accident. 
</P>
<P>
Mosconi demanded the keys from Christensen, who made a fist around the keys, 
"just glared at me and said no," his report said. 
</P>
<P>
After trying unsuccessfully to pull Christensen from the truck, Mosconi drew 
his Nova Spirit stun gun. He then demanded the keys and used the stun gun each 
time Christensen refused to surrender them -- shocking him six to eight times, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen finally got out of the truck, and, according to the district 
attorney's office and witnesses, Mosconi shocked him at least two more times as 
he stood passively. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mosconi's report does not mention any use of the stun gun after 
Christensen got out of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
The claim also alleges that while Christensen was in the hospital having blood 
drawn for drug and alcohol tests, Mosconi's partner told him that he was "very 
lucky" Mosconi wasn't more forceful with him -- and that police could file 
charges against him at any time within the coming year.

REGULAR USE OF MALATHION SURPRISES ENVIRONMENTALISTS; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: GROUPS IN THE COUNTY ASSAIL THE SPRAYING OF FARMLAND WITH THE 
PESTICIDE, WHICH IS USED ELSEWHERE TO FIGHT MEDFLIES. GROWERS SAY THE CRITICS 
ARE OVERREACTING.

<P>
After gearing up for a possible fight against aerial spraying of malathion if 
fertile Medflies are discovered in Ventura County, some environmentalists 
expressed surprise Thursday after learning that county fields have been doused 
with malathion for years. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark Councilwoman Eloise Brown raised the issue earlier this week in a 
public complaint that a helicopter pilot hired by Boskovich Farms had sprayed 
malathion on an 18-acre onion field near homes in Moorpark on Sunday to 
eradicate a bug called the thrip. 
</P>
<P>
Although the pilot was not required to inform city officials beforehand, Brown 
demanded that the city be notified whenever aerial spraying occurs. The 
farmland is owned by the city and leased to Boskovich Farms. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists elsewhere in the county said Thursday that they are disturbed 
that malathion is being sprayed on crops growing near homes, not only by 
Boskovich Farms, but also by other county growers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been waiting to know when Ventura County is going to spray malathion, and 
now I know it's already going on," said Paul Herzog, an environmentalist and 
member of the Conejo Valley Greens. "We've seen reports coming from L.A. County 
that people are getting sick from this kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Herzog, who also works with the Ventura County Food Safety Group, a coalition 
of growers, environmentalists and agriculture officials, said Boskovich Farms 
may not have broken any law, but the incident heightens the distrust homeowners 
have about pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a response to people feeling they're being bombarded from the sky," 
Herzog said. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Kirnig, a member of the Ventura County Environmental Coalition who 
lives in the Moorpark area, said she also was surprised that the Moorpark field 
was sprayed with malathion, a practice that could kill off beneficial insects. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people knew," Kirnig said. 
</P>
<P>
In eradication programs to wipe out the Mediterranean fruit fly in Los Angeles 
County neighborhoods, the effects of malathion spraying have raised a storm of 
protest. The Medfly is not yet a problem in Ventura County, but agricultural 
officials are worried that it will become one and have vowed to spray if 
fertile flies are found. 
</P>
<P>
In the Medfly program, the pesticide is mixed with a sticky bait intended to 
attract fertile insects and generally sprayed over wide areas that often 
include residential neighborhoods. As used in Ventura County against other 
pests, the water-based spray is more concentrated but is intended to be sprayed 
only on farmland. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion is one of 183 chemical pesticides used in Ventura County to protect 
crops from pest damage, according to county agricultural reports on pesticide 
use. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,558 pounds of the pesticide were sprayed in the county in 1988, a small 
percentage of the 2.8 million pounds of chemicals sprayed by local farmers that 
year, the most recent year for which figures are available. In 1988, malathion 
was used 76 times. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion is among the safest chemical pesticides, Deputy Agricultural 
Commissioner Dave Buettner said. 
</P>
<P>
Buettner said Ventura County growers have applied chemicals considered more 
toxic than malathion to their crops, including at least 18 other chemicals 
linked to birth defects or suspected of causing cancer. Those chemicals were 
listed in a Ventura County Grand Jury report on pesticides released earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, safety wise, they're using a material that is as safe as they can 
use," Buettner said, referring to malathion. 
</P>
<P>
The relative safety of the chemical when contrasted with known carcinogenic 
chemicals, however, failed to appease malathion opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Greene, a member of the environmentalist group Citizens to Preserve the 
Ojai, said he had heard previous reports of malathion spraying in the rural 
Ojai Valley. Despite assurances about the pesticide's safety, neighbors are 
concerned about exposure to malathion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to give the people who live there notice so that they can protect 
themselves," Greene said. "If there are any residents near where this is going 
on, they've got a right to know about it." 
</P>
<P>
One farm industry representative portrayed the response from environmentalists 
as an overreaction, given the number of other chemicals used to eradicate 
insects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably one of the most innocuous, but unfortunately because of all the 
publicity that's been received because of the Medfly infestations, malathion 
has received a bad rap," said Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura 
County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
At least one other environmentalist agreed that malathion has generated more 
public opposition than it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency has studied 50 cancer-causing pesticides 
used on produce, said Frances Scharli, president and founder of Mothers and 
Others for Safe Food, a consumer group based in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Scharli said she does not oppose aerial spraying of malathion. Homeowners who 
live near agricultural areas should view agricultural treatment of malathion 
differently than mass spraying of suburban neighborhoods, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not endorsing malathion. But if we're going to start targeting something, 
we need to start targeting known carcinogens," she said.

MEMORIAL SERVICE TO GIVE FINAL THANKS TO GOOD SAMARITAN

Gary Smith, the North Park carpet layer whose six-day fight for life drew the 
admiration of San Diegans after he tried to stop a burglary July 19 in 
University City, will be eulogized tonight. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service for Smith, whom the press dubbed the "good Samaritan," will 
be at 6 p.m. today at the Anderson-Ragsdale Mortuary, 5050 Federal Blvd., and 
will be open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 35, died Tuesday of four gunshot wounds he received at close range when 
he confronted the burglar. His heroics have been saluted throughout San Diego 
for the past week. 
</P>
<P>
"He always tried to help people. He was a hero. I can say I wish he hadn't done 
it, but you can't say that," said Sandra Budik, Smith's girlfriend and the 
mother of two of his three children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's heartwarming to know how much everyone cared. It helped a lot in such a 
horrible time," Budik, 27, said. Smith died on her birthday. 
</P>
<P>
During the past week, more than $27,000 in donations to defray medical expenses 
and assist Smith's family have poured into the Gary Smith Memorial Fund, 
established at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where he underwent five 
operations. More than 1,000 letters and cards also have been sent to Smith's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
"It's times like this that you really find out how people care," Budik said. "I 
wish to thank the people of San Diego for all the support, contributions, 
prayers and thoughts. It's been a comfort to the family." 
</P>
<P>
Smith has three children: Dominique, 7, a son from a former marriage; Kenny, 3, 
and Danielle, 9 months. Custody of Dominique will be given to his natural 
mother, Budik said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the San Diego Police Officers Assn. announced it had established 
a $1,000 scholarship fund for Smith's children, a practice usually reserved for 
children of officers killed in the line of duty. The group had already dipped 
into its blood bank and donated 21 pints of its reserved blood to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Although Budik had originally been identified as Smith's wife, she clarified 
the couple's relationship Thursday, saying they were not married but had lived 
together for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary and I were not legally married, but we considered ourselves married," 
Budik said. "We weren't trying to deceive anyone in any way at all. We were 
planning on getting married. We just didn't get a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Budik, a claims adjuster with Mercury Insurance for three years, said she 
doesn't think her salary will be enough to support herself and her two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Of the money donated to the Smith fund, hospital spokesman Mike Dabney said 
about $8,000 will be given to the Smith family for family expenses, and nearly 
$19,000 has been set aside to pay medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
Dabney said Smith's hospital bill is estimated at $100,000. Budik said MediCal, 
the Victim-Witness Assistance Program and other sources will be tapped. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had been installing carpet in the 7900 block of Camino Tranquilo when he 
heard screams from the building next door and chased a gun-wielding man before 
being shot in the face, stomach, left arm and right thigh, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Howard Pemberton, 22, was arrested last week in connection with the 
shooting and has been charged with murder, burglary, robbery, auto theft and 
possession of methamphetamine. Pemberton pleaded not guilty on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said it is considering filing for a finding of 
special circumstances, which would make Pemberton eligible for the death 
penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Pemberton "will pay for what he did. I'm glad they caught him," Budik said. 
"I'd rather see him in prison for the rest of his life so he can suffer a 
little bit." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Walker Smith, minister of the Christ United Presbyterian 
Church, will lead funeral services for Smith at Anderson-Ragsdale. The mortuary 
donated funeral services. 
</P>
<P>
Budik said the body will be shipped Saturday to Smith's hometown, Columbus, 
Ohio, for funeral services and burial.

<P>
MAN CHARGED WITH ASSAULT, KIDNAPING 
</P>

<P>
A Port Hueneme man was charged Thursday with five felonies in connection with 
the kidnaping and sexual assault of his housemate and her 7-year-old daughter, 
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury announced. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury's office filed a criminal complaint against Justo Dungca, 34, charging 
him with kidnaping, child molestation and attempted murder of the child, and 
kidnaping and sexual battery of the mother in connection with last week's 
alleged abduction. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office was expected to serve a warrant on Dungca on 
Thursday in Las Vegas, where he has been held without bail in the Clark County 
Detention Center since his arrest July 20, Deputy Dist. Atty. Vincent J. 
O'Neill Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
On July 19, authorities said, Dungca bound and gagged the girl and her mother 
and held them captive in his bedroom in Port Hueneme, where authorities said he 
sexually assaulted the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Dungca then forced the two into the woman's car and drove to Anaheim, where the 
woman managed to escape, authorities said. Dungca was found in Las Vegas the 
next morning as he tried to sell the car. 
</P>
<P>
As Las Vegas police closed in, Dungca grabbed the girl in a stranglehold and 
banged her head against the floor before officers could rescue her, said Lt. 
Greg Jolley, Las Vegas police spokesman.

MOTHERS' TREATMENT PROGRAM GETS GRANT

<P>
The Ventura County Health Care Agency has received a $1.8-million federal grant 
to establish a counseling and treatment program for chemically dependent 
pregnant women and recent mothers. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year grant from the Health and Human Services Department will pay for 
day care and live-in treatment for 20 women and their children at a time, said 
Stephen Kaplan, director of the county's alcohol and drug programs. 
</P>
<P>
He said as many as six of the women and their children will live in a safe 
house as part of the program. The rest of those in the program will continue to 
live at home. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major thrust for our agency and the county," Kaplan said. "Everybody 
is concerned about chemically dependent women at childbearing age. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the county's first attempt to pull all the necessary components 
together to work with these people from a health-care perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said the county is negotiating a lease for the program's day-treatment 
facility. A location has not yet been chosen for the live-in shelter, he added.

CONEJO VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
GARDEN IS A REFUGE FOR PLANTS, PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nestled between condominiums and a shopping mall, the Conejo Valley Botanic 
Garden, with its chaparral-covered hills and winding nature trail, is an urban 
refuge for both woodpeckers and people. 
</P>
<P>
Attracting an average of 60 plant enthusiasts, joggers and bird-watchers each 
weekend, the garden remains one of Thousand Oaks' best kept secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say the absence of a defined boundary makes the garden appear to be 
just an extension of its neighbor, Conejo Community Park. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer gardeners hope to clear up the confusion by installing a fence around 
the northwest portion of the garden later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the fence, about $3,000, will come from a recent $10,000 grant from 
Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
"With a fence, people will be corraled into the garden," said Barbara Song, 
treasurer of the nonprofit Gregor Mendel Botanic Foundation Inc., which manages 
the 35-acre grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We also need more signs because people get off in the wrong direction. We're 
hoping this will do it." 
</P>
<P>
The fence should also help reduce vandalism and create a protected area where 
gardeners can grow more sensitive plants. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the foundation has hesitated to exchange seeds with other gardens 
out of fear that the plants would never get a proper chance to sprout. 
</P>
<P>
Children who use the garden as a shortcut to and from school knock over 
sprinklers and plants, Song said. The gate on the fence will be locked at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say they plan to expand the collection, which includes olive trees, 
holly oak trees and Aleppo pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion will focus on drought-resistant plants so that the garden's 
twice-weekly watering schedule will not have to be increased. 
</P>
<P>
When the Conejo Valley Recreation and Park District was given the land in 1973 
by the Klingbiel Corp., it was little more than a hill covered with dry brush. 
</P>
<P>
The Gregor Mendel Botanic Foundation was formed to manage the grounds under a 
$1-a-year park district lease, said Jim Gilmore, development planner. 
</P>
<P>
With water provided by the park district, the foundation spends about $1,000 
annually on repairs, relying mainly on contributions and volunteers to expand 
and maintain the garden, Song said. 
</P>
<P>
The garden contains 200 species of plants and trees, including a small orchard 
and a section for succulents. The Conejo buckwheat, which is Thousand Oaks' 
official flower and is on the endangered list, has also found a home at the 
garden. STEPHANIE STASSEL

CASITAS DISTRICT SEEKS VIEWS ON WATER ALLOCATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Casitas Municipal Water District is asking the public to help decide how 
water will be allocated after the moratorium on new hookups is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to put this out at a public hearing to ask the people, the county 
and the cities how they think we should do this," board Vice President Laurence 
Whelan said during a directors meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The company serves western Ventura County and the Ojai Valley, and sells water 
to 14 other companies. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will be held at 3 p.m. Aug. 22 in the company's Oak View office. 
</P>
<P>
The directors are considering whether there should be a waiting list, if an 
applicant should pay a fee to get on the list, who should receive water first, 
how much water should go to existing customers, new applicants and agriculture, 
and how much should go to each area in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't want to get inundated with people who just want to get on the 
list," said John Johnson, district general manager. "And we don't want someone 
to be able to buy up all the water and then sell it to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
The company adopted a one-year ban on new hookups April 11 because it is 
running short of water from Lake Casitas to meet rising demand. It also asked 
the 14 water companies that buy Casitas water to adopt the same ban. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Casitas has been swamped with questions from builders, real estate 
agents, applicants and customers on how they can get in line for future 
allocations. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Curtis, general manager of the Ventura River County Water District, 
said he just laughs at water applicants and refers them to Casitas for answers.

SHIPYARD SUES BANK TO RECOUP PRINCESS LOUISE SALVAGE LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Terminal Island shipyard has filed suit against the Bank of San Pedro, 
seeking more than $6 million in damages from the former owner of the ill-fated 
cruise ship Princess Louise, which mysteriously capsized at the shipyard last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit by Southwest Marine Inc. claims that the shipyard lost $5 million 
in potential work because the sunken vessel occupied a berth at the shipyard 
for eight months. In addition, the suit alleges that the shipyard is owed $1 
million for salvaging and removing the vessel, and another $131,933 for repairs 
on the ship before it sank Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The cruise liner, built in 1921, is now resting in deep water outside San 
Pedro's main channel. It sank again June 20 en route to an ocean dump site off 
Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Marine's lawsuit, filed two weeks ago, had been expected since the 
bank sued the shipyard in May for allegedly sloppy repair work on the vessel. 
Bank President Lance Oak said Thursday that he considers the shipyard's lawsuit 
groundless. 
</P>
<P>
"We presented them with a ship that floated for more than 60 years, and while 
it was in their care and custody, it sank and became a total loss," Oak said. 
"So I find it hard to believe the bank should be held liable for any expenses, 
for any problems they caused themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the San Diego-based Southwest Marine and its attorney in the 
lawsuit, Daniel B. MacLeod of San Diego, declined comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The shipyard's lawsuit says that last Aug. 22, the bank solicited bids for 
repair work on the Princess Louise. The once-popular floating restaurant had 
been repossessed by the bank after its owner declared bankruptcy. Bank 
officials have said the repairs were necessary to sell the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 11, the lawsuit says, the bank and Southwest Marine entered into a 
contract for the repairs, with additional work added to the contract through 
the middle of October. The total bill for that work was $431,933, according to 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Since Nov. 9, when the cost of repairs was invoiced, the lawsuit says, the bank 
has paid the shipyard only $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
The balance still owed to the shipyard does not include Southwest Marine's 
other charges for wharfage, security, fire watch and other expenses associated 
with berthing the vessel, according to the lawsuit. No estimate of those 
charges was included in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the shipyard has alleged that the bank owes Southwest Marine for 
the $1,050,000 charged by a salvage firm to raise the Princess Louise and 
remove it from its berth at the shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that the bank was required to insure the vessel during 
repairs but did not, forcing the shipyard to cover the cost of salvage under 
its own insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
"After the sinking of the vessel, the bank refused to do anything or incur any 
expense or responsibility for salvaging the vessel or removing it" from the 
shipyard, the lawsuit says. Instead, it says, Southwest Marine paid for the 
salvage and removal of the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the lawsuit alleges that Southwest Marine lost an estimated $5 million 
in business while the Princess Louise occupied a repair berth at the shipyard 
for eight months. During that time, according to the lawsuit, Southwest Marine 
"lost the use of a major component of its ship repair facility" on Terminal 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the 330-foot vessel was finally towed away from the shipyard, it 
sank in the outer San Pedro Channel, far short of its intended destination off 
Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
After its sinking, officials at the Environmental Protection Agency said they 
wanted the vessel's salvager, Trinav Shipping Ltd. of Vancouver, Canada, to 
move the vessel to another location because it sank too close to an ocean dump 
site under the federal agency's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, EPA spokeswoman Lois Grunwald said the agency has made no 
final determination on what to do with the vessel. Likewise, she said, the EPA 
has not determined whether the ship could have been prevented from sinking 
until it reached Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA's inquiry is continuing, Grunwald said.

ANNEXATION SOUGHT TO SAVE SANTA MONICAS PARKLAND SWAP; 
</P>
<P>
JORDAN RANCH: VENTURA COUNTY WILL PROBABLY VOTE DOWN THE BOB HOPE LAND DEAL. 
SIMI VALLEY COULD GAIN FINAL SAY ON A DEVELOPMENT THAT MUST BE APPROVED TO 
SALVAGE THE PACT. 
</P>

<P>
Giving up on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, developers of the Jordan 
Ranch project have asked the city of Simi Valley to save a land swap involving 
entertainer Bob Hope by annexing about 5,900 acres of the controversial 
property. 
</P>
<P>
If the annexation goes through, Simi Valley would have jurisdiction over the 
property and thus have the final say over the 750-house Jordan Ranch project in 
the rolling hills of southeast Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The five county supervisors, three of whom have either pledged to vote against 
the development or have voted against it in the past, would lose control over 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the Jordan Ranch project must occur or the proposed land swap 
between Hope and the National Park Service will fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
Under the land-swap proposal, the National Park Service would exchange 59 acres 
needed for an access road to the Jordan subdivision for 1,100 acres of the 
2,308-acre ranch. In addition, Hope is donating and selling 4,600 acres in the 
Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains to park agencies for a below-market 
price of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Hope and for Potomac Investment Associates, which has an option 
on Jordan Ranch, proposed the annexation in a July 19 letter to the Simi Valley 
City Council. The council on Monday will discuss the proposal, which must 
ultimately be approved by the Local Agency Formation Commission, a five-member 
board made up of two county supervisors, two representatives of the county's 10 
cities and a public member. 
</P>
<P>
The 5,900 acres that would be annexed include 2,300 in Jordan Ranch just south 
of Simi Valley and 3,600 acres in Runkle Ranch to the northeast, said Julie 
Zeidner, a spokeswoman for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which buys 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Potomac officials and attorneys for Hope refused to comment Thursday on the 
annexation proposal. But proponents of the land swap said they support 
annexation because they believe the Jordan Ranch project stands a better chance 
of being approved by Simi Valley officials than by the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The election of slow-growth advocate Maria K. VanderKolk to the Board of 
Supervisors ruined the project's chances by providing the swing vote against 
it, Zeidner said. VanderKolk made her opposition to the project the centerpiece 
of her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
If the land-swap deal is lost, its supporters say, Hope will sell part of the 
property north of Simi Valley to the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, 
which has rated some of the area as an ideal site for a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best thing since sliced bread," said conservancy Chairwoman Carole 
Stevens of annexation. 
</P>
<P>
However, opponents of the project vowed to fight annexation with the same zeal 
they displayed while campaigning for political novice and long-shot VanderKolk, 
who won the election against incumbent Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer by 98 
votes. VanderKolk was out of the state Thursday and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been fighting for almost three years to save Jordan Ranch, and we're not 
giving up now," said Mary Wiesbrock, director of the environmental group Save 
Open Space. "It's just totally outrageous to make Jordan Ranch part of Simi 
Valley when most of the impact will be felt in Agoura Hills and Oak Park." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Jordan Ranch lies on Simi Valley's southern border. Simi Valley council 
members Glen McAdoo and Bill Davis -- two of the five city officials who will 
decide whether to ask LAFCO to approve the annexation -- said that if the land 
swap goes through, the city stands to gain a guarantee that thousands of nearby 
acres will be converted into parkland. 
</P>
<P>
"Strictly from a selfish standpoint, the land swap would be very good for the 
residents of Simi Valley," McAdoo said. "If in fact you are going to protect 
4,000 acres of open space, then it behooves us to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Councilwoman Vickie Howard, who represents the county's 10 cities 
on the LAFCO board, and Simi Valley Mayor Gregory A. Stratton said they will 
reserve judgment until they learn more about the annexation proposal. 
Councilwoman Ann Rock could not be reached Thursday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Schaefer and John K. Flynn are also LAFCO members. A spokesman for 
Schaefer said she was out of town Thursday and could not be reached for 
comment. Flynn, who last July unsuccessfully opposed a county study of the 
environmental effects of the project, said that annexation "was a giant end-run 
by Bob Hope" and that Hope "is becoming kind of a pain." 
</P>
<P>
Flynn said he did not see how Simi Valley could support annexation after 
announcing this week that it will sue the city of Los Angeles to block the 
massive Porter Ranch development in nearby Chatsworth. The council voted to sue 
Los Angeles under the Environmental Quality Act to try to block the $2-billion 
development, which will include 3,395 residences and 6 million square feet of 
commercial space. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials have said that taking legal action against Porter Ranch 
is necessary because concerns about traffic and smog have not been adequately 
addressed in the environmental impact report on the project. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that it would be a little difficult for the city of Simi Valley 
to side with this proposal after its reaction to Porter Ranch," Flynn said. 
"That seems inconsistent that they would even have this on their agenda." 
</P>
<P>
Both Davis and McAdoo said it is unfair to compare Jordan Ranch with the 
planned Porter Ranch development in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
"The two don't compare at all," McAdoo said. "This is not the monster Porter 
Ranch is. With Jordan Ranch you're talking about 750 homes with a golf course; 
with Porter Ranch you're talking about 6 million square feet of commercial 
space." 
</P>
<P>
Davis agreed, saying, "It's like mixing apples and oranges." 
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme Mayor Dorill Wright, who also represents the county's 10 cities on 
LAFCO, said that he has not made up his mind about annexation but that he 
believes the land swap is a "great deal in terms of preserving open space in 
perpetuity. So, you're caught in a dilemma -- the question is if the 
preservation is worth allowing any development." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Embry, LAFCO's public member, could not be reached Thursday.

Seven men were arrested Thursday on suspicion of attempting to kidnap and rape 
a teen-age girl after attacking her boyfriend outside a Newhall fast-food 
restaurant, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Saugus girl and her 20-year-old boyfriend, whose names were not 
released, were accosted about 1:30 a.m. by the men in the parking lot of a 
Carl's Jr. restaurant at Pico Canyon Road near the Golden State Freeway, Sgt. 
Gary Sinclair said. 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair said one of the men punched the girl's boyfriend in the head, dazing 
him, and then the assailants tried to force the woman into their pickup truck 
while tearing off her clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The girl struggled with her attackers, and when her boyfriend recovered from 
the blow he had suffered, he began to fight with them. 
</P>
<P>
The girl broke free, and she and her boyfriend ran back into the restaurant. 
The men fled in the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the restaurant, the couple saw deputies had pulled the pickup 
over for a possible traffic violation, Sinclair said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple told the deputies what had happened and two suspects were arrested. 
The other five fled on foot. After a search involving helicopters and police 
dogs, they were found hiding in bushes. 
</P>
<P>
All seven were booked at the Santa Clarita Sheriff's Station on suspicion of 
attempted kidnaping, sexual assault and battery. They were held in lieu of 
$10,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
They were identified as Jose Gonzalez, 19; Oscar Zenteno, 19; Sergio Zenteno, 
24; Armando Rodriguez, 25; Augustin Vasquez, 23; Jose Fuentes, 23; and Jose 
Munoz, 21, all of Newhall.

RICHARD R. LEWIS; INSURANCE AGENT, RETIRED FIREFIGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard R. Lewis, a longtime Lake Hughes resident noted for his community 
involvement, has died in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year veteran of the Los Angeles Fire Department died Monday of a heart 
attack suffered at his insurance agency, said his son, Randy Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Born Feb. 28, 1920, in Los Angeles, Lewis moved to the Antelope Valley as a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1938 and served in the Army 
Air Corps during World War II as a technical sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a Los Angeles firefighter, Lewis joined the Fire Department in 1948 
and worked downtown, and in stations in East Los Angeles, Van Nuys and 
Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
He received a bachelor's degree in public administration in the mid-1950s from 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, he opened an insurance agency bearing his name in Lake Hughes. Lewis 
retired from the Fire Department in 1979 with the rank of battalion chief and 
continued selling insurance until his death. 
</P>
<P>
He also owned and managed a fruit ranch, the Pine Canyon Cherry Farm, in Lake 
Hughes.

MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN $12-MILLION FRAUD CASE; 
</P>
<P>
SCHEMES: PROSECUTORS SAY MOST OF THE MONEY GATHERED BY ALAN KERANEN WAS USED TO 
PAY INTEREST TO EARLIER INVESTORS AND TO SUPPORT HIS LAVISH LIFESTYLE.

A former high school football coach who operated a Ponzi scheme that bilked 
nearly $12 million from more than 200 unsuspecting investors pleaded guilty 
Thursday to two counts of mail fraud and two counts of submitting false tax 
returns to banks. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Keranen, 42, formerly of Woodland Hills, admitted to U.S. District Judge 
William Matthew Byrne Jr. that he siphoned off money from the Woodland 
Hills-based California Anchor Group for his personal use, U.S. Dist. Atty. 
Anita Dymant said. 
</P>
<P>
California Anchor, founded by Keranen in 1983, was intended to be a real estate 
investment company developing and selling apartment buildings in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Lured by promises of a 25% return on their money, investors refinanced their 
houses, cashed in their IRAs and spent their nest eggs to get in on the 
venture, according to prosecutors and victims. 
</P>
<P>
But Dymant said most of the money went toward paying interest to earlier 
investors and to support Keranen's lavish lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
She said Keranen paid for his sprawling Woodland Hills house, a condominium at 
a Utah ski resort and a residence for his mother with money that he took from 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
Only a small fraction of the investors' money was ever placed in real estate 
ventures, Dymant said. 
</P>
<P>
Keranen had no difficulties recruiting investors because of his success in the 
Amway organization, a multilevel marketing company that sells cleaning products 
and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
With his positive attitude, Keranen was a popular speaker on the lecture 
circuit, where he told of recovering from a devastating bus accident to build a 
fortune, according to victims. 
</P>
<P>
He also sold motivational tapes with such titles as "You Too Can Be a 
Millionaire." 
</P>
<P>
Other Amway distributors interpreted his success as a sign of business acumen 
and were eager to get involved in his real estate development venture, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
But the pyramid scheme collapsed in May, 1987, two months after Keranen was 
asked to leave Amway for violating the company's rules against involving too 
many other distributors in non-Amway business. 
</P>
<P>
Once Keranen was forced to leave Amway, "word spread like wildfire," Dymant 
said, and Keranen could not attract any new investors. 
</P>
<P>
Keranen has since moved to Beaverton, Ore., and is running a water filtration 
marketing firm called Double Win International. 
</P>
<P>
Nine civil lawsuits -- with more than 100 plaintiffs -- have also been filed 
against Keranen's estate, now in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing has not been set for Keranen, who faces a maximum of 14 years in 
state prison and up to $510,000 in fines.

CITY PANEL TENTATIVELY OKS SHIPYARD LEASE, CHIDES HARBOR DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee has tentatively approved a new lease with 
Terminal Island's largest commercial shipyard, but not without some harsh words 
for the Harbor Department's handling of the company and the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 10-year lease with Southwest Marine Inc. drew criticism Tuesday 
from the council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee because the 
agreement has been in negotiations since 1986 and falls short of the 20-year 
lease sought by the shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who chairs the committee, said she 
was particularly sensitive to Southwest Marine's position, because it is the 
last large shipyard in Los Angeles Harbor. "They're so vital to the community. 
If we lose that shipyard, it's almost over," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The lease with Southwest Marine to operate at berths 240Z-241 was scheduled for 
action in early 1986, according to a report to the committee. But the 
negotiations dragged. During the talks, Southwest Marine has been paying rent 
on a month-to-month basis for use of the 18-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the port's staff agreed to the shipyard's request for a 20-year 
lease and the port commission said it would consider such a lease if Southwest 
Marine made significant capital improvements to the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
But the port's staff later recommended a 10-year lease, arguing that a new dry 
dock purchased by Southwest Marine, at a reported cost of $24 million, was a 
moveable asset that could be taken away if the company relocated its shipyard. 
They also recommended that the rent be renegotiated after five years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the lease, which is retroactive to 1986, the shipyard would 
pay $74,000 a month during the first five years. The rate for the last five 
years would be set next year. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by the council committee, Mark Richter, the port's assistant 
property manager, acknowledged that negotiating the lease had taken more time 
than port officials had expected. He also said the proposed agreement offered 
the shipyard less than it wanted. "They're not delighted, but they're certainly 
satisfied," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the council committee members were not. "So the lease is only good for six 
years?" a surprised Council President John Ferraro asked port officials. 
</P>
<P>
Added Flores: "I think it's ridiculous that you have to renegotiate for the 
other five years" on the proposed lease. 
</P>
<P>
Although it tentatively approved the lease, the committee, at Flores' urging, 
did not schedule the agreement for final approval before the full council. That 
action would be taken, she said, only after the committee hears from the 
shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Shipyard officials declined comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Marine, which employs 870 workers, opened its Terminal Island 
facility in 1981, taking over the site vacated by Bethlehem shipyards.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people were injured and one was killed when gunshots were exchanged at a 
home in East San Diego during a drug buy, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Shots were heard coming from a residence in the 4000 block of Van Dyke Avenue 
at 11 p.m. Wednesday, homicide Lt. Paul Ybarrondo said. 
</P>
<P>
Police found Benjamin Merritt Jr., 23, next door to where the gun battle 
erupted. He was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center, where he died of gunshot 
wounds in the chest and abdomen, the medical examiner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Police also found Melisa Evans, 18, across the street from the residence with a 
minor gunshot wound in her right thigh. James Smith, the resident of the home, 
received a bullet wound in his left leg. Both were taken to UC San Diego 
Medical Center and were listed Thursday in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarrondo said Evans had gone to the home to buy drugs. While inside, two or 
three men broke in and a struggle followed, with shots being fired. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, armed with a 9-millimeter automatic, shot at the intruders and struck 
Merritt, Ybarrondo said. One of the intruders shot Smith with a .25-caliber 
automatic pistol, he said. Police are unsure who struck Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Police found Merritt near the gate of an apartment complex next door to where 
the shooting occurred. He died at 11:35 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made, Ybarrondo said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN YSIDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two security guards at a San Ysidro trailer park were arrested after they posed 
as immigration officers and robbed three illegal immigrants, San Diego police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The three immigrants were taken to the security office of the Border Village 
Trailer Park in the 1100 block of San Ysidro Boulevard shortly after midnight 
Thursday and robbed of $115, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Carter, 23, of National City and Tommy Corley, 20, of San Diego were 
arrested by police on suspicion of kidnaping, robbery and unlawful arrest and 
were held at County Jail after being identified by the three men, Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The undocumented migrants, all from Colima, Mexico, had crossed the border on 
foot and were stopped by the security guards as they were walking through the 
trailer park, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that, once the men were released, they called police who made the 
arrests about 1 a.m. Thursday.

Rolling Hills has banned mountain bikes and all other wheeled vehicles from the 
24 miles of equestrian trails that wind through the private, gated community. 
</P>
<P>
Council members unanimously adopted the law Tuesday after equestrians cited 
several instances in which horses had been spooked by cyclists. The council 
feared that serious accidents could result if cyclists continued to use the 
trails. Motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles were already banned from the 
trails. 
</P>

Violators of the ban, which takes effect immediately, could be fined $500 or

LAX BUTTERFLIES, INGLEWOOD WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter is mentioned (Times, July 15) as 
offering a plan to turn 200 acres of the Los Angeles International Airport sand 
dunes into a nature preserve, thereby protecting the endangered El Segundo blue 
butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
On the same page it was revealed that Inglewood tentatively approved a 
five-block-long, eight-foot-high wall on West Boulevard along the Inglewood-Los 
Angeles border to protect itself from crime spilling into the neighborhoods 
from the Los Angeles side. 
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that this part of Los Angeles falls within Councilwoman 
Galanter's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Inglewood and Los Angeles citizen groups tried to contact the 
councilwoman about this area and the dismal condition it is in. Just a few 
months ago, one of Inglewood's volunteer organizations had a meeting with one 
of the councilwoman's deputies regarding this location. Recently a group of Los 
Angeles-Florence area residents met with the same deputy, discussing the same 
subject. The results, as always, have (ranged) from lip service to nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
While it is commendable to show concern about the environment, it also would be 
commendable to show compassion and actions for people and conditions in other 
parts of the councilwoman's district.

STUDENT'S MURALS PAINTED ON PUBLIC WALLS DESIGNED AS POLITICAL STATEMENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The darkly clad figure donned gas mask and surgical gloves to begin his 
testament against gang violence, with night as his only protection. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with a dozen spray cans, Brett Cook produced his vision of a sneering 
gang member who had just punched a rival, causing blood to spurt from his 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Beside the two painted figures he wrote the words of rapper Kool Moe Dee: "I 
never ever ran from the Ku Klux Klan and I shouldn't have to run from a black 
man." 
</P>
<P>
In the process, a graffiti-covered wall in East San Diego was transformed into 
a mural. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, 22, an art student at the University of California, Berkeley, grew up 
close to this spot in the 5400 block of Chollas Parkway. "The neighborhood has 
changed a lot since I've lived here," said Cook, his voice muffled behind the 
mask. "It's gotten a lot more run-down. This piece has become more relevant." 
</P>
<P>
It was 3 a.m. and a car passed by, its headlights temporarily stealing Cook's 
veil of secrecy. The artist froze. 
</P>
<P>
Several feet away, a man began banging a drainpipe and spouting obscenities to 
no one in particular. "It's a strange feeling out here," Cook said, listening 
to the eerie reverberation. 
</P>
<P>
"You're doing something illegal. You're so alone . . . but you're scared you're 
not." 
</P>
<P>
The man wandered away, and Cook seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. Cook 
explained that his mission is to spread understanding among blacks and 
tolerance among ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
He's chosen to do this by painting unauthorized murals on freeway overpasses, 
slabs of concrete or walls. 
</P>
<P>
Home from Berkeley for the summer, Cook painted a self-portrait on a hunk of 
concrete off Interstate 5, just north of the Pershing Street off-ramp. The work 
declared, "Open-mindness is not a weakness. It is a strength. How strong are 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
It was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Another mural he made on Interstate 5 features an Italian-American man and 
African-American man nose-to-nose with an American flag draped behind them. 
They are separated by the word Bensonhurst, the name of the New York suburb 
that became the focus of national attention after a black man was attacked and 
killed by a group of whites a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Cook's themes spring from his biracial background. As the son of Al Cook, a 
black who is a San Diego Unified School District assistant superintendent, and 
Jan, who is white and serves as head counselor at Horace Man Junior High, Cook 
was torn between two worlds. 
</P>
<P>
"You like to dance and play basketball, you're not really white. You like the 
beach, surfing and wearing O.P. clothing, you're not really black. I became 
faced with dealing with my ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
"People were always wanting me to make an allegiance. I didn't want to do that; 
it was a difficult thing I had to struggle with. Finally, I came to a strong 
positive conclusion (to the question) of, 'What are You? I'm both,' " said 
Cook, whose dreadlocks were covered by a blue baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's given me an understanding about people and it relates to my 
work." 
</P>
<P>
His work, however, is not endorsed by everyone who comes across it. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said that the San Diego Police Department will 
prosecute people found painting on private or public property without 
permission. Such defacement is considered a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum 
fine of $600, or six months in county jail, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's vandalism," Robinson said. "What you might perceive as art could be 
malicious vandalism to someone else -- especially if it's on 
</P>
<P>
your house or on your property." 
</P>
<P>
Cook said he believes the importance of his artistic themes overshadows the 
stigma of their illegal placement. 
</P>
<P>
And he said he only creates murals on public property, not private businesses 
or residences. 
</P>
<P>
"If I do something about sexual discrimination on a freeway overpass, and you 
have to drive off that ramp every day, you're going to have deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
"If I do a piece on racism on a parking lot wall where you park every day, 
you're going to have to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
A graffiti-art authority said there are signs that his art is being well 
received. A San Francisco piece he did depicting two black men fighting over a 
flesh-colored crayon was left undisturbed for four months, "at a time when 
nothing lasted a week," said Jim Prigoff, the Sacramento-based author of Subway 
Art, which details the history of spray art. "It got a lot of respect. People 
were taken by it." 
</P>
<P>
And, after Cook completed his Bensonhurst piece, someone sprayed a silver frame 
around it. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody recognized it was important," said Prigoff. 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti art became popular in New York in the 1980s, when respected New York 
art museums and commercial galleries began to exhibit work by artists who also 
painted murals on subways and public walls. 
</P>
<P>
Among the best known of these artists is the late Keith Haring, a 
formally-trained artist who used black paint and chalk to create works on 
advertising panels in New York subway stations. 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti and spray art in public places thrive to this day in many cities, 
including San Diego. But Prigoff said there is a difference between gang war 
graffiti and the work Cook produces: "Brett is creating very politically 
sensitive people in this art form." 
</P>
<P>
According to Cook, spray art "has been equated with youthful thugs and street 
urchins to deface property. One should ask questions and do it in the medium 
that comes with the baggage of being rebellious." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Cook has taken his art form into a legitimate arena, with an exhibit at 
the Java Coffeehouse/Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
To Cook, the characters in his mural at Java represent the downtown coffee 
shop's trendy clientele. 
</P>
<P>
"In a place like Java, people are consumed with appearance and trends. They're 
not looking or listening to what's going on," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Java owner Doug Simay was concerned that his patrons might be 
offended by the exhibit, which features a list of questions including, "Do you 
accept people for what they are, unless they wear light clothing?" 
</P>
<P>
"He was raising issues and then he raised counter-issues," Simay said. "It is 
an innovative exploration that is non-critical and thought-provoking." 
</P>
<P>
When murals are sprayed outside, "You never know who the audience is you're 
speaking to, or how big it is," Simay said. However, with gallery artwork, "the 
audience is no longer faceless. The audience can defend (the artist) or he can 
be held accountable." 
</P>
<P>
While Simay said response to Cook's exhibit has been mostly positive, there has 
been some negative reaction to a reproduction in it of a mural Cook made in San 
Francisco for Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
Some have suggested it's hypocritical to use aerosol paint because it 
contributes to depletion of the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Cook objected to the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"When you do a drawing, they cut down trees for the paper. When you use 
cadmium-colored paints, they have a lot of lead in them. Art, regardless of the 
medium, is toxic and harmful to the environment. It's our concession as 
artists. We're making art not only to express ourselves, but (in this case) to 
help other people understand gang violence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The urge to draw on walls hit Cook while attending Crawford High. A one-day 
suspension was his punishment for one mural. 
</P>
<P>
Cook also was arrested by campus police his first year at Berkeley, but no 
charges were brought against him. 
</P>
<P>
Cook plans to graduate next year, then seek a master's degree. Eventually, he 
wants to teach college. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, he hopes his artwork will provide enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fairly certain this won't last long," he said, shining a penlight on his 
completed work as the twitter of sparrows signaled the dawn. 
</P>
<P>
"My idealism says it's worth it. People are being changed."

Art's grappling attempts at meaning can be staged anywhere -- in the coffee 
house as well as in the gallery. In Brett Cook's current show, art adds its 
voice to the existing social and intellectual dialogues at Java Coffee 
House/Gallery to reveal a confluence of concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Cook's "Social Questions in a Medium of Question" prompts patrons at the coffee 
house to reconsider their place in the social spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, a San Diegan studying art and education at UC Berkeley, practices 
"aerosol art." More commonly and pejoratively known as graffiti, Cook's 
spray-painted murals are, in his words, "an exercise of global citizenship." 
They address universal questions in immediate, accessible terms, using the 
cheapest available materials -- spray paint and existing walls. 
</P>
<P>
Cook has created more than 20 murals throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, and 
several are documented in color photographs at Java. They lament the abuse of 
the environment, internal tensions in the African-American community and the 
persistent perils of racism. 
</P>
<P>
Though Cook's aggressive use of public spaces gives the work an edge of 
rebelliousness, the images themselves feel tired and trite. They shout their 
messages with the immediacy and directness necessary to be grasped at street 
level, but they leave little for the mind to ponder. They phrase pressing 
social and environmental issues in an all-too-familiar manner. 
</P>
<P>
Like an entire generation of "aerosol artists" who came of age in New York in 
the '80s, Cook is trying to bridge the gap between gallery and graffiti by 
making self-contained panel paintings in addition to his fleeting expressions 
on the street. Although Cook's street work tends to sell the viewer short, his 
two large paintings on wood panels, created specifically for Java, leave a bit 
more to chance and the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Three laughing, overlapping Asian faces dominate one of the paintings, with the 
words "impression," "appearance," "trend" and "arrogance" applied to the 
surface in cut-out letters. The words provide a filter through which to 
perceive the faces, while spelling out the very obstacles that often block our 
perception of others -- the reliance on first impressions or superficial 
appearances, a dependence on fashion and a haughty disregard for the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Cook's other painting juxtaposes three faces that stare forward placidly, with 
one whose teeth are clenched and eyes clamped tight in tension. 
</P>
<P>
Here, the words "openmindedness," "respect" and "learning" float across the 
surface -- keys, perhaps, to the peace embodied in the three calm faces. 
</P>
<P>
The imagery in both of Cook's paintings tends toward the bland, but a few 
potent words anchor it to the turbulent sea of social critique. At this stage 
in Cook's work, the connection is tenuous, but the idea is promising.

'CRUX OF MATTER' WEAVES TIGHT WEB OF SYMBOLISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
People, Cheryl O'Neill asserts in a statement for her exhibition in Bard Hall 
at First Unitarian Church in Hillcrest, are "the centers of meaning." Humans 
are the mediating forces between vast, abstract chaos and the structures and 
beliefs that shape our lives. 
</P>
<P>
The show, on view through today, examines the range of ways -- from scientific 
to spiritual -- that humans have interpreted their world. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, who lives in Encinitas, makes her point well in the dense montage of 
images and text that spans her 40-foot scroll drawing, "The Crux of Matter." 
Examples of the symbols, maps, diagrams and systems that serve as our guides 
through the phenomena of existence are tightly knit in O'Neill's drawing, and 
their placement in relation to one another reveals much about the artist's own 
sympathies. 
</P>
<P>
She contrasts Urana, an ancient goddess, with Vanna White, the starlet of a 
television game show, to expose the shallowness and absurdity of our 
contemporary pantheon. She mourns, implicitly, a way of life in affinity with 
the natural rhythms of the earth. In our era, she writes, the summer solstice 
is the time to celebrate such nationalistic, militaristic holidays as Flag Day 
and the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
Such ironies and tragedies surface throughout O'Neill's scroll, whether her 
focus is environmental pollution or rampant materialism. The quantity of 
material she presents, including numerous excerpts from weighty, theoretical 
texts, can be daunting, but skeins of relevance and poignancy can be extracted 
from this tapestry with ease. 
</P>
<P>
Blueprints for the scroll are also on view, as are several related paintings, 
but they add little to the thrust of O'Neill's meaningful message.

The Teamsters Union and United Parcel Services of America Inc. agreed to extend 
a deadline for voting on a new contract, delaying the threat of a nationwide 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
The union initially told the company, headquartered in Greenwich, Conn., it 
would strike if a new three-year contract wasn't approved by next Tuesday, when 
the old pact expires, a UPS spokesman said. But he said the union needed more 
time to get all its members to vote on the proposal. The deadline for ratifying 
a contract was pushed up to Aug. 10 from next Monday.

Federal prosecutors said in New York City that they have closed an eight-month 
investigation into Mayor David N. Dinkins' sale of cable stock to his son and 
will not file criminal charges. In a brief statement, prosecutor Andrew 
Manloney said the investigation "has been completed without the filing of 
criminal charges." Questions centered on whether Dinkins gave 588 shares of 
Inner City Broadcasting Corp. stock to his son, David Jr., through a genuine 
transaction, how much it was actually worth and whether taxes were fully paid 
on the deal.

The nation's death rate from asthma has increased by more than 30% in seven 
years, and nearly 10 million Americans are now affected by the chronic disease 
characterized by difficulty in breathing, the national Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta reported. Officials said a number of factors -- including 
exposure to infections and other "triggers" for bronchial constriction, 
health-care factors and air quality -- may contribute to the increase. Between 
1980 and 1987, the death rate from asthma in the United States rose from 1.3 
per 100,000 population to 1.7, according to the CDC.

AL DAVIS: O'MALLEY FOR THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the start of a new football season, here's a letter to some of those who 
are trying to understand Raider owner Al Davis: 
</P>
<P>
Dear Bashers: 
</P>
<P>
It can be safely speculated today that many of you have never met him. In the 
main, your perceptions could have been formed only by his critics. 
</P>
<P>
For the Davis case is even stranger than it seems. Much of reality differs from 
much of the common understanding. 
</P>
<P>
To judge him fairly, as he searches for a new home for his football team, 
requires a context of two truths in particular: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The first is that Davis represents Los Angeles' best chance, perhaps its 
only chance, to get the modernized Coliseum the community needs. Until the 
Coliseum is expensively improved, no other NFL tenant will consider it, and 
indeed it's likely that, next time, even the Olympics would reject it. 
</P>
<P>
Even an expansion team is out. If the Raiders leave Los Angeles, the NFL, 
coveting Washington support for its views on antitrust policy, won't antagonize 
Congress by placing a fifth pro club in California when Tennessee, Alabama, 
Maryland, Missouri, Oregon and so many other states have none. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The second truth about Al Davis is that, contrary to repeated public 
allusions, it isn't greed that drives him, but need. The general impression is 
that he is a highwayman holding up Oakland or Los Angeles or both for personal 
gain. The actuality is simply that his football team needs a more competitive 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The condition of the Raiders today is almost identical to that of the Dodgers 
in Brooklyn 33 years ago, when that club's owner, Walter O'Malley, couldn't 
generate enough revenue in an inadequate stadium to compete satisfactorily 
against the dominant teams of his day. 
</P>
<P>
The 1950s Dodgers, like the Raiders in Oakland a quarter-century later, tried 
to interest the politicians around them in their predicament. But when O'Malley 
spoke to Brooklyn and New York, only Los Angeles listened. 
</P>
<P>
And when the taxpayers of Los Angeles joined their 1950s leaders in agreeing to 
invest in a place for O'Malley to play, militant New Yorkers condemned not them 
but him, using the same word that so many are applying to Davis: greed. 
</P>
<P>
It seems instructive that the Dodgers have lived happily here ever after. 
</P>
<P>
For Davis, a principal financial problem is that the Coliseum lacks the sky-box 
revenue that many of his NFL competitors enjoy. Under league policies, sky-box 
revenue isn't shared by visiting teams, but it can be used by the home team for 
any purpose, including paying players. 
</P>
<P>
There is otherwise little basis in fact for the perception that Davis has set 
out avariciously to get his -- and get as much as he can -- at the expense of 
the people of Oakland or Los Angeles or both. 
</P>
<P>
The Davis book: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ten years ago in Oakland, stadium improvements he wanted would have cost 
the city about $6 million. Private parties had agreed to ante up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Before the deal could be implemented, Oakland's authorities changed their minds 
and invalidated the offer. According to the court's finding at the Raider-NFL 
trial, high-ranking NFL leaders advised Oakland to save its money because the 
league wouldn't permit a Raider move. 
</P>
<P>
The league discovered, however, that it couldn't block the move. And after the 
Raiders had gone south, Oakland, angling to get them back, found it necessary 
to raise its offer from $6 million to $600 million during heated bidding in the 
late 1980s against Sacramento and other California cities. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three years ago in Los Angeles, stadium improvements Davis wanted would 
have cost the Coliseum Commission well under the $29 million it won when it 
joined him in a major lawsuit against the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, the Coliseum could then have been modernized for free. 
</P>
<P>
Commission membership, however, changes periodically, and at that time a new 
group of Coliseum commissioners decided to use the money for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
They so decided although Davis, as promised, had contracted to build the 
Coliseum's sky boxes at Raider expense. He was, in fact, even financing a new 
press box -- for this site of two Olympic Games -- also at Raider expense, an 
out-of-pocket cost of $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, as a new decade starts, much of the local focus remains on Davis' 
inadequacies rather than the best interests of Los Angeles. It's a focus that 
places people here in double jeopardy: 
</P>
<P>
They're facing the loss of the only NFL team Los Angeles has -- at least in the 
heavily populated regions north of Orange County -- and they're facing a future 
without a renovated, world-class Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't make much sense.

MIKE DOWNEY: COWBOYS A HOUSE OF CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousand Oaks was like summer camp for consenting adults. As ex-assistant Paul 
Hackett said early in his first camp, "This place is incredible. Just about 
everybody's got something going out here." Landry's team was an irresistible 
sexual magnet. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the Dallas Cowboys going to do without their beach-blanket bimbo, San 
Fernando Valley-girl, let-the-games-begin summertime fun? 
</P>
<P>
This is just one of the many questions -- and insights and behind-the-scenes 
peeps -- that surface in the fascinating new nonfiction book, "God's Coach," by 
Dallas sports columnist Skip Bayless: the inside story of the rise and fall of 
a Texas-based sports-and-entertainment business that had the audacity to fancy 
itself America's Team. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first things Jerry Jones did after he purchased his favorite NFL 
team was inquire why that team was forking over a half-million dollars or more 
each year to train at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks after it spent 
an ungodly amount of money in Texas to build a spectacular new training 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"One reason, Jones discovered, was that so many front-office people and coaches 
had girlfriends in California," Bayless writes. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe a team can get away with losing money when it isn't losing games. But 
when the Cowboys began to bite the dust, along came Jones, who found himself 
wallowing up to his wallet in debt, thanks to team officials such as Tex 
Schramm and Gil Brandt, who apparently spent money faster than anybody this 
side of Leona Helmsley. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who bought the team only on the condition that he could bring old 
college chum Jimmy Johnson to coach, also had to endure accusations of his 
being guilty of the greatest betrayal since Judas from disciples of the titular 
figure of Bayless' book, Tom Landry. 
</P>
<P>
Firing Landry was tantamount to forgetting the Alamo or tugging the mask off 
the old Lone Ranger or spouting blasphemy. In the Lone Star State, Tom Landry 
was a virtual deity. 
</P>
<P>
"God's Coach" opens with Jones giving Landry the bad news, face to face, near 
the putting green of a golf course, with the coach's family in close-enough 
proximity that they immediately figured out, much to their horror, what was 
happening. What follows is something of a shocker: A claim that a large group 
of Cowboy players, upon hearing the news, immediately toasted one another in a 
bar while saying: "Here's to the bald-headed . . . He got it just the way he 
gave it to so many of us." 
</P>
<P>
Strong stuff, but that's what this particular book is here to supply. For years 
and years, we have heard story after story about the wonderful Cowpokes, about 
what a privilege it was to play for such a fine and upstanding organization, 
about the lessons other teams could learn from doing things the Dallas way. 
</P>
<P>
What we get instead is a story of massive ego-stroking and overspending, of 
emotional blackmail and contractual bickering, of unfeeling coaches who 
couldn't remember a player's name but took it very personally if that player 
wasn't prepared to make unreasonable sacrifices for the sake of the team. 
</P>
<P>
We learn, more or less, that former Cowboy player Pete Gent's "North Dallas 
Forty" was not so much a made-up story as it was a documentary. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, this tome is already proving to be both titillating and unsettling 
to those who care for the Cowboys and want never to have heard a discouraging 
word. Bayless shows America's Team, warts and all, and it isn't necessarily a 
pretty picture. Yet, he tells this story compellingly and candidly, not only 
through his eyes, but from the Cowboy horses' mouths. 
</P>
<P>
Bum Bright, the man who sold the Cowboys to Jones, acknowledges how it was he 
who first broached the idea of dismissing Landry as coach, only to discover 
that rather than award Landry three one-year contracts, as Bright instructed, 
his subordinates blithely gave Landry a three-year guaranteed deal. This meant 
Jones inherited a $1-million debt to Landry the minute he purchased the team. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was Schramm, the team president, whom Bright compared to the 
fabled circus promoter, P.T. Barnum, in the way Schramm sold the public on the 
mystique and majesty of the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
"He was like Phineas T. and Jumbo the elephant," Bright said. "Jumbo wasn't 
really the world's biggest elephant. Tex just convinced everybody it was." 
</P>
<P>
We read of the amorous adventures of many Cowboys, including former owner Clint 
Murchison, who couldn't seem to keep their boots on. Of the transition at 
quarterback from Dandy Don Meredith to the extremely serious and competitive 
Roger Staubach, whom Bayless refers to as the "unMeredith." Of the various 
tragedies that befell Hollywood Henderson, D.D. Lewis, Lance Rentzel and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas football club, we conclude, was a house of cards just waiting to 
collapse. Certainly nobody in the book comes across as particularly evil, but 
any portrayal of Tom Landry that does not nominate him for sainthood is bound 
to raise a commotion in Texas, as this book already is doing. 
</P>
<P>
We used to enjoy watching the Dallas Cowboys, back when they were always worth 
watching. This is the best look we have had at them in quite a while.

HORSE RACING BOARD ELECTS HUTCHESON AS TOP EXECUTIVE 
</P>

Dennis Hutcheson, assistant executive secretary of the California Horse Racing 
Board for more than two years, was elected executive secretary at a board 
meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-2 vote, racing commissioners named Hutcheson over 41 other candidates 
for the $74,500-a-year job, which became vacant in April when Len Foote retired 
after 22 years with the board. 
</P>
<P>
Phoebe Cooke and Rosemary Ferraro voted against Hutcheson's appointment, 
questioning his credentials and suggesting that someone not connected with the 
controversial Foote regime would have been a better choice. 
</P>
<P>
"Dennis left the state's finance department in early 1988 and came to the 
racing board with no racing experience," Cooke said. "He supposedly learned the 
job under Len Foote, but I don't think Foote was the best instructor. The board 
has been lacking in accountability because of some of the things Foote did." 
</P>
<P>
Foote has denied he was forced to leave. At the end of his term, six trainers 
-- including Wayne Lukas and Laz Barrera -- were accused of running horses that 
had been given cocaine, but the charges eventually were dropped. Barrera and 
Roger Stein, another of the accused trainers, have filed multimillion-dollar 
suits against the board. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not feel that Dennis was the most qualified person for this job," Cooke 
said. "He has not demonstrated the leadership to run a huge, very important 
agency." 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro, board chairman Henry Chavez and board member Paul Deats made up a 
screening committee that recommended Hutcheson. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't dislike Dennis, but I have to give him a 'no' vote," Ferraro said. 
"All of the problems the board has had in the last couple of years have led to 
the office that he worked in. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a fresh, new leader who can give some new spirit to the staff." 
</P>
<P>
Hutcheson, 40, said that before joining Foote's staff, one of his 
responsibilities for three years was the state's racing budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent a lot of time with horsemen, trying to learn the game, in the last 
couple of years," Hutcheson said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the comments by Cooke and Ferraro, Hutcheson said: "The board 
members are appointed because they are supposed to have their opinions. I've 
worked closely with the board, and I hope that will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some goals. I hope that this agency can develop into one of the best in 
the state. I'd like to return the confidence in this office to the board and 
the state. And I'd like to be consistent in the way we deal with horsemen." 
</P>
<P>
Hutcheson was nominated by board member John La Follette, and the motion was 
seconded by William Lansdale. They voted for Hutcheson, along with Chavez, 
Deats and Leslie Liscom. 
</P>
<P>
Hutcheson, who worked for 15 years in the state's finance department, grew up 
in Marysville and Long Beach. He majored in accounting and graduated from Cal 
State Sacramento.

MURRAY PROVIDES GOOD NEWS; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: HE STAYS HOT IN 8-1 VICTORY OVER BRAVES, BUT HAMILTON WILL NOT RETURN 
THIS SEASON AND HAS TO DECIDE WHETHER TO HAVE MORE SURGERY ON HIS SHOULDER. 
</P>

It was evident Thursday in the clanging balls off the outfield seats, the oohs 
of the fans, the slaps of the high-fives that suddenly reappeared in the home 
team's dugout. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are never so loud as when they are pulled along by Eddie Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Led by the first baseman who seemingly hasn't taken a bad swing in a week, the 
Dodgers defeated the Atlanta Braves, 8-1, before 31,461 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Murray extended his hitting streak to six games by showing all of his best 
stuff. He hit his 15th homer. He doubled. He fought off a fastball for a 
check-swing RBI single. And he drew a walk after falling behind 0-and-2. 
</P>
<P>
"When Eddie hits," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said, "we score runs." 
</P>
<P>
Murray's efforts, plus a homer by Kal Daniels and nine other Dodger hits, gave 
Tim Belcher his fourth win in five starts. And Belcher didn't even have to 
throw a one-hitter. He was removed after six innings, during which he allowed 
one run on three hits to improve his record to 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
The evening provided the Dodgers with some much-needed good news, because soon 
they will receive the disturbing news that injured Jeff Hamilton will not play 
again this season. 
</P>
<P>
Before Thursday's game, Hamilton said he has decided to either undergo a second 
shoulder surgery or rest the shoulder until next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger third baseman, who has been on the disabled list since April 21 and 
underwent arthroscopic surgery May 4, reached the decision after an exam 
Tuesday by Dr. Frank Jobe. Hamilton's shoulder has continually hurt since the 
surgery, such that he can't lift a suitcase or even swat at a bug without 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
Jobe recommended a month of complete rest, and then more extensive surgery if 
the shoulder did not improve. Such a surgery would require as much as six 
months of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said he does not like the idea of surgery on a problem that is still 
ambiguous, and he does not think that a month of rest will help. 
</P>
<P>
"So I offered my own option, of not doing anything until next year," said 
Hamilton, who has not taken batting practice for 10 days and is still in pain. 
"And I will do one or the other. Right now, I feel like taking the second 
option and avoiding surgery, but my mind changes every minute. Either way, I am 
done for the year." 
</P>
<P>
Jobe said Hamilton's problems could be caused by the location of the rotator 
cuff tear, which he discovered but did not fix during the first surgery because 
the tear was located in the substance of the tendon instead of tearing clear 
through the tendon. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually when it's in the substance like that, it will heal with rest and 
rehabilitation," Jobe said Thursday. "But with Jeff, it hasn't gone that well." 
</P>
<P>
Jobe said he did not think avoiding surgery would be a good choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's a viable option for this reason: If it doesn't heal over 
the winter, then he is lost for next year, too," Jobe said. "He has to think 
about his career." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton's absence has been softened by fine season from platoon replacements 
Lenny Harris and Mike Sharperson, who had three hits Thursday against 
right-handed pitching while making his first major league start at shortstop. 
Combined, Harris and Sharperson are hitting .308. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Dodger offense has played well in this home stand. Led by Murray, 
they have accounted for 30 runs on 46 hits in four games. 
</P>
<P>
During his six-game streak, during which the third-place Dodgers have won four 
games to pull to within 11 games of division-leading Cincinnati, Murray has 11 
hits in 23 at-bats for a .478 average. He has three homers and eight runs 
batted in and has scored eight runs. Overall, he has increased his average to 
.305 with a team-leading 51 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball has just been falling, that's all," Murray said. "A sign of how good 
you are going is how many different things are happening to your hits. To hit 
.300, you either have to be able to run, or you have to get some bleeders and 
bloopers and things like that. I just hope the balls keep falling." 
</P>
<P>
Also in impressive streaks are the two men who hit in front of Murray. Kirk 
Gibson, who doubled and scored a run Thursday, has hit in four consecutive 
games with a .378 average during that time. Daniels, who added a single to his 
15th homer, has an eight-game hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the three men have been playing in the same lineup with some 
consistency only since June 2, the Dodgers must wonder what an extra two months 
would have meant to their pennant chances. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is starting to feel comfortable together," Sharperson said. "That 
makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 1-1, in the sixth inning Thursday, Belcher made the 
Dodgers uncomfortable by walking Jim Presley and Dave Justice to start the 
inning. But then he struck out Tommy Gregg after Gregg fouled off eight pitches 
and retired Jeff Blauser on a foul to the catcher. After walking Greg Olson 
with the bases loaded, Belcher fooled pitcher Marty Clary into a groundout to 
end a 41-pitch inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was pitching a doubleheader out there," said Belcher, who was 
made a winner when Daniels led off the sixth with his tiebreaking home run. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
If his rehabilitation continues as scheduled, Orel Hershiser will be pitching 
batting practice before the end of the season. According to Dr. Frank Jobe, the 
Dodgers want Hershiser to enter the winter phase of his rehabilitation with 
some of his pitching rhythm. "Even if you get the shoulder strong and get a 
full range of motion, you still need to do a tremendous amount work on the 
rhythm of throwing because of the way that rhythm affects the shoulder," Jobe 
said. "Before the season ends, we would like for Orel to start working on that 
rhythm and mechanics." 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary hearing in the Pittsburgh City Court for infielders Alfredo 
Griffin and Juan Samuel on charges of simple assault has been postponed from 
July 31 to Aug. 27. The Dodgers are off that day, and play in Philadelphia the 
next day, so the players will be able to attend. Griffin, who is still 
suffering from a swollen eye and is scheduled for another examination today. 
Mike Sharperso had appeared in five games at shortstop in his 2 1/2-year 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bene, the Dodgers' first pick in the June, 1988 draft, fell to 1-9 for 
Class-A Vero Beach Wednesday by giving up five runs in one-third of an inning 
with five walks. . . . After a celebrated shave earlier this season, Rick 
Dempsey is growing his mustache back. . . . The California Egg Commission, 
which sponsors today's autographed ball giveaway, will be interested to see 
that the prominent autograph underneath their logo belongs to Willie Randolph, 
who has not been a Dodger since May 13.

BROWNOUT WAS A DOUBLE BLOW TO RAIDERS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: WITH TIM BROWN HEALTHY, THEY WILL BE STRONGER ON OFFENSE AND KICK 
RETURNS.

Tim Brown fields the punt, cuts to his left and takes off down the sideline, 
thrusting his hands into the air to celebrate as he crosses the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
After watching Brown accelerate on the practice field, you'd hardly know that 
he tore two ligaments in his left knee while returning a kickoff in the 
Raiders' 1989 season opener 10 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
As Brown lay on the field waiting to be carted off, his future flashed before 
his eyes. "I think the first night was the most difficult night for me," he 
said. "After that I said, 'Hey, I've got my degree from Notre Dame, and I know 
I can work. I'm not going to be making the kind of money I'm making out here 
playing football, but I know I'm going to be doing something.' I tried to take 
a positive outlook." 
</P>
<P>
But still there were doubts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Would the injury rob him of the speed that enabled him to win the Heisman 
Trophy in 1987? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Would he still be able to make the slashing moves that made him one of the 
NFL's kickoff- and punt-return leaders in 1988? 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I was really worried about was being able to cut," Brown said. 
"I can play this game a little bit slower, but not being able to cut was going 
to cause a big problem. But I started being able to make cuts in late January, 
and once I realized I could cut, my confidence started to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Brown injured his medial collateral ligament and the posterior cruciate 
ligament in his left knee. He ripped the medial collateral ligament off the 
bone. This is the ligament that allows the knee to perform split-second cuts. 
Actually, Brown may have been fortunate that he tore it from the bone, rather 
than snapped it, because doctors were able to reattach the ligament. 
</P>
<P>
After spending two weeks in a cast and four weeks in a brace, Brown began 
rehabilitation to rebuild his knee muscles. He pushed himself as hard in 
training as he works during games. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was going through it all, I was thinking that I wanted to be able to 
get back to the point where one day when I have kids, I can play with them," 
Brown said. "You never think you'll be able to get back on the field, but it's 
just amazing how time can heal all things. 
</P>
<P>
"My speed's not the same as what it was, but that's the only thing I think I'm 
missing -- my overall speed. But you hardly get a chance to show it out here on 
the field because everything's so fast. You hardly ever get to run the 40 or 50 
yards that will show your speed." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Coach Art Shell marvels at Brown's comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim looks good," Shell said. "You'd never know the guy was hurt. He's running 
like he never had an injury. He worked his butt off to get back to where he is 
now. It will be a big plus for our football team if he's healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Brown's teammates also are impressed by his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"For a guy that blew apart his knee last year, he's bounced back tremendously," 
Raider quarterback Jay Schroeder said. "I think a lot has to do with what he 
does in the off-season. He's very dedicated and he works hard. And I think it's 
proof because he's come out here and it doesn't look like he's missed a step. 
He's running right there along with everyone out here." 
</P>
<P>
The sixth player selected in the 1988 NFL draft, Brown's performance as a 
rookie justified the $2.7-million, four-year contract the Raiders gave him. 
</P>
<P>
After acquiring wide receiver Willie Gault from Chicago, there was speculation 
that the Raiders would trade Brown to the Washington Redskins for Schroeder, 
but they kept Brown. 
</P>
<P>
This was a wise move because Brown got off to an extraordinary start, returning 
his first kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown in the Raiders' 1988 opener against 
the San Diego Chargers. It was the fourth-longest kickoff return in team 
history and the first for a touchdown by a Raider since Derrick Jensen did it 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Brown averaged 26.8 yards to lead the NFL in kickoff returns on his way to the 
Pro Bowl. He also led the AFC in punt returns and was the leading Raider 
receiver with 43 catches. 
</P>
<P>
He broke Gale Sayers' NFL record for most total yards by a rookie with 2,317, 
compiling 1,098 yards on kickoff returns, 444 on punt returns, 725 on pass 
receptions and 50 on runs from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders clearly missed Brown's explosive returns last season. Stefon Adams, 
who returned kickoffs in place of Brown, ranked next to last in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
Although Brown will return punts this season, he may be finished with kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say I'm done with kickoff returns for good because I don't 
want something to whip me," Brown said. "So I'm going to go back and give it 
one more shot, but it probably won't be this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I still love (returning kickoffs). That's the most exciting part of the game 
-- to see a guy catch a kickoff and go the length of the field. I don't think 
you can ask any more than that." 
</P>
<P>
Although wide receiver Mervyn Fernandez did a nice job of filling in for Brown 
last season, catching 57 passes for 1,069 yards and nine touchdowns to lead the 
team, he was the Raiders' only intermediate pass receiver. 
</P>
<P>
With Brown back, the Raiders have another receiver capable of catching passes 
over the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"You always like to think that the team misses you," Brown said. "And I think 
there were situations last year where people said, 'Damn, I wish Tim was in on 
that play.' " 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder agreed, saying: "We missed Tim Brown a lot. He's a big factor in any 
football game, not only for his return capabilities, but because he's a 
big-play receiver. He's a guy that you can dump a two-yard route to who can 
turn it into 60 yards. There was no question that there were certain things we 
couldn't do last season because we didn't have Tim Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Brown came to training camp listed behind Fernandez on the Raider depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm approaching this year the same way as I approached my rookie year," Brown 
said. "I'm coming in as the second receiver behind Mervyn, and whatever they 
ask me to do, I'm going to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's probably a little pressure because you're not out there every down, 
and whenever you get out there you've got to show yourself. But I'm not out 
here to prove anything to Mr. (Al) Davis. Mr. Davis knows I can play football. 
I don't have anything to prove. Hey, I had a great rookie year. It would be 
different if I had played the whole year last year and fumbled every time I 
touched the ball, but that's not the situation. I don't have to prove anything 
to anyone but myself." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant coach Fred Biletnikoff, a Hall of Fame receiver, said Brown will 
improve the Raider passing game this season. 
</P>

"He looks absolutely great," Biletnikoff said. "He's got his speed and 
quickness back, and he's catching the ball really well. I think he's been a big 
surprise to everyone. He's made a remarkable comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"We missed him a lot last year. He would have been the difference for us in a 
lot of instances in two or three games." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders hope Brown will make a difference as they try to return to the NFL 
playoffs for the first time since 1985.

Cornerback Terry McDaniel suffered a strained hamstring in practice Thursday, 
but the injury isn't believed to be serious. . . . Tight end Mike Dyal, who 
held out for three days, signed a two-year contract for about $260,000 a 
season. . . . There were no developments in contract talks with the six 
unsigned players -- quarterback Steve Beuerlein, tailback Marcus Allen, 
fullback Steve Smith, cornerback Mike Haynes, safety Vann McElroy and defensive 
end Greg Townsend.

RAMS REDUCE THEIR HOLDOUT LIST BY TWO; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: WRIGHT, FARYNIARZ SIGN, BUT SEVEN OTHERS REMAIN OUT OF TRAINING 
CAMP. 
</P>

<P>
The Rams continued to chip away at their long slate of training camp no-shows, 
signing linebacker Brett Faryniarz and nose tackle Alvin Wright to contracts 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The terms were not immediately available, but Wright, the starting nose tackle 
who played for a base salary of $220,000 in 1989, signed a three-year deal for 
what is believed to be a substantial increase. 
</P>
<P>
The signings left the Rams with four unsigned veterans -- Kevin Greene, Damone 
Johnson, Doug Reed and Michael Stewart; two unsigned draft choices, first-round 
pick Bern Brostek and second-round selection Pat Terrell, and one unhappy 
player under contract but out of camp, Jackie Slater. 
</P>
<P>
Slater, a 14-year veteran, is seeking to renegotiate his contract of $550,000 
for 1990 and hadn't arrived as of Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Though Slater is much beloved in Ram circles, Coach John Robinson said he 
considers his holdout no different than others in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just business," Robinson said. "It goes on all the time. It has nothing 
to do with Jackie." 
</P>
<P>
One player closely watching Greene's ongoing contract negotiations is Pro Bowl 
cornerback-turned-safety Jerry Gray, who figures to use the linebacker's deal 
to shape his next contract. In fact, both players have the same agent. 
</P>
<P>
Gray signed a one-year contract for $500,000 for this season, not including 
some reachable incentives, and eagerly awaits the outcome of Greene's ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen what the Rams do to guys that come out and bitch," Gray said, 
rekindling memories of Eric Dickerson and Greg Bell. "Now we'll see if they 
have another side to them." 
</P>
<P>
Greene and Gray are two of the team's best-liked veterans. Both players made 
the Pro Bowl in 1989. Greene earned $225,000 in base salary for the season, 
Gray $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of staging a holdout of his own this summer, Gray took the stepladder 
approach, accepting a one-year contract for 1990 as he builds momentum for his 
next negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it (would have been) fair to (raise) me from $250,000 to $900,000 
or a million, I think it was too far of a jump," Gray said. "It's like being on 
the 10th floor and you want to get down. If you work your way down to the fifth 
floor, it doesn't seem that far." 
</P>
<P>
In monetary terms, consider how far Greene and Gray are lagging behind the rest 
of the league: New York Giant linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who had fewer sacks 
than Greene the last two years, is holding out of camp until the team 
renegotiates his $1.2-million deal for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, in turn, rattled off a list of defensive backs who are in a higher tax 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
"Joey Browner (Minnesota), he averages out to $900,000," Gray said. "You've got 
Ronnie Lott (San Francisco) at $825,000. Deron Cherry (Kansas City), all those 
guys are in at $800,000. Raymond Clayborn (Cleveland), he's in the $900,000s. 
Deion (Sanders) averages $1.1 million. If you're in that type of caliber, you 
want that type of money." 
</P>
<P>
Gray says Greene has long been a hard-working company man. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin's a real nice guy," Gray said. "He plays for the team. It's not a 
selfish thing with him, and everyone knows it. That's what's going to be so 
hard for the Rams, to say, 'We can do without him.' Because he's not the type 
they ever had to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Guard Tom Newberry reported to camp Thursday. He was granted a one-day leave to 
remain with his pregnant wife in Miami. . . . Some more numbers for holdout 
Kevin Greene to consider: On Thursday, New Orleans signed veteran Pro Bowl 
linebacker Rickey Jackson to a two-year contract worth $825,000 a season, with 
a $50,000 reporting bonus each year. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are believed to be offering first-round choice Bern Brostek the same 
four-year, $1.8-million deal they gave Cleveland Gary last season. Gary was the 
26th overall pick, Brostek the 23rd. . . . The Rams' chief contract negotiator, 
Jay Zygmunt, was in Chicago, where his father suffered a heart attack.

</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AS A KIND GESTURE, THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT GAME FOR THE 
U.S.S.R. IS HALTED AFTER 6 1/2 INNINGS.

<P>
It could have been worse. Everyone in the CCCP and USA baseball jerseys knew 
it, and so did the tournament planners, who decreed there would be a 10-run 
mercy rule once Thursday's game reached the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
These are, after all, the Games of Goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
So after 6 1/2 innings at Cheney Stadium, the Soviets ended their primer in 
that intriguing American exercise known as baseball. The final score was United 
States 17, Soviet Union 0. The Americans sent 29 batters to the plate in the 
first three innings. The Soviets clinked four singles, caught some fly balls, 
turned one double play and had no one seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"'In general," Soviet assistant coach Alexander Ardatov surmised, "the game 
turned out very well." 
</P>
<P>
All of three years old, the Soviet national baseball program toddled into its 
first major international competition fearing catastrophe. This was going to be 
worse than the United States in the World Cup. Or at least close. 
</P>
<P>
In Team U.S.S.R.'s media guide for the Goodwill Games, printed by Sovetsky 
Sports Publishers, it notes that "The Goodwill Games tournament opener makes 
the U.S.S.R. play against the Americans, (which lets) them have enough time to 
come to their senses after the game." 
</P>
<P>
Or as Soviet first baseman Ilya Onokhov put it, "We were very nervous that they 
will beat us by a very much score." 
</P>
<P>
The Americans won by a very much score. But Onokhov, grinding away at a plug of 
American chewing tobacco -- Red Man, of course -- was smiling. He had singled 
in his last at-bat, a towering blast over the head of U.S. shortstop Roger 
Burnett. 
</P>
<P>
That enabled Onokhov to bask in the light of another American baseball 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
So, what pitch did you hit? 
</P>
<P>
Onokhov's eyes widened. 
</P>
<P>
"Fast," he said. "But at the end of the bat. Not the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Onokhov said he would try to do better next time. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets are here, learning about cutoff men and pickoff throws, because of 
the 1987 announcement that baseball would be a medal sport in the 1992 
Olympics. Soviet sports officials knew nothing about the game, but they do know 
their medal counts, so they quickly commissioned a national baseball program. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes were recruited from other Olympic sports -- basically, the leftovers, 
the bit players. The Soviets' best pitcher, Alexander Buyanov, used to compete 
in the decathlon. Another pitcher, Gherman Gulbit, used to throw the javelin. 
Others came from team handball, rowing, wrestling, tennis and water polo. 
</P>
<P>
The head coach, Vladmir Bogatyrev, was once the Soviet Union's cycling coach. 
He saw his first baseball game eight years during a competition in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the game, I really liked and I got carried away with it," Bogatyrev 
said. With credentials like those, the Soviet national sports committee knew 
they had found their man. 
</P>
<P>
Bogatyrev's right hand man is consultant/interpreter/assistant coach Rick 
Spooner, a transplanted Philadelphia businessman living in Moscow. Spooner has 
helped build the Soviet program, literally, from the ground up. Three years 
ago, Soviets were introduced to the game on abandoned soccer fields. Six months 
ago, they added pitchers' mounds. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner remembers one of the early days, when he was umpiring behind the plate 
during a practice game. 
</P>
<P>
"A batter gets hit right in the back with a fastball," Spooner said, "and he 
turns around and asks, 'Richard, what does that mean?' 
</P>
<P>
"And I said, 'Boris, that means you go to first base.' " 
</P>
<P>
More difficult than the rules were the fundamentals. Such as throwing the 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Soviet Union, they don't have any sports where they throw a ball like 
that," Spooner said. "It came a little easier to the water polo and team 
handball players. And we do have a couple pitchers who were javelin throwers. 
Of course, that only goes so far when you're throwing a baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Hitting was entirely different, Spooner reported. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a couple tennis players who hit the ball pretty good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of what Spooner couldn't teach, the Soviets learned from TV. "They started 
chewing tobacco after watching a videotape of an American game," Spooner said. 
"And they started to follow favorite players." 
</P>
<P>
So who goes over big back in the U.S.S.R.? 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly, they like players with the best nicknames," Spooner said. "They like 
Dave Parker -- 'Cobra.' Andre Dawson -- 'Hawk.' Darryl Strawberry, because they 
thought his last name was a nickname." 
</P>
<P>
Only recently, however, Soviet factories began churning out bats and balls. A 
plant in Leningrad manufactures gloves, a company in Kiev stitches baseballs. 
"Other than that, it's been hook or by crook," Spooner said. "If any of the 
players have friends going abroad, they ask them to bring back gloves. They'll 
try to buy equipment off exchange students from Cuba and Puerto Rico." 
</P>
<P>
Even outfitting the team can be tricky. Thursday, most of the uniforms 
delivered to the Soviet Goodwill team were too small, so 20 players had to 
share 13 jerseys. No, the relief pitchers who warmed up in the bullpen with 
warm-up jackets on weren't confused about the concept. They were just waiting 
until an available number was sent to the showers. 
</P>
<P>
So, all things considered, 6 1/2 innings and 17-0 was a success. Three weeks 
ago, the Soviets played a group of American collegians in San Antonio, and the 
game was called at 13-2 -- in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
"My hope is for the young kids," Bogatyrev said. "The kids who watch are 
players now and decide to play baseball. That's our future. We will definitely 
need a generation to pass before baseball in the Soviet Union makes any big 
steps forward." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, then, that means a lot more very much scores.

The name that Ted Turner gave five years ago to his pseudo-Olympics, Goodwill 
Games, could not have been more appropriate than Thursday night in track and 
field competition at Husky Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 400-meter relay, an event traditionally dominated by the United 
States, it appeared as if Cuba might score a major upset. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba's anchor man, Joel Isai, had a two-meter lead when he received the baton 
and looked like an easy winner until he began to tighten up, enabling U.S. 
sprinter Dennis Mitchell to nip him at the tape. 
</P>
<P>
The four Cubans thought they won and, arm in arm, excitedly began a victory 
lap. 
</P>
<P>
Midway around the track, they stopped to watch the television replay on the 
scoreboard and realized that they finished second. Their time was 38.49, 
four-hundredths of a second behind the United States' 38.45. Those are the 
second and third fastest times in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
Having also seen the replay, the U.S. team began its victory lap. Isai waited 
for the Americans, and when they arrived, raised Mitchell's hand triumphantly 
and helped him wave a small American flag. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the spirit of good will, Soviet hammer throwers swept the medals but 
wished nothing but the best for their U.S. competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Said silver medalist Andrei Abduvalyev, "I wish the American hammer throwers 
would throw farther so we could come over and compete more." RANDY HARVEY

FOR THAT HAPPY TRAVELER SUNDAY SILENCE, GETTING THERE IS MORE THAN HALF THE FUN

No one is immune to the anxieties of air travel. Athletes, entertainers, 
business people -- everyone usually leaves an aircraft in worse shape than they 
get on, whether it's because of claustrophobia, long legs, bad chicken Kiev or 
a recent viewing of "Airport '75." 
</P>
<P>
Now, meet the guy who loves to fly: Horse of the year Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
The $10-million colt fairly runs up the van ramp when trainer Charlie 
Whittingham sends him out of town. He can hardly wait to be loaded onto one of 
Tex Sutton's 727s, bound for some kind of glory at a far-flung race track. Last 
year, Sunday Silence logged more miles than any horse of the year since All 
Along, who made a Paris-Toronto-New York grand circuit with a side trip to 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence's latest excursion finds him bedded down comfortably at 
Arlington International Racecourse in suburban Chicago, where he will run in 
the Arlington Challenge Cup on Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
With the retirement of Easy Goer, the Cup has been dropped from a 
million-dollar stake to a $600,000 race. And with the defection of Criminal 
Type, Sunday Silence needs an impressive victory to get his horse of the year 
title defense back on track, but so far the new surroundings haven't fazed him. 
He remains the same delightful delinquent he's been since day one, a cross 
between James Dean and Indiana Jones, with four legs, two Eclipse Awards and an 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence arrived in Chicago Monday morning with his familiar entourage -- 
Whittingham, groom Charles Clay and exercise rider Pam Mabes. He jogged 
Tuesday, galloped Wednesday and worked six furlongs Thursday morning in about 
1:12. So much for jet lag. 
</P>
<P>
"He's seems to know he's here for a serious purpose," Mabes said Thursday from 
her Arlington Heights hotel. "He struts to the track and struts back to the 
barn, letting everybody know just who he is." 
</P>
<P>
Despite traveling with Sunday Silence on the 1989 Triple Crown trail, to 
Louisiana for the Super Derby and to Miami for the Breeders' Cup, Mabes 
continues to be amazed at the ease with which her companion handles the hubbub. 
</P>
<P>
"Some horses just lose it," Mabes said. "Not Sunday. It's not stressful to him 
at all. If anything, flying seems to settle him down. He's a lot more relaxed 
than he is at the barn back home. His ears go up, he looks around, listens to 
everything. Really enjoys himself. 
</P>
<P>
"During the flight, he'll eat a little hay," Mabes added. "His eyelids will 
droop and he'll sleep a little bit. Who knows what's going on in that mind of 
his." 
</P>
<P>
Many times, a horse will require a tranquilizer to cope with air travel. Sunday 
Silence flies clean. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe in tranquilizing our horses for flying," said Whittingham's 
assistant trainer, Rodney Rash. "Charlie trains his horses to handle a flight 
just like anything else. They learn what they're supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, not all thoroughbreds have been so well prepared. Kathy Baird, 
who works for the Tex Sutton horse transport organization, cringes when certain 
horses are booked on a flight. 
</P>
<P>
"If a horse has been trained to be a good shipper, it doesn't matter if he's 
going by van or plane," Baird said. "They've been taught how to act, and they 
rarely give us trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Horses who are bad at the starting gate can have that carry over to when they 
ship. If they haven't learned how to be led in a straight line into a smaller 
space and then stand quietly, chances are they'll give us trouble loading and, 
maybe, shipping. You can tell which ones have learned their lessons." 
</P>
<P>
The Easy Goer spin doctors have been hard at work since the colt's ankle injury 
and retirement were announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Day, who rode Easy Goer in each of his 20 starts, told columnist Don 
Grisham in Thursday's Daily Racing Form: "I've said it before, I think Easy 
Goer was better than Sunday Silence, even though he beat us three out of four." 
</P>
<P>
New York Times racing reporter Steven Crist insisted that Easy Goer had 
"legitimate excuses" in two of his losses to Sunday Silence. He, too, conceded 
that Sunday Silence beat Easy Goer in three out of four meetings, " . . . but 
never in a way that proved he was just plain better." 
</P>
<P>
Sigh. Fans of both colts had better brace for more of this silliness. We've 
seen the same thing happen in the case of 1978 Triple Crown rivals Affirmed and 
Alydar. To some, the plain facts of Affirmed's clear dominance on the race 
track have been blurred by Alydar's superior record as a stallion. As retired 
racing secretary Jimmy Kilroe likes to say when confronted by such tortured 
logic, "That way lies madness." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, to continue defining Easy Goer's career in terms of Sunday Silence is 
blatantly unfair. Easy Goer was a remarkable racehorse, handsome beyond words, 
and the personification of grace in motion. Of the 51,065 registered 
thoroughbred foals of 1986, Easy Goer was lengths better than all of them . . . 
save one. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing unusual about the Easy Goer situation. In 1988, the U.S. 
Olympic men's basketball team was a powerful collection of brilliant stars. Yet 
it lost. These days, the most exciting, most popular golfer in the world is 
Greg Norman, yet he continues to lose major tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960 World Series, the New York Yankees fielded Mickey Mantle, Roger 
Maris, Whitey Ford, Yogi Berra and Bobby Richardson. Over seven games, they 
outscored the Pittsburgh Pirates, 55-27. And yet, the Pirates won the Series, 
four games to three. 
</P>
<P>
Being perceived as the best can be a terrible burden. Expectations can be 
unreasonably high. Given the choice, it may be safer to simply finish first -- 
as Sunday Silence usually did whenever he met Easy Goer. 
</P>

Horse Racing Notes

Trainer Ron McAnally said champion mare Bayakoa will run in the Aug. 4 San 
Diego Handicap at Del Mar against males. The 1 1/16-mile race should also 
attract Mervyn LeRoy Handicap winner Super May. . . . Got a beef with a call by 
the stewards lately? Relax. These people have been working without paychecks 
since early July. As state employees, race track stewards -- as well as 
investigators and clerical personnel -- have been caught up in the budget 
battle being waged between the governor and the legislature. They've got about 
a month's back salary coming . . . Santangelo, who keeps earning small pieces 
of big California stakes pots, worked six furlongs in 1:13 2/5 at Arlington 
Thursday in preparation for the Challenge Cup. . . . Nomination booklets are 
being distributed for the inaugural California Cup on Nov. 3 at Santa Anita.

Highland Talk, ridden by John Velasquez, took the lead entering the stretch and

Profit Key, the recent winner of the Dwyer Handicap in New York, drew the rail 
post position Thursday and was established the early favorite for the $500,000 
Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/8-mile, Grade I stake for 3-year-olds Saturday drew a field a seven 
colts. 
</P>
<P>
The main challenge to Profit Key should come from Rhythm, last year's 
2-year-old champion and the runner-up in the Dwyer. 
</P>
<P>
Profit Key, who was not nominated to the Triple Crown races, has been the more 
consistent of the horses. The 3-year-old son of Desert Wine has never finished 
worse than second in eight lifetime starts and has won five of six this year, 
with his only loss coming to Housebuster in the Withers at Belmont in May. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Jose Santos again will have the mount on the Wayne Lukas-trained runner. 
The colt was assigned 122 pounds and was made the 9-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm was assigned one pound less than Profit Key and again will have Craig 
Perret in the saddle. The Mr. Prospector colt drew the No. 5 post and the odds 
are 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the field in post position order: Secret Halo, Pat Day, 119, 3-1; 
Baron de Vaux, Jean Cruguet, 117, 12-1; Restless Con, Tim Doocy, 118, 6-1; 
Rhythm; Tees Prospect, Rick Wilson, 114, 20-1; and Yonder, Jerry Bailey, 118, 
10-1.

GENERAL ELECTRIC IS FINED $10 MILLION FOR DEFENSE FRAUD 
</P>

<P>
A federal judge fined General Electric Co. $10 million Thursday and sentenced 
two employees to prison for cheating the government on a contract for a 
battlefield computer system. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric, which pleaded guilty to another defense fraud five years ago, 
also announced that it had agreed to pay the government $8.3 million to settle 
a civil suit stemming from the scheme and $11.7 million to settle unrelated 
civil charges involving different defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The $10 million was the second-largest criminal fine in a defense contracting 
case, the government said. Northrop Corp. agreed to pay $17 million in February 
for falsifying records on parts for the cruise missile and Harrier jet. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a sad commentary on the corporate character of General Electric" at 
the time of the fraud, 1982 to 1984, said U.S. District Judge Lowell Reed Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Nicholas Harbist said GE had developed self-policing and 
disclosure safeguards to prevent similar fraud in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Their decade of deceit as government contractors has ended," Harbist said. 
</P>
<P>
GE is the nation's second-largest defense contractor, doing about $6 billion a 
year in business with the government. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1985, GE pleaded guilty to illegally claiming cost overruns on 
Minuteman missiles and paid a $1.04-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
The company was barred from defense contracting after the 1985 case, but the 
ban lasted only three weeks overall and just six months at the division where 
the violations occurred. 
</P>
<P>
An Army spokesman, Maj. Pete Keating, said Thursday that a decision had not 
been made on whether the company would be banned again. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we can make that determination, we would have to review the sentencing, 
the settlement agreement, plus matters that General Electric would present for 
consideration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two employees of the GE subsidiary involved in the fraud, Management &amp; 
Technical Services Co., received prison sentences but remained free on appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald A. Leo, 52, of King of Prussia, Pa., was sentenced to 10 months in 
prison and fined $15,000. Leo, the former materials manager at the subsidiary, 
was convicted of four counts of mail fraud and one count of trying to deceive 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
James Badolato, 43, of Springfield, was convicted of one count of obstructing 
justice and one count of trying to deceive investigators. He was sentenced to 
five months in prison and fined $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said both men have not accepted responsibility for their actions. He 
said Badolato had a "corporate mentality" that he felt "shields him somehow 
from responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
"They cannot make the claim that they are merely acting on behalf of the 
company," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Leo's wife, Mary, sobbed as her husband was sentenced, then called out, "He 
never did anything!" She left the courtroom at the judge's suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose from a $246-million contract to make a computer system to 
monitor supplies in the field. GE and Leo were convicted of not telling the 
Defense Department when they found subcontractors to make parts at significant 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
Badolato was convicted of misleading investigators and submitting false 
documents in a cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not a one-shot deal," Harbist told the judge. "This was a protracted 
and calculated effort to steal from the Department of Defense." 
</P>
<P>
He said the men were in a "corporate cocoon," feeling "insulated and not 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Both men and the company were convicted in February. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates from both sides of how much money the government lost ranged from 
$2.5 million to $8 million.

The company said it would open a new store -- its largest outside of its 
flagship New York location -- on Oct. 23 at the Two Rodeo Drive shopping center 
at Wilshire Boulevard and Rodeo Drive. Tiffany has operated a store in Beverly 
Hills since 1965. It moved into its current location at the elegant Regent 
Beverly Wilshire Hotel in 1967, and will close that location when it opens the

SUIT ACCUSES CAPITOL RECORDS OF TRYING TO FALSIFY DATA; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: AN EX-EMPLOYEE SAYS THE FIRM ORDERED HIM TO BRIBE RETAILERS TO 
HELP MOVE ITS ALBUMS UP BILLBOARD MAGAZINE'S SALES CHART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former manager for Capitol Records has sued the label, claiming that he was 
wrongfully fired for refusing to go along with a scheme that allegedly required 
him to bribe record retailers to submit false data for Billboard magazine's 
album sales chart. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations draw attention to the way the influential Billboard record 
charts are compiled and come amid new indications that the Justice Department 
is continuing a long-rumored probe into music industry influence over sales 
data that Billboard uses to rank the nation's 100 best-selling albums. 
</P>
<P>
In his 15-page lawsuit, filed last week in Los Angeles Superior Court, former 
Capitol Records special accounts manager Donald Newkirk alleged that Capitol 
and three other defendants tried to boost the chart position of the label's 
albums by instituting a scheme called "Billboard priority calling." The lawsuit 
alleges that as part of the scheme, Newkirk "was required to offer bribes to 
retailers in payment for their (making) false sales reports." Newkirk is 
seeking unspecified money damages in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman said Capitol Records has a policy of not commenting publicly "on 
any pending litigation with former employees." 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles lawyer familiar with Newkirk's claims as well as a source close 
to the Justice Department, however, say federal law enforcement officials have 
been looking into allegations that record companies have used gifts and money 
to bribe retailers to help boost an album's chart position. 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department spokesman in Washington refused to comment. And major 
record retailers reached Thursday said they hadn't received any Justice 
Department inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
Billboard recently revised the way it compiles its charts. The magazine said it 
did so to give "a more accurate picture of consumer purchases." 
</P>
<P>
Billboard's ranking of the top 100 pop music albums, based on weekly reports 
from about 200 record retailers around the nation, is consulted by thousands of 
radio station and record store officials and can affect an album's retail sales 
and radio station airplay by showing whether an album is gaining or losing 
sales momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many surveys reporting sensitive sales data, the names of Billboard's 
reporting record retailers are not confidential and are widely known in the 
industry. They include such leading chains as Los Angeles-based Music Plus, 
Minneapolis-based Musicland and Sacramento-based Tower Records as well as 
dozens of mom-and-pop record stores. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials of Music Plus and Musicland, the nation's largest record 
retailer, said that since they compile sales data by computer, it is nearly 
impossible to influence their reporting of sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no human element involved," said Shelly Tucker, director of purchasing 
at Music Plus' parent company, Show Industries. "All we do is take it direct 
from the computer and fax it to Billboard." 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Mayfield, the head of Billboard's chart operations, said he had no 
knowledge of any wrongdoing by Capitol but added that he has heard of instances 
of labels attempting to improve the chart positions of their artists' albums, 
particularly with smaller retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are quite aware of the fact that record companies try to get an edge," 
Mayfield said. "A company might attempt to alter figures or influence a 
(retail) account to change their report to us." 
</P>
<P>
Mayfield said he has heard of record companies offering free concert tickets 
and additional advertising spending in exchange for retailers changing their 
sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Billboard completed what it called "the most extensive retail panel 
revisions in the history of its charts." The changes were made to give more 
weight to large record store chains that track album sales electronically and 
give less weight to smaller retailers that monitor sales manually. 
</P>
<P>
Mayfield said the changes make it difficult, if not impossible, to influence 
Billboard's charts today.

BURBANK FIRM OFFERS CLOTHES FOR THE DISABLED; 
</P>
<P>
APPAREL: THE FOUNDERS BUY OFF-THE-RACK PRODUCTS IN OTHER STORES, THEN ALTER 
THEM. THE IDEA IS TO LET THE CUSTOMERS DRESS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

<P>
The most frustrating part of Tom Pirruccello's old job was shopping for 
clothing for the developmentally disabled people at the residential facility 
where he used to work. 
</P>
<P>
Trips to the department store were ordeals because of difficulties in 
transporting and fitting clothing for Pirruccello's clients, many of whom were 
in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
But out of that frustration came the idea for a company that is now two years 
old and will log sales of $350,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
Pirruccello and Kurt Rieback, the young founders of Professional Fit Clothing 
in Burbank, have built a thriving business by buying off-the-rack clothes and 
altering them to fit disabled customers. They choose clothes for their style 
and durability, but the primary purpose is to help the disabled dress like 
everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"People think disabled people should wear plaids and polyesters," said Susan 
Hart, administrator of Jackson Place, a residential facility for 104 disabled 
adults in Santa Ana. "Our clients have a pretty tough life as it is, without 
their clothes looking odd or unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Dressing properly may also become more important because of the passage of the 
Americans With Disabilities Act, which was signed into law Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The law, heralded as a major victory by disabled rights activists, is aimed at 
requiring and encouraging business owners to hire more disabled employees. This 
means that handicapped people now working in sheltered workshop situations, or 
in menial jobs, may soon be out applying for more mainstream positions, 
according to administrators who run the group homes and centers that care for 
the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators said they welcome Professional Fit's personalized shopping 
services because taking even one wheelchair-bound person to visit a local 
shopping mall can be exhausting and time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to fitting properly, the clothes boost morale for both the clients 
and staff members who take their charges into the community to work and play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an incredible service -- I'm really pleased with it," said Dave Kittleson 
of the United Cerebral Palsy/Spastic Children's Foundation center in 
Chatsworth. "They could become leaders in the field." 
</P>
<P>
Kittleson, who recently ordered 72 bathing suits from Professional Fit, said 
most of his clients have money to spend, because they receive about $80 a month 
in government aid to buy personal items, including clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Professional Fit's clothing prices are comparable to those of a department 
store. For example, a pair of pants sells for $22, with a $2.50 charge for 
alterations. 
</P>
<P>
What sets the company apart is the idea that came to Pirruccello, 27, when he 
was an assistant administrator in a residential facility for the disabled in 
Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
He thought that other administrators would welcome the shopping service because 
one of his most onerous tasks was buying and keeping track of his clients' 
clothes. "It was so difficult to take them out shopping," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About two years ago, while he was driving on the freeway, Pirruccello spotted 
Rieback, an old friend from high school. He signaled Rieback to call him so 
they could catch up. At the time, Rieback, 26, was working in the downtown 
California Mart, selling three women's swimwear lines. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave up a real lucrative job for this, but I knew it would be rewarding," 
said Rieback, who with his wife, Sandra, handles the buying and fashion 
selection for Professional Fit. 
</P>
<P>
Rieback said he knew that the business would take off when the first 
administrator they met with gave them an $8,500 order on the spot. That first 
order spawned a business that now grosses about $350,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
But their small business poses definite challenges. Sometimes Rieback and 
Pirruccello must measure clients who are violent, incoherent or severely 
crippled. "Some people hit me or try to pull my hair," said Pirruccello. Other 
clients tear or chew their clothes and must be dressed in extremely durable 
fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we have to find appropriate clothes for a 60-year-old man who wears 
a boy's Size 10," said Pirruccello. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulty in dealing with some clients, the pair personally tries 
to measure every person in a residential facility. Then, with everyone's 
measurements on file, administrators and staff members can easily order new 
clothing over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
To make dressing easy, they seek out pants with elastic or drawstring waists, 
zippers near the ankles and pull-on shirts and sweaters with roomy necklines. 
But they can also take a regular sports shirt with buttons and make it easy to 
put on by sewing a Velcro strip behind the button placket.

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO REIMPOSE CABLE CONTROLS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: A CONTROVERSIAL AMENDMENT TO ALLOW TELEPHONE COMPANIES INTO THE 
INDUSTRY FAILS, HOWEVER.

<P>
In a major step toward re-regulating cable television, a House committee 
Thursday unanimously approved legislation to control the industry, after 
removing a controversial amendment that would have allowed phone companies into 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
Similar legislation is already before the full Senate, and both chambers may 
vote as early as next week, with approval expected. The Bush Administration has 
expressed staunch opposition to regulating cable, but it is unclear whether it 
will risk during an election year a veto of a bill designed to answer consumer 
complaints about high cable prices and poor service. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to reimpose some regulatory control over the cable industry, which 
Congress freed of all regulation in 1984, has taken on rare political velocity. 
Congressmen have found that few issues seem to compel citizen response, 
particularly in certain rural areas, as quickly as the variety of choices and 
service on the American family's TV set. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was reported out of the Energy and Commerce Committee, also 
seemed to get a boost Thursday from the Federal Communications Commission, 
which issued a long-awaited report on the effects of six years of deregulation 
in the cable industry. While the FCC cautioned that it thought competition, not 
re-regulation, was the answer to problems in cable in the long run, it deferred 
to Congress on short-term regulatory measures of the sort contained in the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"Some cable operators have betrayed the trust placed in them by the Congress," 
said Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), one of the bill's principal sponsors. This 
measure would "rein in these sorts of renegades," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation's approval in committee became assured, and its ultimate 
passage greatly enhanced, when proponents of the most controversial element in 
the cable question admitted Thursday that they lacked the votes they needed to 
amend the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Frederick Boucher (D-Va.) had proposed an amendment to allow telephone 
companies into the cable television business, a way of encouraging competition. 
Proponents argued that allowing them in would speed the development of 
fiber-optic telecommunications networks that could carry voice, data and video 
in one wire. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have argued that the phone companies are so big and would enjoy such 
competitive advantages that they would quickly monopolize the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Support for the phone company amendment is so weak that Boucher also promised 
not to introduce it when the legislation comes before the House. However, he 
vowed to introduce the bill again next year, contending that it is the best 
hope for competition in the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
A similar phone company bill is expected to go before the Senate Commerce 
Committee next week, but its failure in the House weakens its chances. 
</P>
<P>
National Cable Television Assn. lobbyist James Mooney complained that "the bill 
goes too far," although he is not actively opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Assn. of Broadcasters, said he was 
"very pleased" that the telephone entry was defeated. He called the bill "real 
relief from abusive cable practices." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the House bill is "modest" regulation, said W. J. (Billy) Tauzin 
(D-La.). 
</P>
<P>
But "it is the best we can do . . . substantively and politically" this year, 
said Matthew J. Rinaldo (D-N.J.). It is "a pragmatic approach that will solve 
the problems that consumers have thrown in our lap." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the House bill orders: 
</P>
<P>
* The FCC to set rates for a "basic tier" of service for over-the-air stations, 
plus public TV and government channels. 
</P>
<P>
* State or local authorities to appeal to the FCC if they think rates in their 
areas "unreasonable or abusive" for premium programming. This provision also 
would apply to existing rates, meaning that current cable prices could be 
rolled back. 
</P>
<P>
* Cable programmers to provide their signals to back-yard satellite-dish owners 
at fair rates and to require cable systems to carry public and commercial 
stations, mainly on their existing channel assignments. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, however, continues to allow cable operators to sign "exclusive 
contracts" with programmers, forbidding them from selling their programming to 
potential rivals, as long as it does not "significantly impede competition." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate version has weaker language on what kinds of rates could be rolled 
back, but does not protect the so-called exclusivity clauses that cable 
programmers want.

GREAT AMERICAN, COAST SAVINGS REPORT LOSSES; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE RED INK IS BLAMED ON THE DECLINING REAL ESTATE MARKETS IN 
CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two of California's largest savings and loan firms, Great American Bank and 
Coast Savings Financial, reported steep losses Thursday, providing further 
evidence of softening real estate markets in California and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Great American reported a $107.9-million second-quarter loss. 
The thrift had indicated last week, when it announced an agreement to sell its 
130-office California branch network to Wells Fargo &amp; Co., that it 
anticipated a loss in excess of $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The loss, which brought Great American to the very brink of insolvency, was 
caused mainly by additions to reserves totaling $136 million to cover probable 
loan and foreclosure losses and a $40-million loss on real estate operations. 
The loss compares to a $10-million loss for 1989's second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's tangible capital -- one measure of its financial strength -- 
is now a scant $32 million, or 0.21% of its $15.4 billion in assets. Great 
American's capital is thus $195 million short of the minimum $227 million, or 
1.5% of assets, required by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the $492 million that Great American would receive from Wells Fargo for 
the California branches if the deal goes through, many analysts are skeptical 
that Great American can survive. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most ominous sign for Great American is the sharp rise in its 
nonperforming assets -- loans that are 90 days or more delinquent or in 
foreclosure. They rose to $699.9 million, or 4.48% of assets, up from $556.7 
million, or 3.61% of total assets, as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
A high percentage of nonperforming assets greatly impairs an S&amp;L's earnings 
power. That earnings drag was reflected in the decline in Great American's net 
interest income before loss provisions to $53.1 million for the second quarter, 
down from $59.6 million for the same three months last year. 
</P>
<P>
A broader measure of Great American's problem loans, called net classified 
assets, jumped to $1.8 billion. That's nearly double the $929.2 million in net 
classified assets as of March 31. Classified assets are those that management 
thinks are likely to produce losses at some point in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Great American attributed the jump in classified assets to a slowdown in 
"certain California real estate markets" and to tougher standards overall for 
determining problem loans. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Los Angeles-based Coast Savings Financial, parent of Coast Savings 
Bank, reported a $28.7-million loss for the second quarter, mostly because of 
problems with loans on apartments and office buildings in Colorado, Texas and 
New England. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Coast Chief Executive Ray Martin said many of the problem 
loans were made in the 1970s before the economies in those areas softened. He 
said that Coast stopped making commercial real estate loans in 1987 and that 
the thrift's home loans in California, the bulk of its business, are performing 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Coast set aside $31.5 million for losses it may suffer on problem loans and 
another $16.5 million for losses on foreclosed real estate. Desite the losses, 
Coast still meets all he government's necessary requirements for capital, the 
financial safety net a thrift must maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Also, First Nationwide Financial Corp. said it earned $41.3 million in the 
second quarter, compared to only $3.5 million a year earlier. The San 
Francisco-based unit of Ford Motor Co. attributed the gain to a higher margin 
between what it earns in interest and what it pays out to depositors. It also 
cited efforts to lower operating costs. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
CALIFORNIA THRIFTS' REAL ESTATE WOES 
</P>
<P>
CalFed 
</P>
<P>
* Second-quarter loss of $53 million, its first quarterly loss in eight years, 
due to $78.3 million added to loan-loss reserves and $13.4 million in real 
estate losses. Declining real estate values and an oversupply of commercial 
real estate in California, Arizona and the Southeast were blamed. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Federal 
</P>
<P>
* Second-quarter loss of $28.7 million stemming from problems with commercial 
real estate loans outside California. 
</P>
<P>
Great American 
</P>
<P>
* Second-quarter loss of $107.9 million. Wells Fargo purchasing Great 
American's 130 California branches. Burdened with commercial real estate, 
apartment and land loans in Arizona's depressed real estate market, Great 
American was forced to sell assets to raise capital to meet regulatory 
requirements on reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western 
</P>
<P>
* Securities and Exchange Commission conducting an "informal inquiry" involving 
real estate loan problems that caused a $77.3-million loss in the fourth 
quarter of 1989. Moody's lowered its credit ratings, expressing concern about 
adequate reserves to cover potential losses on commercial real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed Bank 
</P>
<P>
* Second-quarter loss of $108 million due to problems with commercial real 
estate loans. A sharp increase in foreclosures and delinquent loans during May 
brought the thrift's bad loans to $579 million, or 3.12% of its assets. Most of 
the increase in bad loans were attributed to $54 million in delinquent loans 
from a Northern California real estate developer.

<P>
The nation's top two auto makers, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., 
reported sharply lower second-quarter earnings Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
* GM's quarterly profit fell 38% from the year-ago period to $900.1 million as 
costly incentives were put into effect to draw buyers into showrooms. Revenue 
edged up to $33.9 billion from $33.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first six months of the year, GM said its earnings fell 46.7% to 
$1.6 billion on revenue of $64 billion, a 4.2% decline. 
</P>
<P>
* At Ford, the nation's No. 2 car maker, earnings for the same period plummeted 
45% to $770.7 million. Revenue was $26.9 billion, an increase of $982 million 
from the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half, Ford's earnings fell 56.7% to $1.2 billion as revenue fell 
2.5% to $50.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the auto makers struggled with a 6.3% drop in sales from 
a year ago despite costly incentives. A slump in usually robust overseas 
operations further reduced income. 
</P>
<P>
Ford expressed some optimism: "We believe our (market) share will improve with 
full availability of our new 1991 products," Ford Chairman Harold A. Poling and 
President Philip E. Benton said in a statement. During the first half of the 
year, Ford's share of the U.S. car market was 21.3%, down one point from its 
share for all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But GM managed to pick up market share in the quarter, and was the only U.S. 
car maker to do so. It noted that it held 36.5% of the U.S. passenger car 
market and 34.4% of trucks. Both were above the prior year's level, GM said, 
although it did not give the previous figures. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies said their second-quarter earnings were dented by economic 
problems in Brazil, where inflation was running at an annual rate of more than 
1,000% until the government put the brakes on the economy earlier this year 
with such moves as a currency freeze. 
</P>
<P>
Both sets of earnings were in line with what Wall Street analysts estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of New York said GM's and 
Ford's automotive earnings were actually a shade better than he had expected in 
light of Brazil's troubles and increased tax payments. 
</P>
<P>
"The earnings are much better than they look," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ford and GM each have large operations in Brazil -- GM its own and Ford with 
West German auto maker Volkswagen AG in the Autolatina joint project. 
</P>
<P>
"The culprit continues to be incentives," said Wertheim Schroder analyst John 
Casesa. He said incentives, which are used to lure customers into dealer 
showrooms, are averaging about $1,000 a car. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Corp. is expected to announce second-quarter profits Tuesday. Analysts 
expect net income to be about half the $341 million the company earned during 
the period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ford said lingering effects of strikes in Britain and Belgium contributed to 
sharply lower European earnings, longtime strengths for the company. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, Ford had labor problems in the United Kingdom in the first quarter 
and in Belgium in the second.

Martin Marietta Corp. said it won a $138-million U.S. Postal Service contract 
to produce 614 automated sorting machines. 
</P>
<P>
The machine was developed jointly by Martin Marietta Information Systems Group 
and National Presort Inc. of Dallas. NPI designs and develops automated 
mail-processing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Marietta Information Systems Group will produce the machines at its new 
manufacturing facility in Albuquerque, N.M. First delivery will be in late

</P>
<P>
Martin Marietta said this is the its second production contract for 
mail-sorting machines. In October 1989, it won a U.S. Postal Service contract 
to produce 267 sorting machines for flat mail. That $51-million contract also 
included an option for 200 additional flat sorting machines.

<P>
A West Los Angeles orthopedic surgeon recently charged with raping three female 
patients was charged Thursday with three counts of sexual battery against two 
other women, authorities said. The new misdemeanor charges against Dr. Yahya 
Lavi, 52, were filed in Los Angeles Municipal Court, according to Deputy Dist. 
Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Lydia Bodin. Lavi remains free on $500,000 bail after his arrest July 12 on 
charges of raping and sexually assaulting the three patients. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Lavi faces two felony counts each of rape by use of drugs, sexual 
battery and penetration by a foreign object; three counts of forcible rape, and 
one count of forcible oral copulation. He also faces five misdemeanor sexual 
battery counts. A hearing on the matter, postponed Thursday, was rescheduled 
for Sept. 12.

BILL BOYARSKY: REDRAWING DISTRICTS IN PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ask politicians why they conduct so much business in private and they react as 
if it's a dumb question. 
</P>
<P>
Some matters, they reply, are just too important to be left to the public. Take 
employee discipline. You don't want the public to know the details of the fire 
chief's foul-ups, they say. And what about lawsuits? You can't have some irate 
citizen messing up your legal strategy with uninformed debate. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has turned frequently to the 
lawsuit excuse, employing it to exclude the public and convene in private as 
they charted new boundaries for the five supervisorial districts. You may have 
read how my colleague, Richard Simon, was handcuffed by a sheriff's deputy when 
he had the nerve to venture into a public hallway, which had been declared 
off-limits to the press, and ask a supervisor a question. 
</P>
<P>
I know this will surprise the supervisors, but you don't have to act as if you 
were conspiring to commit a crime when you are passing laws. The process works 
when it's done in public. 
</P>
<P>
I rediscovered this rather fundamental concept Wednesday night in Pomona, which 
sits at the far eastern end of Los Angeles County. There, City Council members, 
like the county supervisors, are drawing new political boundaries. But these 
lawmakers are inviting the public to take part, soliciting their views in 
hearings held around the city this week. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearings, residents are shown two redistricting plans prepared for the 
city by a consultant, Alan Heslop of Claremont-McKenna College's Rose 
Institute. Members of the audience praise and criticize the plans and offer 
changes. After the hearings, the council, in open session, will vote on a final 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure the county supervisors' method is more efficient. There are drawbacks 
to popular participation. For one thing, people shout at each other. The pace 
drags. In Pomona, it really bogs down because an interpreter is required for 
audiences divided between English and Spanish-speaking residents. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, at a hearing at the Washington Park recreation center, an 
angry speaker stuck his finger in the face of the interpreter. "Get your finger 
out of my face," the interpreter said. His friends in the audience, a 
substantial number of people, stood up as a sign of support -- and warning. A 
security man had to ask for order. Toward the end, a city official joked to me, 
"Don't you think we ought to do this behind closed doors, like the 
supervisors?" 
</P>
<P>
But the two plans were explained in detail, and a few people voiced their 
opinions. Finally, at about 9:15 p.m., more than two hours after the meeting 
started, the audience, having had their fill, left without waiting for formal 
adjournment. These are people with minds of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona resident Maureen Brians, pausing to chat in the parking lot before 
driving home, said she thought the experience, however inefficient, had been 
worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
I'd picked a good person to interview. "I've lived in Pomona for 50 years," she 
said. A half-century -- it just about spans the slow decline in Pomona's 
fortunes that the city now is attempting to stop. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Pomona suffers from the ailments of poverty -- crime, gangs, and large 
number of teen-age mothers, and households headed only by mothers. 
</P>
<P>
It also faces some political tension. Though Pomona has the highest minority 
population in the region, until recently there were no minority members on its 
City Council. Now there are two Latinos. The purpose of the redistricting 
exercise is to draw voter districts that will ensure that the growing Latino 
and substantial black population will be represented. 
</P>
<P>
Brians came to the meeting to participate in this political and social change. 
"We want to do what's right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For Oneal McDaniels, an RTD supervisor who has lived in Pomona for 17 years, 
the right thing is to elect a black to the City Council. "We've been trying," 
he said, "to get a black on the City Council for eight or nine years." 
</P>
<P>
I'm not naive enough to think that this people-power redistricting is going to 
change the face of Pomona. The city's got too many problems for that. And I 
don't need to be reminded that the county is much bigger, more complex and more 
populous than Pomona. But the city officials' willingness to listen, even 
subject themselves to abuse, shows that they know the importance of making 
citizens part of the problem-solving process. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Brians, with her sense of the city's history, has something important 
to contribute. So does Oneal McDaniels, raising his family and watching his 
cheerleader daughter, Latasha, 17, prepare for UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen participation is not a new idea. We call it democracy. Perhaps the 
supervisors should discuss it the next time they meet behind closed doors.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRUSTACEANS FORCE CLOSURE OF RESERVOIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Small crustaceans have made their way into the drinking water supply of a 
neighborhood southwest of downtown, prompting the closure Thursday of Rowena 
Reservoir in Silver Lake for at least a month, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in eight days that the Department of Water and Power has 
been forced to temporarily close a reservoir in the same area because of an 
infestation believed to have been triggered by a prolonged hot spell this 
summer and the proliferation of algae, DWP spokeswoman Debra Sass said. 
</P>
<P>
On July 16, the agency closed the 77-acre Silver Lake Reservoir after residents 
in the 2900 block of Van Buren Place reported tiny brown wormlike midge fly 
larvae in their drinking water, Sass said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the DWP closed the 5.7-acre Rowena Reservoir after 
translucent-yellow aquatic amphipods measuring slightly larger than a half-inch 
were discovered in the water supply for the same neighborhood.

5 HELD IN SAN GABRIEL VALLEY ROBBERIES; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: AUTHORITIES ARRESTED 18 SUSPECTED 'BLACK DRAGON' GANG MEMBERS. BUT 13 
WERE RELEASED FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE IN MORE THAN 30 CRIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Authorities on Thursday announced that they had taken into custody 18 suspected 
members of the "Black Dragon" gang, a loosely knit group of mostly young 
Southeast Asian refugees who are thought to be responsible for more than 30 
armed robberies in the immigrant communities of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Because many of their alleged victims have been reluctant to come forward, 
however, 13 of the suspects were released for lack of evidence shortly after 
their arrest Tuesday by a task force made up of officers from seven Los Angeles 
County law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block, whose department heads the North Regional Surveillance 
and Apprehension Team, asked for the Asian community's help in identifying the 
suspects and tying them to more crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Black Dragon's "whole existence is based upon a very real understanding of the 
Asian culture, which is to accept victimization and keep quiet," Block said. 
"We need those victims to come forward." 
</P>
<P>
Of the five suspects who were not released, four were charged with robbery and 
kidnaping in connection with a heist Tuesday at The Beauty of Paris Salon in 
San Gabriel, officers said. They are Thuan Kso Ngo, 29, Anthony Lenh, 19, Ty 
Pham, 22, and Vang Tram. The fifth suspect, Hong Ly, 21, was charged with armed 
robbery in connection with a Los Angeles holdup. 
</P>
<P>
Block said the other 13 were arrested at what he called the gang's "crash pad" 
in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the Black Dragon is made up of about 40 youths, most of whom 
are the children of poor refugee families from Vietnam. They have been 
operating here since the mid-1980s and are suspected of contributing to the 
sharp increase of residential robberies in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike burglaries, in which thieves break in while a home is empty, a 
residential robbery depends on the occupants being there to show where 
valuables are kept, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Block said the gang succeeds because the victims are often fearful of 
retaliation, unfamiliar with the U.S. legal system or may not be documented 
residents of this country. He said officers were not interested in the victims' 
background, but are seeking help in solving the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Asian victim is least likely to come forward and report their 
victimization," Block said. "That's that kind of thing we're trying to break 
through."

MAYOR TELLS OF NEW PLAN FOR REVIEWS OF PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley unveiled a plan Thursday to alter Los Angeles' controversial 
environmental review system that allows developers to hire their own 
consultants to assess the impacts of their projects. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners and slow-growth advocates have called for reforms of the existing 
system. But the mayor's plan did not satisfy some of them. "This isn't reform, 
it's just change," said Barbara Fine, vice president of the Federation of 
Hillside and Canyon Assn., representing 50 homeowner groups. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's plan offers two options to the developer. Under the first option, the 
developer would be offered a guarantee that his environmental impact report 
would be completed and processed by the city in one year if he allowed the city 
to pick the consultant. This option would give the city the greatest control 
over the preparation of the report. 
</P>
<P>
The second option would maintain the status quo. The developer would pick his 
own consultant and "take his chances" on how quick the city would process the 
environmental review, said Brad Crowe, the Planning Department official who 
drafted the proposal. The city also would make available to the developer a 
list of "approved" consultants from which to choose -- but using the list would 
not be required. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Bradley said his program would help bring a new 
impartiality to the environmental review process which, he said, is now 
dominated by the "handpicked consultants" hired to represent the "selfish 
interests" of their developer clients. 
</P>
<P>
Under the mayor's plan, which was endorsed by several homeowner representatives 
and Councilman Marvin Braude, the city will have the "most progressive and 
objective EIR process in the country," said Bradley press secretary Bill 
Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
Fine, the homeowner leader, said the city should not offer the developer 
options. Rather, the city should simply require that environmental reviews be 
performed by consultants who are picked, paid for and accountable to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Fine said the plan really shows the city "is going all out to appease 
developers by guaranteeing a fast-track approval process." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Planning Department Director Kenneth Topping predicted developer 
resistance to the plan. To accommodate this, the city plans to undertake the 
reforms gradually and embark on a "sales job" to persuade developers to accept 
the reforms and break their "longstanding habits," they said. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, the developers should embrace the plan because it will 
shorten the time it takes City Hall to process their projects, Bradley and 
Topping said. Bradley said it takes an average of 18 months to get an EIR done 
and processed at City Hall -- a span that he says can be cut to 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
Developers currently select and hire the consultants who perform the 
environmental impact reports for their projects. These reports, often highly 
technical, are supposed to identify the impacts and propose ways, where 
possible, to mitigate the negative effects of a project. 
</P>
<P>
Developers, for example, often are required to reduce traffic congestion by 
widening streets, installing traffic signals and providing additional parking 
-- all of which can be costly.

ANTONOVICH CALLS BIAS RULING WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich told a federal judge Thursday that Sarah Flores' 
first-place finish in the June primary for a seat on the county board shows 
that the judge was wrong in ruling that the supervisors discriminated against 
Latinos in drawing district boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich took the witness stand during the third day of a hearing before U.S. 
District Judge David V. Kenyon on whether a new county redistricting plan 
corrects violations of the federal Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon is expected to decide early next week whether to accept the plan, which 
places Supervisor Ed Edelman in a new, predominantly Latino district. The 
plaintiffs in the voting rights case want a district without an incumbent to 
improve the chances for the first Latino to win a seat on the board. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Antonovich denied allegations that he and Supervisor Deane 
Dana endorsed Flores in an effort to persuade Kenyon to dismiss the voting 
rights lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The allegation was made under oath Wednesday by Flores' opponent, Superior 
Court Judge Gregory O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
Dana on Monday testified that he had "absolutely not" told O'Brien that the 
lawsuit was the reason he supported Flores to succeed retiring Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum -- a statement that O'Brien said amounted to perjury. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said he met with O'Brien in March and told him, "The plan in 1981 
was not discriminatory, and Sarah Flores' victory will show it." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Flores' first-place finish shows that Kenyon's ruling was "wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Flores, who won 35% of the vote in June, and O'Brien, who received 20%, are due 
to face off in November, but whether the election will proceed hinges on the 
outcome of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said he endorsed Flores because he has known her since high school, 
because of her experience as a longtime deputy to Schabarum and because "she 
was the best qualified." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn on Thursday submitted written testimony objecting to 
the county proposal to add Beverly Hills and Hollywood to his South-Central Los 
Angeles district. Hahn said that would make it "harder for a black candidate or 
a candidate favored by the black community" to get elected.

RTD OKS FREE RIDES IF BUSES ARE LATE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: THE TRIAL PROGRAM IS AN EFFORT TO REGAIN LOST RIDERSHIP. UNDETERMINED 
IS WHETHER THE DRIVER OR RIDER WILL DETERMINE IF A BUS IS LATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A public relations experiment that would provide free rides whenever buses are 
15 or more minutes late won the endorsement Thursday of the Southern California 
Rapid Transit District's governing board. 
</P>
<P>
The board's 8-1 vote gave RTD officials the go-ahead to plan for the four-month 
program, which is slated to begin Sept. 1 and is designed to get people back on 
buses. Since the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, RTD ridership has 
plummeted by about 500,000 customers from a high of 1.8 million daily. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good and bright idea," said RTD Director Marvin Holen, who supported 
the novel concept. 
</P>
<P>
RTD board President Nick Patsaouras, who unveiled the proposal at a news 
conference Wednesday, told fellow board members that the RTD needs to do a 
better job of persuading consumers that public transportation is reliable. 
</P>
<P>
The free rides, he said, are merely a way to provide an attractive alternative 
to cars and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials realize that many freeway commuters simply won't give up their 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried different things in the past," said one RTD official. "Maybe this 
will get them out of the car." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the RTD has been stung by publicity about problems, ranging from 
violence on buses to late buses. Officials concede that a 60-cent fare hike in 
1985, bringing the basic one-way fare to $1.10, drove off customers by the 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
The specifics of the experimental program, which may cost the RTD between $1 
million and $2 million in lost revenue, have yet to be worked out. Among the 
unanswered questions is how the program might affect corporate-sponsored bus 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
Also unanswered is who will decide if a bus is at least 15 minutes late -- the 
driver or the rider. Patsaouras said he thought the often-heard axiom -- "The 
customer is always right" -- should prevail, even if a customer says the bus is 
15 minutes and 1 second late. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the rider should be comfortable and depend (on the bus) to be on 
time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials are expected to work out the details and bring them to the board 
for approval next month. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone on the board, however, favored the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an ill-conceived plan," said La Puente City Councilman Charles H. 
Storing, who voted against it. "It assumes the buses are intentionally running 
late, but a lot of the reasons are traffic congestion, traffic accidents, road 
repairs, engine trouble or train crossings. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to penalize the district is unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
The leader of the RTD bus drivers' union said he favored the idea as long as 
the drivers did not become scapegoats for poor on-time performance. 
</P>
<P>
"A driver could get into a dispute on whether a bus was 15 minutes or 14 
minutes or 12 minutes late," said Earl Clark, general chairman of the United 
Transportation Union. "They got a lot of other things to deal with without 
getting into that." 
</P>
<P>
Several bus drivers in downtown Los Angeles said they supported the RTD board's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"I want happy riders, not hassles," said one Route 30 bus driver as he headed 
toward East Los Angeles. "If it's my fault that the bus is late, the riders 
deserve a free ride." 
</P>
<P>
Another bus driver, battling to keep his schedule to the Eagle Rock Plaza 
shopping center, tersely told a reporter, "Can't talk right now. You don't want 
to make me late, do you?"

FASHION STARTS ON THE BEACH FOR SURF WEAR INDUSTRY 
</P>

"This is our customer, right here," says David Miller, president of Off Shore 
of California, nodding toward the small group of surfers hunkered down in beach 
chairs at Laguna's Main Beach. "You have to come out and look at the 
16-year-olds." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, the new president of Off Shore in Anaheim, says the $1-billion active 
wear industry rides largely on fashion tides governed by teen-agers worldwide, 
and one way to know the waters is to spend time at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Relaxing in the shade of a tree in slacks and an open-necked white shirt, 
Miller himself would not be mistaken for a sand rat, but it is clear that he 
enjoys his business. The occasion is an Off Shore focus group, a low-key 
meeting of the company's management and design staff with members of its 
company-sponsored surf team. Various members of the team are invited to 
participate in a focus group about every two months. 
</P>
<P>
Quiksilver, Billabong, Ocean Pacific Sunwear, and Maui and Sons, all major, 
Orange County-based surf wear labels, also keep their eyes on the beach -- by 
supplying amateur and professional surfers with the firms' latest gear and 
getting feedback from the surfers as to how the clothes fit and wear and what 
the surfers' friends are saying about them. 
</P>
<P>
"We all spend a lot of time on the beach," says Tom Hancock, national sales 
manager at Maui and Sons in Costa Mesa, which sponsors a number of amateur and 
professional surf teams. "It's a very open atmosphere as to what the next 
product should be." 
</P>
<P>
Gemma Turi, Off Shore's vice president of marketing, says: "We always hold 
(focus groups) at the beach, where the young surfers are more comfortable and 
more willing to talk. It's just deadly when you take them into the office." 
</P>
<P>
Off Shore's Miller asks the four surfers invited to this particular focus group 
whether they like the Lycra trunks they've been wearing in the water. The young 
men laugh self-consciously. Lycra is a stretch fabric, so that the trunks, 
unlike traditional board shorts made of cotton or other fabrics, are skin 
tight, making the surfers embarrassed to leave the water. 
</P>
<P>
The group discusses the possibility of making trunks with neoprene -- a thick 
but lightweight synthetic rubber -- along with the Lycra. Judiciously placing 
the neoprene would solve the overexposure problem, they say. The drawback, 
Miller points out, is that the retail price of such shorts would be between $55 
and $65. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Alper, a 15-year-old from Huntington Beach with a Tom Cruise grin, 
suggests Lycra trunks with a flap that would drop down over the front. A good 
place for a logo, someone else suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Miller asks about specific colors. A wet suit in the right colors will attract 
a lot of attention and do wonders for the surfer's visibility. "You (can) have 
a dorky guy making a dorky move, but he looks great," surfer Doug Bury of 
Laguna Beach points out. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Butler, vice president of merchandising for Off Shore, pulls samples of 
some around-town attire from a bulging gym bag. Stone-washed denim in dark, 
muted colors earns the surfers' approval, and a knit fabric goes over well, but 
a madras-like cloth makes Miller nervous about its '60s overtones, although he 
notes it's big in the southeastern states. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting largely confirmed his ideas, Miller says, but he did pick up a few 
tidbits. 
</P>
<P>
Maui and Sons' day-to-day point man at the beach is Darren Brilhart, 25, who 
serves as the manager of the company-sponsored surf team. "I don't make a lot 
of money, but the lifestyle's great," Brilhart says of the job. 
</P>
<P>
Maui and Sons tries out its new styles on amateur and professional surfers, 
supplying them with trunks, shirts, pants and other sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
For surfers, the connection with an active-wear manufacturer offers a modest 
income, a wardrobe, recognition in the sport and attention from peers. For the 
company, besides the feedback, it offers an important route to brand 
visibility. It doesn't hurt to have local heroes wearing your particular brand 
around town. Most local manufacturers sponsor individual surfers on both coasts 
and in Hawaii, and sometimes in Australia. "A lot of kids around here are 
sponsored," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
People at the beach react when Todd Miller, 21, shows up in his latest 
Quiksilver-issue clothes. He hears, "That's killer. Where'd you get that?" 
</P>
<P>
Grant Collins, 17, of Newport Beach, a member of the Maui and Sons surf team, 
says, "If you're out here (54th Street in Newport Beach) every day with a logo 
on your board, people know you've got the new clothes." 
</P>
<P>
While company sponsorship provides just enough renumeration for many of the 
kids to be full-time beach dwellers, they understand their corporate 
responsibilities. "You have to work for it," Collins says. "You have to do good 
for the company, or they shut off the clothes. It's like you're a walking 
billboard." 
</P>
<P>
That can be a competitive sport, too. Darren Brilhart's roommate is Todd 
Miller, who surfs for rival Quicksilver. "Todd and I compete at everything we 
do," Brilhart says. 
</P>
<P>
Quiksilver is more focused on "hard-core surf wear," the two agree, although 
Brilhart says Maui recently came out with Full Circle, a line for serious 
surfing. Of Maui's since-restyled dress-clothes line, Brilhart notes: "Last 
year we got too much into the mall scene. Really fluorescent colors. The team 
said it was too hokey." 
</P>
<P>
The intense interest in active wear among teen-agers and young adults is 
exactly what Off Shore and other active-wear companies are counting on. Off 
Shore is already a $20-million company, and David Miller says he has been given 
the go-ahead by parent Merrill Lynch to take the company to the next plateau. 
"We want to be very fashion-forward -- willing to take a chance on something 
new," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, "we visit specialty stores, surf shops and department 
stores," Off Shore's Gemma Turi says. "You have to travel constantly and 
listen."

A REAL JOB? SELLING CARS? SAY IT AIN'T SO, CORKY

Surf star Corky Carroll, whose reputation for being out of a job was as big as 
some of the giant waves he has surfed, has -- alas -- found gainful employment 
selling cars. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 43, surfing's iconoclast, forged a surfing career while supporting 
himself with such odd jobs as dishwasher, waiter, ski-boot riveter and 
musician. 
</P>
<P>
Those who recall a beer commercial featuring Carroll probably remember its 
punch line, playing on the surfing hero's lifelong job defiance. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's get up, put on a shirt and tie and head for Jim Slemons Honda in San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Corky may have a job, but it doesn't sound 9-to-5. In fact, during a recent 
weekday when a nice, four-foot swell was hitting Orange County beaches, the 
Cork could not be found on the showroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Corky isn't coming in today," a Slemons receptionist said. "He's due to come 
in tomorrow . . . around 3 p.m." DAVID REYES

BUILDING A SURFBOARD STARTS IN SOUTH LAGUNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gordon Clark is not your typical surfing capitalist. He's over 50. He's not 
much of a salesman. He hates beach fads. And his employees don't run around in 
Day-Glo surfwear or hit the beach at lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, were it not for the racks and racks of surfboard-shaped pieces of 
foam, one would be hard-pressed to imagine that Clark's South Laguna factory 
had anything to do with surfing at all. 
</P>
<P>
In one foul-smelling room, respirator-equipped workers pour a 
computer-controlled quantity of viscous white liquid into a small bucket, hold 
it under a stirring machine for a few moments, and then run across the room and 
pour it in thin strips into a long, rectangular mold. Not exactly the laid-back 
image of a beach business. 
</P>
<P>
But this is the guts of Clark Foam, the world's dominant supplier of the 
polyurethane "blanks" that are shaped and then covered with fiberglass to make 
surfboards. It is one of the most venerable -- and probably one of the more 
profitable -- companies in the fast-changing surf business. 
</P>
<P>
Centered largely in Orange County, the surf industry boomed throughout the 
1980s and now generates an estimated $1 billion to $2 billion in sales 
annually. Most of that is accounted for by the clothing firms -- such as Ocean 
Pacific, Quicksilver and Gotcha Sportswear -- that have added the word surfwear 
to the international fashion vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
But surfing has spawned a wide variety of businesses, from tiny firms that make 
surfboard wax or leashes, or distribute surfing movies, or build a few dozen 
surfboards a year, to San Juan Capistrano-based Surfer Magazine and its bitter 
San Clemente rival Surfing. 
</P>
<P>
This year doesn't look to be one of the better ones for the notoriously 
volatile business. Surfer Magazine publisher Steve Pezman and Surfing publisher 
Bob Mignona -- who are loath to agree with one another -- both say advertising 
revenues have leveled off. 
</P>
<P>
And the two magazines, which have played a central role in moving surfing from 
the cultural fringe to the commercial mainstream, are considered good 
barometers of the state of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon (Grubby) Clark, paradoxically, would welcome a return to stable, 
predictable sales. Like a number of his compatriots in an industry where 
salesmen entertain their clients by taking them surfing, Clark seems to view 
making money as something of a sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1980s were the years of the fads," the tall, lanky 57-year-old says with a 
disconsolate chuckle. Though some of his friends are in the clothing business, 
he doesn't have much use for the fashion-defined "surfer lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys figured out they could use surfing to sell rags, and that screwed 
everything up, created a lot more demand than there would have been otherwise," 
said Clark, who was a partner of pioneering surfboard maker Hobie Alter and 
took over Alter's foam business in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
That attitude results in part from the complexity of Clark's operation. Unlike 
a surfwear vendor, he cannot simply buy more fabric and hire more sewing 
subcontractors when business picks up. He has to buy expensive capital 
equipment, such as the 12-foot-high, $50,000 chemical boiler that was recently 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
Raw commodity chemicals are mixed in such tanks at high temperatures to produce 
polyurethane resin, and computer-monitored quantities are then released through 
a hose into buckets and poured into molds. In precisely 26 1/2 minutes, the 
thin layer of foam expands and hardens to fill the mold. 
</P>
<P>
After the foam is removed, a light is shined through it to check for 
imperfections. Then, the blank is sawed in half and a thin strip of wood, 
called a stringer, is placed between the two halves and the whole thing is 
glued back together. 
</P>
<P>
The stringers, which come in many varieties, give the board strength by 
maintaining a constant distance between the sheets of fiberglass that will 
eventually be layered onto the blank. And they also fix the "rocker," or 
end-to-end curvature, of the board. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping track of the hundreds of blanks that are produced each day is not easy, 
since Clark Foam offers 75 different shapes and four different densities of 
polyurethane, for a total of 300 different blanks. 
</P>
<P>
Clark Foam makes all its own cement molds, cuts all the stringers from raw 
lumber and even produces its own glue. "I can't integrate forward because I'd 
be competing with my customers, so I've integrated backwards," Clark explains, 
revealing the strategic thinking that lies behind the self-effacing modesty 
about his business acumen. 
</P>
<P>
The company also makes slabs of polyurethane which are sold to boat makers and 
others who need what is known simply as surfboard foam. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, friendly but evasive, won't discuss his private company's finances. Nor 
will he say how many blanks his 100-strong work force produces each year. 
</P>
<P>
But surfing industry experts believe he produces as many as 100,000 per year 
and commands a majority of the worldwide market for surfboard innards, with the 
balance accounted for by several Australian companies and by large chemical 
firms that sell standard polystyrene foam. 
</P>
<P>
With blank prices ranging from $30 for a basic model up to $200 for customized 
jobs, Clark Foam is certainly pulling in some tidy sums. Enough, at least, to 
give the publicity-shy Clark plenty of time for surfing and trail-bike riding. 
He has a home in Hawaii, as well as one overlooking Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Though he downplays the novel nature of his business -- "I'm just a resin 
producer. We might as well be making toilet seats" -- Clark concedes that he 
enjoys being involved in the design and development of surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
His customers, many of them individual craftsmen and surf-shop owners, "shape" 
the blanks in a variety of ways, cover them with fiberglass, install the fins, 
paint them, and sell them for $300 to $500 retail -- proudly advertising with a 
distinctive logo that they use Clark Foam. 
</P>
<P>
A stable core of customers, in fact, makes Clark Foam among the most fad-proof 
of all surfing businesses. Trends may come and go, but there will always be 
surfboards. And for as long as there have been fiberglass-covered foam 
surfboards, there has been a Clark Foam.

A LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S BEST BREAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If riding waves is your idea of the ultimate in recreation, then the beaches of 
Orange County are the Playgrounds of your dreams. From Seal Beach to San Onofre 
lies a stretch of sand and surf that features fast, hollow tubes, slow, rolling 
peaks, and everything in between. 
</P>
<P>
There are high-powered point breaks, such as Trestles, where some of the 
world's best surfers hone their skills. And there are low-key beach breaks, 
such as Bolsa Chica, where beginners get their first mouthful of saltwater 
while floundering in the white water. Indeed, there's something for everyone 
with a surfboard and a love for the waves. 
</P>
<P>
BEACH BREAK WAVE 
</P>
<P>
At Huntington Beach and other beach breaks, ocean storms and variations in 
swell direction can change the character and size of a beach break wave in a 
matter of days or even hours. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The presence of a continental shelf miles out slows the beach break and 
diminishes its energy. 
</P>
<P>
Shifting sand bars create an alternating pattern of breaking waves and open 
channels allowing surging water to flow laterally in the primary surf zone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offshore winds can smooth and shape the wave into perfect plunging cylinders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water surging toward the shore escapes back to the sea through deep-water 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
POINT BREAK WAVE 
</P>
<P>
waves peel around the point at Trestles and dump onto shore giving the surfer 
one of the best rides in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swell advances toward shore and wraps around the point at Trestles and crashes 
onto the cobblestone beach. 
</P>
<P>

shoulders of the waves.

Map, Huntington Beach: The slow-breaking waves at Bolsa Chica are popular with 
beginners and longboarders. The cliffs is a treasure chest of uncrowded peaks 
that is especially fun in big surf. Huntington Pier is one of the most 
consistent breaks on the coast and maintains good shape under most swell 
directions. ; Map, Newport Beach: The sand bar at the mouth of the Santa Ana 
River jetty produces a fast, hollow wave. the most popular spot in the groin 
field-a series of man-made jetties-is 56th Street, which holds its shape up to 
eight feet. The Point, at 18th Street, can offer some of the biggest ridable 
waves in California. ; Map, Dana Point/San Clemente: Salt Creek features the 
fastest waves in South County. The development of Dana Point Harbor almost 
ruined the surfing at Doheny, but a big south swell still can produce long, 
shapely rights. 'T' Street is a popular break with waves peeling both left and 
right off a triangular-shaped reef. ; Map, San Onofre: Upper and Lower Trestles 
are considered among the finest point breaks in California and are among the 
most heavily surfed spots by Orange County surfers. Church is usually not as 
big, but is also a quality point break. Old Man's at San Onofre State Beach, is 
a slow ride back to surfing's roots. Source: The Book of Waves ; Drawing,

<P>
PROFESSIONAL SURFER, 18 
</P>
<P>
When her two older brothers gave up surfing with her because the water got too 
cold in the winter, Nea Post continued going to the beach on her own, dutifully 
riding her bike the few blocks to Huntington Beach so she could ride the waves. 
</P>
<P>
"I started surfing when I was 13 by just tagging along with my brothers," Post 
said. "Then I decided that this is what I really wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
She quickly progressed. Post became a standout surfer on the Huntington Beach 
High School team and the top-seeded female surfer in the National Scholastic 
Surfing Assn., which has 4,000 members and sponsors contests for students 
attending grade school through college. 
</P>
<P>
Within five years, Post had won four national high school championships, 
several state championships and two open division contests for women held by 
the scholastic group. She placed fifth in the world amateur championships in 
Japan in May, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Now Post has decided to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a lot of time in as a kid," Post said. "I stayed at the beach all day. I 
still try to surf for at least three hours a day, no matter what the 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Post attends Golden West College and has started the Assn. of Surfing 
Professionals tour, the most competitive professional circuit. She is sponsored 
by Ocean Pacific Sunwear Ltd., Altra Surfboards of Newport Beach, Huntington 
Surf &amp; Sport, and Victory wet suits. 
</P>
<P>
She has made surf trips to Australia, Hawaii, Bali, Venezuela, Costa Rica, 
Barbados, Puerto Rico, Japan and Canada for a wave pool demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess my reasons for doing it are pretty standard," Post said. "It's just so 
much fun. I don't get tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
And her brothers are very supportive, she said, adding, "You can never get too 
much support." DAN WEIKEL

ERNIE SCHNEIDER 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER, 43 
</P>
<P>
Tell the Board of Supervisors he's surfin', surfin' USA. 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Schneider who oversees a $3-billion budget and 
16,000 employees, has served almost 20 years in county government -- but he has 
surfed for 30. 
</P>
<P>
Although the pressures of job and family have driven many of his friends from 
the sport, Schneider gets in the water two to three times a week, despite the 
12-hour workdays he puts in for his $110,000-a-year job. 
</P>
<P>
"I am real into sports -- running, handball, weights and triathlons," said 
Schneider, who lives in San Clemente. "But I have never stopped surfing. It's 
what I do best." 
</P>
<P>
His favorite spot is Church's, a point break north of the San Onofre Nuclear 
Power Station. He has been going there with friends since he was a teen-ager. 
These days, Schneider usually loads his 7-foot, 10-inch long board into a tan 
Volkswagen van shortly after dawn and gets in a few waves before heading to his 
executive office at the County Administration Building in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
At Church's he occasionally meets longtime friends such as Chuck Bassett, a 
Costa Mesa fire captain. Sometimes, Schneider's wife, Sally, goes along. But 
his most consistent surfing companion is son Nick, a talkative 8-year-old with 
a tan and crewcut. He attends Truman Benedict Elementary School and started to 
snorkle and surf before he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
"I like surfing more than I think I do," Nick said. "I've surfed 10- to 15-foot 
waves." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, not exactly," said Schneider, who has a pair of hot-pink surf trunks. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, a West German immigrant who arrived in New York a few weeks shy of 
his sixth birthday, began surfing at age 14, shortly after his parents moved to 
Orange County. He eventually earned a slot on the Gordon &amp; Smith exhibition 
team when the San Diego surfboard company had a shop in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
He said surfing provides him a much-needed break from the pressures of 
restructuring the county bureaucracy, dealing with fiscal problems and keeping 
track of the minutiae of government. 
</P>
<P>
"Sitting at my desk in the office and sitting on my board," he said, "it's just 
two different worlds." DAN WEIKEL

CHRIS EVANS 
</P>
<P>
DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY, 35 
</P>
<P>
The aging twin-engine Convair went into a sharp dive, and Orange County Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Chris Evans felt his stomach climb into his throat. A few minutes 
later the passengers were clapping. They had landed safely on the small 
airstrip of Isla Natividad. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't much on the dun-colored island except some of the finest surf in 
Baja California. That was all Evans and his friends needed. Never mind the 
Spartan accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, 35, who has prosecuted some of the county's heaviest organized crime 
figures, is an avid surfer, the kind with a yen every now and then for waves 
south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
"I still like surfing for the same reason I started. It's exhilarating," Evans 
said. "And, it's got every element of a spare-time sport you could want" -- low 
cost, thrills and a little adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, an Anaheim resident, started surfing when he was a 21-year-old county 
firefighter. He has been to Hawaii and popular breaks in Baja California, 
including San Miguel and K-38. But his favorite is Isla Natividad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great," Evans recalled. "The biggest danger is the flight down . . . The 
pilot was 50 or so and the co-pilot was 19. They smoked cigarettes in the 
cabin. It was unreal, but worth the trip." 
</P>
<P>
Evans is prosecuting Dr. Thomas Gionis, charged with plotting an attack on his 
former wife, Aissa Wayne, who is John Wayne's daughter, and her boyfriend, 
Roger Luby, at Luby's Newport Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
He is also handling a case against Robert Paduano, a reputed organized crime 
figure who allegedly tried to take over part of the county's cocaine trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can stop me from surfing," Evans said. "No case, not even the Gionis 
case, can keep me from it. It is not even a close call." DAN WEIKEL

WHITEY HARRISON 
</P>
<P>
LEGENDARY SURFER, 77 
</P>
<P>
With his signature palm hat atop his head and a large surfboard cradled under 
an arm, Lorrin (Whitey) Harrison has become such a familiar sight at San Onofre 
State Beach that he's called "Mr. San Onofre." 
</P>
<P>
This living legend from San Juan Capistrano started surfing in the 1920s. By 
the 1930s, Harrison and his friend, Preston Peterson, used to reign supreme 
over surfing contests held at San Onofre. Then in the early 1930s, he made his 
first trip to Hawaii and survived the crushing waves of the North Shore. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest waves I ever got on was at least 35 feet," Harrison said 
recently. "But I got sucked off the back of it. It was at Avalanche," a 
Hawaiian break, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember surfing (Hawaii's) Sunset Beach and Haleiwa in 1935. There was no 
one else out," Harrison added. 
</P>
<P>
While in Hawaii, Harrison said he met and surfed with fellow surfing pioneer 
Tom Blake and a young Hawaiian named Duke Kahanamoku, who would later help 
foster surfing in Hawaii and California. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Harrison walks slower, and his vision is hampered because of a deep-sea 
diving accident. He scoffs at his large surfboards, which he personally shapes. 
"I like a board that's more narrow. But I'm getting older, and I like a little 
more stability." 
</P>
<P>
He still surfs two or three times a week, dives for black abalone and paddles 
in canoe races. 
</P>
<P>
If a good swell is running, Harrison's blue pickup is probably just around the 
bend. 
</P>
<P>
"He always likes to come down to the beach when the surf is up," said 
Harrison's wife, Cecelia. 
</P>
<P>
"He's my hero," said Dorian Paskowitz, the 69-year-old patriarch of the surfing 
Paskowitz clan. "I truthfully believe that Lorrin can go out right now and ride 
a 15-foot wave. He's the only one in our age group who can probably do it." 
</P>
<P>
Where can you usually find him in the water? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, he's always the one who is farthest out," his wife said. DAVID REYES

LA'S HOTTEST JOB; 
</P>
<P>
OCCUPATIONS: FIREFIGHTERS DO MORE THAN PUT OUT FIRES. A ROUTINE DAY FOR TWO 
CREWS IS ALSO FILLED WITH FALSE ALARMS AND LITTLE EMERGENCIES. 
</P>

<P>
Up in the Antelope Valley, the day dawns hot but humid, the kind of summer day 
firefighters like. Before 8 a.m., Scott Graham is at the wheel of his white 
Jeep -- the one with the PARADOK license plates -- headed for Station 111 in 
Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
At the firehouse, there will be housekeeping chores. This day is hose day. 
Great loops of fire hose drying on the tower must be rolled and stored. The 
kitchen floor and cabinets must be scrubbed. 
</P>
<P>
In a few hours, the other firefighters will want lunch. And Graham is the cook 
today. 
</P>
<P>
On another hot, sticky day, at Station 66 in South-Central Los Angeles, Rick 
Paiz and the other firefighters report for morning lineup. Seated at long 
kitchen tables, they hear Capt. Steven Ventura's announcements -- about new 
coveralls, about an upcoming swap meet and a retirement dinner. 
</P>
<P>
A voice crackles over the PA system. Fire. Within minutes, firefighters have 
pulled on their "turnouts" -- 75 pounds of fire-resistant gear -- and are 
speeding to the scene, a vacant house on South Harvard Boulevard. Riding high 
on the rear of truck 66 is Paiz, the tiller man. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, late summer and fall are fire season, when parched 
brush land and careless campers or crazed arsonists can combine disastrously. 
For firefighters -- the 2,700 men and women who wear the badge of the city and 
the 2,200 who are uniformed members of the county Fire Department -- brush 
fires are just another hazard of the job. 
</P>
<P>
Routinely, they deal with danger and tragedy. Drownings and shootings. Heart 
attacks and overdoses. Structural fires and traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
They are a fraternity, men and women who share a unique life style, a 
commitment that is extraordinary and traditions that die hard. To a large 
extent, they do it for love, not money. Entry-level pay is above $30,000 a 
year; journeyman firefighters earn more than $40,000, captains $60,000-plus. 
And firefighters can double their pay working overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Paiz, 33, is a firefighter assigned to Station 66 on Slauson Avenue in the 
heart of Los Angeles. Scott Graham, 32, is a county firefighter-paramedic, 
based at Station 111 in rural Saugus. Here's a day in the life of each. 
</P>
<P>
Early on a Saturday at Station 111, Capt. Harry Thy, who has 21 years with the 
department, looks out the window to the dry hills of the Antelope Valley and 
muses about the chances of another blaze like the Bouquet Canyon fire that 
blackened 1,000 acres a week before. "That guy likes to start fires on 
Saturdays," he says. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the 111 crew -- a regular complement per shift of six 
firefighters, an engine, a paramedic squad car and a patrol car, plus an engine 
and three men temporarily assigned while a new fire station is being built -- 
has responded to 1,700 calls, only 20% of them fires. 
</P>
<P>
Most are traffic accidents and medical emergencies. Some are tragic, some 
bizarre. There are limits. "We don't generally do cats in trees," Thy says, 
asking, "Have you ever seen a cat skeleton in a tree?" 
</P>
<P>
He is saying, "It's been a tough week" for the men of 111. Two traffic 
fatalities. And two dead children -- a toddler who ingested diaper rash 
medication and a little girl whose skull was crushed by a falling fireplace 
mantle. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the hardest ones, especially for those of us who have small 
children," says Dave Enriquez, who at 25 is the "baby" of this crew. 
</P>
<P>
It is 10 o'clock and already Graham fields questions about lunch. He has 
decided on pasta salad. This younger generation of firefighters is more 
health-conscious. Besides, he says, a heavy meal is not always compatible with 
911 calls. 
</P>
<P>
En route to the supermarket, a motorist flags him down to report a "really bad 
accident." He radios the station, then speeds to the scene, where a maroon 
Dodge Omni has jumped the divider and collided with a white Nissan Sentra. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, anybody hurt?" he asks the Omni's driver, a stout woman in shorts. "Well, 
I've got a terrible headache," she says. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sentra's front seat, the other driver, a Latino man, appears dazed. He 
insists he's unhurt. Graham shrugs. "They always say they have no problem 
because they're not quite legal." He is worried about the way the man looks; 
still, he can't force him to go to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The paramedics take over. Graham heads for the grocery, where there's a special 
on mahi-mahi filets. That will be dinner, along with fresh broccoli and rice. 
Sometimes shopping is cut short by an alarm; he'll just ask a clerk to "stick 
it all in the freezer" until he gets back. 
</P>
<P>
Graham has seven years with the department, 3 1/2 of them at Station 111, which 
handles 100 square miles. Previously, he was a civilian ambulance paramedic. 
Eventually, he hopes to "promote," which means moving to another station, 
gaining new experience. But for now, he's "having too much fun" at 111. 
</P>
<P>
Up here, they talk about Los Angeles as "down below," where violence and drugs 
are rampant, where the only doctor many people know is the Fire Department. In 
the Antelope Valley, people still look out for neighbors and know what their 
kids do. 
</P>
<P>
But up here, long, open stretches of road and drinking drivers are a lethal 
combination. Firefighters figure the odds of encountering a drinking driver on 
the highway: 1-in-4 at midnight; 1-in-3 at 1 a.m.; 1-in-2 at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
This day, Graham stops by the ICU at Henry Mayo Memorial Newhall Hospital to 
see a man he brought to the emergency room early the day before: Drunk driver, 
22. Hit a telephone pole. No seat belt. Thrown from vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
If he lives, the man will be a vegetable. Cases like this would make anyone ask 
who chooses to be a firefighter. It's a question Thy asks himself: "What kind 
of person likes to go into a burning building, or dip his arms into blood and 
body parts up to his elbows?" But he knows the answer: "Maybe we never grew up. 
It provides excitement in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters have seen it all, yet it still gets to them. Graham will never 
forget "the guy who drove his car up one of these canyons, poured gasoline on 
it, set the car on fire and got in." The man, horribly burned, kept screaming, 
"Why did you stop me?" He died the next day. 
</P>
<P>
And there was "the hardest run I ever had," Graham's first time having to tell 
a family that their son had just been killed in his overturned pickup. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, tall and slender with tinted glasses, styled gray hair and mustache, is 
a PR man's dream firefighter. He has been married for six years to Cindy, his 
former dental hygienist. They have three sons. Off-duty, he is a Pop Warner 
Football coach. His idea of a vacation is fishing with other firefighter 
families. 
</P>
<P>
He is a department cheerleader: "I love the job, much as I complain about 
dragging hoses up hills." He still shudders when remembering a high school job 
in a windowless room in a North Hollywood factory: "I went absolutely bonkers. 
I promised myself I would never, ever, ever work indoors again." 
</P>
<P>
But Graham, sooner or later, will "go below" to Los Angeles to learn more about 
structural fires, to promote to engineer and "eventually, down the road, become 
a captain." 
</P>
<P>
This life can be hours of monotony punctuated by moments of stress. A 
firefighter's basic day at the office is 24 hours, with catnaps in the dorm 
between alarms. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters sleep "like there's a baby in the house," says John Harm, who 
figures he has "homesteaded" at 111. He came to the station in 1973 and plans 
to stay until he retires in seven years with 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Because firefighters may work 72 hours straight -- trading time with a buddy or 
volunteering for overtime (at time and a half) -- the station is a second home, 
the crew a second family. In their 11-day labor cycles, they average 96 hours 
work; typically it's 24 hours on, 24 off, 48 hours on, 48 off, 24 hours on, 96 
hours off. 
</P>
<P>
For the men of 111 (there are no women there now), the heart of this second 
home is a multipurpose room with six slightly tattered brown tweed lounger 
chairs, a giant-screen TV the men bought themselves, a long dining table and a 
homey kitchen with microwave and dishwasher. 
</P>
<P>
Cooking is shared and rotated. Washing dishes is another matter. After meals, 
playing cards come out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not looking for a winner," engineer Robert Sklar explains. "We're 
looking for a loser" -- the guy who washes the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
The dealer calls the game, which may be named for a fire captain shot by his 
wife or for a firefighter who lost his thumb when a fire hose got wrapped 
around it. For firefighters, black humor is a coping mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
In the games, bidding is brisk for the extra hand -- 25 cents, 50 cents. Thy 
counts the money in the can -- $120. It buys little luxuries for the station. 
The basics -- condiments, cable TV, newspaper subscriptions -- are paid for 
with house dues, $1.50 a day, $1.75 on overtime. Breakfast and dinner are $3 
each. 
</P>
<P>
This is an atypically quiet afternoon, time for reading and playing cards. 
About 5 o'clock, Graham lights the barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
But before dinner, there's one false alarm vehicle accident; one call to aid a 
42-year-old severe asthmatic in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
The other crew, Engine 73, returns from a rescue call. A boy, 4, with a 
cigarette lighter had set his baby sister's playpen on fire. 
</P>
<P>
The scream of sirens causes suburbanites to rush to their front doors to gawk. 
Kids, flushed with excitement, ask, "Is there a fire?!" They are disappointed 
to learn that someone has fainted, that there has been a fender-bender. 
</P>
<P>
But this is the stuff of firefighters' days. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the station, 9 p.m. The dinner dishes are done. Harm dashes to the 
7-Eleven to get a list of winning Lotto numbers. He recalls the prank, now 
legend, pulled on one firefighter, a setup in which his friends recorded 
"winning" numbers on an answering machine at his station, then bought him a 
ticket with the numbers. Convinced he was an instant millionaire, he told his 
captain what he could do with the job. 
</P>
<P>
The man is still a firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
It is quiet, very quiet. The men joke about staying up until 11 to please the 
"run gods," who may then grant them an uninterrupted night's sleep. 
</P>
<P>
About 1:30, two hours after everyone turns in, the dong-ding for 111 sounds -- 
a fire on the logjammer ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain. But the call is 
canceled before the rig leaves the station. 
</P>
<P>
The next call comes in close to 4 a.m. In a small apartment strewn with toys 
and dirty dishes, a very pregnant woman is in distress, chest pain. She thought 
it was heartburn -- she had spaghetti for dinner -- but Maalox only made it 
worse. An ambulance takes her to emergency; the firefighters return to the 
station. Later, the woman will be sent home. 
</P>
<P>
At 4:15 a.m., over the PA comes a rescue call. A woman, 22, complaining of 
abdominal pain. "When did this come on?" Graham asks her. The day before, she 
tells him. The flu, probably. He manages to remain sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
Around 6:30 a.m., a new day begins. The coffee pot is on. A new shift reports. 
But Graham stays 24 hours more. 
</P>
<P>
At lineup, the new captain tells firefighters that AZT may be made available to 
firefighter-paramedics at high risk through accidental exposure to AIDS. The 
disease "is a concern," as is hepatitis, Graham says later. He wears latex 
gloves and other protective gear but doesn't dwell on danger. "You're either 
going to get it or you won't. You do what you can." 
</P>
<P>
As the bacon and pancakes are about to be served, there is a rescue call: a 
woman, 34, who thinks she may have had a stroke -- "My whole left side is 
fuzzy." Graham takes her left hand and tells her, "Squeeze real tight, kiddo . 
. . nothing to be scared about, everything's working fine." Still, he has 
detected a slight weakness in one leg. The squad follows an ambulance to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Before brunch, there will be two more rescues, an assist on a 4-year-old burn 
victim who will be airlifted from Castaic Lake by Fire Department helicopter. 
Then it's the televised Dodgers-Pirates game and funny car races until 3 p.m. 
when the squad responds to a Magic Mountain call on a woman in line who has 
passed out because of the oppressive heat. 
</P>
<P>
At day's end, Graham shakes his head. "In two years," he says, "I haven't 
worked a day on the engine when we haven't had a brush fire." He attributes it 
to his visitors, ride-alongs observing his shift. Always happens with 
ride-alongs, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Down below," at Station 66, they're talking about a recent shoot-out -- two 
men driving side-by-side down the street, firing at each other. 
</P>
<P>
They're talking, too, about the man who drove a car through the door of their 
garage on July 3, coming to a stop about an inch from a fire engine. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Steve Ventura, on duty that day, recalls: "I heard the gunshots and I 
heard someone scream, 'My buddy's been shot.' " As he watched, the passenger in 
a passing car spotted a fire station, and, grabbing the wheel from the wounded 
driver, steered for the station. Unfortunately, he had no brake control. 
</P>
<P>
The five square miles covered by Station 66 is rife with violence, poverty and 
urban blight. Firefighter Tom Scyphers, who's spent seven years at this 
station, says, "We've seen the ugliest rapes, the ugliest shootings, people 
with their heads blown off. You squeeze in a fire now and then, too." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Paiz is one of 12 firefighters working this 24-hour shift. A firefighter 
for 11 years, he has spent 10 years at Station 66, by choice. He likes a busy 
house. "You hate to talk about someone's misfortune as something good for 
yourself," he says, but when there are fires "you feel like you're earning your 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
This morning, he won't have to wait long to earn it. Soon after 10, he is on 
the roof of a house where a fire appears to have started in the attic. He helps 
chop a hole for ventilation, stripping dry shingles that are like kindling, 
searching for hot spots beneath. 
</P>
<P>
The house, vacant for eight years, was purchased recently and was in escrow. 
The new owner, summoned to the scene, looks on in shock. Her beautiful hardwood 
floors are flooded -- "The only thing I didn't have to fix." 
</P>
<P>
The flames doused, the firefighters, dripping with perspiration, relax for a 
moment. "I'll buy you a drink," one tells another. Both take a paper cup of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
It was a typical house fire, says Ventura, "Ten minutes of firefighting, an 
hour of cleanup." 
</P>
<P>
By 11:30, they are back at the station. At noon, Rick Ramirez, today's 
firefighter-cook, is on the PA. "Come and get it!" There are cheeseburgers, 
canned peaches in the can, cottage cheese in the carton, tortilla chips in the 
bag. No time here for formalities. 
</P>
<P>
Over lunch, Capt. Lee Weber talks about drug labs in the area served by Station 
66. "I've found five-gallon cans of used ether in an alley in back of 
somebody's house," an ingredient for making PCP, Weber says, adding, "They also 
use cyanide. That's what they use in the gas chamber." 
</P>
<P>
Lethal gases are only one concern. Weber recalls a recent house fire when 
firefighters found a man inside, still asleep. "The guy was scared and pulled a 
gun from beneath his pillow." 
</P>
<P>
Weber is a former construction worker, who at 41 has 13 years in the 
department. "About a month ago, I went on a skateboard-by shooting," Weber 
says. " We've had bicycle-by shootings." 
</P>
<P>
But possibly the biggest hazard firefighters face is driving to the scene. 
"Especially now," Weber says. "People are driving with their air conditioning 
on and the stereo up. They don't hear us." 
</P>
<P>
Weber, who is married to a teacher, says, "It takes a very special person to be 
married to a firefighter. . . . Dad's gone. Mom may say, 'You wait till Dad 
comes home.' Well, Dad may not come home till the next morning and Dad may be 
real cranky because he had to get up in the middle of the night." 
</P>
<P>
He adds, "There are a lot of single firemen." 
</P>
<P>
Paiz was recently married, to Laura, who "works normal hours," he says. "It was 
tough at first. She was scared at night. Hopefully, she'll get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
He is happy at Station 66 but knows, "Now that I'm getting older, it's time to 
move on." He hopes to make captain. Above that, he says, "It gets political. I 
don't see myself doing that. But then, when I started this job, I didn't see 
myself being anything but a firefighter. I was having too much fun." 
</P>
<P>
Paiz figures he's in it for the duration, 30 years. It's a dangerous job; he 
loves it. 
</P>
<P>
When he describes big fires he has fought, the first that comes to mind is a 
Ralphs market in the San Fernando Valley, where the roof caved in. He recalls 
it as "a big red wave turned upside down on top of your head." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, inside a fire, Paiz says, "You start to get claustrophobic. You talk 
to yourself, saying 'Calm down, don't breathe too heavy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Being a firefighter is not always the TV drama-type dream. "I've never run into 
a burning building and pulled somebody out," Paiz says. "I have gone into a 
burning house where there were still people inside. Usually, they were already 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
Paiz's home away from home, Station 66, is new, a replacement for the 
61-year-old Florence Avenue facility that was condemned because it was not 
earthquake-proof. Central air conditioning is one new perk; bedrooms in place 
of a single dorm are another. But the jury is still out on that one; some 
firefighters miss the togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
Since the early-morning fire, things have been monotonously quiet at Station 
66. At 6:30, Rick Ramirez, today's cook, announces over the PA, "OK, the moment 
you've all been dreading. Dinner!" It is Mexican stew, with frijoles, rice and 
tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
Just as everyone digs in, the engine company gets a call. Mop-up help is needed 
at a Griffith Park brush fire; soon after, in South-Central, the truck -- 
Paiz's detail -- handles an accident, a Suzuki motorcycle and car collision. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the station, there is dinner to be finished, and a surfing competition 
on TV. Then, while it is still daylight, Ventura takes the truck company to a 
site at 64th Street and West Boulevard, a condemned property where there have 
been several recent arson fires. Then, the crew responds to a house in 
Inglewood where hot wires have been blown down. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, firefighters helped put out a blaze at the 2nd A. M. E. Church 
Church on Hoover and 55th streets. This day, they return to inspect the church 
where there are fire-fighting lessons to be learned. In the vestibule, a huge 
chandelier lies on the tile floor. It fell on a firefighter during the blaze; 
luckily, it struck his compressed air tank. 
</P>
<P>
Today and tonight, there will be no more fires. Since the mid-'70s, fires have 
been fewer. Some attribute that to smoke detectors, to education, to an influx 
of ethnic groups who do not call firefighters because they think they will have 
to pay and are embarrassed to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
The engine crew, which includes one woman, Mary Kay Intyre, a policewoman 
turned firefighter, returns before midnight from Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
Paiz and the others, all but the paramedics, get an uninterrupted night's 
sleep, a rarity at Station 66. 
</P>
<P>
It never fails, Ventura says, when there are ride-alongs. 
</P>

FALLING INTO THE LAP OF LUXURY

This week's winter '91 couture collections have been star studded to a 
near-blinding brightness. At Gianni Versace's Saturday evening show, Sylvester 
Stallone sat in the front row and actress Joanna Pacula walked the runway. Karl 
Lagerfeld at Chanel had Princess Caroline of Monaco wearing a sleeveless white 
silk blouse by Chanel, white jeans and white tennis shoes (no socks) as his 
star guest. And at Yves Saint Laurent's presentation, paparazzi flashed away at 
a usually-blond-now-brunette Catherine Deneuve. 
</P>
<P>
Others seen on the little gold chairs in the front rows at these showings of 
winter haute couture were New York and Paris socialites. Ivana Trump wore an 
orange Oscar de la Renta at the Christian Dior show and fuchsia and white polka 
dots by Emanuel Ungaro at the Ungaro show. Her teased bee-hive hairdo seemed to 
rise to new heights as the week flew by. Slightly less-conspicuous faces 
included Nan Kempner, Lynn Wyatt, Susan Gutfreund and Paloma Picasso, not to 
mention all the titled French women interspersed among them. 
</P>
<P>
After the shows, designers and their patrons attended a series of private 
little dinners. Ungaro gave one for Trump, Christian Lacroix had a sit-down for 
40 in the garden of his couture house, and the house of Dior held a buffet 
supper. 
</P>
<P>
As for fashion, I. Magnin Chairman Rose Marie Bravo described it as "a 
reinforcement of trends we saw in the ready-to-wear collections, with many new 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Among the newer themes were the Empire dress, the bolero jacket and the use of 
heavy satins for evening. Designers tended not to challenge the status quo by 
changing short hemlines established in the fall ready-to-wear collections -- 
except to make them even shorter. 
</P>
<P>
Although ready-to-wear lines shown last March suggested luxurious sportswear, 
the haute couture presentations had little that could qualify as sporty. It was 
luxury all the way. And, finally, perhaps the season's biggest surprise was the 
return of the pouf, or bubble skirt, sometimes swirled into a Gay '90s bustle 
perched on the derriere. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Claude Montana could have claimed a comeback-of-the-year award with 
his Lanvin collection. Like a spoonful of tangy lemon sherbet after too much 
rich chocolate cake, it had a zesty freshness. Montana followed his 
less-than-successful first collection for Lanvin, shown last January, with an 
assortment of far better ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his best looks were the hooded cashmere coats, shaped like a circle and 
cinched at the waist, worn over narrow short skirts and cashmere sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Lacroix's collection also hinted at a new simplicity. The collection 
overflowed with his usual exuberant mix of pattern and color, with rich 
embroideries decorating everything from over-the-knee suede boots to wool coats 
and velvet chiffon evening dresses. But, asked to choose his favorite look, he 
headed for a simple, short, chalk-white crepe dress. 
</P>
<P>
At Ungaro, a group of little black silk crepe dresses came as a relief after 
the richness of Lurex, brocade, feathers, lame, re-embroidered lace and velvets 
plus print and color mixes in vivid shades offered by other designers. 
</P>
<P>
The standout among the black dresses had a high, Empire waist with a 
long-sleeved top completely draped in front and back. The slim, side-draped 
skirt stopped at mid-thigh. 
</P>
<P>
Ellin Saltzman, senior vice president and fashion director of R. H. Macy Inc. 
said: "It's been a very good week. I never thought the little black dress would 
look new again. But there are great ones everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Yves Saint Laurent, who always includes a tuxedo look or two in his 
collections, delighted his fans with a classic tuxedo jacket that turned out 
anything but classic when cut in sheer black lace. The lapels and short skirt 
were heavy black satin. 
</P>
<P>
Saint Laurent was perhaps the only designer who tried to impose a new 
silhouette: The cocoon coat, inspired, he said, by the late Cristobal 
Balenciaga. Sleeves started to widen at the cuff and fell in deep, loose folds 
before disappearing into the hemline. 
</P>
<P>
At Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld sug gested one way to play down hemlines that rise 
blushingly high. He covered the exposed legs with satin, velvet or suede boots 
that extended almost to the top of the thigh. 
</P>
<P>
Lagerfeld showed the line in the old Lido nightclub where the temperature was 
even hotter than those Chanel hemlines. Smart Susan Gutfreund brought along a 
paper fan printed with the U.S. flag and fanned away throughout the show. Among 
the Chanel accessories were the quilted handbag -- everybody's favorite -- done 
in a satin red-rose print, pins of alligators and Scotch terriers, the 
signature camellia as a flat gold brooch and multicolored mosaic bracelets. 
</P>
<P>
Gianfranco Ferre had the disadvantage of showing his Christian Dior collection 
after Lacroix, Jean Louis Scherrer and Gianni Versace where the message was 
color, pattern and pattern mixing. 
</P>
<P>
For eyes still blinded by Versace's red, orange, yellow and royal color blocks 
or Scherrer's magic carpet prints, Ferre's opening group in shades of navy blue 
seemed a mite somber. For day, he included some high-waisted wool crepe dresses 
meant for the very rich and the very thin. 
</P>
<P>
After dark, things brightened up with the rose-red and crimson full-skirted 
short satin dresses whose deep wide decolletes were another signature of the 
Paris fall/winter couture collections.

YSL PROTEGE MAY BECOME HEAD OF HOUSE

He's being called Yves Saint Laurent's protege. Robert Merloz, 24, caught the 
eye of the fashion press last winter with his first collection of furs for 
Saint Laurent. Now the Paris-born designer says of the attention it brought 
him: "I'm shy. I can't hide it. It's overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
Merloz, an assistant to Saint Laurent for almost three years, made his debut 
for the house with the 114-piece collection. 
</P>
<P>
Now, rumors abound that Merloz is the heir apparent and will take over all 
design duties when Saint Laurent retires. 
</P>
<P>
It was Pierre Berge, Saint Laurent chairman, who discovered the new talent. 
Five years ago, when Merloz was a student at the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute 
Couture fashion school, Berge saw his sketches and immediately offered him an 
apprenticeship. He was asked to stay on after graduation to help with the 
ready-to-wear collections. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was asked to do the furs, I was very excited," Merloz said. "Everything 
was a discovery, like a research project." 
</P>
<P>
This first collection featured coats, jackets and wraps that appeared as 
malleable as fabric. "The objective was suppleness," Merloz said after the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
He is very aware of the controversy surrounding real fur, and the strength of 
the animal rights movement. "I go along with it, to the extent that I would 
never use the skins of wild animals -- only animals raised for their skins," he 
said. "But I do feel strongly that, if a woman wants to wear a fur coat, that 
should be her choice." 
</P>
<P>
Working closely with Saint Laurent has influenced his style; there were echoes 
of YSL in many of Merloz's coats and jackets. But the latter's own personality 
emerged in the softer shoulder silhouette, the short coats with shirttails and 
the jewel-studded fur hoods. Other Merloz-isms: a black mink short coat lined 
in shaved red mink and worn with red and black lace-trimmed lingerie, and a 
chinchilla blouson knotted at the hips with a wide satin ribbon and worn over a 
black satin teddy dripping with gray lace. 
</P>
<P>
Tall and boyishly thin, dressed in his navy blazer and gray flannel trousers, a 
mop of black curls descending low on his forehead, Merloz looks more like an 
British schoolboy than the fashion creator he has grown up to be.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: WINNING SPIRIT IN TBS COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's conflict, but not too much conflict. There's pomp, but not too much 
pomp. There's nationalism, but not too much nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
That's because this is not the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are the Goodwill Games not Bigger Than Life, they are even not bigger 
than "Roseanne" or "Cosby" or "The Simpsons" or Barbara Walters interviewing 
Roseanne. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Olympiad, the Goodwilliad doesn't have Roman numerals carved into 
it. This Ted Turner-created minispectacle on cable's TBS could vanish forever 
without even a ripple -- and may, considering its horrendous financial losses. 
After the Aug. 5 conclusion of this year's event in Seattle, the Goodwill Games 
could pack up their 86 hours of coverage and permanently split as 
inconspicuously as when they first arrived on TBS in 1986 like an escapee from 
one of the visionary Turner's dreams. 
</P>
<P>
TBS likes to tout the Goodwill Games as the ultimate in global warming and 
glasnostian dovishness. As a sports-on-TV event, however, they're dispensable. 
And curiously, that is what makes them likable. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the TV studio choreography is sometimes stiff, with standing co-hosts Nick 
Charles and Hannah Storm affixed with Krazy Glue to their spots on opposite 
sides of the set during nightly live coverage, requiring center-stage anchor 
Larry King to swivel almost 180 degrees when speaking to them. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, someone, presumably executive producer/director Tony Verna, has 
attached ostentatious titles -- like "Adversarial Billboard" -- to simple 
things like telling viewers about the evening's matchups. 
</P>
<P>
These are exceptions, however, for one of the things that's so appealing about 
the TBS coverage is the absence of the kind of enormous, smothering production 
typical of Olympics telefasts. No sirens and flashing lights here. No 
five-alarm fires, either. 
</P>
<P>
While United States athletes are unquestionably central to the coverage, 
moreover, the TBS treatment is nevertheless long on internationalism and short 
on the kind of intense jingoism that turned ABC's 1984 Olympics coverage, and 
to a lesser extent NBC's 1988 Olympics coverage, into an electronic Old Glory. 
</P>
<P>
What is this thing about athletes being metaphors for global politics, anyway? 
Yes, yes, we were all just devastated when the Soviets beat our basketball 
team. And I don't know about you, but I was crushed when the Soviets beat our 
guys in water polo Wednesday night. Now let's see if a unified Germany will 
want to join NATO instead of the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Get serious, please. The idea that these athletes are somehow playing for 
national honor is a media-fashioned illusion and about as silly as those caps 
that the water polo teams tie on under their chins with little bows. 
</P>
<P>
Are you telling me that most Americans were really pulling for Carl Lewis of 
the United States to win yet another long jump Wednesday instead of for the 
Soviet Union's Robert Emmiyan, whose father was killed and whose home was 
destroyed in Armenia's terrible earthquake, and whose mother and brother were 
watching the competition from an Armenian hotel in the middle of the night? 
</P>
<P>
King interviewed them by satellite, and although the need to go through an 
interpreter made verbal communication almost impossible, the pictures spoke for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
It was fascinating the way TBS was able to transform this long-jump competition 
-- which some sports reporters found undramatic in person -- into a highly 
dramatic episode of intense human interest and athleticism. One reason was the 
presence of Emmiyan, another the contributions of that pre-eminent track 
analyst Dwight Stones. His superb commentary, along with outstanding camera 
work on the jumpers, helped make this the TV centerpiece of that night's 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was the women's 1,500-meter race that was designated "The Miller 
(Beer) Moment of the Day," a bit of commercial nonsense that TBS engages in 
each night. 
</P>
<P>
The real "moment of the day," however, came during one of those sidebar stories 
that TBS is doing to capture the flavor of Seattle. The "moment" was King's 
hilarious satellite interview with a man identified as Don, a worker at a 
Boeing aircraft plant. 
</P>
<P>
King tried to get Don, who was standing in front of a jet, to tell him what he 
did at the plant. Don stuttered. Then he sputtered. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be nervous," King said. "What, like specifically, did you do on this 
aircraft?" 
</P>
<P>
"Pardon?" Don replied. 
</P>
<P>
King repeated the question. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, haltingly, Don spilled the beans about his job, after which King 
turned to the camera with a grin and said: "I don't own stock in Boeing or 
anything, but I assure you Don is not nervous about making aircraft. Not 
nervous! Just nervous about being on television." 
</P>
<P>
It's this refusal to succumb to the trappings and affectations of anchoring, 
this determination to slice through pretension with a chain saw, that makes 
King the ideal choice as TBS' main man here. After all his years on TV and, 
especially, radio, where he first made his reputation, there is still a rawness 
about King that is very engaging. 
</P>
<P>
As on his CNN series "Larry King Live," there's nothing phony or pompous about 
him here. "I'm from Brooklyn," he said at one point after correcting his own 
pronunciation of "decathlon." 
</P>
<P>
You see it on his face, you hear it in his voice: There is life after the 
Goodwill Games, and life during the games that's unrelated to sports. 
</P>
<P>
At one point that same evening, as pictures from a Seattle fish market flashed 
on the screen, King provided commentary: "Me and da wife, we walked through 
here the other day. You'll love it." 
</P>
<P>
And remember, trust him on this. Mark it down. Bank on it. Don wasn't nervous.

BAD VIBRATIONS: Rep. William E. Dannemeyer repeated his frequently-voiced 
opposition to homosexuality in introducing his motion to expel Rep. Barney 
Frank from Congress for his relationship with a male prostitute (A1). . . . 
"There is something about homosexuality that sets Mr. Dannemeyer to vibrating, 
I don't know what it is," Frank said. "I think that there is a growing 
sentiment in the House of Representatives that Mr. Dannemeyer and reality only 
rarely coincide." Zan Dubin and Bob Schwartz

SKEETERS: An outbreak of the encephalitis virus among birds in the Huntington 
Beach area has prompted a warning from pest control officials. . . . The virus 
does not affect birds but can be transferred via mosquitoes to human beings, 
where it causes brain inflammation. . . . "I don't think we need to sound any 
alarm, but people should be concerned about being exposed to mosquitoes," said 
one official. . . . His advice: Report concentrations of mosquitoes and drain 
stagnant water. A coffee can of water can breed 1,000 mosquitoes a week. Zan

FRANK FORMALLY REPRIMANDED FOR ETHICS LAPSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After three hours of uncommonly rancorous debate, the House of Representatives 
voted overwhelmingly Thursday to formally reprimand Rep. Barney Frank 
(D-Mass.), one of two openly gay congressmen, for ethics violations stemming 
from his relationship with a male prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
The 408-18 vote to reprimand came after the House easily turned aside an 
attempt by Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) to expel Frank, a liberal 
who is widely regarded as one of the brightest members of Congress. The House 
also rejected a motion to censure, which is one step above a reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I had a decent chance to present my case," Dannemeyer said after his 
motion to expel failed by a 38-390 vote. Although the tally was "less than I 
had hoped for," the Orange County conservative said he did not have his eye on 
vote totals when he moved against Frank. "I did it because it was the right 
thing to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reps. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who 
represents southern Orange County, joined Dannemeyer in voting to expel Frank. 
Reps. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach), 
who represents northeastern Orange County, voted against expulsion but for 
censure. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional speech on the House floor, before the vote to reprimand, Frank 
apologized to his colleagues. "These mistakes were mine. . . . All mine," he 
said. "I should have known better. Now I do. But it's a little too late." 
</P>
<P>
Frank, 50, attributed his ethical problems to a 34-year effort to keep secret 
his homosexuality, an effort that he abandoned three years ago with a public 
announcement that he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago I decided that concealment did not work," Frank told members 
who packed the House chamber. "I wish I had decided it earlier." 
</P>
<P>
After the votes, Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House 
ethics committee, told reporters, "I'm very pleased the (House) stayed with the 
committee." 
</P>
<P>
Of Frank, Dixon said, "I think he indicated he made a serious mistake, but he 
wanted to let people know why he had done so, and that is because he is a gay 
person." 
</P>
<P>
The ethics committee, formally known as the House Committee on Standards of 
Official Conduct, recommended a reprimand for Frank last Friday in a 57-page 
report that capped a 10-month investigation of Frank's relationship with 
admitted prostitute Stephen L. Gobie, whom Frank had placed on his personal 
staff at his own expense. 
</P>
<P>
A reprimand is the least serious of three punishments that the full House can 
administer, followed by censure and expulsion. Reprimand and censure require 
majority votes, while it takes two-thirds of the House to expel a member. 
</P>
<P>
Only four representatives ever have been expelled, three of whom were rebel 
sympathizers at the outset of the Civil War. The House has censured 22 members 
and reprimanded six. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics committee found that Frank acted improperly by fixing 33 parking 
tickets, largely accumulated by Gobie while he drove Frank's car on personal 
business. In addition, the committee found that Frank wrote a 1986 memorandum 
on Gobie's behalf that contained "misleading statements" about Gobie and his 
relationship with Frank. The memorandum ultimately wound up in the files of a 
Virginia prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Frank wrote that he met Gobie through mutual friends, when in 
fact, their relationship began in 1985 after Frank contacted Gobie through a 
male escort service. And Frank said that Gobie was adhering to the terms of his 
probation on drug and sodomy charges, when Frank knew that Gobie continued to 
work as a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee rejected charges that Frank knew that Gobie was using his 
Capitol Hill townhouse as a base for a prostitution ring. 
</P>
<P>
That assertion was disputed by Dannemeyer, one of the most severe congressional 
critics of homosexuality and homosexual activism. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going on in America is a cultural war," Dannemeyer told his colleagues. 
"Do we tolerate, do we condone a member of this body who knowingly permits a 
house of prostitution to be operated out of his residence?" 
</P>
<P>
Dornan was among the members who joined in the attack on Frank. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother's a high school teacher. . . . This would have destroyed his 
career, anything even remotely resembling it," Dornan told Frank. "My prior 
careers: As an Air Force officer -- Out! Finished! As a broadcaster on 
television, if I wouldn't resign, I'd be fired. . . . I am going to vote for 
expulsion because you didn't have the honor and decency to resign." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer's assertion that the ethics committee had ignored evidence that 
Frank knew Gobie was using his home for prostitution brought an emotional 
response from Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
"You have just heard the most edited, selected garbage that has ever been put 
forth, in my opinion, in this House," Dixon said, his voice rising. Dannemeyer 
"insults the intelligence and literacy of the members . . . who have read the 
(committee's) report." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon also complained that Dannemeyer, in a letter circulated Wednesday to 
members of the House, had revealed the names of several "innocent witnesses" 
involved in the Frank case, names that Dixon's committee had attempted to keep 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Dannemeyer, you have done a mean and evil thing," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the votes, Frank said he believed Dannemeyer's 
attempt to expel him was due largely to the fact that he is a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something about homosexuality that sets Mr. Dannemeyer to vibrating, 
I don't know what it is," Frank said. He added later, "I think that there is a 
growing sentiment in the House of Representatives that Mr. Dannemeyer and 
reality only rarely coincide." 
</P>
<P>
After Dannemeyer's motion was defeated, the House turned down 141-287 a motion 
by House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) that would have had the effect 
of censuring Frank. Despite Gingrich's call for tougher sanctions, he termed 
the proceedings "tragic" and said Frank "has been one of our brightest and most 
energetic members." 
</P>
<P>
Cox said he voted for censure rather than expulsion because "I think censure is 
the appropriate sanction. The standard for expulsion over the last 200 years 
has been conviction of a criminal offense." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher said only the voters in Frank's district have the right to turn him 
out of office. "I believe it's up to us (in the House) to set standards for the 
way our body operates, but it's not up to us to decide who will sit."

</P>
<P>
DATE SHAKE STAND TASTEFUL ONCE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The quaint little shack is still bright yellow with white trim, still sits 
above the historic Crystal Cove community on Pacific Coast Highway as it has 
for 45 years, and still serves date shakes, fruit smoothies, sandwiches and 
soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
But everything else about the stand has changed. With guidance from the state 
parks system and the county Department of Health, the building's new owners 
have spent $50,000 installing new windows with screens, new siding, a new tile 
floor and a new roof. A metal shield has been inserted inside the walls and a 
foot deep underground to keep out the rats that resulted in a shutdown of the 
stand last April. 
</P>
<P>
"We did an extensive remodel, just what the health department asked for," said 
Arden Flamson, whose family now owns the stand. Flamson's son and 
daughter-in-law, Mike and Katie Flamson, will run the business. 
</P>
<P>
The Flamsons, who also own The Place in Corona del Mar, won the bidding for 
what they now call the Crystal Cove Date Shake Shack last April by offering the 
state the best return for the use of the property. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for their five-year lease of the date shake stand, the Flamsons 
will also have to serve as a concessionaire to the beachgoers on the sand below 
their stand. 
</P>
<P>
"That's in our next phase, which we hope to have ready in about three weeks," 
Arden Flamson said. "We will offer a rental service with umbrellas, beach 
chairs and suntan oil." 
</P>
<P>
The shack sits on land between Laguna Beach and Corona del Mar that is now part 
of the 3,800-acre Crystal Cove State Park. 
</P>
<P>
The state bought the park from the Irvine Co. for $32 million in 1979 and the 
land became part of the park system in 1984, said Jack Roggenbuck, Orange 
County district superintendent of the state park system. With the Irvine Co.'s 
planned development of the Newport Beach coastal area, the park and the date 
shake shack will soon be surrounded by buildings, Roggenbuck said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be an island of green here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The stand has been open since Tuesday, but an official grand opening is planned 
for this weekend, Flamson said. LEN HALL

SLOPE SHIFT BLAMED FOR CRACKS IN HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diane Venstrom first noticed the cracks inside her Mission Viejo house about 18 
months ago. Then, the concrete patio began slowly breaking away from the 
foundation of the home. And finally, Venstrom learned that at least three 
neighbors had similar cracks in their houses. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Venstrom and her neighbors received more troublesome news when 
Converse Consultants, an Irvine-based geological firm, told the City Council 
that a water-saturated slope along Campo Moro road is sliding toward houses on 
Ayamonte. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving the geological report, the council approved $600,000 to ensure 
that the homes are not threatened with collapse, Mayor Christian W. Keena said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure who is responsible for the problem," Keena added, "but we want 
to take the right measures before a disaster happens." 
</P>
<P>
Venstrom said that she and her neighbors contacted their homeowners association 
when they noticed the cracks inside their houses and in the retaining wall that 
runs along Campo Moro. The association patched the cracks in the road, planted 
additional shrubs on the slope and reduced watering, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The city-commissioned geological study revealed that excessive watering of the 
slope had caused cracks in the roadbed extending at least six feet deep in some 
places. 
</P>
<P>
Keena said the city plans to install several layers of non-expansive soil in 
its planned reconstruction of Campo Moro, and noted that the problem was 
becoming too common in Mission Viejo. Several weeks ago, a slope at the Mission 
Viejo Mall collapsed, triggering a mudslide near Interstate 5. Keena said the 
city would also spend almost $400,000 to repair road erosion along Alicia 
Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you have to wonder if there's a problem with the design of our 
streets," the mayor said. "My biggest concern is that we're not sitting on a 
major problem here. . . . You have to make a special effort when you put houses 
on hillsides." 
</P>
<P>
Venstrom said her house is "very livable" and that she is not panicking. But 
she said she hopes that the city moves quickly to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my home. I don't have money to move or fix it," she said. "I hope they 
do something because it's the only thing I have." DAVAN MAHARAJ

CHALLENGERS FEW IN SCHOOL ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Incumbents in the four main school board races in South County face few new 
challengers, and some incumbents have yet to file with two weeks remaining 
until the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective candidates have until Aug. 10 to file papers with the county 
registrar of voters to run in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
In districts where no incumbents are seeking reelection, the filing deadline 
will be extended to Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
In the Capistrano Unified School District, all three incumbents are seeking 
reelection but only one challenger has announced intentions to run. The 
incumbents are Crystal Kochendorfer of Laguna Niguel, Annette Gude of Mission 
Viejo and Paul Haseman of Laguna Niguel. Gude and Haseman are officially 
entered in the election, having returned their filing papers, but Kochendorfer 
has yet to return her statement. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Payton, president of the Moulton Niguel School Parent Faculty Guild and an 
activist in a recent boundary dispute there, said she plans to run for the seat 
held by Kochendorfer. Payton, who has not taken out candidate papers, said she 
plans to file for the election Aug. 8 when she returns from a trip to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
All three incumbents on the Saddleback College Board of Trustees are running 
again. They are Marcia Michiker of Mission Viejo, Iris Swanson of San Clemente 
and Joan J. Hueter of Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Interest seems to be low in elections in the Saddleback Valley Unified and 
Laguna Beach Unified school districts, where neither the incumbents nor any new 
challengers have filed for office. CHERYLANNE BEALER

RESIDENTS GET WORD ON RECYCLING EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Curbside recycling will begin early next month, when 22,000 bright orange 
containers are distributed throughout the city, two to a home. 
</P>
<P>
A flyer sent to residents this week asks them to separate trash into three 
categories. One orange bin will hold aluminum cans and glass bottles and jars; 
the other is for newspapers. Residents will continue to use their own 
containers for the remaining trash, and the collection schedule will not 
change. 
</P>
<P>
The instructions require that caps and lids be excluded from the glass bin and 
that magazines, phone books, catalogues and other non-newspaper materials be 
left out of the second bin. 
</P>
<P>
Toxic materials should not be included in trash to be collected at curbside. La 
Habra residents may take hazardous materials to a center in Anaheim at 2761 
White Star Ave. between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Trash collection will continue to be handled by Western Waste Industries, 
operating out of Santa Fe Springs, and using vehicles with three compartments, 
said Gallina. 
</P>
<P>
The flyer warns that scavenging of recyclable items from curbside containers is 
illegal. "We're going to have a hard time with the scavenging," sanitation 
foreman Joseph Gallina said. "If we find a guy in a pickup truck throwing 
aluminum cans in the back, you bet your boots we're going to arrest him." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter accompanying the flyer, Mayor Beth Graham notes, "Regulations 
require cities and counties to reduce by 25% the amount of refuse taken to 
landfills by the year 1995." 
</P>
<P>
Trash collection charges were recently increased from $7.23 to $9.18 monthly to 
help fund the new program. 
</P>
<P>
Gallina said he hopes the recycling program will forestall further increases. 
He said landfill charges are expected to continue going up but that reducing 
the volume of refuse and generating revenues from the sale of recyclables may 
offset rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
According to City Manager Lee Risner, efforts will soon be under way to 
separate grass cuttings and other "green waste" from city parks for compaction 
or eventual composting. DAVID F. BURKE

RESIDENTS SUE CITY TO BLOCK APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Tustin residents sued the city Thursday in an effort to reverse a 
City Council decision on a controversial apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
The 16 residents of Myrtle and Corla avenues represented by Tustin attorney 
Stephen Johnson say the nearly completed, 2 1/2-story Pasadena Avenue apartment 
complex towers over their homes and destroys their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt at compromise, the City Council recently decided that the top 
story of the rear four units should be removed, but residents were not 
appeased. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm right in back of the apartments, and even if they take the top story off 
the end, the first story would look into my back yard because it would actually 
be a 1 1/2-story apartment with the garages underneath," Kathleen L. Arnold 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While Johnson claims the council did not make the findings necessary for its 
conclusion, City Atty. James Rourke said officials considered everything and 
made a "reasonable decision." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute ignited last spring after neighbors complained about the project. 
Staff members revoked the existing permit after discovering that 17 property 
owners never received notice of a hearing last year when it was approved. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Planning Commission unanimously voted to deny developer Feridoun 
Rezai a new permit, the City Council voted 3 to 2, with Earl Prescott and Jim 
Potts dissenting, to issue a new permit with several conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city may face a lawsuit from the developer as well. Beverly 
Hills attorney Joel Ward said he is waiting to hear from the bank about the 
financial feasibility of removing the top story from four units before deciding 
on any legal action. But Ward said Rezai is losing about $1,000 a day. SHANNON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BOY HIT BY CAR IN CRITICAL CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-year-old Santa Ana boy was listed in critical condition Thursday suffering 
from injuries received when he darted into the path of an car and was hit, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardo Rodriguez was taken by paramedics to Western Medical Center in Santa 
Ana on Wednesday night after being struck by a vehicle as he attempted to cross 
in the 900 block of South Harbor Boulevard at about 9:05 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's injuries included trauma to the head, a pelvic fracture and a broken 
left leg, according to a hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the driver of the car, who was not cited, apparently did not see 
the boy, who was crossing in the middle of the street and not at a crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
Although the incident is still under investigation, police spokeswoman Maureen 
Thomas said it does not appear that drugs or alcohol were involved.

SMOLLER ADS LINK LEWIS TO SCANDALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic candidate Fred Smoller, who is challenging Assemblyman John R. Lewis 
(R-Orange) in the Nov. 6 election, launched an early television attack against 
his opponent Thursday with an ad that criticizes his involvement in two recent 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial, which is to air on cable television in Orange, highlights 
Lewis' indictment last year for a fake signature of President Reagan's on 
campaign literature without permission from the White House. The ad does not 
mention that the charge was dismissed by an appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was also criticized in the commercial for his connection to the so-called 
poll guard case, in which Republican Party officials placed uniformed guards at 
polling places throughout Santa Ana on Election Day in 1988. Smoller's 
television commercial charges that the guards were hired "to frighten Latino 
voters." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis has admitted that he attended meetings at which the hiring of the guards 
was discussed. At one meeting, according to court documents, Lewis joked about 
driving green vans around the polling places to give the impression that 
Immigration and Naturalization Service agents were lurking. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis dismissed the attack Thursday, saying that he has been cleared in 
connection with both cases and adding that he is confident of reelection 
because he is more philosophically compatible with the predominantly Republican 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"He can say whatever he wants, I don't think it will have any effect on the 
outcome of the election," Lewis said. "The bottom line is going to come down to 
the fact that Fred Smoller is a college radical who never grew up. I think I 
represent a very conservative district." 
</P>
<P>
Smoller, a college professor, acknowledged that he had a difficult task in 
trying to unseat a five-term incumbent assemblyman. But he said Lewis' 
controversial recorded motivated him to run. 
</P>
<P>
Smoller said his commercial will air on 10 consecutive evenings -- starting 
tonight -- on cable television in Orange, the heart of Lewis' 67th Assembly 
District. Smoller said it cost only $55 to broadcast the 30-second commercial 
for all 10 evenings. DAVE LESHER

DOGS FIND 26 ALIENS IN BOX ATOP TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-six illegal aliens bound for Orange County were found "packed like 
sardines" in an 18-inch-high sealed attachment to a delivery truck roof early 
Thursday morning, the U.S. Border Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The 18 Mexicans and eight Salvadorans were on their way to Irvine, about 20 
miles from the San Onofre checkpoint where they were discovered. Each had paid 
$300 to be smuggled from the border, supervisory Border Patrol Agent Michael 
Gregg said. No one was seriously injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The passengers had been in the poorly ventilated compartment for more than 
three hours when agents found them. Gregg said the sealed compartment ran the 
length of the 1964 Ford bobtail truck, which looks much like a small delivery 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
"This could have been a very tragic situation. There were women in there and 
one elderly gentleman over 70 years old," Gregg said. No small children were in 
the compartment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the passengers were suffering from slight delirium from the heat when 
they were removed from the compartment, which was about 20 feet long. No one 
was hospitalized, Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck, a San Diego resident, was arrested and will be charged 
in connection with transporting illegal aliens, Gregg said. His name has not 
been released, pending arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg said agents, who stopped the truck at 3:30 a.m., noticed the freshly 
painted box had a seam that looked unusual. He said agents suspected a false 
compartment had been added to the top. Canine units detected the hidden people. 
</P>
<P>
Agents had to climb on top of the truck cab to peel back the sheet metal that 
formed the top of the truck and pry the top open. Gregg said the compartment 
was very tightly sealed shut. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the aliens will be returned to their country after questioning, Gregg 
said, although some will be retained as material witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Alien smugglings are not uncommon. The fact that you have a large number of 
people crammed into such a tiny space makes this case unusual," Gregg said. 
"That's an extremely dangerous situation for those people. They could have been 
abandoned by the smuggler or great injury, even death, could have resulted from 
the poor ventilation." 
</P>
<P>
Gregg said the compartment's construction and the type of truck used indicate 
the smuggling might be a part of a professional operation. 
</P>
<P>
The aliens most probably had been picked up near the border, although the exact 
location has not been pinpointed yet, he said.

SCHOOLS TO INVESTIGATE POWER LINES

School board members said Thursday night they plan to investigate possible 
health hazards presented by electromagnetic fields at school sites. 
</P>
<P>
"We do need to be prudent; we do need to be cautious; but I think all of us are 
in agreement: We do need to proceed on this," said Fountain Valley School 
District board member Stephen J. Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
But board members did not respond publicly to a request by parents for 
independent testing at each school site. They said that information presented 
by Supt. Ruben L. Ingram was a good start, but that they needed more data. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram said that board members, in closed session before the meeting, took a 
position on an offer presented two weeks ago by Allen Brandt, attorney for the 
parents. Ingram declined to elaborate on the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said at the last board meeting that he would pursue an existing lawsuit 
against the district and file additional suits unless the district conducted 
independent testing at all schools before the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said the parents would drop the lawsuit if the district agreed to 
independent testing. Measurements of electromagnetic fields taken by the 
parents have differed from those offered by officials of Southern California 
Edison Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of electromagnetic fields has aroused the interest of many parents, 
who worry that power lines at local schools present a health risk to their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
While the parent group points to studies suggesting a link between prolonged 
exposure to electromagnetic fields and some cancers, Edison officials say no 
proof exists that the exposure causes health problems. 
</P>
<P>
Edison has offered to test the intensity of electromagnetic fields at all 12 
schools in the district, but parents have pushed for independent readings. 
</P>
<P>
Edison official Brian Bennett said Thursday night that he would accept an offer 
by Brandt to tour several school sites and test the electromagnetic fields 
there, each with his own equipment.

A 48-year-old man was killed Thursday when a pickup truck struck him from 
behind as he walked along Katella Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
James William Marcotte of Orange was pronounced dead at UCI Medical Center 
shortly after the incident, which occurred at about 2:40 p.m., Orange Police 
Lt. Art Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the 1989 Dodge pickup, Carlos Dwayne King, 30, of West Covina, 
was arrested at the scene on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and later 
booked into Orange County Jail, Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were indications that he (King) had been drinking," Romo said. Results 
of lab tests on King's blood-alcohol level were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Marcotte had been walking east along the curb in the 1700 block of West Katella 
Avenue when he was struck from behind by the eastbound pickup, Romo said.

POPULARITY OF BIG A LANDMARK HASN'T BEEN DIMMED BY AGE;

<P>
ANAHEIM STADIUM: ANGEL AND RAM FANS FIND STRUCTURE THE PLACE TO MEET AND EAT 
BEFORE A GAME.

<P>
Ever since the Big A was moved out by the 57 Freeway, the darn thing just 
hasn't worked right. 
</P>
<P>
Neither have the Angels -- but one has to suppose that is part of their charm. 
</P>
<P>
The club played its first season in the enclosed Anaheim Stadium in 1980 after 
the Big A scoreboard had spent nearly 15 seasons behind the left-center field 
fence. The stadium was enclosed to accommodate the Los Angeles Rams, who moved 
to Anaheim in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-foot wide halo on the Big A used to light up for home runs and would 
shine after Angel victories (though in those days, there was not much chance of 
blowing a fuse). 
</P>
<P>
Many were upset when plans were announced to enclose the stadium for the 1980 
season and move the Big A. But it now may be more popular than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Today, fans like the Big A just where it is. Though many still say they liked 
the stadium better when it was open, few complain about the Big A, which has 
become the place to meet. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to congregate before a Rams game, Angels game or anything at 
Anaheim Stadium, look for the Big A. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good symbol for a meeting place," Sean Stiemlee of Huntington Beach 
said during the Angels' recent home stand. "I've been to 12 stadiums and it's 
one of the best things about this stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"The big, iron A . . . It works as a meeting point. You can see it from 
anywhere. No one can miss it." 
</P>
<P>
The Big A, which is 234-feet tall and weighs 240 tons, has had problems since 
July 17, 1979, when it was moved. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, approximately 1,000 people watched as contractors used a 125-ton 
crane, two huge dollies and lots of cable to move the Big A. 
</P>
<P>
But as a moving experience, it was all too brief. 
</P>
<P>
The Big A made it about 10 feet when a dolly under its base started to tilt. 
That put the engineers and stadium officials on edge -- as well as the Big A. 
Adjustments were made and the Leaning Tower of Anaheim finally made its 
1,290-foot trip across the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was to use the scoreboard to announce upcoming dates and advertise 
stadium events. At first, it worked fine. But by 1984, the scoreboard was shut 
down because of performance problems. 
</P>
<P>
But you can't read the scoreboard while you're standing under it. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's little Eiffel Tower provides shelter when it rains, and shade in the 
summer -- the Big A regulars move east with the shadows for their picnics -- 
and it's a great reference point for finding lost cars. Plus, it has the 
advantage of being near the Katella Avenue entrance/exit, which offers the 
easiest freeway access, on the east side of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It's a perfect meeting place for a big group. During the recent home stand, 
Unisys and TRW were among those having employee picnics under the Big A. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Gillepie of Mission Viejo even likes the concrete base of the structure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great place to barbecue because of the raised cement," Gillepie said. 
</P>
<P>
And although it's illegal to drink alcohol in the parking lot, many of the 
people under the Big A take the risk. 
</P>
<P>
"They're usually pretty lax about it for Angel games," Gillepie said. "For Rams 
games they're a little more up-tight and they might take it away, but they 
usually leave you alone if you pick up your trash." 
</P>
<P>
While the party goes on under the Big A, the argument goes on inside the 
stadium whether the enclosed structure is better for baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it better the old way," John Avella of El Toro said. "It gave the 
stadium more . . . personality." 
</P>
<P>
Others disagree. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it better this way," Mike Nabrotzky said. "I like a fuller stadium. 
There's less wind and I think the (crowd) noise reverberates." 
</P>
<P>
Others don't care, just as long as the Big A stands. 
</P>
<P>
"I helped construct this thing in high school," said a man who would only 
identify himself as Steve because neither his wife nor his boss knew that he 
took a day off to go to an Angel game. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked on it during summer vacation. It was fun growing up in Anaheim then. 
We saw Disneyland go up and then this."

Six years after it conked out and 11 years after it was moved, the Big A is 
scheduled to light up again. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Stadium will spend $642,000 from stadium operating funds to renovate 
the Big A and hopes to have it ready by Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The scoreboard never had any serious problems until it was moved from behind 
the left-center field fence to the edge of the 57 Freeway in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"All the electrical parts were continually failing and we had to keep buying 
replacement parts until they didn't make parts any more," said Greg Smith, 
Anaheim Stadium's general manager. "Then we started cannibalizing -- taking 
parts from one line of the board to fix the other parts." 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't last, either, and the Big A was completely shut down in 1984. 
"That one was actually a scoreboard," Smith said. "This one will be more 
versatile. It will have a full matrix board, like the one inside the stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the scoreboard, the structure will be checked by engineers and 
reinforced if needed and new lighting will be installed so the A and the halo 
can be lit at night. ARA NAJARIAN

READICARE WILL ADD 6 CENTERS FOR $2 MILLION

ReadiCare Inc., the West Coast's largest operator of medical centers that treat 
workers compensation cases, said Thursday that it plans a $2-million expansion 
program to add six new facilities in California and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The additional sites, scheduled to come on line by November, will bring to 50 
the number of medical service centers owned, managed or under development by 
ReadiCare on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The new centers will include one being acquired for an undisclosed price in the 
San Francisco Bay Area and one, already owned by ReadiCare, that is being 
reopened in Sacramento because of burgeoning business in that area, said 
ReadiCare chief executive Dennis G. Danko. 
</P>
<P>
Danko said he expects those two centers to add at least $2 million a year to 
ReadiCare's revenue, which totaled $26 million in the company's fiscal 1990, 
which ended Feb. 28. ReadiCare reported earnings of $1.7 million for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Danko declined to estimate revenues from the four centers that will be built as 
part of the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"Our expanded network will enable us to accommodate increasing patient volumes 
in existing geographic markets, as well as permit us to add complimentary 
workers compensation services, such as outpatient rehabilitation, orthopedics, 
magnetic resonance imaging and others," Danko said.

TUSTIN HOSPITAL ACQUIRED BY WASHINGTON COMPANY

<P>
Healthcare Medical Center of Tustin, a 203-bed hospital, was acquired Thursday 
by a hospital management company in Kirkland, Wash., headed by a former 
Healthcare executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Concept Health Group Inc. plans to expand the hospital's service area deeper 
into Irvine and develop new centers for oncology and sports medicine, said 
company Chairman Michael D. Drobot, who was the hospital's executive director 
from 1980 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Concept purchased the hospital on Newport Avenue from Healthcare International 
Inc. of Austin, Tex. Terms of the sale were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital has been troubled by low patient occupancy, filling only 25% to 
30% of its licensed beds on an average day. 
</P>
<P>
But Concept officials said they hope to increase the hospital's popularity by 
developing an oncology group and a sports medicine complex staffed by 
orthopedic surgeons. Both facilities would target Irvine residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We're closer to Irvine than any other hospital," said Dorn Johnstone, 
associate executive director. "We need to do more marketing." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital has also embarked on a $13.5-million expansion plan to build a 
medical office building and purchase additional land near the hospital grounds.

BRIEFCASE / REAL ESTATE: BUILDERS AND REALTORS SPEND MORE ON ADVERTISING IN 
SOFT HOUSING MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by John O'Dell, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Operating on the theory that there really is a silver lining in every cloud, 
someone had to be making out in the current housing crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Now we know who. 
</P>
<P>
Builders and realtors are spending tons of money these days on advertising and 
marketing as they scramble to woo prospective buyers in a buyer's market. 
</P>
<P>
The ad agencies and marketing firms are all privately held and don't like to 
talk about earnings. (One marketing specialist did let on recently that she has 
more business than she can handle.) But a clue as to what's going on these days 
comes from Standard Pacific, the Newport Beach-based residential builder. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing its second-quarter financial data recently, Standard Pacific said 
earnings fell 35%, even though net revenue was slightly higher than in the 
year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Why were earnings so much less when sales stayed the same? 
</P>
<P>
The official word was that "earnings continued to be impacted by both a 
softening of the California housing market and a change in product mix." 
</P>
<P>
What that means, in English, is that to battle the "softening" market, Standard 
Pacific has been spending a lot on advertising -- money that last year went 
straight to the profit column, said April J. Morris, vice president for 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1989 second quarter, we had to do little if any advertising" because 
people were lining up and begging to buy homes at almost any price, Morris 
said. "Now, the number of ads being published is up considerably." 
</P>
<P>
Morris wouldn't give any specifics about her own company's ad budget except to 
say that the expenditures accounted for a considerable drop in profit. 
</P>
<P>
Also eating into the company's profits -- as is the case with most builders -- 
is the buyer-driven shift away from high-priced homes toward more moderately 
priced homes.

It's too bad that backs don't come with owner's manuals, because most people 
abuse them and pay with pain. 
</P>
<P>
Bad body mechanics add up to bad backs. Be kind to your back and follow these 
tips from experts at Hoag Hospital's Back on Track program and the YMCA's Y's 
Way to a Healthy Back: 
</P>
<P>
* Lifting: It's how you lift, not what you lift. Bend at your knees, not your 
waist. Use your legs, not your back. Put the stress on leg muscles, which are 
larger and stronger than back muscles. Hold the object close to your body, 
because the farther away it is, the heavier it is. If something seems too heavy 
to lift, ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
* Twisting and reaching: Twisting your back unnecessarily when reaching for 
something puts stress on your spine and the supporting tissues. Use that swivel 
chair like you're supposed to and turn it when you reach for something. Keep 
your knees pointed in the direction that you are reaching to avoid stress on 
the spine. 
</P>
<P>
Don't strain to reach that jar on the top shelf of your kitchen cabinet. Keep a 
stepping stool handy or, if it's an item you use frequently, move it more 
within range. 
</P>
<P>
* Standing: Shifting your position when standing for long periods helps avoid 
back strain. Placing one foot on a small stool also helps. If there's a cabinet 
below the sink, when you are washing dishes, open one door and rest one foot on 
the floor of the cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Everything you've heard about the importance of good posture is true. Slouching 
and slumping create back stress that can result in considerable pain. 
</P>
<P>
* Sitting: Make sure your chair is at the right height and provides good 
support. Consider purchasing a lumbar roll to place in the small of your back 
for better support. There are several kinds on the market, including ones that 
are inflatable and fold up for travel. There are also special support systems 
for use in automobiles. Medical supply companies and the Back Stop in Orange 
carry these products. 
</P>
<P>
* Sleeping: A firm mattress is best, but you should shift position frequently. 
Never sleep on your stomach. If you sleep on your back, placing a pillow under 
your knees helps to put your spine in correct alignment. Bend your knees when 
sleeping on your side, and you can use a pillow then too. 
</P>
<P>
Other suggestions from the Y's Way to a Healthy Back include: Exercise 
regularly to strengthen and condition muscles, develop strong abdominal muscles 
to provide support for the lower back, maintain your ideal weight and eat a 
balanced diet. NANCY JO HILL

STYLE: IVANA'S FRENCH TWIST IS NOW ALL THE RAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, Kathryn Bold is a regular contributor to Orange County View.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since Ivana Trump appeared on the May cover of Vogue looking 15 years younger 
and sporting a blond topknot on her head, Orange County hair stylists have been 
doing the twist -- the French twist. 
</P>
<P>
In a single sweep of her tresses, Ivana showed women everywhere how a new hair 
style, not to mention a little plastic surgery, could turn one into a youthful 
cover girl. 
</P>
<P>
Almost overnight, stylists began getting requests for French twists from local 
Ivana-bes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing more up-dos than we've done in a long time," says David Cope, 
owner of Copa de Ramo in San Juan Capistrano. "The style is soft and pretty, 
and we haven't had pretty in a long time. Everything's been hard and angular 
and bobbed." 
</P>
<P>
In a given week, he has about a dozen clients asking for some variation of the 
French twist. 
</P>
<P>
At Flora Hills in Corona del Mar, soft, casual twists with tousled tops have 
become desirable among clients wanting a change, as Ivana did. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime a woman wears her hair up it makes her feel sexier," says Flora Hills, 
owner of the boutique and salon. 
</P>
<P>
Like Ivana, some of Hills' customers want a French twist to go with their new 
face lifts. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times a face lift isn't that drastic of a change," Hills says. "But 
if a woman changes her hair style, her clothes and her makeup, she'll have a 
whole new look. She'll even begin to walk differently." 
</P>
<P>
The French twist has been out of favor for so long, many women don't know what 
to call it. They just ask for a 'vana. 
</P>
<P>
"Ivana went from one extreme look to another, and people noticed the hair 
style. It looked great on her," says Shelly Serrecchio, owner of Cy-Raks salon 
in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Other customers, especially younger women, want the tousled twist made famous 
by Claudia Schiffer and her seductive ads for Guess? jeans. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody notices that girl," Serrecchio says. 
</P>
<P>
The French twist Schiffer wears differs from the Brigitte Bardot version that 
inspired it. Schiffer's is a lot messier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more relaxed and sexier than the '60s," says Sharon Orr, salon manager of 
Aida Grey in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. "It has a little pouf to it, but I 
don't want to say bouffant because I don't want to scare people." 
</P>
<P>
Today's twist calls for a less structured look with loose tendrils of hair 
falling around the face. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the French twist had more of a beehive look, almost as if the 
head was pointed in back like a cone head," Cope says. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the twist should look "as if you grasped the hair in one hand, twisted 
it and stuck one pin in it. That's the effect you want," Cope says. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes that's a lot harder to achieve than a sleek look. Anybody can 
back-comb and spray, but it's harder to make it look messy. You have to have a 
good eye to know when to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Myla Renee, a stylist at Aida Grey, practiced doing a twist on fellow stylist 
Pam Frey, who sometimes wears her blond hair in a French twist to work during 
the day or to go dancing at night. 
</P>
<P>
Renee begins by using hot rollers to put soft waves in Frey's fairly straight 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
"If the hair is straight and silky, the style will slide right out," Renee 
says. "You wouldn't need to do this for processed hair." 
</P>
<P>
With a round brush and blow dryer, she adds slight curl to the bangs at the 
crown to create the volume needed for a tousled top. A gel or mousse can also 
give a little lift to hair that tends to fall flat, Renee says. 
</P>
<P>
To make the twist, Renee pulls the hair up and toward the back for an uplifting 
look. She sweeps the hair to one side, anchors it in place with a row of bobby 
pins, then twists the remaining hair with her hands. 
</P>
<P>
She secures the coil up along the back of the head with more bobby pins. When 
she comes to the end of the twist, the remaining hair is wrapped around in a 
loose topknot. 
</P>
<P>
Renee leaves wispy tendrils of hair to frame the face, picking at them with a 
small comb and squirting them lightly with hair spray to add fullness. 
</P>
<P>
"It should look as if you just stepped out of a convertible," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Stylists can invent endless variations of the French twist. The bangs can fall 
forward, as Ivana's do, or sweep to the side, as the Guess? model's do. The 
topknot can be large or small, and sit either forward or toward the back of the 
head. For Ivana, the grander the affair, the larger her topknot. 
</P>
<P>
French twists work best when one has shoulder-length hair. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobs won't work," Serrecchio says. 
</P>
<P>
Older women like the style because it lifts up from their face, giving them a 
youthful appearance. Younger women, meanwhile, look more sophisticated with 
their hair up. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can wear a French twist," Serrecchio says. "I've done a 16-year-old 
girl who was going to be in a wedding, and I've done a modified version for 
older women that wasn't as messy." 
</P>
<P>
Stylists say the twist is especially popular with brides and bridesmaids 
because it looks sophisticated and complements the headpiece. Others wear it to 
the beach, to work or to parties. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Beck, a stylist at Europa International in Fashion Island, Newport Beach, 
says his clients want a French twist to wear to special occasions, such as a 
night to hear a performance by Opera Pacific or a formal fund-raiser. At a 
recent fashion show for Nordstrom, Beck gave all models with shoulder-length 
hair a French twist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a really uplifting look," he says. "My mom's been wearing it for years. 
It's easy and it looks sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
If the hair is dry, Beck says, anyone can do a French twist in five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't overdo it, don't overwork it," he says. "That's when you start looking 
like a schoolmarm."

A HEALTHY BACK: WORTH THE WORK; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: STRONG AND FLEXIBLE BACK, LEG AND ABDOMINAL MUSCLES AND GOOD BODY 
MECHANICS ARE THE BEST INSURANCE AGAINST BACK PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Kathleen Ellsworth can't ignore the reminder she always gets when she slacks 
off on exercises for her back, leg and abdominal muscles. 
</P>
<P>
Her back pain returns. 
</P>
<P>
She tires more easily and suffers "all the nagging little symptoms of a bad 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, though, Ellsworth works at being pain free and is successful 
when she does her exercises every day. 
</P>
<P>
Ellsworth, a 41-year-old landscape architect from Costa Mesa, has a herniated 
disc. She learned the conditioning program in a six-week class called The Y's 
Way to a Healthy Back at the Newport-Costa Mesa YMCA. She also swims and 
bicycles to keep in shape. 
</P>
<P>
Ellsworth learned that maintaining a healthy back is hard work, but worth it. 
</P>
<P>
And, she's part of a dramatic change in how back injuries are being treated 
today. The progress of sports medicine has shown the value of certain exercises 
in returning back patients to normal function. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, patients were often told to rest in bed and given passive 
treatments such as massage, hot packs and ultrasound therapy. But treatment 
today often includes exercise to increase strength and flexibility of back, leg 
and abdominal muscles and an education program geared to avoiding re-injury. 
</P>
<P>
The medical community is also sending a message to people who have yet to 
experience back problems: Strong and flexible back, leg and abdominal muscles 
and good body mechanics are the best insurance against back problems. 
</P>
<P>
Many back injuries are self-inflicted by bad habits. Eight out of 10 Americans 
will experience some back pain during their lives. For one out of 10 people, 
back injuries are severe enough to make them miss work. For some, it's 
disabling. 
</P>
<P>
People who have a sedentary job, are more than 20 to 30 pounds overweight, are 
in poor physical condition, lift incorrectly or subject their backs to 
unnecessary strain and twisting are at considerable risk. And weak hamstring 
and abdominal muscles pull a spine out of proper alignment and cannot provide 
sufficient support to the spine. 
</P>
<P>
The main categories of back injuries are lumbar sprain/strains (injuries to 
muscles and ligaments), disc herniations (injury to the fibrocartilage between 
the vertebrae) and fractures (injuries to the spine). 
</P>
<P>
Sprains and strains are believed to represent the vast majority of back 
problems, and computerized equipment is increasingly being used in diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
Most people with back sprain or strain should have rest and medication for two 
or three days and then "need to get into a rehab program of some kind," says 
Dr. Michael Gordon, a Newport Beach orthopedic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
"When we send people to the machine, we know they have lumbar sprains. We just 
have no way of saying how bad it is or how much it interferes with function," 
says Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
Software for the computerized isokinetic equipment, however, shows which muscle 
groups are involved and quantifies the injury by comparing function with people 
of similar weight, height and age. A physician then has a percentile rank for 
that person's function level. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of information we want," Gordon says, to provide a better idea 
of what kind of therapy a person needs and how long rehabilitation might take. 
</P>
<P>
Disc herniations and fractures could potentially require surgery. But only 1% 
of disc problems require surgery, according to Dr. Vert Mooney, a professor of 
orthopedic surgery at UC Irvine. Instead, many patients take the exercise 
therapy and education route. 
</P>
<P>
Muriel Pike, a Costa Mesa preschool director, says moving a heavy table brought 
on excruciating back pain. But she also says years of bending incorrectly and 
lifting children were probably contributing factors. Her condition was 
diagnosed as a deteriorating disc, and she says she felt like "I'm just losing 
it all and I'm going downhill real fast." 
</P>
<P>
By attending Back on Track, a four-week class at Hoag Hospital, Pike, 57, 
learned she could take charge of her back problem. She exercises, walks and 
swims and practices good body mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
She still has a few restrictions and some pain but says, "I'm hoping that I can 
continue to do my exercises and live reasonably well without having to have 
surgery." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Ruzicka, a Newport Beach attorney, is also working hard to avoid surgery. 
He has a protruding disc and took the class at Hoag on the advice of his 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
Ruzicka, 35, found the class helpful and does the exercises he learned every 
day. "I'm still not over the problem, but it's made a lot of headway," he says. 
"At least now I know the proper procedures. I'm not continuing to exacerbate 
the condition. . . . It's slowly improving instead of staying static or getting 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
His motivation? 
</P>
<P>
"Once you go through one of these episodes, you make yourself a sworn oath that 
you won't let it happen again," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Myra Drul, a 23-year-old flight attendant from Santa Ana, did require surgery. 
She says she suffered a herniated disc when she was knocked into a metal post 
and hit by a drink cart when her plane hit some turbulence. But surgical 
removal of the ruined disc and a spinal fusion were only the beginning of her 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
She has put in three months of several hours a day working on her own 
rehabilitation at the Physical Assessment &amp; Reactivation Center and the PAR 
Work Simulation Center, both in Irvine. She is now "feeling 100% better almost" 
and hopes to return to work soon. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a changing concept in what is most appropriate for an injured back," 
says Mooney. Thinking has changed, he says, because studies show "rest is a bad 
thing for connective tissue . . . because the absence of physical stress is 
such a destructive force to the soft tissues that it just causes 
deterioration." Exercise is the only way to build up those muscles and 
ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
The concepts at the PAR Center, part of the new Irvine Medical Center, are an 
extension of sports medicine. The PAR Center treats injuries of the back, neck, 
trunk and extremities. Exercise can reduce inflammation and ease pain because 
it stimulates healing by improving local nutrition to the injured area by the 
exchange of fluids, oxygen and glucose and by removing debris, says Mooney, PAR 
Center medical director. 
</P>
<P>
The strong emphasis is on patients taking an active part in their care, with 
physical therapists acting as coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Back patients at the center go through a rigorous training program, much like 
that of an athlete who is being rehabilitated. The first step is a thorough 
evaluation on computerized equipment, followed by a stabilization program that 
includes McKenzie exercises, which are special exercises to build trunk muscle 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
Stretching and stabilization exercises are followed by manual therapy 
treatments such as postural positioning to control symptoms. Next comes a 
conditioning program on computerized isokinetic equipment that provides 
resistance for more effective conditioning. These machines also measure how a 
patient is progressing. 
</P>
<P>
Patients are also put on a program of exercises to promote a healthy 
cardiorespiratory system to provide good ventilation for proper healing of 
tissue, according to Gary L. Jarvis, vice president of orthopedic services at 
the PAR Center. 
</P>
<P>
The length of time that back patients spend at the center varies, depending on 
the nature of the injury, but Jarvis says the average is about six weeks, which 
costs about $2,100. 
</P>
<P>
And for patients with jobs that might cause further back injury, there's the 
Work Simulation Center, an intensive work-hardening program where patients 
spend several hours a day in tasks that simulate their work environment. They 
learn how to do the task in a way that will protect their backs and condition 
muscles to deal with repetitive tasks. 
</P>
<P>
While poor physical condition is a major factor in back problems, ignorance is 
a close runner-up. Most people simply don't know how to protect their backs. 
</P>
<P>
"We cause our own problems and that's why education is the key to preventing 
unnecessary back problems and often to correcting problems that already exist," 
says Bill Cox, administrative director of Rehabilitation Services at Hoag 
Hospital. Hoag offers the Back on Track classes in addition to individualized 
treatment through Rehabilitation Services and the hospital's Back and Neck 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Cox says with evangelical zeal that people need to understand what they are 
doing in their daily lives that is putting unnecessary stress on back 
structures and causing pain. 
</P>
<P>
The Back on Track series of classes, which costs $160, is geared to do just 
that. For information on the class, call (714) 760-5645. Participants learn 
exercises to increase strength and flexibility, relaxation methods to reduce 
stress, structure and function of the spine, proper posture, techniques for 
using the body efficiently and tips on equipment such as lumbar rolls, 
inflatable pillows and other items that keep the back in proper alignment when 
sitting. 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't somebody tell me this before?" is the reaction of many people when 
they hear how simple protecting their back can be, according to Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Changing bad habits is another goal. Patients often say, "But I've always done 
it that way." Cox responds by saying: "Yes, I know. That's why you have a back 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
People fail to understand that repetitive micro-traumas over a period of time 
can add up to major pain and disability. Just because a movement doesn't cause 
immediate pain, doesn't mean it is not damaging your back, Cox says. Even 
something as simple as doubling over quickly every time you sneeze can cause 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's actually the best for people who don't have an extremely acute 
condition like I have," says Ruzicka of the back school. "If you're just 
starting to get back strain, I think that's when you should go in. If you get 
in there before you really have a chronic condition, it can foreclose ever 
getting in my condition." 
</P>
<P>
Education and exercise are the components of The Y's Way to a Healthy Back, 
which is offered at the Newport-Costa Mesa YMCA, $60 for members and $90 for 
non-members, (714) 642-9990, and the South Coast YMCA, (714) 495-0453, $30 for 
members and $40 for non-members, in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
"We get people in with severe problems looking for an alternative to surgery or 
medicine. We get people in that have very minor back problems that are looking 
for an exercise routine and then we get people that are preventive and want to 
know more about the back," says Diane Berry, physical director at the 
Newport-Costa Mesa Y and instructor for the back class. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe the key to back problems is exercise," Ellsworth says. "If 
you can get on a program and begin to tone up the muscles and keep the body a 
little bit limber and do a variety of activities throughout the day, you can 
pretty well be free of back pain."

CULTURE: NEWPORT HARBOR ART MUSEUM IS MARKED DOWN BECAUSE OF ITS COMMUNITY 
OUTREACH PROGRAM BY THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL GRANT ADVISORY PANEL, WHILE SCR 
IS LAUDED FOR ITS EFFORTS. THE PANEL ALSO RAISED VARIOUS ETHNIC QUESTIONS.

<P>
Orange County's top art museum suffered the largest drop in ranking in the 
state because of its community outreach efforts, a California Arts Council 
grant advisory panel reported this week. 
</P>
<P>
In the same round of sessions, South Coast Repertory theater won the highest 
rating of any arts group in the state for its outreach programs. Two other 
major Orange County arts groups received lower 1990 rankings as well. 
</P>
<P>
The panel cited the Newport Harbor Art Museum's loss of director Kevin Consey, 
chief curator Paul Schimmel and assistant curator Lucinda Barnes in the last 
year in reducing its ranking from a 3+ to a 2 on the panel's 1-to-4 rating 
scale. The rankings delivered this week, formulated by a seven-member panel 
meeting here, will be weighed with rankings for artistic and administrative 
strength for the final scores. 
</P>
<P>
Grant amounts will not be determined until September, when the full council 
acts on the panel's recommendations based on these scores. 
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of good leadership, there is no way we can determine if (any 
outreach efforts) they've outlined will go forward," said Rand Castile, 
director of San Francisco's Asian Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Panelists also criticized lack of ethnic representation on the museum's 
44-member board (which dropped from five minority members to three during the 
past year) and in its paid administrative personnel (from six to zero), and for 
appearing to reach out only to the virtually all-white population of Newport 
Beach, where it is located. 
</P>
<P>
The museum requested state money for its "Partners" program, designed to bring 
art education to schoolchildren, and its "Special Audiences Services 
Initiative," which would improve accessibility for the physically and mentally 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Its application notes that the "Partners" program serves children throughout 
Orange County, and it gives a demographic breakdown of the county's ethnic 
makeup, which it and other sources estimate to be about one-quarter Latino. 
</P>
<P>
But panelists repeatedly cited a key graph in the museum's application stating 
that it "serves the residents and visitors of Newport Beach, whose population 
of 65,000 is reported as 95% white, 3% Hispanic, 1% Asian and less than 1% each 
American Indian, black and other," according to 1980 Census figures. "Within 
this community context, the museum seeks to achieve appropriate diversity of 
the board, staff, programming and audiences," the application said. 
</P>
<P>
Major arts institutions receiving CAC support are expected to act as major 
cultural resources, not just locally but regionally, Darlene Neel, manager of 
Los Angeles' Lewitzky Dance Company, pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"An organization that wants to be recognized as an important regional, indeed 
national institution, (should not) base its activities on a city population," 
Neel said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, said Ray Paredes, UCLA professor of English, "there is nothing in this 
grant proposal that targets multicultural groups, except by inadvertency. (The 
museum has) regressed." 
</P>
<P>
Museum board President Thomas H. Nielsen responded to the panel's criticism 
Thursday, saying that the museum is "attempting to reach and identify people 
with a variety of backgrounds who would be interested in contemporary art." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the museum's curatorial leadership void, Nielsen said: "There is no 
question that not having these key individuals inhibits our ability to do some 
things. But nothing has changed our commitment" to reaching a broad-based 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
The museum, which received a $59,386 grant last year, suffered an equally 
dramatic drop in this category, from a 4- to a 3. Panel comments made earlier 
this summer explaining these scores are not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
While South Coast Repertory's artistic and administrative rank slipped this 
year from 4 to 4-, it fared much better this year on outreach to under-served 
communities, winning the highest score, 4-, among 27 arts groups evaluated 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the council gave the troupe a 3 for outreach and reduced its 
previous grant by nearly 25%, complaining largely about insufficient "ethnic 
diversity" on SCR's board and staff. 
</P>
<P>
This year, SCR increased its number of minority paid administrative personnel 
from two to six and minority trustees from three to six. 
</P>
<P>
But panelists' praise focused mostly on the Tony Award-winning company's 
Hispanic Playwrights Project, which helps young Latino writers get their work 
into mainstream resident theaters and has resulted in three productions on 
SCR's Main Stage in four years. 
</P>
<P>
The Hispanic Playwrights Project "is by far the best program of its type in 
California," said Phil Esparza, producer and administrative director of El 
Teatro Campesino in San Juan Bautista. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine-based Pacific Symphony, which slipped from a 3 to a 3- for outreach, 
nevertheless won praise for its outreach to the local Latino community, 
specifically for its concerts and educational programs, such as those targeting 
Latino youths in Santa Ana schools. Panelists also commended its Hispanic 
Advisory Committee, composed of representatives from various organizations in 
the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
But Paredes doubted the involvement of one group associated with the committee. 
The Santa Ana-based Santiago Club "is primarily a group of Chicano Republicans 
interested in political issues (rather than) outreach and development," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
(John Palacio, assistant to the chairman of the Santiago Club and the 
orchestra's Hispanic program adviser, countered in a phone interview that the 
club is a nonprofit, philanthropic group that donates to projects that 
predominantly serve the Latino community. In the last two years, it has 
contributed about $40,000 in cash and services to the orchestra. Many of its 
members are high-profile Republican politicians, including two Santa Ana City 
Council members, he said. But "people misperceive their individual activities 
with the activities of the club," which is legally barred from engaging in 
political activities.) 
</P>
<P>
While lauding programming that featured Latino compositions, such as the Suite 
from "El Amor Brujo" by Manuel De Falla played at an Hispanic Family Concert 
this year at Santa Ana High School, panelists denounced a program presented in 
December at a seasonal Los Posadas because it included only traditional 
Christmas pop songs such as "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," and "Let It Snow! 
Let It Snow! Let It Snow!" Los Posadas is an annual Christmas event for 
children that is widely celebrated by Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they'd be embarrassed" by that program, Neel said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Symphony executive director Louis G. Spisto, in a phone interview after 
the panel met, said the orchestra based its programming for the Christmas 
concert "on the desires of the Los Posadas Festival committee," which is not 
connected with the orchestra. Spisto added that he wished applicants were 
offered a chance to answer panelists' questions. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how much you write in an application, you can't describe it all," 
Spisto said. 
</P>
<P>
Jan McElwee, director of corporate contributions for Carter Hawley Hale in Los 
Angeles, said that the orchestra's board lacks ethnic diversity. According to 
the Pacific's application, its board includes two Latinos out of 48 total 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra received a CAC grant of $39,319 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Opera Pacific, which received the same ranks this year and last as Pacific 
Symphony, got plaudits for adding an advisory committee of Asian community 
leaders to explore development of an Asian-oriented production by the 
organization's Overture Company. It was also praised for a 20-member group that 
performs works tailored for youth, for its work with "mentally challenged 
students," and received a positive report from a panelist who attended a partly 
bilingual Overture Company performance and workshop for children. 
</P>
<P>
But panelists criticized an illustration promoting the Overture Company's 
production of "Monkey See, Monkey Do," a puppet opera for children, which was 
thought to present a negative view of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
The illustration, which depicts a cross-eyed monkey, his mouth agape, wearing a 
sombrero, "promotes stereotypes of the most demeaning kind," said Castile, who 
also labeled the image "offensive." 
</P>
<P>
Paredes, one of several panelists who said the company should vary its outreach 
programs, said overall that the company's outreach activities "are not notably 
innovative, they are not ambitious . . . very conventional, typical." 
</P>
<P>
Opera Pacific received $41,880 last year.

SPILLED ASPHALT POSES MINIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL PERIL, STATE SAYS

Preliminary state tests released today show that a spill of liquid asphalt into 
a central Orange County flood control channel poses a minimal threat to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
The tests revealed unharmful concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons and a 
number of other toxic substances, said Bruce Paine, an engineering associate 
for the state Regional Water Quality Control Board at Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think there is an imminent threat to the environment," Paine said. 
</P>
<P>
Paine said this morning that crews were working to keep the 10,000 gallons of 
spilled liquid asphalt from breaching a series of earthen dams built to contain 
it in the Santa Ana River flood control channel. The asphalt could contaminate 
the environmentally fragile Bolsa Chica wetlands about four miles downstream 
from the Garden Grove paving firm where the spill originated Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Paine noted that final tests had not yet been completed on any other biological 
threat the spill might pose. Those test results were anticipated later this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The spill now covers a two-mile area of channel between Seal Black Co. Inc. in 
Garden Grove -- where a vandal first turned the asphalt loose -- and Euclid 
Avenue in Santa Ana.

A West German man of Arab origin has been arrested on charges of organizing the 
1986 discotheque bombing that led then-President Ronald Reagan to bomb Libya, 
authorities announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old suspect was seized at his home on a warrant accusing him of 
"preparing and organizing the attack on the La Belle discotheque." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan blamed Libya for the attack, in which two American servicemen and a 
Turkish woman died, and he sent U.S. planes to bomb Tripoli in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
West Berlin Justice Department spokesman Cornel Christoffel said the man, who 
denied involvement in the bombing, was arrested when investigators searched six 
apartments in West Berlin and a cell in the city's Tegel prison. 
</P>
<P>
"The other five suspects are on the run," he added. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people, including many off-duty soldiers, were wounded in the La 
Belle bombing, which U.S. intelligence sources said was ordered by the Libyan 
Embassy in East Berlin.

WEST GERMANY: THE RED ARMY FACTION CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR BOMBING THE CAR OF

A roadside bomb blast triggered by a beam of light injured West Germany's top 
terrorism expert today, and the Red Army Faction terrorist group claimed 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Neusel, the state secretary of the Interior Ministry, escaped with only 
minor injuries, although his car was wrecked. 
</P>
<P>
Neusel, whose ministry is in charge of law enforcement, was taken to a hospital 
but released a short time later and returned to the scene of the bombing, a 
highway on the outskirts of Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
He later told reporters he was happy to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
Today's bombing was the first Red Army Faction attack since eight long-sought 
fugitives -- reputed to be top members of the group -- were captured in East 
Germany in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Army Faction has been responsible for a series of killings and bomb 
attacks in West Germany in the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
The eight reputed members of the group captured in East Germany had been living 
there under assumed names, some for as long as 10 years. Some said they had 
been granted sanctuary by East Germany's former Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials had believed the roundup had put a serious dent in the 
group's ability to carry out attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Today's explosion demolished Neusel's silver BMW sedan, shattering the windows, 
ripping apart the interior, smashing its doors and tearing open the hood and 
the trunk lid. The blast blew a large hole in the highway and damaged the 
guardrail. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Neusel, who was driving the vehicle, probably escaped serious 
injury because the bomb went off on the car's passenger side. He suffered only 
minor cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said the 62-year-old official had no security detail, and 
his car was not equipped with any protective equipment such as armor plating or 
bulletproof glass. West German television said Neusel's driver was on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a letter claiming responsibility in the name of the Red Army 
Faction was found near the site of the attack and that it appeared to be 
genuine.

INDOCHINA: SECRETARY BAKER TELLS ASEAN NATIONS OF A POSSIBLE NEW APPROACH TO

<P>
The United States is considering direct contacts with Cambodia's Communist 
government in addition to Vietnam to try to end the war in Cambodia, Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III said today. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the withdrawal last year of Vietnamese troops backing the Cambodian 
government "gives us cause to see whether Hanoi is now prepared to support a 
process of political reconciliation" that would lead to free elections. 
</P>
<P>
"We are also considering contacts with the Phnom Penh regime," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The moves would fit in both with efforts to reduce East-West tensions and with 
continuing U.S. support for the non-Communist Cambodian rebels, Baker said in a 
speech to the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke on the first day of a three-day meeting of the group, which comprises 
Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Indonesia. The 
foreign ministers of Australia, Canada, the European Community, Japan and New 
Zealand are also attending the session. 
</P>
<P>
ASEAN foreign ministers criticized Baker's announcement last week that the 
United States would not recognize the U.N. delegate from the three-part 
Cambodian resistance because it includes the Communist Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
During Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia in 1975-78, hundreds of thousands of 
Cambodians died from starvation or executions while the government enforced a 
radical program to collectivize agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam invaded in 1978 and toppled the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, but the 
rebels have staged a string of recent battlefield victories and are the 
strongest anti-government force. 
</P>
<P>
Baker assured ASEAN that its goals and those of the United States were not 
contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
"Our common approach to Cambodia has -- for a decade -- focused on three goals: 
a verified withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, the prevention of the return to 
power of the Khmer Rouge, and genuine self-determination for the Cambodian 
people through free elections," he said.

Anis Naccache, convicted of killing two people during a botched assassination

The Justice Ministry said Naccache and four accomplices left France for Iran 
this afternoon after their release was ordered by President Francois 
Mitterrand.

Naccache, whose release had been sought by several hard-line Arab leaders, went 
on a 19-week hunger strike ending in January in a bid to obtain his release. 
</P>
<P>
He and three members of his group were sentenced to life imprisonment for an 
attempt in 1980 to kill Shahpour Bakhtiar, Iran's prime minister before the 
1979 Islamic revolution. A fifth member of the team received a 20-year 
sentence. Bakhtiar escaped injury and still lives in Paris, but a policeman and

Federal officials said today that USX Corp. has agreed to pay $34 million in 
costs and penalties for the cleanup of waste water that was illegally dumped 
from its Gary, Ind., steel mill. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement stems from a 1988 lawsuit filed by the federal government 
alleging that USX exceeded discharge limits in the Grand Calumet River. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleged that the company had made other violations of the federal 
Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the company will pay $1.6 million in penalties and an 
estimated $25 million in cleanup and waste-management measures, officials of 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. attorney's office said at 
a news conference in Chicago, where the lawsuit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
The company also agreed to pay $2.5 million for a study to determine the extent 
of sediment contamination in the Northern Indiana River and another $5 million 
to clean up whatever contamination is found.

MORE OUTPUT, HIGHER PRICES FROM OPEC;

<P>
ENERGY: OIL MINISTERS VOTED TO RAISE THE CARTEL'S PRODUCTION CEILING. THEY ALSO 
SET THE TARGET COST OF A BARREL AT $21.

<P>
OPEC oil ministers reached swift, unanimous agreement today on raising the 
cartel's production ceiling from 22.1 million barrels a day to 22.5 million and 
increasing the target price by $3 a barrel to $21. 
</P>
<P>
"We have finished everything," Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh told 
reporters after a series of intense private talks among the 13 oil ministers at 
their key midyear conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The main issue is that the new reference price is $21 and the ceiling is 
22.491 million barrels a day." 
</P>
<P>
The $21 price is an average of what OPEC members want to be paid for their 
seven principal crude oils. Prices actually paid by the market depend on 
production -- going down if there is cheating on the output quota but rising if 
OPEC members honor their individual agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Aghazadeh said the new production and price levels would remain in force until 
the end of the year and OPEC would set up two groups to "control" production -- 
something the cartel has tried but failed to do in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that if some members are unable to meet their production 
allocations, their quotas will be reduced at OPEC's conference in December, 
while others will then be given higher quotas. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates and officials said a compromise on the $21 base target price was 
reached first by powerful OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iraq and then endorsed 
by the 11 other members. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which also was confirmed by Saudi and Iraq oil ministers, 
emerged in only two days -- an extraordinarily short session by OPEC standards.

Some mail that now gets delivered the next day will take a day longer starting 
this weekend.

Postmaster General Anthony Frank announced he will go ahead with selective 
cutbacks in overnight delivery service, originally announced last January, 
despite opposition from the independent Postal Rate Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, in an opinion issued Thursday, said it opposes the reductions 
nationally, although cutbacks in delivery goals might be justified locally in 
some areas.

A young man who entered into a suicide pact after listening to hours of the 
albums of the rock group Judas Priest believed that the music influenced his 
actions, a psychiatrist testified today. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bruce Tanenbaum said that James Vance "didn't care if he ever got a dime 
from the lawsuit" against Judas Priest and CBS Records. 
</P>
<P>
Vance, who survived for three years after blowing away his face, "felt other 
people needed to be aware of the dangers" of the music, said Tanenbaum as the 
trial ended its second week. 
</P>
<P>
Vance, who was than 20, and his friend Raymond Belknap, then 18, took a shotgun 
after listening to hours of the record "Stained Class," drinking beer and 
smoking marijuana on Dec. 23, 1985. Belknap shot himself and died instantly. 
Vance shot himself, but survived until he died from complications of the wounds 
and prescription drugs in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The families claim that subliminal messages on the record telling the young men 
"Do it" are responsible for the suicide. They are seeking damages that have not 
yet been specified except for the more than $400,000 in medical bills for 
Vance.

PHALLIC SYMBOL ON 'MERMAID'?

A supermarket chain has pulled copies of the animated movie "The Little 
Mermaid" off its shelves because a customer complained that artwork on the 
cover contains an offensive phallic symbol. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the complaint, we've pulled the tape pending investigation," said 
Becca Anderson, a spokeswoman for Bashas' grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
The tape remained off the shelves Thursday and it was uncertain when it would 
return, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was lodged by Michelle Couch of Mesa, who said her husband 
pointed out the offending artwork to her last week. She said she complained to 
Bashas' only after being ignored by Disney. No other stores had removed the 
tape from their shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Couch said on a radio talk show Thursday that "pulling tapes off the shelf is 
not my objective." 
</P>
<P>
What she wanted to accomplish, she said, is to have Disney reprint the labels. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Steele, vice president of publicity for Buena Vista Home Video, a Disney 
subsidiary, said nearly 8 million copies of "The Little Mermaid" have been 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen people have complained about a phallic symbol they believe is 
part of a golden castle drawn on the cover of the videotape, she said. Steele 
said it is not likely that the drawing will be changed. "It's hard to decide if 
12 calls warrant changing the entire artwork, " she said.

CON ARTIST CONVICTED OF TRYING TO BLACKMAIL ANCHORWOMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
A man described as a con artist was convicted of trying to blackmail a local 
anchorwoman by asking for $30,000 to help block the publication of X-rated 
photos of her, which in fact did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court jury deliberated for about four hours before finding Gilbert 
Cabot, 44, guilty Thursday of attempted extortion and conspiracy in connection 
with the plot against KTLA anchorwoman Jann Carl. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel relieved," Carl said. "What he tried to do to me was wrong, and at 
least for a while, or as long as his sentence turns out to be, he won't be able 
to find any more victims." 
</P>
<P>
Cabot faces up to a five-year prison term at his sentencing Sept. 11. Cabot, 
whom prosecutors said is a veteran con artist, had been calling Carl since 1985 
to try to get her to let him act as her manager, Carl said. She repeatedly 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
He then phoned her to say a woman had planned to sell nude photos of the 
anchorwoman taken from a sexually explicit videotape to a national magazine, 
but that he could block the sale by paying the woman $30,000, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Carl, knowing the tape did not exist, worked with authorities on a sting 
operation that resulted in Cabot's arrest.

Carlos Santana, the rock singer-guitarist known for the song "Black Magic

</P>
<P>
"Lately, I've pretty much been getting a fax message from inside my soul that I 
should go South. 
</P>
<P>
The Lord has put my mind in places South -- South Africa, South America, the 
southern United States," he said.

<P>
"That's where people's hearts seem to be the hardest. The Lord wants me to take 
my message of peace and harmony there. I'm going where things most need to be 
plowed." 
</P>
<P>
During his 20-year career, he has recorded 26 albums and has had hit songs such 
as "Evil Ways." His latest album, "Spirits Dancing in the Flesh," contains 
references to spirituality and the emotions of love, joy and peace.

DICKERSON'S BAD-MOUTHING OFFENDS COLTS TACKLE CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Indianapolis Colts tackle Kevin Call finds teammate Eric Dickerson's talk 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson fulfilled his threat to boycott the opening of training camp for 
veterans Thursday at Anderson, Ind. The team is considering a five-day notice 
that could lead to Dickerson's suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Call, for one, wouldn't mind that a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"From the things that he's said, my personal opinion is we don't need him," 
Call said. "After you bad-mouth somebody like that, what are you going to do 
when this guy shows up? How's that going to react with other players." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson has frequently criticized the offensive line, which includes Call, 
saying running behind it is an invitation to injury. 
</P>
<P>
General manager Jim Irsay said Dickerson will be fined $1,500 for each day he 
remains absent. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson has said at various times that he wanted to be traded, planned on 
retiring or wanted a raise above the $1.45 million he's scheduled to receive in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Dallas Cowboys just opened their training camp, Steve Walsh feels 
the competition for the starting quarterback job is already over. 
</P>
<P>
Barring injuries, Troy Aikman seems destined to direct the Cowboys' offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about the season but the job is definitely not up for grabs," 
Walsh said. "And I don't think there are any prospects for me to be traded this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh quarterbacked the Cowboys to their only victory in 1989, a 13-3 upset of 
the Washington Redskins at RFK Stadium. But as soon as Aikman's broken finger 
healed, Walsh was back on the bench watching the majority of the Cowboys' 15 
losses from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh completed 86 of 173 passes for 1,059 yards in five starts, including a 
294-yard performance against Kansas City. However, his five touchdown passes 
were overshadowed by nine interceptions and the 11 times he was sacked. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Dave Krieg has agreed to terms with the Seattle Seahawks and is 
expected to reclaim his starting status. 
</P>
<P>
Krieg, who missed the first eight days of training camp, agreed Thursday to a 
four-year contract with an option for a fifth year, Seahawks President Tom 
Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the contract were not disclosed but Flores said the deal contains 
incentive clauses. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Bengals say they would be interested in signing former 
Philadelphia Eagles tackle Kevin Allen, who served a prison term for sexual 
assault, if the NFL reinstates Allen. 
</P>
<P>
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Thursday that he will decide soon whether 
to reinstate Allen, who was released by the Eagles in 1986 shortly before being 
convicted of a Labor Day sexual assault against a New Jersey woman.

impasse, announced today that they have reached agreement on a state budget for 
the fiscal year that began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The budget includes nearly $800 million in tax and fee increases, contains a 
variety of cuts and curtails some automatic cost-of-living increases, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The $50-billion-plus budget includes an automatic "trigger" sought by 
Deukmejian -- a mechanism that will automatically limit spending each year if 
there is an unexpected decline in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The state has gone nearly a month into the new fiscal year without a budget, 
the longest period in the state's history without a spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
The hangup was caused by lawmakers' inability to agree on how best to cover a 
$3.6 billion revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we've got this proposal to present to the legislators. Hopefully, they 
will pass it as quickly as possible," Deukmejian said. But, he added, "it's 
always hard to get a two-thirds vote (in the Legislature)."
