OUTTAKES: 'THE TWO JAKES' -- IT'S ALL JAKE NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

After 16 years, one false start, a couple of shattered friendships, a rewritten 
script, a new ending and enough other rumors to keep a private eye busy 
full-time, Paramount Pictures' sequel to "Chinatown" is about to open. But with 
less than two weeks to its Aug. 10 release date, director-star and Jake Gittes 
alter-ego Jack Nicholson has been back in the studio recording eight pages of 
narrative dialogue for "The Two Jakes." 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to have a whack at (a narration)," Nicholson tells us. "It's 
the toughest piece of writing I've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
Like "Chinatown," "The Two Jakes" is complicated: set in 1948, 11 years after 
the events of "Chinatown," it has Jake embroiled in a murder case that both 
links the sequel to the original film and pivots on a complex scam to rip off 
oil beneath the L.A. basin. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't put (narration) there to explain the story," Nicholson says, "but to 
give audiences a point of reference. This is not a popcorn movie; audiences are 
going to have to work for it and we wanted to let them know that it's all 
right, they're going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson admits that adding narration to the already thickly woven Robert 
Towne script made him nervous. So Nicholson invited his "idol," Billy Wilder -- 
the king of film noir narration ("Double Indemnity," "Sunset Boulevard") -- to 
a screening of the narrated version "to see if he thought narration helped or 
hurt the picture." 
</P>
<P>
"Two good lines of narration can save you a half-hour of a boring picture," 
says Wilder, who gives Nicholson's "Two Jakes" narration a thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very cerebral picture, it's way above the usual 'Die Hard' level," 
Wilder says. "(Nicholson) asked me should he have the narration or not. I 
thought he should. I thought it was excellent." Jack Mathews

DROPPING ANCHOR AT BAYSIDE 240; 
</P>
<P>
CAN A RESTAURANT WITH A VIEW MAKE GOOD WITH SERIOUS FOOD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
What have we here? A clever display of seafood on ice: It looks like a baby 
shark thrashing the heck out of a mackerel for an audience of littleneck clams. 
Nice work, boys -- leave your cards, we'll drop a word to "Saturday Night's 
Main Event." 
</P>
<P>
And what have we here? Behind the still life of wrestling seafood is a big 
gleaming display kitchen. At the tables (somewhat disturbing tables of blond 
wood that seem to slope downward toward all four 
</P>
<P>
edges) you're handed a sophisticated California wine list. And Bayside 240's 
menu, which changes slightly every day, is full of suavely up-to-date fancies 
like grilled orange roughy with artichoke puree and crispy lamb chops with 
thyme sauce. 
</P>
<P>
It's a menu that has "Culinary Institute of America graduate" written all over 
it, and Chef Thomas Tompkins did indeed attend that East Coast hotbed of 
avant-gardism. He plans to have winemaker dinners and so on. It sounds like 
serious restaurant time. 
</P>
<P>
And yet there's all that view out the huge windows: 180 degrees of ocean 
(counting what you can see from the busy, beachy bar as well as the restaurant 
side's view), not to mention the vast panorama of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
Crane your neck and look east a little -- more or less back the way you drove, 
because Bayside 240 is toward the end of San Pedro Pier -- and you can see a 
couple of other restaurants getting along without quite such gorgeous view 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
The others are all chain restaurants, and that's what's amazing about Bayside 
240. It has certifiably noble ambitions as a restaurant even though it could 
clearly get people out here to romantic view headquarters, as the chain 
restaurants do, serving food not much above the familiar surf and/or turf 
level. It works hard in the kitchen where the colorful, cartoony 30-foot mural 
or the driftwood dragon hanging over the bar might be be enough to augment the 
attraction of the view. 
</P>
<P>
Tompkins' menu is actually semi-familiar, or rather sometimes familiar. A lot 
of dishes sound Italian, regional American or possibly Chinese or Mexican, 
apart from the ones that suggest the avant-garde. But names can deceive. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the salmon pizza is less exotic than you'd think. It's 
essentially Wolfgang Puck's "Jewish pizza" -- not on the Spago menu but often 
available there. This sort of "pizza" is served cold, covered with salmon and 
cream cheese, making it more or less a flattened-out version of lox and bagels. 
Or as it has been put, "at last a bagel with lox that's big enough." 
</P>
<P>
The egg rolls are cousins to the pizza, scarcely Oriental items lavishly filled 
with lobster and cream cheese, though the vegetable rolls with charred ahi turn 
out to be sushi-like. The big, meaty crab cakes, on the other hand, are exactly 
as they sound, rather soft and rich, and very appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Soups do not seem to be a strong suit at Bayside 240. The seafood gumbo, in 
particular, is very strange, but not for the usual reasons. The Louisiana-style 
roux that is the basis of gumbo is not undercooked, as California chefs are 
likely to make it; on the contrary, the flour has been fried so dark you can't 
taste anything but what seems the aftermath of a kitchen fire. Without looking, 
I'd never have guessed there were shrimp in this. 
</P>
<P>
The entrees are nearly all seafood, and of somewhat more even quality than the 
appetizers. The hot-smoked king salmon might be the best of them. It's 
extremely smoky, and the mawkish tendencies of salmon when served hot are cut 
by both the smokiness and the fresh-tasting, mildly sweet-and-sour sauce of 
tomatillos, fried onions and honey. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican mahi-mahi (a name to ponder) could hardly miss, baked in a tangy 
coat of Parmesan and Romano cheeses, nor could the luscious Molokai channel 
swordfish with its garnish of corn relish. Cajun red snapper (sometimes made 
with other fish such as black bass) is not exactly right out of the bayous, but 
it's well grilled and comes with a novel jalapeno linguine in which the bite of 
hot pepper is just discernible. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo stew is the obligatory huge bowl of seafood (approximately two each of 
shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops, crab claws and fish chunks). I can detect the 
garlic and maybe a little saffron in the garlic saffron tomato sauce, but 
there's no doubt at all about the tomatoes. There are plenty of really fresh 
tomatoes in this one. Sometimes there is a dish of soft-shell clams (thin-shell 
would be a better name; you wouldn't want to eat these whole like a soft-shell 
crab) that come in a thin broth intriguingly spiced with clove. 
</P>
<P>
Petrale sole gets treated very gently -- perhaps a shade too gently, though the 
dish is probably just the thing for light diners. In the center of the plate 
lies a big curled lump of sole surrounded by a dainty broth flavored with a bit 
of olive oil. The northwest sector is a Tic-Tac-Toe pattern of crunchy, barely 
cooked baby asparagus and poached red and yellow cherry tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawaiian ono with orange butter sauce is essentially for fans of Polynesian 
Cuisine. The fish is served scattered with chives on a riot of pineapple and 
orange slices, with a sunny smear of sweet orange-flavored sauce peeping out 
from among the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
You have to remember that everything is a la carte. If you want a green salad, 
it's on the list of side dishes; a nice one of pretty baby lettuces and some 
peeled tomatoes. There are also old-fashioned scalloped potatoes and 
particularly good French fries. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts at Bayside 240 rarely aim at subtlety (the white chocolate 
cheesecake is an exception, smooth and scarcely sweet). There's a chocolate 
fudge cake with a strong bitter chocolate flavor, and a banana extravagance 
called banana savannah, a sort of banana pie with a chocolate layer. 
</P>
<P>
The most imposing unsubtle dessert is a sort of giant sundae called the 
thrasher, which recalls the glory days of the soda fountain. It's a brownie 
topped with vanilla ice cream and surrounded on various sides with banana and 
pineapple slices, whipped cream and hot fudge sauce. I wouldn't swear there 
weren't nuts on it as well. 
</P>
<P>
The menu sensibly recommends the thrasher for two people. One person could get 
thoroughly thrashed by it. Perhaps that still life by the door, the one of the 
shark whipping a smaller fish, is a warning.

NOTEBOOK: PACIFIC DINING CAR LAYS TRACKS FOR COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pacific Dining Car, the 69-year-old classic steakhouse at the edge of 
downtown Los Angeles, is building a spur line out west. 
</P>
<P>
"We've purchased the business that was Jack's at the Beach in Santa Monica," 
said Dining Car manager Mike Green. "We're completely remodeling it, to the 
extent that nothing will remain of Jack's, and we plan to open in approximately 
late September." 
</P>
<P>
The new place will also be called Pacific Dining Car, and it will offer the 
same menu and the same wine list (which has always been a good, big one, 
offering some real bargains). "We're training the staff right now at the 
downtown location," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the original Dining Car is open 24 hours a day, the new one will start 
off by serving lunch on weekdays only and dinner until 2 a.m. seven nights a 
week. "We might do the 24-hour thing eventually," Green said. "In fact we kind 
of hope to, but we haven't discussed it yet with any of the powers that be in 
Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether there isn't a danger that Santa Monica is already 
overcrowded with upscale restaurants, Green replied, "We like to think that 
we'll kind of fill a niche that exists in that area, with a place that's sort 
of plush but comfortable -- the way we feel that, say, DC 3 is. We're not 
copying the original Dining Car, but we're trying to get the same feel. We 
really are convinced that there's nobody else out there that offers what we 
have to offer." 
</P>
<P>
RESTAURANT MISCELLANY: Rumors to the contrary, the original Fragrant Vegetable 
in Monterey Park has not gone out of business. It closed briefly for kitchen 
renovation, but is now open again, with the same owner and menu. . . . And 
Lunaria in West L.A. offers a 45-minute, $8-per-person salad-and-pasta lunch, 
served at the bar, Tuesday through Friday. Valet parking validation is 
included. The same restaurant has also instituted a complimentary shuttle 
service to and from Century City, available to parties of four or more on a 
first-come, first-served basis.WHAT'S NEW: Former L.A. radio celebrity Roger 
Barkley has opened the Barkley Restaurant &amp; Bar in La Canada Flintridge, in 
partnership with his wife, Nila, and associate Jim Campbell. . . . Mon Kee, the 
noted Hong Kong-style seafood restaurant downtown -- which had earlier opened 
and then closed an offshoot restaurant in Beverly Hills -- is trying again, 
this time in Encino, with a new 200-seat restaurant on Ventura Boulevard. . . . 
James (Gustavo) Li of Cafe Connection in Beverly Hills has opened the Rio Bar 
&amp; Grill downtown, on the site of the former Webster's in the Embassy Hotel 
(an establishment which, architecture trivia buffs might note, was designed -- 
or rather redesigned -- by the estimable Charles Moore). Chef at the new 
restaurant, which will feature "contemporary, Continental, and Brazilian food," 
is Michel Wahaltere, ex-chef at Chapo on Melrose. . . . And the Clay Pit of 
Redondo Beach, which features tandoori-cooked breads, meats, fowl and fish, has 
opened a second location, at Chapman Market near downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S ON: Today, the restaurants Caffe Angeli, Pazzia, Trumps, Mario's, the 
Authentic Cafe, Cafe L.A., and the Wonderful Parties/Wonderful Foods catering 
company will provide edibles for Fantastica 90, described as "an afternoon 
stroll through West Hollywood's art galleries, designer showrooms, and antique 
shops." The event, benefiting Friends of the Los Angeles Free Clinic, kicks off 
with a brunch at Trumps at 10:30 a.m. at $45 a head. Registration for the 
stroll, which lasts from noon to 5 p.m., is at the Pacific Design Center, and 
tickets are $25. Information: (213) 653-0440. . . . Also today, Caffe Giuseppe 
in Northridge serves a six-course garlic dinner for $30 per person -- finishing 
with fresh berries with zabaglione, the latter offered both with and without 
garlic!. . . . St. Moritz in Studio City observes Swiss Independence Day on 
Wednesday with a three-course, $18-per-person menu featuring traditional Swiss 
dishes. . . . The Torrance Area Chamber of Commerce holds its annual Torrance 
Wine Festival Saturday from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. on the grounds of American Honda 
Motor Co. in Torrance. Tickets to the event, which will feature foods from 30 
South Bay restaurants and wines from 40 California producers, are $30 each in 
advance or $35 at the door -- with proceeds going to the South Bay Children's 
Health Center. . . . Saturday is also the first day of UCLA Extension's "Inside 
Los Angeles Restaurants" class for this year. Cookbook author Naomi Shuwarger 
will take students through the kitchens of Champagne, the Eureka Brewing Co. 
and Bice on three consecutive Saturdays, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Fee for all 
three classes is $175. . . . From Saturday through Aug. 17, I Cugini in Santa 
Monica will hold a "Festa di Famiglia" or family fair, featuring an Italian 
family recipe contest, strolling musicians and other entertainers, and special 
family-style dishes. . . . The Eclectic Palate food and wine society hosts a 
five-course dinner accompanied by a selection of Krug champagnes at La Toque, 
Aug. 6. Cost is $85 per person. Call (213) 858-7424 for details. . . . And the 
Fifth Annual "Seagram's Taste of L.A." food festival is scheduled for Aug. 11, 
12, 18 and 19, from noon to 11 p.m., at the Santa Monica Civic Center. The 
event will feature the wares of approximately 50 L.A. area restaurants as well 
as Seagram's cocktails, Taittinger champagne, and other beverages offered at $1 
to $5 per portion. Admission is $8 for adults, $6 for senior citizens, $4 for 
children, and a portion of the profits will be given to the Greater Los Angeles 
Partnership for the Homeless, the Ocean Park Community Center, and the St. 
Joseph Center.

PLACING THE BLAME FOR THE CONDITION OF ROCK 'N' ROLL

<TEXT>
<P>
The real downslide first appears in the '70s when there was no clear-cut, bona 
fide phenomenon for that decade along the lines of Elvis or the Beatles (Elton 
John came close, but nowhere close enough). 
</P>
<P>
The '80s were further confounded by several acts vying for this position -- 
Jackson, Springsteen, Prince, etc. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no real need to worry. Because of rock's historical impact, 
whatever replaces it would have to transcend it and be more exciting in the 
eyes of adolescents. Side genres such as rap, disco or techno-pop are not 
strong enough to override it. They've just bought rock 'n' roll more time.

Re the July 22 article on "outing" by Pat H. Broeske and John M. Wilson: 
Tattle-taling on closeted homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
Yes! Just of kind of juicy smut I savor. 
</P>
<P>
You tantalize with tidbits: ". . . the alleged lesbianism of the daughter of a 
popular performer," a former model who ". . . claimed she had a relationship 
with a prominent TV and film actress." Yes! Yes! Don't stop! 
</P>
<P>
The excitement is building. The breath is faster. I turn the pages quickly. 
Pressure is mounting. Who? I want names, dammit! and then . . . there it is 
that little box that marks the article's end, like an inept lover who 
prematurely rolls over. It'll be another long night.

Calendar received nearly 40 letters on Robert Hilburn's July 15 cover story, 
"Is Rock Running on Empty?" Here are seven in addition to the dozen published 
July 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaming rock's bankruptcy of originality on radio programmers and a complacent 
audience missed the mark like a Gerald Ford golf shot. 
</P>
<P>
The blame rests on the record companies and their A&amp;R people. 
</P>
<P>
These "fat cats" have ridden the crest of rock's monetary success for years by 
perpetuating clones of the latest fad. As soon as a label comes out with a new 
artist, every other label's A&amp;R robots go out and sign a similar act in an 
effort to stay "current." No wonder the poor radio programmers have changed FM 
radio from what once was a mecca of musical originality into a Top 20 joke! And 
as for MTV programming, ditto!

What we as gay people are fighting is invisibility. Recently, ABC bowed to 
pressure from its sponsors (including Pillsbury and Toys 'R' Us) and will not 
rerun the episode of "thirtysomething" that includes a humanly dimensioned gay 
character. 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of attempt at rendering us invisible that created a need for 
outing in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, perhaps just getting people to recognize that a lot of the people 
around them, including their movie, TV and sports idols might be gay will help 
to break down prejudices and we can all get on with the important things, like 
fighting AIDS instead of each other.

Q: I have an adjustable-rate mortgage that is now at about 10.25%. Under the 
terms of the mortgage, the rate can rise as high as 12.75%. Given the recent 
drop in fixed-rate mortgages to the 10% range, does it make sense for me to 
refinance now? If not, when would it? Or am I stuck forever with this 
adjustable rate? I owe about $245,000 and have about 27 years left on the loan. 
-- A.R. 
</P>
<P>
A: Whether you -- or any home owner -- should consider refinancing a mortgage 
depends on a variety of factors, including the reasons for the refinance and 
how long you plan to own the house. 
</P>
<P>
If your goal is to save money on your monthly mortgage payments, as yours 
apparently is, our lending experts say rates must drop a minimum of two points 
below what you are currently paying, and you must continue to own your home for 
at least another three years after the refinancing to begin reaping the 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, a refinancing will cost you about $1,700 in fees plus about another 
2 points, the equivalent of 2% of the amount refinanced. In your case that 
would amount to about $6,600. (By the way, because your loan balance is above 
$187,450, it is considered a "jumbo" loan, and you can expect any new mortgage 
rate to be about 0.5% higher than your institution charges smaller borrowers.) 
</P>
<P>
However, if your motive is to consolidate outstanding mortgages or pay off a 
looming balloon loan, refinancing can be appropriate. Often your present lender 
and title insurance company can offer you the best rates, but don't stop there. 
A thorough search frequently can result in more favorable rates and charges. 
</P>
<P>
If your motive for refinancing is to cash in on some of the equity you have 
accumulated in your house, our experts suggest that you consider a home-equity 
loan instead because fees are typically lower. It is also better suited to 
homeowners who plan to sell within the next few years.

Owning Share in Office Building May Be Risky 
</P>
<P>
Q: My friend owns an entire office building with seven office spaces. He sold 
me an undivided one-seventh interest in it and designated one office space for 
my medical practice. I pay one-seventh of the insurance, property taxes, 
grounds maintenance and other operating costs of the building. Am I responsible 
for any loss of income or the cost of repairs he incurs on the remaining 
six-sevenths of the building? This is not a partnership or condominium. He just 
sold me a one-seventh undivided interest in the building. What is my situation? 
-- S.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: According to Daniel McIntosh of the Century City law firm of Seyfarth Shaw 
Fairweather &amp; Geraldson, although you may think that you purchased a single 
office and are responsible only for the cost of maintaining that office, if you 
have an undivided one-seventh interest in the building, you most likely have a 
co-tenancy ownership interest. In this case you are generally liable for your 
pro rata share of the entire building expenses, including the costs of repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Even though you may not be directly liable for paying the mortgage, if the 
building secures the mortgage on it, your interest in the property could be 
lost if the mortgage is not paid. If you had to begin paying the mortgage to 
protect the property from foreclosure, you would be entitled to a lien on your 
friend's interest in the building to the extent of the amount you paid. You 
could also be required to pay more than your pro rata share of the property 
taxes in order to protect the building from county authorities. In this event, 
you would also have the right to repayment from your friend. 
</P>
<P>
McIntosh recommends that you obtain a title report on the building to determine 
the manner in which ownership of the building is shared by you and your friend. 
This report can also tell you whether there are any other co-tenants. Take the 
report to an attorney and find out what your rights and liabilities are and 
whether they are consistent with what your friend told you. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Deducting Interest on a 401(k) Loan 
</P>
<P>
Q: I participate in a 401(k) plan at work and borrowed against my balance 
earlier this year. I plan to repay the loan within the next three years. 
Meanwhile, how do I handle the interest portion of the payments on my tax 
returns? I am repaying the loan -- principal plus interest -- with "after tax" 
money. But will I be taxed again on the interest portion of the payment when 
the funds are finally withdrawn from the account upon my retirement? -- H.K. 
</P>
<P>
A: There may be a simple way to handle the interest on the loan repayment, and 
it could settle the matter for the present -- and years from now when you 
finally distribute your 401(k) account. Deduct the interest you are paying on 
the loan from your taxes throughout the loan's three-year duration. 
</P>
<P>
However, first you must determine if you are eligible for the deduction. You 
are not eligible if you are designated a "key employee" of your company in its 
401(k) plan. If you're not a key employee and if you are borrowing against 
401(k) pretax contributions that you voluntarily made, you are not entitled to 
deduct the interest on any loan. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is the issue of how you used the loan proceeds. If your use 
qualifies as deductible interest -- home purchase, home improvement, investment 
and business are the four major categories -- then you are free to take the 
deduction up to the legal limits. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't pass all of these tests, the interest you are paying on your loan 
will be made with after-tax dollars and your withdrawals from the account will 
be taxed again upon your retirement. 
</P>
<P>
There are limits to how much you can borrow against your 401(k) account before 
the loan is considered a taxable distribution. In general, the IRS lets you 
borrow 50% of the account balance, to a maximum of $50,000. If your account is 
small, you can borrow up to 100% of it, to a maximum of $10,000. And unless the 
loan was taken out to purchase a home, it must be repaid within five years.

Q: Despite the relatively difficult borrowing environment, I think that the UAL 
Corp. buyout by its unions has a 70-30 chance of succeeding. What odds would 
you lay? -- Goleta, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
A: I would guess that there is only a 30% chance that this deal will ever be 
completed. Sources I have who are close to foreign banks have been telling me 
for months that the Japanese were very embarrassed by the failure of the UAL 
deal to materialize last October, and that they are now extremely reluctant to 
go along with these new plans. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there also have been a lot of changes in the international situation 
since last October. The political events in Eastern Europe have given bankers 
plenty of opportunities to invest their money without getting involved in iffy 
deals in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, the rising level of bad real estate loans in the United States is 
making our bankers very skittish. And I don't think that they are dying to 
invest in UAL, which could easily turn into a chaotic situation with unions 
fighting unions. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, there are a myriad of other problems inherent in the airline 
business that could worry the banks. Will fuel prices remain as favorable as 
they are now through the life of the UAL transaction? Will the opening of new 
air routes to Japan hurt UAL's business? Can Gerald Greenwald, the former vice 
chairman of Chrysler Corp. and a stranger to the airline business, work some 
magic in his new job as head of UAL? 
</P>
<P>
And remember, there is no investor putting up any of his hard-earned money in 
this deal. All the unions are doing is granting wage concessions of about $2 
billion over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
I think that the banks ultimately will say: "There are easier ways to earn a 
buck." 
</P>
<P>
But my opinion is not a universal one. I recently spoke with the head of one of 
the United States' other big airlines, and I happened to ask his opinion on the 
chances of the UAL deal going through. He said he believed that the UAL deal 
was a cinch. As long as the bankers get assurances from the unions that workers 
are willing to take additional wage cuts -- if necessary -- to make the deal 
work, the banks have nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the same risks I mentioned above, plus the death of the junk bond 
market, the highly rated arbitrage department at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. recently 
told clients that there was only a 50-50 chance that the UAL deal will be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm interested in investing in the stock market using no-load mutual funds. 
Is there a publication on the subject? I'd prefer one that gives a list of the 
best-performing no-load mutual funds and how to contact them. -- St. Louis 
</P>
<P>
A: There are plenty of publications that keep track of the performance of 
no-load mutual funds and give addresses and phone numbers for the funds' 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
One is the "Mutual Fund Sourcebook," published by Morningstar Inc., 53 West 
Jackson St., Suite 460, Chicago, Ill. 60604. The encyclopedic soft-cover book 
categorizes the funds according to their risks, lists the funds' portfolios, 
gives investment criteria and performance. The cost is $60. 
</P>
<P>
Another is "The Handbook for No-Load Fund Investors," published by the No-Load 
Fund Investor, P.O. Box 283, Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. 10706. It costs $42 and 
contains the performance records and other information on 1,200 no-load and 
low-load mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating service, and Lipper Analytical Services, a 
research firm, put out something called "Mutual Fund Profiles" that costs $117 
and contains reviews of the 1,000 largest stock and bond funds -- both load 
funds and those that charge no fees. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I purchased 100 shares of General Motors stock in the early 1980s. But my 
brokerage firm went out of business, and it said all the cash and stock in my 
account was being mailed to me. 
</P>
<P>
I received that letter, which was sent on March 15, 1989. But in February, 
1989, GM had declared a 2-for-1 stock split. I never received the additional 
100 shares, and I haven't been receiving any of the dividends on those shares. 
</P>
<P>
I am nearing retirement and would like to locate this 100-share certificate and 
the dividends that I haven't received for a year. Is there any way you can cut 
through the red tape to help me? -- Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
A: The red tape has been cut. 
</P>
<P>
First Chicago Corp., the transfer agent for the stock, will reissue the 
dividend checks and will send you an affidavit of loss for the certificate for 
the 100 shares. You won't have to post an indemnity bond to get the new 
certificate; it will be sent to you promptly. 
</P>
<P>
The folks over at GM were very helpful in resolving your problem. Other readers 
should take note that the investment relations department of most major 
companies can help resolve stockholder problems like this one. 
</P>
<P>
According to GM, here's what happened in your case: The certificate for the 100 
post-split shares was sent to you in early 1989, and all the dividend checks 
have followed. But it appears that when your account was transferred from the 
defunct broker to discount broker Charles Schwab, your name and address were 
registered incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
Confusing the situation even more was the fact that your Social Security number 
isn't the same as your taxpayer identification number, which GM says is unusual 
for an individual investor. So when the transfer agent punched your Social 
Security number into the computer, you didn't show up as a shareholder in GM. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the problem has been resolved, and you can now retire in peace. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I found two shares of White Eagle International Inc. stock in my husband's 
papers after he died. I'm sure it is worthless, but I'd like to know for sure. 
-- Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your instinct is good. According to R. M. Smythe &amp; Co., which 
specializes in tracking down long-lost stocks, White Eagle had its charter 
cancelled in 1983. The stock is worthless. JOHN CRUDELE

MARKETS / JOHN CRUDELE: TRADERS' SETBACK MAY PORTEND A SLIDE IN STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post.

<TEXT>
<P>
The stock cartel is dying. And if the cartel dies, some experts think that it 
could take the stock market with it. 
</P>
<P>
That's the easiest way to sum up how some see the volatile events of the past 
week in the equities market. At approximately 3:15 p.m. on Friday, July 20, 
traders in stock index futures and their cartel cousins, the program traders, 
lost control of the stock market that they had been manipulating skillfully 
upward for many months. 
</P>
<P>
The result -- the biggest and most frightening drop for the Dow Jones 
industrial average in many months -- shocked the average investor. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear by the middle of July that a significant shift was occurring in 
Wall Street's attitude toward stocks. Fundamentals -- such as rising interest 
rates overseas, the slowing U.S. economy, the savings and loan mess, and the 
stalemate on federal deficit-reduction talks -- were once again important to 
the stock market. These factors had been ignored for months, as Wall Street 
traders became fascinated by the Dow's ability to rise in spite of all the bad 
things that were happening. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, of course, would agree that professional traders can control the 
direction of the market. But in recent months, more and more experts have been 
arguing that the influence of investment firms and their major clients who 
trade stock index futures contracts has risen as the average investor conceded 
control over the market. 
</P>
<P>
And many professional traders seem to have become believers in what could be 
called the "Myth of the Dow," which states that, even in an economic recession, 
it is safe to own blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
A footnote to that myth is that even if blue-chip companies did get hurt by a 
downturn in the economy (a fact that many believers aren't even willing to 
concede), the clique of program traders and stock index futures jockeys (the 
cartel, for short) would still be able to keep this small group of stocks from 
tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
The belief in the ability of the program and stock index futures traders to 
keep shares prices buoyant was dealt a severe blow that Friday. At the 
beginning of the day's final hour, bullishness was rampant. Stocks were 
supposed to go up in price, and the Dow was supposed to finally break through 
the elusive 3,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Even the New York Stock Exchange reported publicly that there were many more 
"buy" orders for stocks in the last minutes before the expiration of the July 
stock index futures and options contracts than there were sell orders. 
</P>
<P>
But then something happened. The "buy" orders, which had produced a positive 
imbalance for the market just minutes before, were suddenly withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
One explanation for the reversal was that very poor earnings reported by Texas 
Instruments, the electronics company, had produced a quick change in sentiment. 
But there was also talk around the stock index futures market that someone had 
pulled a fast one. 
</P>
<P>
The "buy" orders being reported to the NYSE, the gossip went, were intended to 
be a trap. While the majority of the cartel's traders would be anticipating a 
run-up in stock prices, the traitor in the group knew that wouldn't happen 
because the buy orders were bogus. That sort of shenanigan would be enough to 
sink any cartel. 
</P>
<P>
But don't go burying the cartel quite yet. The ability of the Dow -- taking its 
cue from stock index futures traders -- to recover half of its 105-point 
decline by the end of trading last Monday will, undoubtably, allow the belief 
in the cartel's invincibility to linger. 
</P>
<P>
But the change from a trader-driven stock market to a market driven by 
fundamentals would seem to be irreversible. And if the economy continues to 
weaken, that means that stock prices are likely to decline a whole lot more in 
the face of economic reality. 
</P>
<P>
One shot of reality was delivered last week by the Treasury Department, which 
reported that the United States had a budget deficit of $11.2 billion in June, 
a month in which there is ordinarily a surplus. In June of 1989, for instance, 
the surplus came to $7.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Reality also took the form of an increase in interest rates over the past week 
in Japan, where inflation and an over-robust economy are problematic. 
</P>
<P>
What that means is that the United States will have a very difficult time 
getting its own interest rates down. And that hurts the chances of an immediate 
pickup in the faltering American economy. 
</P>
<P>
Even the pessimists on Wall Street don't believe that the stock market is 
getting set for a big crash -- at least not at the moment. There was a general 
belief last week that stock prices would be able to rally one more time before 
getting clobbered for good. 
</P>
<P>
When will Wall Street face its next crisis? Perhaps between Aug. 7 and 9, when 
the U.S. Treasury will probably have to sell another record amount of bonds. 
This could put more upward pressure on domestic interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Consensus on What Oil Stocks Will Do 
</P>
<P>
Even as the bulk of the stock market has been cooling off these past few weeks, 
oil stocks have been burning. And that is a curious development, considering 
that the price of oil is still considerably below what it was just five months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is simple: Some important OPEC nations -- including the 
ever-unpredictable Iraq -- seem serious this time about enforcing production 
quotas. But haven't we heard that before? What if someone decides to 
overproduce oil and drive down the price? Who's going to stop them? 
</P>
<P>
As always, Saudi Arabia holds the key, energy experts say. But there is still a 
question on Wall Street as to whether the Middle East's largest oil producer is 
willing to stand up to overproducers. If it doesn't, oil costs will continue to 
remain depressed, and the price of energy shares should dip. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Frank Knuettel, for one, is betting that 
both oil prices and the price of energy stocks will be rising. He told clients 
recently that oil could be $1.50 a barrel higher in the next few weeks. Oil 
could, says Knuettel, climb even higher in the fourth quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Knuettel is telling clients to keep the faith. Hold onto those oil stocks for a 
while longer. 
</P>
<P>
But there is disagreement. Alan Gaines of Gaines Berland Inc. predicts that the 
price of crude will rise only about half as much as inflation. So Gaines, who 
specializes in oil shares, isn't buying any stock in oil companies or 
oil-service companies. 
</P>
<P>
But Gaines does like the shares of American oil refiners, because rising demand 
for gasoline will make the limited number of refining facilities in this 
country more valuable and profitable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is U.S. Liquidity Really Drying Up? 
</P>
<P>
The liquidity indicator within the U.S. money supply recorded its slimmest gain 
ever in May, and that weak performance is sparking a debate among experts as to 
whether the gauge is, or isn't, issuing a warning that bad things are ahead for 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
While most people have learned to watch growth in the M1 money supply (checking 
accounts, currency, etc.), M2 or M3 indicators, some experts these days are 
staring at a figure that the Federal Reserve Board simply calls "L" for 
liquidity. 
</P>
<P>
L rose only 2.5% in May compared to the year-previous level. Prior to that, the 
worst year-to-year monthly growth was 2.7%. And the liquidity indicator fell in 
May to $4.88 trillion from $4.91 trillion in April. 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that, ordinarily, slow growth in this liquidity indicator means 
that the nation's economy will weaken within the next few months. And a decline 
in L of the magnitude experienced between April and May would be an even worse 
omen for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
But the thing that has the pros arguing this time around is whether the 
sluggishness of L is showing up mainly because assets are being shifted around 
as a result of the savings and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a trend that bears watching, but I don't think the shrinkage in L 
portends anything of grave consequence for the economy at this point," says 
William Sullivan, Fed watcher at Dean Witter Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
The M2 measurement generally consists of overnight repurchase agreements, money 
market mutual funds held by individuals, and various types of savings deposits. 
M3 includes all of M2, plus large certificates of deposit, money market funds 
held by institutional investors, term repurchase agreements and term Eurodollar 
deposits. L includes all of M3, plus savings bonds, Treasury bills, and coupons 
of 12-month maturities or less, bankers acceptances and short-term paper. 
</P>
<P>
The experts who aren't worried about the level of liquidity say that, with the 
closing of so many S&amp;Ls, jumbo CDs are apparently being rechanneled either 
into money market mutual funds (included in M2), the stock market, the bond 
market or into an account of the Resolution Trust Company. 
</P>
<P>
Money being taken over by the RTC as part of its absorption of a thrift, or 
being put into stocks and bonds, would simply not register in any Fed 
measurements. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, says this group of experts, this money would seem to simply disappear 
from the system. And it could leave the impression that liquidity in the 
monetary system was drying up. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees that the slowdown in liquidity is benign. 
</P>
<P>
"The S&amp;L crisis is part of it," says John Williams, an economist with 
American Business Econometrics Inc. in Ridgewood, N.J. "But there is more to it 
than that. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan would not have lowered interest rates to 
avert a credit crunch," claims Williams, if he weren't concerned about 
illiquidity in the monetary system.

<P>
By all reasonable measures, Coke's experience in Japan has been a happy one. 
Coca-Cola Co. has 70% of the Japanese market for soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, however, the path it took to "insiderization" -- 
replicating a home-country business system in a new national market -- creates 
many more problems than it solves. 
</P>
<P>
Managers back at headquarters, experienced in only one way to succeed, are 
inclined to force that model on each new opportunity that arises. Sometimes it 
will be the right answer; but chances are that the home-country reflex, the 
impulse to generalize globally from a sample of one, will lead efforts astray. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan's pharmaceutical industry, for example, Coke's approach would not 
work. Foreign entrants simply have to find ways to adapt to the Japanese 
distribution system. Local doctors will not accept or respond favorably to an 
American-style sales force. In Japan, when a doctor asks a local detail man to 
take a moment to photocopy some articles for him, he must be willing to do so. 
</P>
<P>
One common problem with insiderization, then, is a misplaced home-country 
reflex. Another problem is what happens back at headquarters after initial 
operations in another market really start paying off. When this happens, in 
most companies everyone at home starts to pay close attention. Without really 
understanding why things turned out so well, managers at headquarters take an 
increasing interest in what is going on in Japan or wherever. 
</P>
<P>
Functionaries of all stripes itch to intervene. Management decides that it 
should monitor key decisions, ask for timely reports, take extensive tours of 
local activities. Every power-that-be wants a say in what has become a critical 
portion of the company's overall operations. When minor difficulties arise, no 
one is willing to let local managers continue to handle things themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A cosmetics company with a once-enviable position in Japan went through a 
series of management shake-ups at home. As a result, the Japanese operation, 
which had grown progressively more important, was no longer able to enjoy the 
rough autonomy that made its success possible. Several times, eager American 
hands reached in to change the head of activities in Japan, and memos and phone 
calls kept up a steady barrage of challenges to the unlucky man who happened to 
be in the hot seat at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Relations became antagonistic, profits fell, the intervention grew worse and 
the whole thing just fell apart. Overeager and overanxious managers back at 
headquarters did not have the patience to learn what really worked in the 
Japanese market. By trying to supervise things in the regular "corporate" 
fashion, they destroyed a very profitable business. 
</P>
<P>
This is a familiar pattern. The local top manager regularly changes from a 
Japanese national to a foreigner, to a Japanese, to a foreigner. Impatient, 
headquarters keeps fitfully searching for a never-never ideal "person on the 
spot." 
</P>
<P>
Persistence and perseverance are the keys to long-term survival and success. 
But headquarters is just not able to wait a few years until local managers -- 
of whatever nationality -- build up the needed rapport with vendors, employees, 
distributors and customers. And if, by a miracle, they do, then headquarters is 
likely to see them as having become too "nationalized" to represent their 
interests abroad. They are no longer "one of us." And if they do not build up 
this rapport, then obviously they have failed to win local acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
This headquarters mentality is not just a problem of bad attitude or misguided 
enthusiasm. These would be relatively easy to fix. Instead, it rests on -- and 
is reinforced by -- a company's entrenched systems, structures and behaviors. 
</P>
<P>
Dividend payout ratios, for example, vary from country to country. But most 
global companies find it hard to accept low or no payout from investment in 
Japan, medium returns from West Germany and larger returns from the United 
States. The usual wish is to get comparable levels of return from all 
activities, and internal benchmarks of performance reflect that wish. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a 15% return on investment a year from new commitments in Japan 
will sour a company on the country very quickly. The companies that have done 
the best there -- the Coca-Colas and the IBMs -- were willing to adjust their 
conventional expectations and settle for the long term. 
</P>
<P>
Or, for example, when top managers rely heavily on financial statements, they 
can easily lose sight of the value of operating globally -- because these 
statements usually mask the performance of activities outside the home country. 
</P>
<P>
Accounting and reporting systems that are parent-company dominated -- and 
genuinely consolidated statements are still the exception, not the rule -- 
merely confirm the lukewarm commitment of many managers to global competition. 
They may talk about doing business globally, but it is just lip service. It 
sounds nice, but when things get tough, most of the talk turns out to be only 
that. 
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that many of the most globally successful Japanese 
companies -- Honda, Sony, Matsushita, Canon -- have been led by a strong 
owner-founder for at least a decade. These leaders can override bureaucratic 
inertia; they can tear down institutional barriers. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, the managerial decision to tackle organizational and systems 
changes is made even more difficult by the way in which problems become 
visible. Usually a global systems problem first comes into view in the form of 
local symptoms. Rarely do such problems show up where the real underlying 
causes are. 
</P>
<P>
Troubled chief executives may say that their Japanese operations are not doing 
well, that the money being spent on advertising is not paying off as expected. 
They will not say that their problems are really back at headquarters, with its 
superficial understanding of what it takes to market effectively in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
They will not say that it lies in the design of financial reporting systems. 
They will not say that it is part and parcel of their own reluctance to make 
long-term, front-end capital investments in new markets. They will not say that 
it lies in their failure to perform well in the central job of any headquarters 
operation: the development of good people at the local level. Or, at least, 
they are not likely to. They will diagnose the problems as local problems and 
try to fix them. 
</P>
<P>
Top managers are always slow to point the finger of responsibility at 
headquarters or at themselves. When global faults have local symptoms, they 
will be slower still. When taking corrective action means a full, zero-based 
review of all systems, skills and structures, their speed will decrease even 
further. And when their commitment to acting globally is itself far from 
complete, any motion is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
The headquarters mentality is the prime expression of managerial 
nearsightedness, the sworn enemy of a genuinely equidistant perspective on 
global markets.

ON VIEW: CURTAIN IS GOING UP ON OPERA'S 5TH SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fall means opera, the official opening of the September social season. Peggy 
Parker-Grauman and Jennifer Diener host a kickoff committee meeting at a 
luncheon Tuesday at Patina on Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth season of the Los Angeles Music Center Opera opens Sept. 4 with the 
gala benefit premiere of Beethoven's only opera, "Fidelio." Parker-Grauman and 
her husband, Walter Grauman, are chairing the evening and Jennifer and Royce 
Diener are co-chairmen. They hope for a moonlit post-performance party on the 
Music Center Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch underwrites both the opening-night performance and the gala. That 
means all proceeds from the $650-a-person event can go to the opera company. 
</P>
<P>
The executive committee includes Deborah and Tom Tellefsen, Katherine and Arpad 
Domyan, Ginny and Henry Mancini, Anne and Franklin Johnson, Carol and Warner 
Henry, Susana and Peter Funsten, Kathy and Bob Ray Offenhauser, Annette and 
Peter O'Malley, Lenore and Bernard Greenberg, Georgia Frontiere, Rosanna Hill 
and Jim Gigans. 
</P>
<P>
On the committee are Joan Hotchkis, Kathryn Klinger Belton, Hannah Carter, 
Alice Coulombe, Suzanne Rheinstein, Paulette Ziffren, Barbara Davis, Flora 
Thornton, Terri Childs, Jinny Geller, Enid Koffler, Winnie Schweitzer and many 
more. 
</P>
<P>
CATCH-UP: At the recent Nixon gala at the Century Plaza, there were travel 
asides. Former First Daughter Tricia Nixon Cox and her son, Christopher, had 
been invited to the White House earlier in the week. The story circulated that 
they wished to take a gift to the White House, and that Christopher decided it 
should be for First Dog Millie. Millie was routed from the Oval Office and 
received her present -- not specified -- in the family quarters where Tricia 
once lived. They flew to California on Air Force One for the gala. 
</P>
<P>
Julie and David Eisenhower and their three children were house guests after the 
gala at the St. Malo enclave in Oceanside, invited by Craig and Jane Gosden. 
Craig Gosden was an usher in the Eisenhower wedding and an assistant to John 
Ehrlichman, assistant to Nixon for domestic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
UPSCALE: Long Ellis, Robert J. Kelleher, Jack Kramer, Gerald L. Parsky and 
former U.S. Atty. Gen. William French Smith form the International Tennis Hall 
of Fame committee hosting Tennis Hall of Famers Alice Marble and Ellsworth 
Vines Aug. 2. They plan cocktails and a buffet dinner followed by a Night of 
Tennis at the Volvo Tennis/Los Angeles James E. West Center at UCLA. Proceeds 
will benefit the Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
THE WHIRL: Altovise Davis, widow of Sammy Davis Jr., plans to join Helen 
Harris, president of Retinitis Pigmentosa International at the Charity Awards 
Dinner Tuesday in Washington. The party will center around "Forgotten Eyes," 
the last recording Davis made. He also was co-host of the "Hope in Sight 
Telethon" for four years. Harris will receive the Presidential Award. 
Songwriter Carol Connors will also be honored. 
</P>
<P>
WITH LOVE: The Commons in Pasadena will sport continental jazz with the Jake 
Porter Band and gourmet fare for Hospice de Beaune at a benefit this evening 
for hospice programs in the West San Gabriel Valley. Behind the event is a 
dedicated lot, including Thomas D. Mone, Barbara Steinwedell, Ginny and Dick 
Stever, Anne and Bob Wycoff, Toni and Bob Niven. 
</P>
<P>
KUDOS: To John E. Anderson, new president of the UCLA Foundation . . . . 
</P>
<P>
To Dr. Tom Rockwell, new trustee of the National Museum of Health and Medicine 
Foundation . . . . 
</P>
<P>
To the Most Rev. John J. Ward and Vivian Minovich, honored by Catholic 
Charities at Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
PAST PERFECT: More than 350 were there to unveil SPRINT's (Special Preventive 
Research, Intervention and New Technology) 15,000-square-foot facility at the 
new UCLA Medical Plaza building. At the festivities were president and 
co-founder Nina Leif, Dr. Barbara Crandall, Dr. Kenneth Shine (dean of UCLA 
School of Medicine) and Leif's daughter, Marisa, 16, telling of help from 
SPRINT doctors . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Michael and Marilyn Diamond celebrated the Legal Aid Foundation at a cocktail 
party . . . . Judy Ovitz's and Garry Sato's North Beach Bar &amp; Grill was the 
site for fund raising for the Foundation of Saint John's Hospital.

ROGER SIMON: MATH ADDS UP TO LIFE'S BIGGEST PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We all know we will never need the math we studied in school. Math is something 
they made us study because school is designed to torture the young. 
</P>
<P>
And only by torturing the young do we prepare them for real life. 
</P>
<P>
I am out at one of those discount shopping malls, one based on the concept that 
people will burn $10 worth of gasoline driving to a place where they can save 
$7 on a pair of shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why I am there. I have found my shoes and only one woman is ahead of 
me in line. The woman has found a scuffed pair of shoes and is asking the girl 
behind the counter if she can get a bigger discount. 
</P>
<P>
The girl is wearing a name tag that says "Jeanne" and she cannot be more than 
15. She picks up the phone and talks to the manager and then puts down the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
"He says you get 10% off," Jeanne says. 
</P>
<P>
"That's fine," says the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Now Jeanne begins rummaging under the counter, pulling things from a shelf down 
there and piling them up on the countertop: scissors, a ball of string, papers, 
rubber bands, invoice books. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no calculator," Jeanne finally says in a voice close to tears. 
"There's s'posed to be a calculator. I can't do 10% in my head." 
</P>
<P>
The woman waiting for the 10% discount stands there. I stand there. 
</P>
<P>
"Barry," Jeanne shouts over to the kid at the next counter, who looks about 16. 
"Do you have the calculator?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," Barry says, "I think Ray has it and he's, like, spaced somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne now sighs a big, stagey sigh and lets her shoulders slump. She pokes 
through the junk on the counter one more time. "I can't do 10% in my head," she 
says again. 
</P>
<P>
The woman looks at her and then looks at me. 
</P>
<P>
I should explain that I was never any good at math. My SAT scores in math were 
so low that during my college interviews the interviewers said things like, 
"Did you leave the room halfway through?" or "Are you sure you understood the 
concept of multiple choice?" 
</P>
<P>
But I managed to get into college, anyway, and then I became an adult and, 
therefore, no longer needed math. 
</P>
<P>
Except that as a reporter, I found I needed math all the time. I found I needed 
math on police stories: if the gunman entered the bank at 4:17 p.m. and the 
hostages were not released until 1:02 a.m, how long were they held captive? 
</P>
<P>
I found I needed math on tax stories: If the average county tax bill was 
$3,334.47 last year and this year it's $4,567.29, by what percentage did it 
increase? 
</P>
<P>
I found I needed math, in fact, on all kinds of stories. So slowly and 
painfully I had to learn in real life what I had not learned in school. 
</P>
<P>
Which is exactly what my teachers had told me. "Mr. Simon! If you don't stop 
gazing out that window you will slowly and painfully have to learn some day 
what you are not learning right now!" 
</P>
<P>
But who listened to teachers? If they were so smart, how come they weren't 
making more money? 
</P>
<P>
Today, I am no math wizard. But I can do 10% in my head. 
</P>
<P>
Just like a whole bunch of you can. Depending on when you went to school, that 
is. If you went in the olden, low-tech days, they taught you such things. 
Today, school is much fancier. 
</P>
<P>
"How much are the shoes?" I asked Jeanne. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, $28.86," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"So you give her $2.89 off," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Really?" Jeanne said, as if I had, perhaps, chosen the numbers at random. 
"That's excellent!" She turned to the woman. "Is that OK with you?" 
</P>
<P>
The woman nodded. "Sounds right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne rang up the discount -- the cash register did the subtraction for her -- 
and the woman walked off happy. 
</P>
<P>
While Jeanne was ringing up my shoes, I talked to her. 
</P>
<P>
You in high school? I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," Jeanne said, concentrating on the numbers she was punching. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to make you feel bad or anything because I was lousy in math 
when I was in high school," I said. "But don't they teach you about decimals 
and percentages in school?" 
</P>
<P>
"In school," Jeanne said, "we get to use calculators." 
</P>
<P>
But of course they do. And why wouldn't they? Machines will do everything for 
us, won't they? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there are still some schools that do not allow kids to use calculators. 
And in those schools I am sure every day the kids moan and whine and say: "Why 
do we have to learn this decimal junk? When we grow up, we're going to use 
calculators anyway." 
</P>
<P>
And I know what teachers say back. They talk about the satisfaction of learning 
mathematical principles and the joy of conquering difficult concepts and the 
pride you can take in having mental tools that will last a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
But teachers should not bother saying such things. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they should tell the truth. 
</P>
<P>
They should say: "You have to learn this stuff because some day Ray may walk 
off with the calculator and get absolutely spaced."

ZAN THOMPSON: MUSICIANS CHECK IN TO ASPEN LONG AFTER SKIERS CHECK OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statue of Justice still stands on her platform on the face of the county 
courthouse, smiling a haughty welcome to miscreant and righteous visitors 
alike, her robe freshly silvered in the garish tone of a chewing gum wrapper. 
</P>
<P>
Aspen was founded when some adventurous miners crossed the Continental Divide 
at the top of Independence Pass and began the search for silver. In the summer 
of 1879 there were two log cabins and 12 inhabitants. Fifteen years later, in 
1894, Aspen was the third-largest city in Colorado, with 12,000 people, paved 
streets, gas street lamps, a streetcar line two miles long, three banks, a post 
office, an opera house, the courthouse, a city hall, a jail, a luxury hotel, a 
hospital and three daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
When the U.S. Congress went off the silver standard, silver lost its value and 
Aspen emptied almost as quickly as it had boomed. Miners and businessmen left 
the beautiful Roaring Fork River valley 8,000 feet high in the mountains, and 
the town went to sleep until the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Walter Paepke, chairman of the Chicago-based Container Corp. of 
America, decided the natural beauty of the valley made it ideal for a resort. 
He gathered snow-minded investors and built a ski resort. In 1949, Paepke made 
it a year-round resort by encouraging the Aspen Institute and the Aspen Music 
Institute to make the mountains ring with oratory and music in the summers. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, like other places, Aspen is almost immobilized by its popularity. 
You can't find a place to park. People circle the four-block radius of the 
Jerome Hotel, hoping someone will back out as they drive by. 
</P>
<P>
The Aspen Institute draws scholars, students and spectators from all over the 
world. Jean Erck and I were among several hundred people who heard Supreme 
Court Justice John Paul Stevens speak. He was in town to chair an Aspen 
Institute law seminar. Stevens opened with a few remarks, then fielded 
questions. I have done the same on several occasions when I had absolutely no 
prepared remarks. Some asked questions that were really speeches on subjects 
dear to their hearts. These spokesmen were inclined to ramble, causing fellow 
audience members to grumble and ask, "What was the question?" 
</P>
<P>
Students at the Aspen Music Institute are among the finest young musicians in 
the world. They are selected on the recommendations of teachers, professors and 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Some were playing downtown on the edge of the mall, and Jean and I sat on a 
park bench and listened to the sounds of pure beauty sail in the clear, sunny 
air. The conductor, a tall, thin man with wisps of white hair, looked as if he 
had fallen from the pages of a Dickens novel. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra is composed of students and older musicians who occupy first 
chairs worldwide. Jean and I and a dozen of her Aspen friends are going to a 
concert if it doesn't rain. The Music Institute orchestra plays in a huge tent 
that leaks like cheesecloth. 
</P>
<P>
It has rained -- and sometimes hailed -- every morning since I have been here. 
I had almost forgotten that rain can make the world alive and exciting, fresh 
and clean.

READERS SPLIT ON BAR ASSN. ABORTION VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Sipchen, when referring to the pro-life contingent of the bar association, 
raises the question, "What do religious beliefs have to do with the law?" He 
later writes, "If it were only a legal issue, though, there might be more room 
to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
The point is that both sides of the issue hold their positions religiously, 
which is evidenced by the fact that neither side has any intention of 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines religious as "relating to or 
manifesting faithful devotion to an acknowledged ultimate reality . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In the debate over the legitimacy of abortion, both sides admittedly manifest 
"faithful devotion," while only one side is ever referred to as religious 
zealots. Do both focus their faithful devotion on "an acknowledged ultimate 
reality?" The answer is without doubt yes.

SKIERS WHO HATE SUMMER CAN FIND FROSTY SLOPES, POWDER SNOWAND WINTER WEATHER AT

SANTIAGO, Chile 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's summertime, hot and hazy. Your skis are buried in the back of the garage. 
Dig them out. Because skiers who spend their summer counting the days till 
winter comes can fulfill their ski fantasies now. Snow season is in full swing 
in the Chilean Andes. 
</P>
<P>
Chile's ski season begins officially in June, but August and September are the 
best months to go. The weather and snow conditions are more dependable, the 
prices are lower and it's much less crowded. And it's easier to get there than 
most people think. Twice-a-week flights leave Los Angeles in the afternoon and 
arrive in Santiago the next morning, causing no more jet lag than taking the 
red-eye to New York. Little more than an hour's bus ride later, you can be in 
one of Chile's four major ski resorts. 
</P>
<P>
Only 35 miles from Santiago up a steep curvy road, at 8,860 feet, the base 
facilities for La Parva are terraced at the foot of the ski area. Old families 
from Santiago have skied this area for generations. Chileans -- as well as an 
increasing number of Argentines and Brazilians -- own many of the condominiums 
and some private homes. La Parva is their weekend getaway. 
</P>
<P>
I stood, on that first morning in La Parva last August, at 11,910 feet in the 
clear crisp air, looking down on sumptuous white rolls and hillocks in 
brilliant sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
An overnight blizzard had dropped two feet of snow over the Andes, and without 
a tree or a rock in sight, and only an occasional skier, my companions and I 
had nothing to stop us from pointing our skis in any direction. Swooping down 
gullies, up over ridges, making first tracks through knee-deep powder, we had 
to force ourselves to end the ecstasy and traverse back to the lift -- or else 
find ourselves below with a long walk back up. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I could ski in powder," remarked a gasping, excited New 
Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
I never thought I could either, until I was let loose on the wide open terrain 
of La Parva. 
</P>
<P>
Always above tree-line, the runs are clearly marked, but there is nothing to 
inhibit an average skier from meandering off the piste into untracked snow. 
Expert skiers revel in this complete freedom to fly off cornices, drop down 
chutes and to experience, without restrictions, the challenges that lure them 
to the sport of skiing. 
</P>
<P>
Beginners and intermediates can ski with reckless abandon or cautious euphoria 
over miles of open terrain. In Chile, there are no rules imposed by the ski 
area to protect them from liability, or you from your own negligence. You are 
responsible for your own safety -- and your own adventures. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations in La Parva are in modern two- and three-bedroom condominiums. 
It's a good idea to have your driver stop at a supermercado in Santiago to buy 
food on your way to the resort. There is a dining room and small bar for hotel 
guests, plus a small but lively restaurant called La Marmita. 
</P>
<P>
This is where we ate the night of the blizzard. Long wooden tables were crowded 
with cheese and meat fondue pots, devices for heating raclette (a cheese dish), 
and a variety of condiments. Bottles of robust red Chilean wine from the 
100-year-old vineyard of Cousino Macul were uncorked at each table. 
</P>
<P>
The owner kept the blender whirring with pisco sours -- a mixture of lemon 
juice and pisco, a Peruvian brandy. A generous local who was celebrating his 
50th birthday invited us all to share his champagne. This was definitely the 
locals' watering hole as ski instructors from Canada, the U.S., Australia, 
Chile and Argentina mingled with the guests. Champagne and pisco flowed. The 
tables were pulled to the wall and soon guests were making drinks behind the 
bar. The bartender was dancing on the tables with the guests, and cooks, 
waiters, instructors and local ski racers joined in the merriment that erased 
all national identities and joined us as skiers in an evening of raucous 
camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
La Parva is wide open and friendly. You can ski from your door to two chair 
lifts and nine Pomalifts (a chairless lift that employs a disc which one 
straddles while being pulled uphill.) These will transport you over gentle 
terrain on to the more demanding slopes where the Canadian National team trains 
in the summer. We watched them jumping off the roofs of farmhouses between 
slalom runs. Snowboarding is a fast growing sport in Chile, as it is in the 
U.S. Lessons and rentals are available and there are plenty of low cornices to 
twist up, down and over along the edge of the pistes. 
</P>
<P>
Each day ends around 5:30 p.m. with a gold alpenglow washing over the slopes, 
then fading as a brilliant red sunset smolders in the western sky over 
Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
I skied with my friends over the pass from La Parva into Valle Nevado; we 
started at the top, from 12,000 feet down to 9,000. There are 33 square miles 
of skiable terrain, and the area is still being enlarged. Every time I got off 
a lift and thought I'd reached the outer limits of the ski area, off on the 
horizon, another Pomalift would unfold across another mountain top. We skied on 
groomed pistes and wide open untracked powder runs. "This is like 
four-and-a-half Vails," one person remarked. 
</P>
<P>
Valle Nevado is the biggest, newest and most-talked-about ski area in South 
America. When fully developed, and if joined with nearby Farellones/El Colorado 
and La Parva, it will be one of the largest ski complexes in the world. 
</P>
<P>
If you've ever longed for the solitude that cross-country skiers enjoy, with 
all the conveniences of a modern resort then this ski area is for you. With 
three peaks, Valle Nevado has room for 30,000 skiers. The day I was there, only 
200 people were skiing. Every trail and lift has clear directional signs with 
pictures showing the best route to the lodge, so, barring a blizzard, you 
cannot get lost. 
</P>
<P>
Heli-skiing is available through the hotel at reasonable rates. The open 
terrain, the probability of dry, light snow and the proximity to the lodge make 
this exotic option seem uncomplicated, accessible and a good investment. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 60 miles from Santiago, Valle Nevado is being developed by the same 
French company that developed Les Arcs in France. This well-funded and 
dedicated group of investors plans to increase the number of lifts from the 
present eight to more than 50. The attractive 160-bed hotel, the condominiums, 
apartments and the superb restaurant featuring fresh vegetables and juicy 
steaks from Argentina give Valle Nevado a special Chilean/French flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The first skiers at the granddaddy of South American ski resorts -- Portillo -- 
were Norwegian mountaineers who came in 1890 to study the construction of a 
railroad between Chile and Argentina. The first lift, built in 1937, had wooden 
towers. In 1947, it was replaced by a chairlift, and by 1949, the first hotel 
was built. Portillo has attracted some impressive ski personalities to its 
school -- Emil Allais, Stein Erickson, Peter Estin and Othmar Schneider were 
the pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
For years I had been impressed by stories of this legendary and remote ski 
area: its World-Cup-quality downhill, its speed skiing, heli-skiing, fierce 
storms and avalanches. When I finally landed in a helicopter in front of the 
bright yellow Portillo Hotel (the road was closed by an avalanche), I was 
surprised to find such a benign little spot. Nearby was a still lake and all 
around, great soaring peaks. 
</P>
<P>
Because 80% of the its guests are repeat visitors, the hotel has a comfortable 
clubbiness about it. There are only 478 beds and no plans to expand, so make 
your reservations early. 
</P>
<P>
Although the road closes infrequently, and seldom for more than two days, at 
such times the management does everything possible to get travelers through. 
The day I arrived, two helicopters moved 160 people in and 70 out. If you are 
traveling independently, it's a good idea to call the resort before you start 
out, either from Santiago or from the nearest town of Los Andes. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as I checked into my fourth-floor room in Portillo, I stood transfixed 
by the view from the window. The ice melting on the Laguna del Inca gave a 
fractured reflection of rock, snow and jagged peaks slashing the sky. 
Reluctantly, I dashed downstairs and out to the nearest chairlift. 
</P>
<P>
Portillo offers some of the most challenging terrain -- and ski lifts -- in 
South America. Where avalanches would wipe out lift towers on steep upper 
slopes, the French invented the Va et Vient lift, also known as "the sling 
shot." Portillo's contraption shoots four people standing abreast up 2,442 
feet, where they scramble to disengage themselves without falling back down the 
mountainside. Imagine a high-speed four-person Pomalift with no off ramp. 
</P>
<P>
On the lower slopes are long groomed runs and the very steep garganta (throat) 
that seems to drop right into the Laguna del Inca. Overall, there is an 
interesting variety of terrain, but not a lot of it. There are other options, 
however, such as heli-skiing near the Argentine border, guided off-piste 
excursions, snowboarding and parasailing. 
</P>
<P>
I tried tandem hang-gliding. Strapped in with an instructor, I skied straight 
off a cliff and soared out over the ski runs. The hotel looked like a tiny 
yellow box as we circled above and then came in low across the still icy lake, 
landing with ease by the rental shop door. A camera mounted on the wing strut 
recorded our flight, making the $40 fee well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
The Portillo Hotel is the center of activities. It has a small outdoor pool, an 
ice rink when the lake freezes, a large gymnasium for indoor soccer, volleyball 
or basketball, and a beauty salon, massage rooms, video and game parlors. At 
night, an air of Old World elegance previals; men wear coats and ties to dinner 
and women dress in slacks or skirts and fancy sweaters. On the slopes and in 
the hotel at Portillo, I felt I was in a serious ski resort and very much in 
the Andes. 
</P>
<P>
Some 250 miles south of Santiago is the town of Chillan, which can be reached 
by car on a good road, by train (six hours), or by plane (one hour). The ski 
area, known as Termas de Chillan, is 51 miles further, at an elevation of 5,900 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel at Termas de Chillan is comfortable but not luxurious. It has 350 
beds in about 100 rooms, and its main attraction, (other than skiing), are the 
hot baths that have existed there for 150 years. There are sulfur baths, iron 
baths, mud facials, hydro massage, plus saunas and steam baths. 
</P>
<P>
New owners of Chillan have ambitions to improve the ski facilities and enlarge 
the hotel, making it a major-league ski area. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the hotel with my friends for lunch, we were serenaded by an 
orchestra that also played in the evenings for dancing. We devoured an abundant 
buffet of meats, cheeses, salads, fruits and seafood specialties, then rushed 
out to enjoy the longest run in Chillan, 5.6 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Over unexpected rolls and into blind gullies, we skied on spring snow into a 
forest of moss-covered trees. A bus was waiting at the bottom to return us to 
the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
One of the pleasures I looked forward to each day was a long soak in one of the 
three large mineral pools outside the hotel. Only a few flying snowballs 
launched by rambunctious Brazilians interrupted this perfect apres-ski. 
</P>
<P>
Chillan had the most varied terrain and snow conditions of any place I skied in 
Chile. We had one day of powder skiing on very steep slopes, and the next day 
we rode the longest chairlift in South America (8,200 feet). It took 25 minutes 
to reach the top. Someone suggested an in-flight magazine ought to come with 
the ride. From there we had 15,000 acres of slopes to choose from. With 
volcanoes above and thermal springs belching steam from the side of the 
mountains, Chillan was yet another unusual ski experience in Chile.

SANTIAGO: A MERE HOUR FROM THE SLOPES

SANTIAGO, Chile 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For first-time travelers to South America, Santiago, wedged between desert and 
mountain in a valley dotted with vineyards, is like a dip in a lukewarm pool -- 
refreshing but not shocking. This is a soothing city, affordable and easy to 
get around in. And Chilean hospitality, renowned across the continent, lives up 
to its reputation. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. skiers trying out any of Chile's best known slopes are less than 90 
minutes from its urban delights. People are friendly and casual, shopping 
bargains abound, meals are accompanied by some of the continent's finest wine, 
and cultural attractions are many in the native land of two Nobel prize-winning 
poets, Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral. 
</P>
<P>
Most people visit Santiago during its warm months from December to March. But 
the intense summer heat -- hovering in the 90s for days -- is too warm for some 
visitors and sends even residents fleeing into its many parks and pedestrian 
malls. Temperatures in the winter months, June through September, can drop to 
near freezing at night and daytime drizzle is common, but travelers with 
slickers or overcoats can explore the city comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
"The advantage of Chile in the winter is that there are a lot of activities. . 
. ballet, theater, opera, just about anything you can imagine in a developed 
cultural center," said Marilyn Pugh, tour manager for LanChile Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago's main square, the Plaza de Armas, is where the city was founded 449 
years ago by ragged Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia. The plaza was used 
for public floggings and hangings in colonial days, but now it's inhabited by 
shoeshine boys, vagrants, strolling couples and youngsters kicking soccer 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
The square is bordered by Sanitago's fourth cathedral -- earthquakes and fires 
destroyed the first three on the site -- with its religious art museum, the 
pink post office building used as Chile's first presidential palace and the 
National Historical Museum, whose documents, furnishings and paintings trace 
the country's struggle for independence. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked under the arches off the plaza is popular Chez Henry, a three-in-one 
stop with a delicatessan-wine shop, restaurant and nightclub. The deli clerks 
offer good advice on Chilean wines and the restaurant, crowded around the 
clock, specializes in Italian pastas and such Chilean dishes as pastel de 
choclo, a rich corn and meat casserole. 
</P>
<P>
Two blocks away on Merced Street is an art collection that links Chile with its 
most unusual possession -- Easter Island, 2,300 miles away in the Pacific 
Ocean. The Merced Church museum has wood carvings, ceramics and other artifacts 
from this volcanic island, whose famous huge stone statues, called moai, have 
fascinated archaeologists ever since they were discovered. (One moai has been 
transported to the grassy promenade of Avenida Libertador O'Higgins.) 
</P>
<P>
The church museum also offers a crash course in Latin America's violently 
graphic, colonial religious art, including bloody statues covered by crystal 
bell jars. The bell jars, survivors of an ocean journey from Europe and 
Santiago's frequent earthquakes, originally displayed erotic objects -- which 
religious Santiaguinos, as city residents are known, replaced with Christian 
images. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown Santiago is cut by two pedestrian malls where bankers in dark suits 
and window shoppers with children in tow cross paths. The malls, Paseo Ahumada 
and Paseo Huerfanos, are lined with banks, currency exchange offices, travel 
agencies, airlines, shoe stores (great buys on leather), boutiques and pastry 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
On Ahumada, the pungent smell of coffee is a tantalizing sign that Cafe Haiti 
or Cafe Caribe -- the city's trendiest daytime stops -- are near. Chile 
produces no coffee, making the real stuff a luxury. What most restaurants serve 
is instant Nescafe. At these stand-up counters, thick strong coffee is served 
by women outfitted in exotic jungle prints. Executives hash out business deals 
over cafe con leche (coffee with milk). 
</P>
<P>
Ahumada's landmark is Falabella, Santiago's biggest department store, just two 
blocks from the Plaza de la Libertad, or Liberty Square. The plaza, sided by 
the imposing Palacio de la Moneda, has become a symbol of modern Chile's 
darkest days. 
</P>
<P>
Built as the Spanish royal mint and decried for its size and exorbitant cost, 
the austere structure serves as Chile's equivalent of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, during the democratic country's only military coup, President Salvador 
Allende was killed inside La Moneda by military forces under Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
When foreign journalists entered La Moneda earlier this year, for the first 
time in 16 years, they saw the bunker built secretly during Pinochet's reign. 
Now, with the military dictatorship gone and President Patricio Alywin 
installed by democratic vote, the carbine-carrying police are no longer 
intimidating. Chile's economy is stable and there is a relatively low crime 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
To the side of La Moneda is the Carrera Hotel, headquarters for journalists who 
covered the coup and still one of Santiago's most elegant hotels. 
</P>
<P>
From the Carrera's front door -- or the plaza itself -- visitors can watch the 
midday changing of the guard at La Moneda. Circling the plaza are a number of 
international banks, the signposts of a country that has consistently boasted 
foreign investment while its neighbors fought roller coaster fluctuations in 
inflation, prices and salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The best site for an overview of the city is the Cerro San Cristobal, a hilltop 
park crowned by a massive statue of the Virgin Mary, her arms outstretched over 
Santiago. When the smog (which exceeded pollution levels of Los Angeles and 
Mexico City in 1989) is light, one can see the city -- the Andes peaks to the 
east and the slopes of the coastal mountains to the west. 
</P>
<P>
Cerro San Cristobal's park, with a zoo, botanical gardens, two swimming pools, 
picnic grounds and hiking paths is one of South America's finest. It can be 
reached by car, cab or funicular railway. Once in the park, a skylift takes 
visitors up the 1,145-foot hill to the Enoteca. 
</P>
<P>
A whitewashed neocolonial building tucked behind a grove of palm trees, the 
Enoteca houses a wine museum, wine-tasting salon and is one of the city's best 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
At dinner, there's a show of traditional Chilean music and dance. Enoteca 
manager, Max Rodriguez, speaks English and is happy to suggest world-class 
wines to accompany meals or to take home. The best-known labels are Concha y 
Toro, Cousino Macul, Santa Carolina and Undurraga. The finest reserves come 
from the Maipo valley just outside Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
At the base of Cerro San Cristobal is Bellavista, the city's Bohemian district 
where artists, writers and poets huddle together over inexpensive seafood meals 
and musicians share bottles of wine, conversing in the smoky bistros dotting 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Bellavista is almost clogged with shops specializing in the copper and lapis 
lazuli items for which Chile is famous. The bright blue gemstones are 
incorporated into everything from necklaces to silverware. More lapis lazuli is 
found a few blocks east in the government-run CEMA store at Avenida Portugal 
351 in the Providencia neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Set up to sell the handicrafts of young mothers, the nationwide CEMA stores 
offer Chile's biggest and best variety of handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
Once a rural area, Providencia is a posh shopping district named for the 
Sisters of Providence and the huge adobe convent they opened in 1853. This is 
the stomping ground of Santiago's rich, a neighborhood of exclusive boutiques, 
intimate European-style hotels, chic restaurants and Mercedes-Benzes -- 
although the latter spend more time in their carports now, thanks to a strict 
new anti-pollution law that imposes a revolving ban on cars one day a week, 
depending on the final numbers on their license plates. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these wealthy residents are the descendants of Chile's wine and mine 
magnates. A microcosm view of that opulence is seen at Palacio Cousino, a 
neoclassical mansion built in 1878 as a private home where visiting royalty 
could stay while in Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Although a fire sparked by a short circuit botched plans for British Queen 
Elizabeth's overnight stay there in 1968, the home's guest roster includes 
Golda Meir, Charles de Gaulle and Indira Gandhi 
</P>
<P>
Palacio Cousino is a marvel of gilt-edged mirrors, parquet floors, stunning 
paintings, porcelain, furniture and draperies brought from Europe more than a 
century ago to grace its rooms. And rooms there are: tearoom, arms room, winter 
garden (a greenhouse salon kept steamy by hot water pipes running beneath its 
Italian tile floor) and a billiard room now used as a gallery for work by 
Chilean artists. 
</P>
<P>
But the best art is at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in the wooded Parque 
Forestal beside the Mapocho River. The National Fine Arts Museum joins the 
Museum of Popular American Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art in the 
recently renovated Palacio, a building that cleverly employs natural light in 
galleries featuring Chilean works, modern art from a number of countries and 
first-rate traveling shows. 
</P>
<P>
Each August, the museum displays designs by Chilean architects that inevitably 
spark lively public debate. Architects are highly respected in Chile, and their 
works so exalted that homes in moneyed areas bear their architect's name on 
exterior plaques. 
</P>
<P>
City maps, English-language brochures and tour information in Santiago are 
available at the Chilean National Tourist Office, Avenida Providencia 1550, 
phone 698-2151.

TOURISM: THE RUSH IS ON TO VISIT EASTERN EUROPE FROM ALL POINTS WEST. HOTELS, 
AIRLINES AND CAR-RENTAL COMPANIES ARE SCRAMBLING TO DEAL WITH THE DEMAND. FOR A 
WHILE AT LEAST, DON'T EXPECT HASSLE-FREE HOLIDAYS.

<P>
If you like rapidly evolving positive statistics, then you already love Eastern 
Europe. It seems that when it comes to travel and tourism figures, nearly 
everyone speaks in superlatives. 
</P>
<P>
Boom, explosion and flood are words often used to report on the thousands of 
tourists flocking to Eastern Europe. To be sure, the numbers are impressive: 
During the first four months of this year, 4.18 million visitors from 
hard-currency areas (mostly Western Europe and North America) had traveled to 
Hungary, up a staggering 70% from the same period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues on Pam Am flights to Eastern Europe were 15 times higher in 1989 than 
in the previous six years. Hotel space in Warsaw and Berlin is jammed. Even 
charter airlines have gotten into the act. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, American Trans Air commenced service to Riga, Latvia, from New York. 
On the ground, some countries seem to be moving faster than others. Perhaps the 
fastest is Hungary. By Sept. 1, three new hotels will open in Budapest, adding 
900 much-needed rooms to the city. 
</P>
<P>
In Bulgaria, a country generally ignored by Western tourists, officials have 
announced hopes to build 30 "Western-style" properties in the next five years. 
Government authorities are actively negotiating with Sheraton (which already 
manages one Bulgarian property in Sofia), Hyatt, Hilton International and 
Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, 53 of the country's newest and biggest hotels have announced 
that they can now be booked directly from the West, instead of via the official 
Cedok government service. The hotels can also be reserved in advance with U.S. 
dollars, instead of with the Czech koruna. 
</P>
<P>
In the air, former Communist regimes are moving quickly to become truly 
competitive with the West: They are ordering U.S.-made planes and upgrading 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Malev, the Hungarian airline, has plans to replace its entire fleet of 21 
Soviet-built jets with U.S. airplanes. LOT, the Polish airline, is now using 
some Boeing equipment. (None of the airlines has started a frequent flier 
program . . . yet.) 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Communist world has embraced capitalism, it seems that every 
airline, hotel group, rental-car company and tour operator wants to return the 
gesture. 
</P>
<P>
Already, many airlines, including U.S. carriers, have either applied for new 
routes to Eastern Europe or have increased service there. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel companies have announced new construction or management contracts to run 
existing hotels. For example, Sheraton, Hyatt, Marriott, Ramada and Pullman 
hotels have announced plans to build new hotels in such cities as Warsaw, 
Belgrade and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
And tour operators are now offering tours to previously inaccessible 
destinations, or places that had been severely limited to tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The barriers have indeed come down. But what will travelers find behind the 
doors? 
</P>
<P>
As euphoria begins to settle into the reality of continuing economic despair 
for most of these countries, there are a few things you should know before 
booking your trip East. 
</P>
<P>
Since tourism is so dependent on service, the development of Eastern European 
tourism starts with two strikes against it. 
</P>
<P>
"People were downright giddy with joy," says one hotelier in Germany. "But the 
problem comes with their expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Berlin Wall came crashing down, many U.S. travel concerns -- hotels, 
tour operators and airlines -- were already operating in countries such as 
Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a number of corporations were complaining about the difficulties of 
doing business in the Eastern Bloc. Officials of InterContinental Hotels met 
privately to discuss pulling out of some Eastern European cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It was getting impossible to maintain our style of service there," reports one 
general manager who attended the high-level meetings. "We couldn't get supplies 
that our international guests had come to expect, and worse, we couldn't get 
such basic services as water, natural gas and electricity on a consistent 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
Just when InterContinental was getting ready to pull the plug on some of its 
hotels, the Berlin Wall came down and, suddenly, the rush was on for Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, even when light appeared at the end of the tunnel, it seemed the 
tunnel kept getting longer. For example, the Soviets opened a luxury hotel in 
Moscow (the Savoy, formerly the Berlin Hotel) as a joint venture with a Finnish 
company. 
</P>
<P>
The newly renovated hotel boasted room service, a bar with cable TV and 
Moscow's first approved casino (restricted to holders of a foreign passport or 
Western credit card). That's the good news. 
</P>
<P>
Now, try to get a room there. The hotel is booked -- for the next five years 
solid -- by Finnair for its clients. 
</P>
<P>
Another continuing problem with traveling to Eastern Europe is in the area of 
rental cars and the hassle of fuel compatibility. As a number of tourists 
discovered recently, it is virtually impossible (with the exception of Hungary) 
to find unleaded gas in Eastern Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
But almost every car rented in Western Europe takes unleaded fuel only. As a 
result, a number of unsuspecting travelers rented cars in France and West 
Germany, only to run out of gas in Eastern Europe. They had to abandon their 
cars there. Not surprisingly, retrieving the cars was a costly experience both 
for the companies and the renters. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, at least for the time being, if you plan on renting a car for a trip 
through Eastern Europe, it might be a better idea to wait until you get there. 
For example, Budget Rent-A-Car has offices in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland 
and Yugoslavia, and the company guarantees its rates in U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Europcar (the National Car Rental affiliate in Europe) has opened offices in 
East Berlin and Leipzig. You can also find Europcar outlets in Yugoslavia, 
Poland, Hungary and Romania. 
</P>
<P>
But before you rush over to Eastern Europe, you need to face some facts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hotel space is tight. Polish officials estimate that Warsaw will need 3,000 
more hotel beds every night from now through the end of September. Prague has a 
similar problem. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Even if you can get a room, expect to pay for it. Already, the East Germans 
have raised hotel room rates as much as 50% over 1989. And don't expect all the 
usual amenities. First, most Eastern European hotel rooms are not 
well-designed. Don't always expect hot water or consistent electrical current. 
And, sometimes, don't even expect soap. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Think ahead. Bring an extra roll of toilet paper, your own washcloth and 
extra soap. If, like me, you get spoiled and frequently use hotel-supplied 
shampoo when traveling, don't be surprised if those kinds of products are not 
in your bathroom when you arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finally, don't go anywhere in Eastern Europe without a confirmed 
reservation . . . in writing.

HARBOR TOWN LAYS (DUBIOUS) MAYFLOWER CLAIM

HARWICH, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We came to this harbor town on the channel coast of Essex for only one reason: 
to catch the ferry to Goteborg, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
But before we left, we found ourselves caught up in an ongoing local 
controversy over the origins and history of the Mayflower, the doughty little 
square-rigger that took the first settlers to New England in 1620. 
</P>
<P>
We also found ourselves caught up in the many charms and attractions of 
Harwich, one of the cleanest and brightest of the English ferry ports. 
</P>
<P>
Harwich (the natives pronounce it HARE-ridge) and its holiday suburb, 
Dovercourt, look over the English Channel from cliffs where many of the 
concrete bunkers built to repel Adolph Hitler's armies still glower over the 
shingle beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Parade, extending two miles along the front, has little of the 
commercialism one expects in a seaside resort. Except for a scattering of small 
hotels, restaurants and a children's play park, the Parade and the many streets 
leading into it are staunchly residential in character. Queen Victoria, whose 
statue dominates the promenade, looks on approvingly. 
</P>
<P>
From the Cliff, our hotel on the Marine Parade, we could watch a constant 
stream of vessels entering the harbor -- the huge continental ferries, tankers, 
container ships and a bustle of yachts and fishing craft. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Harwich is free of the noise, grime and congestion common to harbor cities 
because most of the incoming cargo ships berth across the estuary at 
Felixstowe. And the ferries from the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway and 
Sweden, carrying hundreds of huge lorries and a thousand or more passenger cars 
daily, dock at Parkeston Quays outside the town. 
</P>
<P>
Harwich has a long seafaring history. Elizabeth's great captains -- Drake, 
Frobisher and Hawkins -- set sail from its expansive natural harbor in the 
estuary of the rivers Stour and Orwell. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Pepys, the diarist and man of letters, was Harwich's member of 
Parliament while serving in a high administrative position in the Royal Navy. 
</P>
<P>
English ships -- perhaps the Mayflower herself -- left Harwich to do battle 
with the Spanish Armada. And the one fact on which all disputants in the 
Mayflower debate can agree is that her captain, Christopher Jones, had his home 
in Harwich. 
</P>
<P>
Our first morning in town we met George Washington. He was watering a rose bed 
in front of his home on Fronks Road, just around the corner from our hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Could he direct us to the old harbor? Washington, a sturdy septuagenarian with 
fading tattoos on his arms, was clearly a former sailor. 
</P>
<P>
"Aye, steady as you go to the next turning," he said. "Then bear to starboard 
and keep walking. But mind you, don't walk too far or you'll fall in the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
It was then that he told us his name was George Washington. "No relative of 
your Washington that I know of," he said. It's a common name in Essex. 
</P>
<P>
"But you should look into the history of this town. We had a lot to do with 
settling America -- and long before your General Washington and his revolution. 
Did you know that the Mayflower, her master and crew all came from Harwich?" 
</P>
<P>
Then, smiling: "But of course you would know that. Doesn't every last American 
claim to have had an ancestor on the Mayflower?" 
</P>
<P>
Following his directions, we set off for the waterfront, strolling past 
courtyards with immaculate gardens and the staid Georgian residences of former 
sea captains. 
</P>
<P>
Above the harbor entrance we found yet another reminder of Britain's 
centuries-long fear of invasion -- a huge circular redoubt built in 1809-1810 
to counter the danger of a Napoleonic assault. Its cannons still point seaward, 
but the redoubt is now a historical museum. 
</P>
<P>
We finally found the home of Christopher Jones at 21 King's Head St., its 
facade bright with hanging baskets of fuchsia, geranium and lobelia. 
</P>
<P>
The two-store Elizabethan structure was once directly on the water, but because 
the quay was successively built farther into the harbor, the house now stands 
half a block inland. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street is a pub, the Alma Inn, once the home of Jones' first wife, 
whose unlikely name was Sarah Twitt. It was a warm day and we couldn't resist 
having a beer whose equally unlikely name was Tolly Cobbold. 
</P>
<P>
An old-timer at the bar, weary of yet more Americans milling about to pay 
homage to the master of the Mayflower, spoke to us in a loud voice. "Didn't 
know, did you, that Jones was a bloody pirate at one time and would have gone 
to prison if one of his lordly friends hadn't spoken up for him?" 
</P>
<P>
No, we didn't know that, and the fact that no other denizen of the bar spoke up 
in Jones' defense gave us pause. 
</P>
<P>
But at the Pier Hotel, facing the main shipping channel, we found nothing but 
enthusiastic acceptance of all local claims relating to the Mayflower. 
</P>
<P>
A man behind the desk agreed with George Washington that her captain and crew 
for the voyage to America were from her home port of Harwich. And that the 
Mayflower was actually built in the yard just across the road from this hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Was he certain? "Absolutely. I can take you upstairs and from rooms one, two 
and three you can see the exact spot where her keel was laid." 
</P>
<P>
We went across the road to what is now the Navyard Wharf and found a plaque 
listing the 75 ships that had been built there. Most of them had names meant to 
intimidate an enemy -- Conqueror, Alarm, Terror, Arrogant, Robust and Terrible. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the Mayflower, all were men-of-war and, to add to our suspicions of 
the hotel informant's probity, all had been built long after the 1620 sailing 
of the Mayflower. In fact, the yard was not in operation before 1620. 
</P>
<P>
Now adrift in a sea of confusion, we sought further enlightenment from yet 
another former seafarer, Reg Kenneisen, whom we met along the wharf, near a 
colorful jumble of channel buoys. He was watching an ancient Thames sailing 
barge working its way upriver under a canopy of brown sails. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-channel, rusting at their moorings, was a flotilla of red lightships, 
made obsolete by electronic buoys. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneisen, who wore an old Greek seaman's cap and pea jacket, had been a 
journalist and an instructor in civil engineering in East Africa. But he had 
been drawn irresistibly to the sea, crewing on round-the-world freighters for 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he had heard that Harwich was the Mayflower's home port, but when and for 
how long a time he didn't know. Nor did he know if crew members, other than 
Jones, came from Harwich. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard stories, however, that they would careen the Mayflower on the mud 
banks over there near Felixstowe and scrape the barnacles from her bottom," 
Kenneisen said. 
</P>
<P>
He told us our best source of information would be a chap over at the Guildhall 
who serves as the local historian, and we left him to resume his musings over 
other ships and harbors he had known. 
</P>
<P>
The route to the Guildhall on Church Street was through narrow streets and past 
innumerable pubs and an occasional shop dealing in old marine charts and 
antiques. A lofty gray brick lighthouse, no longer in use, rises like a church 
spire from the center of town. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard T. Weaver, who could double for George Burns, was the former history 
master at the local high school, former mayor of Harwich and at present the 
town's archivist and historian. 
</P>
<P>
An energetic 84, he let us know within seconds of greeting us that "Most of 
what you've heard regarding the Mayflower is rubbish. It is either untrue or 
lacking historical evidence." 
</P>
<P>
His hand swept his cubbyhole of an office with its stacks of yellowing 
documents and wall cabinets full of bound volumes of the history of Harwich 
dating to AD 885. 
</P>
<P>
"Until now," he said, "you've heard nothing but bits and bobs of the story -- 
most of it wrong. From me you'll hear nothing but cast-iron fact." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver told us that there was no question that the Mayflower, then transporting 
wine from French ports to Britain, had early associations with Harwich. 
</P>
<P>
He produced documents from the High Court of Admiralty for 1609 and 1610, 
referring to "X'p'ffer Jones of Harwich, Mr. (master) of the Mayflower of the 
same place." 
</P>
<P>
But nowhere, said Weaver, "are records showing where she was built. The fact 
is, Mayflower was a common name for ships along this coast. To attract American 
tourists, a number of towns in East Anglia claim she was built in their yards 
centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Up in Buckinghamshire, the town of Jordans charges you Yanks money to see a 
barn presumably built from the Mayflower's timbers. It's a fiddle." 
</P>
<P>
Did the crew at least come from Harwich? "I'm sorry can't send you home with a 
better story," said Weaver, "but there's no evidence of that either." 
</P>
<P>
Taking us to the door, the archivist told us he was no stranger to America. He 
had made visits to New England, at the invitation of local historical 
societies, to lecture on early English settlements in the New World. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I was there," he said, "a chap told me I could earn a hundred 
dollars a night repeating my lecture to church audiences. I told him I was not 
a believer, but for money like that I'd become another Billy Graham." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver saw us off down the street, the sun glinting from his thick, horn-rimmed 
glasses, lacking only one of George Burns' favorite cigars.

CLIMB PIKES PEAK FOR FAMOUS VIEW OF A STUNNING AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. R. REID, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No doubt you know that it bears the best-known name of any mountain in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
What you probably don't know, unless you've made the spectacular, winding trip 
to the top, is that the snow-capped massif called Pikes Peak also offers the 
most famous vista to be seen from any American mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Looking eastward from the summit of Pikes Peak, 14,110 feet above sea level, 
you see an endless expanse of spacious skies stretching over amber waves of 
grain. 
</P>
<P>
When you turn around and gaze west, you see purple mountain majesties above the 
fruited plain. And as you look over this scenic splendor, you know for certain 
that you have found America the beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
If those descriptive phrases sound familiar, they should. For it was here on 
the summit of Pikes Peak, in the Front Range of the Colorado Rockies just 20 
miles west of Colorado Springs, that a Wellesley College professor named 
Katharine Lee Bates was moved to write the poem that has become the national 
anthem of our nation's physical grandeur: "America the Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Much has changed about America since the July day in 1893 when Bates traveled 
to the summit and was instantly inspired to create her moving hymn. Happily, 
though, the view from atop Pikes Peak has not changed much at all. 
</P>
<P>
All the wonders that sent Bates scrambling for pen and paper are still here to 
see. The rolling waves of grain fields to the east still glisten a deep amber 
beneath a mid-summer sun. And the imposing mountain majesties off to the west 
-- ridge after ridge of snowcapped ranges -- really do look purple against the 
dark blue Rocky Mountain sky. 
</P>
<P>
Thus if you're searching for a travel destination that will prove -- either to 
yourself or to your kids -- that this country is still America the beautiful, 
you can't go wrong by planning a trip to southern Colorado and a trek to the 
top of Pikes Peak. 
</P>
<P>
There were three ways to get to the top of the Peak when Bates made the trip: 
by foot, by train and by carriage. The same three ways are available today, 
except that the horse-drawn carriage that took Bates and her party up the Pikes 
Peak Highway has been replaced by the family car. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you choose to hike, the trip today is quick and relatively easy. A round 
trip on the Cog Railway that chugs up the mountain's east face takes three 
hours and 10 minutes, including a little less than an hour at the top. 
</P>
<P>
Driving the steep, winding 20-mile highway takes about an hour each way. Which 
means you will probably spend just half a day visiting America's most famous 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it hadn't been lucky enough to be given a memorably alliterative name, 
Pikes Peak would almost certainly have become a famous natural feature. This is 
a simple fact of geography. 
</P>
<P>
Pikes Peak is the easternmost of the "fourteeners" -- the elite category of 
American mountains reaching higher than 14,000 feet. As such, it was the first 
to be "discovered" when the white man began exploring the mountain west nearly 
two centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Army lieutenant, Zebulon Montgomery Pike, was dispatched in 1806 to head 
an exploratory troop mapping the lower reaches of the Louisiana Purchase -- 
sort of a southern version of the Lewis and Clark expedition. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Arkansas River west from the Mississippi, Pike and his men spent 
week after redundant week traversing the empty flatlands of the high plains. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Nov. 16, 1806, on an eastern Colorado meadow about 120 miles from the 
present city of Colorado Springs, Pike looked up to the west and saw "a small 
blue cloud." 
</P>
<P>
As they came closer, the soldiers gradually realized that this spot on the sky 
was really a massive, snow-draped mountain. Thanks to the prerogatives of rank, 
the peak was eventually named for the commanding officer of the troop that 
found it. 
</P>
<P>
That enormous mountain marks an abrupt shift in the topography of the 
continent. Here the flat, featureless meadowland of middle America gives way to 
the wrinkled spine of Rocky Mountains that make up the Continental Divide. 
</P>
<P>
And the change occurs with dramatic suddenness. With just a few low foothills 
before it, Pikes Peak juts up abruptly from the plains to scratch the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the nation's easternmost alp quickly became a powerful symbol of 
the rugged West -- "the most celebrated peak in America," as the Forest Service 
puts it. 
</P>
<P>
When the gold seekers of 1859 set out from Kansas City, their wagons were 
emblazoned with the famous slogan, "Pikes Peak or Bust." 
</P>
<P>
Over time, railroad interests created a resort city, Colorado Springs, at the 
base of the mountain to help draw tourists. Hiking trails, the cog railroad and 
a narrow carriage road were constructed on the mountain to carry visitors to 
the peak of the Peak. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it was only natural when Katharine Lee Bates arrived in the Springs to 
teach a summer school course at Colorado College -- one of her faculty 
colleagues that summer of '93 was a political scientist from Princeton named 
Woodrow Wilson -- that she should set aside a day to travel to the summit. 
</P>
<P>
When she alighted from her carriage at the top, Bates wrote later, she stood 
still for "an ecstatic moment" drinking in "the most glorious scenery I ever 
beheld." 
</P>
<P>
"As I was looking out over the sealike expanse of fertile country spreading 
away so far under those ample skies," Bates recalled afterward, "the opening 
lines of the hymn floated into my mind . . . Oh beautiful for spacious skies, 
for amber waves of grain. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Katharine Lee Bates (1859-1929) is well remembered in the environs of 
Pikes Peak. If you stop to visit the campus of Colorado College, a lovely green 
oasis near the heart of downtown Colorado Springs, you can see a mural honoring 
her poem in the school's Shove Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
And in the small gift shop/rest house at the top of the mountain, there's an 
author's holograph of "America the Beautiful" in Bates's own hand. 
</P>
<P>
If you're traveling from the West to Pikes Peak, you'll probably stop in Denver 
and then drive the 70 miles to Colorado Springs. If the sky is clear -- a rare 
occurrence in Denver these days -- you'll see the Peak poking its snowy face 
skyward due south of Denver airport as your plane comes in to land. 
</P>
<P>
Driving south along Interstate 25, you'll begin to get marvelous vistas of the 
majestic mountain about 20 miles out of Denver. For my money, the view from the 
north is the most dramatic way to see Pikes Peak. 
</P>
<P>
The great white mountain (it is snow-covered about 42 weeks of the year) 
hunkers there on the horizon like a great white whale, its long ridge rising 
gradually to the sharp peak. 
</P>
<P>
Just north of Colorado Springs, I-25 skirts the campus of the U.S. Air Force 
Academy, nestled in against the jagged hills of the Rampart Range on the 
eastern slope of the Rockies. There's a well-marked overlook here that offers a 
stunning view of the eastern face of the Peak, the face that Zebulon Pike first 
saw from his vantage point out on the plains. 
</P>
<P>
When you reach Colorado Springs, it's a 10-minute drive westward on Route 24 to 
the little tourist town of Manitou Springs, where most of the routes up Pikes 
Peak begin. 
</P>
<P>
Intrepid hikers might choose to trek to the top on the Barr Trail, a 
well-marked but extremely demanding hiking route laid out by Fred Barr from 
1914 to 1918. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Forest Service, thousands of people start the trip every year 
and a few hundred finish it. It's roughly 12 miles of hiking -- no technical 
climbing required -- with some incredibly steep sections and scores of 
switchbacks. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people turn back early, because the first four miles are quite tough, 
and down there below timberline there's not much view of the peak. Those hikers 
who make it all the way generally plan on a two-day round trip, with a stopover 
at Barr Camp, four miles and 4,000 feet below the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Among the regular hikers are the members of Colorado Springs' Ad-Am-An (i.e., 
"add a man") Club. This fraternal organization adds one member each year. The 
neophyte must pass initiation by climbing to the top on New Year's Eve, when 
the club sets off an annual fireworks display that can be seen for 50 miles in 
all directions. 
</P>
<P>
Manitou Springs is the boarding point for the Pikes Peak Cog Railway, an 
electric train with two bright red cars that follow a surprisingly straight 
track to the top. Round-trip fare is $17 for adults, $8 for people between 5 
and 11 years old; preschoolers ride free. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular means of ascent these days is the Pikes Peak Highway, a 
serpentine 20-mile toll road that is paved for the first seven miles and then 
becomes reasonably smooth gravel. This is a steep and occasionally terrifying 
driving experience, but most two-wheel-drive family cars can make it. It's open 
from May to October each year. 
</P>
<P>
At the toll gate, you'll be charged $14 for a family of four. The rangers there 
offer driving tips: Don't use your air conditioning; it will make hard-working 
engines overheat. Stop now and then on the way down to let your brakes cool 
off. 
</P>
<P>
To enforce that last rule, there is frequently a policeman stationed about five 
miles below the summit to feel each car's wheels and warn motorists whose 
brakes are overheated. The best time to go is in the morning, because the 
summit can be hazy or completely fogged in on summer afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
The drive up Pikes Peak is one of the loveliest auto trips you can imagine, 
particularly above timberline (11,500 feet in Colorado), where the views seem 
to spread out forever and the mountainside becomes a vast white sea of snow.

<P>
Iles-de-la-Madeleine. The name conjures up images of beauty and gentleness. And 
this remote 12-island archipelago 50 miles into the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 
easternmost Quebec lives up to its romantic name. 
</P>
<P>
Here are no hotel chains, no crowds and no crime -- only miles of sand dunes 
that interlace many of the islands and create calm inland lagoons. 
</P>
<P>
In summer, the hills are strewn with wild berries. Richly painted frame houses 
look to the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the islands' 15,000 inhabitants, known as Madelinots, are the 
French-speaking descendants of farmers and fishermen who settled the area in 
the 17th Century. Roads on the natural dune bridges make touring the islands a 
breeze, by bus, car, or -- as we did -- by bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
From Cap-aux-Meules, we took daily excursions with 10 other cyclists, ages 30 
to 50. We averaged 35 miles a day, the easy pace and terrain making it 
comfortable for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
The bicycle package included a number of extra activities, such as a theatrical 
performance, evenings of jazz and island folk songs, horseback riding on the 
beach and a plane ride over the islands. 
</P>
<P>
But cycling was our mainstay. We saw the wooden sculpture commemorating Jacques 
Cartier's arrival in the islands in 1534, and St. Peter's By the Sea Church -- 
an Anglican building framed from the wood of the shipwreck "Cargo." 
</P>
<P>
Our guides from Sunset Bicyle Tours pointed out the experimental windmills on 
Havre-aux-Maisons (they looked like eggbeaters), and on Havre Aubert we visited 
the charming Museum of the Sea, with its history of the islands and their 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
We looked into some shops, too, such as Francois Turbide's, where he practices 
the art of glass blowing, or one on Havre Aubert that featured items sculpted 
in sand from island beaches. A favorite was a quaint boutique with a sandy 
floor and a window to the sea carved in the fragile red sandstone bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
We were always near the water. The open sea, bays and lagoons provided ideal 
conditions for swimming and other water sports. We noticed a school where 
beginners could take up windsurfing. Best of all were the beaches -- white, 
wide and strewn only with shells brought in by the tide. Cliffs shelter the 
beautiful Dune du Sud beach, where, we were told, at low tide one can explore 
caves along the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
The dunes make a playground of Plage de la Grande Echouerie on Grosse Ile, also 
one of the best sites for view seals. We followed the beach to a point called 
Old Harry, where Europeans founded a walrus-hunting station and established a 
Continental presence on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Acadian farmers and fishermen eventually colonized the archipelago. The first 
Europeans to explore and lay claim to the St. Lawrence River, the French 
protected the region around the river's entrance. They called the land to the 
south of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, known today as Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick, Acadie. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, its position made Acadie a strategic point in the ensuing struggle 
between the English and French for control of the waterway. Wishing only to 
farm, fish and live peacefully with the friendly Micmac Indians, the Acadians 
were not involved in the war. Still, the English demanded that they pledge 
allegiance to England or suffer exile. 
</P>
<P>
Some escaped to the north; others who had come from Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, 
now Newfoundland, began life anew in the Iles-de-la-Madeleine. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the islands' inhabitants speak French today. 
</P>
<P>
On the outer island of Ile d'Entree, however, the common language is English. 
We took the 45-minute ferry ride from Cap-aux-Meules to visit the colony of 200 
fishermen and their families. It was like discovering yet another new land. We 
followed footpaths through the fragrant fields of irises and wild roses that 
encircle the tiny isle. It was difficult to grasp the harsh and isolated lives 
that these islanders lead, but easy to sense the freedom that they love. 
</P>
<P>
The Madelinots are warm and gracious hosts. Many open their homes to visitors, 
renting out rooms and cottages, but only one place on Ile d'Entree offers room 
and board, so anyone wishing to stay the night should make early reservation. 
We found the accommodations on the other islands, and the meals of fresh 
seafood, uniformly first-class. La Table des Roy, La Maison de Rosee and 
L'Hotel au Vieux Couvent combine atmosphere with exquisite French cuisine that 
would rival any big-city restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"Pot-en-pot" and bouillabaisse are regional seafood dishes, and lobster is an 
affordable luxury here -- only $7 at the Cooperative de Gros-Cap.

CONSUMER REPORT: TRAVELERS USING AGENTS HAVE ENTERED A BRAVE NEW WORLD OF 
SERVICE FEES; 
</P>
<P>
BOOKINGS: THOSE DAYS OF ALWAYS GETTING SOMETHING FOR NOTHING FROM AGENTS IS 
CHANGING. CHARGES FOR SOME SERVICES ARE BECOMING MORE COMMONPLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Some consumers are discovering that a growing number of travel agencies are 
likely to charge for some types of services that were once "free." 
</P>
<P>
Travel agents derive their income from commissions -- usually from airlines, 
cruise lines, hotels and car-rental companies. 
</P>
<P>
But they don't make money from reissuing airline tickets, handling 
frequent-flier coupons and delivering tickets. Since these activities represent 
no income or low earnings, agents may assess service fees to cover the time 
spent in performing such work. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, service fees are applied to the cost of the travel arrangements 
booked. Agents may also waive service fees in various situations and for good 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of service fees is a controversial one among agencies. And as 
agents clash over marketing philosophy, consumers can expect to face a service 
fee for assorted agency activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Travel agencies with street-front locations are the ones most likely to assess 
service fees because of the tremendous amount of walk-in traffic they get," 
said Linda Hutson, owner of Ferguson Gates Travel in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to a service charge is to compensate ourselves for labor on 
nonprofitable items," Martha Scott, manager of Glendale Travel, said. "While 
travel agencies are in a service business, we're not nonprofit organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Larchmont Travel is an agency that has held off levying fees 
in the past, but has now instituted a service fee of $5 for processing airline 
promotional coupons that clients bring in. 
</P>
<P>
"Handling these coupons is time-consuming and they mean less income for the 
agency since the value of the ticket is less and so is our commission from the 
airline," said general manager Sam Gentz. 
</P>
<P>
Gentz predicted more travel agencies will likely institute some service fees in 
the future. "It's basic economics. This is one business in which the harder you 
work the less you make. You can spend hours looking for the lowest fares, which 
then mean less income. Agencies are taking a realistic look at imposing more 
service fees." 
</P>
<P>
All About Travel in Northridge has just instituted a $25-per-hour nonrefundable 
service fee for arranging customized itineraries. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we had a nonrefundable $100 deposit that could be applied to the 
trip," said Pat Campbell, manager of the agency and former chairperson of the 
Association of Retail Travel Agencies, a major trade group. "But too much time 
can be taken with these arrangements and we have to cover our costs." 
</P>
<P>
Potential clients are advised up front of the hourly charge for this service, 
and given an estimate of the likely amount of time needed. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, for one, doesn't believe in assessing a service fee for handling 
promotional coupons. "The fee is insignificant and it could scare people away," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell also predicted that more travel agencies would implement some kind of 
service fees in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Travel agents are more business-oriented today than in the past, and they tend 
to look more at the bottom line. If they don't get paid enough by the suppliers 
to cover their costs, they'll pass the cost on to the consumer. It's a natural 
evolution." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Travel has a brochure on each desk explaining its fees. Some examples: 
$10 for handling frequent-flier and other promotional coupons, and reissuing 
airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"We might sell someone a ticket for $300, the fare goes down to $200 and the 
client comes back to us to reissue the ticket," Scott said. "Whether we reissue 
the ticket or the airline does it, we still lose some of our commission from 
the airline. But if we do the work, we may charge a $10 service fee to cover 
our time." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Glendale Travel may assess $10 for a hotel booking, if there is no 
airline booking with it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's because the chance of our getting a commission from some hotels is 
slim," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we book a cruise or a tour, we ask for a nonrefundable service fee of $25. 
This amount is applied to the final payment of the client. Then if the person 
changes their mind, we still have something to show for our work." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the delivery of tickets, visas or other documents to the client's 
home or office will incur a fee. "We have free delivery within our normal 
marketing area, but we might charge $25 to $50 for a staff member to drive 
farther afield," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
A $50 fee is also charged for hard-to-make holiday bookings and reservations 
for special bargain offerings that require a good deal of phone calls and staff 
time. "Of this amount, $25 is applied to the cost of the arrangements and we 
keep $25 as our fee for the special work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On the upper end of the scale, for clients seeking a customized tour, Glendale 
Travel charges a $100 nonrefundable service fee that is applied to the trip. 
Clients are charged the actual cost of any telexes and other communications, 
with no mark-up. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Travel also charges service fees of $10 for all air fares sold for 
under $100, and for any record search in agency files. "It's very seldom that 
we actually ask for the air-fare fee," she said. "We figure if the fare is that 
low, we'll get lots of business through it." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like plenty of potential service fees, but when it comes down to it, 
Scott says, the agency generally waives fees for repeat clients. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always a judgment call," she said. "We're much more likely to charge a 
fee to someone who walks in off the street who we haven't dealt with before. We 
can also tell when someone is just shopping around and not really ready to go 
ahead with specific travel arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
Does the agency lose business by charging such service fees? 
</P>
<P>
"We debated this issue but decided that while we might lose some people, they 
were the kind worth losing," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our experience is that people tend to respect our professionalism more when 
they understand that our time represents money, too. I think travel agents who 
are afraid to charge service fees don't respect their own professionalism." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, consumers should understand that not all agencies are the same. Some 
agencies are full-service, others may specialize in low-cost travel and not 
offer a full range of services. And some are cruise-only agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Don't assume that you'll get every service just because you give your business 
to an agency. For example, a full-service agency is much more likely to contact 
you about changes in flight schedules after you've purchased a ticket than will 
a "low-frill" agency. 
</P>
<P>
Agencies should alert you right away about any service fees they might charge, 
either verbally or in writing. Make sure that you understand when such fees are 
applied to the bookings you actually make.

Recent developments along the U.S.-Mexico border highlight the continuing 
controversy and volatile emotions swirling around undocumented immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, we visited the Los Angeles and San Diego areas to assess how the 
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 had affected the volume of 
undocumented immigrants coming into this country. More recently, we have heard 
discussions about using a San Diego SWAT team to protect undocumented 
immigrants. We have also learned of the Alliance for Border Control's "Light Up 
the Border" protests against the continuing flow of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
It is understandable that communities most directly affected by a problem will 
strive for immediate answers. But neither initiative will have any effect on 
the causes nor the long-term implications of undocumented immigration. 
Americans have long relied on short-term enforcement measures to control 
immigration. Only recently have long-term efforts been undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its employer sanctions and amnesty provisions, the immigration 
act created the Commission for the Study of International Migration and 
Cooperative Economic Development. Its task was to study the conditions that 
give rise to undocumented immigration from Mexico and other countries in the 
Western Hemisphere and to recommend "mutually beneficial . . . trade and 
investment" measures to alleviate them. 
</P>
<P>
In its report, issued Tuesday, the commission found that although there are 
other important factors, the search for economic opportunity is the primary 
reason that unauthorized immigrants come to the United States. This is 
particularly true for Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, while job-creating economic growth is the ultimate solution to 
reducing such migratory pressures, it tends, in the short-to-medium term, to 
add to these pressures by raising expectations and enhancing people's ability 
to migrate. Still, it is the only way to keep workers from crossing borders in 
search of greater economic opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Toward this end, the commission made numerous recommendations. It is clear that 
the migrant-sending countries must be primarily responsible for creating 
economic opportunity for their own people. Mexico and other countries have 
launched ambitious economic programs to accomplish this. But the United States 
must adjust certain policies, especially on trade, to help these countries 
sustain economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Expanded access to the markets of the United States and other industrialized 
nations through increasingly free trade is the most promising stimulus to 
future economic growth in Mexico and other migrant-sending countries. Mexico 
shares this belief. All year, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been 
saying "we must export goods, or we will continue indefinitely to export 
people" in his push for free trade between Mexico and the United States. During 
his visit to Washington in June, he and President Bush agreed to prepare for 
trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas' free-trade proposal was motivated, in part, by his concern that 
developments in both Eastern and Western Europe may divert the attention and 
resources of the industrialized countries away from Mexico -- and the rest of 
Latin America and the Caribbean. The United States may be similarly affected, 
though President Bush's recent proposals on Latin American trade, investment 
and debt issues hold out the prospect of a North American and, eventually, 
hemisphere-wide free-trade zone. Private business organizations such as the 
Council of the Americas, the U.S.-Mexico Business Council and the Assn. of 
American Chambers of Commerce in Latin America are working on this. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants, the commission reported, have consistently rejuvenated and 
revitalized American society, and they will continue to do so. But the plight 
of undocumented immigrants who, forced by economic or other circumstances to 
seek better lives away from home, are almost by definition subject to 
exploitation is worrisome. The constant violation of our laws implicit in the 
continuing flow of undocumented immigrants into the United States is equally 
troubling. It was the commission's hope that fostering growth in 
migrant-sending countries would eliminate the need to enforce our immigration 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States, as Salinas has implied, is in the unenviable 
position of having to choose between accepting goods and services from its 
southern neighbors that may temporarily affect our own domestic industry and 
labor force, or of countenancing unauthorized traffic in human beings that 
harms our laws, our communities and our resources. While there are other 
remedies, trade is the only short-term alternative that offers hope to people 
in a region characterized by a broad spectrum of economic growth. Financial 
assistance, even if it were available in the amounts needed, would not be 
nearly as effective. Moreover, expanded trade with hemispheric nations should 
produce more jobs and greater prosperity in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
President Salinas' proposal for free trade between the United States and Mexico 
and President Bush's broader initiative on Latin American trade, investment and 
debt issues are worthy of support. But this support must recognize the major 
paradox reported by the commission -- that economic development tends, at 
first, to stimulate migration. Judgment on the success of economic growth as a 
solution to unauthorized immigration must thus be withheld for decades. 
</P>
<P>
If the United States is to cooperate with migrant-sending countries in a 
long-term search to solve the immigration problem, it must be steadfast in 
purpose and dedication over a great many years. If this is understood, the 
commission will have fulfilled its mandate, and the flow of undocumented 
immigrants will gradually diminish as more and better jobs are created for them 
at home.

ABORTION: BY PICKING A JUDICIAL -- AS OPPOSED TO A POLITICAL -- CONSERVATIVE, 
BUSH MAY HAVE PRESERVED SOME ELEMENTS OF ROE VS. WADE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Not surprisingly, abortion has come to the fore as the test of President George 
Bush's Supreme Court nominee, David H. Souter. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana recently passed a statute banning abortions except in the case of 
rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. Although Gov. Buddy Roemer vetoed 
it, the statute could resurface in another form and could end up on the Supreme 
Court's docket in 1992 -- the eve of the presidential election. Whatever the 
fate of the Louisiana or any other statute limiting abortion, it is certain 
that the next court will decide the abortion question for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Some polls show support as high as 70% for some degree of abortion rights, but 
the lingering power of "values conservatives" has prevented Bush from endorsing 
a nominee who holds that view. The challenge to the President was to head off a 
bruising fight in the U.S. Senate without alienating his base. 
</P>
<P>
The solution was Souter, a New Hampshire State Supreme Court Justice for seven 
years and a federal judge on the First Circuit for a bare four months. He had 
not yet participated in any of the circuit's decisions. His years in New 
Hampshire provide only the most general hints of his constitutional views, 
since the New Hampshire court tends not to divide along ideological grounds. 
</P>
<P>
So what are we to make of Souter? By all accounts, he has sterling intellectual 
credentials and seems to have bipartisan respect, if not support. He is clearly 
conservative, but apparently not dogmatically so. Indeed, he seems a quaintly 
old-fashioned sort of judge, free of ideological pre-commitments, conservative 
with a small "c" in his dedication to tight legal reasoning and scrupulous, 
rather technical readings of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Souter was apparently deeply influenced by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' 
philosophy of legal positivism, which held that there was no natural law -- law 
was only that which was handed down by the lawgiver. The role of the judge was 
to interpret the decrees of the lawgiver, rather than refer to abstract moral 
principles. The result of such a view is deference to the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Souter is a conservative in a conservative era. It may be that like 
Holmes, a liberal in a progressive era, Souter's politics are well-served by 
his philosophy. But his temperament, too, seems to be a cautious one, said to 
be given to listening carefully to all sides of a conflict. He once answered a 
question about his views on judicial activism by essentially saying that 
activism was appropriate in those cases that called for it, and not in those 
cases that didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Souter seems to have an inherent sense of the limits of his power -- 
he primarily seeks to solve the concrete problem in front of him, with a 
minimum of additional discussion. He is not a man who will aim his rhetoric at 
posterity. One law professor was quoted as saying of Souter: "He's against 
abortion, and I'm sure he thinks Roe vs. Wade was wrongly decided. What is 
impossible to measure is whether he's prepared to overturn a Supreme Court 
precedent. I think his thinking would be that he would not, unless he felt it 
was egregiously wrong." 
</P>
<P>
In a 1986 medical malpractice case, Souter joined a unanimous opinion allowing 
a woman to sue her obstetrician for failing to warn her that a case of measles 
during her pregnancy had put her in substantial risk of bearing a child with 
severe birth defects. Had she known, the woman asserted, she would have had 
prenatal testing and perhaps an abortion. In allowing the suit, the court held 
that the physician may have violated his duty to his patient. 
</P>
<P>
Souter also submitted a separate concurring opinion, expressing concern over 
how a physician with moral scruples against abortions could discharge his duty 
properly. He implied that "timely disclosure of professional limits based on 
religious or moral scruples, combined with timely referral to other physicians 
not so constrained" could possibly provide a valid defense. 
</P>
<P>
But because the question of physician's scruples was not raised in the case 
before him, Souter made no definite statement on the issue, saying only that it 
was "a question open for consideration in any case in which it may be raised." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the posture of the abortion cases that come before a Justice Souter 
will be crucial to the outcome of his decision. He will not decide more than 
what is there; he will not reach beyond the specific legal question presented 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Souter seems less a man who would overrule Roe than one who will interpret it, 
in every sense of the word "interpret" -- chipping away in some places, and 
just possibly expanding in others, all depending on the precise constitutional 
question of the case before him at that time. 
</P>
<P>
If Souter does participate in overruling Roe, it will not be because he himself 
is opposed to abortion, or because he is a conservative in the voting booth, 
but because he views Roe as a violation of his strict constructionist ideas. 
Paradoxically, it is not his politics that liberals should fear, but his legal 
philosophy. Even Roe proponents concede the legal weaknesses of the decision, 
and those legal weaknesses would make Roe vulnerable to Souter's hyper-logical 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, though less likely, Souter may even be such a strict 
constructionist that he will be loath to overturn any precedent. The most 
genuinely conservative aspect of Souter seems to be his steady refusal to 
exercise judicial power beyond what he deems its proper limits. Curiously, by 
selecting a judicial conservative -- as opposed to a merely political 
conservative -- Bush may have, wittingly or not, preserved at least some 
elements of the right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
It may be, of course, that Souter will turn out to be a revolutionary on the 
court. William J. Brennan Jr., after all, was an appointee of Dwight D. 
Eisenhower. But the assessment here is based more on Souter's character than on 
his politics; after a monastic lifetime of scrupulous caution, it seems 
unlikely that he will be transformed overnight into a Robespierre.

In one sense, Bush is right in saying that abortion should not be the sole 
litmus test for a Supreme Court nominee. The more fundamental concern is the 
importance of the process itself, by which ideas are formed and given their 
hearing. Souter's hero Holmes saw this, stating: "A Constitution is made for 
people of fundamentally differing opinions." Brennan, when interviewed about 
the possibility of conservative appointments to the Court, replied, "We're a 
democracy. The only way the citizens can have their views felt nationally is 
through the Congress and the President. That's our system." 
</P>
<P>
Souter, it is said, has a true conservative's deep respect for precedent and 
institutional integrity. Given the restraint that marks his character, one 
hopes his hand will not weigh too heavily on any one side of the scales of 
justice.

THE OBSCURE NOMINEE; 
</P>
<P>
SUPREME COURT: THE SELECTION USED TO BE A VERY PERSONAL DECISION OF THE 
PRESIDENT. TODAY, POLITICALLY SENSITIVE ADVISERS DO THE JOB.

<P>
Far from bold leadership, President George Bush made a cautiously calculated 
choice in naming Judge David H. Souter to succeed Justice William J. Brennan 
Jr. The President knows that virtually anyone he might nominate will push the 
U.S. Supreme Court in even more sharply conservative directions on abortion, 
affirmative action and a few other issues where Brennan has been able to 
maintain bare majorities in support of individual rights. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Bush distanced himself from his popular predecessor by disclaiming 
that his nominee passed any "litmus test." Whereas Ronald Reagan made 
judgeships symbols and instruments of his presidential power, Bush aims to 
avoid conflict and win reelection. Like other past Republican Presidents in 
political trouble and confronted with making a tough appointment, Bush appeals 
to the professionalism of his obscure nominee. In short, Bush punts. 
</P>
<P>
The President, to be sure, contrived to inspire confidence by announcing his 
choice just three days after Brennan brought to an end 34 years of service on 
the court. Few Presidents have moved so quickly. Most wait a month or more 
before announcing their decisions. But Lyndon B. Johnson holds the record for 
speed: He named his solicitor general, Thurgood Marshall, just a day after 
Justice Tom C. Clark resigned. 
</P>
<P>
At their own peril, Presidents race ahead before fully checking their nominees' 
qualifications and backgrounds. Reagan learned that in 1987, when searching to 
replace retiring Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. At the time, Powell was considered 
pivotal, because he cast the crucial vote for upholding abortion and 
affirmative-action programs. Unlike Bush, however, Reagan stuck to his 
ideological guns. After the Senate overwhelmingly rejected his first nominee, 
Judge Robert H. Bork, the President hastily pressed ahead by naming Judge 
Douglas H. Ginsburg, instead of the low-key and solidly conservative federal 
Judge Anthony M. Kennedy. Only when Ginsburg was forced to withdraw, amid 
revelations that he had smoked marijuana, did Reagan settle on Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
However swift, Bush's move also lacks the self-assurance of a Reagan or a 
Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1937, F.D.R. retaliated against the court for 
overturning, by 5-4 votes, much of his New Deal program. He proposed to enlarge 
the number of justices from nine to 15, thereby securing a majority favorable 
to him. Then, surprisingly, a justice changed his mind and the court upheld, by 
a 5-4 margin, major pieces of New Deal legislation. That contributed to the 
Senate's defeat of his "court-packing plan," but F.D.R. remained vindictive and 
committed to turning the court in new directions. When he got the first of 
eight chances to fill vacancies, Roosevelt named Sen. Hugo L. Black, who had 
led the fight for the court expansion and was one of the court's sharpest 
critics. Unlike Bush, Roosevelt was not content to "let things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, moreover, runs the risk that something unexpected about Souter may turn 
up. He is banking on the investigation conducted by the American Bar Assn. six 
months ago, when Bush put Souter on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First 
Circuit. Souter was rated "well qualified." 
</P>
<P>
But Richard M. Nixon made that mistake by too quickly jumping to G. Harrold 
Carswell in 1970. Although sailing through the confirmation process to a seat 
on the appellate bench, Carswell was roasted in the Senate when shortly after 
his nomination to the court, certain racist speeches he'd made decades earlier 
were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
While denying that his nominee is "Bush-league," the President nevertheless 
picked a little known (and hence presumably non-controversial) conservative. In 
passing over more qualified and experienced candidates, he feared the 
possibility of his and their becoming embroiled in a heated debate over 
abortion and other emotional social issues. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Bush the first to adopt such a tactic. John F. Kennedy elevated Arthur 
J. Goldberg and Byron R. White from within the ranks of his Administration over 
more qualified jurists. When trying to fill a vacancy in 1930, Herbert H. 
Hoover picked an ostensibly non-controversial conservative appellate judge, 
John J. Parker, over the widely respected Benjamin N. Cardozo. But controversy 
soon erupted over Parker's record and potential hostility toward blacks and 
labor. Following Parker's embarrassing defeat, Hoover was virtually forced to 
give Cardozo his next appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Souter may indeed offer Bush a politically expedient way of avoiding political 
conflict. At age 50, single and on the federal bench fewer than four months, he 
has written no opinions for liberals or conservatives to scrutinize. That was 
undoubtedly attractive to Bush, but that is not all there is to his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Souter's nomination reflects fundamental changes in the politics of judicial 
selection and of the American presidency. Once the selection of Supreme Court 
nominees was a very personal decision of the President. That was the practice 
of presidents in the 19th Century and down through the last appointment to the 
court by a Democratic President 23 years ago. Winning the presidential nod, as 
Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone put it, was like winning a "lottery" in which the 
President handpicked his favorite from a pool of more-or-less qualified 
individuals. This practice generally worked well, though some of F.D.R.'s and 
Harry S. Truman's appointees were not very good. Besides, Presidents at least 
had personal knowledge of their nominees and how they might reasonably perform 
on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
With the growth of the institutionalized presidency, however, Presidents have 
increasingly delegated more responsibility for judicial selection to their 
subordinates. Not only do their advisers have greater influence; they make 
politically calculated recommendations on who should be appointed and how a 
nominee will benefit the President and his party. No Republican President since 
William H. Taft has been deeply and personally involved in making his 
nominations to the court. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was no exception. While he only met Souter for the first time just two 
days before announcing his nomination, Souter had an inside track because of 
his friendship with the President's chief of staff, John H. Sununu. As governor 
of New Hampshire, in 1982, Sununu elevated Souter to that state's Supreme 
Court. Last year, Sununu prevailed on Bush to give Souter a seat on the federal 
appellate bench. With little personal knowledge of his nominee, Bush accepts 
Sununu's judgment and asks supporters to again read his lips. 
</P>
<P>
When compared with other Presidents, Bush's strategy is almost a replay of 
Gerald R. Ford's 1975 appointment of Justice John Paul Stevens. Then, as now, 
the court was poised to change dramatically due to Nixon's four previous 
appointments. When William O. Douglas' seat opened up, the justices were often 
divided 5-4 or 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Ford's advisers were sharply split over who he should appoint. One 
faction pushed for a woman; another championed Bork. But Ford feared a bitter 
confirmation battle over a controversial conservative nominee. So he named 
Stevens, a moderately conservative and relatively unknown federal judge. Women 
were disappointed and conservatives continue to chafe at Ford's choice, but 
Stevens sailed through the confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
Like Ford and unlike Reagan, Bush passed up an opportunity to make a 
politically bold and symbolic appointment by naming a woman, a black, a Latino, 
or a well-known conservative. Clearly, Bush cares more about the short run than 
the court's long-term future and its impact on American politics.

REFLECTIONS ON A BEACH BLANKET: WESTERNERS PREFER A LITTLE DISTANCE; 
</P>
<P>
CUSTOMS: CALIFORNIANS FLEE CITIES TO FIND PRIVACY OUTDOORS; EASTERNERS GO ON 
VACATION TO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER, WHICH THEY DON'T OFTEN DO IN CITIES.

Porpoises ply the waters off both the New Jersey shore and California coast, 
but the similarities between the populations inhabiting the two seashores end 
there. Even beachgoers differ in the way they lay their blankets down. 
Westerners prefer to sit apart. Easterners tend to self-congest, on narrow 
strands of sand where all the action is. Perfectly ordinary habits carry 
implications, conveying in this instance why cities differ from coast to coast. 
Big cities like those of the East have little place in the growing West. 
</P>
<P>
The first boardwalk in the United States was constructed in Cape May, N.J., to 
facilitate masses of beachgoers lying cheek to cheek, their umbrellas -- rented 
from nearby kiosks -- bumping up against each other. It remains that way today. 
Beach tags are required within the city limits, at 10 bucks a season -- cheap 
compared with ski lifts, I suppose. The tag inspector walks the sand, checking 
out swimsuits, to ensure tags are all displayed under penalty of law. It's a 
cushy job, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few miles away at Poverty Beach or at the lighthouse to the south, 
beaches are sparsely populated. Instead, the loons and herons gather in nearby 
marshes, unobserved except for birders. There's no place to promenade or 
interrupt a tanning session with arcades, crab cakes and fries. 
</P>
<P>
There's a certain love of tackiness about the Jersey shore. People like to 
cluster, buy gaudy trinkets and digest fried fat. They like to promenade and 
eat. It's not just Jersey, though. It's that way up and down the eastern 
seaboard. It's also true in Europe, where kilometers of deserted beaches are 
punctuated by mobs of huddled masses. 
</P>
<P>
I prefer the interstices between resorts, avoiding boardwalks and the crowds. A 
California favorite of mine is Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, just north of 
Big Sur State Park. At the end of an obscure road dotted with turnouts and 
potholes lies one of the world's most spectacular beaches, with waves crashing 
through windows in the rocks, seals, gulls and sand dunes. People visit there 
in families or with friends -- or even by themselves -- tranquilized by nature 
rather than kiosks and arcades. 
</P>
<P>
At the northern end of Pfeiffer Beach, farthest from the road, some sunbathe in 
the nude. And lovers occasionally seek out its isolation. Those who engage in 
sandy acts of intimacy are not always exhibitionists. They simply look at 
nature as a place for privacy. Those who find their privacy behind apartment 
doors in eastern cities crowd together on sidewalks, city squares and 
boardwalks. Californians take their cities very differently, as public places 
to retreat from, finding privacy in the Great Outdoors. Easterners, on the 
other hand, gather on vacation to talk with one another the way they would not 
often do in the cities where they live. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't really that surprising that people on vacation take a vacation from 
themselves -- Westerners withdraw and Easterners engage. But there's more to 
this than that. As the population shifts from east to west, city life is 
changing too. That change is worth considering as the model American 
megalopolis becomes Los Angeles, rather than New York. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern urban anonymity was built against a background of community. As the 
communities began to fray, anonymity took over, but the premise still remains 
that everyone is part of things. The homeless and the rich are both New 
Yorkers. With lessened stress from being on vacation, eastern urban dwellers 
return to their native state again, feeling openly comfortable in crowds. So, 
they congregate in bunches on beaches or promenade on the boardwalk. The same 
thing can be seen in cafes of Paris or piazzas of Italy. This is the way most 
European cities and those modeled after them work. All such city dwellers see 
themselves as members of a club, whether it be in Boston, Mexico City or 
Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
Things are different in Southern California, where the big-city concept does 
not hold. Orange County, for example, has no central city. Los Angeles is, at 
best, a holding company for several different towns, from Westwood to Highland 
Park. The Los Angeles City Council is not the council of a city but only a 
committee representing different interest groups, a smaller version of Los 
Angeles County's Board of Supervisors. City Hall is more a landmark than a seat 
of political power. 
</P>
<P>
As Angelenos and Orange County residents lay their blankets down, their 
tendency to lie apart is symptomatic of an inner distance they've achieved. 
There is no common city they're a member of. Only on the outskirts of Los 
Angeles do real towns remain, like Santa Barbara and Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
It is one thing to be a part of a larger whole that is fragmenting, such as the 
fate faced by New Yorkers or suburbanites commuting to a dying urban center. It 
is quite another to distance yourself from city identity altogether, not to be 
a member of the city where you live. It is this second model that's currently 
evolving in Southern California, counties without centers, cities without 
hearts. Instead of a European model for city life and city ways, in Southern 
California we have created a rather different scene, of neighborhoods and 
counties, without big cities in between. 
</P>
<P>
This is an important difference between Southern California and the rest of the 
urban world. Once beach-blanket implications sink into consciousness, new 
opportunities can be seized for solving urban problems. Big city government can 
be de-emphasized in favor of neighborhood councils and regional and county 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and Orange counties are closer to each other philosophically than 
either would dare admit. This offers a solution for our future in Southern 
California and other places, too. By abandoning the illusion that we live in 
one big city, we might be able to get things done which can't be done back 
East, as we retain a sense of local neighborhood while living regionally.

'ECONOMIC GAP BODES ILL FOR U.S.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the first in a series on "Poverty in America" the statement by the 
article's authors that most Americans are unmoved by the poverty within their 
country and that "Americans as a society apparently have chosen to tolerate 
this level of poverty" is an astounding misinterpretation of the facts. A more 
accurate assessment of the situation would be that most Americans, themselves 
living so close to the edge, are gravely concerned about the plight of those 
less fortunate among us, but are at a loss as to how to deal with so monumental 
a problem. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, whenever this nation has been faced with a crisis of such grave 
proportions, citizens looked to the federal and state governments for the 
leadership to solve such problems. Today, Americans have come to realize that 
many of the officials currently walking the hallowed halls of our state and 
federal capitals are the problem. These officeholders are totally out of touch 
with the general population and as a result, they continue funding programs the 
American people don't want. 
</P>
<P>
One of the only solutions to this problem is for people to vote those whom they 
feel do not represent them out of office. Unfortunately, most Americans don't 
believe their vote counts for much these days.

HOUSING BEYOND SHELTER; 
</P>
<P>
NOVEL SAN FRANCISCO PLAN OFFERS HOUSING PLUS OTHER NEEDED SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos is taking impressive steps to help homeless men, 
women and children get off the streets and into safe, decent and affordable 
housing. His ambitious plan -- if financed as designed -- will provide 
temporary shelters, treatment centers, transitional housing and permanent 
housing. The program, appropriately called Beyond Shelter, deserves support 
and, where possible, duplication. 
</P>
<P>
Homelessness is not an abstract concept for Agnos, a former social worker who 
spent years working with very poor people. After becoming mayor, he needed only 
to look out of the window to see homeless people camping on a park in front of 
City Hall. Police cleared that area earlier this month, but only after the city 
opened two new multipurpose centers, the heart and soul of the new system. 
</P>
<P>
These shelters -- patterned in part after the successful Weingart Center on 
Skid Row in Los Angeles -- offer a cot, a hot meal, a shower and a wide array 
of services. The homeless men -- called "guests" -- can take advantage of 
counseling, job training, drug or alcohol assistance and can apply for 
benefits. The counselors work together although they may represent competing 
programs or different levels of government. That is an uncommon but useful 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
The shelters have a 30-day limit, but any counselor can extend the stay of a 
"guest" who is making progress. Other rules are designed to include rather than 
exclude homeless people. Men who have alcohol on their breath -- an 
unforgivable offense at typical shelters -- are allowed to stay. 
</P>
<P>
To fight the NIMBY philosophy, the men are not allowed to line up outside of 
the shelters, and the city has provided extra police protection and street 
cleaning in the area. 
</P>
<P>
At the mayor's urging, the Red Cross provided $5.4 million from earthquake 
relief funds to pay for the shelters' leases. The state is paying operating 
costs. Agnos is also asking the business community for help. Pacific Telesis 
has promised to fund a shelter for families, but Beyond Shelter also calls for 
a large detoxification center, a transitional shelter, a novel community 
detention facility and more affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos isn't claiming that his plan will get all the homeless off the streets, 
but if it works there, the obvious question is: Will it work elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco has certain advantages. It is a compact city. The homeless 
population is only about 6,000 people. San Francisco combines its city and 
county governments, so the mayor can demand quick cooperation between the 
county, the provider of last resort, and the city, which has expertise in 
housing. Such cooperation is difficult in Los Angeles, but worth a try. 
</P>
<P>
Most homeless men and women need more than housing to get off the streets. 
Beyond Shelter holds out that promise in San Francisco.

THE GREAT FRIED POTATO REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the end of this year more than 18,000 McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's 
restaurants in the United States will be serving french fries cooked wholly in 
vegetable oil, instead of their customary mixture of beef tallow and oil. With 
this single step, long urged by nutritionists and health-conscious consumers, a 
traditional junk food will lose much of its junk, leaving a more nutritious 
dish that contains 45% less saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, American arteries will be better for that. But now to the question that 
burns in the minds of millions who enjoy those french fries just as they are: 
How will they taste? 
</P>
<P>
They worked on it -- McDonald's spent eight years on research -- and now they 
say they have the answers. The taste will be "preserved," a McDonald's official 
says. We'll see. 
</P>
<P>
But greasy goodness aside, the three major chains do deserve credit for 
responding to changing public concerns. Saturated fats, like beef tallow, 
contribute significantly to heart disease and other ailments. But fats of this 
kind also add a flavor and texture that explains much of the appeal of certain 
prepared foods. That's why the challenge was to find substitutes that would 
approximate the taste consumers like. 
</P>
<P>
The great fried potato reform is part of a revolution in the fast-food world. A 
lot of chain restaurants are now offering grilled chicken instead of fried, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
Fast-food restaurants serve billions of meals each year. Efforts to make those 
meals healthier -- without losing all the fun -- deserve approval.

'THE MARKET' IS BLAMELESS THIS TIME; 
</P>
<P>
THE S&amp;L MESS WAS ENGINEERED, AND LARGELY BY DEMOCRATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY JR., William F. Buckley Jr. is a syndicated columnist 
based in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the Arbatov Institute in Moscow last week, the Soviet expert twitted his 
guests about American savings-and-loans: "We have had difficulties in our 
public sector, you have had difficulties in your private sector." What? Private 
sector? 
</P>
<P>
The people at Arbatov, otherwise known as the U.S.-Canada Institute, are as 
bright as people can be who have served a Marxist government for so many years, 
from which one concludes that the myth is widespread that the collapse of the 
thrifts is a free-market disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it is not. The $300 billion we hear about every day or two would not 
exist as a liability but for government. There is nothing more clearly a part 
of the public sector than a government guarantee, and it is government 
guarantees that cause the S&amp;Ls to be a noticeable economic phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
The way the Communists and the Democrats would like to put it, the story goes 
roughly as follows: Deregulation was a goal of the private sector, motivated by 
greed. Under the Reagan Administration, the thrifts were deregulated, pursuant 
to Republican cupidity. Result: The taxpayers are out $300 billion. 
</P>
<P>
That's roughly how Democratic polemicists want to parlay the thrift story, 
perhaps nudging Neil Bush up as president ex officio of S&amp;L Inc. Anybody 
who believes that ought to work for the Arbatov Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Deregulation is a good idea, and much of it was done under the Carter 
Administration. It was then, for instance, that airplane deregulation was done. 
</P>
<P>
What became visible during the 1970s was that there was a credit crunch 
stifling the thrifts. This was the result of the deregulation of commercial 
banks, which began then to make loans at commercial rates of interest. The 
S&amp;Ls pointed out that unless they could compete with the banks, they too 
would become extinct. You cannot entice depositors by offering them 4.5% in 
interest when the bank next door is offering 7.5. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic moment in the history of the S&amp;Ls came when, in the last 
year of the Carter Administration, the ceiling on deposit insurance was 
unobtrusively raised from $40,000 to $100,000. Four legislators, according to 
an eyewitness, met calmly in a back room during a temporary adjournment and 
decided to up the insurance. Three Democrats (Sens. William Proxmire and Alan 
Cranston and Rep. Fernand St. Germain) and one Republican (Sen. Jake Garn) 
simply decided that 100 grand was more like it, and the next thing we knew, 
that became the law. 
</P>
<P>
That was a significant raise, which immediately caught the attention of Wall 
Street money brokers who were happy to place $100,000 chunks of loose change 
with whatever thrift in town was offering the highest interest. What was there 
to lose, with Uncle Sam agreeing to guarantee the safety of the deposit? Of 
course, the S&amp;L offering the highest interest was the S&amp;L in the 
greatest trouble, the thrift that desperately needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
In due course the thrifts turned to Congress with a complaint: We are free to 
pay whatever interest we choose to pay to our depositors under deregulation, 
but we are not free, under existing legislation, to deregulate our "assets." In 
non-banking lingo, they were saying: Certain things we can't lend money on, and 
therefore can't make a profit on, so please give us the liberty to move away 
from staid old home mortgages, and let us swing like the bankers across the 
street. Whereupon the thrifts went chasing after office buildings, fast-food 
restaurants and amusement parks. St. Germain, the ever-accommodating House 
Banking Committee chairman, went further, with a bill authorizing the S&amp;Ls 
to lend up to 100% of an asset's appraised value, never mind that the actual 
purchase price was lower. In the words of economist Edwin Rubenstein: "S&amp;Ls 
could now lend $2 million on a $1-million project, so long as an accommodating 
appraiser could be found. Speculators and swindlers moved in. Their motto: 
'Heads I win, tails FSLIC (Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation) 
loses.' " 
</P>
<P>
By the time Ronald Reagan took office, 3,300 of the 3,800 thrifts were losing 
money. In 1986, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III tried to get through the 
Democratic Congress a $15-billion bailout plan -- 5% of estimated current 
federal liabilities. It was torpedoed by House boss Jim Wright and our old 
friend Fernand St. Germain. 
</P>
<P>
A classic case of the feds making possible an economic catastrophe.

Free-enterprisers here at home gloat over the failures of socialism in Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union, and President Bush has just offered the services 
of American experts to help the Soviet Union create a free-market economy. 
Included in the offer is technical advice on how to set up a private banking 
system. As if ours were not in a state of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The savings-and-loan crisis will cost the American taxpayer at least $200 
billion in the next 10 years. This corporate welfare program was brought to us 
by the conservative philosophy that many Americans want to export: An 
individual should have the freedom to maximize profits unfettered by state 
regulation. The free-marketeers' argument, in the early '80s, was: Gut the 
regulatory system, because that will energize the free market and fatten the 
Treasury without cost to the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't work that way, and now the hunt is on for the culprits -- government 
officials, members of Congress, bank directors and investors -- including the 
President's son. Hardly anyone is asking the key question: When are market 
principles bad for the economy and bad for democracy? 
</P>
<P>
A memo from Charles Keating's American Continental, the parent corporation of 
Lincoln S&amp;L, advised its bond salesmen: "Remember, the weak, meek and 
ignorant are always good targets." Two-hundred million dollars of now-worthless 
bonds were sold investors, most of them elderly, many of whom put their life 
savings into Keating's hands assuming the bonds were insured. 
</P>
<P>
This violates common notions of decency and justice -- but what market 
principles did Keating violate? Suppose the memo had been rephrased: "Let's 
target our advertising to those over 65 in the lower-middle income tax brackets 
with a high school education or less." That might just sound like good 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Granted: Keating used S&amp;L funds for high-risk ventures in hotels, real 
estate, junk bonds, stocks and a casino -- investments that lost millions. 
Maybe that sounds like bad business, but bad business is part of the "free" 
market, too. 
</P>
<P>
Or take the case of Neil Bush. As a director of Silverado Bank, he voted to 
approve loans to two close business associates. What is so bad about that? 
Maybe they weren't good risks, but that's his call as a director. Maybe the 
bank made a bad choice in making him director, but the officers knew about his 
business partners, and they took his advice anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Why not just chalk up the S&amp;L debacle to the market freedom that 
individuals have to risk their money and make a profit -- or take a loss? 
</P>
<P>
Simple. Banking is not purely a business. Allowing free reign of the market 
could destroy the banking system and more. The regulations that insure deposits 
were instituted after the Crash of 1929 because the banking system -- and thus 
the whole economy -- could not work if people did not have the confidence to 
put their savings in banks. Other regulations require that bank directors 
disqualify themselves from votes about loans to their associates and prohibit 
loans exceeding 5% of the bank's assets. The Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation has watchdog examiners that are supposed to to prevent unsound 
business practices that might require a bailout. 
</P>
<P>
Such regulations make sense. We can't allow market principles to rule in 
situations that are destructive. 
</P>
<P>
But just what does destructive mean -- damaging to the banking system, 
prejudicial to the stock market, injurious to the environment, harmful to the 
poor? 
</P>
<P>
In a democracy, it's the citizens and not the market that should make these 
political decisions and enforce them. 
</P>
<P>
This is exactly where our political system has failed. For one thing, the 
free-market rhetoric of the Reagan years made both Democrats and Republicans 
reluctant to back "regulation." Existing regulations were hamstrung by members 
of Congress in both parties that took contributions from S&amp;Ls and defended 
their interests. 
</P>
<P>
The problem goes deeper. Taking money from PACs, special interests and the 
wealthy corrodes the democratic principle of one person, one vote. Yet such 
practices have become the norm in American politics; some say that they're 
essential in the era of expensive TV-oriented campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
We may have much to teach the former communist nations about capitalist 
democracy, but we've got some big changes to make if we want to give them 
something to emulate. A good start would be to reform campaign financing to 
keep the market out of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the best advice we can offer other countries is this: Encourage public 
debate and democratic decisions about where to permit the free market and where 
to limit it. And then give them a hand, whether we like what they choose or 
not.

WE NEED A WORD FOR SUCCESS WITHOUT VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALFIE KOHN, Alfie Kohn is the author of No Contest: The Case Against 
Competition (Houghton Mifflin, 1986) and The Brighter Side of Human Nature.

<P>
The American infatuation with being No. 1 -- conspicuous at work, at school, at 
play and at home -- has lately begun to manifest itself in talk about how our 
businesses need to become more "competitive." Virtually every economist, 
educator and politician chants this annoying buzzword as if it were a mantra, 
but few seriously consider its implications. 
</P>
<P>
Its use suggests a confusion between excellence and higher productivity, on the 
one hand, and the desperate quest to beat people, on the other -- two concepts 
that are not only distinct in theory but often antithetical in practice. From 
such sloppy speech comes sloppy thinking: If we have no language to talk about 
success without victory, then the very idea ceases to be real for us. 
</P>
<P>
In practical terms, our veneration of competition also leaves us with no way of 
establishing relationships with others, including other countries, outside of a 
zero-sum game. As politicians continue to genuflect before the god of 
Competitiveness -- which these days refers chiefly to trying to beat the 
Japanese -- the conditions are established for the needless creation of a new 
enemy to replace the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the real lesson of the Cold War is not that "we" beat "them" but that 
both sides have been crippled as a result of an adversarial perspective. The 
solution is not to compete with the Soviets or the Japanese in non-military 
matters, but to move beyond competition itself. The concrete question we should 
be asking now is how, in trade and in other affairs, we can be working with 
other nations to produce mutually beneficial results. In the long run, we are 
all losers because of our obsession with being competitive rather than 
cooperative.

<P>
IRAQ IS NOT THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS; 
</P>
<P>
WHILE THE WEST PERSISTS IN WISHFUL THINKING, SADDAM HUSSEIN IS POSITIONING 
HIMSELF TO BE THE NO. 1 ARAB POWER.

<TEXT>
<P>
The West is once more in danger of misreading the nature of Iraq's president, 
Saddam Hussein, and his ambitions for his country. Unless there is a 
clear-sighted view of his intentions and an effective response to them, Western 
interests in the Persian Gulf will be in deep jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
The record of Western misapprehension about Hussein's regime is extensive, 
going back to 1980, when Iraq invaded Iran. Ignoring a raft of evidence, 
Western analysts and policy-makers attributed Iraqi aggression to fear of Iran 
and its revolution, rather than to Iraq's ambitions to become the dominant 
power in the Persian Gulf and the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
These analysts made their next serious mistake by interpreting Hussein's 
downshifts in rhetoric, necessitated by war needs, as indicating deep and 
long-lasting ideological and institutional transformation of Iraqi politics and 
society. This misreading led to Western expectations about Iraqi behavior that 
could only be characterized as wishful thinking. For example, it was generally 
expected that Iraq would liberalize its political system and play a positive 
role in resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Perhaps it would even join Egypt 
and Jordan in an Arab coalition willing to make peace with Israel. The pay-off: 
total Western support for Iraq in the Persian Gulf war. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this sort of analysis, the West -- the United States and Europe -- 
helped Iraq economically and militarily far beyond what was necessary to 
contain Iran. Simultaneously, by weakening Iran more than was necessary to keep 
it from dominating the Persian Gulf, the West helped to create a disequilibrium 
in the regional balance, which Saddam Hussein has exploited ever since. 
</P>
<P>
After the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, and despite the obvious shift in the 
regional military balance, the West persisted in viewing Iran as the greater 
threat and refused to force Iraq to live up to its commitments under U.N. 
Security Council Resolution 598, the basis for the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
The West also continued to turn a blind eye to Iraq's massive human-rights 
violations and was years late in condemning Iraq's use of chemical weapons, the 
most extensive since the World War I. The Western attitude toward Iraq's drive 
for nuclear capability has also been muted. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Iraq's threat to Kuwait's security and territorial integrity was 
seen by many Western analysts as mere posturing in order to boost oil prices at 
the OPEC meeting in Geneva. As usual, they cautioned against antagonizing 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
This analysis is seriously in error. There can be no doubt that Iraq wants to 
become the dominant power in the Persian Gulf, which its own 30 miles of 
coastline does not merit. Thus, it must control the Iranian shoreline or that 
of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein is a typical Arab nationalist, in the Nasser mold, who views the 
gulf rulers as reactionary Western surrogates and impediments to achievement of 
Arab nationalists' goals. Now that he is riding high in popularity among the 
Arab masses, and because of Arab frustration over the Palestinian problem, he 
is testing to see whether he can supplant these gulf leaders or at least bring 
them under his control. Nor would Iraq need to launch a full-scale military 
invasion of Kuwait to achieve its goal. It could force Kuwait to surrender or 
lease strategic islands or even to unite with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
If successful, critical Iraqi influence over the West's oil lifeline would lead 
Hussein to pressure the West on the Palestinian problem. 
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, what is the West to do? It has already narrowed its 
options by having indulged Hussein for too long. For example, given Iraq's 
current military strength, it would not be easy to mount a U.S. naval operation 
similar to the re-flagging and protecting of Kuwaiti tankers that was carried 
out at the height of the war in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the West must act before it is too late. First, it must finally 
see Hussein for what he really is and stop entertaining false hopes. It must be 
more prudent about Iraq's nuclear program, and it must apply economic pressure 
while Iraq is still financially vulnerable. Let's hope the U.S. Senate's voting 
of economic sanctions Friday marks the start of a long-term policy 
re-evaluation. The West, including Europe, must stop new credits and loans to 
Baghdad, and if that is not sufficient, an economic boycott, including Iraq's 
oil, may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The West also must try to restore some balance in the region by helping Iran's 
moderates, easing Iran's re-integration in the world community and encouraging 
Arab-Iranian reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the West must do all it can to break the deadlock on the Arab-Israeli 
peace process and find a solution to the Palestinian problem -- the single most 
important rallying cry for frustrated Arabs and the best tool of manipulation 
for their ambitious leaders.

KONSPIRA SOLIDARITY UNDERGROUND BY MACIEJ LOPINSKI, MARCIN MOSKIT AND MARIUSZ

<TEXT>
<P>
Forming an underground seems to be a typically Polish way of coping with a 
political disaster. Since the 19th Century, the best men and women of nearly 
each generation have felt compelled to leave their homes and families in order 
to plot the overthrow of foreign powers, or to struggle for the country's 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
It was no accident, then, that on the night of Dec. 12, 1981, when Gen. 
Wojciech Jaruzelski's police started to arrest opposition leaders, those who 
managed to escape the net went underground and, after a number of aborted 
attempts, formed "Solidarity underground structures," better known as Konspira 
-- from the Polish word the conspiracy. Soon Konspira was rumored to reach into 
the remotest corners of the country, to have a million regular participants, to 
run thousands of illegal Solidarity cells and clandestine publishing 
enterprises, even to infiltrate the police and the military. 
</P>
<P>
Was it reality or legend? More significantly, was it the best way to deal with 
the Polish predicament -- the discrepancy between aspirations of the society 
and the dismal political realities of Brezhnev's final years? Most of the 
opposition activists who were arrested endured their detainment with dignity, 
and after their release undertook all sorts of independent yet open activities 
to preserve the Solidarity spirit and push the government toward some kind of 
negotiated solution. 
</P>
<P>
They wrote books and published them abroad or underground, organized 
clandestine lectures and seminars, launched a campaign of support for the 
victims of repression and the declining economy. There were other, spontaneous 
expressions of social defiance: wearing forbidden badges and symbols, laying 
flowers at the sites of national martyrdom, boycotting various official 
institutions, attending church celebrations and street protests. Was Konspira 
really the driving spirit and the organizer of all those actions? 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, three young journalists -- Maciej Lopinski, Marcin Moskit (real name 
Zbigniew Gach) and Mariusz Wilk -- decided to seek out seven of the best-known, 
and best-hidden, leaders of the underground and ask them directly. The result 
of their investigation was a book of interviews now made available to the 
American reader. "Konspira," published in 1984 by one of the Poland's 
underground houses, received an annual Solidarity award for best independent 
publication, yet provoked some heated debates among the opposition leaders. 
Even an official pro-Jaruzelski weekly, Polityka, chose to reprint fragments of 
the book without the authors' permission, and with some obnoxious commentary. 
</P>
<P>
The story of the underground, told in the leaders' own words, was definitely 
less heroic and innocent than many expected. It was a story of great sacrifice 
and courage, but also of petty ambitions, personal squabbles and the sense of 
growing isolation from the mainstream of the political life. The main redeeming 
quality in those partly cocky, partly confessional statements is their great 
honesty, the sense of moral responsibility and almost obsessive preoccupation 
with purity of means and intentions. 
</P>
<P>
What we see here is a sophisticated resistance aware of the many pitfalls of 
"underground mentality." This awareness is eloquently expressed by one of the 
most steadfast and unimpeachable Solidarity leaders, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk: 
"Although everyone wants to fight for an independent Poland, a self-governing 
society, brotherhood and so forth, increasingly we are using dubious and 
underhanded methods. Brotherhood becomes a fiction, there's no unity, and 
ideals get pushed aside." 
</P>
<P>
Like all underground organizations in history, Konspira had to devote most of 
its energy and resources to itself: establishing contacts and setting up safe 
houses, training and protecting its people, looking for money and technical 
support. Relations with the external world -- the clandestine Solidarity cells 
in factories and the society at large -- proved more difficult to manage. 
Channels of communication were slow, awareness of the popular moods often 
inadequate, and the underground governing body, the Interregional Coordinating 
Committee, was hard pressed to find a unified strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of leading and coordinating, Konspira often limited itself to 
supporting and evaluating spontaneous initiatives. It was in that area, too, 
that the underground suffered occasional setbacks. Some of the strikes and 
demonstrations it called for never came off, while others broke out without the 
underground's knowledge or approval. Sometimes a letter of support arrived to a 
striking factory exactly at the moment when protests were losing momentum, or 
the situation was turning dangerous and unmanageable. 
</P>
<P>
The underground's main problem was to justify its existence as something more 
than just a symbol of defiance. Yet what was really the long-term purpose of 
all its efforts and sacrifices? Contending opinions were voiced in underground 
publications but the conclusions often were ambiguous and unconvincing. 
</P>
<P>
The trade-unionist branch pushed for a general strike as a all-out battle with 
the government. Some proposed formation of an underground state, with regular 
political bodies, its own judicial system and foreign representation, modeled 
on the structures that existed under the German occupation. Still others opted 
for a broad and loosely organized "civil society" that would maintain social 
integrity and prepare the Poles for democracy. The controversy was never fully 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the Solidarity underground was denied a spectacular victory, or 
even a heroic defeat. In 1988, Jaruzelski's government, encouraged by 
Gorbachev's policy of "openness" and convinced that its own methods never would 
assure political and economic stability, started to drift cautiously toward a 
negotiated solution, resulting in the "round-table agreements" of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the agreements' success certainly was due to the endurance of the 
"underground men" who kept reminding the government, the Polish society and the 
world that any political solution must take into account the heritage of 
Solidarity. Yet the agreement was outlined by those opposition activists -- 
mostly intellectuals -- who had been acting openly and seeking some 
rapprochement with the reform-minded fractions of the government. The result 
was a certain sense of bitterness and disappointment among those who devoted 
eight years of their lives to the underground. 
</P>
<P>
"Konspira" contains a fair amount of interesting human material about the 
personal motivations, fears and doubts of these men. It is, undoubtedly, a 
valuable historical document, and was reprinted recently in Poland by one of 
the new private publishing houses. Yet history seems to be moving too fast to 
favor careful reevaluations of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity, cast simultaneously in the role of the government and the 
opposition, clearly is struggling with a crisis of identity. The first 
non-Communist government, headed by old Solidarity adviser Tadeusz Mazowiecki, 
recently became a target of vitriolic criticism from Walesa and the new 
centrist bloc, which proposed Walesa as the next president. 
</P>
<P>
Even with hyperinflation halted, Polish productive powers remain in deep 
recession, and the economic miracle many secretly hoped for is slow in coming. 
Familiar and disturbing sentiments of chauvinism and intolerance begin to be 
heard from some marginal groups. Against all that, the period of anti-Communist 
struggle may yet be viewed as an era of moral simplicity and purity. 
</P>
<P>
"Konspira's" chief value may be in treating that romantic myth with realism, 
without depriving it of its basic nobility.

<P>
BEDROCK BY LISA ALTHER (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 325 PP.; 0-394-57755-8) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Merle Rubin, Rubin is a free-lance writer.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hunger to see ourselves mirrored in fiction leads readers and reviewers 
alike to overestimate the literary value of novels that seem to catch the feel 
of the times. Lisa Alther's engaging first novel, "Kinflicks" (1976), a ribald 
account of coming-of-age in the '60s, elicited accolades likening it to a 
female version of such classics as "Tom Jones," "Huckleberry Finn," "A Portrait 
of the Artist As a Young Man" and "The Catcher in the Rye." 
</P>
<P>
Alther went on to make a creditably strong showing with her second book, 
"Original Sins" (1981), and continued to garner respectful reviews with "Other 
Women" (1984). I remember it well, because one of the respectful reviews was 
mine. 
</P>
<P>
Alther's fiction reflects a lot of what is new and different about the times 
we've been living through -- or, at very least, a lot of what we perceive as 
new and different, whether or not it is so. As times change, and as her 
heroines get older, Alther continues to report back to us in novels that could 
well be classified as a fictionalized -- and superior -- form of sociology. 
</P>
<P>
Her latest novel, "Bedrock," gives us Clea Shawn, a sophisticated woman making 
her way through the murky waters of middle age. A strikingly attractive woman 
subject to impulsive, whirlwind love affairs, Clea is married to a man who also 
has flings when on business trips. Clea, long accustomed to a cosmopolitan 
life, suddenly decides to buy a house in a small Vermont town, much to the 
horror of her husband, children and close friend Elke, a German-born artist who 
at one point almost became Clea's lover. 
</P>
<P>
In the picturesque, pristine-looking town of Roches Ridge, Clea sees a setting 
for all the "bedrock" values. As she slowly discovers, however, Roches Ridge is 
merely a microcosm of the world she hoped to leave behind, featuring home-grown 
criminals, local farm boys who organize "gayrides," a handsome hairdresser who 
models himself on Warren Beatty in "Shampoo," a Lesbian New Age commune, a 
fundamentalist preacher who shrouds his womenfolk in veils while lusting after 
the beehive hairdo of the free-wheeling woman who owns the local greasy spoon, 
and, last but not least, Clea's immediate neighbors, a degenerate family 
descended from the town founders, who live by trapping animals for food and 
salvaging designer clothing from the bodies of accident victims. 
</P>
<P>
Although Clea's impressions of the townfolks' perception of her is often a 
source of humor and irony, and sometimes a way of providing insight and 
dimension, most of the time it is heavy-handed and needlessly repetitive. 
Essentially, what Alther is doing is juxtaposing contrasting sets of 
stereotypes, over and over. Neither the story nor the characters are 
interesting enough in the first place to bear retelling each incident and 
redescribing each character multiple times from various viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
"Bedrock" has its moments, though. A kind of thinking-woman's Erica Jong, 
Alther has a knack for conveying the tempo of contemporary manners and mores, 
as in this brief passage: "In the midst of verbal maneuvers designed to elicit 
sexual histories so each could make an informed decision concerning the risk of 
fatal infection, Clea found herself yawning. For Jim at age thirty-two, an 
affair with an older woman was probably exciting, but for Clea, even excitement 
had become boring." 
</P>
<P>
But like Clea, Alther seems to be losing her touch. Contemplating the carnage 
of Elke's European childhood, Clea asks her European man of the moment why "men 
seem to have this need to live in tents and kill each other?" His wise old 
European reply to her innocent American question -- "Perhaps if you were 
circumcised as a baby without an anesthetic, you would want to kill too" -- 
makes very little sense, humorous or otherwise, in view of the fact that during 
the period in question, most of the circumcised male population of Europe was 
being herded into death camps by the uncircumcised majority.

SCIENCE FICTION;

<P>
WOLF AND IRON BY GORDON R. DICKSON (TOM DOHERTY ASSOCIATES/TOR: $18.95; 468 
PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CLUTE, John Clute's most recent book, Strokes: Essays and Reviews 
1966-1986 (Serconia), assembles his comments on many science-fiction writers, 
including Gordon R. Dickson and Gene Wolfe. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most science-fiction novels seem to begin with the end of the world. It is, 
perhaps, no wonder. The dilemmas we must face, as citizens of the planet in 
1990, are simply too complex to write good stories about. The easiest way to 
cope (in fiction) is to wipe the slate clean. 
</P>
<P>
For the writer who wishes to entertain us with the future, almost anything will 
do -- a plague of mutant AIDS viruses, or war, or famine, or the sudden death 
of the oceans, or perhaps a simple collapse. Then, once the decks have been 
cleared, the story can begin. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon R. Dickson -- a veteran writer from the 1950s, when the future was more 
easily grasped -- takes the simplest option in "Wolf and Iron." To begin his 
novel, he chooses collapse. 
</P>
<P>
In America, the late 20th Century has, quite suddenly, ceased to be 
sustainable. The cities have collapsed. Government has imploded. Gangs loot the 
countryside. Jeebee Walter escapes the shambles of his university town to trek 
westward through dangerous country in the direction of his older brother's 
ranch in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
En route, he liberates a wolf from captivity; slowly and delicately, the two 
establish a working rapport. He comes across a traveling caravan, and learns 
from its sagacious master some further lessons in coping with the new world; 
and he falls in love with the old man's resilient daughter. They part. He 
reaches Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries force him to set up camp short of his brother's territory. After the 
ambush of her caravan, the girl (in the only pulpy moment of the book) manages 
to reach him. They have a child. The wolf continues, more and more intimately, 
to behave like a wolf. Jeebee and the girl decide to stay where they are. The 
book ends. 
</P>
<P>
It all sounds very much too simple, a Robinsonade that makes Crusoe's 
experiences seem positively worldly, but "Wolf and Iron," a tale sustained on a 
raft of emotion, shines in its clarity like a jewel. Perhaps it is because 
Dickson wears his heart so openly on his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious he loves the cleansed and emptied America of Jeebee's trek; he 
loves Jeebee himself, his sinewy alertness of mind, his singular attentiveness 
to the new world and how to make things work in it; and he loves the entirely 
realistic wolf whose behavior he has so meticulously envisioned. "Wolf and 
Iron" is what one might call a fascinated book. 
</P>
<P>
After the labored pulpit-pounding of Dickson's Childe Cycle, it returns us to 
the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE QUIET POOLS by Michael P. Kube-McDowell (Ace Books: $17.95; 371 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
"The Quiet Pools," Michael P. Kube-McDowell's first novel, is of genuinely 
strong interest, but its underlying premise is devastating to the self-esteem 
of the human race. 
</P>
<P>
It is the 21st Century. Against fervent opposition, a private corporation is 
building spaceships to carry select populations to the stars. Christopher 
McCutcheon, who works for The Diaspora Project but who does not himself wish to 
embark, slowly analyzes his bruised self, his failed marriage group, his 
enigmatic father, and through a slightly over-complicated plot discovers 
something of the truth behind things. Some humans (he learns) have a genetic 
quirk that compels them into space, and those who remain behind are bound to 
the planet by what they lack. 
</P>
<P>
There is a glad tale-telling energy about the book -- just as there was about 
James Tiptree Jr.'s best stories -- that carries one on, as though to joy; but 
just as in Tiptree's "A Momentary Taste of Being," the message of "The Quiet 
Pools" is ultimately determinist and bleak. We are walking spermatozoa, 
Kube-McDowell suggests; and, as we depart this world, it is likely we will 
leave our nest in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE DIVIDE by Robert Charles Wilson (Foundation/Doubleday: $19.95, cloth; 
$8.95, paper) 
</P>
<P>
Take a break with "The Divide," a neat and simple dual-personality drama by 
Robert Charles Wilson that looks as though it is going to address some heavy 
issues, but ends in a fit of glamorizing plot. 
</P>
<P>
A man whose intelligence has been artificially enhanced creates a secondary 
personality to cope with mundane matters. When he finds his own abilities 
beginning to decay, he must attempt to come to terms with the sharer he has 
created. 
</P>
<P>
It is a familiar SF tale, which is no reason not to retell it, and Wilson is 
deft and nifty and quick off the mark. But his problem is just that: He stays 
nifty. In the process, he sloughs off any anguish inherent in the drama he has 
begun to develop, and for a climax tricks his tale up in tiresome twists like a 
fatally unambitious magician looking for a fast curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Those final moments are too contorted and too dumb to expose in their entirety 
-- but guess who gets his brains sorted out by a blow to the head? Right. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WALKER OF WORLDS by Tom De Haven (Foundation/Doubleday: $19.95, cloth; $8.95, 
paper) 
</P>
<P>
In "Walker of Worlds," the first book of a projected sequence, "Chronicles of 
the King's Tramp," Tom De Haven almost fox-trots us into his grip for good by 
the time we're halfway through. By the end of the book, after we have managed 
to walk with the large cast into a world deeper than ours, it is as though we 
had gone through the pain barrier in a dance marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Most magic-realist science-fantasy novels -- like John Crowley's "Little, Big" 
and Mark Helprin's "A Winter's Tale," both of which are invoked in the blurb -- 
show a reverent quiet at the point where our world meets its maker, and 
characters may pass into their true selves. It is exactly at this point in 
"Walker of Worlds" that all hell breaks loose. 
</P>
<P>
Jack the Walker, and the eccentric human cast he has garnered, travel inwards 
to the world of King Sad Agel, and stumble into an immense affray with 
thousands of bats and mages and Epicenes and cronies. It is like a fantasy 
role-playing game: Every turn of the page is a turn of the plot. 
</P>
<P>
Before the chaos subsides briefly -- as a breather before Volume Two -- we lose 
that sense of bated breath so central to Crowley and Helprin, the sense that 
our own world, which bears the stamp of the real world within, may allow us to 
partake of some great secret. So far -- though brilliantly at points -- De 
Haven offers nothing but gossip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CASTLEVIEW by Gene Wolfe (Tom Doherty Associates/Tor: $18.95; 279 pp) 
</P>
<P>
"Castleview," the latest novel from the great Gene Wolfe, introduces at least 
50 named characters, and some of them are shape-changers. As in almost any 
Wolfe novel, some single key will unlock the flickering mosaic of story, though 
it will not tell the meaning of what is to be found inside. 
</P>
<P>
In this book, the key seems to be that there are too many characters to fit 
into the roles available for them. The main story takes 24 hours. Will E. 
Shields and family arrive in Castleview to live and work, but the town, long 
haunted by visions of a moving castle, now suffers a series of supernatural 
visitors from the world of King Arthur. They are looking for new avatars. It is 
like a recruiting drive, or a game of musical chairs. 
</P>
<P>
That great stage-manager of impostors -- Puss in Boots -- makes an appearance. 
Farce ascends to a grave music. An Arthur is selected. A sacrifice is made. 
Like all of Wolfe's work, "Castleview" is a game and an act of reverence -- a 
fine dream of superb gallantry.

Photo, For two decades after the Berlin Wall's erection in 1961, the 
15-foot-high barrier stood gray and forbidding, marked only by guard towers. 
But in the early 1980s, a group of artists including Keith Haring and Harald 
Nageli (the "Zurich Sprayer") began to attack the featureless concrete. Soon 
the 102-mile-long wall was an enormous public canvas, covered with any and all 
means of expression: spray paint, mosaics, even lipstick. German artist Hermann 
Waldenberg's photos of this figurative storming of the barrier, taken between 
1984 and the Wall's physical dismantling last year, are collected in "The 
Berlin Wall" (Abbeville Press: $19.95, paper).

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE STONES OF ATLANTIS BY DAVID ZINK (PRENTICE HALL: 
$10.95, ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this unintentionally hilarious compendium of pseudo-science, David Zink 
argues that the Caribbean island of Bimini is a remnant of the "lost continent" 
of Atlantis and/or one of its colonies and/or the source of the story of the 
Fountain of Youth and/or the site of an ancient civilization founded by 
visitors from the Pleiades, ca. 28,000 B.C. Buttressing his contentions with 
dubious evidence that ranges from psychic visions to the writings of Edgar 
Cayce and Immanuel Velikovsky, Zink makes leaps of faith that should qualify 
him for the interdenominational Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
More reputable scholars, including the late Joseph Campbell, trace the origins 
of the Atlantis legend to the destruction of the Mediterranean island of Thera 
in 1485 B.C.; Plato embroidered the story to illustrate the sin of hubris, or 
overweening vanity -- which probably includes presenting one's half-baked pet 
notions as scientific fact.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE BLACKSMITH: IRONWORKER AND FARRIER BY ALDREN A. WATSON 
(W.W. NORTON: $14.95, ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first half of Aldren Watson's study has the pleasant, gently didactic tone 
of a good educational film. 
</P>
<P>
Using words and neat ink drawings, he explains the duties and roles of a New 
England blacksmith: his tools and supplies, his pay, his importance to the 
community. Much of that importance derived from his work shoeing horses: In 
freeway-conscious Southern California, it's easy to forget that horses were 
important means of transportation well into the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The second half of the book is devoted to a set of plans for building a 
blacksmith's forge, should the reader wish to undertake this unlikely project.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE LIGHT IN THE FOREST BY CONRAD RICHTER (BANTAM: $3.50) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Light in the Forest" has been considered a classic boy's book since it 
originally was published in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad Richter's tale of divided loyalties centers on John Butler, a boy raised 
by the Lenni Lenapi Indians, then returned to his white family. Perhaps because 
Richter intended the book for juveniles readers, the characters are 
relentlessly one-note. The honest, dignified, nature-loving Indians are not 
merely Noble, but Noblest Savages; the white settlers are petty, cruel and 
deceitful. The bleak, somewhat abrupt ending is considerably stronger than the 
happy conclusion tacked onto the popular Disney film.

STAGEWEEK: A MUM'S OCEANIC FANTASY AT OCEAN BEACH PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nathan Stein's "Late Breaking Muse," is an "oceanic divertimento," an outdoor 
fantasy piece for kids of all ages opening Saturday at Ocean Beach Park in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"We built the (set) in my backyard in Echo Park, being chased inside every 
Thursday night by the malathion spraying," said Stein, who's also one-third of 
a local juggling group, the Mums. Although the trio has been touted as 
modern-day vaudevillians, Stein hungers for more political substance. "We 
cannot just indulge in our own ascetic art bubble. So it's always more 
compelling to put the work into that (societal) context. But this is not 
agitprop." 
</P>
<P>
Stein's tale begins with the discovery of trouble in paradise -- "the paradise 
in peril here being Atlantis. Oil spills have begun to beat across the 
aqua-ceiling. So Poseidon has dispatched his youngest daughter to handle the 
situation; she arrives in a chariot, newly endowed with arms and legs." 
</P>
<P>
It's a state of mind that Stein could well understand. Last year, he was the 
victim of "a fight with a table saw" that mauled his left arm and forced him to 
learn juggling all over again. "So I had an enforced sabbatical," he said. "I 
learned how caring the theatrical community was. It's also when the visual poem 
("Muse") began emerging -- and with it, grants-writing fever. Now I've got what 
makes all artists tick: funding and a deadline." 
</P>
<P>
The piece, presented free of charge, was written for four performers ("partly 
because of financial considerations, partly because it's the next step after 
triohood") and does not feature his fellow Mums. "There were scheduling 
conflicts," he says diplomatically. "Although I think the late hours and low 
pay also factored in." 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BUZZ: Don't accuse Brandon Maggart of falling into Hollywood's 
type-casting trap. The actor, who played the homophobic Lou for five years on 
Showtime's "Brothers" -- as well as Lynn Redgrave's anti-Semitic sibling in 
ABC's "Chicken Soup" -- will don a milkman's cap as Tevye in "Fiddler on the 
West Hollywood Roof" (opening Friday at the Harmony Gold Playhouse), a benefit 
staging for the AIDS Hospice Foundation. Says a press rep, "He's a very Jewish 
Tevye in a very gay spoof of 'Fiddler.' " 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: Christopher Durang's "Laughing Wild," a comedy on the 
absurdities of modern life, is playing at the Tiffany Theatre. Dennis Erdman 
("The Marriage of Bette and Boo") directs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sylvie Drake in The Times: " 'Wild's' barbs are savagely, consistently on 
target, though at some serious risk of self-defeat. (Its) references to figures 
of such fleeting celebrity as Dr. Ruth Westheimer and Phil Donahue . . . may 
not mean much 20 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News' Lawrence Enscoe found "a tight, tough little piece of monologue 
work, nicely paced, achingly detailed and full of the kind of quotable lines 
you want to use at dinner parties. That's the first act. The second finds 
itself too mired in familiar Durang turf." 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Kathleen O'Steen in Daily Variety: "From all of the irreverent images 
comes a work that finds a good deal of laughter, but also echoes a strange 
melancholy. The play itself is more commentary and characterization than 
drama."

ON THE RECORD: REFURBISHING THE IMAGE OF PERCY THE ODD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an age when novelty is increasingly demanded to attract new audiences to 
classical music, the name of Percy Grainger is returning to currency. Could he 
be enlisted to bridge the gap between not-quite-committed classical lovers (the 
kind, perhaps, who grew up on a mix of Judy Collins and Vivaldi) and the 
musically educated listener in need of occasional relief from the Great 
19th-Century Classics? A young pianist could do worse than to include his music 
on a recital program, and there's terrific encore fodder here. 
</P>
<P>
Grainger (1882-1961), the Australian-born, German and British-educated, 
naturalized-American pianist-composer-folklorist-teacher, is perhaps best known 
in this part of the world for having been married on the Hollywood Bowl stage, 
before an audience of 15,000, in 1928: the centerpiece of one of his own 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
His abilities as a pianist were attested to by Grieg, of whose concerto he was 
the foremost exponent for decades. His works were posthumously revived by 
Benjamin Britten, and there wasn't a between-wars audience, irrespective of 
taste or education, not familiar with the art and handsome visage of this 
delightful, gifted eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death in New York in 1961, however, he was both broke and 
broken, his considerable wealth having gone to help the U.S. war effort and to 
support his ethnomusical museum in Australia. His final years were spent in a 
fruitless attempt to devise a new music, independent, we are told, of such 
archaisms as pitch, rhythm and harmony. A quixotic end for one who dedicated 
his life to making music accessible. 
</P>
<P>
To tell us more than we've ever previously known about the man's art, the 
Nimbus label has embarked on a multi-issue Grainger project to include all his 
works for solo piano, to be called -- in the composer's own parlance -- "Dished 
Up for Piano." The performer is Britisher Martin Jones, an artist of 
consequence who has in recent years given us superior recordings of Debussy and 
Mendelssohn. 
</P>
<P>
Volume I (NI 5220) contains original, once widely circulated works that in the 
proper hands -- certainly Jones' -- are sure-fire doldrum-dispellers: "Handel 
in the Strand," "Mock Morris," "The Gum-Suckers March" and "In Dahomey" as well 
as "To a Nordic Princess," which he wrote for and played at his Bowl wedding. 
</P>
<P>
The "Grainger problem" -- aside from the fact that his music is such fun (which 
to certain observers is always suspect) -- has to do with whether it's 
"classical" or not. What Englishman doesn't consider "Handel in the Strand" or 
"Country Gardens" traditional tunes? 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Grainger has suffered a curious relationship with audiences: He was 
better known during his lifetime as a performer than as a composer, yet so much 
of what he was playing, and with which he was giving infinite delight, was of 
his own creation. 
</P>
<P>
Volume II (NI 5232), devoted to Grainger the arranger, is a different 
proposition. Here, one asks, is he sending up the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto by 
cramming it into 3 1/2 minutes and dispensing with the orchestra? Actually, he 
is inflating that hyper-familiar opening theme, creating a gigantic miniature 
even tougher to play than the original. To these ears it's huge fun, and Jones 
brings it off with stunning bravura. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere among the arrangements, Grainger can be the incarnation of delicacy, 
as in his soulful reminiscence of Dowland's "Now I Needs Must Part"; a conjurer 
of an unearthly array of pianistic color in his exquisite "Ramble" on the final 
duet from "Der Rosenkavalier." Or a purveyor of salon kitsch, as in his 
super-gloss on Bach's "Sheep May Safely Graze"; and we don't need his 
tremolando-ridden, piano-bar Gershwin arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
In all, however, Grainger, with Jones as his dedicated intermediary, provides 
great pleasure, to be repeated and amplified, we trust, in subsequent releases, 
which will include more of his 'traditional' tunes, e.g., "Molly on the Shore" 
and "Country Gardens." 
</P>
<P>
That Grainger was better suited to this sort of miniaturism than to large forms 
is indicated by a release of his big orchestra works, handsomely performed by 
the Melbourne Symphony under Geoffrey Simon (Koch 7003). 
</P>
<P>
"The Warriors: Music to an Imaginary Ballet" (1917) depicts, according to 
Grainger's colorful program note, "Ghosts of male and female warriors . . . 
together for an orgy of warlike dances, a Valhalla gathering of childishly 
overbearing and arrogant savage men and women of all ages: old Greek heroes, 
shining black Zulus, flaxen-haired Vikings, squat Greenland women. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It's a long 18 minutes, in spite of some daring devices, such as -- a 
half-century before "aleatory" techniques enjoyed their brief vogue -- passages 
wherein orchestral groups "ignore the conductor's beat" and go off on 
improvisatory tangents. The result sounds less contemporary than like mildly 
skewed Delius. 
</P>
<P>
Koch's program of orchestral Grainger further includes a flossy orchestration 
(not by Grainger, so why bother?) of a Chinese folk song better known from its 
use in Puccini's "Turandot" and more effective in Grainger's own solo-piano 
version, included by Jones in Nimbus II, and a popsily sentimental Grainger 
orchestration of the folk tune from County Derry known as "Danny Boy."

Keyboard Festival will announce this week the recipients of four large career 
grants to young pianists, totaling $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
The emerging pianists, selected from 54 nominees, are: Wendy Chen, 18, of Los 
Angeles; Brenda Huang, 17, of Northbrook, Ill.; Peter Miyamoto, 20, of San 
Francisco; and Christopher Taylor, 20, of Boulder, Colo.. 
</P>
<P>
Chen, whose renewable grant is for $40,000, was, until her graduation this 
spring, a W.M. Keck Scholar at the R.D. Colburn School of Performing Arts here; 
in September she will begin studies at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Huang is still a high school student; in 1988 she won the National Chopin 
Competition in New York. Miyamoto, at present a student of Leon Fleisher and 
Claude Frank at Peabody, is a former winner of the Bronislaw Kaper Award. 
Taylor, now studying with Russell Sherman at Harvard University, has won a 
number of national piano competitions. Huang, Miyamoto and Taylor are being 
awarded $10,000 each; these grants are also renewable. 
</P>
<P>
According to David Pocock, artistic director of the $2-million, biennial 
Gilmore Festival, headquartered in Kalamazoo, Mich., the grants program is only 
one of the festival's three prongs: 
</P>
<P>
* A nine-day piano festival -- made up of concerts, recitals orchestral 
performances and master classes -- will be held every other year, beginning in 
April, 1991, in Kalamazoo. 
</P>
<P>
* A biennial program of grants to young artists (up to five) will award 
achievement and promise in amounts totaling up to $200,000, the individual 
grants to be used for career development. 
</P>
<P>
* Once every two years, the festival will designate a Gilmore Artist -- that 
artist, of any age, to be chosen through "a virtually anonymous process," 
Pocock said, and given not a one-time prize, but instead, "management services, 
a two-year international concert tour and financial assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Pocock added: "An international committee is making secret nominations to an 
artistic advisory (board) that over the months will travel, incognito, to hear 
the artists perform in scheduled recitals and concerts. So discreet is the 
process that only by winning will the pianist know that he or she has been 
nominated for the award." Announcement of the winner will be made on opening 
day of the Gilmore Festival, April 27, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"Musicianship, rather than competition skills, should, for once, have the last 
say," Pocock said. 
</P>
<P>
"Competition . . . is not humane. This is our way of changing the system." 
</P>
<P>
The Gilmore Festival is named after a longtime Kalamazoo businessman, the late 
Irving S. Gilmore, an amateur pianist who aided and supported many musicians 
during his lifetime. The festival, a separate entity, is one of many projects 
sponsored by the Gilmore Foundation of Kalamazoo. 
</P>
<P>
Pocock, who visited Los Angeles recently, told The Times that the $2-million 
cost of the entire two-year festival project ending in 1991 was covered by $1.4 
million given by the Gilmore Foundation; the rest came from fund-raising done 
by festival management. 
</P>
<P>
The 1991 festival, scheduled to be held from April 27-May 5, will offer 34 
concerts in nine days. Performers include: Claudio Arrau, Alicia de Larrocha, 
Matti Raekallio, Leon Fleisher, the Blair String Quartet, Malcolm Frager, Chick 
Corea, Malcolm Bilson, Anthony di Bonaventura, Vladimir Feltsman, Igor Kipnis 
and Marian McPartland. 
</P>
<P>
ANOTHER 'NEXT WAVE': For the seventh Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy 
of Music last year, festival makers devoted a portion of the fall-length event 
to arts in the Ruhr region of West Germany. This year, during the eighth Next 
Wave Festival from Oct. 2-Dec. 9, a four-part sub-festival will be called "Next 
Wave/Next Door" and will focus on work being done by Canadian artists in dance 
and theater. 
</P>
<P>
The dance company called O Vertigo Danse will give premieres of two works 
during the festival; in addition, a dance/theater troupe, Carbone 14, will 
present "Le Dortoir" (The Dormitory). And the theatrical company, Le Theatre 
Repere, will make its New York debut with "Polygraph," written and staged by 
Robert Lepage. 
</P>
<P>
Other dance events on the festival proper include return engagements by 
visiting dance companies: Monnaie Dance Group/Mark Morris will give two 
separate programs; Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane &amp; Co. returns with a world 
premiere, "Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin," and Susan Marshall &amp; Co. will 
bring another world premiere to Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE: Cellist Hae-Ye Ni, a first-year student at the San Francisco 
Conservatory, has won the Walter W. Naumburg Foundation International Cello 
Competition in New York City, taking $5,000 in cash and two recital appearances 
in Lincoln Center, among other prizes. Sharing the second prize were Marius 
May, 32, of London, England, and Gustav Rivinius, 25, from Saar, Germany. . . . 
Stage director August Everding and set designer Hans Schavernoch have been 
engaged (with the already announced conductor, Zubin Mehta) for the new 
production of Wagner's "Ring des Nibelungen" cycle at Lyric Opera of Chicago in 
1992-93.

This 1959 session turned out to be a match made in heaven: tenor saxophonist 
Webster with his humongous sound and straightforward sense of swing teamed with 
the baritonist who cooked but in a more obtuse way. As it happens, Mulligan was 
every inch the sure-footed swinger who complemented Webster's gutsy-toned 
moves, like Kelly and Astaire in tandem. 
</P>
<P>
Though medium-tempo tunes make up most the material, the date belongs to a 
steamy take of Billy Strayhorn's "Chelsea Bridge," which segues from Webster's 
sonic regality, captured at its most glorious (the digital remastering of this 
analog session results in spectacular sound) to an easy, loping Mulligan and 
back again -- perhaps the definitive version of this tender song. 
</P>
<P>
And there's more: the bold swagger of "Who's Got Rhythm?" and "Sunday," the 
lovely Mulligan ballad "Tell Me When" and five previously unreleased titles, 
"In a Mellotone" and a slowly stated "What Is This Thing Called Love?" among 
them. The rhythm section of Jimmy Rowles, piano, Leroy Vinegar, bass, and Mel 
Lewis, drums, fits hand-in-glove with the leaders. You can play this one 
forever. ZAN STEWART

FREE SPEECH I: Virgin Records' Jeff Ayeroff, one of the few record execs brave 
enough to take a stand against censorship and record labeling, has already made 
news by saying he'll put pro-First Amendment stickers on new Virgin discs 
starting next week. But now Virgin is battling censorship with the best weapon 
possible -- satire. Friday, the label will release "(If U Want Free Speech) Go 
to Russia," a mock-rap single by political spoofster Harry Shearer that 
features a biting attack on anti-rock crusaders. 
</P>
<P>
(The single will have cover art designed by "Simpsons" creator Matt Groening.) 
It goes in part: 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Sheriff of Yahoo County talkin', 
</P>
<P>
 If you're sellin' smutty rap, you better start walkin', 
</P>
<P>
 No use suin', no use squawkin', the judge sez I can come in and hush ya, 
</P>
<P>
 If U want free speech, go to Russia. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 From museums to movies to record stores, we're drying up America's sores, 
</P>
<P>
 A mind is a terrible thing to have without doors, 
</P>
<P>
 So don't make me come in and cuff and cuss ya,

POP EYE: THE KNACK JOINS ROCK'S LAZARUS BRIGADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is this what the Righteous Brothers meant by rock and roll heaven? All of a 
sudden bands we thought were long gone are coming back to life. 
</P>
<P>
The Zombies are coming back from the crypt, putting together a new album in 
England called "The Return of the Zombies." Seals &amp; Crofts are back in the 
studio, writing songs again. The Eagles, as noted here earlier, are plotting a 
1991 reunion tour. The Allman Brothers have gotten back together and put out a 
new album. Even Asia (England's answer to Toto) has re-formed, with a new 
single out called "Days Like These" and a Geffen album due to follow. 
</P>
<P>
And guess who else is reuniting? Would you believe . . . the Knack? That's 
right -- the original princes of skinny-tied power-pop have signed a deal with 
Virgin Records' hip sister label, Charisma Records, and are making a new album 
with hot producer Don Was. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Knack reunion so fascinating is that it presents Charisma with a 
knotty dilemma. Is it possible to revive the career of a band who rocketed to 
the top of the charts with the 1979 hit "My Sharona," but went down in flames 
almost as quickly, blasted by rock critics as arrogant one-album wonders? 
</P>
<P>
The Knack had such an image problem that when its reps first played the band's 
tape for Charisma A&amp;R vice president Jeff Fenster, they wouldn't even 
reveal the group's identity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true -- I didn't know who they were the first time I heard the tape," 
Fenster said. "In fact, Danny Goodwin (another Charisma A&amp;R exec) and I 
played the tape for (Charisma chief) Phil Quartararo and (Virgin chiefs) Jeff 
Ayeroff and Jordan Harris without telling them who the group was either. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, being smart guys, they knew we must've had a good reason why we 
didn't tell them. One of them -- and I won't tell you who -- actually guessed 
that it was the Knack." 
</P>
<P>
Fenster acknowledges that bringing the Knack back to life is a marketing 
challenge. "They obviously came to represent things -- like the whole 
skinny-tie thing -- that heaped a lot of baggage on them that they really 
didn't deserve. We know they'll receive a lot of scrutiny, but we're convinced 
their music is so good that they'll hold up under it." 
</P>
<P>
Fenster insists the band has one key pop institution in its corner -- rock 
radio. "We've talked to a lot of radio people and they still love the Knack. In 
fact, both AOR and classic-rock stations still play Knack songs all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The band, which consists of original members Doug Fieger, Berton Averre and 
Prescott Niles (with Billy Ward replacing drummer Bruce Gary), isn't worried 
about the rock-crit reaction this time around. "I really don't have any 
trepidations," said Feiger. "That was a long time ago. We're a music group 
trying to entertain an audience and I just hope people will judge on the merits 
of the music." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is so optimistic about the Knack's future -- or the other pop 
comebacks. "Most of these people are desperate," said Cliff Burnstein, who 
manages Metallica and Def Leppard. "You have to believe all this is just 
motivated by money. I mean, what can Don Henley say with the Eagles that he 
couldn't say by himself?" 
</P>
<P>
Concert promoter Brian Murphy also gives long odds for these comebacks. "A 
reunion has to be an event for it to really work," said Murphy, who runs Avalon 
Attractions. "If the Eagles do a tour, that would be an event. But the Knack? 
They were the Bobby Shermans of their age -- they had one hit and they were 
gone. Without any kind of strong audience loyalty, it's definitely going to be 
an uphill climb."

FREE SPEECH II: Rock's leading heavy-metal voice, RIP magazine, also takes on 
anti-rock crusaders with its September "Rock Censorship Special" issue. (The 
magazine's cover is a classic, featuring Ozzy Osbourne with a warning sticker 
plastered over his mouth.) 
</P>
<P>
The issue features a host of artist perspectives on censorship from the likes 
of Metallica's Lars Ulrich, Jane's Addiction's Perry Farrell, Frank Zappa and 
Axl Rose, who sagely notes that everybody knows "that the Mona Lisa is art -- 
well, so is Led Zeppelin." But our favorite quote comes from Ozzy, who has been 
taken to court by parents alleging that his song "Suicide Solution" caused a 
teen-ager to take his life. Bemoaning the fact that he's always been the focus 
of anti-rock tirades, Ozzy complains: "When I die, it will be 'There lies Ozzy 
Osbourne, who sent more people to their graves than Adolf Hitler!' . . . Just 
last week someone else shot himself and has blamed me! I believe in God. I am 
not a devil worshiper. My kids don't sleep in the attic, hanging upside down on 
rafters."

TAIWANESE ABORTION DEBATE BLENDS MODERN VALUES AND FOLK BELIEFS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDDHISM: A TAIPEI TEMPLE IS IN CHARGE OF HUNDREDS OF INFANT GHOSTS AS GROWING 
NUMBERS TERMINATE PREGNANCIES. 
</P>

TAIPEI, Taiwan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tsai Sung-Hui, pastor of one of Taipei's most popular Buddhist temples, is 
personally in charge of hundreds of infant ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
His Mercy Temple offers help to the growing number of Taiwan women who have 
taken the painful decision to abort a pregnancy: For a fee it will care for the 
souls of the aborted babies and ensure that they do not return to haunt their 
mothers. 
</P>
<P>
The temple says its "baby spirit" program helps handle a supernatural problem 
created by Taiwan's headlong rush to "modernity"; as more women shrug off 
traditional ideas about sex, the abortion rate has skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
But Tsai's temple has created a rare debate in Taiwan's normally serene 
Buddhist community, as nuns and scholars accuse him of using religion to cheat 
distraught women. 
</P>
<P>
"He tries to terrorize women," said Chao Hui, a Buddhist nun who has led the 
drive against the Mercy Temple. "He uses their feelings of sorrow and guilt to 
make money." 
</P>
<P>
The argument over "baby spirits" is typical of modern Taiwan, where age-old 
folk beliefs exist side by side with the latest technology. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen take care to position their computers in such a way as not to 
offend the gods, and secretaries from air-conditioned office blocks scurry to 
temples on their lunch break to light incense. 
</P>
<P>
Baby spirits are not new to Taiwan's believers, but reports of hauntings have 
become more common as the abortion rate rises. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan legalized abortion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Taipei Family Planning Center said 110,000 abortions were registered last 
year on the island of 20 million people, many of whom are too embarrassed to 
buy contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Kang, secretary of the center, said the real number of abortions is 
probably higher because many private clinics and doctors do not report 
abortions to health authorities. "We can definitely say abortion is on the 
rise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added, "People still have problems with it. Otherwise, why would there be 
all this fuss about baby spirits?" 
</P>
<P>
According to the Mercy Temple, the spirits of aborted babies harass the living 
in a number of ways, ranging from disturbing sleep with spectral cries to 
ruining business deals, souring love affairs and prompting suicides. 
</P>
<P>
"Because they are not properly cared for, infant spirits cannot be reincarnated 
and turn hateful. They often cause troubles in the material world," the temple 
said in one of its advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
People who fear they are being plagued by baby spirits have a number of 
options. Many women simply hope that contributions to the Mercy Temple will 
placate the ghosts and solve their problems. 
</P>
<P>
For a fee of $110 the temple will name the "unborn child," light incense for 
its soul twice a day and hold special religious services four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
Some people, however, find spirit babies more expensive. One Taipei executive 
in a high-technology company felt it necessary to rent an apartment to house 
the ghosts of several unborn children he believed were preventing his wife from 
conceiving again. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Buddhist Establishment has taken pains to distance itself from the 
Mercy Temple, saying "baby spirits" are not part of traditional Buddhist 
doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
"(This) is not only not a part of local belief, it actually conflicts with 
local belief," Chang Hsun, a researcher at Academica Sinica, wrote in an essay. 
</P>
<P>
"They are twisting the Buddhist concept of reincarnation. . . . They are 
oversimplifying the whole issue of life and death," said Chao, an officer of 
the Buddhist Assn. of the Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
Tsai resists the strict interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is to say what is Buddhist? There are many different kinds of Buddhism," 
he said in a brief telephone interview before hanging up.

<P>
Twenty-four members of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere's party in Parliament 
once worked for the Stasi, the now-disbanded secret police in East Germany, two 
newspapers reported Saturday. A key party official denied the reports. 
</P>
<P>
The East Berlin newspaper Der Morgen, in reporting on the alleged connection, 
said it based its information on a letter sent to 24 members of the Christian 
Democratic Union faction in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Der Morgen said the 24 received a letter from Guenter Krause, the party's 
parliamentary faction chairman, in which he asked them not to take on any 
"important political mandate" in a future all-German parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the letter followed background checks on all 
parliamentarians for possible Stasi connections. 
</P>
<P>
Der Morgen said several high-ranking party leaders confirmed the letter's 
existence. A respected Munich-based newspaper, Sueddeutsche Zeitung, carried a 
similar report. 
</P>
<P>
Neither newspaper named the 24 parliamentarians in question. The Christian 
Democrats won 164 seats in the 400-seat Parliament in East Germany's first free 
election on March 18 following a democratic revolution.

RECONSTRUCTION OF A WORLD WAR I TRENCH HAS EVERYTHING BUT THE SMELL OF DEATH

<P>
Guns rumble in the dark and tracer bullets cut across no man's land. Smoke 
hangs in the air, mingled with the smells of cordite and frying bacon. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was back," Tommy Keele, a 96-year-old veteran of World War I, said 
at the opening in June of a reconstructed trench of the Western Front. 
</P>
<P>
Then he added: "The smell of death -- that's not here." 
</P>
<P>
Keele was among guests invited to the unveiling of the Imperial War Museum's 
latest attempt to convey the atmosphere of war to generations that have never 
known it. 
</P>
<P>
Britain is caught up in memories of World War II this summer. Keele, who fought 
in both wars, said his recollections of World War I, and the slaughter of the 
trenches, were the more vivid. 
</P>
<P>
"Two of my mates were buried under us by a shell," he said. "We dug them out, 
horribly mangled, and buried them along the trench. As I pulled one, he fell to 
pieces. The smell of death was all over me and I couldn't eat or drink for 
three days." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Imperial War Museum opened a reconstruction of a World War II 
air raid shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have gone farther back, to what it was like for the infantry at the 
Battle of the Somme in 1916," said Alan Borg, the museum's director. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to get the trench as right as we could. We found the only machine 
left which could sew sandbags the way they were made in that war, because the 
method of sewing was changed in the 1920s. And we went to the old Somme 
battlefield in France and brought back two bags of earth to get the texture 
right for the sides of our trench." 
</P>
<P>
Baron Hermann von Richthofen, the West German ambassador and a descendant of 
German air ace Manfred von Richthofen, the "Red Baron," attended the opening 
ceremony.

<P>
The impact of a battlefield is created with life-size models of soldiers 
carrying real guns, bayonets and gas masks. There are even stuffed rats. 
</P>
<P>
In the freezing early hours of an October morning, a soldier in a niche in the 
sandbagged wall fries bacon over a brazier while a recorded Yorkshire voice 
reads a genuine letter home. 
</P>
<P>
"You asked what life is like in the trenches," the soldier wrote to his father. 
"It is very boring most of the time. We sleep in the day as there's not much to 
be had at night. You share house and home with rats and burn lice out of the 
seat of your pants with candles." 
</P>
<P>
Two sentries light cigarettes. A Lewis gun fires tracers. A shell has just 
exploded, demolishing sandbags and pouring fumes into the narrow trench. 
</P>
<P>
Artillery roars in the distance. Commands and cries ring out from a dawn attack 
by soldiers going "over the top." A soldier with head and chest wounds groans. 
</P>
<P>
In a dugout lie relics from the Western Front: barbed wire cutters, gas masks, 
a rattle to warn of a poison gas attack, ammunition boxes, a sniper shield, a 
windup phonograph, canned milk and postcards. 
</P>
<P>
Four periscopes show no man's land from 100 yards to 2 miles in a vista created 
from contemporary photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Cyril Dennys, 93, fought in the 1917 Battle of Passchendaele. He recalled that 
65,000 tons of shells fired in 17 days to soften up the enemy also destroyed 
the drainage system of the level Flemish plain. 
</P>
<P>
The attack began and raged for weeks in pitiless rain; men drowned in the mud. 
Britain lost 300,000 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors leaving the trench see a display case containing the four penciled 
sheets of the last letter to his wife, Lizzie, from Pvt. Jack Mudd of the 
London Regiment, and the red poppy he sent home from a Flanders field. 
</P>
<P>
He put nine crosses for kisses after his signature. 
</P>
<P>
"God bless you and my children and may He soon send me back to those I love is 
the wish of your faithful husband, Jack," is the last sentence of the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd was killed at Ypres on Oct. 26, 1917.

AFGHANISTAN MERCHANTS TURN CIVIL WAR CHAOS INTO SMUGGLERS' PARADISE

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven years ago, Sarajuddin Aryobi was a small-time merchant struggling with 
the family livestock business. Then the Soviet army entered Afghanistan and 
Aryobi struck it rich. 
</P>
<P>
Mohamad Fariq's transport business barely paid expenses in 1975. Thanks to the 
12-year-old civil war between the Soviet-backed government and Muslim 
guerrillas, Fariq now owns 250 trucks. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate his success, and display it, Fariq recently yanked out a front 
tooth and replaced it with a gold one. 
</P>
<P>
War and political chaos have created a smugglers' paradise. 
</P>
<P>
The flood of more than 5 million Afghan refugees to Pakistan, Iran, Dubai, 
Western Europe and the United States has caused great misery, but from it has 
blossomed a global network of import-export businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
Truckers, currency dealers, buyers and sellers are scattered around the world, 
and making money has become even easier since the government in Kabul discarded 
Marxist theory. 
</P>
<P>
Kabul's streets are lined with car repair shops that switch steering wheels 
from the left to the right so vehicles can be sold in Pakistan and India. 
Towers of new truck tires awaiting re-export stand like totem poles in alleys 
of the old city's bazaar. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business climate is better than paradise," former Finance Minister H. H. 
Tarzi said in an interview. "I myself would like to be an Afghan businessman." 
</P>
<P>
Before the war, Afghanistan was dirt poor. Its per capita gross national 
product, $115, was among the world's lowest. Twelve years of war and the failed 
communist experiment has made the country even poorer. 
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan has no heavy industry and its natural gas wells have been capped 
for more than a year. Its only exports are traditional: carpets, dried fruit 
and karakul, the curly fleeced skin of newborn lambs. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the game in Afghanistan is re-export -- which usually means 
smuggling -- to Pakistan, Iran and India. 
</P>
<P>
Aryobi's firm, Saraj Trading Co., operates from a mud-brick courtyard off an 
alley in Kabul. He estimates that $1 billion worth of goods are smuggled to 
Pakistan, India and Iran each year. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, re-export to the Soviet Union hovered around $400 million a 
year, said Aryobi, who got into the import-export business by selling Japanese 
TVs to Soviet soldiers. The Soviet trade dropped to about $50 million when the 
Soviet army left in February, 1989, after more than nine years in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Smuggling profits don't stay long in Afghanistan. Aryobi uses Deutschebank in 
Frankfurt and Fariq, his trucker, has accounts with Chase Manhattan in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Afghan businessmen can make a success of smuggling because the economies of 
Pakistan, Iran and India remain generally closed to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Pakistan and India won independence from Britain in 1947, they have 
tried to protect local industry by imposing huge tariffs on imported goods. 
</P>
<P>
Customs duties are 150% for tires and can reach 200% for television sets. 
Iranian tariffs also are high. 
</P>
<P>
Some countries, like Japan, make things better; others, like China, make them 
cheaper. Enter the smuggling Afghans. 
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan always has been a marketplace. Centuries before Christ, traders 
crisscrossed its mountains on their way to the Middle East and Asia. Silk 
routes to China passed through Afghanistan, and Chinese curios still turn up in 
the dusty junk shops of Kabul's Chicken Street. 
</P>
<P>
Before the civil war, an estimated 50% of Afghanistan's imports were 
re-exported. Now, with the collapse of the economy, the Chamber of Commerce 
says about 95% of imports are shipped out again. 
</P>
<P>
The business centers on the aging warehouses along the muddy Kabul River. 
</P>
<P>
Trucks heavy with goods inch out of dusty alleys and bounce over potholed 
streets. Boys prod tires with pressure gauges. Drivers with full black beards 
and wildly colored turbans check their AK-47s, firing rounds into the air. 
</P>
<P>
A year after the Soviet army arrived in December, 1979, Aryobi abandoned his 
livestock business for import-export. A chance meeting with a Japanese 
businessmen brought him his first shipment of television sets. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, Aryobi says, about 500,000 TVs have moved through his riverside 
warehouses to neighboring Pakistan and some have gone on to India. He also 
re-exports 100,000 pairs of tires a year, usually Indian tires to Pakistan and 
Japanese to India. 
</P>
<P>
Aryobi, 35, does not flaunt his wealth, but 43-year-old Fariq is nouveau riche, 
his shirt unbuttoned, barrel chest draped in golden chains, fingers laden with 
rings of lapis lazuli. 
</P>
<P>
When Fariq replaced the tooth with gold last year, he didn't use a painkiller. 
"I wanted to feel my wealth," he said, flashing a newly metallic smile. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Aryobi's profits became a political liability. The communist regime of 
Babrak Karmal imprisoned him for "price gouging" and he spent nearly three 
years in solitary confinement. 
</P>
<P>
The government's attitude toward business began to change after 1986, when the 
Soviets installed Najibullah, who uses only one name, as president. 
</P>
<P>
Under a policy called National Reconciliation, Najibullah returned to the 
traditional Afghan way of solving problems. Merchants, tribes and local 
militias were given autonomy as long as they pledged loyalty to the government. 
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's central bank recognized the bustling currency market in Kabul's 
old city. State monopolies on sugar and food transport ended and some state-run 
firms were sold to private investors. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest boon came when the state-run Afghan Cart Co. began to encourage 
smuggling by selling merchants licenses to import goods, including televisions 
and other electronic items. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed the money," explained Tarzi, the former finance minister. More than 
15% of government revenues now come from sales of such licenses. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Aryobi deal illustrates the intricacies of Afghan re-export. 
</P>
<P>
In early February, a Pakistani trader wanted to smuggle Indian tires from 
Afghanistan to Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
He went to Peshawar, Pakistan, and deposited 50% of the purchase price with a 
currency dealer, a refugee from Afghanistan. The currency dealer sent a telex 
to his uncle in Kabul's currency market, authorizing him to pay Aryobi the 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Aryobi, who doesn't like to keep money in Kabul, transferred a portion to his 
bank in West Germany through Afghan money dealers in Dubai. He got in touch 
with Fariq and, within a week, drivers were hauling Indian tires east to 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
On the way, the trucks passed through hostile territory, controlled by Afghan 
rebels. Truckers paid off the guerrillas, who operated ad hoc "toll booths" 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
The tires arrived at the frontier at night and were smuggled into a warehouse. 
The next morning, a string of pickup trucks moved them to Pakistan's biggest 
city, Karachi, where they were sold. The Pakistani trader then paid the balance 
in Peshawar. 
</P>
<P>
"We always work like this," Aryobi said, fingering copies of the telex traffic. 
"It's pure trust. That's the Muslim way."

FEW GAINS FOR LAROUCHE CANDIDATES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE LEADER OF THE GROUP HAS LOWERED HIS SIGHTS. HE IS WAGING A 
JAILHOUSE CAMPAIGN FOR CONGRESS.

<P>
Imprisoned political extremist Lyndon LaRouche and his followers are running in 
scores of primary and general election races this year as they try to regroup 
politically after a string of legal defeats. 
</P>
<P>
LaRouche followers stunned and embarrassed the Democratic Party in 1986 by 
winning primary nominations for two statewide offices in Illinois. But this 
time around, the organization's candidates appear to be having little success. 
</P>
<P>
After running for President four times, both as a Democrat and independent, 
LaRouche has lowered his sights to a jailhouse campaign for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
One of his top lieutenants, Nancy Spannaus, is waging an independent campaign 
for the U.S. Senate in Virginia and is the only candidate running against GOP 
Sen. John W. Warner this fall. State Democratic leaders rebuffed her bid for 
the party's nomination -- deciding instead to nominate no one. 
</P>
<P>
LaRouche is serving a 15-year federal prison sentence in Minnesota for fraud 
and tax evasion. He is running as an independent candidate in Virginia's 10th 
District, in the Washington suburbs, against Republican Rep. Frank R. Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need an analyst to tell you LaRouche doesn't have much popular 
support. But they know the political process," said University of Virginia 
political scientist Larry Sabato. "It doesn't constitute an endorsement of 
LaRouche or his policies, but they will inherit votes simply by being on the 
ballot, and they will undoubtedly claim some great movement." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from a few minor victories in Texas, and a candidate who got 25% of the 
vote in losing a statewide primary there, LaRouche candidates haven't gained 
much notice. 
</P>
<P>
"We just consider him and his candidates more of a nuisance now, rather than a 
threat," said Ginny Terzano at the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The success of LaRouche candidates in the 1986 Illinois primary sparked a party 
effort to warn voters away from LaRouche and his nightmare conspiracy theories, 
which some say carry anti-Semitic themes. It also brought new public scrutiny 
to his financial network of corporate shells and high-pressure fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
LaRouche and six of his associates, including Spannaus's husband, Edward, were 
convicted in December of 1988. The case stemmed from an investigation into more 
than $30 million in loans raised from individuals by LaRouche's organization. 
Prosecutors said the group used heavy-handed tactics and had no intent to repay 
the money it borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis King, who has investigated the LaRouche organization for more than a 
decade and is the author of a book, "Lyndon LaRouche and the New American 
Fascism," says the group receded immediately after the convictions but has 
strongly rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
"They have made a rather remarkable comeback," King said. "I don't get the 
impression the Democratic Party is paying much attention to this, and they may 
be in for an unpleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Debra Freeman, LaRouche's spokeswoman, estimated that thousands of 
LaRouche-connected candidates are running nationally. She characterized 
LaRouche's House bid as the organization's "flagship candidacy." 
</P>
<P>
LaRouche candidates often fare best in races that attract little attention. 
</P>
<P>
Some LaRouche followers have won small, uncontested party posts in Texas, and 
another ran unopposed to win the Democratic nomination for Congress in the 
state's safely Republican 22nd District. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas' Democratic Senate primary, LaRouche follower Harley Schlanger lost to 
state Sen. Hugh Parmer, who is seeking to oust Republican Phil Gramm. But 
Schlanger pulled in 247,205 votes -- a number that the LaRouche organization 
claimed was a victory in itself. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials and others say the LaRouche candidates don't have to 
win to succeed. Even losing campaigns generate publicity and serve as a source 
of fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
"This business of running for office is one of the techniques LaRouche people 
use," said Newbold Smith of Paoli, Pa. Smith's son, Lewis DuPont Smith, is a 
LaRouche follower and independent candidate for Congress in Pennsylvania's 5th 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"One, to feed the egos of the people. That's important. This is a cult," the 
elder Smith said. "Second, it does bring the publicity. They don't care whether 
the publicity is favorable or unfavorable. And, it allows them to raise money." 
</P>
<P>
Newbold Smith and other family members won a court order declaring the son 
legally incompetent after the younger Smith -- an heir to the DuPont fortune -- 
turned over much of his money to LaRouche's organization. 
</P>
<P>
Reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show LaRouche had raised 
$222,348 for his congressional campaign as of April. His separate National 
Democratic Policy Committee reported debts of $486,934. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors argued in court during LaRouche's trial that his followers 
raised money by promising it would be used for specific purposes, such as 
political efforts, when they knew the money would be used for other purposes, 
including supporting him. 
</P>
<P>
John B. Russell Jr., Virginia senior assistant attorney general, said a state 
investigation indicates that much of the LaRouche group's money is being sent 
to its foreign operations. These include one based in West Germany, where 
LaRouche's wife, Helga, is believed to live. 
</P>
<P>
Five of LaRouche's followers have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to state 
charges in Virginia.

PRO-MARIJUANA CANDIDATES BEGIN CROPPING UP

Gubernatorial candidate Gatewood Galbraith wants to put the law back on the 
side of a Kentucky agricultural tradition: growing marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
"Our granddaddies used to grow it by the thousands of acres" when marijuana was 
legal and grown mainly for fiber for rope and textiles, said Galbraith, a 
43-year-old Lexington attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Galbraith, a long shot in next year's Kentucky race for governor, is among a 
handful of pro-legalization candidates who consider themselves political 
trailblazers for millions of Americans who smoke pot regularly. 
</P>
<P>
They also style themselves as champions for the taxpayers who are footing the 
bill for the nation's war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In New Hampshire, congressional candidate Michael Weddle is challenging voters 
to heed their state motto -- "Live Free or Die" -- by supporting marijuana 
legalization. Weddle, a state representative, is among eight candidates in a 
GOP primary for an open U.S. House seat. 
</P>
<P>
In Kansas, Democratic congressional candidate Mark Creamer now operates his 
pro-legalization campaign from a jail cell, where he is serving a six-month 
sentence for lighting a marijuana cigarette in a police station. Creamer is 
given little chance against Democratic Rep. Jim Slattery in the state's Aug. 7 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Zeese, vice president of the private, pro-legalization Drug Policy 
Foundation in Washington, said several other major-party candidates also are 
carrying the marijuana legalization banner this year. 
</P>
<P>
Zeese said incumbent officeholders who support marijuana legalization and are 
running for reelection include U.S. Rep. George W. Crockett Jr. (D-Mich.); 
Democratic state Rep. Elbert Walton in Missouri; Democratic state Sen. Joe 
Galiber in New York; and Bill Mathesius, the Republican county executive in 
Mercer County, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Zeese believes the political winds have changed since the conservative tide 
swept the nation during the 1980s, dousing the marijuana legalization debates 
of the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Some politicians are starting to get ahead of the curve on this," Zeese said. 
"Something like this was unspeakable three years ago and now people are running 
for office on it." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of legalization include conservatives such as economist Milton 
Friedman and columnist William F. Buckley Jr. Other proponents are former Atty. 
Gen. Ramsey Clark, Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke and U.S. District Judge Robert 
W. Sweet in New York. Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz has said 
legalization should at least be considered. 
</P>
<P>
Many supporters of legalization say marijuana is less potent and addictive than 
cigarettes or alcohol, and shouldn't be grouped with cocaine, heroin, crack or 
other hard drugs. They also contend that legalizing marijuana would be a big 
weapon against crime syndicates that control the drug world. 
</P>
<P>
But federal drug policy director William J. Bennett has branded legalization 
"stupid and morally atrocious." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make any sense," Bennett has said. "It is becoming something of a 
fashion to believe this (legalization) in certain circles of opinion. But even 
though it's fashionable, it's still every bit as dumb and compassionless as it 
was before." 
</P>
<P>
Dewey Stokes, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said 
legalizing marijuana would prompt more people to develop drug habits and 
increase demand for harder drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the anti-drug effort has to be successful if we're going to have a 
country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky Democratic leaders have taken steps recently to distance themselves 
from Galbraith and a new grass-roots organization called the "Green Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
Galbraith, Weddle and Creamer all face long odds at the polls this year. But 
legalization supporters express confidence that their numbers will grow as 
opposition mounts to the costs of a federal anti-drug policy they deem 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
"As the repression continues and the erosion of civil liberties continue . . . 
so will the awareness that solving the problem with a drug war is not the 
solution," said Weddle, a two-term state House member from Portsmouth, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
Weddle, a Democrat who turned Republican for the September primary, said voter 
response has been better than he expected. 
</P>
<P>
In Kentucky, where marijuana outstrips tobacco as the leading -- albeit illegal 
-- cash crop, Galbraith said the response has been "absolutely stunning" to his 
proposal to strictly regulate and tax marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Galbraith, who is among five announced or likely candidates for the Democratic 
nomination for governor next year, estimates that the state could reap up to $1 
billion in taxes each year from legal marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
He said Kentucky was the nation's leading producer of marijuana -- which was 
commonly called hemp -- for a century before it was banned in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
John Dunlap, a spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of 
Marijuana Laws in Washington, said legalizing marijuana would generate $40 
billion a year nationally. Billions more could be saved by scrapping local, 
state and federal eradication efforts, he said.

YELLOWSTONE'S FIRE CREWS GUARD EVEN A SINGLE TREE

YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a lightning bolt sent flames crackling from a cottonwood tree in 
Yellowstone National Park, half a dozen firefighters responded within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
They were too late; the fire had been reduced to embers by heavy rain from the 
storm that got it going. But ever since blazes blackened nearly half of 
Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres during the dry, hot summer of 1988, even a 
single burning tree quickly draws firefighters' attention. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily criticized "let it burn" plan under which fires caused by nature 
were left untouched unless they endangered people or structures has been 
suspended and is under review. 
</P>
<P>
This year, firefighters have fought about a dozen fires, most of which were a 
quarter-acre or smaller and several of which involved just one tree. 
</P>
<P>
The costs are high. The summer's biggest fire, spotted July 5 near Yellowstone 
River, was contained at 220 acres by 315 firefighters, and the bill is expected 
to be around $750,000, said park spokeswoman Marsha Karle. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have a big one where we bring in overhead and we bring in outside 
crews, that's where it adds up real quick," she said. "Any time you call in 
outside resources -- retardant drops, smoke jumpers, helicopters, crews -- it 
adds to the cost. Firefighting is an expensive business." 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the 1988 blazes, public and political outrage prompted the 
Interior Department to go back to its pre-1972 policy of fighting all fires. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also mobilized a U.S. Forest Service-National Park Service team to 
analyze the "let it burn" policy. The team found the policy to be basically 
sound but asked for some refinements. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Frye, a park ranger, said the proposed revisions, if adopted, will leave 
little room for guesswork when rangers decide which fires to fight. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers would have to take into account recent rainfall, humidity, fuel 
moisture, wind speed, fuel types and the slope of the forest floor when 
deciding whether to fight fires, Frye said. 
</P>
<P>
These factors have been considered in the past, but there were no predetermined 
limits that they had to fall within, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always so complicated. 
</P>
<P>
During the park's first 100 years, rangers battled every fire they could reach.

Then in 1972, the National Park Service agreed to manage natural areas of 
Yellowstone as "vignettes of primitive America" and adopted the "let it burn" 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
From 1972 to 1987, the policy guided action over 235 fires that burned roughly 
34,000 acres, according to park records. 
</P>
<P>
How soon the park's firefighters will be given leeway in deciding which fires 
to fight, and which to leave alone, is difficult to gauge, Frye said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fire management plan is in the regional forester's office for review at 
this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If an environmental assessment of the revisions is required, the plan may not 
take effect until next summer, Frye said.

S.D. RIDERS WORRY, BUT TROLLEY CRIME IS NEAR ZERO; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: RECENT VIOLENCE IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THE SYSTEM CROSSES PROMPTS 
CONCERN AMONG OFFICIALS AS WELL.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Around dusk on July 4, the man boarded the trolley and sat down. He carried 
with him a large satchel, which he later told police contained the makings of a 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
At the corner of 12th and Imperial avenues, the trolley exploded with gunfire. 
The "celebration" came from a 12-gauge shotgun, which, in discharging 
accidentally, ripped a hole through the satchel and penetrated the wall of the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
The man was arrested at the 47th Street Station in Southeast San Diego. No one 
was injured, but the firing of the gun raised a serious concern: 
</P>
<P>
How safe is the San Diego Trolley? 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, the answer is clear. The number of reported crimes occurring on 
or near the trolley is extremely low. Langley Powell, president and general 
manager of San Diego Trolley Inc., said the service incurs .25 incidents of 
crime per 100,000 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
But Powell said figures don't tell the full story. On any mass transit system, 
feelings and perceptions are almost as critical as statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Trolley officials are concerned about what appears to be a growing apprehension 
among riders about the safety of the trolley, in part because it passes through 
some of the highest crime neighborhoods of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are somewhat apprehensive, and that concerns us," Powell said. 
"But we've provided a level of security that we hope eases that to a certain 
degree." 
</P>
<P>
Powell said that since its inception on July 26, 1981, the trolley has hired 
Heritage Security Services of Loma Portal to police its 16-mile South Line. 
(The 18 1/2-mile East Line was added in 1989.) Fifteen guards were hired in 
1981, and just recently -- after the shotgun incident -- the 39th was added. 
They work at random locations throughout the network -- on foot, in patrol 
cars, on the trolleys, in parking lots and depots -- from 4:45 a.m., when the 
trains roll out, to 1:45 a.m., when they stop. 
</P>
<P>
The operators of the trolley face a much different situation than that in Los 
Angeles, where 108 county sheriff's deputies were recently hired to work the 
new light rail Blue Line, which follows a 19-mile route from Long Beach to Pico 
Boulevard in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. George Saldamando, who heads the street gang unit for the San Diego Police 
Department, said that any amount of gang activity along San Diego's East or 
South line is nothing compared to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles and San Diego are completely different when it comes to gangs," 
Saldamando said. "In L.A., it's not uncommon to have a dozen gang-related 
homicides in a weekend. There it's a tremendous problem, almost uncontrollable. 
So crime along the Blue Line was a huge concern." 
</P>
<P>
Despite three recent gang-related shootings near trolley stations in Southeast 
San Diego, Saldamando said, the service is safe and, at the moment, not at risk 
because of gang activity in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Tereschuck, vice president in charge of security for San Diego Trolley, 
said that, although no one from a law enforcement agency has been hired to work 
for the service, law enforcement officers do assist as advisers and were 
instrumental in picking Heritage Security Services. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that, when the trolley opened, "security was not the concern it 
now represents." The growth of the system -- and the growth of the city and 
county -- have made it a higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth has been phenomenal," Tereschuck said. "We've gone from a 15.9-mile 
system to a 35-mile system. We've gone from seven or eight park-and-ride 
centers to twice that many. We first parked 1,000 cars a day (in trolley 
station parking lots). Now we park twice that many. Our passenger load has 
increased from 12,000 a day to more than 50,000 on a typical weekday." 
</P>
<P>
Almost a decade after cars began rolling from the Santa Fe depot to San Ysidro, 
the East Line opened in June of last year. Just recently, the Bayside Line 
opened, connecting Seaport Village, the Gaslamp Quarter and the San Diego 
Convention Center to C Street. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the low crime figures, do people feel safe on the trolley? 
</P>
<P>
Tereschuck said the "question of perception is difficult to answer." He said 
much of the mail he gets is from people who marvel at the system's security, 
while others complain heatedly about having had their cars stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"Perception is most affected by what's happened to you," Tereschuck said. 
</P>
<P>
Trolley station parking lots report about a dozen stolen cars a month. But 
Tereschuck noted that "one out of every 42 people in the county can expect to 
have their car stolen during the time they live here. Compared to that, I'd say 
our stats are great. But, even so, I want perception to be consistent with the 
record. That's what we're striving for." 
</P>
<P>
Although San Diego is no match for Los Angeles in gangs, Tereschuck said they 
are a concern. 
</P>
<P>
On a wall near the trolley station at 54th Street and Imperial Avenue, large 
red graffiti visible from passing cars read "Crips!" 
</P>
<P>
Powell noted one recent incident in which a trolley car was almost strafed by 
gunfire during a shoot-out between rival gang members near the 47th Street 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of graffiti, slashed seats and broken windows -- the bane of mass 
transit -- Powell said the trolley's policy is to remove or fix such problems 
immediately. If a cut seat or broken window can't be replaced at once, or 
graffiti removed before it spreads like a virus, the car is put out of service 
immediately. He calls the ploy "deliberately psychological" and says it works. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Leitner, spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transit Development Board, the 
agency that oversees the trolley, said there are more complaints about security 
during non-daylight-saving time months, when it gets darker earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Powell said some stops are more trouble than others. He named 12th Avenue and C 
Street near San Diego City College as among the worst; 47th Street is another. 
</P>
<P>
Near the city college, women students have reported being harassed by vagrants, 
both at the station and on the cars. Police say that drug dealing, especially 
of crack, is a problem at 12th and C. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy has cast a shadow on the 47th Street Station since the East Line 
started in 1989. Powell said the district is considering a redesign of the 
station. 
</P>
<P>
"The tracks are up high in comparison to the street," he said. "You have to 
climb this dark flight of stairs, and it makes people nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Powell said the trolley's most persistent crimes are graffiti, cut seats, 
broken windows and stolen automobiles. Tereschuck calls the incident of "a man 
on board with a gun" the most serious the trolley has faced. 
</P>
<P>
Tereschuck said that crimes committed in neighborhoods near the trolley are 
sometimes wrongly perceived as occurring on the trolley. He said a recent 
stabbing victim trudged from 25th and Imperial -- where the crime occurred -- 
to the tracks at 25th and Commercial, where his body was discovered by police. 
</P>
<P>
"The crime had nothing to do with the trolley, but it was perceived that way," 
Tereschuck said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the daughters of James Oliver Huberty, the gunman who killed 21 people 
in a San Ysidro McDonald's restaurant in 1984, was once quoted as saying that 
her father enjoyed "playing chicken" with the trolley with her on the back of 
his motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Powell said games of chicken are not uncommon. He said a sailor died near the L 
Street Station in Chula Vista in 1984, in what officials have since labeled a 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many riders interviewed by The Times expressed concern about 
security on the trolley. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:03 on a recent weeknight, Michael Byers boarded in La Mesa. Byers, a 
20-year-old salesman, takes the East Line several times a week from his home 
near Euclid Avenue to Grossmont Center, where he works. 
</P>
<P>
Byers said he's never experienced "real danger" on the trolley, "but a lot of 
weird things happen all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Byers was sitting across from a man who had a sweater draped over 
three walnut shells. When he and the stranger made eye contact, Byers said, the 
man swung the sweater over his shoulder, like a magician pulling back a cape to 
reveal a dove. 
</P>
<P>
"Guess which one the dollar bill is under," the man demanded. 
</P>
<P>
Byers guessed -- wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Guess again," the man said. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong again. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," the man said, "let's play double or nothing for $25. Let's see your $25 
first." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Byers got up and moved to another seat. 
</P>
<P>
Byers and a companion, Amos Johnson, 26, said fights often break out on-board. 
</P>
<P>
"One night, there was this really vicious one between three security officers 
and two other guys," Byers said. "I knew the guys had to be on something, 
because the way they went after these security guards was just insane. Here are 
these guards with guns and nightsticks and these idiots -- who have nothing but 
their hands to work with -- are going after these guys with everything they've 
got." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people who get on are in their own little world," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Many riders complained that "drunks and crazies" are, by far, the most annoying 
nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
On the South Line on a recent afternoon, a well-dressed man sat in a corner, 
looking out the window, talking only to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Another man tried, in vain, to engage anyone he could in conversation -- but 
only about horror movies, the bloodier and scarier the better. He announced, in 
a voice that seemed to rattle the windows, that Freddy Krueger should be the 
next President. 
</P>
<P>
A third man entered, tattooed from head to bare feet. Everyone tried to avoid 
looking at his face. 
</P>
<P>
Mike and Judy Noe may have summed up best what riding the trolley is like, 
almost 10 years down the line. The Noes, an East County couple, took the East 
Line recently from El Cajon Station to the Civic Center depot to see a play at 
Horton Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The Noes looked out of place around the midnight hour. They were quiet, 
well-dressed and circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
They said they ride the trolley whenever they venture downtown for a play or 
dinner, which is often.

LIFE DOESN'T IMITATE ART: BOY 'SUPER-HERO' RESCUED 
</P>

<P>
On television and in the movie, the wildly popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
rescue people in distress every day. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday night, it was firefighters who saved one of the super-heroes. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, they rescued a 13-year-old boy, dressed like one of the mutated 
humanoid turtles, who got wedged 15 feet down a neighbor's chimney in the 5600 
block of Wilhelmina Avenue in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid was playing a Ninja Turtle game," Los Angeles Police Sgt. Craig Aliano 
said. "I haven't the slightest idea what that is." 
</P>
<P>
The rescuers worked about 30 minutes before freeing the boy, who was not hurt, 
Firefighter Pat Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
They extended a ladder over the chimney and threw a rope attached to straps to 
the youth. 
</P>
<P>
When the boy, covered with soot, emerged from the chimney, he explained that he 
was playing a game with some other children. 
</P>
<P>
He wore goggles and a ski mask -- both turtle trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Ninja Turtles prefer sewers over chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
The turtles, named after classical artists, eat pizzas in their sewer digs and 
spend their days rescuing people. 
</P>
<P>
The turtles appear on one of television's hottest cartoon programs, and they 
recently starred in their own hit movie. 
</P>
<P>
The wanna-be teen-age turtle was taken to a police station but was quickly 
released to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid was just playing," Aliano said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nothing for us."

<P>
EDUCATION: A COUNTY PROGRAM TO HELP THE CHILDREN OF MIGRANT FARM WORKERS 
COMPLETE THEIR SCHOOLING IS PAVING THE WAY FROM SANTA CLARITA VALLEY FIELDS TO 
INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Just off California 126 near Val Verde, fields of parsley stretch across the 
horizon, creating an ocean of green. The beauty of the landscape eludes 
20-year-old Martha Celedon, who has spent much of her life trying to escape 
such fields. 
</P>
<P>
Now a junior at Cal State Northridge, Celedon worked from the age of 5 
alongside her parents and other fieldworkers picking, wrapping and packing 
onions for $2.20 a box. "I hated it," she said emphatically. "Even as a little 
girl, I would say I wanted to get a good education, a good job and take my 
parents away from the fields." 
</P>
<P>
Celedon credits a special program run by the Los Angeles County Office of 
Education for her successful journey from fieldworker to college student. "I 
don't think I would have made it to college without this program," she said. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Celedon returned to the Migrant Education Program, this time as an 
instructor's aide. "I have to give something back of what I received," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Celedon is not alone in her success. This past academic year, a record 45% of 
the 22 students who graduated from the migrant program in the Santa Clarita 
Valley went on to college. Nationally, only about half of migrant laborers' 
children even graduate from high school. 
</P>
<P>
The 24 school districts in Los Angeles County that participate in the program 
serve 15,000 students, making it one of the largest and most comprehensive 
programs of its kind in the nation. In the Santa Clarita Valley, the Newhall 
School District, Castaic Union School District, William S. Hart Union High 
School District and Santa Clarita Community College District take part. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, the program has offered children of migrant workers enrichment 
classes, counseling and tutorials -- all designed to help them succeed in 
school and go on to college. The families of the 257 children served in the 
valley this year also receive health services and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
With the closing of several large farms in recent years, few of the students 
served in the valley still work in the fields, but educators say the itinerant 
lifestyle has left a lasting impact on them academically and on their families 
economically. 
</P>
<P>
Raul C. Almada, senior project director, said children of present and former 
migrant workers are some "of the most educationally disadvantaged students in 
our schools today." 
</P>
<P>
They often lag two to three years behind their classmates in basic skills and 
suffer from a lack of self-esteem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the problems are caused by the constant movement dictated by crop 
patterns. Others result from poverty. 
</P>
<P>
The program seems to be succeeding in overcoming those factors and helping 
young people such as Celedon prepare for college. Celedon first began attending 
the program's weekly Tuesday school when she was in the eighth grade. There she 
received assistance with homework and participated in rap sessions aimed at 
improving students' self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
The high school sessions exposed students to different careers. It was during 
one of these sessions -- a presentation by Latino students from CSUN -- that 
Celedon first considered going to college. 
</P>
<P>
"They really motivated me," she said. "They said, 'We need more Latinos earning 
degrees. . . . We know you can do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Program staff members helped Celedon apply to CSUN and obtain financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
Like other "at risk" students, migrant students need a support system at each 
level -- from elementary grades to the early years of college, said Carol 
Ramnarine, program specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Although the migrant program offers a range of services to students and their 
families, the major emphasis is on supplementary instruction through 
independent study courses and classes conducted in the evenings, on Saturdays 
and during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
At the evening classes, held at College of the Canyons in Valencia, for 
example, students ages 13 to 18 earn credit toward graduation for attending 3 
1/2 hours per week of individualized instruction in reading, language arts and 
math. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, counselors hired by the program regularly meet with the students 
to discuss attendance, progress toward graduation, college and career goals. 
Similar instruction and enrichment courses are available for younger students 
in the program's Saturday school. Summer sessions include field trips to 
museums, and an introduction to computers and performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
"They get the extra time and attention that they're not able to get in the 
school year," said Nori Rosenberg, an instructor in the program's Saturday and 
summer sessions. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, 80 elementary school students from the Santa Clarita Valley gather 
each day for courses at Castaic Elementary School, and 25 older students meet 
at a school in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgette Gonzales, 15, has been in the Migrant Education Program since seventh 
grade and said she doesn't mind spending her summers in school. "It's something 
you look forward to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgette beams when she talks about the four weeks she spent last summer on 
the USC campus as a student in METAS (Migrants Empowered to Achieve Success), 
an adjunct to the Migrant Education Program that focuses on preparing students 
for college and establishing a strong sense of self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"I got an A in everything," she said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Through METAS, 80 high school students from Migrant Education Programs 
throughout Los Angeles County are spending four weeks at USC this summer. The 
students study math, science, computers, drama and other subjects and live in 
the university's dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
"If you give them high expectations, they achieve," said Ignacio Rojas Jr., 
METAS coordinator. "What we do is tell them that they have the power to do it." 
</P>
<P>
For Bridgette, the youngest of 12 children, the encouragement and motivation 
helped transform her from a failing student to one intent on going to college 
after she graduates from high school in two years. 
</P>
<P>
"It just changed my whole life," she said. "After I came out, I felt like I 
could do whatever I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Bridgette's and Celedon's families, and many other farm workers in the Santa 
Clarita Valley, had to find other kinds of work in 1987 when Boskovich Farms, a 
major employer, plowed under its onion fields in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
"The fieldworkers are having to move to other types of employment because the 
fields are closing," Ramnarine said. "They're not just passing through. They're 
becoming contributing members of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Programs such as the Migrant Education Program are needed to help the children 
of migrant farm workers make the transition, staff members said. 
</P>
<P>
One recent day, Arlene Medina, an aide in the program, made her rounds through 
the winding roads of Val Verde delivering bagged lunches and hope to the 
residents of this isolated community, where many of the farm workers live in 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
At one house, she gently scolded a student for not attending the program's 
summer school. At another, she helped a parent who does not speak English fill 
out a release form so her child can participate in a summer activity. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to stay on them," she said. "You can't let up. Education is really 
the only thing that is going to change their lives."

RESIDENTS BATTLE DEVELOPMENT PLAN AT MALIBOU LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETSY BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along the narrow roads that overlook glistening Malibou Lake, neighbors on 
horseback stop under the pine trees to argue about their community's future. 
</P>
<P>
Laid-back devotees of stained glass, hummingbird feeders and life far from 
mini-malls, the residents of this retreat in the Santa Monica Mountains, 20 
minutes south of the Ventura Freeway near Agoura Hills, are also spending their 
evenings poring over dull planning documents. 
</P>
<P>
And last week, about 50 residents, many of whom are nonconformist writers, 
artists and behind-the-scenes movie people who are throwbacks to the hippie era 
of the 1960s, met to plan strategy for blocking a proposed 15-house development 
that they fear would eventually lead to the destruction of their haven from 
urban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to decide the fate of 
the project Thursday, and the people who live in the cabins and fixer-uppers 
lining the narrow canyon roads agreed to sport ties instead of tie-dyes when 
they attend the meeting to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
The houses would be built on Crags Drive, the single road leading into the 
rugged neighborhood that is surrounded by canyons filled with dry, stubby 
brush. To win approval, the developer would be required to build a sewer that 
residents say would spur further growth. 
</P>
<P>
The residents say the area is already prone to fires and, because Crags Drive 
narrows to as little as 10 feet in places, it could not accommodate firetrucks 
and the cars of residents who would need to flee a major blaze. The residents, 
most of whose houses are served by septic tanks, also say the sewer system 
would add to the problem by encouraging growth on the 460 mapped lots that are 
vacant. 
</P>
<P>
"If they get sewers, it will make a bad situation worse," said homeowner Karen 
Grosswendt, who remembers the last time she was awakened by the sound of 
someone alerting residents to a fire. 
</P>
<P>
"As a community, we're very concerned about the small roads," Grosswendt said. 
"If a firetruck was trying to get up and people were trying to get out in their 
cars, there would be pandemonium." 
</P>
<P>
The residents got a major boost in April when the county Fire Department 
concluded that the single access road in the fire-prone area created "extremely 
dangerous conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The department also recommended that "no further development" be allowed "until 
proper roadway width and surfaces" are "installed and maintained throughout the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Former Los Angeles City Councilman Art Snyder, who represents developers Jack 
Slome and Donald Haskin, maintains that the small, "Western-theme" housing 
development being proposed for Malibou Lake would actually improve access for 
firetrucks because the single road would be widened substantially. 
</P>
<P>
"They're probably the only people in the area who will ever have the financial 
capability to improve the road so that people could evacuate in case of fire or 
another disaster," Snyder said of the developers. 
</P>
<P>
But the road, because it abuts steep slopes in places and is bordered closely 
by houses in others, could not be uniformly widened enough to meet county 
standards, said G. Greg Aftergood, a lawyer for the homeowners. Even the 188 
existing residences exceed the maximum allowed for a narrow single access road 
in a wildfire area. 
</P>
<P>
The property where the houses would be built was once occupied by a community 
center that fell into disrepair. The site is still zoned for commercial 
development. "All sorts of things could be put there that would be a lot less 
desirable than 15 very nice homes," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
The real reason behind homeowners' opposition, Snyder said, is that "some folks 
just don't want to have more neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Few in the neighborhood would dispute Snyder on that point. 
</P>
<P>
The area, from its founding in the 1920s as a retreat for film stars, has 
attracted people of independent mentality, said Susan Laronge, president of the 
Malibu Lakeside Homeowners Assn., and they cringe at the idea of tract houses. 
</P>
<P>
"The area continues to draw the creative, the innovative and the stubbornly 
independent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The residents cannot even agree on spelling. The owners of houses on Malibou 
Lake disagree with their neighbors up the hill, who refer to their neighborhood 
as "Malibu Lakeside." 
</P>
<P>
An early hangout of W. C. Fields, the Malibou Lake community became home in the 
1960s to rock musicians such as the Grateful Dead and the Byrds, hippie 
communes and motorcycle gangs. Charles Manson is rumored to have camped with 
his followers in the nearby hills. 
</P>
<P>
"The area in the '60s was very colorful, communal," Laronge said with a 
chuckle. And while it has toned down considerably, it still welcomes people 
such as the 60-year-old retiree who lives in a ramshackle three-room house, 
rides a motorcycle and wears leathers. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Bendel, a brash, 28-year-old lawyer who moved to the hillside three years 
ago, has helped lead the grass-roots fight against the project, but not without 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very eccentric, private place," Bendel said while driving 11-foot-wide 
stretches of dusty road in his Alfa Romeo. "Here I am, a Type A personality 
working with these Type B personality neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
When Bendel's neighbors wax eloquent about wanting to preserve the mellow 
ambience of their retreat, he has to remind them that such arguments carry 
little weight with government officials who will ultimately decide the 
community's fate. The issue over whether additional development along the 
narrow roads will create more fire danger is much more persuasive, he reminds 
them. 
</P>
<P>
He tells his neighbors that when they address the Board of Supervisors, they 
have to stick to practical rather than poetic descriptions of their magnificent 
canyon views. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't beautiful," he said of the area's dry hillsides. "It's fuel."

SMALL DAKOTA TOWN TURNS TO RETIREES FOR NEW BLOOD

ASHLEY, N.D. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Welcome to Ashley, North Dakota. Retirement haven. 
</P>
<P>
Retirement haven? 
</P>
<P>
"I never heard of it before," said Katie Sloan, a housing specialist with the 
American Assn. of Retired Persons in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Ashley, a farm town of about 1,200 near the South Dakota border, 
plan to change that. 
</P>
<P>
The town has no luxury condominiums or sandy beaches. But it has other appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get up at 3 a.m. and go for a walk, and no one cares. You can go for a 
walk to the park to see the sun rise," said Robert Dockter, whose father 
retired in Ashley. 
</P>
<P>
As you drive into Ashley along State Highway 11, there's the Lake Hoskins 
Recreation Area, then farm fields with gray grain elevators standing guard 
along the railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Main Street has the McIntosh County Bank, a hardware store, two cafes and City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Geiger, administrator of the Ashley Medical Center, and Bud Overbo, a bank 
vice president, came up with the plan to advertise Ashley in magazines read by 
retirees. About a year ago, they thought of attracting retired people as a way 
to increase the population and preserve existing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have doctors, but you can't attract doctors unless you have 
enough bodies," said Geiger, 61, who said he's interested in retiring in Ashley 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Retirees can sell their homes and buy a more moderate home in Ashley. They'd 
be able to use the interest to live on," said City Councilman Myron Schlepp, an 
insurance salesman. 
</P>
<P>
The retirement plan has no organized opposition, although some worry their 
community will age too much, council members said. 
</P>
<P>
People thinking of retiring in Ashley might want to know that: 
</P>
<P>
* It sits on prairie land, 80 miles from Aberdeen, S.D., the nearest big city. 
St. Paul, Minn., is 350 miles east. A freight train runs through town once a 
week during harvest time, once every two or three weeks otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
* The average three-bedroom home costs $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
* The city has a nine-hole golf course with sand greens, pinochle and gin 
tournaments, and frequent dances and church and civic group-sponsored social 
events. 
</P>
<P>
* Ashley notes its one full-time police officer, two police vehicles and two 
jail cells as evidence of a crime-free environment. 
</P>
<P>
* The city is the seat of McIntosh County, with a 1.6% unemployment rate. The 
medical center, with 26 hospital beds and 51 nursing home beds, is Ashley's 
largest employer. 
</P>
<P>
The new, not-for-profit Ashley Development Corp. was formed by the business 
people of Ashley, who hope to get grant money to promote Ashley in retirement 
magazines, Dockter said. But it may be an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while we do get a call from a community interested in 
enhancing its tax base," Sloan said in Washington. "But the reality is that 
most retirees don't move very far." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the biggest promotional obstacle may be the weather. In January, the 
National Weather Service says, the average high temperature is 18 degrees, with 
the average low at 4 below zero.

MOBILE HOME PARK OWNER FIGHTS 'LEWD, LASCIVIOUS' ACTIVITY BY RETIREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a mobile home park for retirees who frowns on unmarried couples 
living together has launched a legal battle he hopes will turn the clock back 
100 years. 
</P>
<P>
"This case could lead to the re-emergence of an extremely old and valuable 
principle -- the family," said Peter Hooper, lawyer for Romany Mobile Home 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
The case could affect all the fair-housing laws in Florida, said Gloria 
Williams, president of the Florida Assn. of Community Relations Professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Hooper represents William Watson, a quiet man in his early 60s who refers 
inquiries to his attorney: "I don't mean to be discourteous, but talk to my 
lawyer. I don't want to put my foot in my mouth." 
</P>
<P>
He's asking the courts if an 1868 state law against "lewd and lascivious" 
cohabitation is grounds to evict unmarried old couples who stay together in the 
same trailer. Hooper said "lewd and lascivious" is a general legal term that 
does not necessarily mean depravity and could apply to common sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
Watson also wants a Pinellas County judge to decide whether the state law 
renders unconstitutional local fair-housing laws forbidding discrimination 
based on marital status. 
</P>
<P>
Hooper, who is negotiating the case with the city and county, believes 
officials have no choice but to stand behind state law until it is removed or 
altered. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute, meanwhile, has caused a stir in the sleepy 96-site park where 
residents 55 and older pedal around the well-kept grounds on three-wheeled 
bicycles. More than half spend winters here, returning to cooler climates to 
escape the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it's immoral for people not married to live together," said Bernice 
Ulrey, a native of Indianapolis who has lived at the park since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter to me," said a balding white-haired man from Pontiac, Mich., 
who wouldn't give his name. Tenants are told the rules mean no overnight stays 
for unmarrieds, he said, adding: "What can you do at night that you can't do 
during the day?" 
</P>
<P>
Hooper calls the situation a Catch-22. On one hand state law bans cohabitation, 
but city and county law bans discrimination based on marital status. 
</P>
<P>
The problem isn't unique to this central Gulf Coast community, Hooper said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most states have the same conflicts in laws. They differ in degree and detail. 
It's a clash of new thoughts with old principles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some think the key to the case is in the interpretation of lewd and lascivious 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"That is really something you wouldn't know unless you looked through the 
windows," said James Yates, director of human relations for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Hooper disagrees. He thinks the terms could apply to an unmarried couple living 
together. 
</P>
<P>
The city ordinance contains an exemption allowing a landlord to refuse to rent 
to an unmarried couple, Yates said. This was added at the behest of ministers. 
</P>
<P>
But the county has no such exemption. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the county's stand in this day and time we don't consider cohabitation 
between two consenting adults to be lewd and lascivious behavior," said Robert 
Reece of the Pinellas County Office of Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Herman, a 65-year-old retiree who shared a mobile home with his wife 
until she died three years ago, is among the residents upset with the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"He is passing moral judgment on me," Herman said recently before heading back 
to New Jersey. Herman said he was told by Watson's son he must sell his home, 
lease it or marry his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"He's assuming that things are happening here," Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Hooper: "My client isn't shooting at any individual. He's sued the 
city and the county because they deserve it. They passed those ordinances that 
muddied the water." 
</P>
<P>
There are others who endorse Watson's effort. "We're behind the manager 100%," 
said Oscar Bray, a retiree from the Ann Arbor, Mich., area. 
</P>
<P>
Pinellas County Assistant Atty. Bill Falker said Watson assumes that people who 
are unrelated and living together are committing lewd and lascivious acts. "I 
don't know if we can make that assumption. It certainly doesn't seem so to me."

UNLEADED FUEL CREDITED FOR LEAD-LEVEL DROP IN SOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The switch to unleaded gasoline may have saved large tracts of trees in 
Northeastern forests. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists a decade ago feared that the buildup in soil of lead, which is 
toxic, would damage and possibly kill trees. But 15 years after the Clean Air 
Act forced auto makers to market cars that burn unleaded gasoline, scientists 
say lead concentrations in the forest floor already are falling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beautiful, the curve showing the decline of lead," said Thomas G. 
Siccama, a forest ecologist at the Yale University School of Forestry and 
Environmental Studies. "It has left the forest floor faster than the general 
community of ecologists thought." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Siccama and two other scientists, William H. Smith of Yale and Donald 
L. Mader of the University of Massachusetts, documented that from 1962 to 1978, 
lead levels in surface soils in Massachusetts had jumped from 682 milligrams 
per square meter to 1,160 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
Siccama, Smith and others, including Andrew J. Friedland of Dartmouth College 
and Arthur H. Johnson of the University of Pennsylvania, began looking more 
closely at the surface soil of forests, taking samples from Pennsylvania to New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, they and other researchers have begun to review the 
extensive data collected. 
</P>
<P>
At one test site, the Cathedral Pines forest in Cornwall, Penn., Julie 
Tritschler, a Yale graduate student, found lead has fallen since 1980 from 
1,275 milligrams per square meter to 940 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
At Hubbard Brook in West Thornton, N.H., lead levels in 1975 approached 1,100 
milligrams per square meter. By 1988, they had fallen to less than 800 
milligrams, Siccama said. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening, Siccama believes, is that over time the lead is being 
diluted in the underlying soil. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Kellett, Northeast regional director for the Wilderness Society, 
said the data is encouraging. But he cautioned that it is important to learn 
where the lead is going because it might be ending up in underground water 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Siccama and others say the decline in lead levels in soil is almost certainly 
due to the mandated use of unleaded gasoline in new cars beginning in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the whole point of the law," Siccama said. "It is a one-on-one 
connection. We know it has gone down in the rain, and we've followed it going 
down in the soil where we knew it was accumulating."

FARMERS PLOW ON AS LEADED GAS SUPPLY SHRINKS 
</P>

<P>
Farmers have added another problem to their list of worries -- where to find 
leaded gasoline for old but serviceable tractors. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that in a few years it will virtually disappear from the market," said 
Martha Casey, spokeswoman for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "I 
don't know how that market is going to turn out for farmers." 
</P>
<P>
Major refineries and most service stations no longer sell gasoline containing 
lead, which the EPA has been trying to phase out for the last decade. Major 
refineries quit producing leaded fuel because of the EPA's tougher pollution 
controls and declining demand. 
</P>
<P>
But leaded gasoline still is needed to run tractors, grain trucks, combines and 
other farm machinery bought in the 1970s or before. Using unleaded gasoline can 
damage the engines, an EPA study found. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of heavy farm work is done by diesel-powered tractors and 
combines. The situation remains serious, however, for small farms and bigger 
operations that use light tractors for some work, said Gary Huddleston, 
information director for the Kentucky Farm Bureau Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a 1985 questionnaire, the Federal Farm Bureau Federation estimates 
that there are an average of 10 engines per U.S. farm that use leaded fuel, 
said Jim Porterfield, associate director of the federation's environmental 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly half of the farmers said they want to continue using those engines for 
another 10 or 15 years at least," Porterfield said. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts us in a difficult position. It will impose some hardship," said Mike 
Crouse, who was told his supplier would no longer have leaded fuel for two 
tractors he uses to farm 166 acres near Dixon, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Making things more complicated, the EPA requires service stations that sell 
gasoline containing a phosphorous-based additive, but no lead, to label the 
fuel as "leaded." Farmers may not realize that they are not buying fuel with 
lead, which is needed to lubricate and protect valve seats in older truck and 
tractor engines. 
</P>
<P>
EPA studies of additives marketed to make unleaded gasoline safe for older 
engines have been inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Crouse said he cannot afford to replace the valve seats on his tractors, which 
would enable them to accept unleaded gasoline. The work would cost several 
hundred dollars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The situation varies from state to state. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana farmers should have less trouble than some finding leaded gasoline 
because the Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative Assn.'s refinery will provide more 
of the fuel as supplies dwindle elsewhere, said Ronald Stover, vice president 
of the co-op's petroleum division. 
</P>
<P>
"Our leaded gasoline sales continue to increase although the market is 
shrinking overall," he said. "We've gained about 7% per year in the farm market 
during the last couple of years, when most of the majors dropped out." 
</P>
<P>
But in some areas of Kentucky there is no leaded fuel available, Huddleston 
said.

I read with interest the article on Belize by Bill Belleville in your June 24 
Travel Section ("The Other Caribbean"). In March of this year, three couples, 
including ourselves, rented a home on North Ambergris Caye. 
</P>
<P>
For those who are considering spending some time on the Caye, I would like to 
point out two important facts. 
</P>
<P>
The Caye is divided by El Rio. South Ambergris, where the town of San Pedro is 
located, has the shops, more hotels, restaurants and dive shops. North 
Ambergris has fewer hotels, is more tranquil and water transportation to town 
is provided. 
</P>
<P>
The diving, snorkeling and fishing are indeed excellent. However, the swimming 
is poor due to turtle grass and soft sand. Beautiful-looking beaches, but poor 
for swimming. 
</P>
<P>
Condos and houses are available on both sides of El Rio. Reservations should be 
made as far ahead as possible for the best choices. Our three-bedroom, two-bath 
home, with private dock and daily maid service, plus transportation to San 
Pedro, was $200 U.S. per night. It was very well-equipped. Sundial Travel, 9430 
Warner Ave., Fountain Valley, (714) 962-1176, handled our arrangements. For 
information on houses and condos on the Caye, contact Mary Hawthorne (call 
011-501-2531). She and her partner, Carlos, manage several of the nicer rentals 
on the Caye, and were a great source of information and one of the prime 
reasons our trip was so rewarding.

COMMENTS ON CUBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Horn's cover story on tourism in Cuba ("The Other Caribbean," June 24) was 
remarkably fair and free of cold-war mentality. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba's pristine beaches and paucity of Coca-Cola signs, and the like, sound 
inviting. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, though Cuba welcomes tourists from the United States, our government 
prohibits ordinary tourists from visiting there. I thought it was Communist 
countries that restricted the travel of their citizens to capitalist countries 
to prevent them from learning what capitalism is really like. It seems we need 
our own glasnost here in the U.S.A.

As a former resident of Boston for 38 years, I enjoyed Robert Burns' articles 
on the city in your July 1 issue ("Boston Pops!"). But I'd like to point out 
that the principal photo you used was incorrectly captioned. The building shown 
in the photo was not Faneuil Hall but Quincy Market, which is just east of the 
hall and very close to it.

In James T. Yenckel's June 24 story, "Touring the European Countryside by Foot 
Offers Memorable Images," the accompanying photo of Chambord Chateau contains 
an interesting aspect. The rooftops of Chambord are a replica of Paris of the 
period when Chambord was built. Also, the unique double spiral staircase was 
reputedly designed by Leonardo da Vinci during his exile in France.

WHITTIER COMES BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Referring to Peter Greenberg's June 17 article on tourism in the Prince William 
Sound ("Visitors Begin to Return to Alaska After Spill"), Whittier is an 
isolated community. Indeed it is true to its claim to be "unique even to 
Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
And yes, several buildings in Whittier are in shabby disrepair or simply 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
However, your article gave complete disregard to some outstanding efforts by 
individuals in Whittier to make the town an attractive and pleasant day-trip 
for tourists. The quayside is lined with several quaint shops -- gift shop and 
visitors center, not to mention a small fish-and-chips shop that produces the 
best seafood dinners in the Sound. The Kayak rental agency accommodates the 
most adventurous groups. There are also some very beautiful and challenging 
hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
The town does not pretend to be sophisticated, but your comments on Whittier 
gave scant regard for the positive claims of this rather unusual little town 
and its enterprising residents.

WHITTIER COMES BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article printed June 17 entitled "Visitors begin to Return to Alaska After 
Spill" was saddening to read. Many tourists who have not ever been to Whittier, 
Alaska, will only have your opinion to rely on. 
</P>
<P>
How sad! 
</P>
<P>
My perception of Whittier is a quiet city full of majestic wonders not created 
by man but by God. Our roads are not overcrowded with bumper-to-bumper traffic 
nor do our eyes sting from smog-filled skies. We do not have to deal with drug- 
and gang-related wars in our town. We have the freedom to walk the streets day 
or night without looking over our shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
How can you say the train never leaves on time? Also, the state ferry doesn't 
leave whenever it is ready to leave. Are your freeways so sophisticated you 
always leave on time and arrive at your destination on time?

MOVIE SCRIPT -- IT MAY HAVE THE LONGEST LIST OF CREDITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For businessman Tom Byron, it loomed as the springboard that could one day take 
him from manufacturing pneumatic car seats in Sun Valley to molding screenplays 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
For screenwriter Sara Lou O'Connor, it was a chance to share her script with 
about 100 other writers as they took turns tapping out movie scenes on a 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
And for high school senior Eboney Bradley, the Great American Script-athon was 
an opportunity to receive financial help for some filmmaking classes as well as 
to experience her first taste of deadline writing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so nervous at first, I went to the bathroom three times before I could 
write all my scenes," Bradley said. "Now, I'm just anxious to see how they 
read. I just want to know what's going to happen with the script." 
</P>
<P>
Spoken like a true screenwriter. And on Saturday, it seemed everybody was a 
writer for this 48-hour type-till-you-drop-while-everyone-shops screenwriting 
session at the Century City Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
In a marathon effort to produce a salable movie script in two days, more than 
100 writers from the nonprofit Independent Writers of Southern California 
organization and a dozen passers-by willing to plunk down $10 for 10 minutes at 
the computer churned out a screenplay called "Hot Property." 
</P>
<P>
Just how hot it will be remains to be seen. But for some collaborators like the 
50-year-old Byron, just participating on a movie script and contributing two 
scenes and two sentences of dialogue was enough to echo the Hollywood dream. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows?" Byron said smiling. "Someone might look at this and use it as a 
springboard for me." 
</P>
<P>
Other collaborators shared that sentiment, if not for themselves then at least 
for their collective screenplay: a "light romantic comedy" about an eccentric 
elderly man who wants to bestow his house -- the last affordable house in Los 
Angeles -- on a deserving young couple. 
</P>
<P>
The screenplay has a villain -- a sinister land developer named Marvin 
Montebank -- and a heroine named Allison Jessup who was thrown out of the 
Police Academy for refusing to learn how to drive and is now facing eviction 
from her home. 
</P>
<P>
Will there be a happy ending? 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Crooks, president of IWOSC, said she hopes so -- not only at the end of 
the 200 pages that are expected to be finished by this morning's 6 a.m. 
deadline but also after the screenplay is polished and edited by a committee of 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can auction it to a movie studio or (independent) filmmaker," said 
Crooks, adding that a special auction will be held in mid-September to 
entertain bids. "We hope to create the longest line of screenwriting credits in 
history." 
</P>
<P>
If the screenplay sells, Crooks said the proceeds will go to IWOSC, which was 
founded in 1982 as a nonprofit association and includes free-lance 
scriptwriters, journalists, authors, publicists and poets among its 450 
members. And she remains optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is possible in Hollywood," said Crooks. 
</P>
<P>
One studio executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was not so sure. "I 
think it's a creative idea, but we'll have to see just how good a script it is 
and how it sells," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Selling the screenplay was only one of Saturday's goals, however. Money raised 
during the marathon -- through corporate pledges and from individuals who paid 
to write a scene -- will go to pay for inner-city high school students to 
attend a special film workshop at the USC School of Cinema-Television, Crooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another goal was to entertain. And as the writers pounded away at their 
computers, actors -- including a canine actor -- performed finished portions of 
the script on a nearby stage, all to the delight of an audience of shoppers and 
tourists.

PLAYING PIANO IS HELPING HOMELESS MAN GET BACK ON HIS FEET

<TEXT>
<P>
At night, Francois returns to the streets, looking for an alley, a park or an 
accommodating bench, the familiar haunts of thousands of the city's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But during the day, he can be found lost in a melody as he plays "Stardust" and 
other standards for an admiring lunchtime crowd at an upscale Westwood cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons are stunned when they hear his story. A Skid Row fixture for the last 
five years, Francois (his first name is Michael, but he says he never uses it) 
says most people didn't even want to look at him, let alone give him a chance 
to play. That was the case when the 64-year-old musician showed up at Bon 
Appetit in Westwood two months ago, looking very much like a street person, 
offering to play the piano for food. 
</P>
<P>
He got his chance. After persuading David Gimpel, manager of the cafe, that 
after living the blues he could also play them, Francois cut his hair, trimmed 
his beard and found some clean clothes. And then he began returning to the club 
every day at lunchtime to practice the songs he knew so well before despair and 
drugs led him to a life in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody told me about this place and so I walked here from downtown one day," 
Francois said of the 14-mile trek. "I remember going to a catering truck near 
here to ask them for some milk, and some construction worker says, 'Why don't 
you go get a job?' I told him I was on my way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult adjusting (to the mainstream) again. Right now I'm at a point 
where I don't know exactly where to go. But I'm just trying to straighten my 
life out. I'm doing something and I feel good about it." 
</P>
<P>
His deft touch on the piano doesn't reveal glimpses of the hard life Francois 
has endured. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles native said he spent time in jail on drug and vagrancy charges 
earlier this year. He tried to pull himself out of the tailspin and played for 
a time at a Venice jazz club, but ended back on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Francois spent most of his adult life working in one job or another, 
spending most of his time as a hairdresser. Music served more as a hobby than a 
profession. He took lessons to learn the saxophone but taught himself how to 
play piano. 
</P>
<P>
Francois said his downward spiral started in 1985 when five family members, 
including his wife, sister and grandmother, died in less than a year. That led 
him to drugs, he said, and eventually to Skid Row, far from the studios and 
jazz clubs where he once played and aspired to greatness. (He said he worked as 
an uncredited sideman with soul groups such as the Impressions and the 
Temptations.) 
</P>
<P>
No one has been more startled at Francois' turnaround than Gimpel, who helps to 
manage his father's Broxton Avenue cafe and music publishing business. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not in good shape when he came in here but he's cleaned himself up and 
now we can't get rid of him," Gimpel said. "He comes in the morning to 
practice, to learn some new songs, and he's playing pretty well now. He's 
adopted us and we've adopted him. And he's really trying hard to do something 
with his life." 
</P>
<P>
Others, like Beverly Hills resident Ann Banks, have been so touched by his 
story that they've felt compelled to offer him help. Banks has given him 
clothing and is telling anyone who will listen about "this incredible musician" 
who is trying to right himself through his touch on the ivories. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the cafe one day with my back to the wall, and all of a sudden I hear 
the most beautiful music," she said. "He has the most incredible touch on the 
piano. And when I heard his story, I just couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Francois is still playing for food and tips, but the future looks 
promising. A record management company official has offered to try and find him 
auditions and also a room for him to live. And what Los Angeles story would be 
complete without a movie deal? Francois said he has been approached by a film 
producer who said he was interested in doing a TV movie on the story of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
But, Francois insists, the story is not finished yet. He said he is determined 
to try and make a living as a musician. But at the top of his list is his goal 
to rise above the streets and assume a more normal life. 
</P>
<P>
"God was really good to me," he said. "When I started playing again, the music 
just came back to me. It's been easier relearning the songs than it has been 
adjusting to the other parts of my life. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are just starting to happen now, and I'm happy that I've reached this 
point. Two months ago, I was living on the streets downtown, and now I'm living 
on the streets in Westwood. That's better, right?"

RIVER OF GUNS IN L.A. NEVER STOPS FLOWING; 
</P>
<P>
WEAPONS: ABOUT 25,000 FIREARMS A YEAR ARE DESTROYED. THE INVENTORY HAS GOTTEN 
MORE POWERFUL, INCLUDING AN ANTITANK ROCKET LAUNCHER.

<P>
A river of blued steel and chrome flows from dozens of police evidence rooms 
throughout Los Angeles County to a scrap metal shredder in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two decades, Clean Steel Inc. has taken 450,000 guns out of 
circulation -- enough weapons each year to arm every man, woman and child in a 
city the size of South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The river never stops. This month, about 25,000 firearms -- from derringers to 
antiaircraft guns -- were crunched, loaded on barges, and towed to Japan to 
make rebars for homes and skyscrapers. It was the haul of a single year. Next 
year, the shelves of these evidence rooms will brim anew with at least 25,000 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department seize these guns as evidence in crimes ranging from gas station 
stickups to long-planned murders. Many of the weapons were stolen from gun 
collectors or homeowners who bought them for protection, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"The more guns there are out there, the more guns there are to be stolen and 
used in crimes," said Bill Moran, commanding officer for the LAPD's 
30,000-square-foot central property room. 
</P>
<P>
"Take this one, for instance," Moran said, holding up a flat-black Spas 
12-gauge shotgun with a pistol grip and collapsible stock. "You don't shoot 
quail with one of these." 
</P>
<P>
He opened drawers stuffed with guns and ammunition, including a .45-caliber 
Mac-10 equipped with a silencer, an antitank rocket launcher and Teflon-coated 
bullets capable of penetrating concrete and cars. A Thompson submachine gun in 
a violin case, an arresting echo of Prohibition days, rested on a nearby shelf. 
</P>
<P>
"That thing could sure ruin your day," Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
All the guns seized in crimes each year are tagged, trotted out for trials, and 
returned to endless aisles of shelves. Unless the rightful owners claim them, 
they will go to the scrap yard next July. 
</P>
<P>
Only the composition of the river of steel changes from year to year, police 
say. Sampling it shows a dark side of Southern California and, perhaps, the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"There's tons of guns out there," said Sheriff's Deputy Edward Nordskog. "Why? 
Because everybody is afraid. Why? Because they read the papers and watch 
television and believe they need protection." 
</P>
<P>
Guns have evolved over the last 20 years. While police said that the bulk of 
confiscated weapons are still handguns -- .22-caliber pistols and snub-nosed 
"Saturday night specials" -- the evidence rooms are becoming crowded with more 
imposing weapons, an arsenal that could outfit a modern guerrilla army. There 
are automatic 12-gauge "street sweepers," machine pistols and assault rifles 
capable of firing bursts of armor-piercing bullets in seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Those who process this materiel find the work frightening. 
</P>
<P>
"The guns scare me to death, to tell you the truth," said Officer Lillian 
Woodfin, who has logged more than 15,000 guns in her three years in the Police 
Department's heavily guarded central property room. "It's sad that these 
weapons are destroying us." 
</P>
<P>
About 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, Sheriff's Deputy Bob Schneider was 
helping to catalogue and stack the 10 guns a day that come through the Lynwood 
Sheriff's Station -- the busiest district in the county with 20 gang-related 
murders reported so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, who was a reserve officer in Merced before joining the Sheriff's 
Department in February, waved a hand over box loads of pistols and gun racks 
stacked with assault rifles and sawed-off shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
"In Merced, you could count the number of guns on one hand," he said. "When I 
came here I asked, 'Where did all these guns come from?' 
</P>
<P>
"I was told, 'From drive-bys, assaults, premeditated murders and rapes' -- 
stuff I only saw in the movies." 
</P>
<P>
Around the corner from the Lynwood Station, a 17-year-old gang member talked 
knowledgeably about the gun business. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, you can expect to get shot back in a drive-by -- so you better have 
a good gun," he said, speaking only on the condition that his name not be used. 
"You can let go a lot of shots, reload and do it again. It's safer." 
</P>
<P>
Peering up and down Imperial Avenue for the ride that would take him to a job 
interview at a hamburger joint, he went on: 
</P>
<P>
"But you take a big risk when you buy a gun on the street, because they might 
have put murders in it. Or you could shoot someone and sell it to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes on and on." 
</P>
<P>
Just like the river.

DROUGHT SCENARIOS RUN FROM BENIGN TO DOOMSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For four years, Southern California's water officials have yearned for rain and 
a reassuring blanket of winter snow melting high in the Sierra Nevada. For four 
years, nature has spurned them. 
</P>
<P>
Midway into the fourth year of drought, some water agency officials, government 
planners, politicians and scientists are wondering what will happen if the rain 
and snow repeatedly fail to fall. What if the drought persists, lasting not 
only into a fifth year, but for as long as seven or even eight years, equaling 
the longest known sustained dry periods on record? 
</P>
<P>
Water experts and political observers have advanced a welter of scenarios, from 
the benign to the apocalyptic. Many of their visions of a parched future share 
some common threads -- the inevitability of water rationing, the threat of 
conflict over water rights, and the growing likelihood that voters might be 
forced to choose between developing new major sources of water or curbing 
Southern California's relentless growth. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond those shared elements, the scenarios diverge. Some water experts suggest 
that successive years of rationing would wear at the nerves of city residents, 
hitting hardest at the poor, immigrants and those who already have been 
conserving water. Chronic shortages could heighten tensions between urban and 
agricultural water users, some observers warn; others suggest that cities 
sharing common water sources might quarrel over shrinking allotments. Others 
see court battles looming between water agencies and environmental interests. 
</P>
<P>
Should some of the worst-case scenarios be realized, Southern California's 
landscape would be dramatically altered. The darkest visions encompass the 
withering of lawns, the loss of sections of farmland, hoarding of water by 
consumers, and economic calamities in industries dependent on a strong and 
steady flow of water. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most optimistic water agency officials, who believe that their 
contingency plans for long-term drought will work, acknowledge that the plans 
have never been truly tested. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have three more years as dry as we've had in 1990, clearly, we're 
approaching the unknown," said Duane Georgeson, assistant general manager for 
the Metropolitan Water District, the agency that provides water to more than 
240 municipalities in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego 
and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
The known, to most water experts, has been a random pattern of wet and dry 
spells that characterizes California's weather in the 20th Century -- a period 
in which droughts have lasted no longer than two or three years in succession. 
</P>
<P>
Only once this century, from 1929 through about 1935, has a sustained drought 
lasted beyond the usual two- to three-year span. The seven-year dry spell 
devastated between 20,000 and 30,000 acres of farmland in the San Joaquin 
Valley and helped spark a massive federal dam-building program. 
</P>
<P>
California's water agencies use the 1930s shortage as a marker for their 
contingency plans and water capacity. The drought is the basis for the 
California State Water Project's "rule curve," a planning factor used to ensure 
that the system's reservoirs and storage facilities can provide, with 
conservation, supplies of at least six years' worth of water. 
</P>
<P>
A series of more recent scientific studies of tree ring samples from ancient 
groves scattered around the state have hinted that at least one other historic 
dry spell lasted as long as the 1930s drought. Dr. David Meko, a scientist with 
the University of Arizona Tree-Ring Research Laboratory, said that tree core 
samples taken in 1970 show a similar period of drought in the mid-1840s -- 
"more severe than any in the current century." Similar studies indicate that 
most of the western United States endured a dry period that may have lasted up 
to two decades near the end of the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Some hydrologists dispute the tree ring data, saying that few samples were 
taken from trees in Northern California or in the Sierra Nevada -- the 
snow-covered mountains that this region relies on each year for 75% of its 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"Without enough tree rings from those areas, I would have reservations about 
how good a reconstruction it is," said Maurice Roos, the state water 
department's chief hydrologist. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists admit that there is no hard evidence weighing against the 
possibility of a drought enduring at least seven or eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unlikely you would get consecutive very dry conditions below normal in 
more than six or seven years running," Meko said. "Of course, if you flip coins 
long enough, there's always the chance of getting more than a few heads in a 
row." 
</P>
<P>
Many water experts predict that the drought would begin playing havoc with 
Southern California lifestyles by its fifth year. Little precipitation this 
winter, most water experts believe, would make regionwide water rationing 
mandatory by the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Los Angeles City Council voted down mandatory rationing in favor 
of a voluntary conservation program. But the rationing plan, backed by Mayor 
Tom Bradley, is already a model for similar laws on the books in many of the 
region's cities. 
</P>
<P>
Another year of drought would make the rationing law inevitable, Bradley 
Administration and water agency officials said. The plan would tie customers' 
water consumption to the amount they used in 1986, the last pre-drought year. 
It would require 10% cutbacks at first, but increase to 25% as the drought 
worsens. Those who used more than their allotments would be slapped with 
increasing fees and eventually see their water supply reduced by "flow 
restrictors." 
</P>
<P>
"The city responded well to the last drought and they responded well to the 
energy crisis," said John Stodder, a Bradley aide. "Why wouldn't they in 
another water crisis?" 
</P>
<P>
In an extended drought, the city's highly transient immigrant population might 
not be able to adapt to rationing guidelines set in the base year by earlier 
tenants, some officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the potential problem, Stodder said, Los Angeles created a 
"generous" appeals system, and devised a separate formula for rental units, 
making landlords and tenants share equally the fines for repeated violations. 
</P>
<P>
Ignacio Perez, a Salvadoran spokesman for the Central American Refugee 
Committee, warned that immigrants, suspicious of government agencies, would be 
reluctant to appeal. Penalizing landlords for the violations of a few renters, 
Perez said, might lead apartment owners to "count the number of people in each 
unit and kick them out." 
</P>
<P>
Accustomed to severe rationing programs in their homelands that often cut water 
supplies for days at a time, some immigrants might crowd into urban markets to 
hoard bottled water, assuming that supplies will again be scarce. "When you are 
afraid, you don't wait for explanations," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
There are also worries about industrial water users. A study of the 1976-77 
drought by the UCLA Business Forecasting Project found no lingering damage from 
rationing. William S. Wade, a consultant for the MWD, predicts that an extended 
statewide water shortage that cuts supplies by 24% could cost Los Angeles 
industry $25 billion and 350,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Even if rationing plans work as well as their architects forecast, most 
regional water agency officials admit that they might still have to seek other 
steady supplies. Officials at MWD and the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power say that they would most likely seek help from California's agricultural 
water agencies. Farms use more than 87% of California's water in wet years, but 
this year, rural water companies have had their state-managed supplies slashed 
by up to 50% and federal allotments reduced by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
One way for rural users to help cities would be to enter into more "water 
transfer" agreements, a mainstay of water agency policy in recent wet years. 
Rural agencies would be encouraged to sell their water to parched cities in 
return for similar favors in the future. Another option would be for farmers to 
be paid by urban water agencies to let their land lie fallow, saving water for 
urban areas, said James Wickser, DWP assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
A complicated system governs the flow of water into California, directing water 
through 1,200 dams -- more than in any other state -- and storing it in more 
than 140 federal, state and local reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
Water is captured from four major sources. The massive State Water Project 
releases water through the Sacramento River into the Sacramento Delta, then 
funnels it to the California Aqueduct. The federal Central Valley Project 
shunts melted snow from several Sierra rivers and lakes to San Joaquin Valley 
farms. The Colorado River delivers water to Los Angeles and much of the 
southern part of the state. The Los Angeles Aqueduct siphons water from the 
Owens Valley and a lesser portion from Mono Lake into the city's reservoir 
system. 
</P>
<P>
When some of those major sources lose water during an extended drought, water 
agencies try to tap into whatever sources remain abundant. But as each drought 
year passes, Southern California has seen its rainfall slacken, its federal 
Colorado River allotment whittled away by other states, its Sierra snow sources 
evaporating, and its Owens Valley and Mono Lake sources restricted by angry 
residents and court orders. 
</P>
<P>
Though recent water transfer pacts between the MWD and rural water agencies 
were reached without rancor, some officials worry that attitudes might stiffen 
as water becomes more scarce. Southern California water agencies have been 
vilified by farmers for decades as the bureaucratic symbols of Los Angeles' 
grab for water rights. After almost a century of bad blood, there is little 
evidence that farmers' suspicions have completely eased. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California water agencies might be forced to lobby state and federal 
water-rights authorities to prod farmers into giving up more water. Assemblyman 
Jim Costa (D-Fresno), well-versed in rural water worries, believes that any 
friction would take the form of intense lobbying and court fights. 
</P>
<P>
Land-fallowing policies might be especially thorny, he said, because too many 
idle farms could set off regional economic downturns -- hurting farm suppliers 
and neighboring merchants. 
</P>
<P>
"It could get very cannibalistic for awhile," Costa said. 
</P>
<P>
Cities might be pitted against neighboring communities as supplies dry up. 
Within the MWD's service area, Los Angeles has yet to take its full yearly 26% 
allotment of water, allowing San Diego and Orange counties to withdraw more 
than their annual rations. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe our allotment is sacrosanct," says a top DWP official. But in an 
extended drought, changes might be sought. Orange County and San Diego water 
officials have long claimed -- at least, academically -- that because they have 
grown to rely on these extra allotments, their supplies should not be cut 
during a drought. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California's water agency officials might seek to temporarily weaken 
environmental protections that require massive amounts of fresh water. In the 
Sacramento Delta, barriers could cut the flow of fresh water to the sea, said 
the MWD's Georgeson. Fish might suffer in the estuary, but a similar move was 
allowed by courts during the 1976-1977 drought. 
</P>
<P>
Another option, DWP officials said, might be to ask courts to allow the agency 
to drain more water from Mono Lake, a move currently prohibited. "You might 
have court fights, but that's what balancing the public trust is all about," 
said assistant general manager Wickser -- a rationale that might be opposed by 
the agency's new majority of environmentally conscious commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Some water experts suggest that tinkering with the environment could backfire 
at a time when wildlife groups are flexing new-found political muscle. If the 
"Big Green" ballot initiative passes this fall, Costa said, "fish and wildlife 
would get more water priority than cities or agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
Even if those environmental interests are left untouched, the anti-growth 
crusade could become a major issue. Weary of rationing, the region's voters 
might become receptive to such sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"We've damaged the air, we've built on every square foot of land and our waters 
are polluted," said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). "Either we ignore the 
signs or step back. The concept of unlimited growth is outdated when water 
becomes this much of a constraint." 
</P>
<P>
Political observers say that water agencies and pro-development forces would 
have no choice but to join the debate, supporting new water projects like the 
Peripheral Canal, pushed in 1980 by Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., but 
defeated by voters. 
</P>
<P>
This year, water experts say, only a real rain could wash away all the 
scenarios and the troubles they pose. Otherwise, they will have to wait until 
January, when teams of hydrologists again trek to the Sierra to measure the 
snowpack and make their predictions for the coming year.

LABOR UNREST SPREADING TO SOVIET FARMS

<P>
Labor unrest that has paralyzed major segments of Soviet industry in recent 
months is spreading to the country's farms at the height of the summer harvest, 
threatening to worsen already severe food shortages. 
</P>
<P>
By Saturday, farmers in more than a dozen major agricultural regions had formed 
strike committees to push their demands, which focus on more governmental 
support for state and collective farms, increased supplies of consumer goods 
and greater overall concern for the quality of life in the country's rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Unless they receive more fuel, machinery and spare parts immediately and can 
hire seasonal labor at reasonable prices, they are threatening to withhold 
their produce, let it rot in the fields or even plow it back into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the city people help in the vegetable fields, they will not get a 
single ounce of food," the regional council in Michurin, a farming area 
southeast of Moscow, warned its urban customers. 
</P>
<P>
Already characterized by the Communist Party newspaper Pravda as a possible 
"peasants' revolt," the movement now ranges from Kostroma northeast of Moscow 
to Perm on the western slopes of the Ural Mountains to Karaganda in Kazakhstan, 
in Soviet Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Although they have the potential for a good or even bumper harvest this year, 
Soviet farmers are complaining that the accelerating collapse of the country's 
economy has left them unable to gather the crops. 
</P>
<P>
They do not have enough fuel for their harvesting equipment or enough spare 
parts to keep machines operating. There are not enough trucks to take the 
produce from the fields into town and not enough gasoline for the trucks they 
do have. And fewer city residents are coming to help with the harvest this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is so critical that Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of Russia, 
the largest Soviet republic, warned last week of a potential catastrophe unless 
the farmers are given "vigorous assistance" with the harvest by the cities. 
</P>
<P>
The farmers also complain, in a strong echo of the grievances of the country's 
coal miners, oil-field workers and others who have struck in recent months, 
that the lack of consumer goods and rising inflation has made the money they 
receive for their produce almost worthless and daily life increasingly 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
They are seeking, more fundamentally, to restore the balance between 
agriculture and industry and between the rural and urban economies that was 
destroyed by dictator Josef Stalin when he first collectivized agriculture and 
then used the funds it generated to finance, in large part, the country's 
industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do not manage to find a way to merge the interests of town and country, 
we (urbanites) may find ourselves on an even more meager ration," Pravda 
warned. "And this at a time when the farmers have grown an excellent harvest. 
Isn't this a crime?" 
</P>
<P>
The newly formed Soviet Agrarian Union last week called for far-reaching 
changes to redress the economic imbalance, now recognized as the key to solving 
the country's perpetual food shortage, and to improve the quality of life in 
rural areas, which are dying from cultural as well as economic poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"How much longer do you think we should put up with this?" Leonid Shamkov, head 
of a collective farm in Kostroma, said as he complained to Pravda of a system 
that has methodically transferred the wealth of the countryside to the 
government and industry. "We can't stand it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"You in Moscow apparently do not realize what the real state of affairs is in 
our agriculture -- the village has been virtually forced to its knees." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Persiyantseva, former chairwoman of a collective farm and a leader in the 
"peasants' revolt," said farmers should harvest as much as they can but be 
selective in their deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be immoral for farmers to strike while the harvest spoils," she said. 
"So, we are not going to strike in the farm fields. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are the owners of the farm produce we turn out. This is a powerful 
lever, and in extreme circumstances we will use it." 
</P>
<P>
In Perm, agricultural leaders declared that any city or town that refuses to 
send workers and vehicles to help with the harvest will receive no food. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a bottle of milk to the enterprises!" the chairman of one regional 
agricultural committee in the Perm area said. "Only this will show the power of 
the peasantry." 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Perm strike committee said city residents will begin to 
understand the plight of farmers only when "water, just water, was served at 
(factory) canteens for the first, second and third courses." 
</P>
<P>
Shamkov said that in past years, farms got help in harvesting from factory 
workers in nearby towns, but "now that factories operate on the 
pay-your-own-way principle, the prices they demand for seasonal farm work are 
enough to make you scream." 
</P>
<P>
Workers at a railway depot at Bui, north of Kostroma, demanded a 75% premium 
for farm work plus overtime plus pay for days off. "Such aid can only ruin us," 
Shamkov said. 
</P>
<P>
The threats worked in Perm, the trade union newspaper Trud reported on 
Saturday. Many more factory workers were sent to help in the fields, and 900 
trucks were dispatched to bring the harvest to the processing centers. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are now discussing new "treaties" that will ensure the region's 
farms the assistance they need in return for guaranteed deliveries of food.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sandy Reed climbed out of the small airplane and squinted into the cloudless 
tropical sky. Paint was peeling off the deserted terminal. The Rio Negro, the 
largest tributary of the mighty Amazon, lay hidden behind a screen of trees. 
Only a rutted road sliced through the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere down that road lay the end of a quest -- the end, if not the 
solution, to a mystery that had awakened Reed on countless nights, propelled 
her across three continents and drained her meager savings: the unknown, 
perhaps unknowable, fate of her brother, John Reed, who in 1980 disappeared 
somewhere beyond this silent clearing. 
</P>
<P>
There had been rumors about him, purported sightings of a tall white man among 
the Indians, unconfirmable tales of a partial skeleton lying in a hammock 
beside the river, even allegations of murder. In the worst of her dreams, his 
frightened voice had told her, "It's not like I thought it would be here." 
</P>
<P>
In the Amazon Basin, myths are as thick as vines, and its 2.5 million square 
miles remain today as impervious to the order and logic of civilization as in 
the year 1500, when Spanish explorer Vincente Yanez Pinzon recorded first 
seeing the river. 
</P>
<P>
Armies and adventurers have sought their fortunes and their futures here. But 
the often impenetrable Amazon does not surrender treasures or truths readily. 
For five centuries, many who sought them have left empty-handed -- or not at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
John Reed, who hungered for some undefined higher knowledge and once wrote a 
book about UFO sightings, had come to believe in one of the countless stories 
of lost cities inhabited by ancient tribes, their location known only to a 
solitary guide. In this case, the guide was a shadowy figure called Tatunca 
Nara, the progenitor of this particular tale. 
</P>
<P>
Reed was not the only one who thought there was a lost civilization to be 
found. Herbert Wanner, a 24-year-old Swiss who came to the jungle in 1984, was 
a believer, too. So was Christine Heuser, a middle-aged Swedish yoga instructor 
whose fascination with Indians led her to Tatunca Nara in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
These three shared something else: One by one, they disappeared -- murdered, 
some authorities believe -- while in the company of Tatunca Nara. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after retreating once in fear of her own life, Sandy Reed had come back to 
the Amazon -- with a German filmmaker and a Times reporter along -- to demand 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
The village of Barcelos, with its 3,000 residents, 10 cars and one telephone, 
lay before her, dirty and unwelcoming, on the edge of the Rio Negro. Television 
sets blared incongruously through open windows as she walked -- in jeans, 
Reebok sneakers and a bush jacket -- past dilapidated shacks and silent stares. 
</P>
<P>
She stopped to ask directions from an elderly woman hanging wash on a wooden 
fence. She had only to speak the name of the man she sought. Everyone in 
Barcelos knew the legendary Tatunca Nara. 
</P>
<P>
Tatunca Nara claimed to be the chief of a tribe that for 3,000 years supposedly 
had ruled Akakor, the capital of a lost civilization where descendants of gods 
were supposed to have lived in stone pyramids and subterranean shelters. He was 
born, he said, in the jungle near the border with Peru, the son of a German 
nurse who had been captured by Indians and taken by their chief to be his wife. 
</P>
<P>
His tale became the basis for a book, "The Chronicle of Akakor," written in 
1976 by Karl Brugger, a German journalist based in Rio de Janeiro. The book 
described Akakor, its people and its history in alluring detail. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Tatunca parlayed his legend into a business, leading tourists 
into the Amazon. He took them by boat along endless miles of postcard-perfect 
rivers and streams. He even served as guide for an elaborate expedition mounted 
by Jacques Cousteau, the famous French explorer-scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Few who went into the wilds with Tatunca believed the story of Akakor; it 
merely added another layer of exotica to the adventure of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
For some, however, Tatunca's tale touched deeper chords. John Reed had gone so 
far as to have what Brugger's book described as the symbol of Akakor, a sun 
rising out of water, tattooed over his heart. 
</P>
<P>
When he vanished into the malarial jungle in 1980, John Reed, tall and blond, 
had left behind four hope-filled letters, his dog tags and his ticket back to 
the States. The last person known to have seen the 28-year-old man was his 
guide, Tatunca. 
</P>
<P>
West German police say they suspect that Tatunca murdered Reed, Wanner and 
Heuser, although no charges have been filed and no bodies have been found. 
</P>
<P>
The jungle has relinquished little evidence in this strange case. A jaw 
discovered by Swiss tourists in 1986 was identified through dental records as 
that of Wanner. About Reed, there have been only rumors; about Heuser, not even 
that. 
</P>
<P>
The German police also suspect that Tatunca played a role in the death of Karl 
Brugger in 1984. Brugger was shot in the heart on a Rio street by a gunman who 
had demanded his money. A companion said Brugger was reaching for his wallet 
when the man shot him and ran off without taking anything. Rio police declared 
robbery the motive. 
</P>
<P>
Stories circulate in the Amazon, however, that the robbery was a ruse, and that 
Brugger's death was the result of an argument with Tatunca over royalties from 
"The Chronicle of Akakor." 
</P>
<P>
The suspicions do not stop there. Brazil's federal police acknowledge that they 
are investigating the separate disappearances of an Austrian man and a woman 
from New Zealand, both of whom were last seen with Tatunca. 
</P>
<P>
Tatunca denied involvement in the killings in statements to Brazilian 
authorities and a U.S. consular agent. As he told it, Reed and Wanner each ran 
away and hid in the jungle when he asked them to return with him to Barcelos. 
He said he put Heuser on a boat to Manaus, a city down the river, and never saw 
her again, just as he did with the Austrian and the woman from New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
But like the jungle butterflies whose brilliant patterns mimic bad-tasting 
varieties to throw off predators, Tatunca Nara has seemingly cloaked himself in 
deception and disguise. 
</P>
<P>
According to West German authorities, Tatunca is really Guenther Hauck, a West 
German citizen born on Oct. 5, 1941, in Bavaria. The police have his birth 
certificate and other personal records. A police expert studied photographs of 
Hauck from his teens to early 20s, and of the man who calls himself Tatunca. 
The expert declared that they are the same person. 
</P>
<P>
Police records show that Hauck was a sailor on a West German freighter in 1966 
when he jumped ship in Venezuela. Arrested, he claimed to be an Indian. A 
psychiatrist diagnosed him as schizophrenic, and Hauck was returned to West 
Germany, where he was jailed for three months for failing to support his wife 
and two sons. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, Hauck sailed to Brazil and again jumped ship, the West 
German police say. This time he disappeared, and Tatunca Nara emerged. He 
married a Brazilian and they have two teen-age children. Last year, Hauck's 
ex-wife traveled to Barcelos from West Germany and identified Tatunca as her 
former husband. 
</P>
<P>
"His whole story is crazy," insists Kurt Hartert, the detective heading the 
West German investigation. "This man we are talking about, who is suspected of 
having killed three people, is Guenther Hauck. There is no doubt about this." 
</P>
<P>
Hartert claims jurisdiction because Hauck is still a West German citizen, and 
West German law extends to its citizens anywhere in the world. But Brazilian 
authorities have refused to allow the West German investigators into the 
country, contending that Brazil is conducting its own inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has sent diplomatic notes to the Brazilians asking 
that the German investigators be allowed into the country. Edwin L. Beffel, the 
U.S. consul general in Brazil, recently went to the Foreign Ministry in 
Brasilia to reiterate the request. So far, the Brazilians have continued to 
resist. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic niceties, however, have been no barrier to Sandy Reed's struggle to 
discover what happened to her brother. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Sandy Reed and her mother, Virginia, clung to the improbable belief 
that John was living with the Indians in the Amazon. Hadn't his last letter 
said he was only a day or two from Akakor? Hadn't the U.S. consular agent in 
Manaus sent them assurances that Tatunca was a "genuine Amazonian Indian" who 
was capable and responsible? 
</P>
<P>
Even when warned by the State Department in early 1981 that John Reed could be 
in danger, his mother had said she did not want anyone to search for him. She 
felt he was following his plan to live with the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1984, Sandy Reed was reading her local newspaper when she spotted a 
small story from Rio de Janeiro. It said a West German journalist had been 
killed during a robbery attempt. His name was Karl Brugger. 
</P>
<P>
"I wondered if it was somehow connected to Johnny," said Reed. "I was really 
worried. I thought of going to Brazil to try to find him, but I kept postponing 
it, hoping for some news from Johnny." 
</P>
<P>
Five years later came worse news. A West German adventurer told the Reeds that 
the West German police suspected Tatunca of killing three people in the Amazon, 
including John Reed. They wrote the police for details, and the reply brought 
another shock: Not only was Tatunca Nara a suspect in three homicides, he was 
actually a West German citizen. 
</P>
<P>
The letter ended with a disheartening assessment: "The corpse of your son was 
never found, and there is little hope that the mortal remains might ever be 
discovered." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Reed quit her sales job, scraped together what money she could and began 
arranging the long-delayed trip to South America from her home near San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
She had always admired her brother, who was two years older. He was not just a 
dreamer but a doer who had always followed his convictions. Now she would 
follow hers and find out what happened to him. To do that, she would have to 
find Tatunca Nara. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1989, she flew to Manaus, an isolated city of 1.2 million about 900 
miles from the Atlantic Ocean in the heart of the Amazon. Farther up the Rio 
Negro, two days by boat and two hours by plane, was Barcelos, the home of 
Tatunca Nara. 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, Manaus was a boom town where rubber barons built 
colonial mansions overlooking the river. An opera house was erected out of 
stone and marble shipped from Italy in 1896; Caruso once sang there. Instant 
tycoons sent their soiled clothes to England for cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the rubber boom is long gone and so is the prosperity. Manaus is clogged 
with pollution, begging children and crumbling concrete buildings. About 200 
foreign-owned assembly plants, paying low wages and turning out goods from 
television sets to sunglasses, ring the city. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Reed spent three weeks there in 1989, badgering a Brazilian prosecutor 
about her brother's disappearance and scouring the city for scraps of 
information about John and Tatunca Nara. 
</P>
<P>
A friendly tour agent looked at John's picture and thought she might have seen 
him on the outskirts of the city, dazed and wearing large black rubber boots. 
The prosecutor said Tatunca told him two miners had spotted someone fitting 
John's description with an Indian tribe a few months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Before going to Manaus, Reed had arranged a meeting with James R. Fish, the 
part-time U.S. consular agent who had written several letters to her family. 
Fish did not show up for the meeting. So, Reed tracked him down in Fortaleza, a 
resort city on the Atlantic, flew there and confronted him in an exchange that 
she tape-recorded. 
</P>
<P>
Fish described Tatunca delivering her brother's final letters to his office in 
late 1980, claiming Reed had run away from him. Fish said he figured John had 
found "an interesting situation" in the jungle and had decided to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed about his assurances in a 1981 letter that Tatunca was a "genuine 
Amazonian Indian," Fish said: "He is not an authentic Indian in the sense of 
being born with Indian blood in him. But he does all the things that Indians 
do. All the people in Manaus that you talk to say that his trip is the real 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Back in Manaus, Sandy Reed was warned not to try to meet Tatunca. Barcelos was 
too remote, the sort of place where someone could be killed quietly and 
anonymously. She grew frightened and moved from cheap hotel to cheap hotel each 
night, always registering under a different name. 
</P>
<P>
She decided not to confront Tatunca -- at least not then, and not alone. 
</P>
<P>
One story she heard during this period was more terrifying than all the others. 
A former Swissair pilot reportedly had gone into the jungle with Tatunca in 
1981 and come upon a headless skeleton lying in a green nylon hammock. Beneath 
the hammock lay a hair brush and tooth brush. Tatunca reportedly had said that 
the bones, hammock and personal items were those of John Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Reed flew to Zurich, where the ex-pilot, Ferdinand Schmid, repeated the 
story. He said Tatunca had tossed the bones into the river and given the 
hammock to an Indian boy. He gave Reed a photo of the boy holding the hammock. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of Schmid's, who had gone on a later trip with Tatunca, said the guide 
had told him that John Reed had been living with an Indian tribe when he 
ventured too close to a woman bathing in a river and was shot to death by her 
jealous husband. 
</P>
<P>
From Zurich, Sandy Reed took a train to Wiesbaden, West Germany, and spent a 
long evening discussing the case with Kurt Hartert, the German detective. 
Hartert was sympathetic but uncertain about the chances of solving the mystery. 
There were no bodies, and the Brazilians were blocking his attempts to 
interrogate Tatunca. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only come to the truth when you break Tatunca -- when you are able to 
convince him that he must say he is Guenther Hauck," Hartert said. 
</P>
<P>
Reed refused to let go. Returning home to Northern California, she began 
cleaning houses for $12 an hour to earn money for a return trip to Brazil. At 
36, she could have been building a career, but she needed to be able to resume 
her search at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
She talked with Wolfgang Brog, a West German documentary producer who was 
gathering information about the disappearances for a television show. She flew 
to Munich and met with him. They arranged to rendezvous in Manaus to track down 
Tatunca. 
</P>
<P>
Her second trip to the Amazon was planned for late last month. This time, Reed 
would go on to Barcelos. A Times reporter and Brog would go along. 
</P>
<P>
"There are days when I don't feel Johnny is alive," said Reed as she packed for 
the trip. "The evidence that I'm collecting makes me think he's not alive. I 
don't know. Somewhere in my heart, oh . . . I guess I can't know until I face 
Tatunca." 
</P>
<P>
On June 21, Sandy Reed arrived in Manaus and checked into a $20-a-night hotel 
on a noisy downtown street. She spent several days tracking down new 
information, doggedly scribbling in a small red notebook and tape-recording 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon, after failing to find the local prosecutor in his office, she 
paid an unexpected visit to his home. Joao Bosco Sa Valente was polite enough, 
perhaps even a bit embarrassed, as he admitted that he had made no progress 
since their meeting a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only me doing this case," Valente lamented, turning up the palms of both 
hands. "Nobody helps." 
</P>
<P>
Valente said his requests for assistance from the federal police had been 
ignored. He said he had documents showing that Tatunca once worked for the 
Brazilian army, and he speculated that the military might be protecting him. 
</P>
<P>
"Very strange things happen around this case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, the federal police said Valente had never asked for help. 
They showed Reed their own file on Tatunca Nara. She was stunned. Rather than 
the names of her brother, Wanner and Heuser, the file concerned two different 
people -- an Austrian man and a woman from New Zealand -- who had disappeared 
separately after saying that they were going into the jungle with Tatunca. 
Tatunca told the police that he put them on boats back to Manaus and never saw 
them again. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no proof," said a federal police officer in Brazil, who asked that his 
name not be used. "We never found any bodies and no eyewitnesses or anything. 
All we have is hypothesis." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, July 2, a clerk at Reed's hotel placed an anonymous call to the only 
telephone in Barcelos. Yes, Tatunca Nara was in town. He was at the Hotel 
Oasis, the three-room inn on the Rio Negro that he and his father-in-law had 
built years before. 
</P>
<P>
Arrangements had to be made hurriedly. The small scheduled airline to Barcelos 
was flying up the next day, but no return was available until Thursday. Two 
nights in Tatunca's territory, where he ran the only hotel, seemed a foolish 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
A series of telephone calls and a substantial amount of cash secured the 
promise of a chartered airplane. It would be waiting at the Manaus airport the 
next morning. 
</P>
<P>
Reed slept little that night, tossing restlessly in her bed. In the dark early 
morning, her hands were shaking as she cradled a cup of coffee. She stuffed a 
knapsack and the pockets of her bush jacket with a tape recorder, a small 
notebook, a red folder containing documents and, emblazoned with the words "Top 
Secret," pictures of her brother and his last letters from the Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the hotel room, she reached down and yanked the buckle free on 
her leather belt, exposing a lethal-looking, four-inch dagger. Slashing 
horizontally across the belly of an imaginary foe, she said: "This is how my 
cousin showed me to use it. It doesn't even show up in an airport metal 
detector." 
</P>
<P>
The small twin-engine plane lifted off shortly after 10 a.m. and rose to 8,500 
feet. The Rio Negro spread out below, half a mile wide in places, black water 
laced with strips of bright green jungle and dotted by tiny islands. 
</P>
<P>
Reed had left her morning bravado on the ground. Replacing it was a mixture of 
fear, sadness and exhilaration as she approached the climax of her journey. She 
scanned her two-page list of questions for Tatunca, drawing a heavy line under 
the first one: "What happened to my brother?" 
</P>
<P>
She leafed through her brother's letters and extracted one found among Karl 
Brugger's papers after his death. It was dated Nov. 24, 1980. John Reed had 
said that he had met Tatunca in Manaus that day and gone with him to Barcelos. 
They were about to set off for Akakor, and Reed was excited. But there was a 
note of doubt about Tatunca. 
</P>
<P>
"Is he a liar or a prince?" he wrote to Brugger. 
</P>
<P>
The plane bounced twice and settled onto the rough landing strip that had been 
chopped out of the jungle at Barcelos. It was almost noon, and the sun was hot. 
There was no breath of wind. The dense foliage pushed against the edges of the 
unshaded road leaving the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Unsmiling children watched the athletic, auburn-haired woman walk through the 
town, occasionally whistling in an eerie, low monotone. Along the river bank, a 
girl of 6 or 7 bathed naked in the water beside a beached houseboat. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, there was the Hotel Oasis, perched on a high bank above the Rio 
Negro. It was more a large home than a hotel. Just inside the wooden gate, 
watching the strangers approach, was Tatunca Nara. He wore only a pair of 
patterned shorts. A turtle was tattooed on his chest. His eyes and hair were 
brown, and he was deeply tanned. His features were sharp, more European than 
Indian, and he was lean and muscular. 
</P>
<P>
Smiling warmly, he invited the visitors in and directed them to the shaded 
veranda overlooking the river. Reed and her companions sat at a small table and 
sipped Cokes in silence while Tatunca finished his lunch. 
</P>
<P>
When Tatunca moved to the small table, Reed brought out the pictures of her 
brother and identified herself. A broad smile crossed Tatunca's face as he 
shook her hand and asked, "Why didn't you come years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
"They told me you are a dangerous man," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
She began to question him gently, retelling the stories that had circulated 
about those who had disappeared -- her brother, Herbert Wanner, Christine 
Heuser. 
</P>
<P>
"These stories are crazy," said Tatunca. "It's crazy. I have killed no one." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he had barely known John Reed. They had spent only two or three 
days together, heading up the Rio Negro and the Rio Padauari. Tatunca wanted to 
return to Barcelos, but Reed insisted on staying. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'You don't go in the jungle. You are crazy.' But he wanted to see 
the Indians," said Tatunca. 
</P>
<P>
Reed shook her head in disbelief. Her brother's letters indicated that he had 
spent at least 10 days with Tatunca and the guide had promised to show him 
Akakor. 
</P>
<P>
What about Schmid, she asked -- the Swiss who said Tatunca had shown him bones 
in a hammock and said they were her brother's? 
</P>
<P>
"It's absurd," Tatunca said. He insisted that the bones were from a wild pig he 
had killed some months before. And he said they were beneath the hammock, not 
in it. The hammock and other items, he said, were his. "I was just joking with 
him. I said only, 'Maybe someone died here.' " 
</P>
<P>
He told of two gold miners who had come out of the jungle about a year ago and 
described seeing a tall blond man living with the Indians. "Nobody knows who 
this blond guy is," he said. "Maybe your brother is still alive." 
</P>
<P>
When Tatunca grew agitated or needed to explain something complicated, he 
abandoned English and Portuguese and launched into fast, fluent German. He said 
he had spent seven years in West Germany. But he denied that he was born and 
reared there, claiming that his birthplace was near the border of Peru and 
Brazil. Sure, he knew of Akakor. No, he had never promised to take anyone 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of Brugger's book irritated him. Pointing both thumbs down, he 
denounced the book as "80% lies." But when asked if he killed Brugger, he said, 
"I did not kill him -- he was my blood brother. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would I kill a man? For what? No reason. No reason." 
</P>
<P>
As the questioning wore on, Reed appeared to grow more incredulous. Tatunca's 
story conflicted too sharply with her brother's letters and with the stories 
she had heard from others around the world. If Tatunca were telling the truth, 
then her brother had lied. She could never accept that. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Reed could endure no more. She rose from her chair, fists clenched. 
Tatunca jumped up too. 
</P>
<P>
Tears streaming down her face, Reed spoke each word clearly and deliberately: 
"Tatunca, you are a liar. I have no respect for you. I hate you. You killed my 
brother. You killed my brother." 
</P>
<P>
Tatunca winced under the blunt accusation and pleaded: "No, Miss Reed. What 
motive? What motive? Why would I kill your brother?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because you're crazy -- and you will pay for my brother's death," Reed 
responded sharply. 
</P>
<P>
She gathered up her papers and tape recorder and walked through the door and 
into the road without turning. Tatunca slumped into his chair and shook his 
head slowly. 
</P>
<P>
The road back to the airport was as hot as a sauna. Reed ducked into a tiny 
grocery store and emerged with two large bottles of Antarctica beer and plastic 
cups tucked in her blue knapsack. At the empty terminal, she pried off a beer 
cap with a Swiss army knife. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I know my brother is dead," she said calmly, as if some chasm of 
suffering and uncertainty had been bridged. "Tatunca lied to me about 
everything. It's time to get this behind me. But Johnny would have been proud 
of me." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, the plane lifted off, swept low over Barcelos and the Rio 
Negro and climbed into the sky. Dark clouds were visible in the west; the 
pilots were in a hurry to beat the storm.

BUSH PLAN CALLS FOR BIG HIKE IN ALCOHOL TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration has proposed sharp increases in federal excise taxes on 
alcohol -- including a boost of 73 cents in the levy for each bottle of table 
wine -- as part of its opening proposal in negotiations with congressional 
leaders on a deficit-reduction package. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's plan, endorsed by Republican congressional negotiators at 
the budget summit as a preliminary bargaining position, would tax the alcohol 
content of beer, wine and liquor equally at 25 cents an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, however, has said that he is not "locked in" to any proposal, 
and Democratic negotiators have yet to receive the proposal, much less sign off 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would go up from 16 cents to 81 cents on a six-pack of beer, from 3 
cents to 76 cents on a bottle of wine and from $1.98 to $2.54 on a 
750-milliliter bottle of 80-proof liquor. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue gains from the alcohol taxes would amount to an estimated $7.2 billion 
in the year starting Oct. 1, or more than one-third of the $20.2-billion 
increase in net tax revenues from the Bush package. 
</P>
<P>
The plan came under sharp attack Saturday from the National Wine Coalition, 
which said the higher wine taxes would have a "devastating" impact, lowering 
sales by 20% and eliminating 96,000 jobs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"The substantial price rise and decline in sales that will result if the Bush 
Administration's excise tax plan is carried out will imperil the vast majority 
of those in the wine industry who run small family businesses," said John 
Volpe, executive director of the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
In a related report, the Congressional Budget Office said that the higher 
excise taxes on alcohol would cost the average family $101 more a year, with 
the biggest burden falling on poor people who spend a larger proportion of 
their income on liquor, wine and beer. 
</P>
<P>
A budget office study said the one-fifth of the population with the lowest 
incomes spend $308 a year on alcohol, or 3.7% of their income, compared to 
$1,210, or 1.6%, spent by those in the top 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Another tax aspect of the Administration's deficit-cutting package, the 
proposal for a $10,000 limit on the federal deduction of state and local taxes, 
also came under attack Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of its annual meeting in Mobile, Ala., the National Governors' Assn. 
released a letter sent to Bush on Thursday in which association chairman Terry 
E. Branstad, a Republican from Iowa, and vice chairman Booth Gardner, a 
Democrat from Washington state, warned that the governors oppose "any 
restrictions on the deductibility of state and local taxes as unacceptable 
encroachment on state systems of taxation." 
</P>
<P>
The letter also asserted that "state governments have been severely impacted by 
reductions in discretionary grants over the last decade and that the current 
fiscal situation of many states is precarious." 
</P>
<P>
A proposal in the Administration package that would freeze cost-of-living 
adjustments on pensions of nearly 4 million military and federal retirees also 
is controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Several California members of the House objected to the suggested increase in 
wine, beer and liquor taxes, saying it would unfairly place too much of the 
burden of reducing the federal deficit on those least able to afford it. 
</P>
<P>
"I am personally opposed to these (excise) taxes," said Rep. Jerry Lewis of 
Redlands, the third-ranking Republican leader in the House. "Many of us 
(Republicans) are expressing very strong concern about sales taxes that are 
very regressive and have the biggest impact on the middle-class working 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) said that the proposed increase would upset the 
traditional differential in alcohol taxation whereby higher levies were imposed 
on hard liquor compared to wine. 
</P>
<P>
As a major wine-producing state, Fazio added, California may get a "double 
whammy" because of possible increases in state wine taxes through legislation 
or initiatives on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make it very clear that an excise tax on wine is not going to be 
the only answer," said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). "There has to be 
some sharing of the burden." 
</P>
<P>
In its analysis, the National Wine Coalition said an increase in the wine tax 
to 76 cents a bottle would result in a loss of 94,000 jobs, a total of $1.5 
billion in wages and a drop of $362 million in state and local tax revenues 
because of lost sales. 
</P>
<P>
"For every dollar the federal government will generate from this increase in 
the federal excise tax, state and local governments will lose about 32 cents," 
according to the analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"Major wine-producing states, such as California, New York, Texas, Florida, 
Washington, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan, will be especially hard 
hit," the coalition's statement added. "Sales of wine can be expected to fall 
by over 20%." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition is composed of winemakers, industry allies and wine consumers.

<P>
State social service officials, citing numerous allegations of physical and 
mental abuse, have denied an operating license to Straight Inc., a nationally 
known adolescent drug treatment program that has come under fire for its 
confrontational methods. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida-based organization, one of the largest live-in drug programs for 
youth in the nation, had opened its first California treatment center a year 
ago in Yorba Linda and had applied for a license as a foster family agency. The 
facility's license had been pending since its opening in July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But in a letter sent to Straight's St. Petersburg headquarters in June, state 
authorities ordered the facility closed, citing evidence of "unusual 
punishment, infliction of pain and humiliation, mental abuse and withholding 
(of) medication," among other violations. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as July 19, the Yorba Linda program was served with notice that it 
was in violation of state law because it had continued to operate the facility, 
a misdemeanor that carries a fine of $200 per day and possible criminal 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
However, Straight officials said this week that the program has been shut down 
since the July 19 notice and that they are complying with Department of Social 
Service orders. Straight officials also strongly denied charges of abuse and 
said they are mystified by the state's action and will appeal the license 
denial. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not seen any of the documentation they are referring to so we have no 
idea what they mean," said Joy Margolis, Straight's vice president for 
communications. "In the letter that was sent to us they are in error in a lot 
of things they said. We have been meeting and working with the department since 
July of 1989 to make sure that we complied with state laws, and as far as we 
knew everything was going fine." 
</P>
<P>
Margolis said 68 people, most of them minors, were enrolled in the Straight 
program at Yorba Linda when it closed. The clients have been released to 
parents and families, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Norris, spokeswoman for the Department of Social Services, said the 
state's action was based on an extensive investigation and numerous complaints 
about Straight's tactics. She would not divulge details of the investigation, 
citing concerns about confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
Norris acknowledged that Straight officials have not been told of details of 
the alleged abusive incidents "but that type of thing will be included in the 
grounds for denial and they will have a chance to be fully heard and respond in 
front of an administrative law judge," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While Straight has garnered praise for its treatment program from President 
Bush and Nancy Reagan, among others, it has run afoul of licensing officials in 
several states for alleged abusive practices. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators in Virginia and Massachusetts are checking allegations of abuse 
at Straight's Springfield and Boston centers, the Dallas-area program is being 
monitored, the group was on probation in Florida last year and it has been sued 
in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of Straight's treatment program are daily "rap" sessions, at which 
clients are required to sit straight up in plastic chairs for as long as 10 
hours. Clients must confess their drug abuse at the sessions, and if 
uncooperative, they are verbally attacked. 
</P>
<P>
At night, the youngsters are taken to "host homes" -- usually the homes of 
parents of other Straight clients who have agreed to house the kids for up to a 
year. The owners of the "host homes" are expected to equip bedroom windows and 
doors with alarms and other security devices to prevent escape. 
</P>
<P>
California authorities allege that Straight has failed to comply with several 
state regulations and has violated health and safety code requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"Documentation on file indicates that there have been incidents where children 
have been subjected (to) unusual punishment, infliction of pain, humiliation, 
intimidation, ridicule, coercion, threat, mental abuse, or other actions of a 
punitive nature, including . . . interference with daily living functions such 
as eating, sleeping, or toileting or withholding of medication," according to a 
June 27 letter to Straight signed by Fred Dumont, the Department of Social 
Services' Santa Ana district manager. 
</P>
<P>
The state also alleges that "certification of host homes, placement of children 
and social work practices" are not in accordance with standards established by 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
Public records on file at the Santa Ana office contain several complaints from 
former Straight clients and a physician at a San Bernardino County hospital who 
had treated a 17-year-old female Straight client. Social Services officials 
deleted the doctor's name on the public copy of his complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The girl had been taken to Straight for a substance abuse problem, but the 
doctor said it was "questionable" whether she actually had one, according to 
the complaint filed July 19. 
</P>
<P>
"She related to me that she was being 'held against her will' at Straight . . . 
that there was 'a code of silence' where people at Straight were unable to talk 
with either their families or with anyone on the outside about what transpired 
in the program," the doctor wrote. "She reported to me that if she did not sit 
up straight, she would be restrained forcibly and rather violently on the floor 
with her face down. The staff would then pin her arms and legs up behind her 
back." 
</P>
<P>
In another complaint dated July 23, a former client relates being "restrained 
by my mouth being covered and my arms held down, not being able to breath. I 
advised Straight that I was in pain several times but was denied medical 
treatment for two and one half weeks . . . I was denied bathroom privileges for 
up to two to three hours . . . I was afraid to say or do anything wrong for 
fear of being restrained, yelled at or having my mouth covered." 
</P>
<P>
Margolis said she was unaware of the incidents and said that Straight does not 
physically abuse or unnecessarily restrain clients. 
</P>
<P>
"Clients," she said, "are not allowed to restrain other clients. Only staff 
members (are allowed), and only when it becomes necessary. For example, when a 
client is physically violent." 
</P>
<P>
Margolis said Straight had not been notified about any complaints "lodged 
against the California program." 
</P>
<P>
"To our knowledge the (state) has not investigated the situation by going to 
Straight and asking us about it," she said. "There are two sides to every 
story. How much of this is accurate?"

SPLIT IN SOLIDARITY SETTLES INTO TWO CAMPS; 
</P>
<P>
POLAND: SCENE IS BEING SET FOR A PRESIDENTIAL SHOWDOWN BETWEEN WALESA AND PRIME 
MINISTER MAZOWIECKI.

<P>
The scene is being set in Poland for an election showdown between Solidarity 
union leader Lech Walesa and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, as the split in 
the former Communist opposition movement settles into two broad camps. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Walesa nor Mazowiecki has reached the stage of declaring himself a 
candidate for the presidency, a post now held by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the 
former Communist Party leader whose term has five more years to run. 
</P>
<P>
But figures on both sides of the Solidarity split are pushing for elections 
this fall, and Jaruzelski has hinted that he will readily step aside should 
Parliament move for early parliamentary and presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
The latest grouping to emerge is the Democratic Action group, known by its 
Polish acronym ROAD. Led by Zbigniew Bujak and Wladislaw Frasyniuk, heroes of 
Solidarity's underground years, it attracted 1,000 charter members to a meeting 
Saturday to officially launch itself as a political party. ROAD has thrown its 
considerable weight behind Mazowiecki and his year-old government. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side is the Center Agreement, which is pushing Walesa for the 
presidency. The party's leading organizer is Lech Kaczynski, a longtime Walesa 
aide and one of his key political operatives. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to bridge the gap between Walesa and Mazowiecki, including a session 
between the two principals, failed to resolve differences between the camps. 
So, the liberals of the Democratic Action group pressed ahead with their 
organizational plans, unified by the goal of blocking Walesa's drive for the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Action's founders are trying to avoid labels of "left" or "right," 
arguing that they make little sense in a country finding its way through a 
thicket of post-Communist economic and political changes. Nevertheless, most 
political observers regard the grouping as liberal. 
</P>
<P>
"We are organizing around a certain vision of Poland, not for or against 
anyone," Frasyniuk said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that disclaimer, Frasyniuk, Bujak and other activists in the group are 
clearly opposed to a Walesa presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"Walesa has had a great role in Poland," said Adam Michnik, the editor of 
Solidarity's daily newspaper and a longtime opposition activist. 
</P>
<P>
"He can have a great role in the future as well, when he considers himself a 
citizen and not a god," Michnik went on. "He is my friend, and I say this from 
friendship, not from maliciousness. He has a special role in Poland, but he is 
not a baby whose rules and desires and admonitions should automatically be 
satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
"There is polarization taking place inside Solidarity," Bujak told delegates at 
the meeting Saturday. "This does not have to be bad. A democratic country is a 
country of different proposals. We will have to forget about the otherwise 
comfortable structure in which the picture was black and white -- just us 
against them." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa was the virtually undisputed head of Solidarity, the East Bloc's first 
free trade union, from its inception in 1980 through its election victory over 
the Communists last year. It was Walesa who handpicked Mazowiecki, a longtime 
Solidarity adviser, as the first non-Communist prime minister in postwar 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bargain struck with the Communists, the presidency went to 
Jaruzelski, and Walesa, who sought no role in the day-to-day government, 
returned to his union headquarters in Gdansk. 
</P>
<P>
"Since then," said Janusz Onyskiewicz, formerly the Solidarity spokesman and 
now a deputy defense minister, "Walesa has been out of the loop, but he has 
been out of it by his own choosing. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the situation has changed. People in the government have their own base, 
their own constituencies. They see no reason why they should consult with 
Walesa. If something goes wrong, they will take the blame for it, not Walesa. 
So, they are much more independent." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, isolated from the core group of activists who once advised 
him and who are now busy in the government or Parliament, Walesa has sniped at 
Mazowiecki's administration, accusing it of moving too slowly to reform 
Poland's political system and to root out the Communist apparatchiks still at 
work throughout government institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Andrzej Malachowski, a member of the Democratic Action group, acknowledges some 
government mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has been slow to make changes in some areas -- the diplomatic 
service, the justice and interior ministries," he said. "Sometimes, it seems to 
some people that certain areas have been turned over to incompetent people. All 
of this is deepened by the fact that there are people in society who naturally 
think of revenge, people who suffered at the hands of the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
"So it is a dangerous game Walesa is playing now, fighting for power. There is 
a danger that he will build around him a party of the dissatisfied. Although I 
think he is a decent man himself, he may be inviting the establishment of an 
authoritarian movement in Europe, and this would be bad." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Action supporters are pointing to the sharp rhetoric of the Center 
Agreement as an expression of what they see as a dangerously nationalistic 
tendency in the group, for which they blame not Walesa but his most vocal 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"The Center group," Malachowski said, "says that those who are opposed to it 
were former (Communist) Party members. Therefore, they awake the old myths, 
even prewar myths, that the Jews, the Freemasons and Communists are to blame 
for everything." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes," Michnik said, "Walesa has spoken wisely and responsibly. But one 
thing that bothers me is a populist rhetoric in his speech that makes him a 
banner for all these disaffected people." It is not that Walesa has actively 
sought the disaffected, Michnik said, but rather that they have rallied around 
him.

EX-AUSTRIAN CHANCELLOR KREISKY DIES

Former Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, the most popular political leader in 
postwar Austria, died today, doctors said. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
Kreisky was hospitalized with a heart condition last week and had been in 
critical condition, one of his doctors said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Kreisky dominated Austrian political life for two decades and was chancellor 
from 1970 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
He stepped down as chancellor after his Socialist Party failed to win a 
majority in parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, after indecisive elections forced the Socialists to form a government 
with the Austrian People's Party, their conservative rivals, Kreisky broke with 
the party and even renounced his honorary chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
He had lived in virtual seclusion for the last few years, largely because of 
his health problems. Kreisky had undergone a kidney transplant several years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
He had received medical treatment for circulatory problems for some time, but 
his heart condition had "seriously worsened during the last 24 hours," the 
Austria Press Agency quoted Dr. Wolfgang Enekel as saying Saturday.

BALTICS REFUSE TO JOIN TALKS ON FORMING FEDERAL STATE; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: THEY WILL PROCEED WITH SECESSION. GORBACHEV SUFFERS A SETBACK.

<P>
The Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania declared Saturday that 
they will not participate in the negotiations to transform the Soviet Union 
into a federal state with broad autonomy for its members. 
</P>
<P>
The three Baltic presidents, meeting in the Latvian beach resort of Jurmala, 
said their republics instead will proceed with talks on their own independence 
from the Soviet Union and on their future relations with Russia and the other 
republics that remain in the federal union. 
</P>
<P>
The three presidents -- Arnold Ruutel of Estonia, Anatolijs Gorbunovs of Latvia 
and Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania -- also agreed to negotiate jointly with 
the Soviet central government or, if Moscow does not agree to this 
"three-plus-one" formula, then to coordinate their talks on independence. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic decision, while expected, will undermine President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's efforts to hold the Soviet Union together in the face of the 
centrifugal pressures of growing nationalism in virtually all its 15 
constituent republics. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who is struggling despite increasing challenges to maintain the 
Soviet Union's integrity as a state, had hoped that the Baltic republics would 
at least join the negotiations on the treaty establishing a new federal union 
even if they did not join the union. 
</P>
<P>
Their decision not to remain even as observers could add to sentiment, already 
considerable in republics such as Armenia, Georgia and the Ukraine, that the 
negotiations as now constituted are futile and should be abandoned in favor of 
open-ended talks without preconceptions of the result. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic drive for independence was appreciably strengthened by an agreement 
reached Friday by the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian presidents with Boris N. 
Yeltsin, the populist president of Russia, the largest Soviet republic, on 
continuing cooperation as they secede from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
A series of treaties will be drafted in the next two months that should go a 
long way to ensuring a smooth transition -- as well as recognizing the 
independence of the Baltic states because this will be part of the preamble of 
each agreement. 
</P>
<P>
In the agreement reached with Yeltsin, the three Baltic presidents said 
negotiations will begin immediately on long-term cooperation in economic 
development, trade, science and technology and cultural relations. Citizenship, 
repatriation and welfare benefits will also be included in the treaties. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of Soviet politics, the agreement puts Yeltsin well ahead of Gorbachev 
in coping with the country's impending disintegration, for Russia under Yeltsin 
will be playing a larger and possibly more effective role in shaping the new 
relationship than the central government under Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"Latvian independence must definitely be recognized in the first, the political 
section of our treaty," Yeltsin said in an inter view with Latvian television. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin met with the Baltic presidents at Jurmala, where he has been 
vacationing, and then joined them and their wives for a dinner of fish that he 
and Gorbunovs had caught. Landsbergis, a concert pianist and professor of 
musicology, played the piano to entertain the party, and Yeltsin's wife 
assembled the participants for a group photo. 
</P>
<P>
As shown on Latvian television in a report from Jurmala, the convivial and 
relaxed Yeltsin was a marked contrast to Gorbachev, usually tense and irritated 
when dealing with Baltic questions. The effect of the report, probably 
intended, almost seemed to be one of reassurance that here was a man with whom 
the republics could work. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev earlier this month called a new union treaty vital to his plans to 
transform the country's centrally planned, state-run economy into one in which 
the market forces of supply and demand and entrepreneurship predominate. 
</P>
<P>
In their declaration, issued Saturday after a meeting that continued well past 
midnight, the three Baltic presidents said their republics have no territorial 
or other claims on each other.

100 REPORTED HELD HOSTAGE IN PICCADILLY NIGHTCLUB

Police said today that a gunman was holding possibly as many as 100 people 
hostage in a London nightclub, and a witness who escaped said he believes 
members of the Kuwaiti royal family were among them. 
</P>
<P>
Ambulance officers who drove to the scene to await developments said they had 
no reports of anyone being hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Armed police also were outside the building housing Tokyo Joe's, a club popular 
in London's Middle Eastern community and located off Piccadilly. 
</P>
<P>
Police said negotiations were being conducted with the aid of an interpreter, 
although the man spoke some English. They said they do not know his 
nationality. 
</P>
<P>
Others who got out of the club said the man appeared to be Middle Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Staff and visitors who were in the street said the police were called early 
today after a man with a gun was seen walking through the packed club toward 
the basement area about 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Tuerena, 38, the doorman, said he was standing in the reception area 
when he came face to face with a man armed with two guns, a knife and what 
appeared to be a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some people moving at the time and this man just pushed them back 
and ran in," Tuerena said. "He had a shotgun in one hand, a handgun in the 
other and a knife pushed in his trousers that was like a little sword or a 
rapier." 
</P>
<P>
Tuerena said he led two club members to safety through an emergency exit before 
the gunman realized what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
Yacoub Ibrahim, who said he is in London on vacation and had been inside, told 
a reporter that members of the Kuwaiti royal family were in the club. Ibrahim 
said he had not seen them since he escaped and believed they were still inside. 
</P>
<P>
Jamal Elamery, an Egyptian working in London for a Saudi Arabian family, said 
he was on his way into the club to join friends when he was caught in a crowd 
of people leaving it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just going in when I saw a lot of people panicking and leaving. I turned 
round and joined in the rush," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others who managed to get out said about 200 people were in the club when the 
gunman entered. 
</P>
<P>
After daylight with the siege more than four hours old, a police officer said: 
"People are still trickling out of the premises. I think as the opportunity 
arises they break for cover. A handful of people have come out in the last 
hour, mainly women," he said.

U.S.-JAPAN TIES STRONG, BAKER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHEAST ASIA: A MALAYSIAN VOICES FEAR THAT FRICTION BETWEEN TOKYO AND 
WASHINGTON COULD THREATEN REGION'S SECURITY.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III came to the defense of Japan on Saturday 
after a top Southeast Asian official voiced fears that growing Japanese power 
plus friction between Washington and Tokyo could threaten the security of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was raised by Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar of Malaysia during a 
closed-door meeting here of the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations. Citing the 
decline in East-West tensions and some U.S. public opinion polls showing that 
Americans see Japan as their top economic threat, Hassan wondered if Japan 
might replace the Soviet Union as Southeast Asia's main security worry. 
</P>
<P>
Hassan's remarks reflected general uncertainty among Southeast Asian officials 
about how rapidly changing relations among the world's leading powers could 
affect Asia and the Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get clarification from the Japanese," Hassan explained to 
reporters afterward. 
</P>
<P>
According to both Japanese and American accounts, Baker quickly intervened in 
the discussion and sought to dispel any fears. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Baker raised his hand and said that, although some people (in the United 
States) feel that way, it is a minority," Japanese spokesman Makoto Yamanaka 
said. "He (Baker) made it clear that a majority of the American people believe 
in good relations between Japan and the United States." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Baker also sought to counteract an impression that the 
United States and Japan might be at loggerheads with each other, now or in the 
future. On the contrary, Baker said, Japan and the United States have expanded 
their political and security ties over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials said the ASEAN delegates' discussion prompted Japanese 
Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama to voice regrets over Japan's seizure of 
Southeast Asia in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"(Nakayama) deplored what Japan did before and during the last world war," said 
spokesman Yamanaka. " . . . We caused agonies and trouble to people in Asia and 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Nakayama "made it very clear that . . . it is the consensus of the Japanese 
people not to become a military power in this region (Southeast Asia)," the 
Japanese spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is now the largest investor in the ASEAN nations and the region's 
principal trading partner. The association's six countries -- Thailand, 
Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei -- have a population 
of more than 300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two days, Japan has been seeking support from Southeast Asian 
officials for its current foreign policy goals, particularly its desire to 
recover what it calls the four "northern territories" -- four islands in the 
Kurile chain that have been occupied by the Soviet Union since the end of World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
Nakayama also urged ASEAN members to normalize their relations with China. At 
the recent summit of the seven leading industrialized nations in Houston, Japan 
announced that it will go forward with a package of more than $5 billion in 
loans to China, even though the summit decided to maintain, for now, a ban on 
World Bank and other international lending to China. 
</P>
<P>
"We strongly expect China to continue to uphold its policies of openness toward 
the outside world and to pursue further its economic and political reforms," a 
Japanese spokesman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, Japan would favor the inclusion of China in a new 
economic organization for Asia and the Pacific but would oppose the admission 
of the Soviet Union into the same organization.

FUJIMORI TAKES OFFICE IN PERU, VOWS A REBIRTH

<TEXT>
<P>
Political newcomer Alberto Fujimori took office Saturday as the 107th president 
of beleaguered Peru, pledging to rebuild an economy ravaged by inflation, drugs 
and guerrilla war. 
</P>
<P>
The new president also attacked corruption in government, offered dialogue with 
Marxist rebels and promised fairer treatment for the South American nation's 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
The bespectacled former college president -- an independent whose Change 90 
party won an upset victory in June elections -- accepted the red-and-white sash 
of office and said, "I swear by God" to try to solve the nation's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori was celebrating his 52nd birthday on Saturday, which is also Peru's 
Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
His comments at the ceremony in the red-carpeted, cedar-paneled House of 
Representatives chamber brought cheers from lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
But the inauguration was marred when outgoing President Alan Garcia's farewell 
speech was interrupted by hoots and insults. 
</P>
<P>
While five visiting Latin American presidents looked on stoically, rightist 
congress members stopped Garcia from beginning his speech three times by 
banging their desks and jeering him. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia has been accused of ruining the country's economy and letting corruption 
run rampant. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori did not mention Garcia by name in his speech. But he said: "We 
inherited a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
The new leader faces daunting problems. While the illegal drug trade prospered 
during the previous government, Peru's economy shrank 3%, agricultural 
production fell by almost one-fifth, and inflation soared out of control, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said he will actively promote exports and encourage foreign investment 
in Peru by establishing a free-market economy, although he ruled out the sale 
of all state enterprises, most of which he said are near collapse. 
</P>
<P>
He announced the creation of an anti-corruption committee to investigate cases 
of fraud and graft, saying: "The people of Peru elected us to . . . restore 
honesty in the public administration." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding drugs, Fujimori took a stand similar to that of President Virgilio 
Barco Vargas of Colombia. Barco was on hand for the inauguration, along with 
the presidents of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said cocaine-consuming countries are just as responsible for stopping 
drug use as are South American nations that grow coca leaf and turn it into 
cocaine.

CHINA ASSAILS BRITISH HONG KONG OFFER

China denounced as "unacceptable" Saturday a British law granting passports and 
the right of abode in Britain to 50,000 key Hong Kong Chinese families and said 
it will not recognize the "erroneous action." 
</P>
<P>
China's vow of non-recognition appeared designed to undermine a key aim of the 
British Nationality Act, passed by the Parliament last week as a safety valve 
to give some key Hong Kong residents the confidence to stay in the territory 
after the colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing accused Britain of having "gone so far as to break its solemn 
commitment" to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration outlining the British 
colony's July 1, 1997, handover to China. It threatened unspecified measures in 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
The Nationality Act promises British passports and right of abode in Britain to 
50,000 leaders in Hong Kong business, government and cultural circles, allowing 
them to emigrate if Hong Kong's stability deteriorates as the Chinese takeover 
nears. 
</P>
<P>
British lawmakers, worried about a huge influx of Hong Kong Chinese, clearly 
had hoped British citizenship would keep program participants in Hong Kong 
beyond 1997.

TROLLEY RIDE RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finally, an article ("Running Scared?" July 22) on the San Diego Trolley! 
Although I was pleased to see a story regarding the trolley, I do not agree 
with its basic conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
The article states that statistically the trolley is extremely safe (.25 
incidents of crime per 1000,000 passengers). As we all know, statistics can be 
very misleading. What about all the unreported crimes that occur? For instance, 
one incident which happened not too long ago involved two men in an argument. 
The argument quickly evolved into an encounter in which one of the men pulled 
out a knife and started waving it around. Terrified passengers pushed the red 
emergency button several times to no avail. The trolley driver did not respond 
and continued on his course in order to reach the next station. Fortunately, no 
one was hurt, but this episode alone is enough to deter anyone from riding the 
trolley. 
</P>
<P>
Another episode, which I was a witness to, occurred at the Gaslamp (now 5th 
Avenue) station. A lady leaving work was waiting for the El Cajon trolley. 
While waiting, she was struck in the face and thrown to the ground by a 
vagrant. The lady remained lying on the ground until she was taken away in an 
ambulance. I can assure you that, if this lady still rides the trolley, she is 
more than "somewhat apprehensive." 
</P>
<P>
Langley Powell, president and general manager of San Diego Trolley Inc., states 
that feelings and perceptions are almost as critical as statistics. Due to the 
inaccurate nature of statistics, I would say that feelings and perceptions are 
paramount. And the feelings and perceptions of San Diego trolley passengers are 
far from favorable. While nothing has affected me directly, I do not feel the 
trolley is "up to par" in terms of safety. After numerous conversations with 
co-workers, I can assure you that my opinion is shared by several trolley 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The trolley is an essential transportation mode in today's world of 
overpopulated freeways, yet necessity may be overtaken by fear as business 
commuters return to the freeways. An added security measure which may dilute 
some of the concern on the trolley is an intercom system in which all trolley 
cars have direct communication with the driver. Intercoms are an integral part 
of the new Los Angeles "Blue Line." I see no reason why San Diego should not 
add this vital safety measure to their trolley system. 
</P>
<P>
If statistically the answer is clear, perceptively the answer is also clear: 
trolley commuters will continue "running scared" unless major changes take 
place!

DO THEY HAVE THEIR HEADS UNDER WATER?; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN LEGISLATIVE TRIO'S ACTIONS ON A BILL THAT WOULD 
CURTAIL WATER WASTE IN AGRICULTURE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN ALEXANDER, Brian Alexander is a free-lance writer who covers water-use 
issues for several San Diego publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somebody must have forgotten to tell Congressmen Duncan Hunter, Ron Packard and 
Bill Lowery about the drought. That seems to be the only explanation for a 
perplexing series of votes taken in the U.S. House of Representatives on a bill 
that the Senate will begin considering Tuesday -- a bill that also could put 
gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson on the hot seat as the Senate debate 
progresses. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by the drought and ample evidence of rivers of wasted water, urban 
California legislators, led by U.S. Rep. George Miller (D-Pleasant Hill), have 
been targeting farm areas, especially the Central Valley, for much-needed water 
reform. Last month, these reformers used HR 2567, the authorizing legislation 
for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's funding, as the vehicle for new 
regulations on water use in agricultural areas. 
</P>
<P>
They want to eliminate two practices. 
</P>
<P>
First, these legislators want to cut the so-called "double-subsidy." Currently, 
farmers in some agricultural areas are able to buy irrigation water from the 
Bureau of Reclamation at prices far below the cost of production. That's one of 
the two subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The other is crop subsidies. Crops such as cotton and wheat are subsidized in a 
variety of ways. In fact, the government is paying some farmers not to grow 
some of these crops. 
</P>
<P>
But farmers in California and elsewhere have been able to use subsidized water 
to grow subsidized crops. This is an example of the government working at 
cross-purposes, one as obvious as paying a subsidy to tobacco farmers while the 
Department of Health and Human Services tells us that tobacco can kill. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a huge waste of money and water. Marc Reisner, author of "Cadillac 
Desert," has estimated that if alfalfa, a low-value surplus crop, were 
eliminated from California's farming diet, it would free up enough water for 20 
million people and have relatively little impact on the farm economy. Alfalfa 
farmers could make as much money growing less water-intensive crops. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery (R-San Diego) did not vote on an amendment to cut this double subsidy. 
Packard (R-Carlsbad) and Hunter (R-Coronado) voted against cutting the double 
subsidy in contradiction of their usual fiscal conservatism and the interests 
of their urban constituents. Only 53 other representatives agreed with them. 
</P>
<P>
The other area ripe for farm reform relates to the 960-acre limit. 
Theoretically, farmers are allowed to irrigate farms of 960 acres or less with 
subsidized water. (The Imperial Valley is exempt from this restriction.) But 
many farmers, including corporations such as Exxon, Getty Oil and J. G. Boswell 
have farms many times that size. Congress set the 960-acre limit in 1982, but 
the reclamation bureau has allowed the exploitation of this trust loophole. 
</P>
<P>
Powerful Central Valley congressmen such as former majority whip Tony Coelho 
created a loophole for family trusts. In other words, you could have a farm of, 
say, 10,000 acres and divide it among members of your family. The Pruett family 
of the Central Valley and J. G. Boswell created multiple trusts. They were the 
same farms, of course, but on paper the land was divided. 
</P>
<P>
After Coelho left office due to inquiries about his personal finances, 
reformers saw an opening. But Hunter, Lowery and Packard tried to close it. 
They voted for an amendment that would exempt trusts from the limit. The 
amendment failed. 
</P>
<P>
(U.S. Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) voted to end double subsidies, restrict 
water to 960-acre farms and close the family trust loophole.) 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) is expected to approve the reforms. Insiders 
are not sure how Wilson will vote, but it is important to note that he has 
accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from growers' 
political action committees and J. G. Boswell's PAC. 
</P>
<P>
Water saved by the reform legislation could help ease the water crunch now 
being felt throughout California. California agriculture uses 85% of all 
developed water sources in the state. Even a small savings from this pool could 
be immensely beneficial -- if only indirectly -- to the semi-arid desert where 
we live. 
</P>
<P>
It could be used to help recharge depleted ground water reserves in the Central 
Valley, increase fresh water flows through the dying San Joaquin Delta or, at 
the very least, grow more of the high-value crops that use less water. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to all three Republican congressmen argued that there would be no 
guarantee that water saved in the Central Valley would be sent to San Diego, a 
display of ignorance about the interdependence of California's water system. 
</P>
<P>
A Packard spokesman said the congressman was fearful of a negative impact on 
the state's farm economy. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Lowery and Hunter argued that the House was not given enough 
information on which to base its votes since hearings were not held on this 
specific amendment to this specific bill. 
</P>
<P>
That's true. But these very same issues have been debated in House committees 
for over eight years, intensely so in 1982 and 1987. Reams of evidence exist, 
and the impacts of reform are well known. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter aide John Palafoutas suggested a scary scenario: 
</P>
<P>
"Duncan told me, 'John, I just went down to the floor and the word was that 
there hadn't been hearings, so I voted (the way I did). . . . Nobody seemed to 
know what was going on.' " 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps San Diego voters should educate Hunter, Lowery and Packard and keep an 
eye on Pete Wilson, a favorite of the growers' PACs and Boswell. As Packard 
recently stated when asked about a proposed landfill in his district, "When it 
comes to something as critical as water, we can't be too careful."DR, STEVE

ROSEANNE FALLOUT

<TEXT>
<P>
I booed Roseanne Barr. I was one of the working women supposedly being honored 
at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
(I don't know too many women who don't work.) 
</P>
<P>
She was just being herself, sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
We are always hoping for heroes. What we always get is a promoter choosing our 
heroes, hoping to make a buck and humiliating and demeaning us with the 
tastelessness of a Roseanne Barr. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the judgment by Tom Werner was a one-time excusable error. If not, look 
out Padre fans, last place could look good to us.

2 BANKS ROBBED, 1 ATTEMPT FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Banks in Oxnard, Camarillo and Ventura were hit by robbers in three days, and 
one man may be responsible for at least two of the similar crimes, authorities 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The First Nationwide Bank at 1055 S. Oxnard Blvd. was robbed at 11:20 a.m. 
Saturday, Oxnard Police Sgt. Frank Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
A man holding out an open Manila envelope approached a teller, indicated that 
he had a weapon and demanded money, Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
The teller put an undisclosed amount of money in the envelope, and the man 
fled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber was described as about 20 years old, with medium blond hair and a 
mustache. He was about 5 feet, 10 inches tall and wore a black sweater and 
khaki pants, Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
A man using a similar method tried to hold up the Ventura County National Bank 
at 502 Las Posas Road in Camarillo on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The man -- described as 5 feet, 10 inches tall with reddish crew-cut hair -- 
handed the teller a Manila envelope folded in half, Ventura County Sheriff's 
Lt. Kathy Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
When the teller unfolded the envelope, she found a written demand for money, 
Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
A second teller, unaware of the situation, came up and started chatting with 
the man. The man got nervous and ran out the door, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation believe that the same 
man may have held up a bank in Ventura on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, the robber, described only as a white adult, used a note to 
demand money from a teller at Security Pacific National Bank at 9493 Telephone 
Road, Ventura Police Officer Diann McCaskill said. The man claimed to have a 
gun, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI declined to comment on the three cases. CAROL WATSON

<P>
The trial of a Somis flower rancher charged with enslaving more than 100 
Mexican laborers has been set for March 5 in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Ives, 53, a Los Angeles resident, and seven of his employees will not 
face trial until next year because the U.S. attorney's office needs extra time 
to prepare, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Gillam said recently. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to take numerous depositions in Mexico and will run into problems 
over the holidays when several witnesses will be hard to get ahold of," Gillam 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillam said about 400 workers were forced to labor at sub-minimum wages and to 
buy food supplies at inflated prices from a company store. 
</P>
<P>
Ives is free on $150,000 bail. Five of his employees -- Pedro Pinzon, 30; Josue 
David Pinzon, 23; Rony Havive, 30; Alvaro Ruiz, 39; and Mauro Casares, 64 -- 
are free on $25,000 bail. Another defendant, Paringer Singh, 39, is free on 
$15,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are trying to extradite another of Ives' employees, Najuum Isaac, 30, 
from Israel to face charges. LAURA PITTER

POLLUTION SUIT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF CLEANING IT UP; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SUED EIGHT FIRMS THAT IT SAYS DUMPED 
TOXIC CHEMICALS ONTO AN UNDERSEA SHELF. BUT IT ISN'T SURE HOW TO DEAL WITH THE 
CONTAMINATION EVEN IF IT WINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sounds good on paper. The federal government sues companies responsible for 
polluting the Palos Verdes undersea shelf off White Point, forcing them to pay 
for restoring the injured marine resources there. 
</P>
<P>
That is the idea behind a lawsuit the government filed June 18 against eight 
companies that it holds responsible for polluting the shelf and several other 
areas of marine sediment along the Los Angeles County coast. 
</P>
<P>
But the litigation raises a question: Even if the government wins in court, how 
can it restore an area as vast as the shelf? 
</P>
<P>
High concentrations of the pesticide DDT, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 
other toxic chemicals are embedded in the shelf's sediment, much of it in water 
200 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
It is far trickier territory than the shallows of the harbor at New Bedford, 
Mass., or Commencement Bay near Tacoma, Wash., two other sites where federal 
restoration projects are planned. 
</P>
<P>
The shelf is "a nightmare cleanup situation," said Mark Gold, the staff 
biologist for Heal the Bay, a Santa Monica environmental group. "I wouldn't bet 
on anything." 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials plan a major study of all restoration options, including 
suction-dredging contaminated sediment, capping the area with clean sediment 
and cultivating microorganisms that break down the pollutants. They will also 
consider indirect methods, such as constructing hatcheries or artificial reefs 
to bolster marine life. 
</P>
<P>
"We will do as good a job as we can," said Grayson Cecil, special counsel for 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the lead agency in the 
federal lawsuit. "To shrug our shoulders and say 'Hey, let's give up' is just 
not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
The suit, based on a federal law called the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, assumes that some kind of restoration 
will be done. 
</P>
<P>
The act permits the government to sue for damages to natural resources, but it 
requires that the money recovered in such litigation be used "only to restore, 
replace, or acquire the equivalent of such natural resources." 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say a main goal of the law is to promote cleanup of polluted 
resources, but that is a tall order when it comes to the Palos Verdes shelf. 
</P>
<P>
The pollution there consists mainly of DDT, PCBs and other toxins released into 
the sewer system and pumped through ocean outfalls into the waters off White 
Point in the 1940s, '50s, '60s and early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of the toxins became embedded in sediments over a broad area of 
the shelf, and they are believed to have tainted the marine food chain, 
contaminating marine animals and birds that ate them. 
</P>
<P>
The shelf's sediments contain about 200 tons of DDT and between two and 20 tons 
of PCBs, according to the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, which 
operates the White Point outfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Testing of white croaker fish indicates that although much of the pollution is 
apparently sealed under a foot or more of newer sediment, it is still 
contaminating bottom-dwelling marine organisms. 
</P>
<P>
Even for the people most interested in cleaning it up, the shelf appears 
forbidding. 
</P>
<P>
"What you've got is a dark, cold, high-pressure and (oxygen-free) environment 
where chemicals like DDT will literally last for hundreds of years," said 
Malcolm Gordon, a biology professor at UCLA. "These are pretty difficult 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon and many other experts express doubt that suction dredging could be 
considered a viable alternative on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
Besides pointing to the size of the polluted area and the depths involved, they 
worry that dredging would disturb the sediment and release buried contaminants 
into the water. 
</P>
<P>
Under certain conditions, dredging can be used to remove tainted sediments. As 
part of the restoration project in New Bedford, for instance, the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency plans to remove harbor sediment that is 
contaminated with extremely high levels of PCBs. 
</P>
<P>
But the area being dredged is a small, well-defined "hot spot" of only five 
acres, and it is in shallow water. Experts fear that it might be far harder to 
control dredging off the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to do anything that would resuspend these contaminants," said 
Mark Helvey of the National Marine Fisheries Service, a division of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that is organizing a study of 
restoration alternatives. "That's open ocean, not a protected area like New 
Bedford." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rodolfo Iturriaga, an assistant professor of biology at USC: "It's like 
when you clean your carpet. Are you going to shake it out indoors and let the 
dust go inside the room?" 
</P>
<P>
Another option is to cap the polluted sediments with clean fill, in hopes that 
the contaminants will break down naturally, sealed off from contact with marine 
life. 
</P>
<P>
In Commencement Bay, an area of polluted sediment was capped in this manner in 
1987, and several other sites in the area are slated for capping in coming 
years, EPA officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But the sites in Washington state, like the hot spot in New Bedford, are 
well-defined areas of pollution in shallow water. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say dumping tons of sediment to cover polluted ocean bottom off the 
peninsula might cost a great deal and still not work. 
</P>
<P>
"Some marine geologists have been saying that if too heavy a load is deposited 
on top, it could cause the sediment to crack and slump and cause (DDT and PCB) 
releases," said Jack Anderson, director of the Southern California Coastal 
Water Research Project. "There's also some concern that marine animals could 
eventually reach down through that (clean) sediment." 
</P>
<P>
Some experts hold out hope that microorganisms capable of breaking down the 
pollutants could be isolated and nurtured on the shelf. Studies have shown that 
organisms exist that do break down DDT and PCBs, but it is uncertain how much 
of this can occur in the cold, oxygen-free shelf sediments. 
</P>
<P>
Though the use of microorganisms to neutralize pollutants -- a process called 
bioremediation -- is a fast-growing industry, those familiar with the field say 
it is still in its early stages. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Allen, a consultant in the New Bedford restoration, said his firm could 
not recommend bioremediation for the Massachusetts project because the process 
is still undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
"I can shovel PCBs into an incinerator and tell you it will destroy 99% of them 
and cost you X amount," said Allen, an engineer with ABB Environmental Services 
of Portland, Me. "With biodegradation you can't do that. We've seen numbers, 
but they're all over the board." 
</P>
<P>
That, however, could change. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, within the next decade someone will learn how to apply these 
processes (to marine sediments)," said Ronald Crawford, co-director of the 
Center for Hazardous Waste Remediation Research at the University of Idaho. "We 
know degradation occurs. Our next challenge is to learn how to speed it up." 
</P>
<P>
Gold of Heal the Bay says that although all cleanup options should be studied 
carefully, the federal government should also look at the possibility of 
forgoing direct restoration work. 
</P>
<P>
If studies show that the contaminants on the shelf are breaking down naturally 
and are unlikely to escape their natural barrier in large quantities, the 
wisdom of direct restoration work has to be questioned, Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it even worth risking the cleanup?" he asked. "If indeed a lot of (these) 
PCBs and DDT (were) resuspended, what would be the consequences?" 
</P>
<P>
For now, federal officials say they will consider all options in studies 
expected to take up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to rule anything out and say anything is too far off the wall at 
this point," said Helvey. "We're trying to be good scientists here, to be 
objective and see whether restoration is feasible, effective and what the costs 
are."

A BEACON ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Ferrick has been gone for nearly two years now. But along San Pedro's 
gritty Beacon Street, they'll tell you he's still saving lives. 
</P>
<P>
There's Jim, a tall, handsome kid, who has finally quit the drugs and alcohol 
and has just been accepted by Chapman College. And Louis, who used to be so 
strung out on heroin that he'd shoot up before, during and after each day he 
taught at an elementary school. And Tim the mechanic and Wayne the poet and 
Patrick the draftsman. 
</P>
<P>
You see, around Beacon House, a place where alcoholics and addicts have been 
getting help for 20 years, they all know the story of how Ron drank himself to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
But no one at Beacon House who has turned things around thinks about Ron more 
often than Terry DeKraai. The two of them used to run together, panhandle 
together, get so drunk together that life meant nothing without a bottle. 
Sobriety was tough for DeKraai, but he did it. Ron couldn't. Not even after the 
agony of having doctors shove a needle into his belly, so bloated from booze 
that the ex-Marine should have died long before he did. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the night they stuck the needle in his stomach," DeKraai says 
painfully. "I thought that would end his drinking." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't. And one foggy morning, two days after he was last seen by those who 
remember him as a charmer, the best panhandler around, Ron was found dead by 
DeKraai beneath a tree on Beacon Street where the two of them had often passed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
He was 35. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd been there for a day or two," DeKraai said. "He's gone now, but he's kept 
a lot of people sober just knowing how he died." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrick's story, the story of someone who didn't make it, is one they don't 
mind telling around Beacon House, a San Pedro recovery home for addicts and 
alcoholics. After all, they say at Beacon House, life is about failures as well 
as successes. 
</P>
<P>
And for those who don't seek help, an early death is likely. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the reality. That's what usually happens," says Beacon House Director 
Mary Proper. "And we don't want to create the false sense of security that once 
they get here, their alcoholism is taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
If Beacon House is about anything, it is about the reality of overcoming drug 
and alcohol abuse. How hard it is and how long it takes. How others can help, 
but no one can do it for you. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Beacon House opened for those who wanted to do something about their 
problem. From a ramshackle building occupied only by drunks, it has become a 
fixture in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, 70% of the estimated 2,000 men, women and teen-agers who have 
entered Beacon House have overcome their addictions, according to program and 
government officals. Referred by agencies or coming in off the streets, those 
who enter Beacon House begin with a 90-day recovery program. After that, where 
they go is up to them, though most stay at least a year, finding jobs and 
renting a room in one of the six nearby homes or apartment houses leased by 
Beacon House. 
</P>
<P>
And even for those who long ago left Beacon House, it remains a sort of 
touchstone, a place where former residents drop by for coffee or coun seling or 
conversation. A place where those who have moved away still call or send cards 
around Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a family here. You feel wanted and needed and accepted 
unconditionally," says John G., a former resident whose anonymity is in keeping 
with the rules of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was founded, Beacon House has grown from a single 20-bed recovery home 
to a nonprofit association that houses 100 adults and sometimes their children. 
With an annual budget of $500,000, derived from government grants, donations 
and activities like a thrift store, Beacon House not only provides a safe 
environment for those needing shelter, it offers counseling programs, job 
referrals and education classes. In addition, residents provide community 
services that include regular neighborhood cleanup programs. 
</P>
<P>
"They do a wonderful job there," said Joy Graham, a senior counselor for the 
state Department of Rehabilitation office in Long Beach. "From the moment a 
person comes in, they have a very planned, very supportive, very sequential way 
of helping people deal with their problem. And they really work at it." 
</P>
<P>
One measure of Beacon House's success is its selection this month by the 
department's local office as the finest community-based program in the region, 
which encompasses 19 cities and 200 programs. 
</P>
<P>
Another measure of its success is Terry DeKraai. 
</P>
<P>
"This place saved my life. I know that," DeKraai says. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, he was an All-American receiver on a USC football team that 
included O. J. Simpson. The game and the fame came easy to DeKraai. So did 
alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
"I started drinking when I was 15 years old," DeKraai says, remembering how the 
parties just seemed to be a part of the post-game celebrations. But that 
changed over time. "It got to the point where drinking after the game became 
almost more important than the game itself," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The obsession grew stronger over time. And when DeKraai's football career ended 
at age 23, after two years with the Houston Oilers, the drinking took over his 
life. "I didn't really know what to do after football was over," says DeKraai, 
who had left USC before graduating to join the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he reached Beacon House, DeKraai had been married and divorced 
twice. He'd lost every job that came along. He'd also lost hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hit bottom. I was in the gutter," he says. "I kind of thought it was my 
lot in life to live that way." 
</P>
<P>
Three years after his arrival, DeKraai is now one of the Beacon House success 
stories. He stopped drinking, went back to college and earned a degree in 
recreational therapy, hoping to work with the emotionally or physically 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Like all those who have gone through Beacon House, DeKraai learned what it's 
like to stay sober and accept responsibility. "Fighting this," he says of his 
drinking, "was the hardest thing I've ever had to do." 
</P>
<P>
Doing it, DeKraai adds, would never have been possible without the support of 
others at Beacon House, both staff and residents. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes a program work is not necessarily the dollars, but the commitment," 
says Paula Sawyer, district administrator for the state Department of 
Rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"That is what creates success, particularly in the area of substance abuse. 
What Beacon House represents is one of those programs that works." 
</P>
<P>
What makes Beacon House work? 
</P>
<P>
"It's caring," says Mike Dowling, the impish program director of Beacon House 
who's been there since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1970, a plain-talking Episcopal priest, Arthur Bartlett, grew tired of 
watching drunken sailors gather night after night in the park across the street 
from the Seamen's Church Institute on Beacon Street. 
</P>
<P>
Bartlett, who was then the institute's director, knew Beacon Street. He'd 
pretty much grown up on the docks, delivering newspapers as a boy in the 1920s. 
He remembered how it had once been dubbed "the toughest street in the world" by 
Ripley's Believe it or Not. It was a street of rowdy sailors and rough bars 
like Shanghai Red's, now gone. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Beacon Street grew tamer. But the alcoholics still gathered 
every night in what they call Wino Park. And Bartlett, desperate for some 
solution, started talking to recovered alcoholics. One of them was Dowling, a 
crusty former merchant seaman from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him asking me, 'What does a drunk need in this town?' " Dowling 
said last week. "And I told him there were a lot of loners around, a lot of 
guys who had nowhere to go but their hotel rooms. And I said if there was only 
a place they could be together to deal with their drinking." 
</P>
<P>
Several days later, they found that place -- a run-down old house at 1003 
Beacon St. The house was vacant, save for the drunks who would come in from 
time to time looking for a place to sleep. The rent was $126 a month, and 
Bartlett didn't hesitate to pay it. 
</P>
<P>
Since its founding, Beacon House has seen it all. Children have been born 
there. Couples have married there. People have died there. 
</P>
<P>
People like Mary K., a 64-year-old recovered alcoholic who moved to Beacon 
House three months before she died from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Mary K. was watched around-the-clock by the residents at Beacon House. The 
vigil was a logical extension of the way they look out for each other every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when I first got here, I came to the back door and said I needed 
help. And four guys came out to talk to me," remembers Patrick B. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Patrick was just a short walk from his mother's home. But he 
couldn't go there because his mother, hopelessly frustrated by her son's 
alcoholism, had gotten a court order to keep him away. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the guys I couldn't go home. So they wrote me a note to give her," 
recalls Patrick. He returned the next day and has been sober for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The great thing here is that the residents are so involved in every aspect of 
what goes on. They practically run Beacon House," says director Proper, who 
came to the facility in 1985 and heads a staff of five people. 
</P>
<P>
From the shopping to the cooking to the cleaning, the residents are responsible 
for Beacon House, Proper says. And those chores are never an excuse for 
residents to miss other requirements for staying at Beacon House: counseling 
meetings five days a week, book groups, alcohol education programs, community 
cleanup activities, even working one day a month at the Beacon House thrift 
store. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone comes here to ask for help, which happens all the time, the 
residents do it. We don't do it," Proper says. "They find out how to help 
someone else, and by doing that, it helps them." 
</P>
<P>
The approach sounds simple enough, and Proper is among those who believe there 
is nothing mysterious about Beacon House's success. 
</P>
<P>
"This can happen anyplace. I truly believe that," she says. "I think there are 
a lot of places that do this and a lot more that could." 
</P>
<P>
Dowling says: "It's not like Beacon House has found something totally unique. 
Yet there is something special about it. And if I had to use a word, I guess it 
would be the love," Adds Bartlett: "In church parlance, we'd call it the Holy 
Spirit. But you can just call it magic."

The San Jose health department has closed a nursing home after a five-month 
surveillance revealed serious deficiencies in the treatment of 62 elderly 
patients, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Framiglio, district administrator for the health department, said she 
recommended closing the 160-bed Evergreen Healthcare after receiving calls from 
vendors who said they would no longer provide services to the home. Framiglio 
said changes in patients' conditions were not reported to doctors, errors 
occurred in giving patients medicine and records lacked proper documentation. 
She said her staff had issued 21 citations -- seven for serious deficiencies -- 
during Evergreen Healthcare's first year of operation. Officials have placed 40 
Evergreen residents and were still trying to locate the relatives of the 
others.

Members of the gay community are urging city leaders to rename the downtown 
Civic Center's Lech Walesa Street because of an anti-homosexual statement the 
Polish Solidarity leader allegedly made this spring. Walesa, who won the Nobel 
Peace Prize in 1982, is accused of telling delegates to an April Solidarity 
union convention that he would "eliminate" homosexuals from Polish society if 
he were elected president. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged remarks caused an uproar in the city's gay community which recently 
persuaded Supervisor Harry Britt, who is gay, to schedule a hearing on the 
renaming proposal. Britt has contacted the Polish Embassy in an effort to get a 
copy of the text of Walesa's speech. The issue will be discussed Aug. 7 by the 
board's City Service Committee. Ivy Street was renamed Lech Walesa Street in 
1986 in honor of the Polish union leader's battle for democracy.

A 15-year-old youth, who police say killed a friend so he could take the 
victim's telephone pager, has been sentenced to spend a decade in the 
California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile Court Judge John Minney, in handing down the sentence Friday, said the 
authority is the only appropriate place for Manuel Walker, who the judge said 
has a history of violence. "The minor engaged in a brutal, cowardly killing 
involving an apparently defenseless victim," Minney said. "It appears he has no 
sense of accountability or responsibility for what he's done." Walker, who 
turns 16 next month, was convicted of first-degree murder for the fatal 
stabbing of 15-year-old Ricky Martinelli last March. Authorities said Walker 
can be held until age 25.

<P>
CELESTE MERGENS, AN EL CAJON HOUSEWIFE, LEADS THE CHARGE OF A BURGEONING 
GRASS-ROOTS ANTI-TAX MOVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Celeste Mergens, a polite, soft-spoken woman who is still a little 
uncomfortable in her new role as tax revolt leader, found inspiration in an 
unlikely source. 
</P>
<P>
The Duke on late-night television. 
</P>
<P>
In an old war movie, John Wayne tells a frightened comrade on the eve of battle 
that all battles are won by scared men who would rather be someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, yeah, that's right. That's just like me," Mergens said. "I was 
nervous, but I knew I had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
We the People, an anti-tax citizens group that opposes new federal taxes and 
calls for more efficient use of existing tax revenue, was born out of this El 
Cajon homemaker's financial frustration; she was fed up with the government 
swallowing a bigger and bigger chunk of her husband's paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept waiting for someone to get elected to do something to stop these 
taxes," Mergens said. "But I finally realized it would happen only if people 
got involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Our message is either return to ethical government, or we're going to vote 
these politicians out of office." 
</P>
<P>
Her new calling has stepped up the tempo in what was an already busy and 
crowded home. 
</P>
<P>
The phone rings. Her 6-year-old drips homemade clay on the rug. The 5-year-old 
climbs the furniture. The 4-year-old makes enough popcorn for an army. The 
2-year-old spits up oversalted popcorn. The baby needs nursing. The dog climbs 
on the sofa. The doorbell rings. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of this perpetual motion is Mergens, a 28-year-old mother of five 
who has found time to organize the burgeoning tax-revolt movement of 
self-described middle- and lower-class "patriots." 
</P>
<P>
Also known as PATRIOT -- People Against Taxes Revolt in Our Time -- the group 
staged its first demonstration July 12 at San Diego Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters condemned President Bush for recently suggesting a need for more 
taxes and criticized Congress for what it called inefficient use of existing 
tax money and for relying on special-interest groups for reelection campaign 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
"I assumed Bush was on our side," Mergens said. "He should have said: 'Read my 
lips. I lied.' And Congress should use what money it has and cut the waste. 
They have so many obligations to the special-interest groups that they've 
stopped representing the people as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
An area resident since 1980, Mergens has no experience in political activism. 
She has rarely participated in community projects. Once, when living in San 
Ysidro, she and some friends painted a few rundown, graffiti-covered buildings 
that were an eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
She married her husband, Donald, a property manager with a development company, 
in 1982 and has been busy rearing their children since then in a two-story 
house in the hills above El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
After writing to her legislators and getting virtually no response, Mergens 
decided to become an activist. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked my congressmen to use innovation and courage to find solutions to the 
budget deficit," she said. "We just got tired of all the taxes -- 48% of our 
income goes to taxes -- and with insurance and all the other costs of raising a 
family, we're just getting by." 
</P>
<P>
We the People plans to set up tax-protest demonstrations this summer in major 
cities across the nation, encourage voter registration and target for defeat 
those politicians who support new taxes and rely heavily on special-interest 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The group's next protest is scheduled for Thursday at the Embarcadero, near the 
County Administration Center, the site of the first demonstration. That was a 
symbolic re-enactment of the Boston Tea Party that culminated with Mergens 
throwing a handful of tea into the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Mergens said a wildlife official warned her that dumping tea into the ocean was 
a violation of state and federal laws and that she risked being arrested or 
fined. But she said the issue was too important to back down. 
</P>
<P>
For the Thursday protest, police will put a few extra officers in the area, but 
no problems are expected, said Police Department spokesman Dave Cohen. There 
was one arrest at the first demonstration -- a man who refused to relinquish 
his sign, which police said was mounted on a stick that was too large. The man 
later apologized. 
</P>
<P>
"Every indication is that this group will be law-abiding," Cohen said. "They're 
engaged in free speech, and that's what this country is all about. The only 
problem might be some traffic congestion." 
</P>
<P>
The group has focused its spotlight on federal and state taxes rather than 
local government. San Diego County government spokesman Bob Lerner said county 
officials are aware of the group but have not been contacted regarding the 
efficiency of county spending. 
</P>
<P>
We the People's sudden popularity is largely attributable to publicity from 
radio talk-show host and former Mayor Roger Hedgecock, whose support Mergens 
enlisted from the start. Using the airwaves, Mergens is encouraging a growing 
number of couch-potato tax haters to join the movement. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd estimate at the first demonstration varied from 1,000 to 3,400, but 
there was no doubt about the anger among the diverse group. More than 400 
people have volunteered their services -- from printing flyers to making phone 
calls -- and the list grows every day, Mergens said. 
</P>
<P>
Some volunteers said Mergens was the reason they attended the protest. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt it was time to get involved. I thought, by golly, if a mother of 
five kids can take the time, then so can I," said Ron Shane, an El Cajon 
contractor who dressed as Paul Revere at the July 12 demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Added Lee King, 73, a retired legal secretary: "I've been unhappy about all 
these taxes for a long, long time. My son-in-law loses half his pay to taxes." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Jim Bate (D-San Diego) said he was not aware of We the People's 
existence, but said he supports any citizens group that speaks its mind. Bates 
advised such groups to narrow their goals -- such as targeting a specific 
politician for defeat -- to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're condemning all of Congress, then they will probably be 
ineffective," Bates said. "They need to target their message if they're going 
to accomplish anything." 
</P>
<P>
Mergens said We the People is nonpartisan and accepts no donations, and she 
says she takes no money and has no aspirations for political office. 
</P>
<P>
"Be in at the beginning of a major movement that will certainly swell to 
national proportions," declares a flyer put out by Internet Associates, a small 
media-consultant firm volunteering its services. " . . . It began with Samuel 
Adams in 1773. It continues with Celeste Mergens in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Mergens laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, maybe that is a little dramatic, but we think this is just as critical a 
time," she said. "The Constitution is hanging by a thread. When the people lose 
confidence in Congress, then it is now or never."

Curators tell visitors that the Cabrillo Marine Museum got its start when a 
local lifeguard found a dead pelican washed up on the shore and plunked it 
across a table to examine. Soon he and others were collecting and displaying 
marine creatures and aquatic curiosities in a nearby bathhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, with financial help from the Los Angeles Department of 
Recreation and Parks, the museum moved into a new complex at Cabrillo Beach. 
The San Pedro museum today boasts 35 aquariums that are home to sea cucumbers, 
mantis shrimp, stony cup coral and hundreds of other animals that normally live 
in the surrounding ocean waters. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the museum is offering a series of one-week workshops for 
children, called "Science at the Seashore." During this week's workshop, kids 
in grades one to four will be collecting specimens at the seashore and 
examining them under a microscope. "Kids freak out when they can actually see 
the animals feeding," instructor Steve Vogel said. The cost is $70 for the 
five-day, 9 a.m. to noon program. 
</P>
<P>
Other special programs for adults and families are scheduled year-round. The 
museum's exhibits and aquariums are open from noon to 5 p.m. Tuesday through 
Friday and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Although admission to 
the museum at 3720 Stephen White Drive is free, parking at the lot at Cabrillo 
Beach costs $5. One of the favorite attractions at the museum is an outdoor 
tank where visitors can touch sea urchins, bat stars and sea anemones. For more 
information call 548-7562. IAN ROSE

History is murky on the burning question of who invented the telephone 
answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
But Neal Buglewicz, a former Hermosa Beach inventor and one of the founders of 
Torrance-based PhoneMate, gets a lot of credit for his pioneering efforts in 
coming up with the first marketable machine for use in the home. And although 
his name never appears in history books, the machine he was instrumental in 
developing recently became part of the Smithsonian Institution's collection of 
Americana, and it is now on display in Washington as part of a larger exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of commercial and consumer viability, it was the first" telephone 
answering machine, says Jim Oblak, PhoneMate's director of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
PhoneMate recently donated the machine to the Smithsonian after learning that 
the museum was planning an exhibit called "Information Age: People, Information 
and Technology." The exhibit opened in May and runs indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred items are part of the exhibit, from Samuel F. B. Morse's 
telegraph to the electronic bugs uncovered after the Watergate break-in; even a 
smoke detector that contained one of the bugs is displayed. 
</P>
<P>
"It basically traces the history of electrical communications from the 
telegraph in the 1840s up to the development of the electronic computers and 
the merging of these two technologies," said Bernard Finn, a curator at the 
institution's National Museum of American History. 
</P>
<P>
As for the telephone answering device in the Smithsonian, it's called the Model 
400. Its precursor was the Model 700, which Buglewicz invented. He and his wife 
assembled it themselves in their garage on Ardmore Avenue in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was essentially two inexpensive tape recorders of the type used in the 
introduction of the old 'Mission Impossible' TV series, whereby Peter Graves 
was given his instructions," Buglewicz said in a letter he faxed from 
Singapore, where he now lives. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '60s, Buglewicz and some friends formed a company, Tron Tech, to 
market the invention. The company later was renamed PhoneMate. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Model 400 -- the one in the Smithsonian -- it was introduced in 
1971, according to PhoneMate. Big and bulky by today's standards -- it weighed 
10 pounds -- it was the first machine widely marketable to consumers, according 
to the company. 
</P>
<P>
Buglewicz long ago left PhoneMate, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Japan's 
Asahi Corp., and he recently attempted to launch another telephone answering 
machine company in Singapore. However, he said his money -- and luck -- ran 
out, and he has been "goose farming" ever since. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, he is looking for another golden egg. Tim Waters

How the mayor's pet project eventually became 'Fido Fountain.' 
</P>
<P>
Local government can be frustrating, and few practitioners of the municipal art 
know that better than Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, Geissert spends hours at council meetings listening to angry 
residents berating each other about hillside view obstructions, the roar of 
airplanes or the "Taj Mahal" being built next to someone's basic three-bedroom, 
three-bath tract home. 
</P>
<P>
Among municipal issues, few are more volatile than those involving dogs, whose 
masters take to howling at the slightest hint of further regulation of their 
beloved pets. 
</P>
<P>
But when Dorothy King wrote Torrance City Hall about a canine problem on the 
beach, Geissert saw a chance to get something accomplished -- quickly, cheaply 
and, most unusually, without raising anyone's hackles. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance resident King and her dog take a daily four-mile stroll along the 
beach. Afterward, they sit in Miramar Park, overlooking the ocean. The park has 
a single water fountain. 
</P>
<P>
"People . . . are letting their dogs drink out of this fountain," King 
complained April 6. "The large dogs jump up as their masters turn on the water 
for them. Very upsetting to me, and others, if they knew they were drinking 
after dogs. I myself love my dog . . . but I do not eat or drink after my own 
dog." 
</P>
<P>
King suggested that the city put in a water fountain at the base of the 
existing fountain. "Something must be done . . . to keep the city of Torrance 
clean health-wise," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Geissert agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"That sounded reasonable to me," the mayor said. "There are not many 
opportunities to serve people that don't cost much money. In rather short 
order, they put in a ground-level basin." 
</P>
<P>
And there, you might think, the tale would end. 
</P>
<P>
Thirsty dogs watered, sensibilities preserved. Problem solved. 
</P>
<P>
But back at the park, beach-goers just did not understand. 
</P>
<P>
King wrote again. "Some people do not use their head. . . . Some people are 
using the dog fountain to wash their feet, and the sand is stopping up the 
drain. 
</P>
<P>
"Dog lovers," she added, "are talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
And that is how the city of Torrance came to erect a miniature headstone at its 
canine watering spot, "Fido Fountain." 
</P>
<P>
Geissert thinks it may be some sort of first. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there is another Fido Fountain around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On July 22, the ever-observant King again wrote: "I have seen many people stop, 
read this sign, walk away with a smile on their face. . . . I am truly 
grateful." George Stein

HIGH-SPEED TRAIN FROM O.C. TO VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to recent news articles, plans are in progress to build a privately 
funded super-train between Las Vegas and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that the major reason for this $5-billion expenditure is to more 
easily transport California dollars to Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Why not use this money to build a casino complex of our own here in California 
and keep all those gambling dollars at home? Think of the revenue available for 
the government from such an operation! 
</P>
<P>
We already have poker and the state lottery, so why not go all the way? We 
could probably outdo Atlantic City, Reno and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
A super-train sounds nice, but if it's such a good investment, how come the 
proponents are already talking about a subsidy? 
</P>
<P>
Apparently they not only want to transport California dollars to Nevada, they 
want the taxpayers to help pay for it!

This letter is from an irate reader regarding the article on John Bradshaw's 
four-day seminars in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
I attended all four sessions with the result being increased understanding that 
enables me to be a more relaxed, efficient and happy person. 
</P>
<P>
I find the biased and erroneous reporting in The Times offensive and demeaning. 
</P>
<P>
At the very beginning, the uninformed reader would assume many people were 
there with stuffed animals. There were only two during the entire four days. 
</P>
<P>
John Bradshaw is not a guru; he provides a very effective therapy that helps 
people to think and feel for themselves. If they need assistance after his 
lectures, they are encouraged to obtain it from their individual therapists, 
and many well-known and respected therapists refer their patients to John 
Bradshaw lectures. 
</P>
<P>
The music was not New Age. Of the wide variety of tapes for sale, only one had 
the name New Age on it, and to my knowledge, it was not used for background 
music. New Age is considered to be demonic by many people. The headline word 
"Exorcise" implies evil spirits. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, the falsity of these words gives the readers a tremendous 
misconception that harms the useful work that Bradshaw does. 
</P>
<P>
We were not "huddled" in groups. A more appropriate description would be 
"gathered in supportive groups." "Secrets" were not "confessed;" they were 
shared, more often involving childhood hurts than criminal acts. People were 
comforted and gained insight from others in the groups. 
</P>
<P>
If Bradshaw's therapy on healing the inner child had been available 40 years 
ago, I would have avoided much suffering and saved a big bunch of money.

I enjoyed your article ("Menninger Dies: Changed U.S. View of Mental Illness," 
July 20) reviewing the contributions made to our society by Karl Menninger. 
</P>
<P>
I am so sorry you didn't send this reporter to listen to John Bradshaw last 
week. Who knows? Bradshaw may be today's Karl Menninger. Bradshaw also is 
"delving into his patients' early life experiences . . . " and involving "the 
patient's family . . . " believing that problems are preventable and treatable.

Re "Family-Therapy Participants Try to Shed Childhood Anguish" (July 14): I 
would like to offer another viewpoint concerning John Bradshaw and the 
workshops he gives. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, I participated in one of John Bradshaw's inner child workshops. 
Already 18 years into a recovery process from childhood trauma, which included 
incest, alcoholic parents and severe physical and emotional abuse, there was 
still a missing puzzle piece. 
</P>
<P>
A few years before John's workshop, I had begun to search for my inner child. I 
longed to make contact with the little girl with blond hair and blue eyes in 
the picture I carried in my wallet. While still quite small she had learned 
that the adults in her life couldn't be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
My attempts to make contact were barred by her well-founded suspicions and 
doubts. Even though the adult me had healed in great measure, that part of me 
still longed for a healthy parent. Since this was not really possible from the 
outside, I would need to learn how to accomplish the process on the inside, to 
become my own healthy parent. 
</P>
<P>
During John's workshop I made contact with the child I had been. After several 
eye-opening processes, we came to a meditation near the end of the workshop. 
There I encountered myself as a little 5-year-old with beautiful but sad blue 
eyes standing on the front porch of our family home. 
</P>
<P>
In her arms was a favorite doll. I imagined walking up to her and asking her to 
come with me, telling her that I would protect and love her. After staring at 
me for several seconds she took one last look at the place that had been home, 
then bravely extended her tiny hand to me and together we walked away from all 
the pain. 
</P>
<P>
From that moment, I began to provide the wounded child of my past the healthy 
parent that she/I had never had. 
</P>
<P>
John Bradshaw's workshops are not a "magic button" for healing because there is 
no magic button, as John would be the first to confirm. For me, however, as 
part of a comprehensive healing process, this experience was one of the most 
powerful.

<TEXT>
<P>
A pedestrian, possibly an undocumented immigrant, was run down by at least one 
hit-and-run vehicle and killed late Friday along Interstate 5 near the 
U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
He was struck in a zone where dozens of undocumented pedestrians have been 
killed in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
A network of high-speed roadways forms a barrier for those who have made 
unauthorized crossings into San Diego from Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
State authorities have placed flashing signs in the area, warning motorists of 
people crossing the road unexpectedly, but the fatalities continue to mount. 
</P>
<P>
The latest victim was identified only as Jose Toribo Barrales. His age and 
address were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred shortly before 10 p.m., at a spot along I-5 just north of 
the California 905 intersection. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol was investigating.

THE CANYON'S FATE: LEAVE IT TO THE VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations on your editorial "The Canyon's Fate Is Up to the Voters" (July 
8). 
</P>
<P>
I could not agree more with your conclusion that "it all comes down to money." 
</P>
<P>
I sincerely hope the residents of Laguna Beach can learn a lesson from San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, the residents of San Juan Capistrano gave the rest of Orange 
County a (somewhat overlooked) lesson this past April 10. By an overwhelming 
majority (71%), our residents voted to tax themselves to acquire approximately 
140 acres of open space and farmland. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because they wanted to preserve a certain, quantifiable quality of life, 
prevent the development of these areas and create play fields and a community 
center for both present and future generations. It would have been easy to vote 
"no." It took vision, courage and a true sense of community to say "yes." 
</P>
<P>
We do not live in a world where "someone else" will solve our problems. The 
federal, state and county governments do not have the money. 
</P>
<P>
We have all chosen to live in a very popular area of the world. That choice has 
also brought public responsibilities along with our jobs, homes and wonderful 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
One of these burdens is to collectively invest in the future of Orange County 
and, from time to time, in our own communities.

LAGUNA NIGUEL LAND GIVEAWAY: FINDING CULPRITS IN LOST SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Krembas of Laguna Niguel is not a bad fellow. I almost voted for him. The 
fact that he signed away the Salt Creek Park to developers is not his fault. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't do it deliberately, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he claims that he read it but didn't understand what he was signing. 
(That's the kind of man we want running our local government. He's honest!) 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he couldn't read it properly because he's near-sighted, which is not his 
fault, or maybe he didn't understand it because it was written in legalese 
which nobody understands (except lawyers and they don't tell, claiming 
privilege like a priest). So we can't blame him for not being up on legalese 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps he felt that Laguna Niguel had enough parks, and parks could cause 
fathers and mothers to bring their children and waste time when they should be 
working and being productive. (It's far-fetched, but it's an argument.) 
</P>
<P>
Jim Krembas says there was no relation between his actions as a public official 
and his wife's employment with the builders, Taylor Woodrow Homes. I believe 
him. I don't think his wife is related to Taylor Woodrow Homes. Now, I want to 
ask, if someone you did a little favor for approaches your wife and offers her 
a good job, would you make her stay home and bake cookies? 
</P>
<P>
So let's hear it for Jim Krembas!

LAGUNA NIGUEL LAND GIVEAWAY: FINDING CULPRITS IN LOST SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the issue of the missing 96 acres of parkland, all of South Orange County 
mourns this permanent loss. 
</P>
<P>
It is evident that the relationship between South Laguna and Laguna Niguel is 
being rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
The leadership of the City Council -- from voiding the "wild" deed that allowed 
this parkland to be lost to enacting a moratorium protecting its remainder -- 
clearly exhibited that the Laguna Niguel City Council is a government body 
concerned with acting to protect the values and interests we all share.

LAGUNA NIGUEL LAND GIVEAWAY: FINDING CULPRITS IN LOST SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We are writing to express our support of the strong action taken by the Laguna 
Niguel City Council July 17, with regard to the giving away of 96 acres of 
public parkland to developer Taylor Woodrow. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Patricia Bates has set the right standard in declaring the City Council's 
determination to protect the public's property and rights. Councilman James F. 
Krembas and all other city and county officials are public servants who must 
honor the trust that has been placed in them. 
</P>
<P>
Too often in the last 15 years, citizens have felt that county government is 
largely in the service of developers who seek to exploit communities and 
destroy the landscape for corporate and personal profit. 
</P>
<P>
Communities such as Laguna Beach, which have actively sought to protect their 
environmental heritage and remain good places to live, are accused of being 
exclusive and shutting the door to others. 
</P>
<P>
Developers seek to present themselves as serving the interests of the people by 
building as many houses as possible. They act as though it is outrageous and 
unfair for a community to try to protect itself from their profiteering and 
destruction of precious natural resources. And never mind that they take their 
profits and live elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
How did 96 acres of public parkland come to be lost? Since Laguna Niguel is a 
new city without its own planning staff, it has been under contract with county 
government to provide the proper protection for local land-use. The present 
situation again brings to light the grave concern that for many years county 
officials have not been adequately protecting our communities. They have 
instead pursued a high-growth policy without regard for the extreme density and 
traffic problems that would result. 
</P>
<P>
A good example of county insensitivity to land-use can be seen in the large 
portion of the Binion hillside and ridgeline above South Laguna which was left 
under county control (now part of Laguna Niguel) when South Laguna was annexed 
to the city of Laguna Beach, deliberately creating problems that can only be 
solved by large expenditures on the part of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel became a city to prevent violations of the public trust regarding 
land-use. Many communities are seeking to incorporate for similar reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal disposal of public parkland causes us to wonder what other 
improprieties may have occurred under county control. In the past we have 
condemned the high-growth policies so rigorously pursued by the county. 
</P>
<P>
Now we must question the very integrity of documents signed by county 
officials. If Councilman Krembas did not draw up or approve the document which 
bears his signature, who did?

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : PACIFIC BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The manager of a Pacific Beach fast-food restaurant was in fair condition 
Saturday after having been kidnaped, robbed and shot by two thieves who whisked 
him off a San Diego street and forced him to go with them in a car to Jamul, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, who accosted the victim on a Pacific Beach street at 10:30 a.m, 
drove him 25 miles southeast to Jamul, where he was shot but managed to escape, 
said Bill Robinson, a San Diego police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, manager of the Denny's restaurant on Garnet Avenue in Pacific 
Beach, was identified only as Bob Lipske. He is in his mid-30s, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Many details of the case -- including the reason why Lipske was shot and how he 
escaped his captors -- are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Lipske was shot in the abdomen, the spokesman said. The wound was not 
considered critical, although Lipske was expected to spend at least one night 
at Sharp Memorial Hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Once free in Jamul, Robinson said, Lipske staggered to a fire station, where 
authorities were notified. He was airlifted to Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Lipske was robbed of $5,800, the total of restaurant receipts that he was 
carrying, Robinson said. He was about to deposit them in a Pacific Beach bank 
when the two suspects approached him as he walked along Garnet Avenue and 
forced him into the car, which was parked nearby, the police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle used in the kidnaping has since been recovered, police said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police are seeking the two suspects on charges of armed robbery and 
kidnaping, both felonies. Only vague descriptions were available.

<P>
The California Highway Patrol was investigating two separate weekend accidents 
on Interstate 8 in eastern San Diego County that left two drivers dead and two 
passengers injured. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, authorities said, the vehicles were westbound and veered off the 
road for undetermined reasons. 
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, a driver lost control of his pickup truck in the Jacumba 
area at 10:15 p.m. Friday and the vehicle went down an embankment. Dead at the 
scene was Reid Charles Anderson, 37, of Chandler, Ariz. His son, Timothy, 7, 
was also injured but expected to recover, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second incident, a driver lost control of his car at the Crestwood Road 
undercrossing and struck a guardrail. The dead man was identified as Jesus 
Manuel Martinez Lopez of Indio. An unidentified passenger was also hurt but his 
injuries were not life-threatening, authorities said.

2 CAMP PENDLETON MARINES KILLED IN DESERT COPTER CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. military investigators were combing a crash scene in Imperial County's 
rugged Chocolate Mountains Saturday to determine why a Marine Corps helicopter 
based at Camp Pendleton went down late Friday, killing the pilot and co-pilot 
and injuring three other crewmen. 
</P>
<P>
The crash of the UH-1N Huey aircraft occurred at 9:25 p.m. Friday during a 
routine training mission, said Gunnery Sgt. Hal Wheeler, a corps spokesman in 
Yuma. There were no storms at the time and weather did not appear to be a 
factor in the desert crash, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
The mishap occurred in an unpopulated, fenced-off area that is a designated 
military bombing range, Wheeler said. An accompanying Marine helicopter 
witnessed the incident and called for assistance, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
The downed aircraft was carrying practice rockets and small-caliber ammunition 
when it went down at a site about 55 miles northwest of Yuma, just east of the 
Salton Sea, in the southwestern corner of California, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The fliers were not wearing night-vision goggles, but Wheeler said that would 
not be unusual, even on evening flights. 
</P>
<P>
The dead men were identified as Maj. Bob Maguire, the pilot, and First Lt. Tony 
Stancil, the co-pilot. Their ages and hometowns were not available. 
</P>
<P>
All three crewmen, who were airlifted out of the crash site, were listed in 
stable condition at Yuma Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter and its crew were part of the Medium Light Attack Helicopter 
Squadron-367, which is based at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The squadron has been on a routine training mission at the Marine Corps Air 
Station Yuma since July 20, the marine spokesman said. The Yuma deployment was 
scheduled to last through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the wounded men were identified only as First Lt. Herb Moran and Sgt. 
Michael Becker. The identity of the third crewman was withheld pending 
notification of relatives. The ages and hometowns of the injured men were also 
not available.

SEWAGE LEAK INTO PICO-KENTER DRAIN IS FIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A break in an aging sewer line beneath a Santa Monica street sent hundreds of 
thousands of gallons of raw sewage flowing down the Pico-Kenter storm drain 
toward Santa Monica Bay before the leak was fixed last week. 
</P>
<P>
The leak in a 15-inch sewer line at 20th Street and Colorado Avenue was 
discovered Tuesday as city workers searched for the source of sewage 
contamination that showed up in tests taken in the storm drain last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica General Services Director Stan Scholl estimated that at its peak, 
120 to 150 gallons of sewage per minute flowed from the sewer line through a 
nearby collector pipe into the storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that this has been leaking for at least four weeks," Scholl said in 
an interview Thursday. "During that time, there's been several hundred thousand 
gallons that has leaked into the storm drain." 
</P>
<P>
Once the break was discovered, Santa Monica officials dispatched crews to the 
end of the drain at the foot of Pico Boulevard in a last-ditch effort to stop 
the sewage from entering the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline-powered pumps on the beachfront bicycle trail worked around the clock 
for much of last week to pull all water out of the storm drain and deposit it 
in a nearby sewer line. 
</P>
<P>
Scholl said repairs to the 50-year-old sewer line, which serves businesses and 
residences, were expected to cost between $20,000 and $30,000. The break was 
the second in a dozen years in that section of sewer line, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The leak added yet another chapter to the long and troubled history of the 
Pico-Kenter drain, which carries storm water runoff from Brentwood, much of 
Santa Monica and part of West Los Angeles to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica officials late last month posted signs on the beach prohibiting 
bathing within 100 yards of the drain after it was disclosed that extensive 
tests last summer had shown that the runoff was contaminated with human enteric 
viruses from sewage. 
</P>
<P>
The viruses can cause illness ranging from stomach flu to hepatitis. The signs 
say, in English and Spanish, that the storm drain water "may be contaminated 
with human disease-causing bacteria and virus or hazardous chemicals washed 
down from urban areas." 
</P>
<P>
The test results were compiled and released by the Santa Monica Bay Restoration 
Project, a joint public-private partnership funded by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency and the State Water Resources Control Board. Researchers 
speculated that the sewage was coming from leaking sewer lines or the local 
homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
In searching for the source of the original problem, city workers encountered 
high bacteria counts as they moved upstream from the mouth of the drain. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of one recreational vehicle was caught dumping the vehicle's holding 
tanks into the drain and will be prosecuted, Scholl said. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials say the broken sewer line may have been the major source of 
the sewage problem in the drain. Scholl speculated that the leak had been 
gradually increasing over time. But he said it is unknown whether the break 
contributed to the presence of human viruses in the drain last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Gold, staff scientist for the environmental group Heal the Bay, said there 
is no way to prove that the recent sewer line break was related to the 
contamination in the storm drain 11 months ago. "I don't think anyone can say 
one way or another," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Gold said, a new round of viral testing should be conducted after the 
drain is cleared out. 
</P>
<P>
As the beachfront pumping continued at midweek, environmentalists and county 
health officials clashed over whether other storm drains that flow into the bay 
year-round should be posted with warning signs. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, representing the Department of Health Services, the 
Department of Beaches and Harbors and the County Sanitation Districts, all 
argued against the warning signs, while environmentalists favored them. 
</P>
<P>
The debate Wednesday at a meeting of the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project 
demonstrated once again the depth of disagreement among various interests about 
the potential health effects of storm drain runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Petralia, director of the Department of Health Services' Bureau of 
Environmental Protection, argued that the county cannot post warning signs in 
the absence of a documented health risk. 
</P>
<P>
He said samples taken at chest depth in the surf near the Pico-Kenter drain 
show "there is no health risk that we can identify." 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists argued that the contents of the runoff alone and the fact 
that children often play on the beach near the drains should be enough to 
require warning signs. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Gladstein, legislative aide to Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), 
said the county takes the wrong approach by insisting on hard evidence of a 
health threat. 
</P>
<P>
Gladstein said the storm drains carry "God knows what from the streets of Los 
Angeles. We simply don't have to wait until the money is appropriated for 
epidemiological studies . . . to begin warning the public." 
</P>
<P>
He suggested a skull-and-crossbones sign. Others recommended the international 
symbol for no swimming. The county opposed any signs. 
</P>
<P>
After more than an hour of debate, members of the restoration project voted to 
urge that warning signs be posted on the 10 drains between Malibu and Redondo 
Beach that flow all year. But project members could not agree on the wording 
and left that decision to a committee.

RENT CONTROL AT A CROSSROADS IN SANTA MONICA; 
</P>
<P>
NEWS ANALYSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blame it on the lure of the ocean breezes and speculators capitalizing on the 
condo craze. 
</P>
<P>
Berate the Ellis Act as the scourge of rent control in Santa Monica. Or bless 
it as a triumph over tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
Point to the apartment around the corner that hasn't been painted since 
"harvest gold" was a trendy color, with rents as outdated as the decor. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how you spin it, the bottom line reads the same: Santa Monica's rent 
control law is at a perilous crossroads. And a group of its staunchest 
supporters is trying to save it by giving landlords a little of what they want 
-- more leeway to raise rents. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights majority on the City Council is 
preparing a November ballot measure that would allow limited rent increases 
when units are voluntarily vacated, a surprising shift in strategy. 
</P>
<P>
For rent control purists, vacancy decontrol has long been viewed as sacrilege, 
and the council members are being accused of selling out to save their 
political hides. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Packer Davis, chairman of the Santa Monica Rent Control Board, said 
council members are "worried and scared." 
</P>
<P>
She added: "It says to me that the (Renters' Rights) organization is not what 
it used to be and does not represent the best interests of tenants in this 
city." 
</P>
<P>
There is no mystery why the organization is backing a measure to dilute what is 
usually called the nation's toughest rent control law, even if Mayor Dennis 
Zane prefers to talk of "liberalizing" rent control, not watering it down. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights wants to defeat the more sweeping decontrol 
proposed by landlords, and its private poll indicates that the group can 
succeed with a less onerous measure, Zane said. 
</P>
<P>
If only the landlords' measure were on the ballot, he said, the fight to defeat 
it would be tougher. That measure, qualified by a petition drive, allows rent 
on vacated apartments to rise to market levels. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman David Finkel agreed. "Rent control is an experiment," he said. 
"What we're really doing is rethinking rent control. . . . I really think a 
fair degree of people will think a change is in order." 
</P>
<P>
That is because, Finkel said, some rents were frozen 11 years ago at a 
lower-than-market rate, and it is fair to adjust them upward. 
</P>
<P>
While Zane would not release the poll's findings, Rent Control Board member 
Wayne Bauer said more than half of the people polled want rent control changed. 
The unanswered question is how. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council continued to tinker with the wording of the ballot measure 
last Wednesday at a continuation of its Tuesday night meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Council members made the measure even more desirable for property owners by 
dropping a requirement that landlords promise not to go out of business for 10 
years. Instead, landlords would have to agree to a three-year tenancy to take 
advantage of rent decontrol. A final vote on the ballot measure is set for Aug. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
As for the landlords, they finally see an opening because tenants have 
something to fear more than a rent increase: the threat that the landlords will 
invoke their rights under the state Ellis Act and go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Apartment owner Al Kindt said the landlords' strategy is to convince fearful 
tenants they will not be harmed by vacancy decontrol, which won't affect them 
-- or their rent -- as long as they stay put. The larger threat to tenants is 
the Ellis Act, which could put them out on the street in a city where finding a 
vacant rent-controlled apartment isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
Landlord Chester Hoover said nothing less than total vacancy decontrol will 
stem the tide of apartment owners going out of the rental business because 
rents are too low to make a profit. "It's going to be Katie bar the door, and 
you heard it right here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,000 units have already gone or are going the Ellis Act route, 
with condominium speculators buying the usually small apartment buildings, then 
erecting new condominiums. Many observers, however, say the Ellis craze has 
temporarily slowed while everyone waits for the voters to speak in November. 
</P>
<P>
Zane said the driving force behind the Ellis phenomenon is the lucrative condo 
market. "The high value of the condo market in this city simply provides a 
lure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Zane and his allies on the council are hoping their decontrol measure 
will provide sufficient incentive to keep some landlords in business, that view 
is not shared by some, including City Atty. Robert Myers. "All the measures are 
bad, but operating under the Ellis Act is bad, too," Myers said at an unusual 
joint session of the Rent Control Board and City Council on July 19. 
</P>
<P>
In a later interview, Myers said: "I do not think this proposal or any of the 
proposals before the City Council will have a material effect on when someone 
uses the Ellis Act. There's no evidence" to think otherwise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Myers said he favors using land-use law to address concerns about 
overdevelopment of condominiums at the expense of low-cost housing stock. 
</P>
<P>
Davis agrees that the decontrol measures are on the wrong tack, both 
philosophically and as a strategy to halt the loss of affordable housing. "I 
believe vacancy decontrol should be fought at all costs," Davis said. "If the 
city was really serious about stopping Ellis-ing, they'd put a moratorium on 
condo development tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran council member Christine Reed, meanwhile, is watching the Renters' 
Rights camp struggle with the shifting winds of rent control and politics. "It 
all means the radical left is coming to finally understand the realities of 
housing economics," she said. "They're getting more reasonable. I think it's 
painful for all of them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It is divisive, emotional and rarely amenable to compromise. As a political 
issue, rent control is to Santa Monica what abortion is to the United States at 
large. Here are excerpts from recent interviews and debates in Santa Monica 
showing some of the range of opinions: 
</P>
<P>
"It all means that the radical left is coming to finally realize the realities 
of housing economics. They're getting more reasonable. . . . I think it's 
painful for all of them." -- Councilwoman Christine Reed 
</P>
<P>
"Something has to be done to liberalize the rent control law. . . . When the 
condo market is crazy it creates crazy dynamics. . . . The high value of the 
condo market in this city simply provides a lure." -- Santa Monica Mayor Dennis 
Zane 
</P>
<P>
"The people who voted for rent control in the first place are being sold out. 
(Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights) is not what it used to be and does not 
represent the best interests of tenants in this city. . . . If the city was 
really serious about stopping Ellis-ing, they would put a moratorium on condo 
development tomorrow." -- Rent Control Board Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis 
</P>
<P>
"What we're really doing is rethinking rent control. . . . I think a fair 
degree of people will say a change is in order. . . ." -- City Councilman David 
Finkel 
</P>
<P>
"All the measures are bad but operating under the Ellis Act is bad too. . . . I 
do not think this proposal or any of the proposals before the City Council will 
have a material effect on when someone uses the Ellis Act (to evict tenants and 
go out of the rental business)." -- Santa Monica City Atty. Robert Myers 
</P>
<P>
"If you think you can offer us less than total vacancy decontrol, you're wrong. 
. . . It's going to be Katie bar the door -- and you heard it right here." -- 
landlord Chester Hoover 
</P>
<P>
"What we're offering the people is less than they have now." -- Rent Control 
Board member Wayne Bauer

HOLLYWOOD HOUSE DISPUTE MAY BE SIGN OF LANDMARK BATTLES TO COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The massive Craftsman-style house on the corner of Wilcox and Fountain avenues 
that some say was once home to Clark Gable seems to list a bit to one side. 
</P>
<P>
Its owner, Stanley Diller, says he wants to either knock it down or move it to 
another location so he can expand his Orchard Gables Convalescent Home, which 
is also on the premises. He says the building is an unsafe and ugly "old shack" 
that is getting in the way of progress and profit. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a catch: Some Hollywood preservation advocates want the house 
renovated and protected as a city landmark, as does the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency as part of its $922-million effort to redevelop Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, according to CRA officials, Diller and his co-owners of the 
property at 1277 Wilcox Ave. accepted a low-interest $350,000 CRA loan in 1986 
to renovate and expand the convalescent home and provide more beds for 
low-income elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
Contending that the promised work was never done, the CRA is now threatening to 
foreclose on the 55,000-square-foot property, including the old building and 
the convalescent home behind it. 
</P>
<P>
More broadly, the conflict over Orchard Gables raises questions that those 
planning the rebirth of Hollywood expect to recur frequently as the 30-year 
revitalization effort unfolds: How should the city balance its efforts to 
preserve buildings of only marginal historical or architectural significance 
with its efforts to make sure those buildings meet safety and earthquake 
standards? And what rights do property owners retain, particularly those who 
cannot afford city-mandated repairs? 
</P>
<P>
The controversy came to light last week when Doug Carlton, leader of the 
preservation group Keep Old Los Angeles, called reporters to the site to 
publicize his offer to buy the house from Diller for $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Any house built in the Craftsman-style right in Hollywood should be saved," 
Carlton said. "We don't need a redeveloped Hollywood; we need a restored 
Hollywood. Hollywood belongs to everyone in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Diller refused, saying, "We would like to have this knocked down to build more 
homes for the elderly. We have the (city) approvals right now." 
</P>
<P>
As the cameras rolled, a CRA official rushed onto the scene and reminded Diller 
he cannot demolish the 86-year-old building. Diller promptly began to complain 
about being caught in a Catch-22 situation in which the CRA won't let him touch 
the structure, but other city officials have told him it is unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
Diller said the building is unable to withstand an expansion or even continued 
use as the convalescent home's kitchen and office suites. 
</P>
<P>
"So what am I to do?" Diller asked repeatedly. "One (city) department doesn't 
know what the other department does. And I'm stuck in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
City Building and Safety Department official Bob Harder said he could not 
confirm whether his department had determined the building is unsafe, but he 
said Diller hasn't received the required demolition permit to destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
One thing all those involved have agreed upon is that it will be difficult to 
strike a balance among the conflicting forces of preservation, redevelopment 
and property-owners' rights. 
</P>
<P>
"We have anticipated this general controversy since 1986 when the redevelopment 
plan was adopted," said Councilman Michael Woo, who represents Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important for the city to distinguish between genuine landmarks 
and buildings that are simply old," Woo said. "We will have to do that on a 
case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
Cooke Sunoo, the CRA's project manager for the Hollywood Redevelopment Project, 
said thousands of buildings in Hollywood were examined for architectural or 
historic value prior to 1986. More than 1,000 -- including Orchard Gables -- 
were found to have some level of significance. That special status will raise a 
red flag when developers seek permission to demolish or change the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
But controversy inevitably will arise once city officials begin deciding 
whether to approve or reject the proposals, Sunoo said. "The problem is there 
is not an absolute scale" of what should be saved. "There's a judgment 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
According to Sunoo, Diller has been aware of his commitment to keep the 
building intact since the CRA loan was issued in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Diller insisted that he had no knowledge of the terms of the loan, 
and that, "I never signed for it -- they didn't give it to me personally." 
</P>
<P>
Documents filed with the city show, however, that a complicated web of 
partnerships and a corporation received the loans, and that Diller's signature 
is the first of four to appear on the trust deed that the partners negotiated 
with the CRA on Sept. 9, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
To receive the 7% loan, Diller and his partners promised to keep the property 
in good condition and repair it, and they agreed not to "remove or demolish any 
buildings thereon" while adding at least 50 additional beds. 
</P>
<P>
But the site still has only 42 patients, Diller acknowledged. He said he has 
spent $70,000 on plans to expand the site. 
</P>
<P>
Although the partners long ago defaulted on the loan, the CRA does not want to 
seize the property. "We have the option to foreclose," Sunoo said, "but we 
would be loath to foreclose on a convalescent home." 
</P>
<P>
The CRA and Diller are now engaged in negotiations over the site, including the 
possibility of building condominiums on the premises but keeping the house and 
a number of the convalescent beds intact. In addition, "I think we need to be 
more vigilant in finding out why that work has not taken place," Sunoo said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Woo and the city agency charged with protecting landmark buildings, the 
Cultural Heritage Commission, have not taken sides in the Orchard Gables 
dispute. Neither has Hollywood Heritage, a respected nonprofit preservationist 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Christy McAvoy, a Hollywood Heritage board member, said the building is a good 
example of the Craftsman style, an architectural style indigenous to Southern 
California that marked a move away from fancy Victorian homes at the turn of 
the century to simple wood homes combining indoor and outdoor living through 
open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
All involved in the Orchard Gables conflict expect it to be followed by similar 
clashes. In fact, a similar controversy has arisen over the Ontra Cafeteria on 
Vine Street. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, the Cultural Heritage Commission drew the wrath of a judge by 
declaring the Ontra a landmark in order to stymie its owners' efforts to tear 
it down. Declaring that the commission had abused its authority, the judge 
ordered the landmark status revoked, and the City Council declined to challenge 
his decree. 
</P>
<P>
The council's refusal to intervene means that city preservation officials in 
the future will take a more narrow view of what buildings to preserve, 
Commission President Amarjit Marwah said.

HOMELESS ACTIVISTS MOURN MISSION'S 'PAPA BEAR'

<TEXT>
<P>
It was right around Thanksgiving last year, as his friends recall, that Fred 
McCarty's cough started getting so bad that the fits left him red in the face 
and gasping violently for air. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty, whose hefty girth, white hair, beard and frequent smile gave him more 
than a passing resemblance to St. Nick, was homeless and sick. At 49, he had 
suffered two heart attacks, lost his job as a truck driver, his home, then his 
two daughters to foster parents, because the only home he could offer them was 
the back of the family station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of sliding into despair, McCarty became a quiet but determined 
spokesman for the homeless, working hard to break stereotypes that define the 
homeless as shiftless men and women. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Lynette, told their story on Comic Relief, the nationally 
televised fund-raiser for the homeless that included comedy's best talents. He 
also spoke to church groups and other organizations interested in the homeless 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
But as he became a well-known and effective spokesman for the homeless, his 
health began to fail. What was thought to be a bad smoker's hack turned into 
pneumonia, and later his symptoms were diagnosed as lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, he died after an operation to remove a cancerous tumor from his 
lung. 
</P>
<P>
Although McCarty did not make it off the streets or buy a new home for his 
children, as he had hoped, his friends said he accomplished much for the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"He saw the way homeless are and saw that they were no different from anybody 
else," said Spike Johnson, one of McCarty's friends at the Christian Outreach 
Appeal, a downtown mission where McCarty had been working as a security guard. 
"What Fred was saying is that he was equal. He gave me the chance to show who I 
really was." 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Cromer, who had been living in the brush near the Los Angeles River 
until he met McCarty about four months ago, said McCarty was the "papa bear" of 
the mission. 
</P>
<P>
"He was someone you could sit down and talk to, tell all your problems to," 
Cromer said. "He would take care of everybody. I got my life together because 
of Fred." 
</P>
<P>
Others at Christian Outreach Appeal remember McCarty as a quiet man who enjoyed 
a good joke and a frequent smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The normally easygoing man had a stubborn streak when it came to cutting down 
on cigarettes, they said, so he continued to smoke until the day he was 
admitted to the hospital. But what people remember most about McCarty was his 
generosity. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Pagnani, the city's homeless services coordinator, said: "Here he was, 
destitute himself, living in his car, but he always shared what he had with 
other people. He was an exceptional human being." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Gary Erb, the pastor at Christian Outreach Appeal, said McCarty had 
been homeless for about five years. For most of that time, he and he wife lived 
out of their station wagon, both working part time, neither making enough to 
rent an apartment. Their children were living in Victorville with foster 
parents, and McCarty and his wife spent their time traveling between the 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Erb said McCarty came to Christian Outreach Appeal last fall and was working as 
a volunteer. He and his wife were eventually hired on as staff and allowed to 
live in the mission's house with about eight others. Erb said McCarty did find 
a job servicing vending machines, but then his car broke down and McCarty lost 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
Though McCarty was eligible for disability benefits, Erb said he and his wife 
did not understand the system, so it wasn't until McCarty came to Christian 
Outreach Appeal that he filled out proper paper work. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty's friends remember that they rarely saw him depressed or discouraged by 
the bad turns his life had taken. It was a side of him that he hid, they said. 
</P>
<P>
But when he appeared on Comic Relief, he spoke of the loss of his children and 
his life as a homeless man. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing, the thing that hurts the most about being homeless is the 
fear that it is always going to continue that way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Erb said a special fund has been set up for Lynette McCarty. Christian Outreach 
Appeal is paying for McCarty's funeral. Donations to Lynette McCarty can be 
sent to her care of Christian Outreach Appeal.

SIERRA MADRE'S PLAN FOR BUSINESS DISTRICT RUNS INTO HARD REALITY

SIERRA MADRE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When fire ravaged six businesses in Sierra Madre last December, some saw the 
disaster as an opportunity to build from the ashes a dream downtown for which 
the city had hungered for years. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and architect Don Watts envisioned a large plaza stretching 
along the south side of Sierra Madre Boulevard from Baldwin Avenue to 
Renaissance Plaza, the area hit by the $721,000 fire. 
</P>
<P>
Under the dream plan, the town's premier corner would have underground parking 
for 25 cars and 12 new, retail stores to lure the city's 11,250 residents from 
nearby malls and back to hometown shops. 
</P>
<P>
But those dreams have since collided with the reality of small-town life, said 
Ron Hutson, the city's Main Street project manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything you need, from cooperation to dollars to expertise, is in shorter 
supply here than in larger communities," Hutson said. 
</P>
<P>
The result is not a totally revamped downtown, but three fairly standard 
two-story buildings totaling about 9,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, City Manager James McRea believes the new building plans, now 
being scrutinized by city planners, represent progress for Sierra Madre, which 
lags far behind other San Gabriel Valley cities in sales tax earning power. The 
city earns only about $160,000 annually in sales tax revenues -- about $16 per 
capita compared to the valley average of $50, McRea said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a solution, it's a beginning," McRea said of the development 
proposals. "I don't think it will substantially improve the tax base, but it 
will put in motion Sierra Madre's commitment to retail." 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 6 fire began when a faulty extension cord ignited paint thinner in the 
back of one of the shops. The blaze gutted buildings housing the Treasures of 
Sierra Madre gift shop, Webb &amp; Gordon Realtors, the Spinning Wheel gift 
shop and the Soft Touch Nail Salon. 
</P>
<P>
Rooftop flames also put the Tequila Sunrise gift shop out of business and 
damaged Happy's Wine &amp; Spirits. 
</P>
<P>
After the fire, town merchants rallied to aid the fire victims, raising about 
$6,000 at a sidewalk sale. Another $400 remains in an account kept by Harlequin 
Gallery, which sold photos and videos of the fire, said Frank Van Dongen at the 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the fire-damaged businesses struggled to reestablish their 
shops earlier this year in temporary quarters in town, Hutson and others tried 
to persuade about six Sierra Madre Boulevard property owners, including some on 
Baldwin Avenue untouched by fire, to band together to create a major project 
for the corner. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan seemed too risky for some. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, it wasn't a very good deal for us," said Tracy Miller, whose 
family owns Happy's. "They wanted us to tear down the building for the good of 
the town, spend half a million dollars just to improve a corner." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Miller said his family preferred to collect $90,000 in insurance money 
to repair their shop and continue in the building they have owned since 1934. 
</P>
<P>
The plans now submitted have been scaled down. Two buildings, one of 2,400 
square feet and the other 2,600 square feet, would be built on land owned by 
Helen Elliot and Fred Crockett. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-foot wide corridor separating the two-story buildings would lead to a 
courtyard with access to a back parking lot and the city's public parking lot 
on Mariposa Street. 
</P>
<P>
Next door to the east, property owner Berge Yeghiaian has submitted plans for 
another two-story building with a back entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Lower floors of the buildings would be reserved for an unspecified number of 
retail establishments, with offices on the second floors. 
</P>
<P>
To speed work on the project, the city's Community Redevelopment Agency 
promised to pay for the architectural plans, now estimated at $20,000. If those 
plans are approved, the building owners must pay back the city. The owners 
could also qualify for low-interest redevelopment loans. 
</P>
<P>
But the very modesty of the new plans could pose a stumbling block for their 
approval and for the granting of the loans. 
</P>
<P>
The plans do not meet the city's parking ordinance, which requires one parking 
space per 300 square feet of retail area. The City Council, which has taken an 
increasingly stern position in getting developers to meet parking requirements, 
would have to be persuaded that the project is of sufficient value to allow a 
variance from parking requirements. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a smaller project with fewer tax benefits for the city becomes 
harder for the council to justify spending public money on as a redevelopment 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be some reluctance on my part to do anything unless there is 
something that is really going to benefit the community," said Councilman Clem 
Bartolai. 
</P>
<P>
To assess just what benefits Sierra Madre would derive from the proposed 
buildings, the city plans to hire a consultant to look at the economic and 
legal issues involved. The package could come before the council in another 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sierra Madre residents are eager for their city to recover from the 
most devastating downtown fire in its history. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole city is waiting for the opening," gallery employee Van Dongen said.

MALIBU LAND EMPIRE HITS FINANCIAL SNAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The corporate descendant of one of California's most enduring land empires has 
hit a financial snag and may be forced to mortgage some of its real estate to 
pay its debts. 
</P>
<P>
In court documents obtained by The Times, officials of the Adamson Cos., one of 
Malibu's largest landowners, disclosed that as of last month, the firm had run 
out of cash and was unable to pay the more than $1 million it owes. 
</P>
<P>
The documents quote company officials as saying that, to raise cash, they were 
considering a mortgage of the Point Dume Club, a luxury mobile home park on 91 
acres of oceanfront in Malibu that provides more than half the firm's income. 
</P>
<P>
However an attorney for the company insisted in an interview that its finances 
were healthy, and that company officials were no longer considering encumbering 
the valuable property. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is financially stable; it's well managed and in good shape," 
attorney Thomas K. Houston said. 
</P>
<P>
Houston called the firm's troubles "a relatively insignificant short-term cash 
problem" and said the company has persuaded several creditors to extend their 
loans and is negotiating with two banks for lines of credit. 
</P>
<P>
The company's troubles come at a time when it is trying to start work on a 
$65-million, 300-room luxury hotel overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu. It 
still needs final approvals from the California Coastal Commission before 
construction may begin. 
</P>
<P>
Just three weeks ago, Adamson announced it had joined with the Sazale Corp., a 
Japanese firm, in a bid to develop and manage the hotel. Court records show 
that Adamson intends to retain no more than a 15% share of the project. 
</P>
<P>
A bitter legal battle between heirs of the late Merritt Adamson provides an 
unusual glimpse of the firm's finances and of the family feud that has 
intensified in the four years since he died of cancer at age 56. 
</P>
<P>
The land empire was founded in 1892 by Adamson's grandfather, Frederick 
Hastings Rindge, and, at its peak in the early part of this century, included 
some 17,000 acres along the Malibu coast. 
</P>
<P>
Four months before he died, Merritt Adamson signed a partnership agreement with 
his sisters, Sylvia Rindge Adamson Neville and Rhoda-May Adamson Dallas, that 
gave them future control of the company and left his widow, Sharon, with little 
say in its affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement replaced one drawn up 18 years earlier that had provided that, 
upon the death of any of the siblings, his or her heirs could take out a 
one-third share of the company's assets at full market value. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new arrangement, however, the sisters became sole general partners 
when their brother died, and Sharon Adamson was left with little say over her 
inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit against her former sisters-in-law, Sharon Adamson, along with her 
two adult children, contends that the agreement should be invalidated since, by 
signing it, her husband made a gift of the couple's community property without 
her consent. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also seeks to remove Neville and Dallas as trustees of nearly 
one-third of the company's shares that Sharon Adamson purports to own, but does 
not control, as a result of the agreement. It contends that Neville and Dallas 
are inept managers who have steered the company to the brink of ruin. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters have filed a lawsuit of their own seeking to have the agreement 
enforced. If they prevail, Sharon Adamson would be prevented from having a 
voice in the company's affairs. 
</P>
<P>
A trial has been set for October in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Superior Court Judge Bonnie Lee Martin is to rule this week on a 
request by an attorney for Sharon Adamson to appoint a receiver to manage the 
company's affairs. A court-appointed referee last month recommended against a 
receivership. 
</P>
<P>
Hillel Chodos, Sharon Adamson's attorney, said that unless the court intervenes 
there is a "grave threat" that the company's properties may be dissipated, 
adding: "My clients are simply seeking some kind of interim relief to preserve 
and protect their interests until there is a trial." 
</P>
<P>
Houston, the company's attorney, denied that the company is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Neville and Dallas declined to be interviewed, as has Sharon Adamson. However, 
friends and former business associates say the rift between the sisters and 
widow of the late Merritt Adamson has become intensely personal. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Sharon Adamson, who receives a salary of at least $18,000 a 
month from the company as required by the agreement, appeared before the 
Coastal Commission in Long Beach to urge that a permit for the hotel not be 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
She also refuses to go along with her former sisters-in-law in dealing away six 
acres owned by the three of them near Pepperdine University where Los Angeles 
County wants to build a controversial sewer treatment plant. The county has 
said it plans to acquire the property by condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
In her lawsuit, Sharon Adamson contends that the 69-year-old Neville, the 
firm's managing general partner, has entrusted the company to advisers with 
little experience in managing its real estate holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Neville hired Olaf Isachsen, a strategic planning 
consultant. He was recently given the title of chairman of the executive 
committee, at an annual salary of $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
In pretrial questioning by lawyers for Sharon Adamson, Isachsen said that his 
primary role was to render advice to Neville, and that he did not yet consider 
himself qualified to manage the company's affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Isachsen's contract provides for severance pay of $400,000 should he be 
discharged for any reason, the use of a company car, and the use of half of a 
duplex owned by the company next door to its offices in West Los Angeles.

THEATER: LONG BEACH CIVIC LIGHT OPERA TRIES TO REACH A NEW ETHNIC AUDIENCE WITH 
A FREE, FLAG-WAVING MUSICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An estimated 1,900 Cambodians showed up at the Terrace Theater last week for 
the Long Beach Civic Light Opera's production of "1776," a musical comedy 
celebrating the birth of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Only a portion of them, however, actually saw the play. 
</P>
<P>
Walking freely in and out of the auditorium during the performance, many 
noisily tended their crying babies and chattering children. Several hundred 
spent most of the first act lounging in the lobby eating Cambodian egg rolls 
and visiting with friends. And by the beginning of the second act, nearly half 
of the audience had gone home. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it must be good," said one man, speaking through an interpreter in the 
lobby, "but I don't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Such was the tenor of an unusual experiment in community relations and the 
theater company's latest sojourn into a marketing technique that it helped 
pioneer: tailoring artistic productions for specific ethnic audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what to expect," said Pegge Logefeil, managing director, adding 
that last Sunday's special performance was the company's first major attempt to 
woo Asians. 
</P>
<P>
What happened initially caused some alarm. Distracted and confused by the 
audience's apparent inattention, some cast members temporarily lost their 
composure, at several points they even laughed aloud on stage. At a hastily 
called backstage meeting during intermission, they decided to cut major 
portions of dialogue out of the final act. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't hear ourselves think, let alone speak," said Franc Luz, who 
portrays Thomas Jefferson. "It was like nothing I've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
In his dressing room after the performance, Dean Jones, who headlines the 
production as John Adams, made a startling confession. "I just lost it," he 
said. "It was the least professional performance you'll ever see out of this 
cast." 
</P>
<P>
Yet LBCLO organizers consider the event a success. If there was a shortcoming, 
they said later, it was theirs for not acquainting the Cambodians with American 
theater etiquette beforehand and for inviting them to a production requiring a 
fairly sophisticated command of English. Next time the company decides to 
entertain the city's large Cambodian population, Logefeil said, it will choose 
a more accessible production that will be of interest to children as well as 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
There will definitely be a next time, she stressed. For reaching out to the 
area's diverse ethnic communities is part of what the company is all about. 
</P>
<P>
The approach was "discovered" almost by accident five years ago, Logefeil said, 
at a time when the civic light opera, like almost every other artistic 
organization in town, was experiencing major financial difficulties. Facing a 
deficit of about $950,000, she said, "we were trying everything we could to 
market tickets and sell the show." 
</P>
<P>
One of the shows that season was "Song of Norway," a musical based on the life 
of Norwegian songwriter Edvard Grieg. Someone -- Logefeil does not remember who 
-- suggested targeting the large Norwegian community that had settled over the 
years in nearby San Pedro. Unsure of where to begin, the company's marketing 
experts approached the owner of a popular Norwegian bakery there and the rest, 
as they say, is history. 
</P>
<P>
He provided an extensive mailing list and other contacts in the community. And 
by offering discounted tickets to Norwegians, the company not only experienced 
one of its biggest-ever box office hits, but generated lots of financial 
support from Norwegian businesses and community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the turning points of the LBCLO," Logefeil said. "We realized 
that there was a whole community of people out there that we weren't aware of 
who were willing to support a show. It gave us the lift that we needed; what we 
found was that communities stick together." 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing years, the company used the same technique to successfully 
market "The Sound of Music" to Germans and Austrians; "Evita" to Argentines and 
other Latin Americans; and "Dream Girls" to members of the local black 
community. 
</P>
<P>
While initially the strategy involved only marketing what had already been 
scheduled, Logefeil said, recently it has begun to effect decisions on what to 
produce. Earlier this season, for instance, the company put on "Sophisticated 
Ladies," a show aimed specifically at black audiences that garnered several 
awards from the NAACP. Next year it plans to produce "Pearly" and "Porgy and 
Bess," both of which are expected to draw blacks. 
</P>
<P>
And producers say they are actively seeking productions of particular interest 
to the region's large Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Targeting the city's estimated 40,000 Cambodians was a relatively recent idea, 
Logefeil said. Because there were no shows on the schedule aimed specifically 
at Asians, she said, promoters decided to put on a special performance of 
"1776" for the Cambodians, many of whom are refugees relatively new to the 
United States. Among other things, they hoped, the show might impart some 
knowledge of American history. 
</P>
<P>
Than Pok, executive director of the United Cambodian Community that helped 
publicize the event, thought the idea was excellent. "For many," he said, "this 
is the first exposure to the cultural life here. They feel that the community 
is giving them a welcome. Although they live in Long Beach, (many) never knew 
this existed." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other ethnic audiences for which tickets were merely discounted, 
Logefeil said, the Cambodians were admitted free. Besides providing a public 
service, she said, the theater company hopes that some of them will grow 
enamored enough of American musicals to eventually become subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
To ease that transition, however, the LBCLO took several steps to make the 
theatergoers comfortable. Cambodian egg rolls and paper-wrapped chicken were 
served in the lobby while the crowd was entertained by a pre-show concert of 
traditional Cambodian music. Each person who entered the theater was given a 
small American flag. And each was handed a program containing a Khmer-language 
synopsis of the show, as well as a translation of the Bill of Rights and 
portions of the Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
The cost, Logefeil said, came to about $20,000, three-fourths of which was paid 
for by grants from American Express and General Telephone. Despite its shaky 
start, most of those involved said the program ultimately did what it was 
supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out to be a difficult but strangely moving experience," actor Luz 
said. "We all felt good about it." 
</P>
<P>
The task was made easier during the second act by the fact that those remaining 
in the audience finally seemed more attuned to what was happening on stage than 
to the tumult in the lobby, he said. As a result, the actors reversed their 
earlier decision to cut the script and ended by giving the Cambodians a nearly 
complete, "impassioned as ever" final act, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the real coup de theatre, according to Jones, came after the last line was 
spoken and the last song was sung. Then, in an unexpected gesture of 
appreciation, almost all of those remaining in the audience stood at their 
seats and proudly waved their tiny American flags while the cast, outfitted 
from backstage with their own patriotic banners, responded in kind. 
</P>
<P>
At that moment, Jones said, audience and actors were one. "We were simply 
American actors," he said, "and they were new Americans."

Curtistina Dawkins enrolled in Compton Community College in 1963, but dropped 
out after a few weeks to get a job to help her parents, seven sisters and three 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
But Dawkins never gave up her dream of returning to college. In June, she 
graduated with high honors, earning a 3.66 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated school as a child. The teacher would tell me to find a quiet place at 
home to study, but that was unrealistic with eight girls sleeping in one room," 
Dawkins said. Twenty- seven years after dropping out, Dawkins was the student 
keynote speaker at the college's 1990 commencement. "You're never too young to 
dream a dream, and you're never too old to see that dream come to pass," the 
44-year-old mother and grandmother told the 250 graduates. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins received some of the loudest applause from more than 40 relatives in 
attendance. The group included her parents, eight of her siblings, her husband 
George, and the couple's four children and two grandchildren. She is the first 
family member to graduate from college. 
</P>
<P>
Her sister, Cynthia Scott, 40, plans to be the second family member to get a 
college degree. Scott actually enrolled at Compton before Dawkins, but has been 
on maternity leave, Dawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins has enrolled at Cal State Dominguez Hills and intends to get a 
bachelor's degree in psychology. Eventually, she plans to work as a marriage, 
family and child counselor. Meanwhile, Dawkins will continue as associate 
minister at the Christian Community Foursquare Church in Compton. The pastor is 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
James L. Ash Jr., president of Whittier College, has been appointed chairman of 
a panel on postsecondary learning, teaching and assessment by the U.S. 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Ash will direct the seven-member panel's selection process for establishing an 
educational research and development center, which will conduct a five-year 
research project on how to improve education in the nation's colleges and 
universities. A site for the center has not been selected. The center will 
receive a $1-million federal research grant each year. 
</P>
<P>
Eight graduates of Long Beach City College have been honored as President's 
scholars. All completed honors-level courses and maintained a grade-point 
averages of at least 3.5. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Cummings plans to attend an Eastern school, major in liberal arts, then 
teach. Rocco Basso will major in criminology at Cal State Long Beach. Basso 
works as a peace officer for the U.S. Department of Justice. Bryan Churchill 
hopes to attend law school after receiving a degree in English from UCLA. Hazel 
Dulla will study sociology at UCLA. She hopes to work in public relations or 
business administration. Kelly Finn plans to attend UC Santa Cruz or UC 
Berkeley and major in environmental science. She hopes to become an 
environmental engineer or go into wildlife management. David Goldstein expects 
to attend UC Berkeley or UCLA and major in political science. He wants to study 
underdeveloped countries. Stephen Woods will go to UCLA and study political 
science with a minor in business administration. He plans to go to law school. 
Grant Young will attend UCLA or UC Berkeley and major in economics before 
pursuing a master's degree in business administration. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Police Sgt. Michael Woodward has been chosen the state's outstanding 
police officer of the year by the American Legion. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward, who has been with the Long Beach force for 21 years, was named the 
department's employee of the year in 1989. He has won more than 60 medals in

WEST HOLLYWOOD HAS BIG HOPES FOR LITTLE LOANS; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: NINE AREA BANKS HAVE JOINED A CITY PROGRAM TO OFFER LOW-INTEREST LOANS 
TO FLEDGLING BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nine West Hollywood-area banks have pledged to create a $135,000 fund this year 
to make small, low-interest commercial loans to fledgling West Hollywood 
businesses under the city's new Micro-Loan Program. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, small-business loans of up to $10,000 will be made available 
to local businesses at prevailing commercial interest rates as part of an 
effort to recycle money back into the community. The banks have also agreed to 
reduce from three years to one the time a business must have operated to 
qualify for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a financial service banks don't normally do because they don't make 
that much money on it," said Deborah Potter, city coordinator for the program. 
The city asked the banks to take part in the program, and loans will be 
initiated through the Housing and Economic Development Division. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, banks have found it unprofitable to offer low-interest, 
commercial loans of $10,000 or less, Potter said. "Business owners who want to 
borrow small amounts are usually required to pay an interest rate that is much 
higher, more like that charged for a credit card," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Each bank participating in the program pledged to make $15,000 in loans to be 
paid off in five years at an interest rate of about 13%. Participants include 
the Bank of Los Angeles, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Mitsui Manufacturers 
Bank, Sanwa Bank, Sumitomo Bank, First Interstate Bank, City National Bank and 
Olympic National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Besides helping businesses, Potter said, the loan program is designed to help 
local financial institutions meet national lending requirements set by the 
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. The law requires financial institutions to 
improve their lending records in the communities where they operate. 
</P>
<P>
The loans will enable small businesses to modernize by purchasing new 
equipment, expanding, restocking inventories and even switching to different 
accounting procedures. "It is a citywide program that will be especially 
helpful on the city's east end, where businesses have been struggling," Potter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Henderson, a regional vice president of the Bank of Los Angeles, said the 
program will help build a "working relationship with small businesses and help 
them to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lehman, president of the West Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, agreed. "It's 
difficult for small businesses to get loans because most loans are geared 
towards larger businesses," he said. "West Hollywood is a city of small 
businesses. This program is a harbinger of good things to come." 
</P>
<P>
Those seeking information about loans can call the city Housing and Economic 
Development Division at (213) 854-7468.

CLAREMONT OKS PLAN TO NARROW SANTA FE STREET

<P>
The Claremont City Council has voted to narrow part of Santa Fe Street to 
provide parking spaces for a senior citizen housing complex. 
</P>
<P>
The decision last Tuesday came despite complaints by merchants that the 
narrowing would further restrict limited public parking on Santa Fe, and thus 
increase traffic congestion on the street. 
</P>
<P>
In approving the street narrowing, the council added a provision requiring the 
developer of the housing complex to reserve 11 parking spaces for both the 
public and residents of Heritage Village, a 154-unit, low-cost senior-citizen 
housing complex scheduled to open in mid-1991. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a city survey showed that many of those who park along Santa Fe are 
Trans-America Insurance employees. City officials said they will ask the 
company to encourage employees to instead use a parking structure in Village 
Plaza, where their firm is located. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Street is currently 58 feet wide and is to be narrowed by 24 1/2 feet 
between Indian Hill Boulevard and Olive Street, City Manager Glenn Southard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Calmark Vice President Frank Cardone, whose company is building the housing 
complex, said he was pleased with the council's decision.

Assistant City Manager John F. Shirey is one of seven candidates for the city 
manager's job in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
City officials there released the names of the finalists last week. 
</P>
<P>
Shirey said he has not been officially notified that he is on the finalist list 
and has not been interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Shirey, the second-highest ranking official in city government, has been 
assistant city manager for three years. He said Thursday that he is not 
actively looking for a job but was contacted by a recruiter about the 
Cincinnati post and decided that he is interested. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want you to say that I'm unhappy and disgruntled and looking to leave, 
because I'm not," said Shirey, 41. "(Cincinnati is) a large city with large 
city problems and large city challenges and a lot like what we find in Long 
Beach. The difference is I would be the city manager and not No. 2." 
</P>
<P>
Shirey said he expects he will go to Ohio for interviews next month. BETTINA

GAYS 'DELIGHTED' BY SHERIFF'S POLICY

<TEXT>

We were delighted to see the article by John Mitchell (Times, July 19) about 
the improvement of the West Hollywood Sheriff's Station's relationship with the 
lesbian and gay community under Capt. Rachel Burgess. We also applaud Capt. 
Burgess' efforts to meet with lesbian and gay representatives, to sensitize the 
deputies under her command, and to recruit openly lesbian and gay people into 
the force. 
</P>
<P>
As Capt. Burgess noted, while there are lesbians and gay men on the force, none 
of them are currently open about their orientation. We are hopeful that in the 
supportive environment she is fostering they will feel more comfortable about 
being more visible as lesbians and gay men.

FLORES SEEKS CUT IN LEASE FEE FOR FLOATING MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores has urged the Harbor Department to 
negotiate a "more reasonable" lease for the merchant ship Lane Victory, after 
learning a proposed agreement was too expensive for the nonprofit group that 
has turned the vessel into a floating merchant marine museum. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the port to remember this is a nonprofit group . . . and that it brings 
some glory, some honor and some recognition to the port itself," she said. 
"Hopefully, there are some benefits that you can't measure in money alone." 
</P>
<P>
Flores also has criticized the port for proposing a lease so confusing that 
even port officials disagreed about what it would require. 
</P>
<P>
The latest developments in the search for a permanent home for the Lane Victory 
came Tuesday during a brief status report to the council's Commerce, Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee, which Flores chairs. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mark Richter, the port's assistant property manager, said 
the port had offered a 10-year lease at Berth 53 to the ship's owner, the U.S. 
Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II. The Long Beach-based group was given 
the 1945 vessel by Congress two years ago and is restoring it as a museum and 
memorial at Berth 52. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the lease, Richter said, the port would not charge the 
nonprofit group for use of a wharf adjacent to Berth 53, but would expect a fee 
of $7,600-a-month for the first five years of the agreement and $14,600-a-month 
for the last five years of the lease. The Lane Victory could move to Berth 53 
when a lease is signed. 
</P>
<P>
But those terms conflicted with earlier descriptions of the lease, which showed 
the veterans group in addition would be expected to pay 5% of its gross 
receipts to the harbor in the last five years of the 10-year lease. Those terms 
were spelled out both in a June 5 letter to the veterans group from Michael 
Lemke, Richter's boss, and a July 23 memo to Flores from Harbor Commission 
Secretary Peter Mandia. 
</P>
<P>
In either case, the veterans told Flores, the lease terms were too expensive 
for the group, which only recently began charging visitors $2 to tour the Lane 
Victory. Without a less expensive lease, a group official said, 90% of the 
first year revenues collected from visitors would go toward berthing the Lane 
Victory. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion over the actual offer by the port and the cost of either lease 
arrangement to the veterans group led Flores to ask that the port return to 
negotiations on a lease for the Lane Victory. "It seems to me something more 
favorable can be worked out," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
The councilwoman said she was particularly miffed that the port would charge a 
nonprofit organization such an unreasonable rate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the community and the organization and the City Council and the mayor 
view this as a nonprofit memorial and not as a moneymaker for them or the 
port," Flores said. "And I thought that's what the negotiations were based on." 
</P>
<P>
Flores asked port officials to return to the committee next month with a status 
report on the lease.

PICO RIVERA DIAL-A-RIDE VANS HAUL 7,500 PEOPLE IN 3 MONTHS

<P>
PICO RIVERA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It isn't Metro Rail, but a free form of public transportation in Pico Rivera is 
getting a proportion of ridership that might prompt envy among county transit 
officials. Although Pico Rivera has but 60,000 residents, more than 7,500 
passengers used the city's dial-a-ride system in the second quarter of this 
year alone. 
</P>
<P>
That is a 50% increase over two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
People 55 or older and people with handicaps can use the van service for any 
trip within city limits. Rides outside the city are limited to medical, 
education or social-service appointments. Eligible city residents, about a 
sixth of the population, can use the service by telephoning 721-5666 a day or 
two in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Pico Rivera started the program in 1984, charging 75 cents per ride. The city 
dropped the fare to 25 cents before finally removing the fee entirely. 
Dial-a-ride costs the city about $25,000 a month and runs seven days a week, 
although the hours of service are reduced on weekends. Numerous other cities 
have their own versions of dial-a-ride.

Photo, Spider Man Would Be Proud: Climbing enthusiast Craig Garrison uses small 
handholds and footholds attached to a 16-foot-high concrete wall near Cal State 
Long Beach to practice his technique. A close-up of his foot shows the special 
shoes that advanced climbers wear. The soles are made of special rubber that 
gives good adhesion, and the fit is snug so the foot is less likely to slip off 
rock nubbins. Flat vertical climbing such as on this man-made wall requires 
more precision in movement than might be needed on a rock slope, said Garrison, 
a Long Beach resident and graduate student at the university who has been 
climbing for more than three years. "It's you against the wall," Garrison said. 
"When you can't make a foothold and fall off, it increases the challenge." MARC

FIGHTING WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Fighting Words," by Sarah Henry (June 10), I have been a bilingual 
teacher for 15 years. The great majority of those who immigrate here value 
English very much. 
</P>
<P>
Give them three to seven years and they will learn to speak English. Many will 
learn English in crowded evening English as a Second Language classes -- after 
picking your food, cleaning your table at restaurants, hauling off your trash, 
fixing your car, cleaning the bedpans at your local hospital or cleaning your 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Their children will learn, too. If they are lucky, they will maintain skills in 
their native language. That will increase their chance of landing a better job 
than that of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of these immigrants will learn English, even with all the 
hardships they must endure as America's underclass. Will you, advocates of 
English only, learn compassion?

Although it is true that Massachusetts and Virginia were settled by English 
speakers, it is also true that from Florida to California, the only European 
language was Spanish, even before the Mayflower. The arguments the Proposition 
63 people raise have nothing to do with unity but rather with supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing the English-speaking slave owners did after bringing the 
Africans to the United States was to separate them so they would forget their 
language. Forget your language, and you forget your culture. Forget the 
culture, and you forget the history. Forget the history -- and Anglos have 
always been here, because it was their destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Forget your native language, and be fed exclusively by ethnocentric 
schoolteachers and by Madison Avenue. Forget Spanish, and it's OK to invade 
Central America. After all, those are not our people; they don't speak English!

LYNN WILLIAMS, her thin, young body racked with pain, was still in the throes 
of heroin withdrawal when she stumbled through the doorway of the Pasadena drug 
recovery house last fall. The bizarre scene that confronted her might have been 
another one of her drug-induced hallucinations: In the shady courtyard of the 
sprawling stucco complex, a work crew raked leaves where there were none. A man 
walked by wearing a muzzle. A woman carried a Narcotics Anonymous book in 
handcuffed hands. 
</P>
<P>
Those extraordinary disciplinary measures are everyday occurrences at the 
residential drug recovery program, where addicts are asked to abandon not only 
drugs but also their will. Let me out of here, Williams thought, panicking. But 
she had nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
At 23, Williams had reached the end of the road. What had started out as a 
pleasant escape from the pain of a troubled childhood in the San Fernando 
Valley had turned into a nightmare from which she could not awaken. She hated 
living in abandoned buildings, stealing and breaking into people's homes, 
sleeping with men she didn't know. All for a fix. She wanted to die. 
</P>
<P>
Once settled in her new environment, Williams knew she had to stop running, 
acknowledging that this time she would "have to change completely." Despite her 
heavy eye makeup and her chain-smoking, she looked as vulnerable as a small 
child, with long, silky blond hair. "I don't know how to live," she said, her 
voice cracking. 
</P>
<P>
Williams wanted to learn, but she knew it wouldn't be easy. Every day, she saw 
addicts drop out of the recovery program only to return to the streets. She 
knew what awaited her there, and it terrified her. Nearly every week brought 
word of dropouts who had landed in jail, died of an overdose or been shot in 
drug deals. 
</P>
<P>
She had used drugs since she was 11, starting with alcohol and marijuana -- her 
parents' drugs of choice. "I grew up thinking it was OK," she recalled. When 
her parents divorced, her mother gave up her career as a professional jazz 
dancer to raise her three children. And she never let them forget it. 
</P>
<P>
The counselors assured Williams there was another way. It would entail hard 
work and require discipline, honesty and self-esteem, qualities she didn't know 
she had. It would take months of self-analysis and the courage to examine 
emotions buried long ago. Yes, they could help her change her life. There was 
only one condition: Williams would have to turn herself over to them. It would 
require a leap of faith in a "higher power" -- be it God, a higher 
consciousness or whatever name she chose to give it. 
</P>
<P>
She wasn't sure she could meet this challenge. Without drugs' anesthesia, the 
pain and remorse were overwhelming. "When emotions sneak up on you," Williams 
said, shaking her head, "you feel like you're going to die." 
</P>
<P>
THE IMPACT ALCOHOL and Drug Recovery Program operates out of a motel-like 
building, one of several unassuming structures that house drug programs and 
convalescent hospitals at the northern end of Fair Oaks Avenue. On clear days, 
the San Gabriel Mountains seem deceptively close enough to touch. Just a few 
blocks south, drug dealers beckon on the streets that surround the King's 
Village public housing project. 
</P>
<P>
Impact is one of about two dozen private, nonprofit drug recovery houses in Los 
Angeles County. Established in 1971, it is among the oldest of these long-term 
residential programs and is funded largely through government grants. Nearly 
25% of the facility's 130 slots are set aside for state and federal parolees 
referred to the program through the courts. The county pays for another third 
of the slots to accommodate indigent addicts. A quarter of the slots are paid 
for by private health insurance or by residents' families. The average four- to 
six-month stay, including a few months of outpatient care, runs about $15,000 
per resident. The program's clinical staff of about 60 includes administrators, 
medical personnel and 15 caseworkers -- the vast majority of whom have all 
kicked drug habits of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Battle-scarred addicts arrive by the thousands every day at facilities like 
Impact across the country. Most don't last past the first few weeks of these 
intensive, months-long treatment programs, thought by experts to offer the best 
chance at recovery. Some drop out; others are expelled, usually because they 
are deemed not serious enough about getting better. An encouraging note, 
counselors say, is that more than a third of those who leave prematurely return 
months, sometimes years, later to give recovery another try. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you get into the mainstream of the drug recovery subculture, you cannot 
deny -- ever again -- that there isn't another way to go. That seed gets 
planted," said James Stillwell, Impact's director. Silver-haired, 
smooth-talking and energetic, the administrator has been clean for 17 years and 
still attends meetings of Narcotics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The odds that Williams would stay and ultimately quit drugs were overwhelmingly 
against her. Only about one out of five of those who land at Impact makes it 
through the program, one of the toughest and most respected in Southern 
California. Even for those who complete the grueling residential program, there 
are no guarantees. Most addicts have long histories of failed attempts at 
getting -- and staying -- clean. 
</P>
<P>
Once at Impact, addicts who have spent most of their lives trying to forget 
must delve into the darkest corners of their souls and expose their secrets -- 
incest, betrayal, prostitution, even murder -- to the world. Ultimately, they 
must strip away the self-loathing and guilt and learn to embrace themselves, to 
find the courage to change. They must give up the lying, cheating, manipulation 
and self-deception that typically ensnare addicts' lives. They must trust drug 
counselors to show them the way. Based on the "12 Step" philosophy of 
Alcoholics Anonymous and its offshoot, Narcotics Anonymous, the program aims to 
instill addicts with a new purpose and provide them a new foundation for 
rebuilding their lives. 
</P>
<P>
When Williams showed up, there was already a broad spectrum of addicts at the 
recovery house: a Beverly Hills "little rich girl" who ended up turning $50 
tricks in Hollywood for her pimp; a middle-aged $75,000-a-year mechanic who, 
after losing it all -- his family, his job, his yacht and his dreams -- climbed 
atop the Gerald Desmond Bridge in Long Beach and stared at the churning ocean 
water below; a mild-mannered Mexican-American house painter who, having 
betrayed family and friends, hid behind the inviolable mask of a street-wise 
Chicano. 
</P>
<P>
There was also a Korean immigrant who had convinced himself that he didn't have 
a drug problem, just a run of bad luck -- even after he was arrested for 
selling crack cocaine to an undercover agent at the post office where he 
worked. Soon after arriving, Williams befriended a striking brunette whose life 
read like something out of a bad B movie: witchcraft practitioner, teen-age 
runaway, topless dancer, biker moll and cat burglar with a 20-year prison 
sentence hanging over her head. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers were expected to start by focusing on their reasons for being there. 
For the first 45 days, they were cut off from most contact with the outside 
world and kept busy with menial chores. At this stage, some were still dealing 
with denial about the severity of their drug problem. As they peeled away 
layers of self-deceit, they were allowed to visit home and go out on weekends. 
Dramatic turnarounds were common at this stage, as residents embraced the 
program's philosophy and glimpsed a life without drugs. Some, however, 
continued to stumble, unable to surrender their will. 
</P>
<P>
During the second half of their stay, residents began working at outside jobs. 
The real tests began as they continued outpatient treatment at the conclusion 
of the live-in portion of the program: Some folded under the emotional 
pressures of disintegrating marriages or the day-to-day grind of rebuilding 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Through all this, the members of Williams' group would experience miraculous 
turnarounds -- only to be sidetracked at the next turn by old character flaws. 
Inevitably, some would fall back on drugs. But even then, most would continue 
the ever-tenuous struggle to liberate themselves. This is a chronicle of their 
six months at Impact. 
</P>
<P>
THE FIRST WEEKS at Impact can be the toughest. Everything -- from the strict 
discipline to the endless rounds of therapy sessions -- is geared to helping 
addicts recognize that they have a problem not only with drugs but also, more 
fundamentally, with living. The transition from the streets to such a narrowly 
focused world can be especially jarring. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the violent spasms of withdrawal that tormented Williams' body began 
to subside, the craziness of Impact did not. Williams saw other residents 
forced to wear wool mittens as punishment for stealing even a comb or a vial of 
lipstick. Those who "held their mud" -- refused to snitch on a fellow addict 
who had broken a house rule -- had to carry large jars of mud for the day. 
Anyone balking at the regimen had to wear a sign around the neck; "Am I being 
held hostage?" one read. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our tactics may seem pretty harsh," Stillwell said. "But when you're 
up against a life-and-death struggle, you don't play games. We call a spade a 
spade from day one. We dump reality on them. We don't allow them to wriggle out 
with a bunch of talk. We know all about that. We've been there ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, Williams battled the urge to flee. She longed for drugs' oblivion. 
Maybe this time heroin would be a kinder master. But slowly the program began 
making sense. "All your old rules, right or wrong, go out the window," she 
said. The counselors "really break down your ego, your addict values, your 
false pride." 
</P>
<P>
Obediently, Williams got up and went to bed when she was told to. She scrubbed 
toilets, dusted where there was no dust, washed spotless windows and swept 
imaginary leaves in the courtyard just as she had seen others do. Discipline 
had always been missing in her life. Now, she learned to appreciate it. 
</P>
<P>
She also attended daily counseling sessions and group meetings during which 
addicts told life stories not unlike her own. It demanded brutal honesty. Would 
she, cold sober, have the courage to withstand the pain of her past? 
</P>
<P>
Standing before a women's counseling group, Williams swept her long, straight 
hair aside and, in her small voice, talked about the large drawing she held up 
for them. The assignment, like many at Impact, was aimed at helping the women 
dredge up suppressed -- and often painful -- bits of their past. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' drawing depicted two small children cowering from a masked intruder 
and their mother's angry face and accusing finger. Williams explained that when 
she was 9 years old, a family friend had sneaked into her bedroom almost every 
night for a year and raped her in front of her younger brother. "My parents 
didn't believe me," she said, tears welling up in her eyes. As she spoke, she 
unconsciously folded her drawing over and over until it was a tiny square of 
paper. At the group therapist's prompting, Williams lit it with a match. 
Transfixed by the small flame, she smiled for the first time. It was as if the 
terrible memory itself had gone up in smoke, freeing her from its grip. 
</P>
<P>
Counselors say that the recovery process is especially difficult for women. 
Perhaps, they say, it is because women have a harder time coming to terms with 
histories that often include sexual abuse as well as with the greater stigma 
society attaches to drug abuse among women. And women tend to be more dependent 
than men and to place others' welfare above their own. Those who are mothers 
also often carry the guilt of neglecting or abusing their children. Many harbor 
an unwavering desire -- no matter how unrealistic -- to be with their families. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six-year-old Suzan Kidd, another member of the group, thought longingly 
and often about her three young children. Kidd had borne children because she 
wanted someone to love her unconditionally, but the terrible anger she carried 
inside spoiled that dream, too. When she was younger, she erupted in fits of 
violence against her family, once breaking her mother's ribs. Later, she turned 
her rage on her own children. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Kidd was sexually abused by her stepfather and later rescued by her 
grandparents, who brought her back to Southern California to live with them. 
Her grandmother's wish, Kidd said, "was that I grow up to be an independent 
lady, get a good education, get married and have children -- the same things I 
want for my children." 
</P>
<P>
But at 13, Kidd began running away from her grandparents' home and 
experimenting with drugs. Alcohol and pot gave way to cocaine, speed, PCP and 
heroin. Drugs helped her forget the sexual abuse. But they also led her into a 
seedy world of crime and violence, cheap bars and biker gangs, where excitement 
became as addictive as drugs. Kidd, a tall, natural beauty with thick brown 
hair that cascades past her shoulders, radiates a certain innocence. But her 
self-image couldn't have been more different. When she walked on the street, 
she said, she saw a different reflection in other people's eyes: prostitute, 
junkie, ex-con. Kidd, who specialized in breaking into post offices to steal 
checks and credit cards, served 10 months of a 16-month prison term for forgery 
related to the burglaries and still faces a 20-year term that was knocked down 
to probation when she signed up for Impact. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else, Kidd told everyone, she wanted to be a good mother. 
Under the program rules, she visited her children at her grandmother's home 
only occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Kidd's desire to be with them would be a stumbling block in her treatment. 
Outside issues, such as children and relationships, are a common distraction 
that counselors advise recovering addicts to lay aside. First they must put 
their own lives in order. 
</P>
<P>
LIKE KIDD, Karen Allen of Beverly Hills arrived on Impact's doorstep via the 
courts. The judge had reduced her four-year prison term for drug violations to 
probation. Most of Impact's residents arrive the same way: pressured by the 
judicial system, relatives or a spouse. What is crucial to their success, 
however, is that they make recovery a personal commitment -- that they do it 
for themselves and no one else. 
</P>
<P>
For Allen, a 27-year-old veteran of many drug treatment programs, this was a 
particularly difficult thing to do. She had always lived for the approval of 
others, particularly that of men. At Impact, she and other residents were 
frequently asked to write essays about forgiveness and independence, topics 
that would help them recognize and conquer their low self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
One of Allen's assignments was to write a letter to her former pimp -- the man 
she had once thought she was in love with. Whether she ever mailed the letter 
did not matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Tony," it began. "What we had was real sick. . . ." The letter, written 
in large, childlike block letters, recalled that Allen had wanted to bear this 
man's child. It also recalled how he beat her when she returned home 
empty-handed after working the streets and how his infidelity drove her into a 
suicidal depression. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully folding the piece of paper, Allen said that despite the searing anger 
she had begun to feel toward him, she still prayed that "he's not dead 
somewhere" and that he finds help with his addiction. "Deep down, he was a good 
person," she said. "He was just screwed up because of his (drug) disease, like 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Allen began learning to like herself. It happened only after many failed 
attempts at coming clean. Instead of heading for college, as her parents had 
planned, the Beverly Hills High School graduate floated in and out of some of 
the country's more exclusive drug recovery centers, where she hobnobbed with 
rock stars and professional football players. She was tossed out of one program 
for fraternizing with the men, which is strictly forbidden at most facilities. 
In addition, Allen went through four methadone maintenance centers and several 
detoxification treatments at hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Before Impact, Allen saw no real reason to quit. "I went to get my parents off 
my back," she said. "It was like a big joke to me." She'd been drinking and 
using pot since she was 12. By 15, she was snorting cocaine. A few years later, 
she shot up heroin for the first time with her older brother, who ended up in a 
drug recovery program as well but eventually managed to follow in their 
physician father's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs distanced Allen from the unhappy, overweight child she had been while 
growing up amid the "beautiful people." Then the bouts of bulimia and the car 
accidents linked to her drug abuse began. And, to satisfy her habit, Allen 
started stealing from her parents and their friends. 
</P>
<P>
Once, for about a year and a half, she stayed clean in Minnesota. Fooling 
herself that this time she would be able to control drugs, she returned to Los 
Angeles two years ago and fell off the wagon. Before long, the child born to 
privilege was out working the streets for her pimp. 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, Allen finally called home for help. When her mother came to 
pick her up, she didn't recognize her daughter, a gaunt, ashen woman with a 
bruised body, chipped teeth and black eyes. Doctors said Allen had so neglected 
her health and abused drugs that she might not live. 
</P>
<P>
Once she settled in at Impact, it didn't take Allen long to shed her rich-girl 
front -- designer clothes, expensive shampoos, snobbish airs -- and begin 
opening up. The difference between this time and all her previous attempts was 
that Allen had just fallen harder and lower than ever before. And, she figured, 
this really might be her last chance. 
</P>
<P>
JOHN MITCHELL can still picture the murky water as it looked from his perch on 
the Gerald Desmond Bridge in Long Beach. At the tail end of his last four-day 
run with crack, the master mechanic had nothing left but the 20 cents in his 
pocket. Suicide seemed the best way out. As his trembling hands locked onto a 
chain-link fence, the painful memories of his failed marriages and broken 
dreams came rushing back. But he could not jump. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, he sought help at Impact. There, the self-reliant 
48-year-old cried openly for the first time as he faced his guilt, especially 
over the slaying of one of his daughters in a bad drug deal a year and a half 
earlier. Though he was not directly involved, he couldn't forget that she had 
come to him for help after several years on the street. He shared his drugs 
with her instead. Besides the guilt, he acknowledged the feelings of sexual 
inadequacy that led to an unending cycle of drug use with prostitutes and the 
breakup of his three marriages. 
</P>
<P>
But more than midway through the program, Mitchell hit a wall. It happens all 
the time. Addicts arrive eager to learn. They do all that is asked of them, 
then suddenly plateau, afraid to take the next step. For many, the most 
frightening step of all is abandoning the addict's self-destructive tendencies, 
the only way of life they've known. But counselors insist that it is essential 
that they start anew. To accomplish it, the program often resorts to a "super 
session" -- an ambush by counselors who confront recalcitrant residents. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell had withdrawn from group sessions and resisted advice from his 
counselors. He also began making veiled threats about leaving the program. But 
his heart sank when he walked into the counseling office. There were half a 
dozen counselors and administrators, including Stillwell. Mitchell was sure he 
was about to be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
The counselors played good-cop-bad-cop, cajoling, accusing, pressing Mitchell's 
back to the wall. They said he wasn't cooperating with the program. "You've got 
to trust us; you've got to let us get close," one counselor said. Another told 
Mitchell that he couldn't pick and choose the parts of the program he wanted to 
follow. His commitment had to be unconditional. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell may have been an eager student of the Narcotics Anonymous principles, 
the counselors said, but he had failed to start living them. He hadn't 
abandoned his addict ways or placed his faith in a higher power. "Your 
resistance is why you're an addict," they said. "Your lack of surrender puts 
you in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
Confused and defensive, Mitchell claimed ignorance: "You're probably right, but 
I don't understand it. I feel I haven't tried to resist in any way." If he had 
decided to leave the program, as they accused him of threatening to do, he 
would be gone, he said, knowing they could see through his lies. "I'm being as 
cooperative as I can." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't good enough, they shot back. "You're using what you've used all your 
life -- your head and your mouth. Your brain doesn't recover you; your heart 
does!" Stillwell then posed a challenge: "Right now is the moment you're going 
to turn your will and life over to us, even if you don't understand what we are 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell didn't hesitate. "I'll do it," he said. But, inside, he was scared. He 
had never trusted anyone in his whole life. He was a master at manipulating 
others and was used to getting his own way. Yes, he wanted to learn a different 
way of living, but if he left things up to a higher power, things might not 
turn out the way he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he had done such a great job on his own. While he distinguished 
himself as a high school swimmer, making the U.S. water polo team and competing 
in the 1960 Olympics in Rome, he had to turn down college scholarships when his 
girlfriend became pregnant. Mitchell, who had already begun drinking heavily, 
apprenticed as a diesel-truck mechanic and began raising a family. 
</P>
<P>
Though his weekend binges came to include drugs as well, he held good jobs and 
took pride in being a good provider. While his work allowed him the luxury of 
buying drugs with his earnings without resorting to crime, Mitchell said, he 
wasn't above stealing from co-workers and employers. Along the way, his first 
two marriages soured. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, as his abuse of rock cocaine and heroin made it progressively 
harder for him to keep a job, his life unraveled before him. His third marriage 
disintegrated, and then there was his daughter's death. Mitchell also lost the 
36-foot yacht moored at Huntington Harbor that had been his home and the 
embodiment of a dream to one day sail around the world. To pay for his last 
binge before arriving at Impact, he sold his truck and his work tools. 
</P>
<P>
"Drugs kicked my ass," said a beaten-down Mitchell. "They won hands down." 
Impact, Mitchell believed, was his last hope. And he wasn't going to let his 
habitual self-deception and stubborn self-reliance stand in the way. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the super session, Mitchell began to express his new resolve in 
an essay about "How John controls his life and why." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm too much of a coward to let go," he admitted. "Just because I've lost 
everything doesn't mean I'm willing to turn loose of the control. It's real, 
real hard for me. I don't know how I will do it. I just will." 
</P>
<P>
THE PRESSURE from counselors at Impact never lets up. Residents find that every 
move is watched, every transgression is noted, any sign of backsliding is 
checked. They have nowhere to hide. 
</P>
<P>
It was under such scrutiny that Frank Castillo found himself making the 
all-important leap of faith. His surrender came like a sudden downpour in the 
middle of a drought. It was the kind of miracle that drug counselors say makes 
their job worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Castillo dallied. Since this was his third go-around at Impact, 
counselors had expected faster results. After all, the 32-year-old house 
painter was telling everybody that he wanted desperately to stay clean. But he 
did little more than parrot the "living-life-on-life's-terms" dogma the program 
preaches. 
</P>
<P>
Though Castillo believed he was satisfying the program's basic requirements, he 
was missing the point. His case was discussed at the weekly daylong staff 
meeting during which counselors assess each resident's performance. (Residents 
refer to the meetings as "Black Tuesdays.") The consensus on Castillo was that 
he was not delivering. 
</P>
<P>
So Castillo's counselor issued the ultimatum: He either straightened up his 
act, or he shipped out. Impact had a three-month waiting list and no time to 
waste on someone unwilling to give 100%. 
</P>
<P>
"What the hell do these people want!" an angry Castillo wanted to know after 
being confronted. He was doing his best. Did they really expect him to stand 
before a roomful of near strangers and share his innermost feelings? I've never 
done that in my life, not even with my own family! Castillo thought. It was too 
much to ask of a man, especially one who had spent much of his life hiding 
behind a veneer of machismo. 
</P>
<P>
He exploded again the next morning at a house meeting. "Give me one lion to 
tame at a time, not 10!" he shouted. Before he knew it, Castillo was not only 
venting his frustration but also spilling his guts. Something -- maybe the 
anger -- clicked, and the controlled, you-can't-get-to-me attitude melted away. 
Castillo realized his counselors were right. He had been hiding, even from 
himself. Castillo knew then that he would go to any length to stay clean, even 
if it meant baring his soul in front of 80 people. "I'll do it," Castillo said 
firmly. 
</P>
<P>
When he was a young boy, Castillo's parents moved to the predominantly Anglo 
middle-class community of Sierra Madre to get away from East Los Angeles' 
poverty and gangs. But Castillo felt he didn't belong there -- nor among the 
cholo gang-bangers at the predominantly Latino high school in Pasadena to which 
he was bussed. Still, to Castillo, the gangbangers were role models of "the 
Mexican I thought I should be." His identity problems seemed to ease in the 
drug haze that enveloped him at 15. He spent weekends partying and honed the 
tough-guy exterior he used against a world full of rejection. 
</P>
<P>
Though an early marriage ended in divorce, and he hardly knew his children, 
Castillo was convinced that he did not have a drug problem. PCP, pot, acid and 
speed were mild seducers compared with crack, which Castillo encountered about 
four years ago. The coke that he injected showered him with ecstasy beyond 
sexual orgasm. 
</P>
<P>
To pay for his $500-a-day habit, Castillo, who by then had lost his 
house-painting business, began stealing from employers, then neighbors and 
finally his own brothers, whose professional success he greatly admired. His 
second wife, who had resorted to welfare to feed their two small children, had 
had enough. Finally, when she threatened to leave him, Castillo sought help one 
more time. 
</P>
<P>
Now Castillo could admit to himself that he had been devastated by his first 
divorce; that his arrogance stemmed from claiming his brothers' accomplishments 
as his own; that his disciplinarian father cared for him after all. The relief 
accompanying these and so many other released emotions was amazing. He seemed 
suddenly exuberant, self-confident, at peace with himself. And now he willingly 
shared his experience with newer residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great about myself. Anything is possible," Castillo said. "It's a 
feeling I want to hang on to." 
</P>
<P>
MOVING DAY for Suzan Kidd arrived full of expectation on a clear January 
morning. It seemed light-years away from those mornings when she awakened 
dreading the new day, when her daylong mission would be finding drugs. Over the 
previous six months, she had rewritten her life's script. Sobriety seemed an 
exciting, if frightening, challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Having completed the most rigorous part of the program, she and some of the 
others began leaving Impact to start the slow process of rebuilding their lives 
on the outside. Most rented homes nearby while they continued outpatient 
treatment. By now, their odds for recovery had improved considerably. About 
two-thirds of those who make it past the first three months of the program 
survive to the end. 
</P>
<P>
Kidd had recently gone for a job interview at a religious bookstore. When the 
store manager asked about her previous experience, she burst into tears. She 
had no high school diploma, no work experience, no references. When he asked 
why, she told him the truth. Still, she got the job. 
</P>
<P>
On that January day, Kidd opened her first checking account with savings from 
the new job. She spent a few hours window-shopping at a nearby mall, feeling 
like an "upstanding person." When Karen Allen drove her to do some last-minute 
errands, they passed a police car and instinctively felt a twinge in their 
stomachs. Then, realizing they no longer had anything to fear, they laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Kidd was a whirl of activity, walking in circles as she packed her clothes. She 
sat on the edge of her bunk to gather her thoughts in the cramped quarters she 
shared with three others. "It's almost like I don't want to leave. I feel like 
I've barely scratched the surface of recovery," she said. "Now I'm really 
facing life by myself. It's really scary." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Kidd wouldn't be going far -- just moving into the home of another 
recovering addict. She still ached to be with her children, but counselors had 
warned her that she would be overwhelmed if she tried to resume caring for them 
right now. Although her counselors had their doubts about her, they knew there 
was little more they could do. She would attend weekly group sessions at a 
nearby clinic as well as Narcotics Anonymous meetings most nights. As part of 
the N.A. network, she had found a "sponsor" among more experienced recovering 
addicts. She learned that N.A. must become her guidepost for the rest of her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
As Kidd walked out of Impact for what everybody hoped would be the last time, 
well-wishers showered her with hugs and encouragement. "You're going to do just 
fine. I know you are," said a friend, fighting to hold back tears. 
</P>
<P>
THE EXCITEMENT of rejoining the outside world doesn't always last long. The 
problems graduates leave behind -- and which they used drugs to avoid -- await 
them there. But now they must deal with them sober. 
</P>
<P>
Jai Sim, the 30-year-old immigrant who faced his drug problem in the program, 
had been eager to return to his family's failing Long Beach grocery store to 
try to it. Within a few weeks after leaving Impact, however, he was feeling 
miserable. Overwhelmed by the demands of the store and a stressful separation, 
Sim was disgusted that he seemed no better able to cope with life than before. 
"I thought I was supposed to be better," said the bespectacled and shy man. 
</P>
<P>
At the slightest provocation, however, his thoughts returned to "using." For 
instance, after an argument with his mother over his marital problems, he had 
stomped out of the store and thought seriously about connecting with his 
favorite crack dealers. Nevertheless, Sim acknowledged that Impact's lessons 
had served him well. That afternoon, instead of giving in to the temptation, he 
calmed himself down with a cigarette and "shared" his frustrations later that 
evening with fellow recovering addicts at an N.A. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
This was a monumental change for Sim, who had always kept a tight lid on his 
personal problems. When he arrived at Impact, he didn't feel he belonged. His 
"little felony" for selling crack at the post office, he convinced himself, was 
nothing compared to the stories that he heard from others. They were hard-core 
heroin junkies and criminals. He was nothing of the kind. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Sim's whole life in the United States has been a struggle to reconcile 
the stoicism of his Asian upbringing with the realities of his new homeland. At 
19, soon after his family immigrated here, he enlisted in the Army. He wore the 
same uniform as everyone else but felt like an outsider. So, giving in to peer 
pressure, he started smoking hashish with the guys. The loneliness left him. To 
feed his habit, he started selling a little on the side. He was caught, 
court-martialed and ended his hitch with several months in a stockade. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned home, Sim couldn't find a job and began hanging out at 
Koreatown bars. But even among his own he felt alone. He got married, the 
marriage soured and his drug use escalated. By then, he was smoking crack every 
day, even during lunch breaks at the job he finally found at the post office. 
</P>
<P>
At Impact, Sim wept in front of others as he told how he had married and 
divorced a black woman but kept their son a secret from his grandfather. His 
parents had never accepted his wife, and his grandfather died without knowing 
about the child. Crying in public, he said, is something Koreans just don't do. 
But it had broken his emotional logjam. He accepted that he is a fragile as 
every other addict. 
</P>
<P>
As an outpatient, Sim continued to rely on the support of fellow addicts at 
nightly N.A. meetings and at weekly group therapy sessions. Sim told his 
support group that he still gets pressure from his estranged wife, his 
probation officer, his parents, his business. But he was thinking about 
organizing a Narcotics Anonymous chapter in Koreatown. Too often, Sim said, 
Asian recovering addicts receive little support from families who refuse to 
acknowledge such problems. To this day, Sim has not explained to his parents 
any details of his addiction or treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The others who listened in the smoke-filled meeting room agreed that the 
novelty of escaping day-to-day regimentation at Impact quickly wore off. Suzan 
Kidd also felt the world closing in around her. She had not yet found a car to 
buy, the bus ride to work was driving her nuts and she felt overwhelmed by her 
new job. She was irritable and impatient. "I still don't know if I like being 
responsible for myself. I find it real hard," she droned in a monotone. "How am 
I ever going to be able to raise three kids when I can't even get a room of my 
own or a car?" 
</P>
<P>
"We're all facing life on life's terms," the group counselor said. "It's not 
always going to be easy. But you have to keep remembering it is better than it 
was. Be happy with what you have today. Remember this is a lifelong process." 
</P>
<P>
ON GOOD Friday, Frank Castillo lost the battle. Loneliness hit him like a ton 
of bricks. He desperately missed his wife. He had gone back to work as a house 
painter and, as an outpatient, was renting a place with a few Impact graduates. 
But the program's demands were beginning to chafe like a leash around his neck. 
And his wife couldn't decide whether she wanted him back or not. 
</P>
<P>
The old hopelessness began closing in on him and sent Castillo tailspinning 
into despair. Almost instinctively, he found himself driving along Fair Oaks, 
not far from Impact but much closer to the spot where the drug dealers 
congregate. Someone offered him some crack and he took a hit. Castillo spent 
the rest of the night bartering what little he had -- a stereo, TV, radio and 
the tools his wife had bought him as a gift -- in exchange for another rock, as 
the solid and most addictive form of cocaine is also known. He and an 
acquaintance spent the whole night and much of the next day in his pickup on 
their bender. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo's relapse hit his old friends from Impact hard, but it didn't really 
surprise them. They are all too familiar with the razor-thin line that 
separates using from staying clean. What surprised them was how quickly 
Castillo recovered. As soon as he came down from his lost weekend, Castillo 
drove straight to Impact. While he knew he was automatically expelled from the 
program, he also knew he could find someone there to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo resumed attending N.A. meetings and vowed that he would never again 
allow his life to collapse around him. "I will not live that kind of hell 
anymore," he said, angrily stamping out another in a long chain of cigarettes 
as he talked openly about suicide. "I'll just get a real boost (overdose) and 
finish it." 
</P>
<P>
At times, he sounded like a spoiled child. He had put up with the loneliness of 
his wife's absence for six months, he said, and that was long enough. "I don't 
know how to deal without my honey, and I really don't want to," he said. "I 
want what I want when I want it!" 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a more reflective mood, tapping at his head, Castillo said, "This 
thing . . . is out to get me. That's the disease of addiction. It won't accept 
pain. It only wants to feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Castillo's counselors were not ready to give up, saying his resolve 
seemed stronger than ever. They advised Castillo to steel himself for the next 
test which, they assured him, would come -- over and over again. The counselor 
told Castillo that his priorities had become confused: His wife had become more 
important to him than his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, like Jai Sim and Suzan Kidd, Castillo had returned home to live with 
his parents, a move their former counselors did not consider positive. Castillo 
"really needs to break away, establish himself, grow up," his former counselor 
said. But it's not unusual, he added, for graduates to run back home upon 
re-entering a hostile world where the difficult task of rebuilding their lives 
awaits them. Castillo has managed to stay off drugs since his lost weekend. 
Nevertheless, his counselor said he cannot be sure whether Castillo will make 
it. "He's still very much a little boy," the counselor said. 
</P>
<P>
A FEW DAYS after Castillo's drug relapse, Impact counselors heard that Sim also 
might be in trouble. Under terms of his probation, he was required to undergo 
periodic drug tests. The latest one came back "dirty." He hadn't used, he 
insisted to the unsympathetic lab technician who had heard such denials all too 
often. Later that evening, Sim went with his troubles to the small group 
gathered for the weekly N.A. meeting in Koreatown. Sim had gotten the group off 
the ground about a month earlier. From the dozen recovering addicts there, Sim 
received words of encouragement and hugs. They believed him. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Sim, further analysis eventually determined that the traces of 
morphine that turned up in his urine sample were from a new medication 
prescribed for a stomach ailment. He breathed a sigh of relief. Although it 
seemed to Sim that life continued to throw him curve balls, he kept going to 
the weekly Koreatown N.A. meetings. "It gives me hope," he said. For once in 
his life, he did not feel alone. But counselors at Impact worried that he was 
focusing too much attention on the group he had started while neglecting to 
attend any others. Missing nightly sessions, considered critical for 
outpatients, was not a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Suzan Kidd moved back to her grandmother's home to be with her 
children. Although she had completed the program, Impact counselors were 
concerned. Not only did they consider it an evasion of personal responsibility, 
but they also knew she wasn't ready to care for her children. On the phone, she 
sounded dispirited and distant, her counselors said. They could feel her 
slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
She had lost touch with her N.A. sponsor and had begun weaving the addict's 
familiar web of deception, her counselors said. She told everybody her 
probation officer had ordered her to move when, in fact, it had been her 
choice. One counselor was not optimistic: "Sometimes people relapse before they 
get loaded. She may not be loaded now, but she's heading in that direction." By 
early May, Kidd's phone had been disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
To everyone's surprise, John Mitchell, who dropped out of the program just a 
few days before he was scheduled to begin outpatient treatment, stayed clean 
for a while. In his mind, he had received what he wanted from the program and 
was ready to continue on his own. He had moved in with his surviving daughter 
and, against the advice of Impact counselors, had gone to work as a truck 
driver. Although there was no lack of opportunity to use drugs at the truck 
stops he frequented, he said, he had the courage to resist. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell also said he remained involved in Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous. 
But counselors were skeptical, citing Mitchell's tendency toward 
self-deception. And last month, he disappeared. His daughter said he left for 
work one day and never came back. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Williams was said to be living in Venice and was seen regularly at N.A. 
meetings. Those who saw her said she sounded excited about her new life. She 
was working as a house painter and planning on returning to school to study 
art, a lifelong dream. 
</P>
<P>
But she had decided to quit sharing her innermost life with a reporter. "I'm 
tired of being a junkie and of people relating to me as a dope fiend," she 
said. "I want to put that (Lynn) to rest. I'll always have ex-junkies around me 
because I need their support. But I want to have a normal life and some day be 
around normal people who don't necessarily know all about my past." Counselors 
understood her attitude but considered it another form of denial, one of their 
biggest enemies. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Allen graduated from the program and stayed on as a full-time 
counselor-trainee. But it wasn't long before she stumbled. Not surprisingly, it 
was over sex, not drugs. It involved nothing more than a kiss. She and another 
male counselor crossed Impact's strict line between friendship and 
fraternization. As the more senior staffer, the man was immediately fired. 
Karen was allowed to stay but was ordered to resume therapy and delve further 
into her need for male attention. "I've depended on men my whole life to make 
me feel good," she said, sounding contrite. "I hope I can change." 
</P>
<P>
Like the others, Allen knows she has only begun on the long road to recovery. 
Impact provided her a road map and some tools. The rest is up to her. "I don't 
know what tomorrow will bring," she said. "All I can say is that I can stay 
clean for today and make it through another day."

DESPITE THE STILL-RAGING CIVIL WAR, A BRAVE BAND OF SALVADORAN REFUGEES GOES 
HOME

</HEADLINE>

<P>
THE CONVOY of more than five-score trucks rumbles through the barbed-wire gates 
of the Colomoncagua refugee camp in Honduras. It is February, 1990, and this is 
about the 10th group to depart in the past month. Those remaining behind line 
the roadway for the joyful, albeit tense, leave-taking, waving and wishing good 
fortune to loved ones and neighbors; their time to follow will come soon. All 
face danger and uncertainty. At a time when some troubled countries have moved 
toward peace, theirs is still a war zone where civilians often lose their 
lives. But all had decided to take this critical step together. 
</P>
<P>
The great majority of the vehicles' occupants are women and children. Their 
sense of expectation, and of strain, mount with every bumpy kilometer along the 
unpaved road, much of which has been cut specifically for the trip. It is the 
first time in almost a decade that most of them have been outside the camp's 
fenced-in compound; many of the children have never set foot on soil that was 
not part of the refugee camp. The convoy moves slowly south toward the border, 
leaving Honduras and exile behind in the choking dust of the Central American 
dry season. At long last, this group of about 600 refugees is going home -- to 
El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
They peer from the open-topped trucks as the procession chugs across the 
mountainous unmarked border and through parched hills now ablaze from recent 
rocket attacks by gunships. They pass within sight of the bombed-out town of 
San Fernando and push through the graffiti-glazed, bullet-pocked ruins of 
Perquin, a once-elegant coffee-growing center. A lone guerrilla sentry, an 
AK-47 automatic rifle slung from his shoulder, sits in the shade of a pastel 
storefront and observes with mild interest the column winding through the 
narrow, cobblestoned streets of this rebel stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
Farther south, past formerly thriving coffee plantations now gone to weeds, the 
trucks drive by the turnoff to the village of Arambala, once home to more than 
1,000 people, now an eerie ghost town, frozen in time. The church of San 
Bartolo is a caved-in hulk of whitewashed debris, strangled by vegetation; only 
its bell tower stands. The other structure intact is an unadorned entryway to 
the municipal cemetery, where the last marked grave is dated 1979 -- the year 
in which the war began and the luxury of traditional burials vanished. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after seven hours of travel, having covered only 30 kilometers, the 
dust-laden trucks lumber toward their final destination: a new and bustling 
settlement in a depopulated place called Meanguera, in the northeastern 
province of Morazan. 
</P>
<P>
Though most of the villages in this part of El Salvador are gone, the people at 
last have come home. 
</P>
<P>
THOSE IN THE CORTEGE view the region as the promised land, a place where they 
can start over, this time as a united community, educated and skilled, not as 
petrified peasants fleeing warfare. "Where do we want to go?" they had chanted 
jointly on countless occasions before their homecoming. "Meanguera, Morazan!" 
had been the reply. The resettled zones were selected, refugee leaders say, 
because the areas are close to the refugees' places of origin and provide ample 
arable land. Repeated delays and obstacles -- most associated with the 
continued warfare -- had failed to dash their hopes. And, now, with reality 
finally overtaking the dream, there is a palpable aura of exhilaration as they 
alight from the trucks beneath the searing winter sun. At the makeshift 
settlement in Meanguera, busy with construction, the 5,000 who have arrived in 
previous weeks greet the newcomers. The community band sings ballads of hope as 
tearful embraces are exchanged. With this group, more than half of the 8,400 
returning are home. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I am back, I feel a sense of tranquility," says Clemencia Hernandez, 
at 77 the matriarch of four generations of returning refugees, as she rocks the 
youngest, 9-month-old Elvin Alexis, in a homespun hammock stretched between two 
laurel trees. Elvin and two siblings were born in Honduras. The family is 
originally from a nearby hamlet, perhaps four kilometers away from the 
resettled zone. "After all this time away, the fear has left me," she says, her 
wrinkled hands caressing the youngster's sleeping body. "I have faith that God 
will be here again with us." 
</P>
<P>
More than a decade of civil war has left El Salvador a sad and haunting place. 
Few families have escaped the conflict unscathed. Most of the estimated 75,000 
dead were civilians, as are the returning refugees. The war has wrecked the 
economy, sparking an exodus of biblical proportions from the densely populated 
nation -- perhaps 5.5 million live in an area slightly larger than 
Massachusetts. Some 1.5 million are believed to have fled since the combat 
began, resettling elsewhere in Central America, or escaping to such 
destinations as Mexico, the United States, Canada and Europe. (Los Angeles has 
the largest concentration of Salvadoran expatriates, who arrive daily.) Within 
El Salvador, about half a million are desplazado -- displaced by warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Against this dismal backdrop, the convoy that enters Morazan province from 
Honduras offers some small promise. The refugees and their supporters see their 
return as a chance for things finally to be different in El Salvador. The 
exiles returning to Morazan province are the largest -- and most singular -- 
group among some 20,000 war refugees who have come back in the past few years. 
Most are from the northern provinces, including Morazan, which the military 
deemed sympathetic to the growing guerrilla insurgency. Before 1984, when 
internal and international pressures led to a few reforms, the army conducted a 
"scorched-earth" counterinsurgency campaign -- bombing, strafing and razing 
villages in zones where the rebels were active, according to residents, human 
rights activists and church officials. (Government officials claim that much of 
the damage was caused by "subversives" or during battles between rebels and 
soldiers.) 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Salvadoran military and government officials routinely charge the 
ex-refugees with having guerrilla connections. There have been military attacks 
in other areas where returning refugees have settled. The people in northern 
Morazan, while clearly not admirers of the government, express neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want," says Carolina Diaz, "is to work for peace in our country." 
</P>
<P>
A lively, spirited woman of 30, Diaz relates the type of story told with 
almost-numbing frequency here. On Feb. 22, 1980, while she was away from home, 
she says, a plainclothes gunman burst into her living room and murdered her 
mother and sister. The then-embryonic war had already claimed the lives of her 
two older brothers, who were involved in anti-government protests, she says. 
She, her father and her son, Alexis, then 4, fled to Honduras; later, she 
helped guide others over the border. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all feel a great joy to have come back; back not as refugees but as 
an independent people who are united and seek to work," Diaz explains as she 
sits in the shade of one of the newly constructed dwellings. "Being here as a 
community makes me remember the great festivals that we had in my village. The 
boys played football on the weekends and everyone watched and the vendors would 
sell fruit drinks and ices. Maybe someday it will be like that for the kids 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Repatriates now reside in a score of communities where the war continues to 
rage. Northern Morazan, like other areas of conflict, is still a guerrilla 
stronghold. The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN, as it is known 
by its Spanish acronym) patrols openly and claims it bases its clandestine 
broadcasts of Radio Venceremos in the province, which is named after a 
19th-Century champion of a united Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have resumed between the government and the rebel front; a series 
of talks have been held in Mexico, Venezuela and other countries in recent 
months. There are some hopes for a cease-fire before the end the year, but 
currently the fighting continues, the civilian death toll mounts, and residents 
live with the constant threat of another major rebel offensive, like the one 
that cost several thousand lives last November. There is no government but the 
military north of the Rio Torola, which bisects the province. The bridge 
spanning the river, a lifeline to the area, lies in a twisted heap, the victim 
of guerrilla sabotage, a symbol of the area's apartness, and its ruin. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the realities of war, the refugees exude confidence. United, they are a 
different people from the helpless campesinos who fled their country in terror. 
In Honduras, the exiles achieved an extraordinary degree of self-sufficiency 
and organization. They created communal farms and a wide array of factories and 
workshops, producing everything from clothing and shoes to furniture and 
kitchenware. Cadres of international volunteers taught them a variety of 
skills. The literacy rate zoomed from 15% in 1980 to 85% in a decade, and soon 
the camp was full of health workers, midwives, teachers, tailors and 
shoemakers. 
</P>
<P>
Their ability to overcome such great odds has left many hopeful that their 
mission will succeed, even within the grim tableau that is El Salvador. "If 
anyone can do it, I think these people can," says Father Dennis Leder, a Jesuit 
from New Jersey who was the community's parish priest for the past four years 
in Honduras. Leder spoke after celebrating an open-air Sunday-morning Mass in 
the settlement. "For most of us, the idea of sacrifice is something very 
banal," he says. "But here, sacrifice cost these people nine years of their 
lives; it cost the lives of their loved ones. There'll be ways of surmounting 
the difficulties, and I believe they will find them." 
</P>
<P>
Their accomplishments have not gone unnoticed by those in power: Both sides in 
the war have attempted to score propaganda points from the resettlement. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the conditions that provoked the flight of these fellow 
countrymen have disappeared," Vice President Francisco Merino Lopez stated 
during an interview at the ornate presidential palace in San Salvador. "The El 
Salvador that these people knew of 9 or 10 years ago is no longer the same El 
Salvador. There has been a process of democratization. . . . The armed forces 
are more and more professional." 
</P>
<P>
But the war is never far away. Children in the resettled area quickly learn to 
recognize the percussion of bombs dropped by Salvadoran military A-37 Dragonfly 
jets, overflights by fast-moving reconnaissance aircraft, the whoosh of Gatling 
guns and rockets, the crackle of automatic-weapons fire from ground-based 
troops. Rumors frequently sweep through the community warning of impending 
offensives by the army or the guerrillas. In February, rebels encamped nearby 
requested through intermediaries that residents respect a curfew, apparently 
necessitated by evening movements of insurgent troops. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the air of optimism, many villages look like the aftermath of a 
holocaust. In Perquin, townsfolk inhabit the skeletons of adobe homes. The 
gaping remains of the once-graceful city hall are scrawled over with the 
often-bloodcurdling graffiti of two armies, particularly the proclamations 
bearing the names of crack Salvadoran military units that have occupied the 
town. "Great Mother Death" screeches one message scribbled on a wall that 
appears to be spattered with blood. Nearby, someone has drawn a 
skull-and-crossbones, an arrow piercing the skull. "No sacrifice is too great 
for our motherland," states a slogan penned next to the logo of the military's 
elite Atlacatl Batallion. Military posters offer bounties to FMLN fighters who 
turn in their weapons -- almost $300 for AK-47s, $200 for rocket launchers, 
$140 for U.S.-made M-16 rifles, the most common armament. "Your rights will be 
respected," the poster advises. The guerrillas, meantime, urge soldiers to 
escape "humiliation" and "exploitation" and join the rebels. "We will fight 
together against the rich," the FMLN proclaims.

IT WASN'T UNTIL early last year that the refugees' leaders seriously considered 
repatriation. The exiles were tired of living under the supervision of 
often-antagonistic Honduran soldiers vigilant against FMLN infiltration. After 
the election of the rightist Alfredo Cristiani to the presidency of El Salvador 
in 1989, the refugees decided that it was pointless to expect the political 
climate to improve. In June, 1989, a decision was made to return. All went back 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to die, we'd rather die in our own land, with honor," says Jose 
Hernandez, 62. "(In the camp) we were like birds in a cage. Even a cage of gold 
is still a cage," says Hernandez, who cares for the herd of goats that were his 
charges in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
His task is one of countless responsibilities in the returned exiles' communal 
society. Committees, representing such broad needs as farming, building and 
shoe-making, orchestrate the different projects; residents choose or are 
assigned their tasks based on skill and interest. The group has ambitious plans 
to set up farming collectives and a network of free schools, clinics and 
day-care centers. They want to create high-volume factories where goods -- such 
as shoes, clothing and hammocks -- will be manufactured for their own use and 
for trade. This from a people who didn't use money during most of the last 
decade. Advocating free-market principles, they say they will sell to the 
military and guerrillas alike. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot to do," says Andres Antonio Amaya, 47, who spoke as he sought 
his belongings from a mountain of crates, furniture and other items trucked 
over from Honduras. "The experience of the camp has transformed me," he says, 
adding that he hopes to develop the sewing and tailoring skills he learned in 
Honduras. "There is a great satisfaction in work." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the refugees will be able -- even permitted -- to succeed remains a 
central question. They face enormous obstacles, key among them the feeding and 
maintenance of a community in an area completely lacking infrastructure. The 
region has no good roads, no running water, no electric power and no telephone 
service. The United Nations and various international relief organizations have 
pledged to help, but they cannot do it all. The U.N. did pick up the $1-million 
tab for the large-scale repatriation, a relatively inexpensive price for 
transportation, land and road clearing and start-up funds of $50 for each 
adult, $25 for each child. Until crops can be harvested, the resettled 
villagers rely on donated food. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, the Salvadoran government has vowed to cooperate and has even offered 
to reconstruct the bridge spanning the Rio Torola, a critical supply link. But 
the war has left little surplus for new projects in this nation of blown-up 
bridges, downed power lines and fallow fields. And, privately, officials of the 
Salvadoran government and military -- along with U.S. authorities -- express 
considerable wariness about the refugees, viewing their return as part of a 
master plan by the rebels to increase logistic support. 
</P>
<P>
"We know they (the returning exiles) are influenced by the subversives," Lt. 
Col. Omar Arturo Vaqueramo Quintanilla says on a February afternoon as he 
reviews new recruits in the plaza of San Francisco Gotera. Located 25 
kilometers south of Meanguera, it is the provincial capital of Morazan and the 
base of all military operations. The military wanted the refugees to resettle 
in more secure zones south of Rio Torola, but the exiles insisted on going back 
to their places of origin. 
</P>
<P>
The colonel stands ramrod straight observing maneuvers taking place in front of 
the storybook century-and-a-half-old church, incongruously situated next to the 
squat, camouflage-green headquarters. The military structure is topped with a 
massive satellite dish and emblazoned with the motto: "No mission is 
impossible." The plaza area is itself a military zone; edgy troops stand behind 
piled-up sandbags. "These people are masses," Vaqueramo says of the returned 
refugees. "The masses are easily swayed. We, too, can influence them." 
</P>
<P>
The following day, in a battered home in the rebel stronghold of Jocoaitique, a 
heavily damaged town perhaps 35 kilometers north of San Francisco, three FMLN 
representatives meet with a reporter and deny any control over the returnees. 
"There's no question that the government will resort to increasing repression 
of these people, charging that they are linked to the 'terrorists,' meaning 
us," says Rosendo, a 40-year-old guerrilla leader, over a cup of warm chocolate 
and a plate of cookies. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, other resettlements have faced serious problems, including delays in 
receiving documentation, shipments of food, building materials and other 
supplies that soldiers confiscated, claiming the goods were destined for the 
rebels. Then there is the fighting. On Feb. 11, Salvadoran gunships launched a 
rocket attack against suspected guerrilla positions in a resettled community in 
the province of Chalatenango. Five civilians, four of them children, were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
"The military always makes false allegations that dislocated people have 
collaborated with the guerrillas," says Reina Isabel Hernandez, a 29-year-old 
San Salvador resident and former refugee. She heads the Committee of Refugees 
and Displaced Persons of El Salvador. "The motive (of the military) is always 
to justify acts of violence against these people." 
</P>
<P>
She spoke following a Mass in San Salvador honoring the five dead civilians. 
The service was held in a chapel named for assassinated former Archbishop Oscar 
Arnulfo Romero, on the grounds of the Jesuit-run University of Central America 
Jose Simeon Canas. The chapel is perhaps 100 feet from the site where, in 
November, armed men murdered six Jesuit scholars, a housekeeper and her 
daughter. Among the priests killed was Segundo Montes, the prolific chronicler 
of the Salvadoran exodus, who championed the cause of the refugees in Honduras. 
In March, the settlement in Meanguera was named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
AT SEGUNDO MONTES, work begins before dawn. Women grind U.S.-donated corn and 
fashion tortillas in huge kitchen areas, men saw wood, children carry bamboo to 
be used in building. Everywhere, people attempt to reconstruct their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always worked with maguey, just as my father did before me," explains 
Santos Perez Hernandez, 58, as he scouts the banks of the Rio Torola in search 
of sites for cultivating the plant, whose fleshy leaves yield sisal, a fiber 
used to make rope and hammocks. (The plant is better known for tequila, which 
is distilled from it.) Although Perez worked in a shoe factory in the camp, he 
is eager to return to farming and teach the skills to his sons, age 14 and 11. 
"In camp, the young ones didn't have a chance to learn to farm; we only had a 
little land," Perez says, showing a visitor the knife used for cutting maguey. 
</P>
<P>
The repopulated zone of northern Morazan has been divided into four separate 
communities consisting of about 2,100 persons each. The settlements are spread 
over a 10-kilometer stretch straddling the area's main north-south road. Until 
permanent homes can be built -- wood and other materials are shipped from the 
camp in Honduras -- residents have been living in temporary structures 
fashioned from whatever is available. Initially, organizers decided that 
building dwellings and a water-supply system was priority. But a three-month 
delay -- caused by the rebel offensive last November -- set back plans to plant 
crops, mostly corn and beans, by spring. "It has been more complicated than we 
thought," acknowledges Aquilino Hernandez, a 50-year-old father of seven who is 
one of the resettlement planners. "Yes, we need help now, but we feel that in 
five years we'll be a self-sufficient community. Here, we are obliged to start 
all over again." 
</P>
<P>
The first months back in El Salvador also have been a time to renew 
acquaintances and visit old haunts. Sometimes the reminders are less than 
joyful. 
</P>
<P>
On their first Sunday back in El Salvador, Jose Isaias Ventura, 47, and his 
wife, Maxima Lainez, 35, return to Jocoaitique to view the remains of the 
mud-brick home from which they and their five children had fled in late 1980. 
"Of course, it's a great sadness for me to see this place in such condition," 
Ventura says as he steps through the former living quarters; the roof is gone, 
the beams charred and the floor overgrown with weeds. Residents later tell him 
that soldiers had destroyed all the houses in the area. Coffee plants and 
avocado trees, once his father's pride, now grow untended. All that remains 
intact is a stone used to grind corn. "One remembers where one used to work, to 
play with the children. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura recognizes that he is lucky -- he survived. A younger brother was shot 
dead in October, 1980, as he worked in a nearby field of maguey, Ventura says; 
a gunship sprayed the area with bullets. His cousin, Cleofus Martinez, had the 
misfortune to live almost alongside the main road, allowing him little time to 
escape an army patrol. "They took him away one day," Ventura says of his 
cousin. "We never found him again." 
</P>
<P>
The search for the missing drew Roberto Argueta, who has spent much of the last 
decade in Guatemala, to the new settlement. Argueta held out a slim hope that 
his wife, Dolores, the couple's daughter and his mother might be among those 
returning from Honduras. A truck driver, Argueta said he had last seen his 
family 10 years ago, when he left his village to haul a load of bananas. When 
he returned, he says, he found the village destroyed and all the inhabitants 
gone. "Really, I have very little hope that they may still be alive," Argueta 
says, his tear-filled eyes betraying his despair. "I don't know what kind of 
animals would kill helpless people. I just can't comprehend it.' 
</P>
<P>
These horrific stories of the war are recounted over and over by the returning 
refugees and their relatives in northern Morazan. Probably the most infamous 
incident in the region occurred in December, 1981, when Salvadoran troops 
attached to the U.S.-trained Atlacatl Battalion (later implicated in the 1989 
murder of the Jesuits in San Salvador) killed at least 733 civilians in and 
around the hamlet of El Mozote, according to Americas Watch, the human rights 
monitoring group. A few weeks later, journalists made their way on foot into 
isolated El Mozote and found the carnage. Inside the church sacristy, wrote 
Alma Guillermoprieto in the Washington Post on Jan. 7, 1982, "the stench was 
overpowering, and countless bits of bones -- skulls, rib cages, femurs, a 
spinal column -- poked out of the rubble." 
</P>
<P>
One of the few known survivors of the massacre, Rufina Amaya, returned to El 
Salvador in January from the refugee camp. Amaya, an imposing, strong-willed 
woman of 48, lost her four children, aged 8 months to 9 years, in the massacre. 
She managed to slip away while she was among a group of women being herded into 
a storefront to be shot. After crawling out of the village, she says, she lived 
in caves and in the brush for a year before making her way to Honduras and 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Amaya, who has become a kind of oral historian of the massacre, says she has no 
fear about being back in her homeland. "I feel that the blood of my children 
will be a strength for us all," says Amaya, who has a 4-year-old daughter, 
Marta, born in Honduras. "We want peace and liberty in El Salvador. We know the 
difficulties continue. But my children were killed, and it would be cowardice 
on my part if I lacked the strength to confront those problems."

COOKING WITH fruit is relatively uncommon in this country. With the exception 
of applesauce, fruit rarely appears before dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Confining fruit to the finale in this way reflects a peculiarly American 
prejudice; the Moroccans, for example, stew poultry with prunes, the Armenians 
put apricots into pilaf, and the Indians and Chinese make condiments out of 
mangoes, peaches and plums. Perhaps the only explanation for our parochial 
approach to meal planning is that the people who most profoundly influenced 
American cooking came from countries where the only fruit enjoyed at supper was 
the grape -- served pressed and fermented. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever its roots, this bias has deprived us, particularly with regard to 
fruit soups. Savored in places as diverse as Denmark (apple soup), Hungary 
(cherry soup) and Senegal (banana), fruit soups simply haven't caught on here. 
</P>
<P>
In the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in 
America in Cambridge, Mass., one of the nation's largest public culinary 
collections, the earliest fruit soup recipe appears in "Mrs. S. T. Rorer's 20 
Quick Soups," dated 1894. It's a questionable concoction of currants that are 
soaked, mashed, pressed through a sieve and thickened with arrowroot. The 
original edition of "The Fannie Farmer Cookbook," the definitive American 
cookbook, has no recipes for fruit soups, although a few of Farmer's 
fruit-punch formulas seem similar to some of the recipes featured in Olive 
Green's 1907 collection, "1,999 Simple Soups." Green shows a preference for 
spirited soups -- fruit juices laced with sherry, claret or liqueur -- 
demonstrating that the distinction between fruit punch and soup can be left to 
the cook's discretion and may ultimately depend on whether it's served with a 
spoon or a swizzle stick. 
</P>
<P>
When the texture and flavors are as rich as what follows, there's no doubt that 
"soup" applies. A broth of dried fruit, soaked and pureed in fruit juice, 
provides a flavorful base for these two seasonal first courses. 
</P>
<P>
STRAWBERRY SOUP 
</P>
<P>
16 ounces unfiltered apple juice4 dried peaches1 pint strawberries, washed, 
hulled and sliced 1/2 cup plain yogurt or buttermilk1 tablespoon lemon 
juiceSliced strawberries, for garnish1 tablespoon lemon zest, for garnish Soak 
dried peaches in apple juice for at least 3 hours or overnight in refrigerator. 
Transfer to nonreactive medium saucepan, and simmer gently until peaches turn 
mushy and juice thickens, about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Puree strawberries in blender or food processor. Add juice and peaches, and 
blend until smooth. Add yogurt or buttermilk and blend again. Chill for at 
least 3 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Just before serving, stir in lemon juice. Garnish with additional sliced 
strawberries and a sprinkle of lemon zest. Makes 4-6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
APRICOT SOUP 
</P>
<P>
16 ounces orange juice4 dried apricots1 bay leaf1/4 cup chopped mild red onion1 
pound fresh apricots2/3 cup half-and-halfGround nutmegGround ginger Soak dried 
apricots in orange juice 3 hours or overnight in refrigerator. Transfer to 
nonreactive medium saucepan, and add bay leaf and onion. Simmer gently until 
onion turns mushy, about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Bring large pot of water to boil, and plunge in fresh apricots for about 15 
seconds or until skins slip off easily. Skin and pit the apricots, transfer to 
blender or food processor and puree. 
</P>
<P>
Remove bay leaf from orange juice mixture, and add juice to apricot puree. 
Blend until smooth. Add half-and-half and blend again. Chill at least 3 hours. 
Just before serving, stir in a pinch each of nutmeg and ginger. Makes 4-6 
servings.

Without it they are limited in opportunity, isolated in anunreal, small world,

I greatly appreciated your article, "The Grande Dame of Gay Liberation," by 
Bruce Shenitz (June 10). People like Evelyn Hooker should be commended for 
their advocacy on behalf of gays and lesbians -- groups that suffer from 
extreme oppression in our society. We, as a society and as individuals, must 
accept homosexuality in other people as well as in ourselves if we are to ever 
view gays and lesbians as worthy and normal.

LONG before Malibu was a colony to its current elite citizenry, the area was 
the home of the Chumash Indians (for a couple of thousand years, through the 
early 1700s). Just north of the Malibu Pier is Malibu Lagoon State Beach, the 
site of a variety of interesting things to see and do -- for children and 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
The wetland habitat, where freshwater meets saltwater, serves as a fish nursery 
as well as a migratory stop -- part of the Pacific Flyway -- for birds 
traveling south from Alaska to Mexico each winter. Displays at the entrance 
provide an introduction to the creatures found in the tide pools and the birds 
and sea life that inhabit the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
The Malibu Lagoon Museum houses exhibits documenting the history of the area's 
dwellers. In August, "Surf's Up" takes a look at the popular local sport, 
beginning with its early days when George Freeth used an eight-foot-long, 
200-pound board. The Adamson House (pictured), the lovely 1929 Moorish-Spanish 
Colonial Revival-style home adjacent to the museum, showcases the lavish use of 
tiles produced by Malibu Potteries between 1926 and 1932, including a 
20-foot-long tile replica of a Persian rug. The pool, adjoining bathhouse, 
fountains and walkways throughout the 13-acre beachfront grounds also are 
decorated with tile. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, National Park Service, 
(818) 597-9192, presents bird-watching walks, hikes and other programs. And the 
Palisades-Malibu YMCA hosts Nursery Nature Walks for children through age 5 and 
accompanying adults. Group leaders describe the lagoon as a nursery where 
important baby fish and plants grow and introduce birds and a rabbit run for 
observation. There's plenty of hands-on exploration, singing and general 
lagoon-type fun. For information about dates and times, telephone (213) 
454-5591. 
</P>
<P>
"Babes at the Beach," a program of the William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom 
that will resume in September, takes children 2 1/2 years and up and their 
parents on a 1 1/2-hour low-tide hike around the lagoon and tide pools. 
Reservations are required; for dates and times, telephone (213) 858-3834.

The Padres, Lord only knows, have had their share of zany weeks since the 
inception of this franchise. 
</P>
<P>
They've had managers quitting on the opening day of spring training camps. 
They've had presidents wagging the wrong finger on Fan Appreciation Day. 
They've had son-in-laws come and go as Padre officers. They've had owners 
berating their team on the public-address system. They've had players 
ridiculing owners' hamburgers. They've had players taking out ads in newspapers 
applying for part-time work. They've had. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You get the picture . . . the Padres have not exactly been your quietest, most 
serene franchise in the baseball world. 
</P>
<P>
So when the Padres say that Saturday night's 5-3 defeat to the Houston Astros 
concludes one of the wackiest weeks in their history, man, that's really saying 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it's the craziest," Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn said, "but 
it's got to rank right up there." 
</P>
<P>
Where else can you have a team open its week on Sunday by finishing its worst 
trip on the road (1-10) since 1973, lose again Monday for their 21st time in 24 
games, and win as many games (five) in five days as it had in the previous 5 
1/2 weeks? 
</P>
<P>
Yes sir, the Padres have been so hot these days that they even have President 
Bush talking about them. 
</P>
<P>
OK, OK, so he's actually been talking about the Padres indirectly, instead 
referring to a certain national anthem singer, but at least the Padres have the 
country buzzing, right? 
</P>
<P>
The Padres even managed to look good in their defeat Saturday, which snapped 
their nine-game winning streak against the Astros at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. The crowd of 22,621 watched the Padres surge back from a 5-1 deficit 
with solo homers by Joe Carter and Tom Lampkin in the seventh, and then see the 
drama of Astro reliever Larry Andersen strike out Jack Clark in the eighth with 
Gwynn on first. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it goes down as a defeat in the standings, but when your top four hitters 
go zero for 15, little wonder Padre Manager Greg Riddoch was rather pleased 
that the game's outcome remained in jeopardy until the final out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've seen a quicker about-face than this one," Riddoch said. "I 
mean, when you're laying in bed at night trying to figure out what kinds of 
things you could do that might have an impact -- then realize that there's only 
so much you can do -- and then see the team turn around like it has, yeah, it's 
been a pretty wild week, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sure been hairy, hasn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
This is a team that went 3-21 over the past four weeks, batting .232. They were 
outscored 122-68, scoring more than three runs in only five games. And they 
plummeted 11 games in the standings to the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they've suddenly won five of six games, batting .343 with 14 doubles, two 
triples and six homers. They've scored more runs (39) in the past six games 
than they accumulated in their previous 14 games. And they've made up six games 
alone this week on the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about ending a streak," Riddoch said, "is starting another 
one." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' esprit de corps has reached such levels that even though they still 
trail the Reds by 16 games, several Padre players have actually said -- with a 
straight face, no less -- that perhaps it's not too late to catch the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch, who has heard the talk himself, scoffed at any such notion. He knows 
that no team in baseball history has ever overcome such a deficit during a 
course of a season, much less than than one with just two months left. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys have come into my office," Riddoch said, "and have told me, 'Say, look, 
we're just these many games back.' I tell them, 'Hey, come on, those are the 
kind of things that got us in trouble in the first place.' " 
</P>
<P>
But if nothing else, the Padres' outrageous optimism at least shows a 
difference in the team's attitude. It was just a week ago in St. Louis, 
remember, when first baseman Jack Clark was telling reporters, "Our goal now is 
just to stay out of last place." 
</P>
<P>
So what's the explanation? How can a team look so dreadful for so long, all of 
a sudden look like the pennant contender everyone anticipated? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you might find this hard to believe, but there's a few folks in the Padre 
clubhouse who say that the biggest reason might have been Roseanne Barr, who 
caused a national furor with Wednesday's rendition of the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it probably was the worst publicity stunt in baseball since the Chicago 
White Sox's Disco Night on July 12, 1979, that caused a near riot and resulted 
in a forfeiture of a game. And yes, when you have the President publicly 
criticizing the action, it doesn't do a whole lot of good for your public 
image. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the words of Padre starter Bruce Hurst, "I think Roseanne might have 
been the best thing to happen to us. She took the spotlight off us. It was like 
all of the pressure came off us, and onto her, bless her heart." 
</P>
<P>
There, of course, were plenty of other explanations provided for the Padres' 
resurgence: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hurst's two-hit shutout Tuesday in a 10-0 victory over the Reds: "We got 
two runs in the first with two out," Hurst said, "and I remember saying in the 
dugout, 'Come on, now let's don't let them back in it. And we didn't. We just 
manhandled them." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shortstop Garry Templeton's diving stab in the first game of a doubleheader 
Wednesday that preserved the Padres' 2-1 victory over Cincinnati: "When you 
make plays like that, it gears teams up, and that's what happened to us. We 
took off from there. It was like all of the great qualities of this team came 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The emergence of Jack Clark and Joe Carter: During the past six games, they 
have combined for five homers and 13 RBIs. "When you've got those guys going," 
Riddoch said, "you start seeing a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
It's unknown now whether the Padres' surge will have a bearing in the 
decision-making of Jack McKeon, Padre vice president/baseball operations. He 
was on the phone all afternoon Saturday talking with at least five general 
managers, and spent the game talking with Chicago Cub scout Hugh Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
You can be assured they weren't rating the best and worst National Anthem 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to see what happens," Riddoch said. "Knowing Trader, a lot of 
things could happen in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
"Your guess is as good as mine." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
You think Roseanne Barr had a bad performance at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium? 
Hey, take a good, hard look at the Astros. Since the start of the 1987 season, 
the Astros are 7-26 here, and have been outscored, 178-88. Their victory 
Saturday was their first at San Diego since Aug. 8, 1989 in which they were 
outscored 69-17. It also was the first time in six games this season at Jack 
Murphy that the Astros scored more than two runs in a game. They had scored two 
runs in each of their first five games. . . . Astro starter Mike Scott (8-10) 
allowed six hits and three runs in seven innings for the victory. Scott, who is 
in the second year of a three-year, $6.6 million contract, has been rumored for 
weeks to be headed elsewhere, and with the trading deadline scheduled at 2 p.m. 
(PST) Tuesday when players must again clear waivers, Scott could be headed to 
any of the pennant contenders. The biggest stumbling block, however, is that 
Scott is a five-and-10-year man, and can veto any trade. . . . The Philadelphia 
Phillies continue to scout Jack Clark, and rumors persist of a possible package 
that might include Ricky Jordan. Also in attendance Saturday were scouts from 
Kansas City and the Chicago White Sox. . . . Padre starter Bruce Hurst returned 
to the team Saturday after spending the past two days at home with the flu. 
Hurst, who lost seven pounds, was not able to eat solid food without getting 
sick until Saturday when he had a sandwich. "I've been throwing up, and at the 
same time had diarrhea. It was not a pretty sight." Hurst still is scheduled to 
pitch at 1:05 p.m. today in the series' final against the Astros, but the 
Padres will not make a decision until today. "I'll give it everything I can," 
Hurst said. "I still think I can go." . . . Jack Clark was fined by National 
League President Bill White, but not suspended, for his ejection last Sunday in 
St. Louis. The amount of the fine was not revealed by the National League 
office, or the Padres. . . . Hope the boss has a good sense of humor: Manager 
Greg Riddoch put a sticker on his file cabinet Saturday that reads: "I like 
this job so much, I'd do it for nothing. (Unfortunately, they know that)." Tom 
Lampkin, the Padre rookie backup catcher, continues to dazzle the Padre 
front-office with his skills. He not only is batting .308 (eight for 25) since 
his arrival July 11, hitting his first career homer Saturday, but has thrown 
out four of six baserunners attempting to steal. He added Mark Davidson to his 
list in the second inning, after already throwing out Vince Coleman, Willie 
McGee and Ozzie Smith of the St. Louis Cardinals. "We're really been impressed 
with his ability, and what he's done for us," Riddoch said. "He hasn't been in 
awe of the situation or surroundings one bit. . . . Padre catcher Benito 
Santiago -- who has been on the disabled list since June 14 -- might be able to 
resume playing at the end of the Padres' next trip on Aug. 12, Riddoch said. 
"To hurry him at this point would be counter-productive," Riddoch said. "We're 
going to let him go at his pace." . . . Mark Davis' problems with the Kansas 
City Royals continue on. Davis, who won a Cy Young award for the Padres last 
season before leaving for a four-year, $13 million contract, made his second 
start of the season Saturday: four innings, six hits, six earned runs, seven 
walks and a strikeout. . . . Dora Duensing, the wife of Padre assistant trainer 
Larry Duensing, gave birth this week to their second daughter, Laura Elizabeth. 
Still on hold are Wendy Parent, the wife of catcher Mark Parent, and Pam Dunne, 
the wife of pitcher Mike Dunne. Each are scheduled to give birth in the next 
few days.

BERNSTINE WANTS TO TAKE HIS LUMPS; 
</P>
<P>
CHARGERS: HE HAS TO PROVE HE CAN STAY IN ONE PIECE.

<P>
The biggest play Charger running back Rod Bernstine made in a scrimmage the 
other day had nothing to do with running, catching or blocking. It was all 
about showing just how tough he really is. In the violent world of professional 
football, this is pretty important stuff. 
</P>
<P>
He was knocked woozy by a Ram defender after catching a pass and slumped to the 
ground. But he quickly righted himself and left the field. One play later, he 
was back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He was groggy," Coach Dan Henning said. "There would have been no questions if 
he had taken himself out, because he was staggered. But he jumped back in, not 
only jumped back in, but did some things that make you believe he is trying to 
disprove popular perception." 
</P>
<P>
That perception is one Henning himself helped promote last August during 
training camp at UC San Diego when he questioned Bernstine's determination to 
come back from knee surgery eight months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernstine comes back when Bernstine wants to come back," Henning said then, 
biting off each word. "As long as Bernstine feels like he's not ready to go, 
then he won't be coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine did return in time for the first game, but four weeks later, he 
sprained the same knee at Denver and missed the rest of the season. Again there 
came questions about his durability. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine says he remembered that as he struggled to reorient himself against 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"As I was turning around, a guy hit me right in the ear drum," Bernstine said. 
"It threw off my sense of balance. I really didn't know where I was at. The 
coach didn't want me to go back in, but I did. I was eager to show I could take 
a hit and keep playing." 
</P>
<P>
Hard to imagine that anyone would question the toughness of a 25-year-old 
professional athlete who stands 6-feet-3, weighs 238 pounds and averaged a 
first down every time he touched the ball last season. But it happened, and it 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"If a guy is hurt on and off for two years, he gets a knock like that," 
Bernstine said. "I really don't think anyone around here feels I'm not a strong 
person who doesn't want to get on the field. But sometimes you have to say 
things to get a guy motivated." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers tried that again after Bernstine sprained his knee last season. At 
first, the team said he would be out only for a week or two. Bernstine's strong 
start added to the optimism. 
</P>
<P>
But when he continued to complain of pain, arthroscopic surgery was ordered. 
Bernstine said a pin that had been placed in his knee during the first surgery 
had begun to come loose and had to be removed. Until then, Bernstine said, his 
complaints of pain were met with healthy skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"Pain doesn't bother me, but how can you go out and play when you can't run?" 
Bernstine said. "I couldn't even run straight without a big, major limp. To go 
out and perform on the field would have just been stupid. I would have just 
hurt it worse." 
</P>
<P>
Despite some of his earlier, less-sympathetic comments, Henning said he does 
understand Bernstine's plight and realizes now that Bernstine's complaints may 
have been more genuine then he originally was given credit for. 
</P>
<P>
"After Denver, there was a period of time when the doctors felt he had to give 
it a shot," Henning said. "He didn't feel like he was ready yet, and maybe as 
it turned out, he might have been righter than they were." 
</P>
<P>
Since he joined the Chargers in 1987 as a first-round draft pick out of Texas 
A&amp;M, Bernstine has been a topic of debate. Even his selection was 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the Chargers were stocked with three experienced tight ends, 
including Kellen Winslow. Al Saunders did not want to take a tight end, but he 
was overruled by Steve Ortmayer, director of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine's first summer with the Chargers began with usual first-rounder 
contract squabble -- a 17-day holdout. That was followed by a hamstring injury 
that kept him on injured reserve for the first five games and was the beginning 
of his injury problems. He spent the rest of his first season playing behind 
Winslow and finished with 10 catches for 76 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
When Winslow retired before the 1988 season, Bernstine took over as the 
starting tight end. All went well until the 14th week when, in a game at 
Cincinnati, he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee. Surgery was 
followed by months of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
He reported to training camp last July but was unable to pass his physical. As 
Bernstine stood and watched the first month of camp, the questions about his 
toughness began to circulate. He was not cleared to practice until 2 1/2 weeks 
before the start of the season. But once it began, Bernstine made the wait 
worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Switched to H-back and used frequently as a running back, Bernstine became the 
team's most productive two-dimensional offensive threat. In five games, he 
caught 21 passes for 222 yards and one touchdown and rushed for 137 yards and 
one touchdown on 15 carries, a 9.1-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
But that all came to end when he sprained his knee against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine said it was not until a month or so ago that he began to feel he was 
at full strength again. After his productive running last season, he has been 
switched to full-time running back. That means more cuts and moves to test his 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
"(The knee) is definitely in the back of my mind," Bernstine said. "(In the 
scrimmage) and during the week of practice, I took a couple of good hits. But 
the leg feels fine." 
</P>
<P>
Little could be better news to the Chargers, or to Bernstine. His four-year 
contract expires at the end of the season, and he knows this is the time to 
prove he can be a productive and durable player. 
</P>
<P>
"Staying healthy is the key for me," Bernstine said. "When I am healthy, I can 
perform probably with the best of them. But to keep me on the field has been 
the big problem." 
</P>

WILLIAMS WALKS OUT OF CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Defensive lineman Lee Williams, a two-time Pro Bowl starter who led the AFC in 
sacks last season, walked out of Charger training camp Saturday morning in a 
dispute over what his agent contends was a team promise to renegotiate his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and his agent, Steve Feldman of Newport Beach, took the action after a 
meeting earlier in the morning with Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard in 
which Beathard said he told them he would not renegotiate at this time, if at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has three years remaining on a five-year deal signed before the 1988 
season. The agreement will pay him approximately $700,000 this year, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're in a position that we owe an apology for this contract," 
Beathard said. "He is making a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman, who negotiated the current contract, said Williams is upset because 
Beathard will not honor a pledge Feldman said was made to them by Beathard's 
predecessor, Steve Ortmayer. Feldman said Ortmayer told them the team would 
renegotiate or extend the contract if Williams made two consecutive Pro Bowls, 
which he accomplished last season. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said that he told Beathard of this promise on several occasions over 
the past few months and warned him that Williams might take the action he did 
Saturday if Beathard did not agree to change the contract. 
</P>
<P>
"They had ample warning," Feldman said. "They knew this could happen." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said he informed Feldman he would investigate the matter but made no 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them before minicamp that I didn't know of such a promise," Beathard 
said. "I would check to see if there was such a promise. And I find no evidence 
of such a promise." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer, now an assistant coach with Raiders, said it would be inappropriate 
for him to comment since he no longer is with the Chargers. Williams could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said his position will not change regardless of Beathard's position. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter that Bobby Beathard can't find any evidence of a promise," 
Feldman said. "Lee Williams knows what he was promised. The issue isn't so much 
about money. Lee Williams is going to be well paid. He is mad that he was 
ignored. He has busted his hump for this team. He was promised something and he 
deserves it. He is hurt by this decision." 
</P>
<P>
Williams is in his seventh season with the Chargers. He has started every game 
for the past five seasons, except the three during the 1987 players' strike, 
the longest such streak on the team. 
</P>
<P>
He led AFC with a 14 sacks last season and his 58 sacks is second on the 
Charger all-time list behind Gary Johnson's 67. His 57 sacks over the past five 
seasons are the most in the AFC and fourth in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a player who obviously came into camp with the idea he was going to go 
out of camp," Coach Dan Henning said. "There are some reasons. There is some 
background that Bobby needs to get to. There has been a change in the front 
office and things that have been said in the past, maybe not in writing, have 
to be ironed out." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' walkout is the latest in a series of contract problems between the 
Chargers and Feldman, who represents several of the team's most prominent 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Two other veteran Feldman clients--cornerback Gill Byrd and free safety Vencie 
Glenn--are without contracts. Another Feldman client--first-round draft choice 
Junior Seau--is entering the 10th day of his holdout. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said he did not expect Williams' action to affect talks with Feldman 
on other players and that Feldman properly has kept separate talks on each 
player. But Henning indicated he was concerned about the team's position 
relative to Feldman. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a situation where there is an agent who controls negotiations for a 
number of the players who are out," Henning said. "Anywhere else in today's 
society, that might be considered a monopoly." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said no decision about whether to fine Williams for his absence has 
been made. Buthe doubted that it would have much impact if the team were to 
impose the maximum allowable league fine of $1,000 per day. The team also has 
the option of sending Williams a letter demanding that he report within five 
days or risk being placed on the reserve/left squad list, rendering him 
ineligible for the season. Beathard said he informed Williams it was in his 
best interest to report to practice. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker Ken Woodard checked himself into Palomar Hospital Friday for 
tests after experiencing chest pains, Coach Dan Henning said. Brandon has a 
history arythmia, Henning said. . . . There will be no morning practice today.

CONEJO VALLEY MADE IT TOUGH BUT OFTEN FOUND A WAY TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conejo Valley established a reputation for playing exciting baseball this year, 
but it wasn't always in a positive manner. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Conejo Valley's young team had a tendency to be downright sporadic, as 
it was Saturday during a 10-9 win over District 16 rival Camarillo in the third 
round of the American Legion 6th Area playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
A gallon of bleach could not have cleaned Conejo Valley's mess, but Coach Craig 
Sturges was still beaming over the opportunity to play at Jackie Robinson 
Stadium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We do some strange things out there, but you gotta love it," Sturges said. 
</P>
<P>
Sturges' heart has been in his mouth lately. His team avoided a disaster by 
inches when Jim Chergey's diving catch ended a nerve-wracking ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley took a 10-4 lead into the inning, but Camarillo (21-5), the 
District 16 champion, scored five runs -- four unearned -- courtesy of three 
Conejo Valley errors. 
</P>
<P>
"You probably saw more of that than I did, because I had my hands covering my 
eyes most of the time," Sturges said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time Conejo Valley fans had seen such unspectacular play. 
Last spring, all but one of Conejo Valley's players attended Thousand Oaks 
High. The Lancers led the Marmonte League in errors last season, still, the 
team developed a knack for come-from-behind wins. 
</P>
<P>
Garth Marcus, the Lancers' assistant coach, was at Saturday's game sporting a 
familiar grin. "TO baseball, baby," he said. Conejo Valley, a.k.a. Thousand 
Oaks, had lost three of four games to Camarillo during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley continued to employ its cardiac style in the playoffs. It came 
from behind to beat Santa Monica, 9-8, in 10 innings Thursday, and its shaky 
defense allowed Camarillo to crawl back into Saturday's contest. The magic 
ended a few hours later, however, when Woodland Hills West eliminated Conejo 
Valley, 13-8. 
</P>
<P>
"We emphasize a loose approach, but I think we played it a little too loose," 
Sturges said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's Chris Borchard, who had led off the ninth inning Saturday with a 
walk and reached third on Jon McMullen's single, scored after an error on Mike 
Mitchell's grounder. Mike Muncy's bloop single drove in two more runs and cut 
the deficit to 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley pitcher Bryan Corey, who had relieved Nick Brown, dropped a pop 
fly that would have ended the game. Then Kasha Clemons -- who had hit his 11th 
home run in the sixth -- stepped into the batter's box representing the tying 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Conejo Valley third baseman) Billy Hall that if Kasha hits a three-run 
dinger, we'll have to run over and revive Sturges," Camarillo Coach Gary Wagner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Clemons didn't homer but still gave Sturges palpitations with a long fly ball 
to right field that Glenn Marshall dropped on the warning track. The error 
allowed two more runs to score and pulled Camarillo to within 10-9. And Clemons 
stood eagerly at second base. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping for a popup, and we drop it. Then I want a fly ball, and we drop 
that," Sturges said. "Then I just didn't want them to hit it to short, where my 
son (Brian) was." 
</P>
<P>
Mitch King lofted a fly ball into short center field and Chergey, who got a 
late jump, charged and made a diving catch. Chergey, who played on the junior 
varsity at Thousand Oaks last spring, started in place of Brent Christenson and 
was three for four. Christenson, who is batting .350, missed the game in order 
to practice with the U. S. Amateur team. 
</P>
<P>
"Chergey's only a sophomore, but he had a great game," Sturges said. "We put a 
load on his shoulders, and he carried the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes, we play an exciting brand of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
McMullen, the son of former major leaguer Ken McMullen, was three for five, and 
King, Garth Teron and Muncy each had two hits for Camarillo, which was coming 
off a last-inning, 5-2 loss to Claremont on Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some tough things happen to us," Wagner said. "But this group really 
developed, and we're happy with the way they played." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lee (6-2) allowed only one run in seven innings of relief for Conejo 
Valley. Hall, David Skeels and Corey each had two hits.

<P>
AMERICAN LEGION: DEFENDING CHAMPION, WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE LOSERS' 
BRACKET, ADVANCES TO 6TH AREA FINALS.

After a first-round loss to Claremont, Woodland Hills West was faced with 
having to win five games in a row if it was to capture its second successive 
American Legion 6th Area championship and earn a berth in the state playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
And now, a determined survivor working its way through the 
one-more-loss-and-you're-out losers' bracket, West is only two games away from 
another trip to Yountville. 
</P>
<P>
West snapped back to defeat Santa Monica in the second round Friday, then took 
a doubleheader Saturday, defeating Culver City, 11-5, and Conejo Valley, 13-8, 
at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium to claim a berth in today's championship 
finals against Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont, which is undefeated in the double-elimination tournament, advanced 
with victories in the first two rounds. Should West win the 9 a.m. game today, 
a second game will be played at 3 p.m. to determine the championship. Claremont 
(38-9) won the 6th Area title in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We're confident," West Coach Don Hornback said. "We're really on a roll now. 
We're really hitting the ball. It would take a supreme pitching effort to stop 
our bats tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The statistics lend credence to Hornback's boast. West (26-5) combined for 34 
hits in both games Saturday and shelled Santa Monica for 16 on Friday, bringing 
West's 6th Area playoff total to 63 hits in four games. 
</P>
<P>
"What can you say about Woodland Hills? They hit the ball," Conejo Valley Coach 
Craig Sturges said. "You throw it high, they hit it; you throw it low, they hit 
it; you throw it behind them, they hit it." 
</P>
<P>
West cleanup hitter Jason Cohen and No. 5 hitter Bobby Kim connected often. 
Cohen, after going two for three against Culver City, ripped Conejo Valley 
pitchers Bryan Corey and Nick Brown for four hits in five at-bats and knocked 
in two runs, pushing his tournament RBI total to 11. 
</P>
<P>
Kim collected three hits in four trips to the plate and drew a walk in each 
game. He finished with four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, a catcher who played at El Camino Real High in the spring, said that after 
the Conquistadores' disappointing loss to Chatsworth in the City Section 4-A 
Division title game at Dodger Stadium, baseball didn't seem as much fun any 
more . . . until now. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the guys after (we lost at( at Dodger Stadium, I didn't think baseball 
was fun any more," Kim said. "How many times in your life can you play in 
Dodger Stadium?" 
</P>
<P>
Now, Kim &amp; Co. are on Cloud 9. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we're here at UCLA, it's just great," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
West also got solid performances from pitchers Corey Bromberg (6-1) and Terry 
Morrow (4-0). 
</P>
<P>
Against Culver City (13-3) Bromberg went the distance, striking out five while 
allowing 10 hits and three earned runs. Morrow, making his first appearance as 
a position player in six weeks after suffering a shoulder injury, surrendered 
12 hits and had five strikeouts against Conejo Valley through 8 1/3 innings. He 
yielded to Paul Geller in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley (24-11) was sparked by Brian Sturges. Sturges went three for 
three, including two doubles and five RBIs.

FIGHTING CHANCE AT STARDOM; 
</P>
<P>
TALENTED DEGRANDIS SETS TIMETABLE FOR SUCCESS AT PRO LEVEL AS A MIDDLEWEIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A boxing quiz: Name a rough and powerful middleweight boxer from Massachusetts 
who worked with the famed trainer-manager tandem of Goody and Pat Petronelli. 
</P>
<P>
If you answered Marvelous Marvin Hagler, you are correct. 
</P>
<P>
If your answer was Joey DeGrandis, you also are correct -- and, in all 
likelihood, a relative or close personal friend of DeGrandis. Few in boxing 
have heard of DeGrandis. But if words mean anything, DeGrandis just might 
become a boxing great. 
</P>
<P>
"He has all the tools," said Dan Goossen, president of the Van Nuys-based Ten 
Goose Boxing Club, which recently signed the hard-hitting DeGrandis to a 
contract. "He has a chin of rock and a very, very hard punch." 
</P>
<P>
And from the boxer himself: "In two years I expect to be ready to fight any 
middleweight in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Big talk from a 21-year-old who has fought just once as a professional and was 
forced in that bout to go the four-round distance to earn a unanimous decision 
over two-fight novice Jason Burrel of Corona. Although Burrel avoided a 
knockout, unlike most of DeGrandis' opponents in 26 amateur fights, DeGrandis 
showed in that June 26 bout at the Country Club in Reseda that he does indeed 
have a chin of stone. And heavy, thudding hands to match. 
</P>
<P>
"Geez, I croaked a lot of guys as an amateur," DeGrandis said, his Boston 
accent as thick as chowder. "And I hit this guy Burrel just as hard as any of 
'em. And he kept standing. I kept going back to my cawnah after each round 
saying to myself, 'What do I have to do to this guy?' He was tough." 
</P>
<P>
DeGrandis quickly learned what many had been telling him: Amateur boxing is as 
similar to pro boxing as a fishhook to a left hook. DeGrandis pounded his way 
to the New England Golden Gloves championship in 1988 as a middleweight then 
stepped up to the light heavyweight division and won the New England 
championship again in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
And along the way, he, in his words, croaked most of 'em. 
</P>
<P>
"But the first pro fight was so different," he said. "For one thing, I was so 
nervous before it started I was shaking. But once the bell rang I was OK. But 
this guy wouldn't go down for nothing. When it was over, it was a great 
feeling, though. But I found out that this is the major leagues. These guys are 
very serious about boxing. It wasn't always like that against guys in the 
amateurs." 
</P>
<P>
DeGrandis will make his second appearance as a pro Tuesday night at the Country 
Club when he takes on Orange County's Richard Jones, who will be making his pro 
debut, in a scheduled four-round fight. Headlining the card will be Rafael 
Ruelas of Arleta, the unbeaten featherweight who will bring an 18-0 record with 
15 knockouts into a scheduled 10-rounder against veteran Rosendo Alonso of 
Bakersfield (32-24-3). 
</P>
<P>
DeGrandis' trail across the country to the Ten Goose Boxing Club was blazed by 
an older brother, John, who cornered Goossen at a fight night at the Country 
Club in the spring and told him about Joey, who had worked out for a few months 
with the Petronellis at the same gym where they trained Hagler. 
</P>
<P>
"We get this all the time," Goossen said. "Guys coming up to me saying they 
fight or their brother fights or their uncle fights. I gave John my business 
card and said to call me in two days. Most of the time, that's the last you 
hear from them. But he called." 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, Joey made the trip, and a meeting with Goossen was arranged. 
After learning of DeGrandis' Golden Glove accomplishments, Goossen decided to 
give the kid a chance. He sent him to the Ten Goose trainer, Joe Goossen, who 
liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"Before anything else, we liked Joey," said Dan Goossen, who signed 
International Boxing Federation middleweight champion Michael Nunn and now has 
two rising boxing stars, Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas, in his camp. "He is a great 
kid, a great person. That's how we size up our prospects first. A man has to be 
a good person. We would not, however, waste anyone's time working with a very 
nice young man who had no ability to fight." 
</P>
<P>
That ability to fight came early for DeGrandis, one of four brothers in, well, 
let's say in an area of South Boston that does not have many back-yard swimming 
pools or Porsches parked in the driveways. None, at least, that are legally 
owned by the residents. 
</P>
<P>
"My brothers and me, we fought about anything," DeGrandis said. "And I had some 
street fights with other guys. I didn't always go looking for a fight. Some 
days I didn't want to fight at all. But other days I did." 
</P>
<P>
He turned to ring fighting when he was 16, and DeGrandis found that he liked 
that much more. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell in love with the sport immediately," he said. "It was just such a great 
challenge to me. I watched Sugar Ray Leonard develop into a great fighter, and 
of course there was always Marvin. I met him a few times. Once I had my New 
England Golden Gloves championship jacket on and Hagler looked at it and just 
smiled." 
</P>
<P>
Smiling, perhaps, at what he knew would be a long, perilous and painful road 
ahead for DeGrandis. But it is a road, he said, that he is willing to travel. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't always willing to do the work," he said. "I wasn't willing to get in 
the best shape. But now, with Joe Goossen, I'm ready. I get up every morning 
and run four miles and work hard the rest of the day to get in the best shape. 
Joe pushes me, but now I want to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take my time and let Joe and Dan work with me, and I'll work as hard as I 
can. And someday, sooner or later, good things will come to me and this work 
will pay off." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it would be wise not to make any unnecessary comments to 
DeGrandis about that bit of an accent he has. 
</P>
<P>
"I heah people talking about me," he said. "They say 'Bahston' and all that 
stuff. But to me, Californians sound really goofy. All this brand new carrrr 
stuff. It's a cah, that's all."

SIGMAN TAKES SAUGUS FEATURE WIRE TO WIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Gary Sigman of Carson draws the pole position in the 40-lap Sportsman main 
event at Saugus Speedway, you can pretty much go ahead and Pick Six. 
</P>
<P>
Sigman, of course, drives the No. 06 car at Saugus and, bequeathed the No. 1 
spot in a 24-car field Saturday night, he never relinquished the lead, winning 
his second main event of the season before a crowd of 4,760. Sigman's other 
main-event win was also wire to wire. 
</P>
<P>
"Having the pole is like winning a lottery ticket," Sigman said. "There's no 
way you're gonna throw it away." 
</P>
<P>
Just to make sure, Sigman took four brand new tires off a friend's car and put 
them on his. 
</P>
<P>
But Sigman still had to contend with Will Harper of Tarzana, who rode on 
Sigman's bumper all night, eventually settling for second place. But Harper's 
finish was a boon to the points leader. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, who has experienced some hard luck the past month, started third on the 
grid Saturday and went quickly to work, passing Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley 
and then holding the position to strengthen his points lead.. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Hobby Stock driver J.R. Ybarra of Monrovia, few fans took 
note of his impressive runaway win in the oval main event. Ybarra started on 
the pole and led for all 25 laps, often leading by almost half a lap. 
</P>
<P>
But most eyes were locked on Gerald Gledhill of Reseda and A.R. Allert of 
Canyon Country, as the two waged a magnificent battle for second place. 
</P>
<P>
From Lap 15 on, Gledhill and Allert traded second and third spots five times 
with some daring and eye-opening driving. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the intrigue was the fact that Gledhill was driving with no brakes 
for the last five laps, accounting for the repeated wide turns that allowed 
Allert to sneak back into second place. 
</P>
<P>
Gledhill, however, whipped past Allert at the finish line in what amounted to a 
photo finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked hard for that one," Gledhill said. "I wasn't about to lose the 
position, though. That's about as close as I've come and the most work I've 
ever done." 
</P>
<P>
The 20-lap Outlaw Mini Stock main-event drew fewer gasps, but Larry Mansfield 
of Ontario didn't mind. He started third and took the lead on Lap 7. Mansfield 
never trailed in the main-event win. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Smith of Reseda won the 15-lap Jalopy main event. 
</P>
<P>
In fast heat races, Harper sped around Rodney Peacher of Sepulveda on the back 
straightaway of Lap 1 and raced uncontested to a six-lap win. 
</P>
<P>
The Hobby Stock figure-eight dash had another exciting finish, with Oliver 
Aguilar of Sun Valley taking the win after apparent winner Mike McAtee of North 
Hollywood was bumped back by the judges. Pat Garrett of Burbank and Jim 
Gunnarson of Reseda, leaders through most of the six-lap race, spun out 
together in the intersection of Lap 4. 
</P>
<P>
Other fast-heat winners included Oscar Sevilla of Mission Hills (Jalopy), 
Lancaster's Ron Cerven (Hobby Stock oval) and Larry Mansfield of Ontario 
(Outlaw Minis).

KANSAS CITY GIVING ACE SABERHAGEN LOTS OF ELBOW ROOM AFTER SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Credit Bret Saberhagen with wanting to recover quickly enough from arthroscopic 
elbow surgery to pitch again this season. 
</P>
<P>
Credit the Kansas City Royals with considering shelving Saberhagen until next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
The competitive fire of the pitcher is rightfully being tempered by the 
cautiousness of the club. 
</P>
<P>
"(Saberhagen is) too valuable to fool around with," said Frank Funk, the 
Royals' pitching coach. "There is no sense running guys like that out there to 
pitch until they are ready. This is a million-dollar arm you're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen, a two-time Cy Young Award winner from Cleveland High, had two rice 
grain-sized bone fragments removed Monday from his pitching elbow. Team 
officials described the surgery as successful and Saberhagen predicted he could 
be throwing again in three to five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals, however, are mired in last place in the American League West, and, 
as of Saturday, trailed the first-place Oakland Athletics by 16 games. Nothing 
Saberhagen, 26, can do in a few September starts can change that. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, pitcher Mark Gubicza and outfielders Bo Jackson and Danny 
Tartabull are out with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't rush any of the players on the disabled list back into the lineup 
until there is no question about their health," Royals Manager John Wathan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Perseverance personified: His professional career began in frigid Medicine Hat, 
Canada, and hung by a thread in sweltering Laredo, Mexico. But in his ninth 
minor league season, Dave Walsh, a left-hander from El Camino Real High, is 
finally on the verge of a call to the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's numbers suggest the promotion is due: He leads the Albuquerque Dukes 
with 12 saves, a 2.65 earned-run average and has a 5-0 record. Also, the Dukes 
are the triple-A affiliate of the Dodgers, a team in need of left-handed relief 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh has risen from the scrap heap of rag arms to be reborn as a prospect at 
age 29. "It would be awesome to be up there before I turn 30," he said of 
pitching for the Dodgers. "But I take it one day at a time." 
</P>
<P>
That's the only way he has survived an odyssey that included two knee 
operations, tendinitis in his pitching shoulder, banishment to the Mexican 
League and what Walsh describes as divine guidance. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, signed in 1982 out of the UC Santa Barbara by the Toronto Blue Jays, 
wore out his welcome after bouncing around the Blue Jays bushes for six years. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up in the middle of the night this one Saturday and had a strong 
feeling I was going to get released," he said. "I laid in bed and prayed over 
whether I should quit or keep trying. The next day, sure enough, they called me 
into the office and said they were sending me to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to laugh. They looked at me like I was crazy. I said, 'Hey, I'll 
experience another culture.' " 
</P>
<P>
Walsh flourished with Laredo, leading the league with a 14-1 record and a 1.73 
ERA. His success caught the attention of the Dodgers, who thrust him into 
Albuquerque's starting rotation last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers soon had second thoughts: Walsh was 1-2 with a 5.00 ERA after six 
starts. Down to his last chance, Walsh was sent to double-A San Antonio and 
converted to relief. Although he was 2-6, his ERA was 3.72 and he notched two 
saves. And he met a coach who believed in him -- former Dodger pitcher Claude 
Osteen. 
</P>
<P>
"Osteen taught me about getting power out of my legs," Walsh said. "I never 
threw 90 miles an hour my whole life and now I do sometimes. It's amazing and I 
owe it to Claude." 
</P>
<P>
The new-found velocity is apparent; Walsh has struck out 60 and allowed only 45 
hits in 54 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Can he do the same against National League hitters? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I am ready for the first time in my career, as far as control, my 
pitches and my health," Walsh said. "I think the Dodgers are getting to know 
who I am and what I am made of." 
</P>
<P>
Playing Tags: Be wary, New York-Penn League pitchers and umpires. Gino 
Tagliaferri is slowly regaining that swinging, swaggering feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri set City Section records last season at Kennedy High for home runs 
in a season and career. He also never hesitated to tell an umpire his opinion 
of a call and once drilled a home run that landed on an arbiter's auto. 
</P>
<P>
After signing with the Detroit Tigers for a $55,000 bonus last July, however, 
Tagliaferri struggled to a .173 batting average for Niagara Falls of the 
Class-A New York-Penn League. He struck out 54 times in 110 at-bats, hit only 
three home runs and found that professional umpires don't take kindly to advice 
from raw rookies. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri, 19, began this season with Fayetteville of the Class-A South 
Atlantic League and hit .212 with four home runs in 58 games. Although he led 
the team with 73 strikeouts, he hit a dramatic three-run home run against 
Asheville on June 14 to help Fayetteville clinch the first-half Northern 
Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, he was shipped back to Niagara Falls in what could be 
considered a slight demotion. "As young as Gino is, the Tigers don't want him 
down on himself," said Dan McD, a Fayetteville official. "They want him 
somewhere he can prosper." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri's spirits plummeted, however, when he was told he was leaving 
Fayetteville. 
</P>
<P>
"They rushed me a little by sending me to Fayetteville in the first place, but 
getting sent to Niagara was very disappointing and hard to cope with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His depression carried onto the field; he had only one hit in his first 12 
games with Niagara Falls. Lately, however, the move has paid off the way the 
Tigers envisioned: Tagliaferri has 22 hits in his past 25 games, including 
three homers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to pop," said Tagliaferri, who added that he has ceased popping off 
to umpires. "I'm getting my confidence level back to where it was in high 
school." 
</P>
<P>
His three-run home run with two out in the eighth lifted Niagara Falls to a 9-6 
victory over Utica last week. After primarily playing left field at 
Fayetteville, Tagliaferri (5-11, 190) has moved back to third base, the 
position he played last season. He was a shortstop in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoyed outfield when I was there," he said. "I've always loved 
shortstop, but the first thing they did when I was signed was make me a third 
baseman. Now I can see why. They want me to be a power hitter and the 
shortstops here are little quick guys."

COLBERT GOES DEEP FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For one swing of the bat, it was like the glory days of old for Nate Colbert. 
</P>
<P>
Colbert became the Padres' first hero when he hit 38 home runs in 1970 and 
again in 1972, and he unleashed a sample of his old power in the Equitable 
Old-Timers home run derby Saturday night at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
After hitting a 390-foot drive that would have left the park if it hadn't gone 
to dead center field, Colbert sent one of Bill (Spaceman) Lee's pitches over 
the left-field wall in the sixth inning of the National League's 6-1 victory 
over the American. 
</P>
<P>
Colbert's home run struck the scaffolding used by an unsuspecting photographer 
behind the wall. The photographer was looking elsewhere at the time, and the 
ball missed him by no more than two feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know if it would go out," Colbert said afterward. "It wasn't like 
when I was 22. At 22, I knew right away, but at 44 I wasn't sure. At this 
point, I have warning-track power." 
</P>
<P>
Colbert is the Padres' all-time home-run leader, having hit 163 as their first 
baseman from 1969 to 1974. He is now a coach for their Riveride farm club and 
serves in their community relations department in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had gotten a special kick out of reliving a bit of his dynamic past 
before the home folks, Colbert said, "Not really. I do it simply because of the 
purpose of the game. It's for old-time players who need help." 
</P>
<P>
A donation of $10,000 from each of the 26 games in of the Equitable series goes 
to the Baseball Assistance Team (BAT) foundation, created to aid players of 
pre-pension days. 
</P>
<P>
Another man in a Padre uniform hit a home run immediately after Colbert's, and 
for him it was a thrill. Denny Summers, the Padres' bullpen coach, who never 
played in the major leagues, hit a line drive over the right-field wall, also 
off Lee. Earlier, he hit a ball to the same area that fell about 10 feet short. 
</P>
<P>
"This was great," Summers said. "It was my first Old-Timers game ever, and I 
loved it. "Being a left-handed hitter, I wasn't too happy when they ran a 
left-hander (Lee) out there. I thought to myself, 'They really want to get me 
out.' The first one I hit, there had to be a little more strength on it, but I 
knew the second one had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
The champion home-run hitter of the night was Rico Carty, 50, who hit two off 
Fergie Jenkins in the same time at bat. He also just missed a homer on a drive 
that went even farther than the two others but was barely foul. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a hitter, always a hitter," said Carty, who hit 204 home runs and had a 
.299 career average. 
</P>
<P>
The other National League home runs were hit by Hall of Famer Lou Brock and 
Ellis Valentine who, at 36, was the youngest Old-Timer. Brock's struck the 
right-field foul pole about 30 feet up, and Valentine's was the most prodigious 
poke of all, landing in the 10th row of the left-field-seats. 
</P>
<P>
And for the American League? With such musclemen as Frank Howard, Willie 
Horton, George Scott and Jim Gentile on the team, it fell to the light-hitting 
Bucky Dent to hit the only home run. 
</P>
<P>
Dent finished with a career total of just 40 home runs, the most memorable of 
which propelled the New York Yankees to a victory over the Boston Red Sox in a 
one-game playoff for the American League pennant in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"With all those boomers around me, I was really getting teased," Dent said. 
"After I hit one out (off Dennis Leonard), I heard the guys saying, 'Somebody's 
got to hit one. We can't let this little guy get the only one.' It was a great 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
The contest was played over seven innings as a preliminary to the 
Padres-Houston Astros game. The format was a first for the Old-Timers series, 
and it received mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Lee May said, "I liked it. People get to see more players hit. There's one 
thing about hitting. No matter how old you get, you can still hit the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Hall of Famer Billy Williams cast a negative vote, saying, "I don't think the 
fans got much out of this. There are guys who can still make plays in the 
outfield, and Lou Brock can still run the bases. I think the people would 
rather see that than just a bunch of guys hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Old Timer Notes 
</P>
<P>
Frank Howard managed the Padres only in their disastrous, strike-torn season of 
1981, yet he has positive memories of his only chance to lead a club. "It was 
one of the greatest experiences of my life," Howard said. "We had some great 
young talent, like Ozzie Smith for example, and the guy who followed me (Dick 
Williams) added good leadership to that talent." . . . Hall of Famer Ernie 
Banks brought along an aluminum bat, which he and Bill Lee used once each. "I'm 
testing it for Sadahara Oh (the all-time Japanese home-run champion). He's 
marketing it over there," Banks said.

MUTUAL FUNDS: DON'T ENVY THE RICH THEIR MONEY MANAGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national 
consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rich can afford bigger homes, fancier cars, snootier schools for their 
kids. They can also get the services of private money managers. But will they 
get better performance than middle-class folks who invest in mutual funds? Not 
necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of performance, mutual funds are surprisingly competitive with private 
money managers, and they offer a wider range of investment choices. Most funds 
can be purchased by anyone with as little as $250 to $3,000 to invest. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, private money managers -- those who cater to wealthy individuals 
and institutions -- are generally beyond the reach of people with less than 
$250,000 to invest. A few managers accept portfolios as small as $25,000 or 
$50,000, while others insist on assets of $1 million to $5 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
Fees vary, too. On smaller privately managed accounts, investors can expect to 
pay 1% or more each year on the assets in the portfolio, plus transaction costs 
for buying and selling securities. For bigger portfolios, there's usually a 
proportionately smaller fee. 
</P>
<P>
Private money managers come in all shapes and sizes. Some are one-person 
outfits, while others work for brokerages, bank trust departments and even 
mutual fund companies. Mutual funds evolved largely as a means of attracting 
smaller investors who couldn't qualify for individual portfolio supervision. 
More than a few fund managers also supervise personal accounts on the side, and 
vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
As a whole, money managers appear to have delivered better results than mutual 
funds, but not by much. CDA Investment Technologies of Rockville, Md., 
monitored the performance of 76 money management companies catering to wealthy 
equity investors during the 10 years ended June 30. CDA found that the average 
manager posted a 17% annual compounded gain for the period -- about in line 
with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. 
</P>
<P>
The average equity mutual fund rose at a 15.3% annual clip over the same 
period, according to Lipper Analytical Services. But it's hard to make exact 
comparisons, in part because all mutual fund results are net of management fees 
and other expenses. That's not the case for every money manager included in the 
CDA survey. 
</P>
<P>
Also, all fund performance numbers are audited and easily verifiable. The same 
can't be said for all money manager results. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, nearly one in three domestic and international equity funds with 
10-year records beat the CDA average for money managers. That suggests that if 
you invest in superior mutual funds, you can expect returns at least as good as 
those available through private managers. 
</P>
<P>
If most private money managers can't beat the market or the average mutual fund 
by more than 1.7 percentage points a year, why do many rich investors flock to 
them? Personalized service is the main answer. "There will be somebody to guide 
you and to tell you where to put your money to work," says Olin Barrett, a 
managing director who supervises large personal accounts in Los Angeles for 
Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, the Boston-based mutual fund company. 
</P>
<P>
Investors receive a portfolio of stocks and bonds that's tailor-made to reflect 
their income needs, risk tolerance and the like. 
</P>
<P>
But this still doesn't explain why private money managers require such large 
accounts. On the one hand, it's a matter of diversification and liquidity. To 
reduce the impact of a particular company going down the drain, most managers 
will develop a portfolio with at least a couple of dozen stocks. 
</P>
<P>
And to get the best prices, they will trade in blocks of 100 shares each, known 
as round lots. "You might need to buy 500 or 1,000 shares to get a decent break 
on the commission," says Fred Astman, chairman and portfolio manager of First 
Wilshire Securities Management in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, money managers charge a minimum annual fee, as well as transaction 
costs. These expenses could quickly erode a portfolio of insufficient size. 
</P>
<P>
Scudder, for example, charges a minimum of $7,500 a year on private 
stock-oriented accounts. "There's no specific limit on portfolio size, but the 
fee schedule is such that somebody should have $750,000 or more," Barrett says. 
That would limit the annual fees to 1% or so -- a widely followed benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
At First Wilshire Securities Management, which achieved a stellar 21.8% average 
annual compounded return during the 1980s on accounts monitored by CDA, the 
minimum yearly fee runs $1,000. Astman prefers clients with at least $100,000 
to invest. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, some money managers place a portion of their clients' assets in 
mutual funds. This might seem strange until you consider that most managers 
don't have expertise in certain exotic investment areas, such as international 
stocks and bonds. The funds provide an easy way to get exposure in these 
sectors. 
</P>
<P>
At Scudder, for example, a typical $750,000 individual portfolio might be 
spread around 20 to 25 stocks as well as some international funds and municipal 
bond funds. Munis are notoriously illiquid and thus can be bought and sold more 
easily through a fund, Barrett says. 
</P>
<P>
Some wealthy folks shun the private-management route altogether in favor of 
mutual funds. "We have dozens of accounts where people have put $1 million or 
more into one or more funds," says Tim Pitts, executive vice president at 
Oppenheimer Funds in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that levy front-end sales charges on their funds typically reduce or 
eliminate the fees on big purchases. For example, Oppenheimer, which imposes 
loads ranging from 4.5% to 8.5% on small investments, reduces the charge to 
0.25% on purchases of $4 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
Pitts expects to see more people making big-dollar investments in mutual funds. 
A whole generation of baby boomers, he explains, has grown up buying funds 
because they couldn't afford much else. As individuals in this group grow 
wealthier -- thanks to inheritances, pension-plan distributions and their own 
labor -- many will stick with the products they know best. 
</P>
<P>
If you're fortunate enough to join the ranks of the wealthy, you will have the 
opportunity to hire a private money manager. Just don't assume that this 
investment approach will prove more profitable than a tried-and-true mutual 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
After all, private money managers face most of the same investment challenges 
that fund managers do. At some companies, the same person wears both hats. In 
fact, it's not misleading to think of an individually run portfolio as just 
another type of mutual fund -- one with your name attached. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MUTUAL FUNDS VS. PRIVATE ACCOUNTS 
</P>
<P>
Can you get better results from a private money manager than from mutual funds? 
Not always. 
</P>
<P>
Most mutual fund companies have their own private management divisions, 
designed to cater to high net worth individuals. Yet sometimes the funds do 
better than private accounts run by managers employed by the same firm. 
</P>
<P>
The following chart lists the performance of all general equity funds with 
10-year track records at four leading mutual fund companies; it also includes 
returns for privately managed accounts at the same firms.

'BROADWAY SAM' COHN STILL HOLDS COURT IN NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Above the door hangs a black top hat with glittery letters that read "Broadway 
Sam." 
</P>
<P>
On the walls are the obligatory posters touting clients -- Meryl Streep, 
Sigourney Weaver, Woody Allen, Diane Wiest, Mike Nichols, Robert Benton, Fred 
Schepisi, Susan Seidelman. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the middle of it all, sits Sam Cohn: co-founder of ICM and, by some 
accounts, the greatest talent agent in the world. "He is what we should all 
aspire to be," insisted one ex-protege, who worked closely with Cohn before 
leaving ICM to join a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Other colleagues argue that Cohn, while dominating New York's talent business 
for the past 16 years, also hurt ICM by isolating his domain from the company's 
large West Coast film operation. 
</P>
<P>
"Things change," Cohn responded to that criticism. During an hourlong interview 
at ICM's West 57th Street office, the 60-year-old agent said he's not only 
talking more often with his California counterparts but also eventually expects 
to join them weekly in coast-to-coast video hook-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding other matters, Cohn had some pointed thoughts to share. 
</P>
<P>
On Michael Ovitz and CAA: "Michael and I have butted heads, oh, sure. . . . 
(But CAA's presence) in New York is minuscule." (According to others, CAA 
grabbed Cher, Robin Williams and Whoopi Goldberg from Cohn's client list but 
didn't seriously diminish his empire.) 
</P>
<P>
On studio chiefs: "I can tell you exactly what the qualities that make a great 
movie executive are. And 95% of the guys running things don't have them." 
</P>
<P>
On California: "I haven't been to Los Angeles for a meeting (with Hollywood 
executives) in 10 years. I don't think I've ever been out to meet with 
(Universal's) Tom Pollock or the newer crop. They all come here. . . . More 
talent wants to live in New York now. If they can pull it off, they want to be 
closer to the serious side of things." 
</P>
<P>
On the dismantling of Josephson International: "The idea is to spread the 
equity around (among agents). . . . We didn't, as a talent agency, want to end 
up paying for purchases we didn't want." MICHAEL CIEPLY

BUYOUT POSED PROBLEMS AT JOSEPHSON INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing losses from his Herzfeld &amp; Stern brokerage unit -- and discontent 
among ICM agents, who felt that their profits were paying for the parent's 
missteps -- Marvin Josephson began selling non-agency businesses in 1985. Three 
years later, he and top managers tried to buy out Josephson International for a 
package of cash and debt that they valued at $13.50 a share, only to have 
outside directors reject the bid after several shareholders filed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the group paid $14.52 cash per share in a complex deal that split 
off the remaining office products unit and gave Josephson 87% voting control of 
ICM, while 60% of its equity was marked for distribution to agents. 
</P>
<P>
According to Josephson, about 30 of ICM's 124 agents participate in company 
ownership. But the largest portion of stock was sold, at half the price 
Josephson paid for it, to ICM Chairman Jeffrey Berg, President James Wiatt and 
Co-Chairman Cohn. (While holding a minority of votes, the three can veto new 
acquisitions by Josephson. Josephson said he plans eventually to cash out much 
of his own stake.) 
</P>
<P>
That arrangement immediately caused problems when Lynn Nesbit, the highly 
respected head of ICM's New York book operation, left to join an independent 
agency closely allied with Creative Artists Agency because she had been 
excluded from the core buyout group. "Lynne felt that a negotiation should have 
been not just myself, Jeff, Sam and Jim," Josephson explained. Nesbit declined 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Berg, ICM expects to retire its $60 million in acquisition debt 
well before a 1996 deadline. Since going private, however, agency officers have 
declined to discuss finances, other than to say business has grown 
substantially since 1988, when Josephson International last filed reports with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Even the number of clients is apparently a touchy subject. Josephson said the 
agency has 3,000 clients, and an annual report three years ago put the client 
list at 2,600. But Berg said a realistic count is closer to 2,000, partly 
because many musical groups include several members. By comparison, CAA claims 
about 600, though some alumni of that agency have put the count closer to 1,400 
-- a number that CAA strongly disputes. MICHAEL CIEPLY

I will greatly mourn the passing of television game show host Bill Cullen. I 
was a veteran game show player with two game shows under my belt when I had the 
privilege of being chosen as a contestant on Cullen's short-lived 1983 game 
show "Child's Play." 
</P>
<P>
I had won two rounds and was playing the bonus round for $5,000 when in the 
middle of guessing word clues under a 30-second time clock, the producer yelled 
"Cut!" 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, one of the technicians backstage misheard me and gave me credit for 
a wrong answer. I was told I had a choice of either continuing with the 13 
seconds I had left on the clock or starting a new bonus round. 
</P>
<P>
I was confused and didn't know what to do. Bill looked at the new set of word 
clues and said, "Marla, start a new game. These clues look easy. I am sure 
you'll guess all of them." 
</P>
<P>
With a new-found confidence, I asked the producer for a new game, closed my 
eyes and refocused my concentration. Bill's encouragement helped me to win the 
$5,000. He didn't have to go out of his way for me or any other contestant. 
After doing 25,000 TV and radio shows, he didn't have to do anything but show 
up and get paid. But Bill cared about people and their dreams. For that reason, 
I will never forget him or his kindness.

Operation Petticoat (Channel 9 Sunday at 1 p.m.): Blake Edwards' biggest 
pre-"Panther" hit was this 1959 comedy about commander Cary Grant, con man Tony 
Curtis and a subful of unabashed nurses. A bit like a boudoir "Mr. Roberts," it 
has daffy slapstick, sexy wit. (2:00) 
</P>
<P>
A Nous la Liberte &amp; Man About Town (TNT Sunday at 11:10 p.m. &amp; 1:10 
a.m.): Two Rene Clair comedies from before and after his Hollywood interlude. 
</P>
<P>
"A Nous," often considered his masterpiece, inspired Chaplin's "Modern Times." 
"Man" is a joyous Maurice Chevalier vehicle. (3:50) 
</P>
<P>
A Night With Luis Bunuel (Bravo Tuesday at 7 p.m., 9 p.m., 11 p.m. &amp; 1 
a.m.): Four films in a row from the cinema's greatest surrealist, fiercest 
moralist, thorniest free spirit. In order: the scathing gem, "Discreet Charm of 
the Bourgeosie" (1972), Bunuel's favorite, "The Milky Way" (1969), "The Phantom 
of Liberty" (1974) and Jeanne Moreau in "Diary of a Chambermaid" (1964; adapted 
from Mirabeau, remade from Renoir). 
</P>
<P>
Clash by Night (TNT Saturday at 5 p.m.): Fritz Lang's brooding film of the 
Clifford Odets play: an oceanside drama of lust and betrayal with Barbara 
Stanwyck and Robert Ryan (a terrific villain). In a minor role: Marilyn Monroe.

For once, Mason and Hamilton Burger are on the same side on Perry Mason

The harmless ending of The Dick Van Dyke Show was controversial back in 1963, 
when it first aired. In "That's My Boy??" (Tuesday at 1 p.m. on KDOC) Rob is 
convinced that the baby he and Laura have brought home from the hospital isn't 
theirs. The kicker that explains why Rob needn't have worried almost didn't 
make it on the air.

Later in the week, a pre-Angel Ladd is in safer hands with Richie Cunningham, 
who wins a date with her on Happy Days (Saturday at noon on KTLA). Arnold

RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: BURT'S DODGE CITY DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before "B.L. Stryker," before "Smokey and the Bandit," before 
"Deliverance"-even before "Dan August"-Burt Reynolds was a humble blacksmith on 
Gunsmoke. 
</P>
<P>
You can't be expected to remember him; during "Gunsmoke's" 20-year run (from 
1955 to 1975), a lot of people passed through Dodge City. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, only Matt Dillon (James Arness) and Doc Adams (Milburn Stone) lasted 
the whole 20 years. Kitty (Amanda Blake) was there 19, and Chester (Dennis 
Weaver) and Festus (Ken Curtis) considerably less. Reynolds stayed in town just 
three years-as -Quint Asper, whose mother was white and father was Comanche. 
</P>
<P>
In "Quint Asper Comes Home" (Sunday at 1 p.m. on Family), the 1962 episode that 
introduced him, Quint decides to leave white society and avenge his father, who 
was killed by Indian haters. Marshal Dillon manages to talk him out of the 
vendetta, and Quint settles in as the town's new smithy. 
</P>
<P>
"Gunsmoke" was not Reynolds' first series. He spent several months on 
"Riverboat," which starred Darren McGavin.

UNREQUITED EFFORT BRINGS DEFEAT FOR MCCASKILL, 2-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If he could blame Saturday's 2-1 loss to the Mariners on the bone spurs that 
caused him to miss two starts earlier this season, or if he could cite a 
damaged ligament or even an old hockey injury, Kirk McCaskill would not have 
felt so achingly empty. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd probably feel better if I was hurt," the Angel right-hander said. 
</P>
<P>
Strange as that sounds, there's logic to it. McCaskill (7-7) no-hit the 
Mariners for 5 1/3 innings at the Kingdome and pitched with better stuff and 
better stamina than he has in months. He has pitched exceptionally well his 
last three outings, but in his last two has only a no-decision and a galling 
loss to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm completely unsatisfied," said McCaskill, who yielded three hits and 
pitched into the eighth inning, his longest stint since he went 8 1/3 against 
the Baltimore Orioles on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
"You (reporters) will never know what it's like out there. It can be the 
greatest feeling in the world -- and the worst. The nuances of the game are 
hard to deal with. You can perform well and still lose." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill's only flaws were five walks, and the recipient of one of those -- 
Greg Briley -- scored the tying run in the fifth inning on a double by Ken 
Griffey Jr. Griffey tagged and advanced to third on Alvin Davis' fly ball to 
center and scored the decisive run on Jeffrey Leonard's single to right. 
</P>
<P>
"The runs they scored, it would be easy to look in hindsight," McCaskill said, 
"but I made the pitches I wanted to make in those situations. The thing I was 
most disturbed about is I walked so many people. I've been doing it all year 
and I don't know why. It cost me big tonight." 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't have if the offense had taken advantage of at least two 
opportunities. In losing for the sixth time in seven games, the Angels left 11 
runners on base, including three in the sixth inning. They left two on in the 
fourth after Brian Downing's sacrifice fly -- the first out of the inning -- 
scored Devon White with their lone run. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel for Kirk, and I feel for any pitcher when we score only one run," Lee 
Stevens said. "Kirk kept us in the game. You've got to give him a lot of 
credit." 
</P>
<P>
Seeing another courageous effort by McCaskill go to waste left Manager Doug 
Rader as exasperated as he has been this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a guy out there pitching with a broken arm," he said. "The guy's 
going to need an operation after the year's out. The guy's busting his tail. 
Unbelievable. . . . We had two chances to break the game open and we score one 
run in two big-inning opportunities. That's absolutely terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Asking what else he could conjure up that might galvanize the offense didn't 
improve his mood. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you suggest? What hasn't been tried?" said Rader, who has used 99 
different lineups in 101 games. "I think it's pretty obvious we've tried 
everything so far. We've done it all. We've tried everything we could possibly 
try to create a different offensive atmosphere, and we cannot seem to come up 
with anything consistently effective." 
</P>
<P>
Holman's sinker was effective for 6 2/3 innings, and he helped his own cause in 
the sixth with a spectacular play. Stevens had singled with one out and moved 
to third base on Lance Parrish's double. The Mariners walked Downing 
intentionally to match Holman against the right-handed hitting Dante Bichette. 
The strategy proved successful, if somewhat painful for Holman, when Bichette 
hit a shot that ricocheted off Holman's glove and knocked him off the mound as 
he completed his follow through. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being unable to stand, Holman managed to crawl to the ball and throw it 
home to get force out Stevens. "It was a lot of luck and a lot of 
determination," Holman said after the Mariners moved five games above .500, the 
latest point in the season they have had so good a record. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, 1-5 with four games left on this road trip, are feeling frustrated 
as never before. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making everybody look like superstars," Bichette said. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching well is some consolation to McCaskill, but not enough. 
</P>
<P>
"This is as well as I've thrown in a long time as far as having four pitches 
and hitting spots and making pitches when I need to," said McCaskill, who will 
undergo elbow surgery after the season to remove his troublesome bone spurs. "I 
hope it can continue and I can help us win. I'm getting tired of this losing 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Kent Anderson, recalled from triple-A Edmonton after Friday's game 
when third baseman Jack Howell was optioned, arrived at the Kingdome shortly 
after 4 p.m. because of travel delays. He wasn't in the starting lineup but was 
delighted to be back in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping to be called up, but you're always surprised when it happens," 
said Anderson, who was sent to Edmonton on June 30. "I was looking forward to 
it and hoping it would be as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson hit .271 with seven RBIs in 14 games with the Trappers. He split time 
between second base and third base. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' starting infield Saturday had produced 37 RBIs entering the game: 
second baseman Donnie Hill had 20, third baseman Rick Schu had 10, first 
baseman Lee Stevens had six and shortstop Dick Schofield had one. Schofield 
played Saturday for the first time since last Sunday, when he injured his right 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, who was hitting .208 with 19 RBIs, said he wasn't shocked at being 
optioned. "Once Devon (White) was sent down, I figured having the same numbers 
he had and having struggled at the plate the first part of the season, it could 
happen to me, too," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
Angel broadcaster Joe Torre, still awaiting word from the St. Louis Cardinals 
on their managing job, said a report from New York that he had already signed a 
three-year contract was false. 
</P>
<P>
Bob McClure pitched two simulated innings Friday and will throw again Monday in 
Minnesota. . . . After committing their 89th error Friday, the Angels are seven 
short of their total for 1989. . . . After striking out seven times Friday, the 
Angels totaled 606 strikeouts. Among AL teams, only the Texas Rangers -- at 646 
before Saturday's game -- have struck out more.

DODGERS PROVIDE THE EXTRA EFFORT, 8-7, NOT EXTRA INNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
July hadn't been much of a month for Juan Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
He had struggled at the plate, hitting only .238. He spent a few hours in a 
Pittsburgh jail after being involved in a bar fight. 
</P>
<P>
And that was after spending some time on the bench last month when he briefly 
lost his starting job. 
</P>
<P>
But with one swing Saturday night, Samuel made up for a lot of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
His bases-loaded single in the ninth inning completed a comeback as the Dodgers 
rallied for four runs in that final inning to beat the Atlanta Braves, 8-7, 
before 38,022 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who needed 12 innings to beat the Braves Friday night, are nine 
games behind the division-leading Cincinnati Reds, the closest the Dodgers have 
been since June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Would a division title still require an impossible comeback? 
</P>
<P>
No more so than the one the Dodgers fashioned Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Behind by three runs, down to their last out with only one base runner, the 
Dodgers got their first run of the rally on a single to right by Kirk Gibson 
against reliever Tony Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
A single by Kal Daniels brought Mark Grant on in relief. He walked Eddie 
Murray, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
A soft liner to center by Hubie Brooks over the head of shortstop Jeff Blauser 
produced two runs, tying the score. 
</P>
<P>
"I was strong enough to fist it over the infield," Brooks said. "I know I just 
needed a base hit, so I didn't want to overswing. I think it was a high 
changeup." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after an intentional walk to Mike Scioscia, Samuel, down to his last 
strike, delivered another soft liner to center. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't pretty, but it got the job done," Samuel said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hard slider. He was trying to protect the plate on 0 and 2. It was a 
good pitch and I was lucky enough to get the bat on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hartley (2-1) got the victory; Grant (1-2) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you, there is going to still be a race," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can get it down to seven, we've still got August and September to go." 
</P>
<P>
The Braves got to starter Fernando Valenzuela early. They got two hits and two 
walks in the first inning, with a run scoring on Dale Murphy's single. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers answered in kind in the first, with two hits and two walks, their 
run scoring on a sacrifice fly by Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Something has seemed to happen to Valenzuela in the middle innings of games 
this season and Saturday was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
He had retired eight in a row after Murphy's run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
But Murphy reignited the offense when he slammed a double to left field in the 
fourth. Blauser followed with a run-scoring single to left to push Atlanta back 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Cabrera kept the rally alive with a single. With two out, Atlanta 
starter John Smoltz doubled into right field. The pitcher was thrown out trying 
to stretch it to a triple, but both runners scored. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela's ERA this year in the first three innings of games is 2.40. In the 
final three innings, it is 1.06. But in the middle three, even before Saturday, 
it was 5.98. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers kept Valenzuela in the game with two sixth-inning homers. Murray 
hit his 16th of the season into the right-field bullpen with Daniels on base. 
Scioscia added his ninth into the right-field pavilion to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
But not for long. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela got right back into trouble in the seventh, giving up an infield 
single to Smoltz and a double to Lonnie Smith with one out. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lemke, playing for injured Jeff Treadway, followed with a sinking liner to 
left. Daniels made a desperate dive for it. 
</P>
<P>
It was barely beyond his grasp, however, falling for a two-run double that 
proved the last gasp for Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Jim Gott gave up an RBI single to Ron Gant to close out the scoring 
for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers were only getting started. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of game than can ruin a team," Smoltz said. "This is the kind 
of thing that really hurts your confidence. I'm still waiting to wake up." 
</P>
<P>
It took the Dodgers awhile Saturday, but they woke up in the nick of time. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
While rumors continue to circulate that Kirk Gibson will be traded to either 
the Oakland Athletics or Detroit Tigers before Tuesday's trading deadline, 
Dodger Vice President Fred Claire insists nothing has been decided. "Kirk is 
playing as hard as he can," Claire said, "and given everything he has. Things 
change. Kirk recognizes he has a contract. He hasn't ruled anything in or out 
and we haven't ruled anything in or out. But it is not a done deal." . . . 
Maury Wills, the Dodgers' all-time leading base stealer, has been hired as a 
minor league instructor, specializing in stealing and bunting. . . . Atlanta 
second baseman Jeff Treadway, suffering from a sore right hand, was a late 
scratch from the starting lineup. . . . The four-game series will end today 
with a 1 p.m. game pitting the Dodgers' Ramon Martinez (12-4) against Atlanta's 
Charlie Leibrandt (4-3).

ROSE BOOK WAS A STORY IN ITSELF; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: EVEN BEFORE HE BEGAN WRITING THE BIOGRAPHY, THE AUTHOR HAD 
FRUSTRATIONS. IN THE END, HE WONDERS IF IT'S FAIR TO CONDEMN THE CINCINNATI 
STAR.

<P>
By ROGER KAHN, Roger Kahn is the author of Pete Rose's biography, published 
last year amid charges that Rose gambled on sports, including baseball. Kahn 
gives his perspective on working with Rose and the events involving Rose's ban 
from baseball. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose, my friend, the felon, and I started working together four years ago 
after a $250,000 misunderstanding. A flash and glitz publishing company called 
Warner Books decided that an accurately spelled work prepared by Pete Rose and 
myself would be worth a million dollars. We did not argue. Exciting a bodyguard 
of agents, Laurence Kirshbaum, a thin-chested, nasal fellow who is president of 
Warner Books, said he would pay us each $50,000 a year for 10 years. Twenty 
payments. Fifty big ones. A cool million. 
</P>
<P>
But money, as one is reminded at least monthly, has the quality economists call 
time utility. With two children in college, I was concerned with immediate 
income. Reuven Katz, Rose's attorney, said that Pete had plenty of cash, but 
what did we know about Warner Books and Laurence Kirshbaum? "I'm reluctant to 
put my client into a 10-year relationship with an unknown," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
So Warner would have to pay us over three years, not 10. Time utility persisted 
and Kirshbaum's offer shrank. Over three years we could split $750,000. Still, 
agents cheered. 
</P>
<P>
Warner had offered us a million, sort of, and Warner wanted to tell the press 
that it was publishing the FIRST MILLION-DOLLAR SPORTS BOOK ABSOLUTELY EVER 
SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME. 
</P>
<P>
Kirshbaum and agents wrote clauses in which Rose and I agreed possibly to put 
some of the advance into zero coupon bonds. At a later date our haul actually 
might reach a million, if the companies issuing the bonds did not go bankrupt 
and the Ohio River didn't rise. 
</P>
<P>
Warner lured the press into an executive suite a few days later where Kirshbaum 
announced to nibbling, guzzling reporters that he had signed a million-dollar 
book. Warner then sent us a small fraction of the $750,000, which is all we 
ever saw. The book for Warner never worked. Books that begin with a naked hype 
seldom do. 
</P>
<P>
This was a Rose in the full bloom and bluster of great triumph. A few months 
earlier, Sept. 11, 1985, he had broken Ty Cobb's record for major league hits. 
As a sophomore manager he brought the Cincinnati Reds home second that season, 
their best finish in years. Attendance jumped 600,000. Pete Rose of Cincinnati 
was not only the man who broke Cobb's record; he was the man who saved the 
major league franchise for the river town where professional baseball began. 
</P>
<P>
He had agents and lawyers and accountants and a company. Pete Rose Enterprises, 
Inc., marketed lotions and chocolates and chili, and breakfast food and most of 
all marketed Pete Rose. He was one aggressive corporate entity. 
</P>
<P>
If you wanted Rose to speak, you had to pay the company $15,000, and add in 
transportation by private jet. "I like," he said, "money coming in, a young 
wife, a fast life. I got all three." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, the publisher was gone and the misled press had vanished. Pete 
Rose, corporate entity, was now Pete Rose, feller, dressed too casually for the 
Waldorf Astoria Restaurant where we sat. Sports shirt. No jacket. No tie. "Any 
favorite books?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah. I'm not a reader. I only read two books in my whole life and one was the 
official Pete Rose scrapbook." He looked suddenly serious, called me by name 
and said, "I'll never lie to you." I called him by name and said that he was 
lying. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's face darkened. He was not used to being contradicted. "You graduated 
from high school," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Took me five years." 
</P>
<P>
"Still you must have read more than two books." 
</P>
<P>
The face softened. "Uh-uh," he said. "Not books. Chapters." 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, it was difficult to envision a book with a self-proclaimed 
semiliterate. Rose said he wasn't going to tell sex stories about ballplayers 
on the road and I said who asked for any. "I betcha," Rose said, "Jim Bouton is 
sorry he told sex stories in 'Ball Four.' " 
</P>
<P>
"He's not sorry at all. He's proud of the book." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'll bet he's sorry he don't get asked to old-timers' games." 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have to tell stories about you," I said, uneasily. Rose went 
through a battering divorce and a page-one paternity suit. "I won't set the 
whole book at second base." 
</P>
<P>
"The divorce," Rose said, "is 100% my fault." On the suit, he said, "I never 
admitted paternity in court." 
</P>
<P>
Rose is a quick and sometimes witty man, but his grammar and vocabulary are 
shaky. I decided I would write the book in my voice. Pete could enter only in 
conversation. That took care of form and left me to puzzle out the content. 
</P>
<P>
Across a playing career without parallel, three incidents dominate. During the 
1970 All-Star game at Cincinnati, Rose had crashed into young Ray Fosse, a 
promising catcher who was blocking the plate. It was one rugged play. "Hey," 
Fosse explained when I telephoned him. "I knew what I was doing. The President 
of the United States was watching. Great players, Frank Robinson and Harmon 
Killebrew, were on my team. I wasn't gonna give it the ole." Pause. "I stood in 
there and boy, did Pete hit me a shot." 
</P>
<P>
Rose: "Nobody told me they changed it to girls' softball between third and 
home." 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Rose slid hard into Bud Harrelson, the Mets' shortstop, during the 
league championship series. Rose, 190 pounds, and Harrelson, perhaps 155, then 
pummeled each other on the ground. The New York press said Pete beat up a 
smaller man. 
</P>
<P>
Rose: "He called me a bad name. I don't like the word. It's the one that begins 
with a 'c'. So I hit him. What happens? Do I gotta do time?" 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after breaking Cobb's record, Rose glanced at the sky and began to 
weep. His son Petey, then the Reds' batboy, rushed toward him and the two 
embraced, the father, tough Pete Rose, crying hard. "When I looked up," Rose 
said, "I saw clear in the sky my dad and Ty Cobb. Ty Cobb was in the second 
row. Dad was in the first. With Dad in the sky and Petey in my arms, you had 
three generations of Rose men together that night. So that's what it was that 
made me cry." 
</P>
<P>
On the divorce . . . well, it was nasty. The first Mrs. Rose, Karolyn, said she 
would always love Pete and someday he would stop chasing and come back. 
Meanwhile, she needed $6,000 a month in alimony. At least the property split 
seemed equitable. Karolyn got a white Rolls. Pete got to keep a black Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
Rose settled the paternity suit out of court. That is, he paid. He could, he 
said, have made a defense but that meant describing the woman's sexual habits 
and fingering some teammates. Instead, he bit the bullet. He wanted no praise 
for that. Neither did he feel he warranted blame. 
</P>
<P>
Gambling? He liked ponies. And what was wrong with that? He could afford 
gambling. He never bet rent money. Bowie Kuhn had assigned baseball's top 
security men to investigate his gambling in 1978. Rose was exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
I have a favorite memory of a conversation I had with Rose: 
</P>
<P>
"I play baseball harder than anyone you ever saw," he told me. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie Robinson played hard as you." 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm the best hitter you ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
"That was Stan Musial in Ebbets Field." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the best baseball public relations man you ever met." 
</P>
<P>
"Casey Stengel." 
</P>
<P>
There was no anger, no upset. "You're entitled to your opinions. I'm just 
telling you what I think." 
</P>
<P>
Now life broke in, or Truth, with what Robert Frost called "all her matter of 
fact about the ice storm." One of my sons, fine athlete, poet, spring-training 
companion, took his life. 
</P>
<P>
The phone rang three days later. 
</P>
<P>
Rose: "That the boy I met? You didn't lose him. I swear to God you didn't lose 
him. He's up in the sky now, playing catch with my dad." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose can weep and so, I learned, can I. 
</P>
<P>
Kirshbaum telephoned and asked me to lunch. When I said I couldn't work on the 
book right then, that I was grieving, he hired lawyers and sued both me and 
Pete. "Hey," said an agent. "You got heavy stuff. Rose did his work. He'll 
cross-complain against you." 
</P>
<P>
Rose never did, would never allow it. Instead, he put a hand on my arm and told 
his own son, "This man lost his boy and has the strength to go on. I couldn't 
do that myself." 
</P>
<P>
"You could," I said. We settled the suit at great cost and found another 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Someone else who claimed to be a fan of Peter Edward Rose was Angelo Bartlett 
Giamatti, who showed up one spring training a-twinkle and bearded, under a 
large floppy hat. Rose was managing the Reds in his hands-on way, picking up 
baseballs near the batting cage, chattering, dominating the morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't he marvelous!" Giamatti said. We had met years before during a sports 
panel discussion at Yale. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing a book." 
</P>
<P>
"I know. It's going to be some trick for you, bottling up all that energy. But 
I envy you the time you spend with him." 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti possessed a wonderful gift for friendship and a glorious eloquence on 
many topics, including baseball. But what in the world was he doing as 
president of the National League? 
</P>
<P>
An umpire named Dave Pallone made a ninth-inning call against the Reds in 1988 
and Rose ran toward first base to argue. Pallone gesticulated and one of his 
fingernails nicked Rose's face. Rose bumped Dave Pallone twice. 
</P>
<P>
Sound umpiring practice dictates walking away from confrontation. Turn your 
back. March fifteen paces. Usually matters calm. To general surprise, Giamatti 
suspended Rose for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Most baseball men believed Rose's offense called for a penalty of three days. 
Rose appealed. Lawyer Katz advised him to wear a conservative suit. 
</P>
<P>
Rose walked into the hearing in a suit of luminous gray. It reflected low 
intensity desk lamps. "If they're gonna treat me like Capone, I'm gonna dress 
like Capone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti stuck to his call. He and Rose were on a juggernaut course that ended 
in tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Once I saw Pete place basketball bets from a spring-training clubhouse. "Should 
you be doing that?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
Pete gave a terse answer. "Everybody does." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody doesn't, but I had no sense of addictive gambling. Rose had plenty of 
money. He talked betting, but not incessantly. He seemed to be someone who 
would not accept limits on behavior, but he had broken through the limits in 
his profession. Why not break through in other areas as well? 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 20, 1989, Rose met in New York with Commissioner Peter Ueberroth and 
Giamatti, still president of the National League. Rose brought lawyers. He 
claims he was being shaken down by Paul Janszen, one of the old, unappetizing 
characters he ran with late in the 1980s. Ueberroth asked if Rose gambled and 
Rose said yes. He had lost $2,000 on the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball?" 
</P>
<P>
"I do not bet baseball, sir. I got too much respect for the game." 
</P>
<P>
"That's all I want to know," Ueberroth said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing ominous," Ueberroth was quoted in the New York Times as 
saying. "And there won't be any follow-through." That turned out to be a 
baseball equivalent of Neville Chamberlain's Munich statement that he had 
achieved "peace in our time." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Peters, a bookmaker from Franklin, Ohio, with a sideline cocaine business, 
contacted Sports Illustrated through a lawyer. Peters had been caught, 
convicted and needed money. He wanted to sell the magazine a story that he had 
booked Rose's sports bets, including bets on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Illustrated heard out Peters' lawyer, and declined to purchase the 
story. Instead, the magazine would follow up leads on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Word spread through spring training that Sports Illustrated had damaging 
charges against Rose and panic erupted in the offices of the baseball 
commissioner. Would Sports Illustrated break a story that Rose, color him hero, 
was a compulsive gambler, who might just possibly have bet baseball? 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely not. On the recommendation of Fay Vincent, the commissioner's office 
engaged a well-connected Washington lawyer named John Dowd, a former federal 
prosecutor renowned for his zeal. The announcement of baseball's investigation 
was issued on March 20; Sports Illustrated's story appeared a day later, but it 
had been defused. Tough John Dowd was in place, preserving the integrity of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Reuven Katz thought Pete and I should talk to the new publisher about delaying 
our book. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll sue us then," I said. 
</P>
<P>
The armies of Giamatti-Dowd were being arrayed against the forces of Katz-Rose. 
"But how are you supposed to write the history of World War II," Katz said, 
"with World War II still going on?" 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to help me," I said. "You and Pete." 
</P>
<P>
"The commissioner insists that everything stay confidential," Katz said. "We're 
not going to help you." 
</P>
<P>
"Confidential?" I said. "Follow the New York Times and CBS for leaks." 
</P>
<P>
I don't know whether Rose bet baseball, but I know this. Giamatti and Dowd 
played dirty pool with Pete. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd's hearing was set up as an "administrative procedure." Rose was not 
allowed to confront his accusers. His lawyers were not permitted to 
cross-examine them. In its post-Watergate panic, the commissioner's office was 
leaping back into the 1920s, when Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was able to 
throw out eight Chicago White Sox for throwing World Series games, although the 
players were acquitted by a jury. The 1920s was a Jurassic age for baseball 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, Rose turned over years of telephone records and bank statements 
to Dowd. Rose says he did that because he was innocent of betting baseball. 
Dowd dug and dealt. When Ron Peters, burned by Sports Illustrated, shut up, 
Dowd offered him a deal. If Peters told his story to Dowd, Giamatti would write 
the judge who was about to sentence Peters on felony charges. Peters took the 
deal. Giamatti wrote Judge Carl D. Rubin that Peters' statement -- Rose bet 
baseball -- was "candid, forthright and truthful." 
</P>
<P>
After that, Rose would not testify. He never would. Giamatti, he and Katz said, 
prejudged the case. 
</P>
<P>
After I studied the Dowd report, I thought not of Landis so much as former 
senator Joseph R. McCarthy. Consider page 233. "The testimony of Peters (and 
others) has been voluntary and forthright. None of them had anything to gain 
for this voluntary act of cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Peters had nothing to gain? Dowd cut a deal. If Peters talked, Dowd would write 
a letter to the judge who would be sentencing Peters for felony charges of drug 
dealing and tax evasion. Dowd would write the judge that Peters was "candid, 
forthright and truthful." Probably the sentence would be lightened. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was banned from baseball on Aug. 24. Our book appeared toward Thanksgiving 
to a somewhat hostile press. The best thing about its reception was that nobody 
sent me a letter bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Katz and Rose, now clearly desperate, wanted to manage the news, and sent the 
publisher a list of writers to whom they would speak. "You can't do that, 
fellers," I said. "Editors make the assignments. You'll just antagonize them 
more if you try to manipulate." 
</P>
<P>
A lot I knew. Rose was available for an exclusive New York area interview with 
a Times sports columnist named Ira Berkow. Rose liked to tell a friend that he 
could really handle Berkow and with him the New York Times. "I say, 'Ira, 
you're one writer who really knows baseball.' The stupid s.o.b. believes me." I 
laughed and repeated the story more than I should have. 
</P>
<P>
Berkow refused the exclusive interview. But he broke the release date and wrote 
in the New York Times, "there are voluminous taped phone calls between Rose and 
his gambling-associate-turned-chief-accuser, Paul Janszen . . . Kahn, who 
writes that he was going to get at the truth, never brings this matter up." No 
tapes, voluminous or otherwise, exist. Tapes? That's Richard (Library) Nixon; 
not Peter (Fifth Race) Rose. 
</P>
<P>
How long had Berkow and the New York Times covered Rose on the supposition that 
tapes proved he bet baseball? 
</P>
<P>
How long, oh Lord, how long? 
</P>
<P>
That was one aspect of the post-Watergate press. Wrongheaded stuff. Other 
aspects were miserable. Giamatti dies. Rose goes to jail. Baseball exposed its 
all-time hit leader to the kindly IRS folk who run your audits. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to Don Fehr, head of the Major League Players Assn., I say: "If Pete 
Rose were a player," I begin. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr: "Giamatti's outta there. He isn't neutral. We get an arbitrator. We put 
Dowd on the stand. We do our job." 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball says no," I say. "This new feller, Vincent, whoever he is, says no." 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking strike." 
</P>
<P>
Rose goes to jail. Dowd investigates Steinbrenner. What of Laurence Kirshbaum 
and Warner Books? 
</P>
<P>
Kirshbaum recently agreed to meet a national need and commission a sequel to 
"Gone With the Wind." The announced money dwarfs the offer to Rose and myself. 
I imagine corporate conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"In this version, guys, the Confederacy wins." 
</P>
<P>
I mean, who among us is right to judge Pete Rose?

After pressure by civil rights groups, the head of the all-white club that 
plays host to the Masters golf tournament said he hopes the club will invite 
its first black member this year. 
</P>
<P>
"That is our hope, yes," said Hord Hardin, chairman of Augusta National Golf 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't completed the procedures we normally follow yet, but it certainly 
is our desire that we will do it. I have every reason to believe that we will." 
</P>
<P>
Augusta National has not had a black member since it was founded by Bobby Jones 
in 1932. But the club recently came under pressure to integrate after similar 
protests against the all-white Shoal Creek Country Club in Alabama that is 
scheduled to play host to next month's PGA championship. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference threatened to lead an 
advertising boycott against the Masters next year if Augusta National continues 
to exclude blacks.

NEWSWIRE: ANDRIES WINS BACK TITLE . . . AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dennis Andries waited 13 months for revenge. On Saturday in Melbourne, 
Australia, he got it. 
</P>
<P>
Andries knocked out Jeff Harding in the seventh round to regain the World 
Boxing Council light-heavyweight title he lost to the Australian last year. 
</P>
<P>
Andries stunned Harding with a chopping right to the head, then knocked him out 
with an overhand right at 2:15 of the round. 
</P>
<P>
Andries, a Detroit-based Englishman, became only the second to win the light 
heavyweight title three times. 
</P>
<P>
"Three times man, I did it," Andries said after improving to 37-8-2. "I came to 
his back yard and did a demolition job." 
</P>
<P>
Andries, 36, also was champion in 1986-87 and 1989. Marvin Johnson is the only 
other three-time champion in the division.

Former USC offensive lineman Jeff Bregel, who came to the San Francisco 49ers' 
camp early and was expected to contend for a starting job at right guard this 
year, announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Bregel also walked out of summer camp last August, saying that his back was 
injured and that he wanted to retire. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to camp and started the first three games of the season before he 
was replaced by Guy McIntyre in the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
Bregel reacted by skipping practice and was suspended without pay Sept. 29. He 
was placed on injured reserve Oct. 4 because of his back and underwent disk 
surgery Nov. 28, finishing the season on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Bregel, a second-round draft pick in 1987, recently signed a contract and was 
scheduled to make $200,000 this season.

Impact: The Texas Rangers have had six sellouts this year, five with Nolan Ryan 
pitching and the sixth for a July 4 fireworks promotion. Ryan's 11 starts at 
Arlington Stadium have drawn an average paid attendance of 32,648, compared to 
23,974 for the club's other 38 dates. Said Ranger President Mike Stone on the 
night Ryan bid for his 300th victory: "The kinds of things he has done for this 
franchise in terms of national presence you just can't put a number on." 
</P>
<P>
How Do You Figure?: Boston Red Sox pitcher Mike Boddicker, 11-3 against the 
rest of the American League, is 0-3 against the Milwaukee Brewers, who have 
defeated him by scores of 18-0, 5-0 and 13-0. . . . Pittsburgh Pirate 
outfielder Bobby Bonilla, who batted .323 against Montreal last year, is one 
for 36 against the Expos this year with 19 strikeouts. . . . The Houston 
Astros, who have not had a losing season at home since 1975, the longest such 
streak in the major leagues, have won 21 of their last 30 at home this year for 
a 29-21 overall record but are 12-38 on the road (through Friday), where they 
have lost 25 of their last 28. 
</P>
<P>
Ghastly Boys: It was black Monday for the Atlanta Braves' bullpen. Joe Boever 
was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies; Joe Hesketh was released; Charlie 
Kerfeld was outrighted to the minors; and Doug Sisk, who has not pitched in the 
major leagues since 1988, was acquired from the New York Mets' triple-A farm 
club. Atlanta has used 15 relief pitchers this year, and not one has been on 
the varsity roster for the entire season. The Braves have blown 17 of 36 save 
opportunities, and no member of the current bullpen has more than one save, 
though left-hander Kent Mercker, 22, adapting to a relief role, is 4-1 since 
his recent recall. 
</P>
<P>
Real Relief: Doug Jones, with 27 saves and four victories Thursday, has shared 
in 66% of the Cleveland Indians' wins, giving him a shot at the major league 
record of 63.3%, set by the Kansas City Royals' Dan Quisenberry in 1983. . . . 
Dave Righetti of the New York Yankees is only the fifth reliever to register 20 
or more saves for five consecutive seasons. Bruce Sutter did it for nine years 
in a row and Goose Gossage for seven. Jeff Reardon and Lee Smith have a chance 
to extend streaks of eight and seven, respectively. . . . The Pirates, much 
like the Chicago White Sox, continue to thrive on bullpen by committee. Bill 
Landrum is the save leader with 12, but seven Pirates have one or more for a 
total of 28, third in the National League through Friday. Pirate relievers also 
have a cumulative record of 19-9. 
</P>
<P>
Met Muscle: New York continues to stockpile amazing numbers, particularly since 
the appointment of Bud Harrelson as manager, but this may be the most amazing: 
The Mets have collected 217 extra-base hits in their last 61 games and have 
failed to produce an extra-base hit only once all season. Darryl Strawberry, of 
course, has been the catalyst, hitting 21 homers and driving in 53 runs in a 
59-game spree. 
</P>
<P>
Equally Hot: That's Lonnie Smith, who has been throwing his weight around since 
shedding some winter tonnage. The comeback player of the year with Atlanta last 
year, Smith was batting .361 in his last 47 games through Thursday. And since 
moving to the leadoff position on June 3, Smith had hit in 24 of 30 games, 
batting .379. ROSS NEWHAN

THERE WAS NO EXCUSE FOR SCHROEDER'S SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: QUARTERBACK WAS HURTING IN 1989, BUT HE'S FEELING GOOD AND WORKING 
HARD NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Practice had been over for almost half an hour, but quarterback Jay Schroeder 
was still on the field. Although wide receivers Mervyn Fernandez and Sam Graddy 
wanted to end the session, Schroeder was determined to throw more passes. 
</P>
<P>
Mike White, the Raider quarterback coach, hopes Schroeder's work ethic will 
translate into a successful season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm impressed with Jay's attitude," White said. "I think he's made a real 
commitment to improve. If you've watched the last couple of days, he's still 
out after every practice and wants more work. He's looking for people to catch 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Mechanically, which is my role, he's improved, and now he's got to apply it to 
the system and get it polished up." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder suffered through a terrible season in 1989, losing his job to Steve 
Beuerlein. Schroeder, who completed only 46.9% of his passes, threw for 1,550 
yards with eight touchdowns and 13 interceptions. He was 4-5 as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't supposed to happen this way for Schroeder, acquired from the 
Washington Redskins in exchange for tackle Jim Lachey in 1988. Despite winning 
24 of 31 starts in Washington, Schroeder lost his job to Doug Williams and was 
traded to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Although Schroeder has been unsuccessful with the Raiders, they apparently 
haven't lost faith in him, signing him to a $1.1-million, one-year contract 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Is Schroeder out to prove that his first two seasons in Los Angeles were an 
aberration? 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a lot of pride and he wants to show people the kind of quarterback he 
is," White said. "He seems to be the kind of guy that accepts responsibility 
himself. And that's a start. He realizes that it's up to him. And in my 
experience with quarterbacks, that's important. One thing about quarterbacks is 
that no one wants to hear excuses." 
</P>
<P>
Although Schroeder suffered a torn rotator cuff in his left shoulder when he 
was blindsided by San Diego linebacker Leslie O'Neal on the first play of the 
Raiders' 1989 season-opener and said the injury never healed, he refused to 
offer that as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I never will make excuses," Schroeder said. "I played on a bad knee for a 
while, and I played with a bad shoulder. You're going to have injuries, but 
you've got to play. There's no sense complaining about it because nobody wants 
to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder moved from El Segundo to Poway over the winter, where he worked by 
himself to improve. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a lot of the training on my own because I know what I have to do to get 
ready," Schroeder said. "I worked on my dropbacks and my footwork." 
</P>
<P>
After losing 10 pounds, Schroeder, 6-4 and 210, hopes to have improved his 
quickness. 
</P>
<P>
Although he lost his job to Beuerlein last season, Schroeder has won it back by 
default, since a contract dispute has kept Beuerlein out of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
Does Schroeder think he will be able to retain the starting job once Beuerlein 
is signed? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about it," Schroeder said. "I'm not worried about who's No. 1. 
You're here to compete and that's all. This game is based on competition. 
You've got to do it every year." 
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfied with Schroeder's performance last season, there was speculation 
that the Raiders would try to trade for New Orleans quarterback Bobby Hebert. 
But the deal never took place. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter who's here," Schroeder said. "They can bring in anybody in 
the world, and if you get a fair shot, then it's on your shoulder. That's what 
I like about it. The bottom line rests with me. I have to do what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Lyle Alzado, who underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove torn 
cartilage from his left knee Friday, is expected to return in six weeks, said 
Dr. Robert Rosenfeld, who performed the surgery. "I went to the hospital this 
morning to see him, and they told me he had left," Rosenfeld said. "If he's 
walking around without crutches like I hear, his prognosis is good." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Art Shell was pleased after putting his team through a non-contact 
controlled scrimmage that was marred by penalties Saturday morning. "I'm 
satisfied with where we are and where we're headed," Shell said. "I feel good 
about our football team. I think our fans are going to see an exciting brand of 
football." . . . Tailback Marcus Allen, practicing for the first time since he 
ended his holdout Friday, had three carries for seven yards in the scrimmage, 
and quarterback Jay Schroeder threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver 
Tim Brown. . . . Although defensive end Greg Townsend had hoped to accompany 
the Raiders to London for their Aug. 5 exhibition against New Orleans, it now 
appears unlikely because he's still unsigned.

GRAY'S SAFETY IS RETURN TO DEFENSIVE ROOTS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER MAKING THE PRO BOWL TEAM AT CORNERBACK FOR FOUR SEASONS, 
RAM VETERAN GOES BACK TO THE POSITION HE PLAYED IN COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Gray has a confession. For five seasons he's been living a lie. He's 
masqueraded as a cornerback all these years with the Rams and only complicated 
his plight by making the Pro Bowl four consecutive times. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that was his first mistake. He became too good at the wrong job and was 
left to both succeed and die there. Gray was an All-American safety at the 
University of Texas and a first-round draft choice in 1985. When the Rams sent 
him to his corner as a rookie, Gray bit down hard on his lip and did what was 
asked, waiting for the day when the Rams would send him back to his rightful 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt like I was caged playing corner," Gray said. "I felt like I was 
limited to only one side of the field." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams say this is the season Gray returns to free safety. No fooling. They 
said it last year, too, but this time it's for real. The job changes have been 
posted. 
</P>
<P>
It's a gamble, sure. With Gray gone, the Rams are left to fight the league with 
one veteran cornerback -- Bobby Humphery -- and two players, A.J. Jackson and 
Darryl Henley, who are eager to make their first NFL starts. 
</P>
<P>
The temptation, of course, will be to move Gray back after the first bombs have 
been lobbed, although Coach John Robinson assures all that this is a leap of 
faith, not a whim. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going with the three corners," he said. "If we have injury or disaster 
hits us of any kind, natural or otherwise, we could go back to Jerry. I just 
can't tell you anymore than that." 
</P>
<P>
The problem with leaving Gray on the corner is that opponents can -- and have 
-- effectively removed him from action. 
</P>
<P>
In the days when LeRoy Irvin was in his prime, quarterbacks couldn't pick on 
one side or another. But last year, with Irvin fading, teams took full 
advantage, consistently throwing away from Gray's side of the field. After some 
games, they didn't need to wash his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
One Sunday against Green Bay last season, Gray remembers Packer star receiver, 
Sterling Sharpe, lining up on his side of the field just once in the game. 
</P>
<P>
At safety, Gray will play off the quarterback's eyes, not the receiver's, which 
leaves him freedom to roam either side of the field. 
</P>
<P>
Gray wants to become an intimidator on the level of San Francisco's Ronnie 
Lott, who protects cornerbacks with his mere presence. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, sounding a bit like Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath, said he wants his 
young cornerbacks to trust in him. 
</P>
<P>
"I want them to have the confidence to go, because I'll be there," Gray said. 
"On the post (pattern), I'll be there. On all the deep routes, if I'm in the 
middle, I'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
When Don Griffin and Tim McKyer were rookie corners for the (San Francisco) 
49ers in 1986, Lott was there for them, covering their mistakes and tracks. 
Gray hopes to do the same for Henley and Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"When they first came to San Francisco, they hadn't played anything," Gray said 
of the 49er pair. "They just threw them in the fire and said, 'Play.' But you 
got Ronnie Lott back there." 
</P>
<P>
Gray would like to believe that playing safety is something you never forget, 
like riding a bicycle. He knows that's not true, but he does have some time to 
work out the kinks. 
</P>
<P>
"I know corner, all the little odds and ends," he said. "I know how to cheat. 
That's what I have to learn playing safety. I have the ability to play safety, 
but I have to learn how to cheat, how to read the quarterback. Once you get 
that down, you got it. That's why I think Ronnie Lott's so good. He sits back 
and he's just as good as it gets, because he knows all the odds and ends." 
</P>
<P>
Gray, 27, hopes to be the glue that sticks his secondary together after last 
season's 28th ranking against the pass. Of course, some of that blame goes to 
the pass rush, which often gave opposing quarterbacks too much time to wait for 
receivers to get open. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the ranking is an eyesore for all Rams who knock down passes for a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I really don't do is look at the rankings," Gray said. "But you want 
to get it off your back. We beat New England, we beat Philadelphia, we beat the 
(New York) Giants. It really doesn't bother you unless they bring it up, then 
you say, 'I guess we really were that bad.' 
</P>
<P>
"But we were in the NFC championship game, too. What we don't want is everyone 
saying the offense is carrying the team. We want to have pride within 
ourselves. We don't want to have a war against our offense, either." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Gray's move to safety may hurt his chances for a fifth 
consecutive Pro Bowl appearance, which would have probably been a lock had he 
stayed on the corner. 
</P>
<P>
There are two reasons: Lott and Minnesota Viking safety Joey Browner. Barring 
injuries or a rare poor season, they figure to lock up the two starting spots, 
leaving Gray and others -- Chicago's Dave Duerson for one -- to fight for the 
remaining spot. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look at that as being the standard," Gray said. "I think I'm probably 
just as good as those guys. And there's room for one other guy. I think three 
guys go every year at safety. If you're good and you have good stats, you're 
going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Receiver Aaron Cox had a bad feeling before Friday's practice and after running 
only three routes, he was feeling lousy indeed. And by Saturday morning, bad 
had turned to worse. Cox, who injured his right hamstring during training camp 
last year and lost his starting job to Flipper Anderson, pulled the hamstring 
again Friday. Saturday morning, he found out that the injury was more serious 
than first diagnosed. Cox could be out as long as six weeks, according to Coach 
John Robinson. "My legs were feeling kind of stiff before the practice, so I 
did some extra stretching," Cox said. "Last year, I didn't want to accept it, 
but this time I handled it better. I went back in (the locker room) and got my 
stuff together and, after a few minutes, I was all right with it. You have to 
put something like this into perspective. There are a lot of people out there 
with worse problems than a pulled hamstring. Even if I never play another down 
in football, I've been blessed." 
</P>
<P>
Nose tackle Alvin Wright's quadriceps strain also has turned out to be more 
serious than the Rams first believed. He was originally scheduled to return to 
action Monday, but now will miss "at least a week," Robinson said. . . .

PRO FOOTBALL: FREE AGENCY; 
</P>
<P>
OPEN MARKET COULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though flawed by instances of club-owner collusion, the free-agent market has 
been good for baseball, a University of Illinois law professor observed 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
His research suggests, Stephen Ross said, that since 1976, free agency has 
furthered competitive balance in both leagues, spreading around some of the 
better ballplayers and enabling more teams to contend for pennants. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, if a free market came to the National Football League, he said, it 
would have the same effect on pro football -- helping the bottom clubs and 
increasing the quantity of title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Ross is a Los Angeles-born specialist in antitrust and sports law. A graduate 
of the University of California and its Boalt Hall law school, he is in his 
sixth year at Illinois after a tour in the Reagan Administration's Department 
of Justice. He has also worked on antitrust matters for Congressional 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
His views on free agency -- as expressed in a year of NFL player-owner 
antagonism -- aren't shared by the owners of the league's 28 teams. 
</P>
<P>
Their dispute with their 1,500 players -- a fight that has left pro football 
without a collective bargaining agreement for three years -- centers on free 
agency. And the heart of the problem is whether a free market would promote 
competitive balance. 
</P>
<P>
The players say yes, the owners no. 
</P>
<P>
The owners' principal stated objection to free agency, indeed, is that it would 
harm NFL competitive balance. 
</P>
<P>
At stake, the Illinois law school educator said, isn't what's best for the 
teams but for U.S. sports fans -- although they don't seem to realize it. 
</P>
<P>
"Most fans and (antitrust-case) judges tend to dismiss the (NFL's) free agency 
conflict as a silly fight between rich owners and rich players," Ross said. 
"But that is a basic misunderstanding of the facts. The issue that should most 
concern (the courts) and also the fans isn't just who gets the money but what 
happens to the game." 
</P>
<P>
And with free agency, he said, it's a better game for more teams and more fans. 
</P>
<P>
Question: What evidence supports that point of view? 
</P>
<P>
Ross: The turning point was the Andy Messersmith decision in 1975 -- the (case) 
that gave baseball players free agency. Since then, in every way you can 
measure balance, major league baseball has been more competitively balanced 
than it was in the years before Messersmith. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are some of the ways you measure such things? 
</P>
<P>
A: There have been closer pennant races. A larger number of different teams 
have won championships and division titles. Fewer teams have had losing 
seasons. There have been fewer pennant blowouts. In the seven years before 
Messersmith, you had 34 teams in the pennant races. In a comparable seven 
post-Messersmith years, you had 48. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How many were actually title-winners? 
</P>
<P>
A: In the seven years before Messersmith, 11 teams won all the division titles. 
Post-Messersmith, in the same number of years, 17 teams won titles. You had 
eight blowouts in the seasons just before Messersmith -- that is, eight teams 
winning by 10 or more games. Post-Messersmith, you had three. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Were those numbers reflected at the gate? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, from 1975 to 1985, attendance rose 57% in major league baseball. The 
thing that makes for the interest in sports -- the thing that makes the 
excitement in stadiums or on TV -- is the close fight, the close game, the 
close race. In team sports, the way to get more excitement and more fans is 
with a better balance among the competing teams. And more free agents mean more 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Pro football is a game in which draft choices also lead to more balance. 
</P>
<P>
A: The problem with the draft is that it limits the weaker teams to one pick in 
each round -- same as winning teams. The draft doesn't do as much for 
competitive balance as it could. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But it does help? 
</P>
<P>
A: Some, because the only two ways to improve an NFL team today are by drafting 
or trading. Trouble is, when 28 franchises share the best college talent, it 
takes a long time to draft a good team. The trouble with trading is that, 
normally, you have to give up a good one to get a good one. To get free agents, 
you only give up money. And you get immediate results. Building with free 
agents can be much faster than building with the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Faster and more costly. 
</P>
<P>
A: Revenues are shared in the NFL. Each of the 28 teams generates about the 
same amount of money. In a free market, what matters is who wants to spend that 
money for players and who doesn't. The irony is that while publicly advocating 
competitive balance, the NFL actually impedes the efforts of its weaker teams 
to improve. They are barred from spending for the free agents that could make 
them more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Even so, the NFL is proud of its competitive balance, which, it says, is 
basically due to its rules restricting free-agent mobility. 
</P>
<P>
A: To refute that notion, all you need is a statistical analysis of the seasons 
since the 1970 merger. In the 17 years through 1987, if all NFL teams were 
equal, each team would have made the (final four) 2.67 times -- that is, two or 
three times. Instead, the top eight franchises each got to the conference 
finals five times or more. Seven never got there. Only six of the 28 franchises 
went two or three times -- as would occur if the league were competitively 
balanced. 
</P>
<P>
Q: One NFL argument against free agency appeals to many critics. If the players 
were free, the NFL says, they would head for the big cities. Isn't it true that 
anyone would choose Los Angeles over Green Bay? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, I don't think that's true at all. It clearly isn't true of athletes. In 
the NFL especially, with their short careers, players have different 
priorities. The first priority for most is just to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In Green Bay? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sure, football players hate sitting on the bench. They would much rather 
start in Green Bay or Buffalo than sit around as a backup in Florida or 
California. Starters have more fun and make more money -- even in Green Bay. 
With TV and gate revenues shared, the Packers are on a level field financially 
with the Raiders or anybody. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But doesn't it stand to reason that, given a choice, most players would 
rather play for a winning franchise in a pleasant climate? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, the evidence shows that most football players are more interested in 
other kinds of things, such as who the coach is. Or the coach's philosophy. Or 
the geographical preferences of their families, who usually like to live near 
home. Or their own boyhood homes. When Ahmad Rashad was a free agent -- he was 
one of 12 in a fluke situation in 1976 -- he chose to play on a losing team, an 
expansion team, in Seattle, just because he likes Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Q: One more thing about NFL club owners. They contend that regardless of 
whether free agency works in baseball, it would be disruptive in football, 
which is more of a team game. Do you see that? 
</P>
<P>
A: Football is probably more of a team game, but that isn't what's relevant in 
player acquisition. The relevant thing is that you can only be competitive in 
any game with top-quality talent. And if you need, say, one or two key players 
to be a contender, the easiest and quickest way to get them is to buy them on 
the open market -- as the Dodgers did in 1988 when they bought the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, after an also-ran season in '87, the Dodgers were never going to make 
it all the way to the top in '88 if they hadn't brought in a key free agent, 
Kirk Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are you recommending a completely free market? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, no. The NFL should have many limitations on free agency -- limitations 
of the (following kind): 
</P>
<P>
 -- A rookie wage scale, to keep the clubs from throwing away money that 
belongs to veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A rule restricting free agency to players who have been in the NFL two or 
three years or four at most. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A rule prohibiting playoff teams from signing free agents or, perhaps, just 
limiting the number they can sign. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To help the bottom clubs in bidding wars, NFL revenue-sharing should be 
reformed to include luxury box income. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finally, 20% of total revenues should be subtracted and awarded at the end 
of the season to the winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How would that 20% be cut up? 
</P>
<P>
A: Say, 10% to the Super Bowl champion and the rest to the other playoff teams. 
Or you could subtract 50% of total revenues -- and award it on a declining 
basis to the first through the 28th best team. The idea is, the better you are, 
the more you make. The weakest teams ought to be losing money. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Aren't they? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not in pro football. The NFL's world is upside down. Most NFL losers make 
more money than winners because their payrolls are smaller. The league's real 
(money) winners are the teams with luxury boxes -- and that isn't in the best 
interests of sports fans. What we've got to do today is get somebody looking 
out for the fans, for the public. We've got to enlist the trial courts or the 
appellate courts -- or Congress. Somebody.

PREP FOOTBALL SHRINE GAME; 
</P>
<P>
NORTH MAKES THE BIGGER PLAYS, 19-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a game filled with big plays, the North needed three in the fourth quarter 
to pull out a 19-14 victory over the South in the Shrine all-star football game 
Saturday night before an estimated crowd of 3,000 at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
After seeing the South score its points on a 66-yard punt return by Charles 
Levy and a 17-yard touchdown pass from Jack Manu to Jason Green, the North 
called on its stars to shine in the game's final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
With 2:26 remaining and the South ahead, 14-13, the North's Steve Hines of 
Pittsburg started things off with a 46-yard punt return. Hines, who will attend 
Washington State in the fall, avoided three tacklers near his 20 and then 
weaved downfield to put the North into scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Hines also played a role in the North's next big play as he was on the 
receiving end of a key third-down, 13-yard pass play from quarterback Eric 
Bjornson of Oakland Bishop O'Dowd, taking the North to the South's 20. 
</P>
<P>
With 52 seconds left, the North capitalized on its last big effort when John 
Rushing of Merced, who scored twice, swept four yards for the winning 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"All game we were confident that we were going to win," Hines said. "We had to 
have some plays in the end and I just tried to get things happening with my 
punt return." 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood's Levy, who is headed to play quarterback at Arizona, said that the 
South simply wasn't able to stop the North's big plays in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense had a little trouble in the end and we just lost it on a couple of 
big plays," said Levy, who was named the South's most valuable player in 
accounting for 125 yards total offense. 
</P>
<P>
After Rushing's score, the South went to Trabuco Hills' Tim Manning at 
quarterback and rallied past midfield on completions to Jeremy Smith of Bishop 
Amat and Michael Ross of Carson. Their rally fell short, however, giving the 
North its second win in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the circumstances get to you and you lose a game," said Paramount 
Coach Ken Sutch, who along with Jim Barnett of Trabuco Hills directed the South 
team. "It's frustrating, but the kids gave it a good effort." 
</P>
<P>
When Levy scored on a punt return less than a minute into the game, the South 
appeared to be headed for its second consecutive easy victory, having won last 
year's matchup, 23-7. 
</P>
<P>
However, the North quickly answered by driving 80 yards to tie the game on a 
three-yard run by Rushing. Running back Deon Strother of Oakland Skyline gained 
36 yards in the drive. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its big plays, the North was outgained in total offense, 305-265.

TENNIS ROUNDUP;

CHANG HEATS UP, WEARS DOWN SAMPRAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Eighteen-year-old Californians Michael Chang and Pete Sampras battled for three 
hours under a scorching midday sun Saturday before Chang prevailed, 3-6, 7-6 
(7-5), 7-5, in the semifinals of the Players International tournament at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, winner of the 1989 French Open, hasn't won a regular men's tour event. 
In today's final, he will face fourth-seeded Jay Berger, who endured 90-degree 
temperatures to outlast unseeded Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland in the other 
semifinal, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"The French Open added pressure on me to perform and this summer, I don't have 
that pressure," said Chang, who has also had to overcome a hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth-seeded Sampras said he blew the match in the last two sets. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have won," said Sampras, who made 35 unforced errors to Chang's 17, 
the most critical in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
Chang won a second-set tiebreaker with the help of a "lucky" backhand return of 
an overhead smash, but Sampras regained the momentum with a break in the second 
game of the third set and took a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Chang held serve for 3-1 and held a break point on Sampras in the fifth game. 
When Sampras missed a backhand volley, Chang had a vital service break. 
</P>
<P>
"Till then, I thought I was pretty much gone," Chang said. "I didn't have a 
whole lot of chances to break him and when I did, he came up with that huge 
serve of his." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, a first-time winner in Philadelphia earlier this year, called the shot 
"stupid." 
</P>
<P>
"It took the air right out of me," he said. "I didn't know where I was on the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
Zina Garrison and Jennifer Capriati posted straight-set victories as the United 
States advanced to the final for the 19th time in the 28th Federation Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The defending champion and top-seeded Americans beat third-seeded Austria, 3-0, 
and will meet the fourth-seeded Soviet Union, a 2-1 winner over second-seeded 
Spain in the other semifinal match at Norcross, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets took advantage of an injury to Spain's No. 1 player, Arantxa 
Sanchez-Vicario, who retired in the second set of her singles match with a 
twisted ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison, ranked fifth in the world, defeated Judith Wiesner, 6-3, 6-4, to 
clinch the victory for the U.S., after Capriati beat Barbara Paulus, 6-3, 6-4.

POTTER'S 'DO A QUEST FOR LUCK; 
</P>
<P>
SURFING: DEFENDING CHAMPION GOING INCOGNITO. HE HAS HAD TROUBLE LIVING UP TO 
HIS REPUTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gone are the long, blondish-brown locks and the scruffy beard that surfing fans 
saw so often on the victory stand last season but have seen so little since. 
</P>
<P>
The way defending world champion Martin Potter figured it, a change in 
appearance would change his fortunes. After finishing no higher than third in 
his first four competitions this season, the surfer from Newquay, England, made 
a trip to the barber shop. 
</P>
<P>
Surfing with a new look and a new attitude, Potter won for the first time this 
season two weeks ago in the Life's a Beach contest at Oceanside. He's hoping 
for similar results in the Op Pro Surfing Championships, which begin today at 
the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm traveling incognito," Potter said of his clean shave and tightly cut 'do. 
"I was becoming too recognizable in Australia. Besides, the hair kept getting 
in my way. It was slowing me down." 
</P>
<P>
So was a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
Potter dislocated his shoulder six weeks before competing in Oceanside and 
struggled to third-, fifth- and two 17th-place finishes. But he was back in 
familiar territory in Oceanside, defeating Sunny Garcia in the final and moving 
up to seventh in the overall point standings with 5,008. 
</P>
<P>
His bad start has left him nearly 1,600 points behind leader Rob Bain of Manly, 
Australia. At this time last season, Potter, 26, had won five of the first six 
events and was running away with the title. 
</P>
<P>
"I've put too much importance on being the world champion," said Potter, who 
led the tour in victories last year with six. "It seems like now I'm going out 
to defend titles. I'm letting the world-title stigma get to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally got what I wanted: the title. Now I'm walking around, stressing 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
At least until his next trip to the barber . . . 
</P>
<P>
Like Potter, defending women's world champion Wendy Botha also has been 
battling injuries. 
</P>
<P>
She missed the first stop on the tour at Santa Cruz while undergoing 
arthroscopic surgery to repair ligament and cartilage damage in her right knee. 
Botha, of Sydney, Australia, injured her knee while surfing three days before 
the March competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pulling out of a tube ride, and my knee bent (sideways)," Botha said. 
"It sounded like I broke my leg. It snapped real loud. I guess I was lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors gave Botha two options after the injury. She could undergo 
reconstructive surgery right away or have arthroscopic surgery and postpone the 
major surgery until the season ends in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Botha chose the latter. The reconstructive surgery requires several weeks of 
rehabilitation, and Botha figured she could have the operation and rest during 
the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Now that she's back in the water, the injury hasn't slowed her much. 
</P>
<P>
Surfing with a knee brace, she won the Coke event and was third in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
She's moved up to fifth in the point standings and hopes a strong showing in 
the Op Pro competition will keep her in the chase for another world title. 
</P>
<P>
"I've surfed with a lot of pain in my first three events," said Botha, who won 
the Op Pro event in 1987 and was fifth last year. "I fell behind because I 
missed the first contest. Any event in the beginning is important. Lisa 
(Andersen) and Pam (Burridge) have done well early, but I've won one coming off 
a pretty bad injury." 
</P>
<P>
With defending champion Kelly Slater now competing on the pro circuit, the Op 
junior amateur competition could be wide-open. 
</P>
<P>
Favorites this year include Rob Machado of Cardiff, who finished second to 
Slater last year, and Jeff Deffenbaugh, the defending U.S. amateur champion.

Four qualifying rounds in the Op junior will begin today at 6:30 a.m. Boys and 
girls will compete together in 20-minute heats. The semifinals and finals are 
next Saturday. The winner will receive a trophy and a $1,000 scholarship.

<P>
A hurricane off the southwest coast of Mexico created 10-foot waves at 
Huntington last week, and surfing forecasters hope a similar storm will help 
the Op Pro competition this week. 
</P>
<P>
Surfers have complained about the one- to four-foot waves the last two years. 
But forecasters say two southwest swells this week should keep waves between 
three to five feet with occasional seven-footers.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: AGENT SHOULD WRITE PURCHASE OFFER ACCORDING TO BUYER'S 
SPECIFICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Robert J. Bruss, a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and 
real estate broker 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My husband and I are house hunting. I've kept count, and we have 
inspected 16 houses so far. Last weekend we found one we wanted to buy. 
</P>
<P>
However, the realty agent was more of an obstacle than a help. She thought our 
offer price was too low, but we pointed out several neighborhood sales at about 
that price, so she finally agreed to our price. We also insisted on a termite 
inspection and a professional inspection to which she reluctantly agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Then, we insisted that our offer be contingent on our obtaining a fixed-rate 
mortgage on specific terms. We have already prequalified and showed her our 
certificate, but she said then we didn't need a finance contingency clause. 
When I insisted on it, she got angry. Finally, my husband lost his cool and we 
both walked out. However, we still want to buy that house. What should we do? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: There are a zillion real estate agents who would love to write up your 
purchase offer. You were absolutely correct to insist on your offer price, the 
inspections and the specific mortgage finance contingency clause. Knowing how 
emotional a home purchase can be, I admire your courage to walk out on that 
obnoxious real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
A few bad apples like that give all the other excellent real estate agents a 
tarnished image. You are absolutely correct, she was an obstacle to the home 
sale rather than a help. Unfortunately, the home seller probably doesn't know 
that agent is an important reason the home hasn't sold. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest you find another agent to prepare your purchase offer. If necessary, 
go to the manager of the listing agent's office. He or she will solve your 
problem. Realty agents are supposed to promote property sales, not prevent 
them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defer Tax on Home for Apartment Trade 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have owned our home many years. If we sell it, our profit will be about 
$200,000, so that "over-55 rule" $125,000 home sale tax exemption won't help 
much. Our idea is to somehow sell our home and buy an apartment building where 
my husband and I will manage the building. 
</P>
<P>
He is very handy and can handle the repairs, whereas I will enjoy managing the 
building by renting the apartments and doing the bookkeeping. Is there any way 
we can pull this off without paying tax on our home sale? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. But first I must explain an Internal Revenue Code 1031 tax-deferred 
exchange only applies to "like kind" real estate held for investment or use in 
a trade or business. 
</P>
<P>
That means your personal residence cannot qualify. But you can first move out 
and rent it to tenants, thus converting it to like kind property. Then you can 
trade it for apartments or any other like kind property such as offices, 
warehouses, shopping centers, or even vacant land. 
</P>
<P>
However, nobody knows the answer to your next question which is how long must 
the house be rented before it can be traded for apartments? Most tax advisers 
suggest renting it at least six to 12 months before exchanging. Please consult 
your tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Buyer's Bounced Check Not a Good Sign 
</P>
<P>
Q: Since homes have been selling slowly in our city we were overjoyed when our 
realty agent finally brought us an acceptable purchase offer. We also were 
pleased with the $5,000 earnest money deposit check. 
</P>
<P>
However, a few days later the agent phoned to say the buyer's out-of-town check 
bounced. When the agent phoned the out-of-town buyer the phone number turned 
out to be a wrong number. The realty agent calls the buyer's bank every day, 
but is told the buyer's account has insufficient funds to cover the $5,000 
check. This has been going on over two weeks. Do you think we should give up 
and put the house back on the market for sale? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The buyer is in breach of contract and would have a very difficult time 
enforcing the purchase contract if he reappears. But shame on the real estate 
agent for not checking out the buyer and getting the buyer's out-of-town 
address, so inquiry could be made there as to the buyer's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should Home Buyer Sell or Keep Old House? 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have contracted to buy a new house under construction nearby. It will be 
finished in two months. We can either sell our old home to raise the down 
payment or keep the house, add a second mortgage for the down payment and rent 
it to tenants. If we keep the old house we will have a negative cash flow of 
about $150 per month. It is in a good location and we think it will continue to 
appreciate in market value. Should we sell or keep our old home? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can never own too much real estate, especially if it is well-located and 
appreciating in market value. Since your current home is near your new home, 
you can easily supervise the tenants. If you can handle that negative cash flow 
I recommend holding on to your old home instead of selling it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreclosure Can Pay for Owner-Lender 
</P>
<P>
Q: To get our home sold, we had to carry back a $24,000, 10-year second 
mortgage for our buyer. As we are moving from the area, I am concerned the 
buyer might not make her monthly payments and we might have to foreclose. If 
that happens, what should we do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Foreclose is the best thing that can happen to a second mortgage lender. If 
your buyer defaults, after about 30 days you should contact the realty agent 
who handled your home sale. He or she can recommend a local attorney or other 
qualified person to handle the foreclosure for you. 
</P>
<P>
If there are no bidders to pay off your loan at the foreclosure sale, then you 
get the home back to sell for a second profit. Instead of fearing foreclosure, 
you should consider it an added benefit of selling your home. But please don't 
get your hopes up because less than 1% of home loans go to foreclosure sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Borrower Should Get a Copy of Appraisal 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I are refinancing our home loan to switch to a fixed-rate 
loan and take out some tax-free equity cash. Our current lender offered us a 
good loan, but wanted us to pay a $250 appraisal fee which we stupidly paid. 
</P>
<P>
However, the appraisal came in about $15,000 below what a similar home sold for 
last month just a few blocks from our house. To make matters worse, the lender 
wouldn't let us see the appraisal for which we paid. Thankfully, we found a 
better loan with another lender who didn't even charge us an appraisal fee. I 
feel we got ripped off for $250, don't you? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Any borrower who is asked to pay an appraisal fee should pay the fee 
only with the understanding that the borrower will be given a copy of the 
appraisal. There is no valid reason for a lender not giving the borrower a 
copy, except to conceal a faulty appraisal. If I were in your situation I would 
sue the lender for the $250 in small claims court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mortgage Broker Breaks Loan Promise 
</P>
<P>
Q: I should have taken your advice to another reader several months ago. You 
warned her to be very wary of mortgage brokers who often promise loan terms 
that later prove to be unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
I stupidly listened to the saleswoman who sold me my condo. She recommended a 
local mortgage broker who, she said, was wonderful. But about a week before the 
scheduled closing, the mortgage broker told me the lender refuses to make a 
loan on the condo complex because it was not "pre-approved," whatever that 
means. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was unable to obtain another lender who will loan on the condo I 
wanted to buy. Fortunately, I had the presence of mind to walk about three 
blocks to an S&amp;L branch where the manager said her S&amp;L would be glad to 
make the loan to me. 
</P>
<P>
Although the closing had to be delayed about a week, I got my mortgage and am 
happily moved in my condo. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thank you for sharing your experience which, unfortunately, is too typical 
of some mortgage brokers who promise more than they can deliver. 
</P>
<P>
I realize they are middlemen caught between the lender and the borrower. Often 
the mortgage broker has no control over the lender's decision to change loan 
terms or refuse to make a loan. But mortgage brokers shouldn't mislead 
borrowers into thinking their loan is a firm commitment if it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Buyer Benefits by Dealing With Agent 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our town seems to have an oversupply of homes for sale. My husband and I are 
looking for a home to buy for our growing family. If we limit our search to 
homes being sold directly by their owners, do you think we can get the seller 
to reduce the price by the amount of the sales commission that doesn't have to 
be paid? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. The value of a home is determined by the marketplace, not by real estate 
agents. A few home sellers try to sell their homes without a real estate agent 
because they think they are saving the sales commission. 
</P>
<P>
But the truth is they are working very, very hard to get their homes sold. Do 
you think they will pass that sales commission savings on to the buyer? Very 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Realty agents perform valuable services to both buyers and sellers. If they 
didn't, sellers wouldn't hire them. As a home buyer, it costs you no more to 
buy a home through a real estate agent than directly from the seller. A realty 
agent has hundreds of homes to show you, but a do-it-yourself seller has only 
one. 
</P>
<P>
After you find the right home, the realty agent will help negotiate the sales 
price and terms. Then the agent will recommend mortgage lenders and help obtain 
the loan you need. Finally, the agent arranges the 1,001 details of the sale 
closing. 
</P>
<P>
All this service costs you nothing extra, but it can save you many headaches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Determine Fair Market Rent for Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife has a great job opportunity in London. Since I am a writer and can 
work anyplace, I have agreed to the move which should last about two years. We 
have decided to keep our home and rent it to tenants while we are gone. How can 
we determine the fair market rent? 
</P>
<P>
A: Local rental market conditions determine the rent you can obtain for your 
home. The quickest way to determine rents of nearby homes is to read the 
classified ads under "Homes for Rent." Phone a few owners to learn if their 
homes are truly comparable to yours. You will rapidly determine the fair market 
rent for your home. 
</P>
<P>
Your next step is to begin interviewing prospective tenants. One way is to 
phone a local realtor who specializes in rentals and list your home for rent. 
However, you may prefer to rent the house yourself by advertising it in the 
local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
I have been very fortunate using both methods. But I do enjoy the special 
service the best rental agents give, such as screening applicants, eliminating 
the unqualified prospects, checking their credit and income, and making the 
rental task easy. Of course, rental agents do this in return for a handsome 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sell or Remodel Home, Which Is Better? 
</P>
<P>
Q: We own a small home in a nice neighborhood. But it has only two bedrooms and 
we need four. My husband thinks we should remodel and add two bedrooms. He 
obtained estimates and we can swing the cost with the help of an equity 
credit-line loan. 
</P>
<P>
But we realize it will involve about six months of mess. Our other alternative 
is to buy a larger home. However, the only ones we can afford are way out in 
the boondocks and the schools there are not the best. What do you advise? 
</P>
<P>
A: I recommend that you remodel your current home. This is usually the least 
expensive and most profitable choice. Since you like your current neighborhood, 
that is a major advantage as compared to moving to an untried area. Perhaps you 
have noticed the remodeling boom. This shows other people have faced the same 
choice you did and they elected to stay and remodel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Worry If Price Appreciates Slowly 
</P>
<P>
Q: My parents, in their early 70s and retired, live in a small town. Last week 
mom sent me a clipping from the local newspaper which said homes prices there 
have only gone up 3.5% in the last year. They are debating whether to sell and 
move to a warmer climate or stay where they are. 
</P>
<P>
The town is neither growing nor declining. It is a very nice place and I 
enjoyed growing up there. I would hate to see my parents move away from their 
friends, but they are concerned about their home value because it is their 
major asset. What do you advise? 
</P>
<P>
A: When I started investing in real estate, in the 1960s, I recall a real 
estate agent told me homes in the area where I bought my first property 
appreciated 3% annually. We thought that was terrific. There is nothing wrong 
with a modest appreciation rate. Of course, a higher rate would be better. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that you and your parents watch the economic climate in their small 
town very carefully. If it starts to decline, that is the time to sell. Since 
they are happy there, I suggest they stay unless some unfavorable factor 
indicates they should sell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Deduction for Lost Money Deposit 
</P>
<P>
Q: We offered to buy a 12-unit apartment building. With our purchase bid we 
made a $5,000 earnest money deposit. However, we learned more about the 
building and decided not to buy, as we decided apartments are not the right 
investment for us. 
</P>
<P>
The seller and realtor refuse to refund our $5,000 because we breached the 
contract. We understand that. But can we deduct our $5,000 loss on our income 
tax returns? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Since this was to be a business or investment property, your lost 
earnest money deposit qualifies as a deductible business expense. However, if 
you had lost the deposit on the purchase of a personal residence then it would 
not be deductible. Please consult your tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Make Offer Acceptance Only for Short Time 
</P>
<P>
Q: We offered to buy a home. The realtor wrote on the offer bid that our offer 
was to be good for seven days. Frankly, I didn't read that part very carefully. 
After a few days I called the realtor and she said the seller was considering 
our offer. 
</P>
<P>
When a week had gone by I called the realtor, since she had not called us. She 
reported there was another slightly better offer coming in from another buyer 
and she wondered if we could raise our bid by $4,500. I was so angry I told her 
to forget it. Now I realize our agent was trying to get us to offer more for 
the house. Next time, what should we do differently? 
</P>
<P>
A: Don't make your purchase offer valid for such a long time. Unless the seller 
is out of town, an offer bid valid for one day is usually sufficient. A short 
time for purchase offer acceptance puts pressure on the seller to either accept 
or counteroffer your bid. The one-week acceptance time in your purchase offer 
was an invitation for "offer shopping" which is what the seller did. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Get Action on Slow-Selling House 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own a house that I have had listed for sale over three months. The asking 
price is reasonable, based on comparable sales, but I haven't had any good 
purchase offers yet. There is no mortgage on the house, so I can be very 
flexible. Some time ago I recall you said a lease-option can get action on any 
house. How should I advertise my house on a lease-option to get some action? 
</P>
<P>
A: Just run my famous classified ad under both "houses for rent" and "houses 
for sale" in the newspaper want ads. Pay extra to have the first line in big 
bold type such as: "$5,000 Moves You In! Lease with option to buy. Half your 
rent applies to down payment. Beautiful 3 BR, 2 BA home, family room. Great 
neighborhood. $1,500 per month. Call Mark at 999-9999." 
</P>
<P>
Then stay home and get ready for your phone to ring. Or do as I do and don't 
list your phone number, but just say in the ad "Open Sunday 1-3 p.m." and 
include the address. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you get greedy and charge too much for the non-refundable option money 
or the rent, you will have lots of action on your house.

SPEAKING OUT: L.A. HEART'S FAILURE: WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES LOCKWOOD, Lockwood is the author of seven books on American 
architecture and cities, as well as many magazine articles on the subjects. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New office towers are rising on Figueroa Street, opposite the Public Library 
and on Bunker Hill. The first new downtown luxury hotel in decades recently 
opened on Grand Avenue. Apartment buildings stand on Bunker Hill and in South 
Park. The Metro Rail subway is under construction and the Long Beach light rail 
line is operating. 
</P>
<P>
At last, the renaissance of downtown Los Angeles is complete. Or is it? Like it 
or not, the answer is no. Where are all the people? 
</P>
<P>
At lunch time, many sidewalks are eerily uncrowded for an office district with 
300,000 workers. On weekends, only Broadway is busy. 
</P>
<P>
The Flower-Figueroa Corridor, 7th Street and Pershing Square are virtually 
deserted except for panhandling derelicts and disappointed tourists who 
expected to find the excitement of mid-town Manhattan or downtown San Francisco 
in the middle of the nation's second largest city. 
</P>
<P>
Why do Angelenos avoid downtown? Because the public and private sectors, which 
launched the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s, overlooked several 
people-pleasing ingredients that are essential to any successful downtown. 
</P>
<P>
What people-oriented actions will complete the renaissance of downtown Los 
Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
First, and foremost, downtown must become more "pedestrian friendly" -- in 
other words, safer, cleaner and more inviting. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, many office workers will not leave their high-rise cocoons at lunch. 
And Southern Californians will avoid downtown Los Angeles in the evenings and 
on weekends, and instead will drive to Melrose Avenue, Westwood or Venice for 
shopping, entertainment and strolling. 
</P>
<P>
To make downtown more pedestrian-friendly will require reduction in crime, 
drugs and homelessness. That will take time, and cost more money than Angelenos 
have been willing to spend so far. 
</P>
<P>
But other quicker and less expensive measures can make downtown streets more 
inviting: 
</P>
<P>
Put a few more cops on the beat, widen sidewalks instead of streets, plant more 
trees along the curbs, install street lighting designed for pedestrians not 
just motorists, invite food vendors and flower kiosks to otherwise-empty plazas 
in front of office buildings, encourage the opening of more restaurants and 
theaters that attract people at night and on weekends, and transform Pershing 
Square from an open-air flophouse into a usable park for all Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
Don't say that we lack the money for these actions. A city government and 
business community that spent billions of dollars to rebuild downtown Los 
Angeles over the past decade can afford to protect its investment by following 
these recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The second people-pleasing ingredient now missing in downtown Los Angeles is an 
exciting and varied shopping district. No activity attracts more people or 
gives a downtown more vitality than shopping. Just look at the streets around 
Union Square in downtown San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
At present, downtown Los Angeles boasts Broadway, the busiest downtown shopping 
district west of Chicago and north of Mexico City. But Broadway's appeal is 
limited, because it stocks low-priced merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the downtown retail district falls short of its potential, despite 
the presence of the Broadway, Bullock's, May Co. and Robinson's. Only 8% of 
downtown office workers go shopping during lunch time, compared to 33% in 
Boston or Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
To strengthen downtown shopping, the city must create a retail plan for 
downtown Los Angeles, besides making the streets safer, cleaner and more 
inviting. Almost every American city has plans to encourage the development and 
continued success of its downtown retail district. Why doesn't Los Angeles have 
them? 
</P>
<P>
Any retail plan must include the revival of 7th Street, once downtown Los 
Angeles' counterpart to Manhattan's Fifth Avenue with its department stores, 
which now suffer from empty storefronts and office vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its four department stores, 7th Street has the right scale, the right 
length, the right pedestrian character for a successful retail corridor. And it 
has a concerned retail and business community that recently formed the Seventh 
Street Associates to gain improvements from the city and other government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Third, downtown Los Angeles needs more residents whose presence will attract 
more shops, restaurants and entertainment, thereby, creating a vibrant 
nighttime and weekend community. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the city must rethink its current policies about downtown 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
So far, most new downtown housing has been high-cost high-rise units, which 
have met with limited success because affluent Angelenos aren't ready to trade 
Brentwood for Bunker Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the city should encourage the construction of moderately priced rental 
housing on the edges of downtown. These apartments should be targeted toward 
young professionals who have not accumulated the down payment for a house, have 
no children and enjoy downtown's ethnic diversity and sense of urbanity. 
</P>
<P>
Given the opportunity, plenty of young professionals are eager to be downtown 
pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, dozens of downtown office workers and professionals tried to 
buy apartments in the 180-unit Villa Montoya, a city-subsidized low-rise 
complex at 12th and Union streets just west of the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these purchases fell out of escrow because the would-be purchasers 
earned more than the city-mandated $33,000 a year maximum income per household. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the city and downtown business community must consider the importance 
of "linkages," or functional connections between buildings and the streets, and 
between various downtown districts. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than turn inward like the Bonaventure Hotel or Arco Plaza's underground 
shopping mall, buildings must strengthen the surrounding streetscape by adding 
retail shops to their ground floor space and creating pleasant outdoor places 
where people can mingle or simply relax. 
</P>
<P>
This can be done. Look at Citicorp Plaza's Seventh Street Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
In a larger context, linkages must be encouraged between downtown's various 
districts. Any downtown's whole is always greater than the sum of its 
individual parts. 
</P>
<P>
This can be done, too. The renovations of the Grand Central Market, Bradbury 
Building and Million Dollar Theatre will connect the sterile City Hall district 
with bustling Broadway. Angel's Flight, if ever put back in operation, would 
link Broadway with Bunker Hill and create a splendid tourist attraction as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
As downtown Los Angeles enters another decade of building boom, isn't it time 
to complete its renaissance by adding these long-overlooked people-pleasing 
ingredients? 
</P>
<P>
The winners will include the city, downtown companies and professional firms, 
which must attract talented employees, and several hundred thousand Angelenos 
who work or live downtown. 
</P>
<P>
What are we waiting for?

'PROFIT' AND 'EQUITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Campbell and your reader were both misled by the word profit. Profit is the 
selling price, less the original price paid, less selling expenses. Accelerated 
payments are really a form of indirect savings and not increased profits. 
</P>
<P>
By accelerating their payments the young couple are giving up other 
opportunities for using that money. Let us assume one of these is putting the 
$100 each month in a savings account earning 5% per year. After five years, 
they will have $6,800 in this account. This is $943 less than accelerating 
payments against the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
A second choice would be to accelerate payments against debt that is costing 
them 12% year, say a car loan. On the same basis as the mortgage acceleration, 
after five years, the debt would be reduced by $8,167. This is better by $424 
against the mortgage option. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three options, the best opportunity is to accelerate the car loan 
payments.

 When in his question my letter writer used the word "profit" when he clearly

 Despite the fact that I subsequently bracketed "profit" in quotes as a 
reminder to myself that is was the reader's word, not mine, and that this was 
where the clarification should be inserted, it somehow wasn't done. It didn't 
blunt the validity of the point being made: That a relatively modest 
acceleration of principal payments over a five-year period can have a dramatic 
impact on the amount of cash equity available for the down payment on a 
replacement home of equal or greater value than the one being sold -- and on 
which there is therefore no tax consequence. But it's true that in my desire to 
make this point, the distinction between "profit" and "equity" got lost in the 
shuffle.

Profit (in this instance) as any schoolchild could tell Campbell, is the sales 
price less the selling expenses and the cost price (including any costs of 
improvement). Period.

SPACE FULL? LET EPIPHYTES CLIMB THE WALLS; 
</P>
<P>
PLANTS: THEY ARE IDEAL WHEN YOUR GARDEN RUNS OUT OF SPACE, BECAUSE THEY CAN 
CLING TO WALLS OR FENCES. BESIDES, THEY REQUIRE LITTLE WATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are times when a garden is so chock full that space simply can't be found 
for another plant -- frustrating our desire to try something new. And, there 
are places in the garden where there simply isn't room for anything in the 
ground -- frustrating narrow spaces in side yards or behind buildings. 
</P>
<P>
During those times, and in those places, consider taking to the air with any of 
the plants that are called epiphytes. 
</P>
<P>
Epiphytes are plants that take their sustenance from the air, gathering enough 
water from rain or fog, using whatever falls their way for food. They are 
usually attached to another plant, but they are not parasites, and some simply 
attach themselves to cliffs or rocks. This is primarily what their roots are 
for -- holding on; leaves do most of the gathering of water and nutrients, 
though roots contribute. 
</P>
<P>
Epiphytes are not usually grown in pots but attached to slabs of woods, tree 
fern fiber or bark, and they can simply be hung on a wall, fence or patio post. 
This is what makes them valuable plants in the garden, because not much else 
will grow on these surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
Epiphytes have something else going for them -- they need little water. In 
general, the watering of epiphytes can hardly be called "watering" at all since 
they are simply sprinkled quickly with the hose, just enough to get them wet. 
The best time of the day is early in the morning, and if you want exuberant 
growth and no maintenance, consider putting is a drip system that is equipped 
with little mist nozzles instead of the usual emitters. 
</P>
<P>
These provide just the right amount of water and a clock can control them. 
Watering every three days is about right for most epiphytes, though inland they 
might need more and close to coast, less. In a pinch, most can go for weeks 
without water. 
</P>
<P>
This is how Paul Isley waters his personal collection of epiphytic tillandsias, 
the most "drought-resistant" of bromeliads. Striking in their gray foliage, 
these are becoming readily available at nurseries, though at Isley's Rainforest 
Flora, a nursery that specializes in tillandsias, you can pick through bins 
filled with these bromeliads, most of which are raised from seed on the 
premises. 
</P>
<P>
One particularly fun use for tillandsias is on patio posts, where they can be 
seen up close. A single post can hold a whole collection if it faces in the 
right direction; tillandsias need full sun. 
</P>
<P>
They need infrequent watering and you can tell when a tillandsia is too dry 
because they begin to roll up their leaves. The best way to water at that point 
is to drop them in a bucket of water for a few hours so they can soak up all 
they need. Otherwise, water every few days with a quick blast from the hose, 
followed by another when the leaves dry. One sprinkle is not enough because 
they do not have time to take the water in before it evaporates. 
</P>
<P>
Staghorn ferns are another epiphyte. Every north wall in the milder parts of 
Southern California should have at least one staghorn fern, if for no other 
reason than to knock the socks off of out-of-state visitors. Staghorn ferns are 
simply spectacular once they get a few years behind them. The most common kinds 
form clumps of shields and antler-like leaves 3 or 4 feet across. They can be 
found at nurseries as small plants and should immediately be reattached to 
large plaques made of several 1-by-12-inch boards, held together with 
1-by-1-inch pieces nailed to the back. Tie these ferns on with plastic tree 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
In time they will outgrow even the largest boards and will begin to cling to 
the walls of the house or to a fence, though they are easy to peel off if need 
be. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, near the coast they require next to no maintenance and only 
occasional watering. Though they look decidedly tropical, they are actually 
quite drought-resistant where humidity is reasonably high (as far inland as 
Pasadena) and when they are grown in the shade. 
</P>
<P>
In sun or part shade, try any of the various epiphytic orchids that will grow 
out-of-doors in Southern California. One of the most spectacular, and 
certainly, one of the toughest is the genus Oncidium. These epiphytic orchids 
need no care to speak of but bloom every summer or fall, with huge sprays of 
delicate yellow flowers, marked with splotches of maroon. 
</P>
<P>
Marilynn Cohen, of Marilynn's Garden (by appointment only: 8184 Katella Ave., 
Stanton, (714) 995-4133), thinks that the oncidiums should be on every 
drought-tolerant list of plants because they need so little water, only an 
occasional blast from the hose. She is one source for these exotic plants, 
though they too can be found at some nurseries in summer. They begin flowering 
this month, and the blooms last for weeks.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week: 
</P>
<P>
* For late-summer show of color -- plant petunias, marigolds, zinnias and 
lobelia. 
</P>
<P>
* Check the lawn and garden for pest and diseases. Apply the proper controls 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
* It's a good idea to take down your hanging baskets every now and then and 
give them a thorough soaking by either dunking them in a bucket or by running 
the water from a hose very slowly over a period of time. 
</P>
<P>
* Faded annuals can be quickly replaced with fresh new plants from your 
nursery.

VETS' GARDEN SUPPLIES EATERIES; 
</P>
<P>
VEGETABLES: STARTED BY THE VA AS WORK THERAPY FOR VIETNAM VETERANS, THE 15-ACRE 
FARM PRODUCES INFORMATION AS WELL AS CROPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The produce you get in your arugula-with-goat-cheese salad at the trendiest 
restaurants always seems so much fresher than anything you can find in a 
supermarket. Where do the chefs get this stuff? 
</P>
<P>
Many of the chic eateries -- including City Restaurant and the Border Grill -- 
find just what they need at the Veterans' Garden, a 15-acre organic farm two 
minutes from the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and the San Diego Freeway 
in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
You can visit Mondays from noon to 1 p.m.; fresh produce in season and bedding 
plants are for sale -- at prices substantially below retail, in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
For more of a treat, call first and ask for a tour. The farm is a delight for 
urban gardeners who long for the feel of furrowed fields underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
The Veterans Administration started the farm in 1966 to provide work therapy 
for veterans returning from Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The program's coordinator, Ida Cousino, was there at the very beginning. "We 
had nothing but weeds," she says. Nothing but weeds and a couple of dozen 
developmentally disabled veterans, all eager for work and a return to normal 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Cousino is emphatic: The project is run as a farm, the farm isn't run as a 
project. If its produce doesn't meet the standards required of every other 
specialty farm, the food won't get purchased. But the Vets' Garden makes enough 
money that, unlike many government programs, it doesn't take a big subsidy to 
keep it running. 
</P>
<P>
"The Veterans Administration has paid only our salaries for the last two 
years," Cousino says. "We've earned enough for everything else." 
</P>
<P>
Even the most casual of herb and vegetable gardeners can learn a great deal 
from a visit to the cheerful, immaculate farm. One of the first things you'll 
notice is the widespread use of raised beds, which make it easier to work the 
soil and to control weeds. 
</P>
<P>
Frames for the raised beds are simple to build: just construct a bottomless box 
of 1-by-6 boards in whatever size your yard can accommodate. Don't get fancy -- 
no mitered corners are necessary, and no shop teacher is going to grade your 
work. Hammer the boards together on their edges to form a rectangle. You can 
screw braces on the corners for strength if you're feeling particularly 
energetic. 
</P>
<P>
Some gardeners set their boxes on a thin layer of gravel to help improve 
drainage; others just put them right down on the yard. Pick the hottest, 
sunniest spot you can find -- most vegetables and herbs do their best with 
plenty of light and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
Fill the beds with compost and you're ready to plant. 
</P>
<P>
You can buy excellent compost at any nursery, or you can make your own. Having 
a steady supply handy for use around the yard is a real luxury for any gardener 
-- every time you replant a bed or repot a fern you'll be glad you have it. 
</P>
<P>
The Veterans' Garden has its own special recipe for compost. 
</P>
<P>
"We use only horse manure, because its salt content is just 3% and it degrades 
in four weeks," says foreman Roger Humes. Use one part manure to five parts of 
shredded leaves and grass and turn the compost pile every five days. Spray the 
pile with water occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
You don't need a fancy composter from high-priced catalogues. You can build a 
basic frame of 2-by-4s and staple chicken wire around the outside. Leave a flap 
open at the bottom on one side so you can shovel out the finished compost. 
</P>
<P>
And here's a good trick -- put your compost pile behind a trellis planted with 
Hall's honeysuckle (which is very drought resistant once established) or 
jasmine. Compost doesn't smell nearly as bad as many people think, but you can 
completely disguise any odors with a fragrant plant. 
</P>
<P>
The farm starts most of its plants from seeds, grown in table-top trays in a 
tidy lath house that allows for filtered sun while the plants are small. For 
the home gardener, it is probably easier to buy seedlings at a nursery -- or 
during your visit to the Veterans' Garden. Buy small. Plants tend to acclimate 
better if they're put in when tiny; although they do take somewhat longer to 
get started. 
</P>
<P>
For many people in Southern California, one of the most daunting aspects of 
trying to garden organically are pests. If the white flies don't get your 
veggies, the aphids will. Try spraying your plants gently with the hose to wash 
aphids away; also, just pick off the bugs with your hands. 
</P>
<P>
Or take a tip from the Vets' Garden, where you'll see strips hanging around the 
greenhouse that are virtually covered with dead white flies. You can order 
these nontoxic strips from Sea Bright Labs of Emoryville for $24.50 for a box 
of 100 (there are volume discounts, and the company takes credit cards). The 
strips are "Kodak yellow," to which the flies are apparently drawn. The company 
has a free catalogue of other products for gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
More tips from the Veterans' Garden: 
</P>
<P>
* You may be surprised at how long many vegetables and herbs can go without 
water. It's a mistake to water frequently and lightly; much better to water 
irregularly and quite deeply. The Vets' Garden waters its tomatoes only twice a 
week but totally floods the basins around the plants when it does. 
</P>
<P>
* Purslane, a staple herb in French cooking, is allowed to grow as a ground 
cover around the tomatoes; it helps prevent evaporation. You should also be 
mulching heavily -- up to five or six inches deep if you're using material as 
permeable as straw. 
</P>
<P>
* A fertilizer called Gro-Power, which is 95% organic and 5% nitrogen, may be 
used on an organic garden. The Vets' Garden swear by it. 
</P>
<P>
* Having trouble with ground squirrels eating your plants but hate to hurt the 
animals? You can catch the destructive critters with a "Have a Heart" trap for 
squirrels and release them in the country. You can find these traps in some 
well-equipped nurseries or in organic gardening catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
The garden is located at 11301 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles. Make reservations 
for a tour by calling (213) 824-6771.

THE SMALL INVESTOR: DON'T CARRY NON-PAYING TENANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I own a small neighborhood shopping center. One of my tenants, a 
coffee shop, got behind about six months in rent. When I started eviction, the 
owner filed bankruptcy on me. 
</P>
<P>
After delay after delay the tenant finally moved out and left owing me 11 
months of rent, and I probably won't get a dollar from the bankruptcy court. I 
just thought your readers who own rental property should know it doesn't pay to 
be nice to tenants because they will take advantage of you like mine did. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: I also have learned the hard way that it doesn't pay to be nice to 
tenants who can't pay their rent. The most I let a tenant get behind in rent is 
30 days, but usually I begin eviction within 15 days after the rent was due. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Buy Property on Gross Multiplier Basis 
</P>
<P>
Q: I haven't bought an apartment building in at least five years. But last week 
a real estate agent who sold me a building years ago phoned to tell me about a 
new listing next door to my apartment building. She said the property is for 
sale at 8.5 times gross income. Is that a good deal? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't know. Forget you ever heard those dirty words gross multiplier. The 
building is priced at 8.5 times its gross rental income. But the flaw is the 
gross multiplier doesn't consider the property expenses. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, two identical buildings with identical rental income could be 
priced at 8.5 times the gross rent. However, if one has individual utility 
meters, but the landlord pays the utilities at the other building, the one 
where the tenants pay the utilities is obviously the better buy. 
</P>
<P>
Never use the gross multiplier. Instead, buy income property based on its net 
income. Use the "cap rate" method which capitalizes a building's net income. 
The local cap rate is determined by recent sales prices of similar nearby 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free Management Not Worth Eventual Cost 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own several large apartment buildings. Last week I received a letter from 
a property management company offering to manage my property for free. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said the management company does not charge to collect rents, but 
does charge a leasing fee when an apartment becomes vacant. Also, the 
management company wants the listing if I decide to sell the property. What do 
you think of an arrangement like this? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not much. I'm sure you will get your money's worth from the so-called free 
property management. It is very obvious the management company will earn its 
profits from the leasing fees and from the sales commission if you decide to 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
To check out this firm, ask for names of three of its current clients and phone 
those people to ask if they are satisfied with the company and if they have any 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delayed Exchange Ideal for This Swap 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own about a dozen small residential properties, mostly four units each. 
They are a pain to manage. But I have more than $1 million equity in them. It 
occurred to me I should combine them into one large property which can have a 
resident manager. Can I do this in a tax-deferred exchange? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. You can make tax-deferred exchanges of your properties for one large 
one. This is an ideal situation for a Starker delayed exchange, authorized by 
IRC 1031(a)(3), since it is unlikely that you can make a direct trade for a 
large building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Make Offer Unless Serious Buyer 
</P>
<P>
Q: There is a vacant old house near where I live. It is on a large corner lot, 
which is suitable for a convenience grocery store. I made an offer to buy this 
property and the seller accepted. 
</P>
<P>
But I only put up a $1,000 earnest money deposit with a 180-day closing period. 
Do you think I can get out of this deal, since it doesn't look so good after I 
investigated the costs and problems closely? 
</P>
<P>
A: Shame on you for making a purchase offer to buy a property you really didn't 
want to buy. A better approach would have been to obtain a purchase option. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if you don't complete the purchase, the seller might sue you for damages, 
since his property was tied up for six months and he might have lost another 
profitable opportunity to sell the property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Depreciation Must Be Taken on Property 
</P>
<P>
Q: I had substantial losses in 1989 in my business, so I do not need any tax 
loss from the depreciation of several rental houses I own. How should I show on 
my 1989 income tax returns that I am not deducting any depreciation for 1989? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, but after you acquire depreciable real estate held for use in a trade 
or business you must keep depreciating it. Although the depreciation won't save 
you any income taxes, you must still reduce the basis of your depreciable 
property every year. 
</P>
<P>
However, you can carry over unused tax losses from your investment properties. 
Many investors have built up substantial losses, which can either be used in 
future tax years or you can use them to offset realty sales profits. Please 
consult your tax adviser for full details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fixer-Uppers in City Offer Profit Potential 
</P>
<P>
Q: I believe real estate offers the best long-term investment in growing 
cities. But I am receiving conflicting advice as to whether to invest in older 
property, such as a rental house, or a brand-new building that probably won't 
need much repairs. What do you advise? 
</P>
<P>
A: Although you will usually have fewer headaches with new buildings, there 
often isn't much profit potential in such property. I recommend older 
structures which can be profitably upgraded to increase their market value by 
more than the cost of the improvements. 
</P>
<P>

Depreciation Allowed on Straight-Line Basis 
</P>
<P>
Q: Years ago I used to invest in apartment buildings, but I sold them. Now I am 
thinking of buying investment property again. I recall something about Congress 
changing the rules on depreciation. Please clarify the choices as to how many 
years I can use for depreciation? 
</P>
<P>
A: You don't have any choice. Current law says you must depreciate residential 
rental property over at least 27.5 years and commercial property over at least 
31.5 years. Only straight-line depreciation is available. No more accelerated 
depreciation. Please consult your tax adviser for more details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Get Tax Advice Before Abandoning Property 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a partner in a group that owns an apartment building in Texas. It is 
now worth less than the mortgage balance. Some of the partners think we should 
stop making mortgage payments and let the lender foreclose, since we have 
virtually no chance of selling it for what we owe. It is losing money and we 
can't afford the property taxes. Do you think we should abandon the building? 
</P>
<P>
A: Before you decide, please consult your tax adviser. In the situation you 
describe where you will be receiving mortgage relief, if your depreciated book 
value for the property is below the mortgage balance, the IRS says you will owe 
profit tax on the difference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lease-Option Buyer Gains Tax Advantage 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am acquiring an apartment building on a 30-year lease with an option to 
purchase. The reason for not acquiring the title is to avoid having the 
mortgage lender enforce the due on sale clause on the 7.5% interest rate 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
I will make my payment to the seller who will then pay the mortgage lender. 
However, the seller says he is entitled to keep the depreciation deduction, 
since he will still hold the legal title. But my CPA says I should get the 
depreciation writeoff, since I am the "equitable owner" even though I am not 
yet the "legal owner." Who is right? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your CPA is correct. For income tax purposes, the IRS recognizes a lease of 
30 years or longer, coupled with an option to purchase, as the equivalent of a 
sale. Since the IRS recognizes this as a sale, you are entitled to the 
depreciation tax deduction. 
</P>
<P>
This is much like a land contract or contract for deed where the seller retains 
the title, but the buyer is the equitable owner entitled to all the income tax 
ownership benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, the way lenders learn about a title transfer is from the new fire 
insurance policy. You may wish to keep the old fire insurance policy in the 
seller's name, but with you added as an additional loss payee.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT A LACK OF CREATIVITY; 
</P>
<P>
DECORATING: PROFESSOR SAYS MOST PEOPLE CAN BE CREATIVE AND SHOULD NOT DEPEND 
TOTALLY ON ADVICE OF INTERIOR DECORATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you're ready to redecorate, don't put yourself at the total mercy of an 
interior designer -- even if you think you don't have a creative bone in your 
body. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't say 'I am not creative, so I can't decorate my own home.' Say 'I'm not 
sure, but I will try,' " says Prof. Morris Stein, a psychologist at New York 
University who specializes in human creativity. 
</P>
<P>
Stein says there is no proof that creativity is an innate quality or a learned 
skill, but it is known that motivation is a powerful stimulus. Therefore, get 
moving; act as if creativity can be increased. It might awaken what is there or 
add to your store. 
</P>
<P>
Stein says you can get your creative juices flowing by starting with a 
metaphor. Inventors often use metaphors in their quest for something new. The 
metaphor of the human inner ear ultimately led Alexander Graham Bell to the 
telephone. The Wright Brothers studied buzzards before coming up with the 
airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Some metaphors liken the home to a castle, palace, museum, cave or shell. A 
room suggested by the opulence of a castle is going to be quite different from 
that suggested by a cave, a dark refuge. 
</P>
<P>
The metaphor of a cave might be translated into a bedroom with low light 
levels, enveloping window coverings and a bed draped in fabric and piled with 
pillows. 
</P>
<P>
People who spend most of their time and energy away from home might prefer 
impersonal surroundings such as those found in a first-class hotel -- 
comfortable yet easy to care for. 
</P>
<P>
For some, home is a place where worldly success can be reflected with 
possessions on display, rich fabrics and plenty of room for entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
Stein made use of a metaphor when he designed his weekend home. "I grew up in a 
tradition in which the kitchen is warmth and family," he says, "so I can feed 
20 people in my kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
He says the kitchen is the social center of his home. When friends come for 
dinner, they pitch in and help with the cooking because the kitchen encourages 
working together while socializing. 
</P>
<P>
Creativity is enhanced by knowledge, so in addition to metaphoric thinking, 
Stein advises exploring the marketplace. "Let your looking stimulate you to 
write down ideas," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Another way to stimulate the imagination, he says, is to change a noun into a 
verb. "Don't think about the bedroom -- a static concept. Instead, think of 
bedrooming, kitchening, dining and instead of a shower, think of the meaning of 
showering." 
</P>
<P>
For example, if the meaning of showering is rejuvenating, you will naturally be 
led to think of whether controls are in the right place and if there should 
there be more than one shower head. 
</P>
<P>
Not only should spaces and furnishings support your specific activities, you 
should also try to involve all the senses in your design. Too often, we 
emphasize the visual and auditory senses and minimize touch and smell. Very few 
people pay attention to the kinesthetic sense, which is the body sense that 
operates when you sit in a chair and it feels good, says Stein. 
</P>
<P>
Stein's views on creativity are shared by Ted Pappas, a decorator from 
Westport, Conn., who has been teaching decorating skills for about 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has an innate sense of style and design about what they like," Pappas 
says. "Some have to work a little harder and others are more adept, but anyone 
can learn how to decorate a home better." 
</P>
<P>
As an instructor in adult education courses in interior decorating at the New 
Canaan YMCA, Pappas covers how to lay out a floor plan, window treatments, 
furniture styles, how to combine furniture and accessories from more than one 
period and how to shop. 
</P>
<P>
To help students understand what he calls their well-formed but unarticulated 
personal tastes, he has them create a picture book of colors, room arrangements 
and furnishings they like. 
</P>
<P>
"You would be amazed at how different each individual is," he says. "Two people 
may say they like the same style, but their scrapbooks will be very different."

REMODELER'S DIARY: UPDATING TOWNHOMES BRINGS OUT NEIGHBORLINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIMBERLY WELLS, Wells is a West Hollywood townhouse owner. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most homeowners find their biggest surprises come from the cost and the time 
needed to complete their remodeling projects. Not me. 
</P>
<P>
While I'll admit to being taken aback by a bid or two, in truth, my biggest 
surprises have come from the unexpected benefits of remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
When the city of West Hollywood passed rent-control laws in 1986, a surplus of 
condo conversions enabled me and 14 other lucky buyers to purchase charming 
two-story townhouses with wooden floors, French windows and unexpected 
archways. 
</P>
<P>
On the downside, my charming townhouse also came equipped with 60-year-old 
plumbing and wiring, ugly carpeting and a kitchen and bathroom that had been 
badly remodeled 30 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Even at the rock-bottom prices we paid for our new homes, our budgets were low 
and our remodeling needs high. 
</P>
<P>
But because 15 people had bought almost exactly the same home at almost exactly 
the same price, we quickly learned about the benefits of semi-communal living. 
</P>
<P>
By sharing resources such as my floor refinisher, Mark's plumber and Paul's 
handyman, we were able to develop an extensive network of workers who could do 
the best work for reasonable sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
And because the plumber, handyman, floor refinisher had worked the unit next 
door or across the courtyard, they could anticipate problems before they ever 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
When the electrical remodeling proved to be an enormous undertaking, our entire 
complex banded together to get one bid to complete the whole building. We 
decided as a group on the minimum amount of work to be completed in each unit, 
to ensure that our new homes were both up to code and safe from such natural 
disasters as earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Then each homeowner decided for himself or herself about additional work to be 
done in each unit -- such as the location of new outlets, installation of new 
circuits for computers or garbage disposals, even basic wiring in areas that 
will some day be used for expansion. 
</P>
<P>
A tireless and efficient homeowners' association board found the electrical 
contractors to complete the task at the promised price and on a reasonable 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
I have also learned to be grateful for my creative neighbors, since their ideas 
could often be incorporated into my home. Until Wendy started ripping up the 
seven layers of linoleum on her kitchen floor, I would never have considered 
the possibility that the original flooring could be oak -- oak that refinished 
magnificently. 
</P>
<P>
It was Leslie and Lynn who discovered that the attic could one day be an extra 
bedroom, but in the meantime, could serve as a efficient storage space by 
installing some basic flooring. And Paul's folding shutters served equally well 
in my house to hide the water heater until the kitchen remodeling is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Need a second bathroom? Well, one neighbor turned the master bedroom's walk-in 
closet into a charming powder room, while another took advantage of an 
odd-shaped nook in the living room. On the other hand, my next door neighbors 
turned that same nook into an efficient and convenient laundry center, hidden 
behind a newly installed folding door. 
</P>
<P>
Remodeling a kitchen? From the most basic to the most lavish, someone in our 
complex has completed the project, so I have had the luxury of learning from 
other people's time and money. 
</P>
<P>
When I meet with designers, I can march them from kitchen to kitchen and point 
to specific details that I find desirable. And when the bids come back, I know 
when they' re too high, and when they're within the range of acceptability. 
</P>
<P>
All this pooled information and shared resources has brought me closer to my 
neighbors and created a sense of community that is too often missing in a big 
city. 
</P>
<P>
There's a warmth and intimacy that couldn't exist without our shared commitment 
to revitalizing and renovating our small complex. And in a few instances, my 
neighbors have truly become my friends, adding joy and comfort to my life. 
</P>
<P>
Like every other homeowner, I have learned some unexpected skills as a result 
of my renovations. I can tile, replace a faucet and even do some basic wiring. 
I have also learned that I can paint a house -- but will never do it again. 
</P>
<P>
By throwing myself into projects with advice and occasional hands-on help from 
friends, neighbors and family, I have learned that I have abilities I never had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
When I walk across a bathroom floor that I retiled, it's a constant inspiration 
to experiment, to reach beyond my limitations. Just because I haven't done 
something doesn't mean I can't. 
</P>
<P>
And when I find out that I either can't -- or won't ever do it again, that's 
when I call in the experts. And that's another unexpected benefit of 
remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
For every single woman in Los Angeles who has ever complained about meeting 
men, I have the solution. Don't hire a matchmaker, hire a contractor. 
Innumerable bright, energetic, charming men -- some of them single -- have 
crossed my doorstep in the last couple of years, men who not only have a 
profession -- but an exceptionally well-paying profession for which there seems 
to be an endless demand. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing contractors and designers about remodeling my kitchen, a man 
who had designed and constructed cabinets for friends came over to give me a 
bid. I'm still considering the bid, but I accepted an invitation to dinner and 
we've been dating ever since. He's been a most unexpected benefit of 
remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
Between my remodeling efforts and escalating real estate prices in Los Angeles, 
my charming townhouse is now worth roughly three times what I paid for it. I've 
broadened my skills, added to my circle of friends and found a warm and 
wonderful new relationship all by remodeling. Oh, and by the way, my house 
looks a lot better then when I started.

CHILD DROWNINGS SPUR CRUSADES FOR SAFE POOLS;

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly nine months after the accident, Jim Landis is still haunted by the image 
of his 18-month-old son, a chubby, blond-haired boy, clad in blue coveralls, 
floating face down in the family pool. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey had been playing beside his father last December when Landis left his 
son alone briefly to get a broom from the garage. He returned perhaps 45 
seconds later to find Jeffrey unconscious in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
But Landis was lucky. A passing patrolman administered cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation, getting the child breathing again within minutes. Hospitalized 
briefly, Jeffrey suffered neither brain damage nor pneumonia, and today is an 
active 2-year-old with no memory of his brush with death. 
</P>
<P>
But Landis remembers. And determined that no other parent should go through the 
anguish of a near-drowning or drowning, the 39-year-old commercial real estate 
broker has become a crusader for pool safety. 
</P>
<P>
Since April, he has been meeting with county supervisors and officials in 
Newport Beach, Laguna Niguel and Irvine, trying to persuade them that a tough 
new ordinance -- requiring a safety cover or a 5-foot barrier around every pool 
-- is needed to protect small children. 
</P>
<P>
Working with Children's Hospital of Orange County and his newly formed 
Children's Pool Safety Organization, Landis is also developing a poster and 
video campaign to educate parents on CPR and pool safety techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Landis' effort is the latest in a wave of hotly debated, anti-drowning 
campaigns that have often pitted pool builders against parents, pediatricians 
and other safety advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Similar drives led to a variety of pool safety ordinances in Northern 
California's Contra Costa County in 1984, in Dallas in 1988, and this year in 
Arlington, Tex., and Montgomery County, Md., as well as Tucson, Phoenix and the 
entire state of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Pool builders argue that requirements for fences or pool covers will price 
potential buyers out of the market. But safety experts note a growing awareness 
by builders and parents alike that the alluring back-yard pool can be a 
deathtrap. 
</P>
<P>
In Arizona, California, Florida and Texas, drowning is the leading cause of 
death for children under the age of 5, according to the U.S. Consumer Product 
Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Also, commission officials say, each year about 350 children under age 5 drown 
in back-yard pools and another 4,200 receive emergency room treatment for 
"submersion." While some "near-drowners" recover completely, others incur 
severe brain damage and are hospitalized for life. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, 11 children under age 5 typically drown each year and another 
90 are hospitalized in near-drownings, county epidemiologist Hildy Meyers said. 
In Los Angeles County last year, more than 23 children under age 5 drowned and 
an estimated 240 nearly drowned. And in San Diego, five children under age 5 
drowned in pools or spas and another 50 went to San Diego's Children's Hospital 
after near-drownings. 
</P>
<P>
Although the drowning statistics have not varied greatly for years, safety 
experts still call them shocking. 
</P>
<P>
"If a tiger got loose and ate eight kids -- it's the same thing," said J. 
Randall Ogden, a Tucson paramedic who led the fight for his city's new fencing 
ordinance. "It (a pool) is like a tiger in your back yard." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Baxter, western regional director for the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
Commission, called drownings for children under 5 comparable to deaths from 
polio for that age group in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"You know we aren't going to have a Salk vaccine for swimming pool deaths," 
Baxter said. "But we can do other steps that are pragmatic. Fences have a role. 
So do swimming pool covers and alarms" that signal when a door to the pool has 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
Around the nation, cities have long required fences around a pool -- typically 
a three-sided fence along the property line, with the house on the fourth side. 
The idea was to "keep a trespassing child out of the pool," Baxter said. "No 
real thought was given to the child that lives there." 
</P>
<P>
But a 1986 Consumer Product Safety Commission study showed the child most at 
risk for drowning was the child with a pool at his home. In its study of 
"submersion" incidents, 98% of the children lived with the pool; only 2% were 
trespassers. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has proposed a model code that would make it hard for children 
to approach their back-yard pools unobserved. In addition to a 4-foot-high 
fence on at least three sides of the pool -- the other side being the house -- 
the code requires alarms on doors to the house if they open to the water. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is near agreement with a national pool group as well as the 
nation's building code officials on the ordinance. If approved -- probably in 
September -- Baxter said his agency will ask cities to apply the code not only 
to new pools but to the nation's 6 million existing pools. 
</P>
<P>
William Sadd, director of the National Spa and Pool Institute, representing 
pool industry officials, said the proposed requirements were not prohibitively 
expensive. An automatic cover may add $5,000 to the cost of a typical $20,000, 
15-by-30-foot California pool, he said; a fence probably less than that. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody agrees that adult supervision is the key factor in preventing child 
drownings," Sadd said. "And in every case of child drowning, there's been a 
failure of adult supervision. So . . . you have to establish other lines of 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
But Sadd's views were denounced by several western pool builders. Charlie 
Rumpf, owner of Anaheim's Monarch Pools, said many Orange County lots were too 
narrow for both a pool and surrounding fence. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Rumpf argued: "Why should you have a fence if you don't have kids? And 
if you have kids -- look at the statistics: 38% of the drownings happen inside 
the fence . . . Our feeling is there's nothing that can replace the parents 
watching the kids. We feel that's a better approach than going out here with a 
shotgun and passing a lot of bills that will hurt our industry." 
</P>
<P>
Also, fences don't work, said California pool lobbyist Donald C. Burns, because 
"invariably they're wired open in the summer swimming season." 
</P>
<P>
Burns, executive vice president of the California Spa and Pool Council, 
representing 600 pool retailers and manufacturers, also argued that new fencing 
creates "a false sense of security" and does not substitute for supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Still, recent studies make a case for fencing. A July 6 federal report on child 
drownings in Maricopa County, Ariz., suggested that "pool fencing in 
combination with adequate gates and latches could have prevented 70 (51%) of 
the 137 drownings or near drownings." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a 1988 Australian study predicted that 73% of all back-yard 
drownings in the Perth metropolitan area "could have been avoided had isolation 
fencing (fencing around a pool) been in place." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders in several communities with fencing ordinances said they 
believed new regulations had helped to reduce drownings. 
</P>
<P>
In Contra Costa County, where the nation's first ordinance requires a fence, a 
pool cover, or alarms on doors to the pool, drownings dropped from 12 in 1983 
to three in 1984, the year it took effect, said Larry Cohen, the county health 
department's director of prevention programs. Local officials are also pleased 
that the law's $25 fee for new pools raised $12,000 for safety education last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
And time and again, they credited one woman's campaign for their law. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1978, housewife Nadina Rigsby left her 2-year-old daughter Samira and 
14-month-old son Jerry with a baby-sitter. She returned home to find her 
daughter dead and her son in a coma after both children fell into the pool. The 
sitter had left them alone, supposedly watching television, for 15 minutes, 
Rigsby said. But Samira apparently unlatched the door to the pool, and the baby 
followed his sister outside to the water. 
</P>
<P>
In months of tending "J.J." at Oakland Children's Hospital, Rigsby said, she 
"started seeing babies coming in every week" -- victims of near-drownings. And 
in 1980, after her severely brain-damaged son finally came home, she began her 
drive for a pool ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Four years after passage of the ordinance, Rigsby is still energetically 
campaigning against drowning. As founder of an educational group, the Drowning 
Prevention Foundation, Rigsby said: "My goal is to protect children from 
themselves. They can't read the English that says don't go near the pool." 
</P>
<P>
For all that, Rigsby would like to amend her law, killing the provision about 
pool alarms. "People are putting in little Mickey Mouse alarms to satisfy the 
building department and then disconnecting them," she complained. And musing 
aloud, Rigsby suggested that perhaps there were really no safe pools. "The only 
answer," she said, "is no water." 
</P>
<P>
In Tucson, where a pool ordinance took effect in January, anti-drowning 
activists suggest that publicity from the campaign may have reduced drownings 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Tucson had 12 drownings and 39 near-drownings last year but "this year we've 
had one death so far and only 16 near-drownings. So we're way down," said 
Ogden, the paramedic who is program coordinator of the Tucson Drowning 
Prevention Committee. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its campaign, the committee has circulated a pool safety curriculum 
for preschoolers and sponsored radio spots and posters featuring a grieving 
paramedic beside a pool. The message: "What do you say to a parent who leaves a 
child alone by a pool? I'm sorry. . . . We did all we could." 
</P>
<P>
But unhappy with the new law -- and with what he calls "scare tactics" by Ogden 
-- is Mark A. Ragel, general manager of Southern Arizona's largest pool 
company, Patio Pools. 
</P>
<P>
Ragel called a mandatory fencing law unfair and said he was now fighting city 
bureaucrats after an elderly customer with a $10,000 pool installed a $600 
fence -- but still failed to meet the code. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're discriminating against (with the new ordinance) is the elderly and 
retired people that don't have kids in the home," Ragel railed. 
</P>
<P>
But Ogden, who has been present at every drowning or near-drowning scene in the 
city since 1982, has little sympathy for pool owners who complain about the 
cost of a fence. 
</P>
<P>
If someone budgets $10,000 for a pool and can't afford the $1,500 fence, 
"that's OK," Ogden said. "My feeling is that $1,500 is the cost of an emergency 
room visit" after a near-drowning, he said, adding that it costs tens of 
thousands a year to take care of a child with neurological dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Landis has been studying posters from Tucson and getting 
advice from Rigsby as part of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
So far, local officials are interested. "From the data we have, it looks like 
(a fencing ordinance) would aid in preventing childhood drowning," said county 
epidemiologist Meyers. But if an ordinance applied only to new pools -- and not 
the county's 100,000 existing pools -- it would be many years before its impact 
was visible, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach building director Ray W. Schuller said he would wait to see if 
the International Conference of Building Officials adopted a model pool code at 
its September meeting in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great idea. It saves lives, so obviously it's something we should think 
about," Schuller said. "The other side of the coin is, people ordinarily think 
of their home as their castle, and they don't want us to mess with it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Landis has been following nearly weekly reports of children drowned 
or nearly drowned in back-yard pools. In the last few weeks, a 22-month-old 
Newport Beach boy died when he fell into his parents' spa. And a 6-year-old boy 
died three days after he was pulled unconscious from the bottom of a Costa Mesa 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Each story is "upsetting," Landis said. "You just feel so sorry for the people. 
. . . It just makes me want to hurry up and get something done."

AFTER REPORTS OF ABUSES, STATE CLOSES DRUG PROGRAM 
</P>

YORBA LINDA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State social service officials, citing allegations of physical and mental 
abuse, have denied an operating license to Straight Inc., a nationally known 
adolescent drug treatment program that has come under fire for its 
confrontational methods. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida-based organization, one of the largest live-in drug programs for 
youth in the nation, had opened its first California treatment center a year 
ago in Yorba Linda and had applied for a license as a foster-family agency. The 
license had been pending since its opening in July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But in a letter sent to Straight's St. Petersburg headquarters in June, 
California officials ordered the facility closed, citing evidence of "unusual 
punishment, infliction of pain and humiliation, mental abuse and withholding 
(of) medication," and other violations. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as July 19, the Yorba Linda program was served with notice that it 
was violating state law because it had continued to operate the facility, a 
misdemeanor that carries a fine of $200 per day and possible criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
However, Straight officials said this week that the program has been shut down 
since the July 19 notice and that they are complying with Department of Social 
Service orders. Straight officials also strongly denied allegations of abuse 
and said they are mystified by the state's action and will appeal the license 
denial. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not seen any of the documentation they are referring to, so we have no 
idea what they mean," said Joy Margolis, Straight's vice president for 
communications. "In the letter that was sent to us, they are in error in a lot 
of things they said. We have been meeting and working with the department since 
July of 1989 to make sure that we complied with state laws, and as far as we 
knew everything was going fine." 
</P>
<P>
Margolis said 68 people, most of them minors, were enrolled in the Straight 
program at Yorba Linda when it closed. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Norris, spokeswoman for the Department of Social Services, said the 
state's action was based on an extensive investigation and complaints about 
Straight's tactics. She would not detail the investigation, citing concerns 
about confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
Straight officials have not been told details of the alleged abusive incidents, 
Norris acknowledged, "but that type of thing will be included in the grounds 
for denial, and they will have a chance to be fully heard and respond in front 
of an administrative law judge." 
</P>
<P>
While Straight has garnered praise for its program from President Bush and 
Nancy Reagan, among others, it has run afoul of licensing officials in several 
states on allegations of abuse. Investigators in Virginia and Massachusetts are 
checking allegations of abuse at Straight's Springfield and Boston centers; the 
Dallas-area program is being monitored; the group was on probation in Florida 
last year, and it has been sued in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Margolis said the Yorba Linda treatment program was opened at the request of 
parents whose children had been left untended when another rehabilitation 
program, KIDS of Southern California, went out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Both programs, run out of the same Yorba Linda warehouse, used similar 
confrontational techniques, according to former patients and Social Services 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of Straight's treatment program are daily rap sessions, at which 
patients are required to sit straight up in plastic chairs for up to 10 hours. 
They must confess their drug abuse at the sessions; if uncooperative, they are 
verbally attacked. 
</P>
<P>
At night, the youngsters are taken to "host homes" -- usually parents of 
patients who have agreed to house them for up to a year and who are also 
expected to equip bedroom windows and doors with alarms and other security 
devices to prevent escape. 
</P>
<P>
Straight officials say such "positive peer pressure" has had greater success in 
treating patients than conventional rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
California authorities allege that Straight has failed to comply with several 
state regulations and has violated Health and Safety Code requirements. 
</P>
<P>
According to a June 27 letter to Straight signed by the Santa Ana district 
manager for the Department of Social Services, Fred Dumont: "Documentation on 
file indicates that there have been incidents where children have been 
subjected unusual punishment, infliction of pain, humiliation, intimidation, 
ridicule, coercion, threat, mental abuse or other actions of a punitive nature, 
including . . . interference with daily living functions such as eating, 
sleeping or toileting, or withholding of medication." 
</P>
<P>
The state also alleges that "certification of host homes, placement of children 
and social work practices" fail to follow standards established by the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Public records on file at the Santa Ana office contain several complaints from 
former Straight patients and a physician at a San Bernardino County hospital 
who treated a 17-year-old female patient. The doctor's name was blacked out on 
his complaint by state officials. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint, filed July 19, the girl was taken to Straight for a 
substance abuse problem, but the doctor said it was "questionable" whether she 
actually had one. She was accompanied by her father and a female "guard," who 
was later identified as a Straight staff member, according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"She related to me that she was being 'held against her will' at Straight . . . 
that there was 'a code of silence' where people at Straight were unable to talk 
with either their families or with anyone on the outside about what transpired 
in the program," the doctor wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"She reported to me," the doctor said, "that if she did not sit up straight she 
would be restrained forcibly and rather violently on the floor with her face 
down. The staff would then pin her arms and legs up behind her back." 
</P>
<P>
The doctor also expressed concern that, according to the girl, no counseling 
was taking place and she was not allowed to go to school, read or communicate 
with her family while in the program. "I was gravely concerned for her 
well-being upon her return to that facility," the physician wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In another complaint, dated July 23, a former patient relates being "restrained 
by my mouth being covered and my arms held down, not being able to breathe. I 
advised Straight that I was in pain several times but was denied medical 
treatment for 2 1/2 weeks. . . . I was denied bathroom privileges for up to two 
to three hours. I was afraid to say or do anything wrong for fear of being 
restrained, yelled at or having my mouth covered." 
</P>
<P>
Margolis said she is not aware of the incidents and knows of no complaints 
"lodged against the California program." 
</P>
<P>
"To our knowledge the (state) has not investigated the situation by going to 
Straight and asking us about it. There are two sides to every story. How much 
of this is accurate?" 
</P>
<P>
As to restraint procedures, she said: "Clients are not allowed to restrain 
other clients, only staff members and only when it becomes necessary; for 
example, when a client is physically violent. 
</P>
<P>
"Our treatment is based on structure, there are safeguards. If they are minors, 
we don't want them to run away and literally play on the streets when the 
families have placed them in treatment. They are watched carefully, because 
they are druggies and they are sometimes volatile." 
</P>
<P>
Straight attorney Carol D. Scott Los Angeles said the group will cooperate with 
state officials, but she complained that the state allowed its allegations "to 
be opened up to the public without my clients having a fair opportunity to 
respond. My clients have the best interests of the kids at heart," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have not scheduled a hearing on the closure, but Norris said 
Straight might end up with a license to operate in California: "Typically, if 
they express an interest in conforming to guidelines, the department would be 
willing to work with them."

It was for all of $20 that Kessara Pattanatanung was shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
Four masked robbers entered the Thai restaurant where Pattanatanung worked and 
shot her in the chest Friday before rifling the cash register and fleeing, Long 
Beach Police said. 
</P>
<P>
"They fired several times, demanded money and fired again," Police Detective 
Dennis Robbins said. "It appears shots were deliberately fired at" the waitress 
and cook. 
</P>
<P>
Pattanatanung, 29, was dead by the time police arrived at the Thai Chef 
Restaurant at 1460 Alamitos Ave. at 9:35 p.m. The cook, Yupha Thonginphong, 40, 
was shot in the face. She was treated at St. Mary Medical Center and released. 
</P>
<P>
Two other employees were in the restaurant, but neither was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police issued only a bare description of the robbers as 16 to 18.

FEARS GROW OVER SKEWED ETHNIC MIX IN SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: NEW NORTH COUNTY CLASSROOMS ARE BEING FILLED PREDOMINANTLY WITH 
WHITE STUDENTS WHILE OLDER SCHOOLS NEAR CITY CENTERS ARE OVERLOADED WITH 
MINORITIES.

<P>
As more minority students enroll in existing schools, and because most Tnew 
schools are being built in white areas, North County classrooms are growing 
increasingly segregated, raising fears that "inner-city" schools are developing 
in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
In one Escondido school, 92% of the students are white; in another, only 32% 
are white. Two of Carlsbad's elementary schools have seen the ethnic-minority 
population grow to more than 55%, but a new school in the district will have 
less than 10% minority students. 
</P>
<P>
School officials say the racial makeup of communities changes so quickly and in 
such concentrated ways that they can't change the school boundaries fast enough 
to keep a balance. 
</P>
<P>
But some parents and teachers say that districts have had ample opportunities 
to adjust attendance boundaries to achieve better racial balance, and they 
accuse district administrators of neglecting schools with large Latino 
populations, which tend to be older and sometimes more crowded than other 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
One teacher at San Marcos Elementary charges that not only are Latino students 
being "dumped" into the school -- one of the oldest in San Marcos Unified -- 
but also that their needs are being ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see at least an ethnic balance close to what the other schools 
in the district have," said Rudy Gutierrez, a bilingual education teacher at 
San Marcos Elementary, where minorities make up two-thirds of the student 
population. "I just don't understand why, rather than trying to balance out the 
population, they increased the minority population another 3 or 4%." 
</P>
<P>
But school officials say that San Marcos Elementary's location makes it the 
hardest to balance out. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the place that is most difficult to achieve balance is in schools 
that already exist because, then you're talking about a significant dislocation 
of people," said Mac Bernd, superintendent of San Marcos Unified. 
</P>
<P>
A parent at a recent San Marcos Unified school board meeting expressed fear 
that San Marcos Elementary is developing into an "inner-city school." 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos Unified is typical of school districts across North County that are 
experiencing not only tremendous growth, but also increased proportions of 
minority, especially Latino, students. 
</P>
<P>
"We grew by about 700 to 800 students this year, and probably three quarters of 
that was Hispanic," said Joe DeDiminicantanio, assistant superintendent at San 
Marcos Unified. 
</P>
<P>
What happens there, and in many other North County school districts, is that 
new housing developments are too expensive for most ethnic-minority families, 
who tend to live in the less-expensive downtowns. But the schools are built 
near the outlying tracts because that's where the school districts can get 
developers to give them land. 
</P>
<P>
The result, school officials concede, is 
</P>
<P>
that a disproportionate percentage of minority students are in older schools 
near low-cost housing in the "inner city" of the town, while the new schools 
are populated mostly by whites in outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the San Diego city schools, which use voluntary busing to achieve racial 
balance, North County school districts are not under court order to 
desegregate, so they don't get state funds for busing, officials point out. 
</P>
<P>
The county Office of Education projects that 11 North County school districts 
will be among the 12 fastest-growing districts in the county over the next 10 
years, and many of those districts expect much of that growth to be among 
Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
Many districts have policies that limit how far a school's racial balance can 
stray from the district average. Yet almost every district has at least one 
school that violates the policy, and districts claim they can do little about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The policy at the Oceanside Unified School District, for example, is not to 
have any school fall 15 percentage points above or below the district-wide 
average, which, for elementary schools, is 56% ethnic minority. In other words, 
no school is supposed to draw less than 41% or more than 71% of its students 
from ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the district's 15 elementary schools, however, fall outside those 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
At the Christa McAuliffe School, which opened in 1989, ethnic minorities make 
up 33.6% of the students, while, on the other end of the spectrum, 83.9% of the 
students at Ditmar School are nonwhite. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done everything we can do to maintain that ethnic balance throughout 
the district," said Supt. Steven Speach. "There have been several boundary 
changes in the past four or five years to try and maintain the ethnic balance." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside follows the North County pattern of having its new schools in the 
areas where growth is projected -- and where school sites are available. 
</P>
<P>
In primarily Latino areas, which tend to be in already-developed parts of the 
city, there are few school sites available, Speach said. 
</P>
<P>
"The funding for school construction is very, very limited," Speach said. "We 
have two sources: development fees and the state building program. What we have 
done is, wherever there was a large development, we've gone in and negotiated 
with the developer and said, look, in lieu of fees, we'll take land. 
</P>
<P>
"And, well, you take land wherever you can get it." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, at Carlsbad Unified, Aviara Oaks Elementary School plans to open in 
September on the outskirts of the district's boundaries with a projected 
ethnic-minority enrollment of 5% to 10%, and to push the ethnic-minority 
enrollment of neighboring Pine and Jefferson Elementary schools into the 60% to 
70% range. The district average is 27%. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the houses being built in the attendance area of the new school is 
admittedly prohibitive to a large percentage of the ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"There won't be even anything available in the area (near Aviara Oaks) for 
Latinos to rent, not to mention buy," said Cheryl Ernst, assistant 
superintendent at Carlsbad Unified. 
</P>
<P>
Vista Unified School District's elementary schools have steadily become more 
segregated during the past five years. Santa Fe/California Elementary School in 
the center of town has the heaviest concentration of Latinos, blacks and Asians 
in the district. Its enrollment has steadily climbed from 51.7% ethnic-minority 
in 1986 to 64% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vista Unified's three newest elementary schools, Alamosa Park, Lake 
and Empresa, have the lowest concentrations of ethnic-minority students in the 
district, with 17.9%, 24.6% and 19.6% respectively in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
And the situation in Vista Unified is likely to become more unbalanced. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Riedberger, assistant superintendent of administrative services, said the 
minority population in the district climbs another percentage point or two 
every year. Now it is 36%, and he sees no end in the trend. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hispanic population is moving into the Santa Fe and Bobier Elementary 
School attendance areas," Riedberger said. "But, on the other hand, we know 
that the new schools that we've built in the last four years have taken away 
from schools like Bobier and Santa Fe some of their Anglo" students. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the newest San Marcos elementary school, Knob Hill Elementary, 
opened in 1988 with an ethnic-minority enrollment of 43%, slightly above the 
district average, and an elementary school scheduled to open in September will 
have a similar racial composition. 
</P>
<P>
"Our approach has been that, at least over the past four or five years, as we 
put new schools on line, we've tried to create attendance boundaries so that 
the student bodies in those new schools are pretty reflective of the average 
mix in our district," said Supt. Bernd. 
</P>
<P>
But San Marcos Elementary School, with 66% minority enrollment, sits in stark 
contrast to Woodland Park and La Costa Meadows Elementary schools, where the 
minority enrollments are 21% and 13%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos Elementary teacher Gutierrez characterized many of her school's 
students as at risk, coming from single-parent and transient homes where 
participation in school matters typically is lower than in more affluent areas. 
And the district, she complained, has done little to help. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Gutierrez said, San Marcos Elementary has had no playground 
equipment for the past school year until recently. 
</P>
<P>
"Why wasn't the problem of playground equipment dealt with immediately? These 
children need their exercise, and it was wrong to leave them without some sort 
of playground," Gutierrez said. "Would this have happened at La Costa Meadows? 
No way. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of school board decisions made for this one school are really inadequate 
because they know that the parents at this school are disenfranchised because 
they don't have any voice," Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the San Marcos Unified school board maintain that the education 
received at all of the schools is equal, but some parents argue that the high 
concentration of minority students makes it inherently unequal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ludicrous for them to say that the schools are equal," said Donna 
Hernandez, a parent of two elementary school students and a member of the San 
Marcos group Citizens for a Better Board. 
</P>
<P>
"The societal problems at each school vary drastically when you have 26% white 
at one school and 87% at another," Hernandez said. "The board just has not been 
responsive when it comes to racial balance." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez understands that integration cannot be achieved overnight, but she 
thinks that the district failed to seize an opportunity in its recent boundary 
adjustments to take steps toward integrating San Marcos Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
Bernd said that, to bring the ethnic-minority enrollment of San Marcos 
Elementary close to the district average, 2,400 students would have to be 
dislocated, three times the number that will already be dislocated in the 
opening of the new school. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just dealing with ethnic balance in adjusting boundaries," Bernd 
said. "We're also dealing with school size, natural boundaries, safety 
considerations, transportation costs, and you have ethnic balance, and we 
looked at all of those factors when we drew the new boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
State laws do not require school districts to apply any hard-and-fast numbers 
to determine whether schools have become segregated, only that they "undertake 
reasonably feasible steps to alleviate" segregation, according to a 1976 state 
Supreme Court decision, said Christina Dyer, general counsel for San Diego City 
Schools. 
</P>
<P>
And, as a practical matter, some school officials said, the cost of English as 
a second language and bilingual programs makes it more cost-efficient for 
financially strapped school districts to group Latino students together, 
according to some school officials. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, it makes things a little bit easier because, if you have a 
higher concentration of minorities, you can concentrate your resources," San 
Marcos assistant superintendent DeDiminicantanio said. 
</P>
<P>
Dyer said she sympathizes with the North County school districts' situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Their growth needs are so tremendous up in North County," Dyer said. "If you 
don't have places for kids coming to school, first you've got to get a roof 
over their heads, then you start looking at, OK, now I've got them in a school, 
what's going on in the school, and then is it integrated?"

Last Days -- This is the final week for the Natural History Museum of Orange 
County at its current site in a closed elementary school in Newport Beach. When 
the doors close to the public on Friday, museum staff and volunteers will start 
packing up for the move to a new interim site in Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"We're shooting for a mid-November reopening," said Dudley Varner, executive 
director of the museum. The new location in the Kohl Corporate Center offers 
almost 32,000 total square feet, with about 14,000 to be set aside for 
exhibits. Plans for future exhibits include a robotic dinosaur display from 
Orange County-based Dinamation and an exhibit of space equipment mock-ups. 
</P>
<P>
The new building "is basically a shell," Varner said. That means some 
construction will be needed before opening, but also that the facility can be 
molded to meet the museum's needs. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the new interim site comes after a lengthy search that 
originally focused on the area around John Wayne Airport. The Aliso Viejo 
location is within a mile of the museum's planned permanent location, a 25-acre 
site in the new Aliso-Woods Canyon Regional Park. The museum's permanent home 
is probably at least five years away from construction. 
</P>
<P>
The museum may begin some outdoor programs in Aliso-Woods Canyon as soon as the 
interim site is open, concentrating on the ecology of Aliso Creek and on the 
Pectin Reef fossil area. All that is needed is a parking area for school buses. 
</P>
<P>
Varner said the museum hopes to open satellite sites in other areas of the 
county and may maintain a small presence in the present Newport Beach location 
-- at least until the county opens a planned nature center in the new Upper 
Newport Bay Regional Park. Previously scheduled summer programs will continue. 
</P>
<P>
But meanwhile, the main emphasis will be on getting the new interim site open. 
"We're hitting the ground running, so to speak," Varner said.

BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jewel Plummer Cobb, who has presided over Cal State Fullerton for the last nine 
years, steps down from the presidency Tuesday. Cobb's retirement -- and that of 
three other California State University presidents who are 65 or older -- was 
requested by now-ousted CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb took over the presidency at Cal State Fullerton on Oct. 1, 1981. Changes 
during her tenure include a marked increase in female and minority staff and 
students, tougher academic standards, the first hotel on a state college campus 
and a satellite campus in fast-growing South County. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb's successor, Milton A. Gordon, must contend with a financially troubled 
athletics program and the recruitment of qualified faculty to high-priced 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb will settle in Los Angeles, where she plans to do educational consulting 
work and continue her research as a cell biologist.

TEEN LOST IN ROUGH SURF AT HUNTINGTON 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A search resumed Saturday for a 13-year-old Compton boy who disappeared in 
rough surf Friday afternoon as lifeguards tried to rescue him and his two 
sisters off Huntington State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was lost and presumed drowned about 5:15 p.m. Friday after he became 
separated from his sisters in choppy waters in front of lifeguard tower 15 near 
Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
His name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers saved the two girls, ages 8 and 10, but their brother apparently 
slipped beneath the surface before he could be reached, lifeguards said. 
Earlier, the girls had clung to the boy for a while when they became panicky in 
the rough water about 50 to 100 yards offshore. 
</P>
<P>
The search, which involved a rescue boat, a police helicopter and 10 
lifeguards, began about 5:30 p.m. Friday, but was called off at nightfall 
except for patrols along the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the condition of an 18-year-old Lake Elsinore youth who broke his 
neck in the surf off San Clemente on Friday has improved, according to Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Swann was listed in serious condition Saturday. He had been reported in 
critical condition Friday evening in Mission Hospital's intensive care unit 
after being airlifted from a beach near the exclusive Cypress Shores 
neighborhood. Swann dived head-first into the ocean about 5 p.m. Friday and hit 
the bottom.

A 14-year-old boy, who reportedly knew how to swim, drowned Friday in his 
parents' swimming pool, police reported. No foul play is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
Brea Police Lt. Chester Panique said Jared Rex was found by his brother 
floating in the pool about 10 p.m. Jared was wearing swim trunks. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager's brother and father called paramedics and tried to revive the 
victim, who was rushed to Placentia-Linda Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Jared was pronounced dead at 3:57 a.m. Saturday. An autopsy is scheduled for 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Panique said that he does not know how the drowning occurred but that it did 
not appear that the youth hit his head or suffered an injury that contributed 
to his death. 
</P>
<P>
"The drowning was an accident, but we don't have a detailed report at this 
time," Panique said.

MIKE PENNER: GARRIDO II MIGHT PLAY IN FULLERTON

<P>
Potentially, the Great Fred Roggin/Augie Garrido Hoax represents an important 
breakthrough in electronic journalism: Next month's news today. 
</P>
<P>
Roggin, KNBC's local sports anchor, erred when he aired a report Thursday 
evening that Garrido had signed a two-year contract to return and coach 
baseball at Cal State Fullerton. Erred badly. Roggin went with the story, facts 
unchecked, after talking to someone identifying himself as Fullerton sports 
information director Mel Franks and claiming Garrido had just signed for an 
annual salary of $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
Two things immediately should have tipped Roggin that this phone call was 
bogus. 
</P>
<P>
One, the story was not on the wires. 
</P>
<P>
Two, when's the last time any school hired a coach and volunteered the terms of 
the contract? Especially at Fullerton. Especially at $90,000 per. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Roggin at 6 came away looking like Chili Davis in right, but there's a 
chance history will exonerate him. Garrido II is not on the marquee yet, but 
the sequel, as they say up the freeway, is in pre-production. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday afternoon at the Goodwill Games, where he is serving as an assistant 
baseball coach for Team USA, Garrido said a recent conversation with Fullerton 
associate athletic director Steve DiTolla convinced him that a return to the 
Titans was "realistic" and that he would formally apply and interview for the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"I did talk to Steve (Friday) about what they're looking for, what kind of 
commitment they're willing to make, and I was surprised," Garrido said. "Within 
the resources they have, and I know they're limited, they're doing the best 
they can do. They're making a hell of an effort. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . At this point, it's safe to say I will apply. They seem genuinely 
interested in turning the Fullerton baseball job from a stepping-stone position 
into a permanent position, which is what I needed to hear. Now I can take the 
next step -- and that's to formally interview with them." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Fullerton baseball is at a crossroads. For more than a decade, it has 
been the university's prestige sport -- two NCAA championships at Fullerton; it 
still boggles -- but now the man who built the program, Garrido, and the man 
who sustained it, Larry Cochell, are both gone. With Cochell taking Vern Ruhle, 
the prized pitching coach, and several Titan recruits to Oklahoma with him, the 
program has nowhere to go but down -- unless the program can revitalize itself 
with one dynamic stroke, a hire that could galvanize interest on campus and in 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
If that's the goal, Fullerton's top three candidates for baseball coach ought 
to be, in order: 
</P>
<P>
1. Augie Garrido. 
</P>
<P>
2. Augie Garrido. 
</P>
<P>
3. Augie Garrido. 
</P>
<P>
Already, it has been established that Fullerton is keenly interested. It wasn't 
until Friday, however, that Fullerton and Garrido got together on the same 
page. 
</P>
<P>
Having served there once, Garrido admittedly had his doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed to know if the program now was going to be any different from the one 
I left," he said. "Why would I want to return to the same problems I left three 
years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
Garrido always wanted to host an NCAA regional at Fullerton. He never could 
because hosting an NCAA regional at rickety Titan Field, Ol' 
Scaffold-N-Splinters, would be like hosting an Olympics in Blythe. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with a new on-campus, multi-sports facility due at Fullerton by 1992, 
Garrido might have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido always wanted to schedule home series against the best teams in the 
country -- Arizona State, Oklahoma State, Miami, Texas. One year, he got a 
verbal commitment from Texas, then the defending national champion. But 
Fullerton officials nixed the plan because of the financial guarantee it would 
have taken to bring Texas to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with a more baseball-friendly administration, Garrido believes he would 
have a chance. Garrido always wanted some help when it came to raising money 
for such frills as uniforms, scholarships and stadium lights. In his first 
go-round, Garrido says, "it was a one-man mom-and-pop store. . . . For me, the 
fund-raising aspect was so time consuming, by the time I got to the field to 
coach, it was like taking a break." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Garrido says DiTolla assured him "the administration is willing to assume 
some of the responsibility for developing a baseball budget." 
</P>
<P>
Talk, of course, is cheap, much cheaper than the cost of operating and 
maintaining a top 10 baseball program. Initially, Garrido thought talk was all 
Fullerton could offer. "They're dipping into pretty small pockets," he said. 
Initially, it seemed to be little more than a face-saving gesture -- Fullerton 
would make Garrido an offer he could refuse, announce that it tried to get the 
best man for the job and then begin interviewing candidates it could afford. 
But then DiTolla talked to Garrido Friday and the outline presented to the 
coach was, in Garrido's words, "surprising." 
</P>
<P>
"There have been some changes," Garrido said. "They're building a stadium. 
They've got a new president. Fullerton . . . wants to maintain the high level 
that baseball has had. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to be realistic. I know they can't get into a situation where they're 
robbing Peter to pay Paul, giving things to me when other coaches and programs 
are fighting for their lives. "I'm not a martyr. But if my family is able to 
function, money isn't everything. I really care about the Fullerton program. 
There are a lot of opportunities there. It sounds like they're trying to get 
something done." 
</P>
<P>
More than mouths to feed, Garrido also has an ego to feed. That's why the 
possibility of returning to Fullerton with the title of associate athletic 
director interests him. That's why all the commotion about his potential 
return, Roggin prank included, excites him. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the Angel-Mariner game last night and some of the Angel coaches said 
they wanted to see me back," Garrido said. "I talked to (Seattle pitcher) Mike 
Schooler, one of my old players, and he thought I should go back. Today, I 
heard guys in the stands yelling, 'Augie, let's get these guys fired up, like 
the old Fullerton days." 
</P>
<P>
The irony isn't lost on Garrido. 
</P>
<P>
Three years since he left for Illinois, his popularity around Fullerton has 
never been higher. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton has set next Friday as the deadline for baseball applications, with 
interviews to begin the following week. Garrido is committed to Team USA 
through Aug. 19, through the end of the world championships in Edmonton, but 
said he would request permission to leave for a day once a formal interview at 
Fullerton is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real interesting challenge," Garrido said. "You know, I've got a lot 
invested in the new stadium already. I'd like to see it happen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to start a ranch. It's another when you were there at the very 
beginning, clearing out the trees and the rocks."

MCCASKILL'S EFFORTS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO SAVE THE ANGELS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HE ALLOWS THREE HITS IN SEVEN INNINGS BUT FALLS, 2-1, TO MARINERS; 
LOSS IS THE FOURTH IN HIS PAST SIX STARTS.

If he could blame Saturday's 2-1 loss to the Mariners on the bone spurs that 
caused him to miss two starts earlier this season, or if he could cite a 
damaged ligament or even an old hockey injury, Kirk McCaskill would not have 
felt so achingly empty. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd probably feel better if I was hurt," the Angel right-hander said. 
</P>
<P>
Strange as that sounds, there's logic to it. McCaskill (7-7) no-hit the 
Mariners for 5 1/3 innings at the Kingdome and pitched with better stuff and 
better stamina than he has in months. He has pitched exceptionally well his 
last three outings, but in his last two has only a no-decision and a galling 
loss to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm completely unsatisfied,"said McCaskill, who yielded three hits and pitched 
into the eighth inning, his longest stint since he went 8 1/3 against the 
Baltimore Orioles on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
"You (reporters) will never know what it's like out there. It can be the 
greatest feeling in the world -- and the worst. The nuances of the game are 
hard to deal with. You can perform well and still lose." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill's only flaws were five walks, and the recipient of one of those -- 
Greg Briley -- scored the tying run in the fifth inning on a double by Ken 
Griffey Jr. Griffey tagged and advanced to third on Alvin Davis' fly ball to 
center and scored the decisive run on Jeffrey Leonard's single to right. 
</P>
<P>
"The runs they scored, it would be easy to look in hindsight," McCaskill said, 
"but I made the pitches I wanted to make in those situations. The thing I was 
most disturbed about is I walked so many people. I've been doing it all year 
and I don't know why. It cost me big tonight." 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't have if the offense had taken advantage of at least two 
opportunities. In losing for the sixth time in seven games, the Angels left 11 
runners on base, including three in the sixth inning. They left two on in the 
fourth after Brian Downing's sacrifice fly -- the first out of the inning -- 
scored Devon White with their lone run. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel for Kirk, and I feel for any pitcher when we score only one run," Lee 
Stevens said. "Kirk kept us in the game. You've got to give him a lot of 
credit." 
</P>
<P>
Seeing another courageous effort by McCaskill go to waste left Manager Doug 
Rader as exasperated as he has been this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a guy out there pitching with a broken arm," he said. "The guy's 
going to need an operation after the year's out. The guy's busting his tail. 
Unbelievable. . . . We had two chances to break the game open and we score one 
run in two big-inning opportunities. That's absolutely terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Asking what else he could conjure up that might galvanize the offense didn't 
improve his mood. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you suggest? What hasn't been tried?" said Rader, who has used 99 
different lineups in 101 games. "I think it's pretty obvious we've tried 
everything so far. We've done it all. We've tried everything we could possibly 
try to create a different offensive atmosphere, and we cannot seem to come up 
with anything consistently effective." 
</P>
<P>
Holman's sinker was effective for 6 2/3 innings, and he helped his own cause in 
the sixth with a spectacular play. Stevens had singled with one out and moved 
to third base on Lance Parrish's double. The Mariners walked Downing 
intentionally to match Holman against the right-handed hitting Dante Bichette. 
The strategy proved successful, if somewhat painful for Holman, when Bichette 
hit a shot that ricocheted off Holman's glove and knocked him off the mound as 
he completed his follow through. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being unable to stand, Holman managed to crawl to the ball and throw it 
home to get force out Stevens. "It was a lot of luck and a lot of 
determination," Holman said after the Mariners moved five games above .500, the 
latest point in the season they have had so good a record. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, 1-5 with four games left on this road trip, are feeling frustrated 
as never before. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making everybody look like superstars," Bichette said. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching well is some consolation to McCaskill, but not enough. 
</P>
<P>
"This is as well as I've thrown in a long time as far as having four pitches 
and hitting spots and making pitches when I need to," said McCaskill, who will 
undergo elbow surgery after the season to remove his troublesome bone spurs. "I 
hope it can continue and I can help us win. I'm getting tired of this losing 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Kent Anderson, recalled from triple-A Edmonton after Friday's game 
when third baseman Jack Howell was optioned, arrived at the Kingdome shortly 
after 4 p.m. because of travel delays. He wasn't in the starting lineup but was 
delighted to be back in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping to be called up, but you're always surprised when it happens," 
said Anderson, who was sent to Edmonton on June 30. "I was looking forward to 
it and hoping it would be as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson hit .271 with seven RBIs in 14 games with the Trappers. He split time 
between second base and third base. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' starting infield Saturday had produced 37 RBIs entering the game: 
second baseman Donnie Hill had 20, third baseman Rick Schu had 10, first 
baseman Lee Stevens had six and shortstop Dick Schofield had one. Schofield 
played Saturday for the first time since last Sunday, when he injured his right 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, who was hitting .208 with 19 RBIs, said he wasn't shocked at being 
optioned. "Once Devon (White) was sent down, I figured having the same numbers 
he had and having struggled at the plate the first part of the season, it could 
happen to me, too," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
Angel broadcaster Joe Torre, still awaiting word from the St. Louis Cardinals 
on their managing job, said a report from New York that he had already signed a 
three-year contract was false. 
</P>
<P>
Bob McClure pitched two simulated innings Friday and will throw again Monday in 
Minnesota. . . . After committing their 89th error Friday, the Angels are seven 
short of their total for 1989. . . . After striking out seven times Friday, the 
Angels totaled 606 strikeouts. Among AL teams, only the Texas Rangers -- at 646 
before Saturday's game -- have struck out more.

L.A. STRINGS TIE UP DUKES AGAIN; NEWPORT BEACH FALLS TO LAST PLACE

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second consecutive night, the Los Angeles Strings defeated the Newport 
Beach Dukes in a Team Tennis match. 
</P>
<P>
Friday at the Forum, the Strings' victory kept the Dukes out of a tie for first 
place in the West Division. Saturday in front of 1,403 at the John Wayne Tennis 
Club, the Strings (8-1) won, 25-24, and knocked the Dukes (6-4) into last place 
in the division. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the Dukes in the four-team division are the Stings, Sacramento 
Capitals (7-3) and San Antonio Racquets (6-3). A week remains in the regular 
season and only three teams from the division will make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes almost pulled out the victory Saturday, but Roger Smith and Marty 
Davis lost to John Lloyd and Larry Stefanki in the final set. 
</P>
<P>
The pair had rallied from a 4-1 deficit to tie the set, 4-4, but with Davis 
serving at 40-30, the Dukes lost the game to go down, 5-4. Stefanki then served 
out the set and match without losing a point. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes won three of the first four sets to take a 20-19 lead. Smith's 
victory over Stefanki in men's singles put the Dukes ahead. Smith won, 6-5, by 
winning the tiebreaker, 5-4, with an ace on the final point. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the play of Amy Frazier early in the match that kept the Dukes in 
contention in the late going. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier struggled in the early games of her set against Robin White. Frazier, 
who entered the match with the second-best women's singles record in Team 
Tennis, had difficulty with her forehand and her first serves and fell behind, 
4-1. 
</P>
<P>
But Frazier, a committed baseline player, turned it around by going to the net 
more times than she has all season, Dukes Coach Greg Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
"Amy just graduated from high school, but she thinks like a Ph.D. Her forehand 
was shaky so she went to the net," Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
After White held serve to go ahead, 4-1, Frazier won five consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
To open the match, the Dukes' women's doubles team of Frazier and Sophie Amiach 
opened the match by defeating Robin White and Anne White, 6-4. White and White, 
Team Tennis' top-ranked women's doubles team, had defeated Frazier and Amiach, 
6-3, Friday at the Forum, but the Dukes, ranked third, took control midway 
through the set, breaking Robin White to go ahead, 5-3. Although the Strings 
broke back, winning Amiach's serve at love, the Dukes then won the set by 
rallying from a love-40 deficit. Frazier closed out the game and set with a 
forehand return that handcuffed Robin White at the net.

O.C. LINEMEN SHINE -- FOR A FEW MINUTES; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: DAVID CUTTRELL AND LAWSON MOLLICA HELP CLEAR THE WAY FOR THE SOUTH'S 
91-YARD, SECOND-HALF SCORING DRIVE.

To run or not to run, that was the question in the South locker room at 
halftime of Saturday's Shrine all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive linemen? Well, they wanted to keep the ball on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
End of debate. 
</P>
<P>
What followed was one of the few bright moments for the South, which lost to 
the North, 19-14, in the Rose Bowl. For 4 minutes 56 seconds, the South offense 
played as well as any high school all-star unit can play. 
</P>
<P>
Running backs Samita Vaoifi, Ron Rivers and Chris Alexander burrowed behind the 
right side of the offensive line, looking for holes. David Cuttrell of El Toro 
and Edison's Lawson Mollica supplied them. 
</P>
<P>
The result was an eight-play, 91-yard scoring drive at the start the second 
half that gave the South a 14-13 lead -- a lead it held until the final 52 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The drive ended in a 17-yard touchdown pass from Jack Manu to Jason Green, but 
the rest of the yards -- 74 in all -- were picked up behind Cuttrell, the right 
guard, and Mollica, the right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the type of football linemen like," said Mollica, who will attend 
Pittsburgh this fall. "Even (tight end) Jason Green got into it. He was the 
best double-team blocker I've ever worked with. I would stand the defensive guy 
up and Jason would take him out." 
</P>
<P>
Vaoifi was the main beneficiary of the offensive line's domination. Vaoifi, a 
graduate of Fontana High, started the drive with a 13-yard run and had 47 yards 
in four carries during the march. 
</P>
<P>
The 74 yards rushing were 14 more than the South gained rushing in the entire 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
"We were throwing the ball too much in the first half," said Cuttrell, who will 
attend Oregon this fall. "Anybody can pass-block. It's run-blocking that makes 
the lineman. We showed everyone that on that drive." 
</P>
<P>
The South switched to a full-house backfield and used two tight ends at the 
start of the third quarter, a radical departure from the first half. The South 
had used a variety of formations in the first half, sometimes involving three 
wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
The change was due in part to the linemen, who insisted they could dominate in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"The running backs were on our side too," Cuttrell said. "We went out there and 
did our job. We opened the holes and the backs executed. The North looked like 
they were on skates. They didn't want any part of what we had going." 
</P>
<P>
This was the second all-star game for Cuttrell and Mollica this summer. They 
played side by side for the South in the Orange County all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
The South won that game, 22-9. 
</P>
<P>
"We passed too much in that one," Cuttrell said. "But playing with Lawson is 
great. He's a fun guy, but a little crazy. Of course, he says the same thing 
about me." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the South, the Cuttrell-Mollica connection was good for only 
one series. The North adjusted after the touchdown drive and held the South to 
44 yards rushing in the final 1 1/2 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"They started slanting to our side more, which took the running game away from 
us," Mollica said. "But that one drive was beautiful. That was football."

EXPERTS QUESTION FUTURE OF O.C. MANUFACTURING; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: THE DEPARTURE OF SOME MAJOR MANUFACTURERS HAS RAISED A WARNING FLAG. 
THE NEW SERVICE AND RETAIL BUSINESSES MOVING IN TYPICALLY PAY LESS, PRODUCE 
LESS AND HIRE FAR FEWER WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's economy, celebrated far and wide as one of the healthiest in 
the world, is beginning to look a little peaked to a small but growing group of 
economists and business people. 
</P>
<P>
Warning signs have been developing for years: an increasingly congested 
transportation system, steadily declining air quality and housing prices that 
are beginning to exclude all but the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
The latest symptom was identified by Chapman College economist James Doti in 
his prediction last month that the number of manufacturing jobs in Orange 
County would decline this year for the first time ever. His forecast, however, 
is at odds with a state study that predicts a slight increase in manufacturing 
jobs in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Doti is accurate, a decline in manufacturing jobs does not 
necessarily portend dire consequences for the local economy or even for all 
manufacturing within the county. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, his is one of several voices that is beginning to raise questions 
about the long-range impact on the county of a shrinking manufacturing base. 
Among the concerns: What happens as the county's vaunted economic diversity 
diminishes, and what kind of society will be left if much of the blue-collar 
middle class is driven away? 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Orange County's economy and its business base still are growing. 
Just recently, for example, aerospace giant Rockwell International announced 
plans to move its corporate offices from El Segundo to Seal Beach, bringing 235 
jobs into the county. And Toshiba Corp. last year said it would spend $9 
million to expand its Irvine electronics plant, creating 145 manufacturing jobs 
by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Still, more manufacturing jobs are leaving than arriving, Doti maintains, and 
as a result, many of the new businesses coming into the county are simply 
replacing ones that left rather than helping the economy grow. 
</P>
<P>
The county's climate and lifestyle attract corporate executives who set up 
headquarters operations near their homes in Newport Beach and Irvine; its 
central Southern California locale makes it an ideal place for distribution and 
shipping businesses. Even some manufacturers -- especially those in high-tech 
fields, which require a skilled work force -- find the county a desirable 
place. But traditional labor-intensive manufacturers are increasingly finding 
the county a tough place in which to remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Their departure -- to other parts of California or to other states -- 
represents a manufacturing drain that could portend a "frightening" economic 
future, says Mark Baldassare, a UCI social ecology professor and local opinion 
pollster. Orange County, he contends, "will become irrelevant to the Southern 
California economy if it continues losing manufacturing jobs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Litany of Problems 
</P>
<P>
Ask Ray Jensen, owner of Automotive Parts Exchange in Orange. He began moving 
most of his business to Yuma, Ariz., this month. 
</P>
<P>
The move, which will mean the direct loss of 370 jobs if the entire facility is 
relocated, was spurred by a familiar litany of problems: costly labor, 
expensive real estate, stringent regional pollution controls, a congested 
transportation system and housing so expensive that workers are fleeing the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The county's 3.2% unemployment rate means that skilled manufacturing workers 
are no longer available at a competitive wage, Jensen said. In addition, 
California workers compensation insurance premiums, among the highest in the 
nation, are eating up his profits, as are tougher air quality rules. 
</P>
<P>
By moving to Yuma -- where rents are cheaper and a 25% jobless rate provides a 
plentiful labor pool -- Jensen figures to save $12,000 a month in operating 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a native of Southern California, my family is native and most of my 
workers are natives, so you can imagine how much this move is hurting me," he 
said. But the move means that his business -- remanufacturing automobile 
starters and alternators -- can stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
By the most conservative measure available, the loss of as many as 370 
manufacturing jobs in the county also means the loss of as many as 237 related 
jobs in retail, service and construction, according to a U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen's company is one of just a trickle of businesses leaving the county. 
Business development experts say that there are in fact more firms moving into 
the county than out of it. The problem, experts say, is that most of the 
newcomers are in service and retail: accountants, lawyers, fast-food 
restaurants, hair salons, clothing stores and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
And that is cause for worry. Service and retail businesses typically pay less, 
produce less and hire far fewer workers than those in manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
The number of manufacturing jobs as a percentage of the total work force in the 
county has been shrinking steadily since the late 1950s. Then, manufacturing 
provided about 40% of the county's non-farm jobs. Now it represents only 22% of 
the non-agricultural jobs, according to the state Employment Development 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
If Doti is correct and the county now faces an accelerated decline in 
manufacturing, the economy will become even more dependent on service 
industries. "And because the services are also dependent on manufacturing, we 
could lose some of those businesses too," worries Leland Oliver, chairman of 
the Orange County Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dynamics of Mix 
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, several of the county's largest manufacturing 
employers have left the county: Weiser Lock in Huntington Beach, with 1,100 
workers, and Northrop Corp. in Anaheim, with 1,600 employees. 
</P>
<P>
In a county where 80% of all businesses have 10 or fewer employees, the loss of 
one large employer like Weiser may only be compensated for with the addition of 
dozens of small firms. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Doti's forecast misses the mark on a manufacturing decline, the state 
Employment Development Department's forecast of almost stagnant growth and an 
anticipated drop in higher-skilled manufacturing employment raises two 
significant questions for a county in which manufacturing is becoming less and 
less important in the economic mix: 
</P>
<P>
* Can Orange County maintain a dynamic economy with a shrunken manufacturing 
base? 
</P>
<P>
* And why is manufacturing so critical in what many are calling the 
post-industrial age? 
</P>
<P>
The why has to do with the strong supporting role that manufacturing plays in a 
balanced, healthy economy. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that the total number of businesses in Orange County is at an 
all-time high -- more than 80,000 are in operation this year, according to 
estimates from the county Chamber of Commerce and the privately published 
Contacts Influential business directory. 
</P>
<P>
But it is also true that a lot of those businesses are service companies, 
formed to provide services to other businesses or to individuals: accounting 
and law firms, management consultants, organizational experts, printing and 
copying firms, catering companies, barbers, auto detailers -- the list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Economists say that manufacturing is the force that drives the economy. 
</P>
<P>
While manufacturing accounts for only about 21% of the gross national product, 
for example, manufactured goods account for 49% of the nation's foreign trade 
income; service industries, by contrast, have a 19% share of foreign trade, 
said Denny Gulino, a spokesman for the National Assn. of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
More support for manufacturing's claim to a major role in the economy comes 
from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in its 1984 study of the impact of 100 new 
manufacturing jobs on a community. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that 100 new manufacturing jobs create 64 non-manufacturing 
jobs -- 45 in the wholesale and retail trades, including entertainment and 
recreation; seven in transportation, and the remainder in finance, insurance, 
real estate, business repairs and services, construction and public 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
Those 100 new manufacturing jobs also support seven new retail establishments, 
generate more than $2.4 million a year in personal income and account for more 
than $1.8 million a year in local retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
Although the study was done six years ago, chamber officials say it is not 
outdated. If anything, they say, the effects are even greater today than they 
were then. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, by the U.S. Chamber's estimate, the 1,200 manufacturing jobs Doti 
predicts will be lost to the county by the end of 1992 will eliminate nearly 
$30 million a year in personal income and almost $19 million a year in retail 
sales from the county. There will no longer be a demand for almost 90 retail 
stores and about 800 non-manufacturing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But Doti thinks the chamber's numbers are far too conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing workers in Orange County tend to be more skilled and highly paid 
than those in many other areas. And manufacturing firms here tend to be small 
and highly technical. Further, local manufacturers rely heavily on outside 
suppliers for raw materials, product components and such business services as 
payroll preparation, personnel administration and bookkeeping, thus creating 
more need for service businesses than do manufacturers in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not be at all surprised if the multiplier effect (of manufacturing 
jobs) wasn't more like 2 or 3 to 1," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And that means the impact of each lost manufacturing job could be three to five 
times greater than suggested in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce study. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regional Upheaval 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of areas, including entire regions, that have switched their 
economic bases from manufacturing to services -- or from services to 
manufacturing -- and survived, but almost all have undergone wrenching economic 
and social upheaval during the transition, said Robert Burchell of the Rutgers 
University Center for Urban Policy Research. 
</P>
<P>
"New Jersey had a significant manufacturing base well into the 1960s, but since 
then has turned around almost exclusively to be a service economy," Burchell 
said. "And what that has wrought, very clearly, is a dual economy. Those who 
can participate with two or more household members working in the service 
economy do fine. But when only one member can participate, they do less well, 
and those who cannot make the transformation from manufacturing to service jobs 
are bringing up the rear with incredibly shrunken incomes." 
</P>
<P>
A healthy business diversity has kept that from happening in Orange County, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But manufacturing, the most rapidly shrinking part of the county's economy, has 
always been part of that diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Another region often compared to Orange County is the Boston metropolitan area, 
said Sara Johnson, an economist with DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
And the economy there is in a shambles right now. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably is time for concern," Johnson said. "When economic growth slows 
across the U.S., boom places like Orange County slow down a lot more 
dramatically than bust places." 
</P>
<P>
There are parallels between Orange County and the Boston area, she said, in the 
growth over the past decade of the service and electronics industries in both 
places. 
</P>
<P>
Extremely low unemployment rates like Orange County's have been experienced in 
Boston as well. Last year, fast-food restaurants and other lower-paying retail 
businesses in that city were importing workers from out of state to help meet 
the demand for employees. 
</P>
<P>
That has since ended, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the computer industry has excess capacity and faces a much more 
competitive situation, so companies are no longer enjoying large profit margins 
and are facing more pressures to streamline and cut back," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she does not see the problems being as great in Southern California 
"because, in terms of economic growth, the area continues to draw new 
population, and that isn't the case here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Population Factor 
</P>
<P>
But while some parts of Southern California -- especially the Inland Empire, 
Ventura County and the Simi and Antelope valleys -- are drawing new residents, 
Orange County has begun slackening off. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapman College Center for Economic Research forecasts that population 
growth from people moving into Orange County will fall to almost zero this year 
and could well head into negative numbers in 1991 or 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next decade, Doti said, the county's population increase will all be 
accounted for by growth in the under-10 age group. "And they don't buy houses 
or cars or go to restaurants or support many of the services and retail 
businesses" that make up so much of the county's economic base, Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pushing a big part of the 20- to 35-year-old cohort out of the county 
and into Riverside and San Bernardino," said UCI social ecologist Baldassare. 
"And it is more likely that the jobs will move out to them in the future than 
that they will move back to fill slots that are emptying in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Doti holds out hope, however. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county's employment has stopped its rapid growth and although 
manufacturing will shrink, he said, the jobs that remain and that are being 
pulled into the county will be highly skilled and generally well-paid 
corporate, service, research and technical and medical manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
"And the thing I'm most optimistic about," Doti said, "is the incredible 
opportunity for global trade and Orange County's logical role as the West Coast 
center for the Pacific Rim trade." 
</P>
<P>
But global trade is based on manufactured goods, not consulting and management 
services, said Baldassare, whose research specialty is the changing suburban 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire state's economic future rests in its ability to conduct 
international trade," he said, "but Orange County will be missing a major 
element without a manufacturing base. It is manufactured goods that will be 
traded to Europe and Asia -- there's just not a big overseas market for 
California attorneys and consultants." 
</P>
<P>
That is conjecture. But there are economic events, "happening right now, that 
are more frightening when you consider the county's future," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
To turn around its manufacturing decline, the county must counter aggressive 
recruiting efforts from other metropolitan areas. Yet the county's major 
outreach tool, the Economic Development Council, has been allowed to die. 
</P>
<P>
"And while other areas are recruiting employers away from us and taking them to 
the Inland Empire and the Central Valley and Arizona," Baldassare said, "we are 
busily trying to find sites outside of Orange County for our airports and jails 
and affordable housing. That's not the kind of thinking that gave us the 
diversity that has made this such a healthy economy." 
</P>
<P>
While jails and airports and low-cost housing developments may be undesirable 
to existing residents in the immediate area, Baldassare said, "they create a 
demand for services and manufactured goods that create jobs for the regional 
economy. By moving such things into Riverside and San Bernardino, we are 
creating a situation that will come back to haunt us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FUTURE OF MANUFACTURING IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
Storm clouds on the county's once-golden horizon are prompting some 
manufacturers to seek sunnier business climates. And economic forecasters are 
predicting little or no growth in this vital economic sector over the next few 
years as manufactures flee high labor costs and stringent environmental rules. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STATE ESTIMATE 
</P>
<P>
The state Employment Development Department predicts that manufacturing in 
Orange County will continue to grow by 2% between 1989 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In percentage change, 1989 to 1992 
</P>
<P>
Non-durable goods: +11.2% 
</P>
<P>
Durable goods: -2.3% 
</P>
<P>
TOTAL: +2.0% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHAPMAN ESTIMATE 
</P>
<P>
But economists at Chapman College see a net loss in manufacturing jobs for at 
least the next three years, with a net decline of 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
In percentage change, 1989 to 1992 
</P>
<P>
Non-durable goods: +8.4% 
</P>
<P>
Durable goods: -3.8% 
</P>
<P>
TOTAL: -0.5% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PRICE OF RELOCATION 
</P>
<P>
Officials of one large county manufacturing firm that has recently moved to 
Arizona agreed to share the results of their site selection study on the 
condition that the firm, which employed about 1,000, not be identified.

LIVING IN FEAR;

<P>
SPECIALISTS ACT TO HELP CHILDREN TOUCHED BY NEIGHBORHOOD VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maribel Plascencia is a bright, sturdy, likable 11-year-old who can describe, 
without losing eye contact, the prostitution and drugs that used to plague her 
Anaheim neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
If asked, she will recite matter of factly the details of a murder she saw -- a 
fatal stabbing that followed a drunken argument over barbecued hot dogs -- 
almost as if she had watched it on television that very day. 
</P>
<P>
She was 6 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Her brother, Francisco, 8, is also wide-eyed but wary. Only with his mother's 
prodding will he reveal that a neighbor pushed cocaine up the child's nose two 
years ago. As he speaks, he pounds a half-hearted fist into his palm, his eyes 
dart back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, he has never told anyone outside the family because he believed that 
the neighbor, who moved the same day as the incident, would kill his family. 
</P>
<P>
These children belong to a new generation growing up amid violence of an extent 
and intensity unthinkable to previous generations. Over the past 25 years, 
homicide rates for children have at least doubled in all age groups, giving 
this country the developed world's highest death rate for children. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, California in particular has seen a spate of mass 
violence involving children -- shooting sprees at schools in South Central Los 
Angeles and Stockton and at a McDonald's in San Ysidro. Four years ago, a woman 
committed suicide in front of elementary school children at Panorama School in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
But more common, and less publicized, is the skyrocketing violence closer to 
home -- the weekend fighting, the random shootings, the spousal beatings -- 
that have become as much a part of growing up as losing baby teeth for an 
increasing number of children in Orange County -- a place known as a suburban 
dreamland, ideal for raising children. 
</P>
<P>
Said Michael Wellins, a crisis-intervention specialist with the Orange Police 
Department who is the county's only full-time therapist on a police department 
staff: "You no longer have a sense of it's not going to happen here, you see so 
much of it." 
</P>
<P>
It has happened in a Santa Ana living room, where a bullet fired from the 
street struck an 8-year-old watching TV. It has happened in the Orange Mall, 
where a 12-year-old brandished a gun and accidentally killed a friend. It has 
even happened on a ride at Disneyland, where a bullet from outside the park 
wounded an 8-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the victims, many more children are witnessing death, suicide, 
assault, and, most commonly, violence in their own homes, Wellins said. A few 
weeks ago, at least two children saw an Orange police officer kill their 
abusive father. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, homicides reached a 10-year high in Orange County, skyrocketing 42% 
in Anaheim and 40% in Santa Ana. In four years, attacks by schoolchildren using 
weapons jumped 95% and the county now reports record highs in domestic 
violence, gang violence and officer-involved shootings. 
</P>
<P>
The end result is a climate of fear that has made families angry, numb, 
vigilant. Or worried sick. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a family who sleeps on the floor at night," said Gloria Lopez, director 
of Anaheim Independencia Community Center. "They are afraid somebody will come 
and shoot at the kids who are there and it's safer on the floor. They say, 'My 
bed is now a luxury.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mickie Camacho, 42, said her 7-year-old daughter, Emerald, mistakes 
firecrackers for gunfire since her 17-year-old brother died last September in a 
gang shooting four blocks from their Santa Ana home. When Camacho goes outside 
summer evenings to escape the heat, "She says, 'Mom, come inside.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sue Tonkins, a therapist at the Santa Ana Child Guidance Center, said: "I've 
had children say, 'I found a shell of a bullet in my back yard.' It's amazing. 
You look at them and they don't look affected. Their helplessness has become 
indifference." 
</P>
<P>
Christine Lopez, victim specialist for the Orange County Central Court 
Victim/Witness program, sees more children, some as young as 4, coming into 
court to testify to the violence they've seen. 
</P>
<P>
Often, she said, they stare into space. "It looks as though they are in touch 
with an entirely different world. In that stare, you can see so much pain. And 
you can see, if you will, a coldness come over. You can almost see that child 
trying to cope with what their eyes saw." 
</P>
<P>
What frightens many families and youth authorities concerned with the future is 
that some children cope with what they have seen by copying it. 
</P>
<P>
Wellins said that 45 minutes after the Panorama School shooting, a 
second-grader approached him, pointed his finger and shouted, "Pow!" 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Doebke, a children's program coordinator for a battered women's 
shelter, said she has seen 4-year-old boys speak to their mothers in the same 
abusive voice and gestures used by their battering fathers. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Weaver, principal at L.P. Webber Elementary School in Westminster, said 
second-graders have already begun to form their own junior gangs, imitating 
older neighborhood boys. 
</P>
<P>
"Understand, this is not a fiction kind of issue," Wellins said. "These kids 
are exposed to real, traumatic events such as the death of a brother or sister. 
It really leaves a stain unless that stain is dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
But while psychologists swoop in force initially upon the scenes of 
high-profile crimes where children are involved, in the most common cases, the 
children are often left to sort it out alone. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the children who saw their father shot by an Orange police 
officer, for example, Wellins said his job was to counsel the officer, not the 
family. Counseling the children, he said, would be construed as a conflict of 
interest. He did not know whether the mother had yet sought counseling on her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, parents do little to help their children. Either enmeshed in 
their own grief, or afraid to discuss death, many adults insist that children 
don't understand death and don't need help, said Tonkins, who also runs a new, 
free-to-the-public grief group for children at Fairhaven Mortuary in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, unlike the predictable stages of grief known to affect adults, grief 
washes over children in invisible waves, she said. "They may have very intense 
feelings, then act as if nothing's occurred, then come back into it. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are constantly re-grieving as they get older, going through different 
developmental phases, getting more understanding cognitively and emotionally. " 
</P>
<P>
What they need is a chance to express whatever emotions they have, including 
guilt, or anger at the dead person, she suggested. What they don't need are 
simple religious explanations or instructions to "be brave." 
</P>
<P>
Counseling, and particularly bilingual therapists, are scarce. There are no 
"warm," or call-in help, lines for children north of Irvine. There are waiting 
lists for up to six months at public mental health clinics -- even for children 
whose fathers have been killed, Tonkins said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no one, no one, going into these neighborhoods -- even when small 
children are involved," said Lopez of the Victim/Witness program. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main problems is denial that there is a problem," explained Mike 
Salgado, 29, a native of Santa Ana, who recently formed Parents Against the 
Gang Environment and runs it from his home. "County and city officials have no 
idea how bad the problem really is. Kids are seeing their brothers die, cousins 
die, and end up doing the same thing. No one is there to reach them." 
</P>
<P>
Even the Boys Club of Santa Ana is located on a street so unsafe that "you 
would not allow your son or daughter to attend it," Salgado added. 
</P>
<P>
To reach children before the peer pressure of junior high reaches them, 
Salgado, who witnessed a murder in his own high school, is organizing outings 
for boys ages 7 to 13 who have lost friends or relatives to violence. 
</P>
<P>
Though not the most common, the random, gang-related shootings provide the 
greatest jolts to a community, sending ripples of fear not only to surviving 
victims and witnesses, but to relatives, friends, neighbors and classmates, 
according to Ramon Daniel, a school psychologist in the Santa Ana Unified 
School District. And just hearing about a crime can be as damaging as 
experiencing it, specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets children crying, turning physically ill, sometimes being scared of 
coming to school. Because the same thing could happen to them almost anywhere," 
Daniel says. 
</P>
<P>
Mondays in Santa Ana, elementary teachers brace themselves for more than the 
usual unrest, Daniel said. "There is often a lack of concentration and high 
distractibility. Sometimes they don't talk about it. We have to probe and find 
out what's happening. Sure enough, here comes the story -- there was a drug 
raid, helicopter hovering over, all this excitement." 
</P>
<P>
Among the children Daniel has counseled is a boy whose father, a doctor in 
Latin America, was killed in a random freeway shooting. Two years later, the 
boy is angry, destructive, pushing, fighting. "He's angry he doesn't have his 
father." 
</P>
<P>
Like other professionals limited in what they can do, he hopes and prays that 
the boy can somehow work it out. 
</P>
<P>
Until relatively recently, many professionals assumed that children could work 
it out. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought children were resilient," said Kathi Nader, a clinical social 
worker with the pioneering UCLA program in Trauma, Violence and Sudden 
Bereavement. 
</P>
<P>
While research into adult trauma has been going on since the 1800s, formal 
studies of childhood trauma started only in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is known that each previous trauma can make a child more vulnerable to 
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, whose symptoms in children may include one or 
more of the following: 
</P>
<P>
* Hypervigilence, or being frightened and on the alert for danger constantly. 
</P>
<P>
* Reduced responsiveness to the world, similar to numbness in adults, but not 
always visible. 
</P>
<P>
* A re-experiencing of the phenomenon in dreams or play acting. 
</P>
<P>
In the UCLA researchers' experience interviewing and treating hundreds of 
children exposed to sniper attacks, school shootings, murder, rape, suicide, 
gang violence and natural disasters, they have found that not all children turn 
violent after being exposed to violence. Some become chronic victims and others 
become rescuers -- pursuing careers as nurses, doctors or police officers. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there is no reliable way to predict how different children will react. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA program uses therapy to help some victims recall and work through 
their trauma, but the obvious solution is to remove children from exposure to 
violence, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some children, like the Plascencias, are lucky. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood rehabilitation project that gated their community drove out 
much of the dangerous element, and their mother, Carmen, a non-English-speaking 
native of Mexico, has overcome her fear of police to become their active ally 
in a strong neighborhood watch program. 
</P>
<P>
Both Maribel and Francisco want to be police officers when they grow up. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Maribel wishes for a junior police patrol, a group of "mini-cops" 
who would roam the neighborhood, tell police where the drug houses are, go for 
help if people are in danger or just talk to kids about their futures. 
</P>
<P>
Other observers wish for grief classes in the public schools or more bilingual 
therapists or more supervised care -- none of which appears likely as 
governments prepare to pare their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Nobel, child-care coordinator for the city of Irvine, which operates the 
county's only warm line for children, said she is considering a proposal to 
expand it countywide. 
</P>
<P>
The new kind and degree of violence involving children is "a massive thing and 
we all feel overwhelmed," Nader said. 
</P>
<P>
"But one of the things you know with trauma is, as long as you're feeling 
overwhelmed, it inhibits something being done."

1 -- "Real housing prices may well reach levels lower than those experienced at

</P>
<P>
2 -- "Today's homeowners have little reason to worry. Over time, home prices 
tend to rise at or above the general rate of inflation making housing a solid

Thirty years ago, before the Foothill and Orange freeways were completed in 
eastern Los Angeles County, San Dimas was an unspoiled grove town isolated by 
the low-lying Ganesha Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"You really needed a road map to find the town," said Frank Cheney, a longtime 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
The town's early claims to fame were really only appreciated by citrus growers. 
San Dimas had what was then the world's largest lemon packing house. For 25 
years, labels boasted that local citrus was "grown in frost-free San Dimas." A 
hard freeze in 1913 ended that slogan. 
</P>
<P>
Little is left in San Dimas to mark that early era. Recently, the city's last 
lemon grove, a six-acre parcel at San Dimas Avenue and Arrow Highway, was sold 
to a developer who wants to build condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1960s, the groves, many weakened by "quick decline" disease, were giving 
way to housing tracts. The completed freeways acted as a funnel, easing 
building pressures in the Los Angeles area and spawning new development in San 
Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
Located between La Verne, Glendora and Covina, the community spreads out 
beneath the San Gabriel Mountains. It now has a college, a country club, 
$1-million lake-view homes, an industrial zone, sprawling shopping centers, a 
county park, two telephone area codes and 33,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
But not all of the city's small-town atmosphere has disappeared. Many street 
signs are in Western type. Wood plank sidewalks line storefronts such as the 
San Dimas Mercantile and San Dimas Feed &amp; Tack in downtown, giving the 
two-block long area a turn-of-the-century flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The downtown Masonic Temple, although not considered a historic site, 
nonetheless has a historic role in former President Richard M. Nixon's 
political career. His first public campaign stop was at the meeting hall in 
1946. Nixon's opponent was a hometown boy, Rep. Jerry Voorhis, whom he went on 
to defeat that year. 
</P>
<P>
The town's original residential area, which consisted of about 10 square 
blocks, has many well-preserved California bungalows, stone grove houses and 
Mediterranean revival-style homes dating from the 1920s. Small cottages in this 
area can cost $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the city's newer middle-class neighborhoods to the west of downtown, homes 
range in price from $225,000 to $400,000. In hillside areas that overlook 
Puddingstone Reservoir and a country club, homes are listed at $750,000 to $1.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
There is little open land left for either residential or commercial projects, 
said Lawrence L. Stevens, the city's community development director. The 
foothills are the exception, but hillside restrictions have made builders 
reluctant to break ground there. 
</P>
<P>
One project of 52 new homes, directly north of the Foothill (210) Freeway, is 
built around a community riding stable. The site had been a nursery. Prices on 
the 12 remaining unsold homes range from $269,000 to $328,000. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Debernardo lives in a 1921 bungalow chosen for its location -- walking 
distance from downtown. She and her late husband moved to San Dimas 25 years 
ago. "They'll have to drag me away from this house," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her oak-tree-lined street has several 20-year residents who have been holding 
annual block parties for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Debernardo, sitting on her porch with neighbor Louise Collins on a recent 
afternoon, still appreciates San Dimas' small-town qualities, but she doesn't 
yearn for its sleepier times. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to go into a shop and have someone know me," Debernardo said. 'But when 
you come to a rural community, you can't stop progress any more than you can 
stop wrinkles." 
</P>
<P>
Chosen Mrs. San Dimas of 1955, Collins arrived in 1939, a newlywed from Texas. 
Although her children would prefer she relocate, she doesn't want to pull up 
roots. "I couldn't fathom not knowing my neighbors," said Collins, who is a 
widow. 
</P>
<P>
Collins' favorite hometown institution is Roady's, a downtown restaurant that 
serves as a hangout for longtime residents. Coffee is 55 cents. Ham and eggs is 
$3.50. Debates on world problems are free. 
</P>
<P>
"Roady's is the answer to the U.N.," chimed in Debernardo. 
</P>
<P>
At 25 miles from downtown Los Angeles, San Dimas is about as far away as 
Woodland Hills, Anaheim or Rancho Palos Verdes. But it's far cheaper to buy a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, when Cathy and George Preston began house hunting, San Dimas 
seemed like a perfect solution. "We wanted to find a place that was more 
rural," said Cathy Preston, who moved from Temple City in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, George, who now have two daughters, Courtney, 3, and 
Kirstyn, 5, bought a four-bedroom home in a 12-year-old housing tract on 
Bristol Road. 'We got more for our money," Preston said. 
</P>
<P>
While her home wouldn't be considered rural by most standards, Preston likes 
the street's large lots, street-side mail boxes and quiet neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We're planning on staying," she said, noting that her home has appreciated by 
about $100,000. Nearby houses are listed for $225,000. Today, the family 
couldn't afford to buy in the same neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Bobbie Griffiths says the home she bought a year ago for $259,000 
in Via Verde -- and now wants to sell -- has declined in value. 
</P>
<P>
"The same size houses are selling for less," said Griffiths, a saleswoman, who 
moved to San Dimas from Garden Grove when she began working in Ontario. She and 
her husband, Steve, who has since been transferred to Kent, Wash., chose San 
Dimas because he had a friend who lived in town. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved here in March, and you could see the mountains," Griffiths said. "By 
June, you couldn't. The air is real dirty," she said. "I wasn't used to it. I 
can't say it's the greatest place in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Air pollution, of course, wasn't an issue for the area's first settlers, a band 
of explorers headed by Jedediah Strong Smith. He camped in 1826 at a swamp that 
was called Mud Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The long-dry springs are located on what is now Palomares Street. The street 
got its name from Ignacio Palomares, one of the two Spanish dons given immense 
land grants in the area in 1837. 
</P>
<P>
Palomares was tormented by cattle rustlers, who hid out in a canyon. He cursed 
them by invoking the name of Dismas, the repentant thief on the cross, and the 
rustler's canyon became known as San Dimas. Hence, the town's name. 
</P>
<P>
Like many foothill towns, San Dimas got its start when the Santa Fe Railway 
completed its line in 1887. With promotional rail fares from the Midwest 
dropping as low as $1, a land boom ensued. But speculation in 1888 was followed 
by a land bust in 1889. 
</P>
<P>
The railroad hotel -- a 30-room, 14-fireplace, four-bathroom extravaganza -- 
never had a paying guest. It was sold for $20,000 in 1889 to the J.W. Walker 
family of Kentucky, who became growers. The building, on the National Register 
of Historic Places, is now a well-patronized restaurant, the San Dimas Mansion.

SERIES 
</P>
<P>
Don Franklin has been set to join the ensemble cast of "The Young Riders," the 
ABC series about the young men who rode for the Pony Express in the 1860s and 
which recently won a Western Heritage Award. Franklin, a regular on 
"Knightwatch," will play Noah Dixon, a freeborn black liberally raised by his 
parents on the family's prosperous Texas ranch, where he was educated by white 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim and Daphne," a one-hour syndicated talk program starring the 
husband-and-wife acting duo of Tim and Daphne Maxwell Reid, will debut in 
September on King World Productions' Research and Development Network. If the 
show is popular on the test network's 21 cable stations, it probably will go 
into production this year for national syndication. 
</P>
<P>
Nickelodeon will explore the early days of television, circa 1950, to witness 
the creation of a mythical comedy-variety show in "The Sam Arnold Show." The 
new series, from "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd" producer Karen Stevens, is 
scheduled to premiere in January. 
</P>
<P>
English college mates and comedy team Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie will co-star 
in a new TV edition of P.G. Wodehouse's "Jeeves and Wooster," airing on PBS 
beginning Nov. 11. In addition to the offbeat five-hour comedy series on PBS, 
Fry and Laurie's BBC series "A Bit of Fry and Laurie" will be cablecast on the 
Bravo network starting Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
MINISERIES 
</P>
<P>
David McCallum plays a world-famous symphony conductor who becomes the target 
of a hate campaign by his ex-wife, Diana Rigg, in "Mother Love," a four-part 
BBC production airing as a PBS' "Mystery!" presentation Oct. 25. For her 
performance, "Mystery" host Rigg won a BAFTA award in England, the British 
equivalent of a combined Emmy and Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Principal photography has begun in Vancouver, British Columbia, on "Deadly 
Intentions ... Again?," an ABC movie starring Joanna Kerns and Harry Hamlin 
based on the ABC miniseries "Deadly Intentions." The two-hour thriller, about a 
paroled man who was jailed for plotting the murder of his first wife, is 
scheduled to air during the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
Three NBC movies planned for the 1990-91 season: Candace Cameron, Chad Allen, 
Josh Saviano and Danica McKellar will star in "Camp Cucamonga," a madcap comedy 
about a co-ed summer camp. In the crime drama "Cops and Robbers," Ray Sharkey 
is involved in the largest bank robbery in U.S. history, which was committed by 
cops. "Deadly Medicine" is the true story of a pediatrician who suspects that 
her best friend, a trustworthy nurse, may be a baby killer. 
</P>
<P>
John Lithgow recently returned from Kenya, where he starred as an adventure 
writer who fights to stop the senseless slaughter of African elephants for 
profit in "The Last Elephant" -- formerly titled "The Ivory Hunters" -- a TNT 
movie premiering Aug. 20. The film co-stars Isabella Rossellini as an 
environmentalist and James Earl Jones as an African police inspector. 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket Network will produce "A Midsummer Night's Magic," Magic Johnson's 
annual all-star basketball game to benefit the United Negro College Fund, for 
NBC. Michael Jordan, Isiah Thomas, Dominique Wilkins, Karl Malone, Spud Webb, 
Reggie Miller, Danny Manning and Kurt Rambis are all scheduled to play in the 
goodwill event, which airs Aug. 11 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION 
</P>
<P>
CNBC has made its "Smart Series" brochures, first diitributed only at consumer 
conventions, available to viewers as part of a consumer-education drive. The 
first brochure, "Send Help," contains step-by-step tips on what to do in the 
event of an automobile emergency. Viewers can obtain brochures bys bytacting

Explorers (KCOP Friday at 8 p.m.), a 1985 kids-in-space adventure with the 
euphonious team of Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix, has some of the antic wit and 
frenzied visual imagination director Joe Dante pumped into the Gremlins movies 
but, at the end, it turns into a crazy sundae with the nuts on top: a space 
cartoon climax full of nyark-nyark goofiness.

Dressed to Kill 
</P>
<P>
The brilliance of Brian De Palma's "Dressed to Kill" is apparent within seconds 
of its opening gliding shot. 
</P>
<P>
This variation on themes of sex, voyeurism, guilt and murder, in "Psycho" and 
"Vertigo," is a sustained work of terror -- elegant, sensual, erotic, bloody, a 
directorial tour de force. Echoes of Hitchcock are everywhere. De Palma never 
lets up. To his view of city life as a sleek-surfaced, unhelpful maze of chrome 
and glass, he adds an unlikely element: humor along with eroticism and terror, 
as seen on Angie Dickinson's face (above).

A CRITICAL LOOK AT CABLE'S FILM CHANNELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON, Michael Wilmington reviews films for The Times.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Movies may not be better than ever but, through the last decade, TV movie 
watching definitely is. Cable and the proliferation of new channels have 
shattered the old norms, turned the average TV set into a potential home 
cinematheque. 
</P>
<P>
For a plucky movie buff, with a cable guide and a VCR, there's almost no end to 
the cinematic riches available. Following: a critical guide to the best cable 
channels for the movie specialist. 
</P>
<P>
NO. 1 
</P>
<P>
The Rainbow Service: Bravo and American Movie Classics. Bravo and AMC are not 
uniformly accessible on all cable systems. But they should be. This is the 
premier service for movie buffs. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they show a broad variety of classics, uncut, uninterrupted by 
commercials. AMC specializes in what's usually called "the Golden Age" -- the 
Hollywood Studio period from the early sound era through the late '40s-with a 
liberal sampling of post-'40s movies as well. 
</P>
<P>
AMC movies are usually introduced by a charming host, Bob Dorian, whose 
intimate, avuncular manner and witty backstage anecdotes provide a perfect, 
relaxed background for the movies, both the good and mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo serves an even more vital function. It's often the only major outlet for 
foreign language film classics-or was until recently, when the station made an 
unfortunate experiment: temporarily downplaying foreign movies in favor of the 
kind of American or British medium-budget film often described as "quirky" or 
"offbeat." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Bravo was bowing to current trends; perhaps it felt it was recycling 
too many films. In any case, it is back to a solid foreign and American 
independent lineup with movies by Mizoguchi, Bunel, Herzog, Pagnol, Kurosawa, 
Eisenstein and Jim Jarmusch-and that, one hopes, is where they will stay. 
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining options, here are the best. 
</P>
<P>
PREMIUM CHANNELS 
</P>
<P>
Cinemax. This choice may seem surprising, but Cinemax is far superior to its 
sister channel, HBO, and the other HBO clones such as Showtime. As much as AMC, 
Cinemax is a station for movie lovers. Its policy: Try to annex everyone else's 
territory-except, unfortunately, foreign films, which it tends to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Cinemax shows Hollywood classics, usually from the post-'50s era, a variety of 
genres, recent Hollywood hits and, in the late evening, even a little soft-core 
porno to steal some of the blue thunder from the Playboy Channel. (Parents with 
tireless children should be aware of this.) 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cinemax regularly screens film noirs, and it has a monthly 
"director's chair" series that will appeal to incipient auteurists: William 
Wyler, Don Siegel and Frank Tashlin have been recent retrospective subjects. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney Channel. Obviously, the premium channel for families who want a wide 
variety of good children's programming. But a cavil: I have never understood 
why a network that owes its entire existence and heritage to animation would 
program cartoons so sparingly-and not only Disney's own. For the Fleischer, 
Warners, MGM or Paramount backlog one has to go to other cable channels; recent 
or classic foreign animation is generally unavailable everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Of the other premium channels, there's little to say. The Movie Channel has 
much more variety and adventurous spirit, but Showtime and HBO spend too much 
energy and strategy trying to beat each other to the latest over-hyped smash 
hit. The Playboy Channel seems fairly hapless right now: a flavorless stew of 
breasts, thighs and soft-core gravy. 
</P>
<P>
BASIC CHANNELS 
</P>
<P>
TNT. Nothing is black and white-and wonders never cease. Ted Turner, film buff 
bete noir for his colorizing antics and cavalier attitude, partially has 
vindicated himself by establishing TNT: a haven for all the great old black and 
white movies we thought colorization would destroy. TNT books classics or 
curios from every era of American film-concentrating on the MGM-Warners films 
from Turner's hard-bought catalogue-and juxtaposes them imaginatively. 
</P>
<P>
There is even, on Sunday, an excellent foreign classic series, hosted by Roddy 
MacDowall, which shows crisp new prints in the proper format: letterbox for 
wide-screen. TNT, even more than AMC, also ferrets out that rich, neglected 
part of our heritage, silent movies-though usually only on rare occasions or 
wee-morning hours. So what's the story on Ted Turner? Is this guy Jekyll and 
Hyde or what? If he's paying obeisance for his sins, TNT is a splendid act of 
contrition. 
</P>
<P>
Arts &amp; Entertainment. Along with Bravo, Arts &amp; Entertainment is the 
bulwark for foreign film devotees. And, in recent months, while Bravo was 
trying to awaken us to the delights of "Crazy Moon" or "Julia and Julia," 
A&amp;E, still booking films like "Death in Venice," "Danton" and "La Nuit De 
Varennes," seemed to be carrying the torch almost alone. Happily, it's now part 
of a general group-including Bravo and the non-cable channel KCET. In addition 
to its small monthly foreign language complement, A&amp;E also offers a diverse 
range of generally sophisticated films: from British comedies to Hollywood cult 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
Another Turner station, TBS, is only a step behind these two: it's particularly 
strong on Westerns and comedies. The other basic channels-including Lifetime, 
Family, WOR, WGN and USA-have their moments.

CONSCIENCE OF AN ART;

<P>
A SEATTLE SHOW OFFERS A REVEALING LOOK AT VLADIMIR TATLIN AND THE RUSSIAN 
AVANT-GARDE OF AN EARLIER ERA

<P>
Because they are so rare, exhibitions of the extraordinary art of the early 
20th-Century Russian avant-garde are always greeted with keen anticipation. And 
in light of the international events of the past year, normal expectation is 
further heightened. 
</P>
<P>
"Art Into Life: Russian Constructivism, 1914-1932" turns out to be among the 
most revealing exhibitions to have been mounted anywhere in the United States 
in quite some time. For within the larger parameters of this generally 
illuminating show, penetrating new light has been shed on the art of Vladimir 
Tatlin, an enigmatic and compelling figure who is central to the Constructivist 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Curators Richard Andrews, who is director of the Henry Art Gallery at the 
University of Washington, where the show may be seen through Sept. 2, and 
Milena Kalinovska, who works independently, have marshalled a talented and 
extensive team of associates and international advisers to manage this 
exceptional feat. The Henry Art Gallery is not large, but the ambition of the 
presentation most certainly is. 
</P>
<P>
The show is the first large-scale exhibition to focus solely on Russian 
Constructivist art. This fact alone makes it notable. The galleries are 
literally stuffed with paintings, architectural models, graphics, agitprop 
posters, visionary machines, textiles, designs and models for theater sets and 
costumes. (Remarkably, some 80% of the more than 300 works are Soviet-owned, 
and many have never before been seen in the West.) Sorting through an immensely 
complicated and argumentative history, one whose difficulty has long been 
exacerbated by the inaccessibility of much Russian avant-garde art, the 
curators have assembled a show of surprising equanimity. 
</P>
<P>
Tatlin, of course, is the pivotal figure in the development of Constructivism. 
From start to finish, the artist hovers about the show. Its very title, "Art 
Into Life," comes from a programmatic statement long attributed to the artist, 
a youthful merchant seaman and son of a railroad engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a good part of the explanation for the refreshing clarity of the 
presentation can be traced to its cogent understanding of the problematic 
relationship between Constructivism, as a genre, and Tatlin, as an individual 
artist. (Not surprisingly, Tatlin's work was also much in evidence during a 
recent two-day symposium at the university, held in conjunction with the 
exhibition.) The artist was, in an important way, Constructivism's conscience. 
</P>
<P>
In the galleries, one of Tatlin's radical 1914 constructions of painted steel, 
wood and glass, suspended in space in a corner of the room by stabilizing rods, 
appears early on. (More precisely, on display is a clever reconstruction of one 
of those long-lost reliefs, which are believed to be the first nonobjective 
sculptures made. None has survived.) Pointedly, this radical relief is the 
first thing you see after a dazzling introductory room devoted to "The End of 
Painting." It features startling canvases and panels by Lyubov' Popova, 
Aleksandr Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova, Aleksandr Vesnin and others. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the main body of the exhibition is introduced by a large photographic 
mural of Tatlin's landmark proposal for the "Monument to the Third 
International." (Three versions of the model were made, all of them also lost, 
making Tatlin's tower-monument one of the most widely admired works of art that 
nobody has ever seen.) A brilliantly evocative synthesis of sculpture, 
architecture and engineering, the tower appropriately precedes rooms divided 
into sections on the utilitarian role of Constructivist artists in the 
production of goods: revolutionary posters and propaganda kiosks, utilitarian 
objects for the home, a reconstruction of Rodchenko's 1925 design for the 
Workers' Club reading room, the theater, architecture and, finally, visionary 
design. 
</P>
<P>
This last, too, is dominated by Tatlin -- specifically, by his so-called "air 
bicycle," a one-person flying-machine dubbed "Letatlin" (1929-31), that never 
quite got off the ground. This remarkable, birdlike construction, which owes 
clear debts to the experimental studies of Leonardo Da Vinci, has never before 
been shown in this country. Meant to revolutionize individual mobility, the 
glider was finally displayed at Moscow's Pushkin Museum in 1932 -- the same 
year Joseph Stalin's Communist Party Decree on the Reconstruction of Literary 
and Artistic Organizations finally silenced the avant-garde, Tatlin included, 
once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the elegant contraption in the show was assembled in the 1960s from 
remnants of the three versions of "Letatlin" made by the artist. There is 
certain irony to be found here. At precisely the three moments in the Henry Art 
Gallery exhibition in which Vladimir Tatlin's decisive role is asserted, the 
artist is necessarily represented by a reconstruction, a documentary photograph 
and a makeshift hybrid. 
</P>
<P>
The general vagaries of time, coupled with the specifically brutal Stalinist 
repression of the 1930s, are of course to blame for the eradication of so much 
primary art of the Russian avant-garde. Yet, even from remnants and copies, 
Tatlin's powerful significance comes through. The reason, I think, is that, as 
an artist, Tatlin knew and trusted the incomparable authority that resides in 
the powerful artistic image. He wasn't simply making handsome utilitarian 
objects. 
</P>
<P>
Constructivism didn't always do that, often ceding commitment instead to goals 
of industrial fabrication and mass production. Constructivism has been 
notoriously difficult to define because, from the start, it was less an 
aesthetic program than a monumental question. 
</P>
<P>
Russia, it must be remembered, was not a modern industrialized nation at the 
time of the revolution. It was a feudal, agrarian state. Constructivism asked 
how art, which is embedded in an artisanal tradition of handmade objects, could 
proceed in any productive way in a revolutionary world enchanted by the modern 
promise of industrial technology, and possessed of utopian aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Tatlin showed a way. Take those 1914-15 "counter-reliefs," begun when he was 
29. What Tatlin achieved in his pre-revolutionary counter-reliefs was nothing 
less than the creation of an utterly modern Russian icon. In the years 
surrounding the revolution, traditional forms of painting and sculpture were 
increasingly claimed to be obsolete, the decadent expression of individualist 
bourgeois culture. The end of painting -- so beautifully encapsulated by 
Rodchenko's devastating triptych, consisting of three monochromatic canvases 
each in a primary hue -- would finally parallel the end of the bourgeois class. 
But what next? 
</P>
<P>
Tatlin's answer was to proceed intuitively, in an effort to make painting and 
sculpture thoroughly modern. Employing such new artistic materials as metal, 
wire and wood, his painted constructions built on the precedent of Picasso's 
Cubist reliefs, which he had seen on a trip to Paris but put to wholly 
different ends. Picasso's reliefs retained visual ties to still-life objects; 
Tatlin's were wholly non-figurative, exploring properties of form, material and 
space instead. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Tatlin's counter-reliefs and the religious tradition 
of Russian icon painting has long been noted. His reliefs projected outward, 
into the real space of a room, echoing the peculiar, inverted perspective 
depicted in Russian icons. Suspended in the corner, they also recalled the 
traditional placement of religious paintings in Russian homes. And Tatlin's 
concept of faktura, or the integrity of a physical material's expressive 
potential, was meant to create artistic forms of universal significance. 
</P>
<P>
As the revolution would transform society, so revolutionary art would attempt 
to transform the material world. In the dramatic social upheaval during and 
after the tumultuous civil war of 1917, Russian society, as it had always been 
known, was wholly displaced. Soon, Tatlin's prewar idea of creating a modern 
Russian icon made little sense. For me, the exhibition at the Henry Art Gallery 
offers convincing evidence that, in his post-revolutionary "Monument to the 
Third International," what the artist found was a way to make an utterly modern 
Soviet icon. 
</P>
<P>
The spiraling tower is a bizarre, wondrous, inventive, wildly impossible thing. 
Tatlin's plan was to build a construction of iron, far taller than the Empire 
State Building, and tilted parallel to the axis of the Earth. The swirling 
building, whose skeletal design upped the ante of the Eiffel Tower to an 
hallucinatory degree, would house four glass enclosures -- a cube, cylinder, 
pyramid and hemisphere -- which would revolve at different speeds. These 
crystalline buildings would function as communal conference centers, 
legislative offices and government propaganda centers. Finally, the great tower 
would stand in the center of Moscow, heart of the communal Soviet state. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, such an amazing building could not possibly have been 
constructed. The technology wasn't remotely available, especially in a largely 
impoverished, agrarian society where even rudimentary industry was a far-off 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
But neither was Vladimir Tatlin a fool. There can be no doubt he knew full well 
that such a building was impossible to construct. It didn't matter. As an 
artist, he had other things on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Vestiges of the religious meaning of traditional Russian icons will be found in 
Tatlin's choice of a soaring spiral path of iron and glass for his futuristic 
building. The 1920 model, which was pulled through the streets of Moscow before 
jubilant throngs, plainly recalls the biblical Tower of Babel, in which Noah's 
descendants tried to construct a tower reaching all the way to heaven. Tatlin's 
design captured the popular imagination as a shining symbol for the dream of 
revolutionary culture, fueled by utopian and visionary aspirations. Clearly, it 
was as a devotional symbol -- as an icon representing the Soviet ideal -- that 
the monumental construction was intended to function. 
</P>
<P>
Today as then, Tatlin's tower was a thumping success. The fact that the models 
no longer exist adds poignance to the sight of "Letatlin," the graceful 
flying-machine reassembled from fragments of the artist's three original 
experiments. Tatlin worked on models of this human-powered "air bicycle" for 
several years, from 1929 to 1931, after a stint designing clothing, dishware, 
stoves, infant nursing vessels and other items the state hoped to put into mass 
production. Given the hard industrial goals of these earlier projects, the 
exquisitely handcrafted "Letatlin" comes as something of a shock. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Letatlin" incorporates such industrial materials as steel cable and 
duraluminum, it is principally fashioned from a tensile skeleton of curved and 
joined wood, over which a skin of cloth is stretched. Recalling as they do the 
billowing sails and wooden masts of an ocean vessel, these materials hark back 
to Tatlin's youthful days as a merchant seaman. Ironically, wooden stretchers 
and cloth also recall the structural materials of painting, the bourgeois 
medium overthrown by Tatlin's Constructivist program. It's as if the artist, 
poised on the brink of the revolution's collapse at the rise of Joseph Stalin, 
had returned to the source to find a means for earthly liberation. 
</P>
<P>
Art was that source. Tatlin showed that, in revolutionary culture, painting may 
have come to an end. Art, on the other hand, had a vibrant reason for being.

<P>
Just when you thought that any pro surfer belonged on the list of the world's 
luckiest men -- right up there with Ringo Starr and Ed McMahon -- along comes 
Richie Collins. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach surfer, ranked No. 13 on the Assn. of Surfing Professionals 
tour, defends his Op Pro championship this week at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Collins travels to the most exotic beaches in the world, won $43,000 in contest 
prize money last year and makes more than six figures a year just for wearing a 
certain wet suit and endorsing a particular brand of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Collins is only 21, but he didn't exactly ride one long, smooth wave to the 
crest of the sport. This is a young man both driven and torn by his own violent 
instincts, a stormy relationship with his father and his "born-again" beliefs. 
He's afraid of heights and closes his eyes during takeoffs on big waves. He's 
also claustrophobic, which makes plane trips and wipeouts in big surf personal 
nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
His talent for riding waves -- he is credited with having invented the floater, 
a now-popular maneuver in which the surfer rides on top of the tubed section of 
the wave -- has often been overshadowed by his out-of-the-water antics and 
temper tantrums. 
</P>
<P>
After a minor traffic mishap in 1988, he smashed his own car windshield with a 
fierce head butt, sending witnesses scurrying. And he's so widely disliked by 
his peers that when he was jumped and seriously beaten (his wounds required 73 
facial stitches) after a dispute in the water, a lot of surfers figured Collins 
got what he deserved. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Collins has run an electric shaver over his head in 
much the same way he carves up the face of a wave, and the results have been 
some truly bizarre hairstyles, all designed to "make me look ugly." Now, his 
coiffure is more Mr. Rogers than Mr. T. and he is somewhat comforted by his 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
But Collins is still tormented by the demons of his past. Maybe most 
distressing to all who surf is his confession that he gets no pleasure from 
riding waves. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Collins sat down with Times reporter John Weyler in the office of 
Waves Tools, the Costa Mesa surfboard shop pioneered by his father, Lance, and 
discussed his past mistakes, his hopes for the future, his dreams and his 
fears. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. You started surfing professionally at age 14, considerably younger than 
most. How did you reach that decision and now, in retrospect, do you think it 
was the right move? 
</P>
<P>
A. When I was younger, I was surfing (amateur) contests and winning probably 
about 80% of them. The other 20%, I'd just jell out and lose or I wouldn't show 
up for the final. I wanted to surf (National Scholastic Surfing Assn.) boys' 
division when I was 12, but I was too young, they wouldn't let me. So I shined 
it and quit surfing for about a year. I was heavily into windsurfing, so I just 
windsurfed. 
</P>
<P>
When I turned 14, I turned pro and surfed a contest and finished 16th. Then I 
surfed anything professional I could find. I didn't do that great but I tried. 
I just got more and more into it. Everyone told me it was a bad decision, but 
by the time I was 17 and rated second in the (Professional Surfing Assn. of 
America) and had a string of seven finals in a row, everybody was saying maybe 
that it wasn't a bad decision. 
</P>
<P>
Then I turned 18, went to Japan just for the heck of it and took 17th in my 
first serious (Assn. of Surfing Professionals) event. Then I said, "Man, I'm 
going to go on the ASP." 
</P>
<P>
I have no regrets. I'd do the same thing again, but I'd do it a little 
different. I wouldn't have been so stupid on my money. I would've saved more. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kind of influence has your father had on your life and your career as a 
surfer? 
</P>
<P>
A. He's been a very hard influence. When I was a little kid, he didn't care 
what I did. He didn't want to have nothing to do with me. When I'd surf all the 
time, his friends would say, "Hey, the kid wants to surf. Why don't you take 
him surfing?" And he'd say, "Shine the little punk." 
</P>
<P>
When I was like 7 years old, I was riding an Animal Tracks board and my dad 
owned Wave Tools. Everyone was like, "Make the kid a board. He's out their 
ripping on a six-foot, egg-shaped single fin." And he'd say, "Aw, shine the 
punk." So I finally surfed with him once and he saw how good I was and decided 
to make me a board. So he made me a five-foot twin fin when I was 8 and I was 
really stoked on it. 
</P>
<P>
I started competing at 9 years old. He was taking me to all the contests and 
sometimes even when I'd do good, he just wrote me off in my face, like, "Just 
get your stuff, man, and let's get out of here. You're such a kook, man, you 
can't even surf." Here I'm this little 9-, 10-year-old kid and I just won this 
contest, and he's telling me this stuff. 
</P>
<P>
He kept laying that into me all my life. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You sound pretty bitter. How would you describe your relationship with him 
now? 
</P>
<P>
A. When I quit surfing for that year and started to sail with him a lot, he was 
stoked about that. Then when I came back to surfing competition, I went to a 
higher level. But he really wasn't behind me. He was behind everyone else. He 
knocked me all the time, calling me a kook. I always thought, "I'll show that 
guy, I'll be the best." 
</P>
<P>
In a way, I think he was jealous because I was getting more hype than he ever 
did. But in a way, I think he was stoked, but didn't know how to show it, so he 
was mad all the time. He was a good dad, but always knocked me on everything I 
did. . . . He made me want to be perfect in everything I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You've been quoted as saying surfing isn't fun anymore, that you're only 
concerned with winning a world championship. Is this a case of burnout? 
</P>
<P>
A. When you start surfing when you're about 3 years old and get really into it 
when you're 6 and start competing when you're 8 or 9 and turn pro at 14, you 
say, "Wait a minute, this is my business." Then there's the other end of it, 
not even surfing-wise, but making surfboards, designing clothes and stuff. Now, 
I'm on the tour and I'm trying to watch this (business) over here too. It can 
be a burnout. 
</P>
<P>
You come home from an event and your sponsors want you to go somewhere else and 
you just go, "Wait, man. I have to win contests and I can't just keep traveling 
when I'm totally burned out on traveling." 
</P>
<P>
It's a 360-day, year-round job. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So, do you find yourself thinking more about life after pro surfing? And how 
much longer do you plan on competing? 
</P>
<P>
A. Oh, yeah. But I may do ASP contests until I'm 40. If I'm still up that high 
and I feel like competing and hassling all the young kids, I'll do it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The fits of temper that characterized your youth seem to be on the wane. Do 
you think you've matured in the past couple of years? 
</P>
<P>
A. My mouth was totally out of control back then, but I've settled down a bit 
now because I've proved my point that I could do things. I'm 21. I did a lot in 
three years and I've got a lot to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
I've calmed down a lot. My dreams have calmed down some, too, but I still dream 
about wars and blowing people away, but I try to stay away from it. I don't 
watch as many violent movies. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a warrior for God now. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You've said that channeling the energy of your aggravated, stressed-out 
personality into your surfing is a key to your success. Has your less-intense 
approach to life hurt your surfing? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think it has slowed me down a little and lightened me up. But I don't 
care. I think making money surfing isn't as important as people's feelings now. 
(There was a time when) I didn't care about people's feelings. People write in 
to magazines and say I'm a real jerk, but they don't really know me. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Jesus wants you to be really humble, but once you're out on the 
playing field, your job is to go out there and kick some butt for the Lord. 
I'll play by the rules, but I'm gonna be strong and eager to win for God. My 
job is to represent the Lord in the water. 
</P>
<P>
God sets a plan for you, but I didn't exactly take a straight line to get here. 
If I had followed His plan from the day I was 1 year old, Richie Collins would 
be a different person. I'd be where I am right now, but I'd have gotten here a 
better way, a brighter way and a more happy way. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So, has your surfing become any more conservative in the process? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yeah. When I was 17, 18 years old, I'd hit the lip on anything, man. I 
didn't care. I can't do a floater on a six-foot wave anymore, I'm too scared. I 
used to float The Point (18th Street in Newport) when it was eight feet. Now, I 
don't do floaters (except in contests). I've torn ligaments in my knee, hurt my 
back, had my fin in my leg, no way. The only way I'll hit the lip that hard is 
in a heat. I'll save it for a heat, 'cause that's my job. 
</P>
<P>
I'm only 21, but I've been doing it for so long, my bones are just getting 
wailed. When I was 18, I was just radical, I just loved going off. Now, man, 
I'm kinda mellower, I'm watching the old guys, saying, "Yeah, I gotta be like 
them. I gotta use more wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
Q. You room by yourself on the tour, you don't hang out with the other ASP pros 
and you used to shave your head with the intent of looking ugly. Do you feel 
you have to alienate yourself to be successful? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yeah, I do. I watch a lot of talent go out there and they just hang out with 
the boys and party and stay up late and I can see it in their surfing. When 
they don't do it for a week, they surf better. 
</P>
<P>
Every time you get drunk, it kills your brain cells. You screw yourself up and 
you don't deserve to win. If they don't go too berserk and give us a bad 
reputation, it's fine for them. But they can have it. I've never taken any 
drugs. It's not me. 
</P>
<P>
God's blessed me with what I've wanted and I'm doing what I'm supposed to be 
doing. I've been going with a girl for about a year now and I'm hoping to get 
married next year. I don't need to shave my head anymore. 
</P>
<P>
You've got all these pretty boys on the tour and all these girls going, "Oooh, 
he's so cute," and then they'd see me and go, "Ugh, look at that guy." And that 
was fine. It was like, "Get away from me, you wenches. I don't need you to 
flaunt your bodies in front of me. I don't need the devil to blind my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Q. There doesn't seem to be much disagreement about your talent, but there is 
some division about whether you are sincere or simply cultivating a bizarre 
image to intimidate opponents. Which is it? 
</P>
<P>
A. It worked, didn't it? (Laughs.) I'm not stupid. I can't write papers, but 
you don't have to go to school to make money. I quit when I was 16. I'm a pro 
surfer. I made more than 10 grand this month. What do I need a diploma for? 
I've got this business. I could retire right now. 
</P>
<P>
I shaved my head to be different than everyone else. Everyone else on the tour 
seemed like they were clones. I took a chunk of surfing from here and took it 
over to here. It's a totally different image. A lot of people won't admit it, 
but I did it and I'm proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
Now, maybe, some kids shave their heads and they're gonna see me in O'Neill 
(wet suits) and they're gonna go out and buy O'Neill suits. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Last year, you defeated top-ranked Tom Curren to win the Op Pro. You later 
were quoted as saying Curren "surfs old." What did you mean by that? 
</P>
<P>
A. I never said Curren surfed old. That was all bogus. I said Curren's style is 
old because everybody copies him and I was sick of watching that Curren style. 
The way he surfs is unreal, but the (magazine writer) turned it around and that 
really (angered Collins). I had to confront Curren and say, "Hey, dude, I 
didn't say that." He said, "Don't worry about it, man, I know how they twist 
things around." 
</P>
<P>
I just try to do some of what everybody does, do it all, more of it, but with 
more fullness, more roundness. That's my style. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Since every wave is different, judging surfing is, by its nature, a 
subjective endeavor. Do you have problems with the way ASP meets are judged? 
</P>
<P>
A. If (surfing was judged) like ice skating, I'd win a lot more. I video other 
people and I video myself, and I mean they're surfing good, but I'm doing about 
five moves for every two they're doing. If this was ice skating and they were 
judging who did the better maneuvers and who did more of them with more flow, 
man, I'd win. 
</P>
<P>
I'll start off by throwing a quick floater, then come down and do a snap (turn) 
and then hit the lip and the other guy will just do the snap and hit the lip 
and I'll get judged lower. How's that figure? 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you ever confront the judges with these kinds of questions? 
</P>
<P>
A. All the time, man. They just go, "Well, this guy was surfing faster and with 
more power." What's the big deal of surfing faster if you're not doing complete 
turns? I can go straight down the line and throw a bunch of spray, it's easy. I 
can do it switch-foot. But let's see this other idiot do a full, roundhouse 
cutback, come back and hit the lip and come back and hit the lip again, bam. 
</P>
<P>
What's surfing about? They say there's not enough speed in my maneuvers. What 
do they want me to do, put jets on the back of my board? 
</P>
<P>
It's just like with my (surfboard) shaping. I get no respect at all from most 
surfers. They say, "Your boards only work for you." But if they don't work, how 
did I get this far riding them? And I've got these little kids coming up who 
are surfing my boards and they're gonna kick these guys' butts some day, just 
blow them out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
Wave Tools is backed now by, well, if it wasn't for God we wouldn't be nowhere, 
but God put me in the position where I am now, you know, winning the Op and 
getting all this publicity all over the world. Otherwise, this board company 
wouldn't be around now. 
</P>
<P>
So if this business is still in business because of me, I want it to be part of 
me and do what I want it to do. Or I'll just go, "Hey, I don't want anything to 
do with the business." And I'll let the thing go out of business if they don't 
listen to me. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You admit to being afraid of heights but your father can recall a time at 
Black Sand Beach in Hawaii when you were only 13 and taking off on 12-foot 
waves that frightened him. What drives you to keep surfing despite your fears? 
</P>
<P>
A. Every time I take off on a big wave, I close my eyes. I just start calling 
myself names. I say, "Go, you big (sissy). This is it. You've got to go." If I 
looked down, I'd freak and back out. So I close my eyes until I stand up and 
then it's too late (to back out). 
</P>
<P>
I do it because I have so much anger inside me. And I want to make all those 
people who said I couldn't do it eat their words. 
</P>

<P>
Michael Carbajal, who today becomes the first 1988 U.S. Olympic team boxer to 
fight for a world pro championship, was talking about his old neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal's neighborhood, 10 minutes from the gleaming office towers of downtown 
Phoenix, is an area of boarded-up homes, broken bottles and beer cans in the 
streets, and wrecked cars parked on weed-filled front yards. 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal, 22, grew up here. Now he is successful and makes lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
Scottsdale here we come, right? No. He is staying. 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal is a very unusual athlete. You get no glitz, no jewelry, no flashy 
cars, no gated estate. You don't even get an entourage of moochers. There is 
only Carbajal and his brother, Danny, and sometimes Michael's lawyer, Ben 
Miranda, an old school chum of Danny's. 
</P>
<P>
With Carbajal, you get something that seems somewhat out-of-place in American 
pro sports -- values rooted in home and family. 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal, a 5-foot-5 1/2, 108-pounder, will make $75,000 when he fights 
Thailand's International Boxing Federation light-flyweight champion, Muangchai 
Kittikasem, today in Phoenix's Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Yet Carbajal still 
lives with his parents, brothers, sisters and numerous nieces and nephews in a 
crowded, dilapidated but very happy home on East Fillmore Street. 
</P>
<P>
So he seemed startled recently when a reporter asked him when he planned to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would I do that?" he asked. "This is my home. I've always lived here. 
Maybe some day I'll buy my mom and dad a place of their own. But even if they 
move out, I'll stay here." 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, here's a guy who's earning more money than any U.S. flyweight ever. 
His $75,000 purse is his biggest yet, but he has had two $50,000 purses. He has 
a network TV deal. 
</P>
<P>
And should he win the IBF title today, and should his promoter, Bob Arum, 
secure a light-flyweight showdown with Mexico's World Boxing Council champion, 
Humberto Gonzales, Carbajal's purse would advance well into six figures. 
</P>
<P>
Arum said a year ago that his goal with Carbajal was to maneuver him into 
history's first $1-million light-flyweight fight. 
</P>
<P>
But even if that happens, don't look for any Italian sports cars parked in 
front of Carbajal's house or gold chains around the fighter's neck. 
</P>
<P>
When Carbajal needed a car eight months ago, he bought a '62 Chevrolet Impala. 
A couple of weeks ago, he signed on as a spokesman for a Phoenix Oldsmobile 
dealer, who presented him with a new Olds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice, I'm driving it around," Carbajal said. "But the Impala is still my 
favorite. It's in the shop now, getting all new wiring." 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, a reporter showed up at the Carbajal compound (Michael's older 
brother/manager/trainer, Danny, lives next door, in a house built in 1910) for 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter found Michael on the front porch, seated on a rubber ice chest, a 
towel wrapped around his shoulders while Danny gave him a haircut. Danny was a 
barber until the mid-1980s, when he realized that his scrawny little brother 
could fight. 
</P>
<P>
Success hasn't gone to Danny's head, either. The vehicle parked on his front 
lawn is a 1979 Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
Are the Carbajals frugal or simply cheap? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put it this way," one Phoenix boxing observer said, "Danny and Michael 
aren't what you would call big tippers." 
</P>
<P>
So, what's happening to all the money? 
</P>
<P>
"We're thinking of building a gym for the kids in our neighborhood," Michael 
said. "Danny and I have some land picked out, on 9th Street, so we're making 
plans." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Carbajal is one of the more intriguing stories of the 1988 U.S. Olympic 
boxing team. Much was made of his learning to box in a tiny ring Danny had 
built for him in an old shed behind his house. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter asked to see the ring. Moments before reaching the shed, Danny 
said: "Watch out for the pits." 
</P>
<P>
At that, two pit bulls, chained to a tree, leaped from behind bushes, falling 
just short of the visitor. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep them out here to guard the place," Danny Carbajal said. 
</P>
<P>
If Michael Carbajal becomes a champion today, his ring should be shipped to a 
boxing museum. It is 10 feet on a side. The roof is barely six feet high, and 
is held together by plywood patches, corrugated steel sheeting and 
two-by-fours. Faded posters of Roberto Duran and Carlos Palomino adorn the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one reason why Michael is such a good fighter on the inside today," 
Danny said. "There's not much room to run around in here, you're forced to spar 
at close quarters. And the little ring made him fight well laterally, too." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Carbajal never learned how to back up. There was no room. 
</P>
<P>
How hot does the shed become? 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know," Danny said. "The temperature gauge only goes up to 120." 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal, boxing in the same weight class in which East Los Angeles' Paul 
Gonzales won a gold medal at the 1984 Olympics, nearly won the gold in Seoul in 
1988. But in what many considered the most unfair decision to that point in the 
Olympic tournament, he lost a decision to Ivailo Hristov of Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people would still remember what a bad decision that was, 
except later that day Roy Jones (the U.S. light-middleweight) got robbed on a 
decision that was even worse," Danny Carbajal said. 
</P>
<P>
The Carbajals took the disappointment in typical Carbajal fashion. There were 
no tantrums, no howls of outrage, no tears. They let the U.S. boxing officials 
do all the protesting. Poked and prodded for comment by reporters in the 
interview room afterward that day, the quiet little fighter would only mumble: 
"It just wasn't meant to be, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, only a frown by the poker-faced Carbajal at the announcement of the 
winner betrayed his feeling at earning the silver medal instead of the gold. 
</P>
<P>
At the Olympic team's pre-Seoul training camp, Carbajal was the coaches' 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"He was great in camp," said Tom Coulter, one of the coaches. "He was the 
hardest worker on the team. He showed great discipline, great work habits. He 
worked very hard and never had anything to say. He won every sprint, every 
distance run. No one could stay with him on the road. He ran one 5:15 mile 
after another. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, his road work was so good I told him I thought he could get a 
cross-country or track scholarship someplace." 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal turned pro shortly after the Games and, with a 14-0 record, has 
remained one of the busiest graduates of the 1988 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Humberto Gonzalez's promoter claims Carbajal is ducking his fighter. 
</P>
<P>
"I've called Bob Arum and talked about a Gonzalez-Carbajal fight, and all he 
ever says is, 'Send me a video,' " Rafael Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nonsense. He knows perfectly well what a great fighter Gonzalez is, and 
he knows Carbajal isn't in Humberto's class." 
</P>
<P>
The Carbajals, of course, laugh all this off. After only two years in the pro 
game, they know a thing or two about promotion buildups. Both concede Gonzalez, 
who has 23 knockouts in his 28-0 record, is a formidable fighter. 
</P>
<P>
"They can talk trash as long as they want," Danny Carbajal said. "If Gonzalez 
is as good as they think he is, then why should we fight now? Let's let the 
fight develop. Why don't they go take the Korean's (Woo Yuh Myung of South 
Korea, the World Boxing Assn. champion) title? Then our fight with Gonzalez 
could be a unification fight. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason why they want the fight now is because they know Michael is 
improving rapidly, and they know Gonzalez would have no chance a year or more 
from now." 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal is exceptionally tall for a light-flyweight, and has a long reach. He 
uses his height to great advantage, with a busy, accurate jab. Inside, he is an 
effective, aggressive body puncher. He has stopped eight of his 14 opponents, 
and several of them have been clean knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent today is a former kick boxer who has defended his IBF title four 
times, yet has only a 10-0 record. And Kittikasem, until today, has never 
fought outside Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
For the past week, both Carbajal and Kittikasem have trained at the La Mancha 
Athletic Club and Hotel in downtown Phoenix, where the Thai champion, except 
for his workouts, has remained in seclusion. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Phoenix July 20 with a traveling party of 14. Jay Edson, Arum's 
event coordinator, said the first question asked of him when he met the Thais 
at the airport was if Kittikasem could be paid his $150,000 purse up front, in 
cash. No, the Thais were told. 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing they wanted to know was could they could set up security in the 
hotel kitchen, to prevent being poisoned," Edson said. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, Edson told them. Finally, an arrangement was made with a nearby 
Thai restaurant, Thai Rama, to deliver the champion's meals three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
"This kid (Kittikasem) is just like (Marvin) Hagler before a fight," Edson 
says. "He locks himself up in his room and stays there. No one sees him. I 
guarantee you he hasn't been in the coffee shop once." 
</P>
<P>
Kittikasem has fought only Asian opponents and brought only Thai sparring 
partners with him to Phoenix. For those reasons, one Las Vegas sports book made 
Carbajal a 3-1 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal was supposed to have had this fight May 13 in Atlantic City. But 
Kittikasem suffered a broken knuckle in training three weeks before the fight, 
forcing a postponement. 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal, who says his "walking around" weight between fights is 110 to 112 
pounds, has no trouble making 108. In fact, after the Olympics, Carbajal 
debated briefly whether or not to turn pro at strawweight, a division peopled 
almost entirely by Asian and Hispanic boxers and for which the weight limit is 
105 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
For brother Danny, who at 39 packs an ample midriff, the toughest part of 
managing his brother's career is watching him eat. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me want to cry," he said. "He eats anything he wants, even in 
training, and never puts on an ounce." 
</P>

DEUKMEJIAN CHOOSES EX-AIDE FOR HIGH COURT; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: IF CONFIRMED, APPELLATE JUSTICE MARVIN R. BAXTER WOULD SUCCEED 
RETIRING JUSTICE DAVID N. EAGLESON.

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian announced Saturday that he will nominate Appellate 
Justice Marvin R. Baxter, a key former aide who helped the governor make more 
than 600 state judicial appointments, to a forthcoming vacancy on the 
California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter, a lifelong resident of Fresno now serving there on the state Court of 
Appeal, would become the first justice from the San Joaquin Valley to serve on 
the state high court since 1859. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old jurist served for five years as Deukmejian's appointments 
secretary before the governor named him to the appeals court in October, 1988. 
Previous high court appointees named by Deukmejian have generally had more 
experience on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
If confirmed by the state Judicial Appointments Commission and then approved by 
voters in the fall election, Baxter would begin a 12-year term, succeeding 
Justice David N. Eagleson, who is retiring from the state Supreme Court in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, announcing the selection on his regular Saturday radio show, 
described Baxter as a "fair but tough judge who respects the law and the 
principle of judicial restraint" -- a doctrine favored by conservatives that 
holds that expansive changes in the law should be made by legislation, not by 
court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
"Justice Baxter understands that the role of judges is to fairly and 
impartially interpret the law and that our judicial system should show as much 
compassion for the victims of crime and their families as it does for 
defendants," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter would join a high court that recently has been plagued by unusually 
rapid turnover, adding to the burdens of a heavy caseload and a backlog of 
about 170 death-penalty appeals. Two justices appointed by Deukmejian in 1987 
-- John A. Arguelles and Marcus M. Kaufman -- have already retired and entered 
private law practice. The impending retirement of Eagleson, another 1987 
Deukmejian appointee, will mark the third such departure in less than two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Saturday, Baxter said he was "honored by the nomination and the 
governor's expression of confidence" and that, if confirmed, he would look 
forward to a long tenure on the high court. 
</P>
<P>
He noted, for example, that he would not reach a point where he could obtain 
maximum judicial retirement benefits until about 2008. "I would intend to serve 
as long as I am able to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter, a graduate of Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco and former 
Fresno County prosecutor, already has left a substantial imprint on the 
California judiciary through his five-year service as the governor's 
appointments secretary. 
</P>
<P>
In that post, he was responsible for the management and coordination of all 
gubernatorial appointments -- including the more than 600 judicial appointments 
the governor made during the period. 
</P>
<P>
"The appointments secretary job was a wonderful position," Baxter recalled 
Saturday. "That whole exercise of reviewing the records of prospective 
applicants and then briefing the governor was a once-in-a-lifetime experience." 
</P>
<P>
Baxter would be joining a high court that has undergone a major philosophical 
shift since the defeat of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other 
liberal court members in the November, 1986, election. 
</P>
<P>
Now the court, under Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, is markedly more 
conservative, affirming roughly three-quarters of the death-penalty judgments 
it reviews and granting employers, insurers and other businesses major 
victories they hardly could have expected from the liberal-dominated Bird 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, five justices are regarded as conservatives or moderates: Lucas, 63; 
Edward A. Panelli, 58; Eagleson, 65; Joyce L. Kennard, 49, and Armand Arabian, 
55. The two other justices, named by Democratic governors, are seen as 
liberals: Stanley Mosk, 77; and Allen E. Broussard, 61. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter's record as an appeals court judge covers less than two years and thus 
provides only limited indications of how he may perform on the state Supreme 
Court. But associates have said they would expect him to follow the same 
moderately conservative judicial course as other Deukmejian appointees. 
</P>
<P>
In a ruling last December, Baxter, writing the appeal court's opinion in a case 
involving the state news media "shield" law, held that reporters may be 
required to testify in a civil case about the observations they make while 
gathering news. The law, he said, protects reporters only from disclosing 
information from confidential sources. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, the state Supreme Court ruled, however, that reporters may refuse to 
disclose non-confidential information in certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
In other rulings, Baxter held last April that a Tuolumne County man could be 
prosecuted for burglary for the unauthorized entry of his estranged wife's 
residence and in March allowed a narcotics-possession prosecution against a 
Kern County man although a potential witness for the defense had been deported. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1989, Baxter issued a unanimous opinion reversing the drug conviction 
of a Latino defendant because the prosecution had improperly excluded two 
prospective jurors with Spanish surnames. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor had defended the use of peremptory challenges to remove the 
jurors on the grounds that newly naturalized citizens have difficulty 
understanding English and American law. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter said the prosecutor relied on a "blanket characterization" without 
questioning the jurors to determine whether they did understand. "The exercise 
of the peremptory challenge clearly resulted in decision-making by racial 
stereotype," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter's nomination to the $115,161 post is expected to be reviewed by the 
appointments commission in about 30 days. The three-member commission is made 
up of Lucas, state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and senior Presiding 
Appellate Justice Lester W. Roth of Los Angeles. If confirmed, as is likely, 
Baxter would then be subject to a confirmation vote on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEUKMEJIAN'S CHOICE FOR THE HIGH COURT 
</P>
<P>
The seven state Supreme Court justices serve 12-year terms after which they may 
seek another term in a confirmation election. Associate justices receive 
$115,161 a year. The chief justice earns $120,764 annually. 
</P>
<P>
"I am honored by the nomination and the governor's expression of confidence. I 
look forward to serving on the state's highest court and appreciate the 
opportunity for continued public service at that level." -- Marvin R. Baxter

JOHN DOE'S COUNTRY COMFORT; 
</P>
<P>
THE LINCHPIN OF L.A.'S '80S PUNK-ROCK SCENE WITH 'X' HAS FOUND NEW INSPIRATION 
IN THE GREENER PASTURES OF RURAL VENTURA COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LOCKWOOD VALLEY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a long way from Al's Bar to Owl's Barn, about 80 miles by freeway and 
country road from the downtown hub of the L.A. rock/art underground to the 
rural roadhouse that is now John Doe's local watering hole. 
</P>
<P>
But it's about a million miles in spirit from L.A. to Rancho Doe Acres -- the 
patch of land in Ventura County where Doe, 37, lives with his wife, Gigi, and 
their 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Veronica. A few neighboring houses cluster on 
two sides of the 2 1/2-acre, poplar-lined property, but to the south the 
terrain is all rolling hills, receding into the distance of Los Padres National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Doe -- who was co-leader with Exene Cervenka of X, the band that served as the 
conscience of the L.A. rock scene for much of the '80s -- hasn't entirely 
renounced his old life. He has released his first solo album, "Meet John Doe," 
on DGC Records, and he's just started a national concert tour that includes 
shows at Club Lingerie in Hollywood on Monday and the Carnaval in Santa Barbara 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But these days he's also busy tending to his two horses, the chickens and the 
rabbits, planning to pick up another load of hay while the price is down, 
lamenting the freeze that killed the tomatoes and the drought that kept the rye 
from coming up. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine a sharper contrast with the days when Doe was the punk 
era's premiere chronicler of the psychology and sociology of teeming, turbulent 
Los Angeles. But he can spot similarities. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still as much excitement, it just comes in different forms," he said, 
making a pot of coffee in the kitchen of his comfortably cluttered house as a 
hot, afternoon wind picked up outside. "Like the dogs cornering a raccoon and 
then flushing it out and tearing it to pieces. It's still just as serious. 
Still happens late at night too." 
</P>
<P>
If Doe appears to have made a radical change, he claims that the seeds were 
there all along. It sounds like a punk-rock update of the hippies' 
back-to-the-land impulse. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in say 1978, Exene and (punk-blues singer) Top Jimmy and whoever was 
around, we always talked about moving to a small town or moving to the country. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"The reason Hollywood was inspiring was 'cause it was such a beast. You were in 
the heart of all that. It wasn't a real love of it. It was inspirational in its 
insanity and its fast pace, and the fact that people can be a bum and then a 
millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought of Hollywood as a kind of a sentence, a prison sentence. You 
go in and you do your time and hopefully you can make your mark, and then you 
move out and someone else replaces you and they do their stint." 
</P>
<P>
If Hollywood was the inspiration for X's music, where does Doe find it now? 
</P>
<P>
"It comes from within. Stories, relationships. Things that you see when you're 
in the big city," he said, fitting a cigarette with a plastic mouthpiece -- a 
do-it-yourself quit-smoking aid that hasn't quite taken effect yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Inspiration just kind of happens," he continued. "People who painted battles 
didn't set up a canvas on the battlefield. They went and saw it and then came 
back home and did it. That was the way all our writing took place anyway. You 
were within it, and then you had to step outside 
</P>
<P>
of it to get enough quiet and peace of mind to actually put it down." 
</P>
<P>
On the side of the garage, hanging amid a display of antique farm implements, 
is the large, brown letter X that Doe liberated from the demolished Ex-Lax 
building in Brooklyn during one of the group's tours. It's the most prominent 
reminder at Rancho Doe Acres of the band that became the driving force and 
spiritual leader of the Los Angeles underground rock community. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you're able to appreciate what a big deal people are making out 
of you at the time they do, because you're kind of new to the whole deal," the 
singer-bassist said, reflecting on the glory days. 
</P>
<P>
"But I have the same perspective overall, because I knew that we were doing 
something worthwhile and it would stay around. . . . I think we did really 
well. We made some good records and the people who bought 'em and listened to 
'em got a lot out of 'em."

Though even Doe slips into the past tense when talking about X, he insists that 
the band, whose last album came out in 1988, will reunite soon. He remains 
close to his ex-wife Cervenka -- in fact, he was looking forward to singing on 
her album in Los Angeles the following night, with X's guitarist Tony Gilkyson 
playing and producing. 
</P>
<P>
The hiatus was prompted by a combination of events: Some acting roles came 
Doe's way, Cervenka moved to Idaho and X's last album, a live set recorded at 
the Whisky, seemed to summarize an era for the group. 
</P>
<P>
Doe suggested that the Red Hot Chili Peppers are today's truest heirs to X: 
"Not that the music sounds the same, but the fact that they're living the 
life." 
</P>
<P>
He's skeptical of the widely aired notion that Guns N' Roses and the hard-rock 
hordes are carrying on the street consciousness of the punk bands. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly that scene is the next major scene, but I think that it's all too 
much a part of the American dream to be right for me," Doe said. "That could be 
why there can be 5,000 people walking up and down the Sunset Strip nowadays, 
and if that had happened in 1980 or '79, the police would have closed it down 
and hauled everybody off to jail. Because it was threatening, and it didn't buy 
into the American dream, which is make a lot of money, flash it around." 
</P>
<P>
With the money he earned from his acting roles in "Roadhouse" and "Great Balls 
of Fire," Doe made the down payment on his property and moved in a year and a 
half ago. He and Gigi, who still owns her thrift shop at the east end of 
Melrose, are expecting their second child in October. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole deal of this is to have someplace to go, to maintain peace of mind," 
he said. "Working on the road for a couple of months and then coming back to 
the city, that's not much of a rest once you get back there. Hell, I only work 
so much out of the year, maybe six months out of the year. Why spend the rest 
of the time fighting traffic? 
</P>
<P>
"I like the freedom that comes with fewer people and fewer city services. You 
end up doing things for yourself. No one cares to comment on whether I make the 
corrals well. It's more relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
Doe spent his early childhood in small towns in Wisconsin and Tennessee, and 
didn't get a taste of city life until his librarian parents moved the family to 
Baltimore when he was in the third or fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really a shock," Doe recalled. "Kids were sarcastic. I never even knew 
there was such a thing as sarcasm. So I was taken advantage of, you know. That 
adds to your character in that you become more wary, but you still maintain 
this basic belief in people, that they're good." 
</P>
<P>
Doe seems faintly embarrassed by his record company's attempt to play off the 
album's title by portraying him as a sort of post-punk Gary Cooper, an 
archetype of the "common man." But it's not totally off base. Doe's heritage is 
Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly as well as Elvis and Bo Diddley, and there's a 
salt-of-the-earth sincerity in his left-wing idealism. 
</P>
<P>
"Meet John Doe," though, is predominantly an introspective album, which seems 
to trouble its maker. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was remiss, but there were a few (political) songs that were 
left off because they didn't seem to fit in. I just hope people are aware 
enough so they can say, 'Even though there's no political statements on this, 
it doesn't mean that he's shying away from it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Outside, the wind suddenly began to whistle loudly, and it brought Doe back to 
the earlier question of inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, out here natural things become symbolic. Like wind or weather, 
animals, things like that. Not using it in an idyllic sense or in a 
naturalistic sense . . . not where it's just nice to be out in the country, but 
where it can be life and death and it can be serious business. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully you don't experience it to that degree . . . but you can take it to 
an extreme conclusion. Those aren't necessarily truer or more basic feelings 
because they're natural. But they're powerful, strong forces."
