Prime time is of the essence for Diane Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The former "60 Minutes" correspondent, who signed a reported $1.6-million 
annual pact with ABC in February, joins Sam Donaldson as co-anchor of the 
network's new "PrimeTime Live," a news magazine that debuts Thursday at 10 p.m. 
on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer and Donaldson will host the series in front of a studio audience in New 
York. They will offer a mix of topical stories, investigative pieces and live 
reporting. As the title suggests, the programs will be live broadcasts, though 
viewers on the West Coast will see them on a tape-delay basis. 
</P>
<P>
And with NBC's "L.A. Law" and CBS' "Knots Landing" as competition come fall, 
ABC has done no favors for Sawyer and Donaldson. But who knows? Perhaps their 
time has come. . . . STEVEN LINAN

I'd like to thank CBS for its wonderful documentary, "The Moon Above, the Earth 
Below." The program's computer simulations were informative while Dan Rather 
and Charles Kuralt are also to be commended for their fine commentary. This is 
the type of programming that we need to see more often.

ON THE RECORD: KARAJAN: IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent death of conductor Herbert von Karajan ended a recording career that 
spanned a full half-century -- exceeded in duration only by that of Leopold 
Stokowski. Quantitatively, Karajan was -- and is likely to remain -- in a class 
by himself, having made an estimated 800 recordings, with sales of 150 million 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
He recorded at least a bit of nearly everything including, forgettably, the 
Baroque staples. But while one reads over and over of a primary identification 
with the core 19th-Century symphonic repertory of Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, 
Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Bruckner and Richard Strauss, listeners who grew up in 
the 1950s associate the name of Karajan above all with opera. It is in that 
field that he may well have made his most enduring contributions to 
discographic history. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the following mid-1950s trio from EMI/Angel, studio-made with London's 
magnificently responsive Philharmonia Orchestra, and now on CD: Verdi's 
"Falstaff" (49668, 2 discs) -- Tito Gobbi in the title role -- an 
interpretation of such darting lightness, wit and precision as to put all 
subsequent recorded efforts (including Karajan's remake, c. 1980, for Philips) 
to shame. Then, with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as prima donna, the first commercial 
edition of Richard Strauss' "Ariadne auf Naxos" (69296, 2 CDs), an unbeatable 
combination of suavity and sinew. And the dazzlingly bright "Cosi fan Tutte" of 
Mozart (with whom Karajan would prove increasingly uncomfortable in coming 
years) featuring a dream ensemble including Schwarzkopf, Leopold Simoneau, 
Rolando Panerai and Sesto Bruscantini (69635, 3 CDs). 
</P>
<P>
Indispensable too are a couple of souvenirs of live performances: the 
shatteringly intense 1956 Berlin "Lucia di Lammermoor," with Callas, di 
Stefano, Panerai (available on several different labels), and the white-hot 
1962 Salzburg Festival "Trovatore," with Price, Corelli, Simionato and 
Bastianini (Price-Less 20791, 2 CDs). 
</P>
<P>
These opera recordings disclose an incisiveness, an ear for dramatic pacing and 
just balances that would in subsequent decades give way to an obsessive desire 
for thickly textured, rhythmically sluggish washes of sound, irrespective of a 
specific score's requirements. This soggy aural picture begins to assert itself 
in Karajan's mannered Wagner "Ring," made between 1967 and 1972, now available 
on a mass of Deutsche Grammophon CDs. 
</P>
<P>
Better to recall the Karajan of the keen rhythmic edge and crystalline sonority 
or, broadly, treatment of the composer as an individual rather than as a 
reflection of the conductor's ego. Cherishable examples -- and there are some 
from the later years -- include a grand and stormy 1959 Brahms Fourth Symphony, 
with the Philharmonia Orchestra (EMI/Angel 69228); the searing 1985 Vienna 
Philharmonic Tchaikovsky Fourth Symphony (Deutsche Grammophon 415 348); 
hypnotically mysterious Sibelius, the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, from the 
late '70s with the Berlin Phil (EMI/Angel 69244). 
</P>
<P>
To these should be added the somber but unfailingly mobile Berlin '69 Prokofiev 
Fifth Symphony (DG 423 216); the sumptuous coupling (on EMI/Angel 69242) of 
Hindemith's "Mathis der Maler" Symphony and the Bartok "Music for Strings, 
Percussion and Celesta" dating from the late-1950s; and the noble yet taut 1965 
Brahms "German Requiem" (DG 427 252), the second of his four recordings of that 
work. 
</P>
<P>
With his career so exhaustively documented by the microphones at every stage of 
its unfolding, certain scores were done over and over again, giving Karajan the 
opportunity to refine the life out of them. To cite the most obvious example, 
he recorded the Beethoven symphonies so often -- the entire cycle at least five 
times -- that only the most manic comparison shopper is able to keep them 
straight, or to care. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahms symphonies approach this sort of death by multiplication as well, as 
do select works by Dvorak, Schubert and Richard Strauss. 
</P>
<P>
Karajan achieved some of his finest latter-years work with repertory new to 
him. For instance, the Mahler Sixth and Ninth symphonies (DG 415 099 and 417 
726, respectively, 2 CDs each), both dating from his last decade and both 
combining spontaneity with depth of expression. Remarkable too are the warmth 
and vigorousness of his 1979 recordings of the first three Tchaikovsky 
symphonies (DG, various packagings). 
</P>
<P>
Karajan was, in his later productions, noted for manipulating singers to 
conform to his vision of opera as basically an orchestral form. If he did not 
go quite so far with his instrumental soloists, their individuality was 
nonetheless more often than not subordinated to his will. 
</P>
<P>
Yet on one occasion he was confronted with talent so intimidating that he had 
no choice but to become part of an ensemble, joining Sviatoslav Richter, David 
Oistrakh and Mstislav Rostropovitch to create the monumental 1969 version of 
Beethoven's Triple Concerto (EMI/Angel 69032). 
</P>
<P>
At other -- equally distant -- times less glamorous associations produced 
felicitous results, such as Karajan's DG teaming with the late Christian Ferras 
in the violin concertos of Sibelius (419871) and Tchaikovsky (423 224). 
</P>
<P>
And, as further evidence of the humanity suspected to be lurking behind that 
parched-leather face, imperiously eyeing us from countless record jackets, try 
the Offenbach overtures supermaestro did, ever so lithely and insinuatingly, 
with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1981 (DG 400 044).

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: PERLMAN, CLOSE TO HOST OVATION AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Itzhak Perlman and Glenn Close will host the third annual Ovation Awards -- 
honoring current recordings of classical music and the performers who make them 
-- at Carnegie Hall in New York City Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
The awards show will be taped for later broadcast on radio and television, 
according to Sharon Dec, coordinator of the awards for Ovation magazine. In 
1988, the awards program was shown on cable (Arts &amp; Entertainment). This 
year, Dec says, the management is seeking sponsors for network distribution. 
</P>
<P>
With awards scheduled in 14 categories, voting by a 250-member panel made up of 
music professionals and Ovation readers, begins this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The voting, in a window of time between Saturday and Aug. 15," says Dec, "is 
by a computerized telephone system. The voters have an access code as a group, 
and each one has another, individual access code. After each participant has 
voted, the separate code will be destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
The voters fall into two groups. The first, which Dec refers to as the 
"credentialed group," comprises 125 professionals -- music critics from 
newspapers and magazines, professional record buyers from retail outlets and 
program directors from classical music radio stations. This group's votes are 
"weighted two to one," Dec says, against the votes of the second group of 125 
music-lovers who are subscribers to Ovation magazine. 
</P>
<P>
None of the names of the voters can be revealed, another spokesman for the 
awards show told The Times last week. This in accordance with the rules laid 
down by the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, which will tabulate the 
results and keep them secret until the Oct. 26 event. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination procedure, according to Dec, was this: More than 55 record 
companies submitted more than 300 recordings for consideration. A panel of six 
judges from the national music community -- Robert Conrad, Dave Conant, Israel 
Horowitz, Denise Pineau, Paul Turok and John von Rhein -- listened to these 
recordings and submitted their rankings. From these, the list of competitors in 
14 categories was made up. 
</P>
<P>
What each of the 14 winners -- plus 11 recipients of special, uncategorized 
awards -- will take home is a silver sculpture designed by Vivianne Bulow-Hube 
of Georg Jensen Silversmiths.

POP EYE: MOTOWN ON THE ROAD TO A COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Motown Records was sold a year ago to MCA Records and the investment group 
Boston Ventures, the legendary black music company was struggling. Many of its 
mainstays had left for other record companies, and Motown had had little 
success in developing new acts to take their place. 
</P>
<P>
What difference has a year made? A lot, according to leaders of the local black 
radio community. The company is still nowhere near where it was in its heyday 
in the '60s and '70s, they say, but has laid a solid foundation for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years ago there was no hope and it was really sad," said Cliff 
Winston, program director of KJLH-FM, Los Angeles' top-rated station with a 
black music format. "A Motown record would come in and you'd want to play it; 
you'd want to support black business, but radio is a business too and you have 
to play the hits." 
</P>
<P>
And now? "It has a lot more credibility," Winston said. "It's like a new 
company." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Patterson, program director of KDAY-AM, the No. 2 black music station in 
the market, added: "I think they've made a lot of progress. I don't think 
they've quite turned the corner, but I think they've made quantum leaps. The 
whole attitude at the company is very positive. There's a a definite 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
In the year since the sale, Motown has landed three No. 1 hits on Billboard 
magazine's black singles chart -- more than it had in the previous two years 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
The most encouraging sign from Motown's vantage point: All three hits were 
recorded by new artists. Two were by the Boys, a teen quartet from Compton that 
shows signs of the broad appeal of the Jackson 5; the other is by Today, a 
quartet from New York. 
</P>
<P>
But Motown has also had some big disappointments, notably the lackluster 
showing of Diana Ross' first album since returning to the company following an 
up-and-down six-year stint on RCA Records. The album, "Workin' Overtime," 
stalled at No. 116 on the pop album chart -- Ross' worst showing in more than 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
And few of the R&amp;B hits have crossed over to the broader pop market. The 
label has landed just one Top 40 pop hit in the past year, the Boys' "Dial My 
Heart." 
</P>
<P>
Motown's president and CEO Jheryl Busby said that the company made a conscious 
decision to restore its credibility at its base -- with programmers of 
black-formatted stations and with black audiences -- before pursuing the pop 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing we didn't want to get caught short of in our initial year was 
developing a solid profile with black radio," Busby said. "We feel the pop 
success will come." 
</P>
<P>
Busby, who was previously president of MCA's black music division, added that 
Motown is planning to hire its own pop promotion staff. The original plan 
called for Motown to promote its records at black radio stations and then to 
step back and let MCA attempt to cross them over to pop stations. 
</P>
<P>
"By design it looked great, but it was part of the plan that didn't work," said 
Busby. "One of the things we learned is that there is a need to develop your 
own pop staff." 
</P>
<P>
Busby said that Motown hasn't given up on Ross' album -- the first of a 
seven-album deal. "We haven't even started," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Diana and the company made a conscious decision to go after a youthful, black 
marketplace with the lead single and video," he said. "The follow-up singles 
will have more appeal for other segments of the market. It's a step-by-step 
process in re-establishing an identity." 
</P>
<P>
The company's roster now consists of 46 acts, just 14 of which were inherited 
from the presale Motown. The new signings include two veterans: Ray Charles and 
the Pointer Sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Busby said that he is pleased with the company's progress in the past year, but 
noted that some things have taken longer than he thought they would. "We had to 
hire a staff, sign artists and develop systems and operating procedures. I 
underestimated how long that process would take. We really haven't gotten a lot 
of our signings into the marketplace yet. They'll be a big part of our third 
and fourth quarters." 
</P>
<P>
The radio programmers said that in evaluating Motown's progress, it's important 
to remember how poorly it had fared in the last few years before the sale. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand how bad it had gotten to judge how far they've come 
back," said KJLH's Winston. "Toward the end there before the changeover, it was 
pretty bleak. The product was very spotty. Now it's very strong." 
</P>
<P>
Added KDAY's Patterson: "Before, a lot of their acts were weak and the music 
was pretty weak. They were way behind -- and they were falling behind more and 
more. Motown represents the dreams and aspirations of a big chunk of black 
America. They rewrote musical history, and to see that position erode before 
your eyes was kind of sad, like Muhammad Ali in the last couple of years."

Two influential mainstays of L.A.'s rock underground are making fresh starts. 
Steve Wynn has broken up the Dream Syndicate in favor of solo activities, while 
Chris D. -- former frontman of the Flesheaters and Divine Horsemen -- has just 
released the debut album of his new group, Stone by Stone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting, but also frightening," said Wynn, who despite his lengthy track 
record is still only 29. 
</P>
<P>
"That's good, though. It's something I respond to. This was something I was 
thinking about doing for the last several years, but the Dream Syndicate was 
real safe for me. I was keeping the name for safety, but from the time I've 
been in music it was never meant to be safe. Using it for safety was going 
against the whole point." 
</P>
<P>
Wynn expects his solo debut, for which he is currently shopping labels and 
producers, will reflect considerable change in attitude and cultural climate. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot easier to be shocking and radical seven or eight years ago," he 
said. "I think the pose and pretense was almost as important as the music then. 
Now it's more audacious to be naked and human and say something without hedging 
your bets." 
</P>
<P>
Dream Syndicate fans can get one last memento: Restless has just released "Live 
at Raji's," a strong live collection recorded last year at the Hollywood club 
by former Neil Young producer Elliot Mazer. 
</P>
<P>
For Chris D., 36, Stone by Stone not only is the name of his new band, but a 
description of the process by which he is rebuilding his multifaceted career. 
He's been relatively dormant since the unexpected 1987 breakup of Divine 
Horsemen, which was precipitated by a split with his wife and musical partner, 
Julie Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first year after Julie and I split, I kind of crawled into a hole," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he has resumed not only his musical activities with the album "I Pass for 
Human," but also his pursuits in the literary and acting fields. "Double Snake 
Bourbon," a book of poetry and lyrics, is set for publication by Illiterati 
Press in the fall, and he's shopping for publishers for two completed novels. 
</P>
<P>
As for screen activity, D., who had a featured bad-guy part in the 1987 Kevin 
Costner spy thriller "No Way Out" and starred in "Border Radio," will star in 
"Lines," a short film based on a Joe Frank radio monologue. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the music goes, I could continue indefinitely on a cult level, 
getting bands together and going on the road," he said. "But I would always 
come back to not having an apartment or having income that would help me out. 
At this point, do I want to do that when I have a desire for security and a 
desire to have a family?" 
</P>
<P>
CLUB COURT: A judge's preliminary decision in the fight over ownership of the 
Anticlub's name has left the conflict unresolved. Both Helen Guttman, who owns 
the Melrose Avenue club that has been doing business as the Anticlub since 
1979, and the partnership of Russell Jessum, Jack Marquette and Jim Van Tyne, 
which claims to have used the name as early as 1977 before bringing it to 
Guttman's facility, are allowed to use the name. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a recent press release, Jessum, Marquette and Van Tyne in essence 
relinquished the name, stating that "we no longer wish to use a name that has . 
. . come to represent 'pay-to-play' bookings and rude management." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to that, Guttman told L.A. Beat that "Russell was like one of my 
kids" when he began booking shows at her club. 
</P>
<P>
According to Marquette, who now books Al's Bar, an appeal is possible, but not 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dead issue at this point," he said. "Most people around town know the 
Anticlub isn't what it was before." 
</P>
<P>
HECK NAY, WE WON'T PAY: Another club has come out against the pay-to-play 
policy that is stifling the local rock scene, as the Central has instituted a 
regular "five bands for five bucks" show for Sundays, with local hard-rock acts 
not having to put up a playing fee. The events are being run by Roy McMillan's 
Dynamic Productions, a concert and management company with a 25-year history 
that includes early projects by Van Halen and Quiet Riot. Tonight'slineup 
includes the Hardtops, the Roger Wynfield Band, Feeliacs and Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the pay-to-play front, the Rockers Against Pay to Play (RAPP) 
organization is planning a boycott and picketing of pay-to-play clubs the first 
weekend in September. 
</P>
<P>
BUZZWORDS: Dramarama has signed with Chameleon Records. "Stuck in 
Wonderamaland," the band's follow-up to 1987's KROQ fave "Box Office Bomb," is 
due out next month. Along with a host of new original songs, the band pays 
tribute to idol Ian Hunter with a version of Mott the Hoople's "I Wish I Was 
Your Mother." That song is also the B-side of the band's current European 
single of "Anything Anything," drawn from the score of "A Nightmare on Elm 
Street, 4" (or "Le Cauchemar de Freddy," as it says on the French record 
sleeve). . . . 
</P>
<P>
David Swanson -- who fronted the Pop, one of L.A.'s strongest bands from the 
skinny-tie era -- has signed to RCA, with a solo album in the works. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The 7th Day club is floating again after a brief association with the 8121 
club. The organization is sponsoring a reading by author Hubert Selby Jr. and 
poet Iris Berry tonight at the Shamrock Cafe, 4600 Hollywood Blvd., from 6 to 9 
p.m. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Harvey &amp; the Lifers have released an eight-song cassette titled "Not Fading 
Away." The band will be at the Gaslight in Hollywood on Aug. 11 and at the 
Sunset in Sierra Madre on Aug. 17. . . .

'PAY FOR PLAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This open letter to "pay to play" promoters is prompted by Chuck Philips' July 
16 article on clubs extracting fees from bands that want to gain exposure by 
performing on their stages: 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to thank all you promoters for finally figuring out a way to foul up 
everyone: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The bands that will have to scrape up the money to be heard and will 
probably bomb out because they haven't yet developed as performing groups. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The clubs, whose names will mean nothing in terms of promotion because 
anyone can pay to be on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The record companies, which will have a far more meager bunch of bands to 
choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The record buyer, who will have little but slick commercial garbage to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And last, yourselves; you will have to live with your "product" . . . or 
else listen perpetually to oldies, which, as you know, get very old.

'PAY FOR PLAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the increasing attention to the "pay to play" virus, it's becoming 
increasingly frustrating to read of club owners griping about barely making 
ends meet and thus justifying the practice. 
</P>
<P>
The problem lies with the clubs' refusal to have one in-house booker; use of a 
single booker would end the need for outside promoters, who are, for the most 
part, the greatest perpetrators of the pay-to-play evil. 
</P>
<P>
Clubs in areas such as Anaheim, San Pedro and Reseda survive because they use 
one booker and do their own advertising, along with some pre-sales.

<TEXT>
<P>
In his article, "Behind the High Cost of L.A.'s Rock Dreams," Philips writes 
that rock musician Mark Mason "received encouragement" from members of the rock 
group Kiss in his campaign against pay for play. This is interesting, because 
on their way up Kiss applied the pay-for-play methodology themselves when 
renting halls and even limos to showcase their act. 
</P>
<P>
Kiss was an original band with enough guts and savvy to invest in themselves, 
even if it meant starving for a while. To expect club owners to front the bill 
for a mass of bands who all look and sound alike is not only unrealistic but 
unfair. 
</P>
<P>
If a band has talent, originality and confidence, nothing is going to stop it, 
even if it has to pay its dues to play the game.

BILLY AND ROB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The superficiality of Hollywood continually amazes me. Gregg Kilday writes at 
length about the close friendship between Billy Crystal and Rob Reiner, about 
their special bond, in his July 16 article, "When Billy Met Rob." 
</P>
<P>
The article then discusses why it took director Reiner so long to cast Crystal 
in his new picture, "When Harry Met Sally. . . ." After balking at script 
changes requested by Richard Dreyfuss, whom Reiner wanted for the role, and 
"after considering a long list of actors, (Reiner) finally made the call to 
Crystal." 
</P>
<P>
Crystal is quoted as saying that Reiner told him: "I had to see everybody, I 
had to go through the process just to make sure you're the perfect guy." 
</P>
<P>
Good friends don't snowjob each other like that. Hollywood is a place for 
business, but for special friendships . . . I don't think so.

A RAP FLAP AMID ANTI-SEMITISM CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reaction to Steve Hochman's July 16 article about Public Enemy, the rap group 
that announced it was disbanding after a group member created a controversy by 
saying in an interview, "The Jews are wicked. We can prove that": 
</P>
<P>
We have almost completed a decade filled with hatred, violence and racial 
contempt, as witnessed by several alarming incidents. Among them are the Al 
Campanis blunder on national TV; the emergence of Louis Farrakhan; the 
resurgence of white supremacist movements; the escalation of gang warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is anti-Semitic sentiment from Public Enemy and what appears to be a 
racially motivated movie by Spike Lee ("Do the Right Thing"), which I consider 
incendiary. 
</P>
<P>
What has become of the '60s movement that included a cause for civil rights? 
And what about the '70s, which saw a push for equality in many areas? 
</P>
<P>
Apparently we have not come far. Or maybe we have just come full circle, back 
around again to a time of prejudice as we head into the '90s. In any case, I am 
saddened by the attacks on people in regard to the color of their skin, the 
colors of their clothes or the way they pray to God.

Prof. Griff, the Public Enemy member whose statements caused a furor, is

Griff may be making racist comments, but unless he starts beating up people or

Public Enemy encourages black youths like me (I'm 17) to learn about their 
history. They teach black kids about their leaders, Minister Farrakhan, Jesse 
Jackson and Malcolm X -- something the public school system does not do. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior project, I wrote a history of rap music. I interviewed Chuck D of 
Public Enemy. He is a great person, and black youths need him. 
</P>

All races need to listen to Public Enemy. They are showing other races how 
blacks feel.

Regarding the July 23 story, "The Incredible Shrinking PC": 
</P>
<P>
If the Times is correct, and "big and bulky" machines are going to give way to 
hand-held itty-bitty pocket computers, World War III is about to be launched in 
some American homes. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, too many American men leave for work at dawn and do not return until 
dusk. The only reason these workaholics do not work after dinner is that their 
computer is back at the office. Now, Mr. Wirk Aholik will finish his coffee and 
dessert, kiss his wife's cheek, and depart to the den. There he will turn to 
his favorite TV sportscast to achieve the sufficient level of noise needed for 
him to work with his HC (hand computer). 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists tell us that relationships between men and women are made more 
difficult by the absence of intimacy between partners. Imagine trying to be 
intimate while he stares into his hand! But for the woman who hates her husband 
reading in bed (flipping those pages keeps her awake), cheer up. Now, she can 
be lulled to sleep by an HC beep. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps we'd better import some romantic types from Italy or France or even the 
Soviet Union. Those men are not accustomed to working so much, and I think a 
few of us are going to need some diversion.

JAPAN: ANGST WASHES OVER THE NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

University School of Business and a senior fellow at the Center for the New 
West.

<TEXT>
<P>
Last week's stunning defeat of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party tapped a 
deep-seated, growing discontent in the island nation. After four decades of 
political stability and economic ascendancy, the Japanese seem to be losing 
faith in their nation's system and its prospects for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Political disaffection, evident from last week's voting, represents one major 
element in this rising tide of Asiatic angst. Through corruption, arrogance and 
insensitivity, the Liberal Democrats alienated a majority of voters. Yet there 
seems only limited enthusiasm for the victorious opposition, particularly the 
Socialists, who few believe capable of running the government. 
</P>
<P>
With the ruling party discredited and the opposition lacking stature, the real 
loser may be the Japanese political system itself. "We are at the edge of 
Niagara Falls," warned Jiro Tokuyama, one of Japan's foremost economic thinkers 
and a longtime adviser to the LDP leadership. "We are good at dealing with 
outside crisis -- the oil shock of the 1970s or the yen revaluation today -- 
but now the collapse is coming from inside." 
</P>
<P>
A pervading sense of "collapse" goes beyond politics. The scandal embroiling 
top business and political figures with the Recruit Cosmos Co. -- precipitating 
the current crisis -- only confirmed a mounting, broader disquiet about Japan's 
much- admired economic system and those who inhabit its highest circles. 
</P>
<P>
In the decades after World War II, economist Hiroshi Takeuchi noted that the 
most prominent business figures were often industrial entrepreneurs, such as 
Soichiro Honda and Akio Morita, men whose personal accomplishments were admired 
and seen as beneficial to the nation as a whole. Today, Takeuchi sees much of 
the big money coming from real estate and stock speculation, activities that 
engender little admiration from the average middle-class Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"Our national culture is being eroded," said Takeuchi. "Our values, our belief 
in hard work and industry, are falling apart. Those who work the hardest get 
the least. That undermines everything." 
</P>
<P>
Even more frustrating, as the rentier class has grown almost obscenely rich, 
the quality of life for the average Japanese salariman, or white-collar worker, 
has stayed the same or even worsened. Despite the image of Japan as a rich, 
successful country, many Japanese increasingly wonder if the economic system 
still works for them. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers, for instance, have barely benefited from the rapid rise of the yen 
over the last few years. Prices for imported food and manufactured goods should 
have gone down markedly; they did no such thing -- due largely to a politically 
fixed and inefficient distribution system. A cup of coffee still costs three 
times as much in Tokyo as in Los Angeles. Small wonder Japanese voters reacted 
with such vehemence against the ruling party's consumption tax that added 3% to 
virtually every necessity. 
</P>
<P>
The housing situation is even worse. As trade surpluses increased the supply of 
money, land prices soared to three or four times U.S. levels for residential 
real estate -- and about 30 times higher for industrial land. The dream of 
owning a small house in the suburbs -- with a 90-minute commute to town on a 
crowded train -- is slipping away for all but the wealthiest Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Recent polls show the level of satisfaction among Japanese -- in terms of food, 
shelter and general quality of life -- has been dropping since the mid-1980s. 
For the average salariman, the quality of life, according to Long-Term Credit 
Bank estimates, remains at levels roughly half those enjoyed in the United 
States, West Germany and other advanced nations. "Everyone is beginning to 
realize that the trade surpluses have not helped our lives at all," said 
Takeuchi. 
</P>
<P>
Recent polls indicate that less than 20% of the Japanese believe life will 
improve in the years ahead. This negativity about the future stems from a 
variety of perceived threats, ranging from economic causes to more generalized 
concerns such as the environment or social decay. "What is selling now in the 
stores is anxiety," said one of Japan's leading booksellers. "There is 
tremendous sense that this so-called prosperity is a temporary thing. In three 
years, five years maybe, the bubble will burst." 
</P>
<P>
The new generation seems particularly affected by such pessimism. Unlike their 
parents, so often willing to sacrifice personal needs for the good of country 
and company, many young adults adopt nihilistic attitudes not so unlike the "I 
want it now" of 1980s America. Many of Japan's best and brightest now think 
more about making a quick buck than boosting Japan's economic or technological 
prowess. 
</P>
<P>
This year, for example, roughly half the graduating computer scientists at 
Tokyo University opted for careers in banking and insurance, largely because 
those fields now pay up to 50% more than industrial companies. "We are moving 
from an industrial culture to a money-flow culture," said Tosiyasu L. Kunii, 
chairman of the university's computer science program. "We are seeing all the 
worst of the American corruptions." 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States suffers many similar problems, Kunii points out that 
America retains key assets lacking in Japan, such as immigration of foreign 
professionals and a buoyant entrepreneurial sector. As a result, he doubts his 
nation will ever surpass the United States in technological innovation. 
</P>
<P>
With a lack of new immigrants and a falling birthrate, Japan is rapidly aging, 
its percentage of elderly projected to be more than double that of the United 
States by the year 2000. For the current generation of baby boomers, this means 
dealing with huge costs of care for the elderly and a declining pool of younger 
workers to supervise, sharply limiting opportunities for advancement. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of upward mobility contributes to an alienated business class. A recent 
poll of executives in their 40s, found more than a majority dissatisfied with 
their jobs. The sense of mission that characterized earlier generations has 
been replaced by a sense of ennui. 
</P>
<P>
None of this suggests that Japan will fade as a major world power in the 
decades ahead. Americans, Soviets and Western Europeans face equally profound 
if divergent crises of confidence and self-image. The difference is that Japan 
-- long a model of unparalleled success -- can no longer avoid the angst 
afflicting other leading nations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a couple of years, it was the traditional state of affairs: Poles on each 
side being maximalists in politics, as in war and romance, demanding 
everything, offering nothing, eschewing compromise and practicing the "politics 
of the worst," hoping the other side would commit catastrophic errors even if 
the whole society suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years of communism had created hostilities so deep that the nation seemed 
doomed to suicidal stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
No longer. Sunday, June 4, 1989, is the date that will live in the history of 
postwar communism. That was the day when the first relatively free Polish 
elections in 42 years were held -- with Solidarity candidates demolishing what 
was left of the ruling Communist Party's credibility. That same day, across the 
globe on Tien An Men Square, Chinese army tanks and machine guns made a blood 
bath of the rising pro-democracy movement . 
</P>
<P>
In historical perspective, those Polish and Chinese events must be seen as the 
dawn of a new era. 
</P>
<P>
For Poland, the election results mark the end of four decades of unquestioned 
communist domination. 
</P>
<P>
For China, the Beijing massacre represents a tragic chapter in the struggle for 
political freedoms, in the same sense Solidarity's brutal but not bloody 1981 
suppression by the Polish army was part of the change culminating in its 
electoral triumph 7 1/2 years later. China is by no means a freeze-frame. 
</P>
<P>
Poland attained what seemed wholly implausible even in the mid-1980s: the 
peaceful emergence of a pluralistic society and a full range of political 
liberties in a communist-controlled nation. In the Soviet Union, reform forces 
are strong in the new Legislature but the Communist Party itself is not yet 
being challenged. Poland is an unprecedented phenomenon in Marxist-Leninist 
annals. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the evolution away from communism should not come as a total surprise, 
either to those who have watched the unfolding Polish situation or to those who 
were not wedded to the conventional Washington wisdom that gradual change 
toward freedom in a communist system is an impossible oxymoron. 
</P>
<P>
My experiences in Poland as far back as 1987 (two years is a long time in the 
breathless political metamorphosis) bear out the proposition that elementary 
logic had to bring together the communist regime and the democratic opposition 
if the nation were to be saved from utter collapse, economic and social. The 
best brains in both camps had come, however reluctantly, to recognize this 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 at Gdansk, Lech Walesa, the chief of the then-illegal but enormously 
popular Solidarity movement, was already predicting, "Sooner or later, we shall 
meet with Jaruzelski on the way to reform." Though the government increasingly 
tolerated Solidarity's activities, I was surprised that Walesa was prepared to 
deal with Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist Party chief who tried to 
liquidate Solidarity and who kept Walesa virtually imprisoned for nearly two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, moreover, expressed no bitterness; in fact, he seemed to have 
considerable respect for Jaruzelski, certainly not regarding him -- unlike many 
other Poles -- as a Soviet stooge. Seeing Walesa for the first time since 
Solidarity's heyday in 1981, he seemed much more mature politically, more 
realistic and more moderate than I had expected a victim of Jaruzelski's regime 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that he had lost control of Solidarity's "radical wing" during 
confrontations with the government; he implied that moderation was the only way 
to keep Poland a viable country. 
</P>
<P>
A separate conversation with historian Bronislaw Geremek, Walesa's most trusted 
political strategist (now Solidarity's Parliamentary leader in the Sejm, the 
lower house), convinced me that the Polish opposition had begun to think 
compromise was the bridge toward a peaceful fade-out of communist supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
Next, I had a two-hour private chat in Warsaw with the general himself. I had 
first talked to Jaruzelski in 1982, six months after he imposed martial law in 
order to crush Solidarity. He began by telling me, "We have all changed and we 
have all learned a lot," and he had fairly kind words for what he called "the 
moderate opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Other conversations with members of Jaruzelski's entourage further suggested 
that some form of cooperation among rival groups was recognized as vital, and 
that the young generation in the Communist Party favored it as well. 
</P>
<P>
But, as usually occurs in such situations, moderates on both sides -- Walesa 
and Geremek among the opposition, Jaruzelski and his allies in the fragile 
regime -- had to persuade their respective constituencies that compromise was 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition moderates had to maneuver carefully to retain the support of 
confrontation-minded foes of the regime, "the children of Solidarity." Some 
young activists abhored any dealing with the government and even suspected the 
Roman Catholic Church of collaborationism. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski had support from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev who, unlike 
Leonid I. Brezhnev, approved of Polish reform alongside his own perestroika, 
but the general had to fight Polish hard-liners who consistently sabotaged 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread wildcat industrial strikes during 1988 -- deplored by the regime, 
also deplored by Walesa who risked his popularity by insisting that workers 
return to their jobs -- loosened the national paralysis. In the past, strikes 
triggered new confrontations; this time they helped pave the way to an 
understanding. A new phase opened early this year as regime leaders and 
moderate opposition leaders finally determined to meet halfway. 
</P>
<P>
The rest is history. The government and the moderate opposition spent long 
weeks negotiating -- itself a giant leap forward -- to produce amazing 
breakthroughs. Jaruzelski and his principal advisers agreed to re-legalize 
Solidarity and to allow a free press, in exchange for opposition commitment not 
to challenge the nominal sway of the Communist Party and to support its 
presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Even more spectacular was the agreement on direct elections for 35% of seats in 
the Sejm (Solidarity agreed to let the Communists have a strong majority) and 
for all 100 seats in a Senate that was being restored as the upper house for 
the first time since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
When I saw Geremek in Washington just before the June elections, we reminisced 
about our Warsaw chats two years earlier, marveling at how quickly things had 
progressed. But he did not expect the landslide that awarded Solidarity and 
other opponents 99 Senate seats and all the Sejm seats allotted to them. 
</P>
<P>
Stunning as it was to see these results, with Jaruzelski and Walesa together on 
a bench at the Sejm inaugural session (inasmuch as neither ran for Parliament), 
Solidarity's next gesture of statesmanship was even more extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
Aware that a combination of opposition radicals and communist hard-liners had 
the power to prevent Jaruzelski's election to the presidency, Geremek and 
Senate Speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski manipulated the parliamentary voting to 
assure his victory on July 19 -- by one ballot. Incredibly, Solidarity handed 
power to the man who once tried to destroy it, because the general was the most 
promising choice and his defeat could unravel the entire compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The next historic chapter has begun. With a $39-billion foreign debt, shattered 
infrastructure and runaway inflation, Poles must now decide how to run the 
country, realizing that Western aid cannot perform miracles. Jaruzelski would 
like the opposition to join a coalition government, another Polish communist 
"first." As of last week Solidarity flatly refused, holding out for a 
full-fledged Solidarity government with its own premier. Maximalizing may not 
be entirely dead. Yet the Poles have crossed a Rubicon: For the first time in 
half a century, destiny is in their own hands.

The front-page articles of July 17, "Summit Stresses Ecological Threat" and, 
July 18, "Lujan to Defend Offshore Oil Drilling as Vital" make one wonder if 
members of the Administration are in touch with one another, let alone the rest

LET PEOPLE CHOOSE

<TEXT>
<P>
As a character in a recent popular novel observed: There are things that are 
necessary evils, and there are things that are more evil than necessary. In a 
free society, tolerance of offensive speech is one of those necessary evils, 
particularly when that speech involves the expression of political or artistic 
ideas. In fact, when it comes to those two areas of speech, it can be said that 
the moral dichotomy between freedom and license is a distinction without a 
difference. Similarly, the evils engendered by censorship nearly always 
outstrip the imagined necessity. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the controversy over congressional funding of the National Endowment 
for the Arts, which gives money to public institutions such as symphony 
orchestras, theaters and art museums. Not long ago, a few senators and 
congressmen discovered that the endowment had helped finance a retrospective of 
photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, some of whose images have homoerotic 
themes, and a group exhibit including photos by Andres Serrano, whose pictures 
depict the abuse of religious icons. This is distasteful stuff, which quickly 
would have dropped from view had it not been seized upon by a little band of 
opportunists. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the House simply slapped the endowment with a token cut in its budget. 
In the Senate, however, Jesse Helms (R.-N.C.) induced his colleagues to approve 
a measure that would deny federal money to the two institutions that mounted 
the controversial shows. It also would prohibit use of federal funds to 
"promote. . .obscene or indecent materials . . .or material which denigrates 
the objects or beliefs of the adherents of a particular religion or 
nonreligion." 
</P>
<P>
Putting aside the fact that Helms' blacklisting of two organizations looks like 
an illegal bill of attainder, his proposed limitations on speech are so broad 
that their imposition would be not only unconstitutional, but also laughable. 
Public television, for example, could not have aired the acclaimed production 
of "Brideshead Revisited," Evelyn Waugh's masterpiece of Christian redemption, 
since it depicts a homosexual affair. No federal funds could be used to stage a 
public reading of Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses," nor, for that matter, 
of James Joyce's "Ulysses." Atheists could challenge museums' use of federal 
money to acquire old master paintings with religious themes. 
</P>
<P>
The House and Senate versions of the National Endowment's appropriation now 
will go to a conference committee for reconciliation. Sober lawmakers will see 
the choice for what it is: Either Congress will preserve the people's right to 
choose for themselves what art they will see or that choice will be made for 
them by a bargain-basement Savonarola.

TIME TO REASSESS AFGHAN AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it in the interests of the United State to continue sending a lot of 
military aid to anti-government guerrilla forces in Afghanistan? More to the 
point, is it in the interests of the Afghan people, who increasingly seem to be 
the victims rather than the beneficiaries of actions by the insurgent 
moujahedeen? The State Department, over objections from some defense and 
intelligence analysts, wants to go on giving arms to the guerrillas, for years 
to come if need be, and that view seems to have prevailed within the Bush 
Administration. Left unexplained is just what goal this expensive program is 
intended to serve. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the 1980s, U.S. policy in Afghanistan had a clear purpose. Through 
clandestine arms shipments, it first of all aimed at keeping the invading 
Soviet army from occupying the whole country and then at making the cost of 
just holding on so high that the Soviets would decide to bring their forces 
home. The policy worked. The Russians are gone, leaving behind a pro-Soviet 
regime that controls little more than a few large urban areas. Confounding the 
predictions of some American experts, though, the regime has managed to 
survive, not least of all because the tribal-based moujahedeen remain unable to 
put aside their traditional suspicions and rivalries and cooperate on a 
coherent military strategy to bring down the Kabul government. 
</P>
<P>
The best the insurgents have been able to do is put the cities of Jalalabad and 
Kabul under siege. But heavy shelling and blockades have so far done little but 
kill hundreds of mainly innocent civilians and threaten hundreds of thousands 
more with a loss of food supplies. The regime itself hasn't been discernibly 
weakened. Meanwhile, though, there are signs of growing public mistrust of the 
moujahedeen, who remain as far from political unity and as mutually suspicious 
as ever. 
</P>
<P>
To continue to shower the moujahedeen with weapons and so to encourage the 
tactics they have adopted comes perilously close to endorsing actions that 
promote deliberate mass starvation. That is not what American efforts in 
Afghanistan have been all about. Instead of just doing more of what it has been 
doing for the last seven or eight years, the United States should be rethinking 
what its ultimate goals in Afghanistan are, and asking whether the crude 
tactics and apparently incurable political divisiveness of the moujahe-deen are 
the most promising means for getting there.

'THE GREENING OF THE SUMMIT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The summit meeting of industrialized nations is now history -- if that isn't 
too dignified a word for it. About all it accomplished was to keep the visiting 
participants out of mischief in their home countries, but now they must return 
to their scandals, deficits and broken promises. The strained harmony of the 
formal sessions did not quite hide the sound of trade knives being sharpened 
under the table, and the after-hours schoolyard squabbling was ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher chided the French because Napoleon 
once tried to unify Europe by force -- she didn't mention what the British were 
doing in India at that time. Nor did she address her own government's shabby 
treatment of the residents of Hong Kong and the Vietnamese boat people. 
France's President Francois Mitterrand loftily dismissed the idea of inviting 
Mikhail Gorbachev to the next summit because the Soviet Union is no democracy 
-- that criterion would also disqualify much of the French neocolonial sphere 
of influence. Bush predictably prattled about the virtues of free trade, 
ignoring the increase in U.S. non-tariff barriers during the Reagan-Bush 
administrations, and the "socialism for the rich" bailout of the savings and 
loans. Prime Minister Sosuke Uno of Japan wisely held his peace; he was only 
there because in the party of the larcenous the merely lecherous gets to be the 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, everyone was astonished at Gorbachev's apparent willingness for the West 
to take over his non-performing assets in Eastern Europe, now that Russia has 
milked it dry. Why not? The Warsaw Pact has been an empty shell for years. 
</P>
<P>
The summit fizzled like a damp squib, but the bicentennial fireworks display 
was marvelous. Marie Antoinette would have loved it.

JURY AWARDS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Judge Slashes $5.74-Million Award Against West Covina Police," 
Metro, July 11: 
</P>
<P>
I will never understand how a judge (one person) can justify in any way 
overruling a jury's (12 people) award. 
</P>
<P>
Why not do away with juries altogether in all cases where the judge does 
whatever he wants? In my opinion this is just a joke and disgrace to our 
so-called judicial system, and a clear violation of our civil rights to have a 
jury of our peers decide on the amounts of awards, etc.

HEALTH INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Chamber of Commerce is very concerned about the issue of 
providing health insurance to the over 5.2 million uninsured Californians. 
</P>
<P>
In your editorial ("Deukmejian Gets on Board," July 17) you singled out the 
chamber (specifically) and the business community (in general) for negativism 
on this issue and being absent from consultations and negotiations with the 
Health Access Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
While your editorial accurately described the two major pieces of legislation 
on this topic -- AB 350 by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, which would mandate 
employer-funded health insurance, and AB 328 by Assemblyman Burt Margolin, 
which would create a state insurance plan -- you forgot to mention the major 
impact these solutions will have on small business. 
</P>
<P>
Small business has been the fuel that has kept the engines of California's 
economy moving during the 1980s, by creating nearly 3 million new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Speaker's bill, AB 350, cannot take effect until 1993 due to federal 
preemption problems, why enact this measure now before knowing the economic 
impact? 
</P>
<P>
We have been active in negotiations and we will continue to seek solutions to 
this problem that are affordable by small employers.

ILLEGAL ROADS

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Bulldozers Grind Away Illegally Along the Coast," Part I, July 
17: 
</P>
<P>
I read the piece with shock and dismay. How can such a thing be? Why isn't 
something being done about it? The rape of the land by developers is one of the 
most insidious of all crimes, and yet, it goes virtually unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
Until people regard such crimes as crimes, the developers will continue to rob 
others of their right to a good quality of life. Overdevelopment results in 
traffic congestion, destruction of plant and animal life, and pollution. The 
laws that are already on the books need to be enforced!

POSTSCRIPT TO APOLLO: WASTED YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
NEED TO EXPLORE SPACE REMAINS, REGARDLESS OF NAYSAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM CLANCY, Tom Clancy's next book is Clear and Present Danger (Putnam). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the evening of July 20, the Arts and Entertainment cable television network 
ran the complete coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing and walk. It served 
only to refresh memories that will remain until death. Who can forget that 
night 20 years ago? Who can forget the pride of nationhood? Who can forget the 
excitement and the wonder? 
</P>
<P>
Evidently quite a few people have chosen to do so. The media tell us that 
Woodstock, for example, was far more significant -- despite the fact that more 
Americans traveled to Florida to watch Apollo 11 blast off than to have their 
ears blasted and their minds altered in that muddy New York pasture. 
</P>
<P>
That false impression lingers to this date. It is a routine matter for hundreds 
of thousands of Americans to drive their cars and campers to the causeways near 
Cape Canaveral or the desert flatlands of California to watch the space shuttle 
launch and land. Yet social critics would tell us that the fact that so many 
American citizens make those pilgrimages is less significant than a shrill 
demonstration for some social issue or other -- in which, of course, the media 
has greater interest. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this fact demonstrates the nature of criticism, that its function is 
fundamentally negative, limiting -- and blind. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Johnson's most devastating and immortal observation is that it is within 
the capacity of anyone to do nothing, a fact as true of the 18th Century as it 
is the 20th. How easy it is to speak of the worthlessness of a project, how the 
money might be spent on some present need, how there must be better ways to do 
things, how we have more immediate concerns. It is the sort of vision that 
condemns a society to its present forever instead of leading it to the future 
within its grasp. 
</P>
<P>
It came home to me, watching A&amp;E that night, that the do-nothings have 
almost won. Watching the tapes of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, it came home 
very powerfully indeed that we had wasted 20 complete years. Scarcely had the 
astronauts returned when NASA's funding was slashed, then slashed again. And 
why? To help the poor, of course. "A nation that could go to the moon," carped 
those on the political left who never had any use for Apollo except as a 
counterpoint for their own arguments, could just as easily take all that money 
and solve America's crushing social problems. 
</P>
<P>
Well, they've had their 20 years to solve their social problems. Vast mountains 
of funds have been disposed of, whole new bureaucracies created -- and those 
who made it all happen now say that the problem is worse than ever, that we 
still cannot afford a space program,that a nation that has gone to the moon can 
and ought to solve its social problems first. 
</P>
<P>
It was this sort of vision that made Portugal a world power. 
</P>
<P>
Any decent cynic could observe that if the problems are not solved, then the 
ability of the social reformers to do so is seriously in doubt. An indecent 
critic might say that the War on Poverty was fought with the same skill as that 
other war given us by the Johnson Administration. In either case, deducting a 
few percentage points from 20 years' worth of programs would manifestly have 
had no effect on the unsolved problems at all. 
</P>
<P>
But it would have given America something that the Soviet Union has -- a 
permanent space station where real people could do real work. What might have 
come from such a facility? Who can say? You have to go there to find out. 
</P>
<P>
Exploration is part and parcel of American history. It is said that we ought 
not to go forward with a major space program without assistance from our 
allies. Lewis and Clark, the first great American explorers, traveled a land in 
which our European friends had little interest -- the purchase itself had its 
detractors, of course; one wonders if some of those who opposed the Louisiana 
Purchase had heard Dr. Johnson's dictum firsthand -- and along the way they 
discovered about a third of what we now call America. The bread we eat comes 
from the region that was once called the Great American Desert. Now we call it 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Doubtless there were pressing social problems at the time, but it is 
instructive that those problems are now the subject of dry history, while the 
subject of the purchase and exploration are a living part of our country. 
</P>
<P>
It is a fact of history that those who press outward always bring home 
discoveries that are useful. In simple business terms, investment in the future 
pays better than investment in the past. It is similarly true that you go to 
strange regions not for what you know is there, but for what you do not know. 
That's why it's called exploration. And only people can do that, because only 
people can look about and truly see things. Machines cannot. Exploration means 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The one advantage in exploration that did not exist so much in earlier times is 
that getting there really is half the fun. The space program is the future. It 
really is that simple. The poor may always be with us. Certainly the naysayers 
will. And the future will come whether we like it or not. The question is 
whether or not we will be there to meet and make it. The naysayers have had 
their 20 years, have spent their mountains of funds and have produced slim 
results by their own admission. Isn't it time to give somebody else a chance?

U.S. SOLDIER STANDS GUARD IN A LUXEMBOURG CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CLERVAUX, Luxembourg 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1970s one of the cheapest ways to fly from the United States to 
continental Europe was on Icelandic (now called Icelandair), which landed in 
the tiny country of Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the backpacking, college-age American passengers (I was among them 
on my way to study at a German university), Luxembourg was nothing more than a 
place to transfer from plane to train en route to more alluring cities such as 
Paris, Amsterdam and Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Today, many Americans are again landing in Luxembourg, via Icelandair. Once 
more, I was one of them -- but this time I sought one of the nation's secluded 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to relax, hike through woods and settle slowly into European life. 
Clervaux, which is in the hills of the Ardennes and easily reached within an 
hour by train from the city of Luxembourg, sounded like just the place. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Vianden, another castle town, Clervaux is one of the most 
picturesque villages in the country. 
</P>
<P>
As my train rumbled north from Luxembourg, known as "the City," the rolling 
farmland and pastures of the south soon gave way to the hilly, forested 
Ardennes. 
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg, with only 999 square miles, is roughly two-thirds the size of Rhode 
Island. A third is blanketed with forests in a mountain region shared with 
France, Belgium and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
There are no majestic peaks. The Ardennes is an area of hills pinched close 
together, covered with spruce and pine and laced through with narrow meadows 
and mountain streams. 
</P>
<P>
Glens slide in and out of view, hinting at private and secret places. Villages 
of stone come and go. 
</P>
<P>
The countryside is similar to the country itself -- miniature, hemmed in and 
singularly inviting. 
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg has more hiking trails than it does roads. And with 50 miles of 
marked pathways surrounding it, Clervaux proved perfect for exploring on foot. 
</P>
<P>
A village of 1,000, Clervaux is in a deep and narrow valley beside the River 
Clerve in the midst of the Ardennes, only nine miles from the Belgian border. 
</P>
<P>
It is dominated by an imposing 12th-Century stone castle and a red-roofed 
abbey. But an American flag flies in the town square and a statue of an 
American soldier stands guard. 
</P>
<P>
A plaque reads: "To Our Liberators, 1944-1945." This is, after all, "Battle of 
the Bulge" country. The people of Luxembourg have not forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to get a lot of American visitors, many of them soldiers coming back 
with their families," a Clervaux resident said. "They returned to see how the 
place had changed, or maybe they were looking for a meaning in the hardships 
they went through as young men during the war. Maybe they came back in tribute 
to their buddies who didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, most of our tourists are Dutch." 
</P>
<P>
I entered the grounds of Clervaux Castle, which was almost destroyed by the 
Germans in December, 1944, during the Battle of the Bulge. Restored, the castle 
houses several exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
An American tank, a favorite of Luxembourg school children, sits in the 
courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
The museum, dedicated to the battle, contains Allied and German memorabilia, 
including submachine guns, uniforms, mess kits, photographs and newspaper 
clippings. 
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg has two other Battle of the Bulge museums, in Wiltz and Diekirch. Of 
the three, Diekirch's is the newest and most extensive. 
</P>
<P>
In a small room on the castle top floor is where doudebilder (obituary 
photographs) are displayed of Luxembourg men and women who died in the war. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally handed out at funerals or printed in newspapers, these 
photographs are also of civilians who were killed during air raids or attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Less somber are the museum's two other exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
One displays 22 models of Luxembourg castles and details their history, with 
photographs and floor plans, showing whether they are in ruins or restored and 
whther they are privately or state-owned. 
</P>
<P>
The other exhibit is Edward Steichen's "Family of Man," with photographs from 
around the world of people working, playing, mourning, laughing and crying. 
</P>
<P>
Photographers represented in this display include Robert Capa, Henri 
Cartier-Bresson, Margaret Bourke-White and Dorothea Lange. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the castle courtyard is the Clervaux Tourist office, which has 
information on the town and an inexpensive map of the many walking paths 
radiating from Clervaux. 
</P>
<P>
One path is a 6.8-mile circular trail that starts and ends in Clervaux. Soon I 
found myself in the hills, in valleys and walking beside streams, wheat fields 
and wild flowers. The path encircles Clervaux, offering changing vistas of the 
village of stone. 
</P>
<P>
Highlight of this hiking tour is the Benedictine Abbey of St. Maurice and St. 
Maur, a striking, red-roofed structure in the midst of green woods on the crest 
of a hill overlooking Clervaux. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1910 in Romanesque style, it was founded by a group of Benedictine 
monks who were forced to leave their native France because of religious 
antagonism. 
</P>
<P>
In the basement of the abbey is a small museum showing the life of the monks. 
And in a small gift shop are religious recordings and artifacts as well as post 
cards that feature photographs taken by the monks. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee, roasted in Belgium and packaged by the monks, is sold at the front 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Clervaux, a quiet town, is engulfed by wooded hills. Life in the village 
centers on a pedestrian lane that hugs the base of the castle and an adjoining 
square lined with sidewalk cafes. 
</P>
<P>
Shops sell woolens, cotton undershirts, walking canes and gaudy souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
Men sporting berets or tweed caps, gray-haired women with canes, dogs on 
leashes, children in strollers and an occasional monk in a black flowing robe 
are part of the parade on Clervaux's main lane. 
</P>
<P>
By 10 p.m., however, streets are empty, except for the soldier that stands 
facing the tank in the castle courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
The statue erected in 1983 was sculpted by a Luxembourg artist and paid for 
from the admission fees of Clervaux's Battle of the Bulge museum and from local 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Icelandair is the only airline that flies from North America to Luxembourg, 
with gateways in New York City and Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of Luxembourg, Luxair buses run from the airport to the train 
station. The ride to Clervaux is less than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg tourist offices, at the airport and next to the train station, can 
make hotel reservations, but most hotels in Clervaux are closed in January and 
February. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel du Parc, on the rim of Clervaux on a wooded slope, is 120 years old. Its 
outdoor veranda, a good place for lunch, affords a great view of the castle and 
offers a menu of river trout with almonds, Burgundy snails, quails in grape 
sauce, veal, steak and lamb. Rooms start at $35 U.S. for two, including 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel du Commerce is a family-owned hotel in the middle of town. Doubles are 
about $40, including breakfast. 
</P>

Office, 801 2nd Ave., New York 10017, (212) 370-9850.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: QUAINT GALENA IS NO LONGER THE FORGOTTEN CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

GALENA, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This city has made a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Situated by the Galena River near the Mississippi in northwestern Illinois, 
Galena was the Midwest's business and cultural center in the mid-1800s. People 
exchanged local produce and ores for luxury goods brought up the river from the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
Main Street, lined with two- and three-story buildings, was dominated by DeSoto 
House, a hotel built in 1855 that accommodated traders, tourists and, on one 
occasion, Abraham Lincoln. Ulysses S. Grant, who lived in Galena, had a 
Victorian house on the hill overlooking town. 
</P>
<P>
Galena's fortunes changed when local politicians told the railroad to build its 
terminal elsewhere. River boats, they believed, were all the transportation 
that Galena needed. So the iron horse steamed into Chicago, then just a small 
town. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Population Moves 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's star subsequently rose and Galena's faded. When the mines gave out, 
much of Galena's population moved on and the town was all but forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
But after a century of neglect, Galena is thriving, with visitors attracted by 
the town's turn-of-the-century quaintness. 
</P>
<P>
Galena was featured in the recent hit film "Field of Dreams." A refurbished 
DeSoto House is often full, and Main Street's storefronts, all restored, offer 
antiques as well as reasonably priced clothing, personal accessories and home 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
Main Street runs from north to south, with shops concentrated in a five-block 
span. Begin at either end, but don't miss these: 
</P>
<P>
The Toy Soldier Collection (DeSoto House, 228 S. Main St.) sells miniature 
warriors (from $40) outfitted in Napoleonic, Civil War and other uniforms, plus 
diminutive Grants. Owner W. Paul Le Greco, a Grant look-alike, is well known 
for portraying Galena's most famous native son. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

$308. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Johnson's Gallery (202 S. Main St.) belongs to Galena's best-known artist. 
Johnson's realistic prints (from $30) and watercolors (from $300) feature 
scenes of Galena and its countryside. Also, one can often see Johnson working 
at his studio in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handmade Rugs 
</P>
<P>
The Gifted Drummer (127 S. Main St.), run by the Jo Daviess Workshop for the 
handicapped, has colorful handmade rag rugs (from $22) and tote bags ($13), 
old-fashioned alphabet blocks ($10), heart-shaped fly swatters ($8), checker 
games with little houses for playing pieces ($22), corn-husk flowers ($2) and 
wooden tulips ($1.25). 
</P>
<P>

name with homemade ice cream -- cones (95 cents) and other treats served from 
behind the shop's original and beautiful wooden soda fountain. 
</P>
<P>

FOOTLOOSE: ITALY GIVES LUGANO ITS HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
LUGANO, Switzerland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The flag bears a white cross on a field of red. The money here also is Swiss. 
But for travelers to this country's southernmost canton of Ticino, there's a 
feeling of Italy -- with all of its warmth, culture, language, sights and 
sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lugano, in an almost subtropical bay about halfway down the shore of Lake 
Lugano, has been called an Italian jewel set in a Swiss watch. 
</P>
<P>
The canton became part of the Swiss Confederation in 1803, and the Ticinese are 
fiercely proud of their Italian heritage. Architecture fairly breathes the 
Mediterranean air of Italy, and many citizens of Lugano still venture forth to 
shop in Italy across the nearby border. 
</P>
<P>
This proximity to Italy has caused the shores of Lake Lugano to be a haven for 
smugglers through the years. 
</P>
<P>
To get here: Fly TWA, American or Pan Am to Zurich, or Balair through October, 
when Swissair begins nonstop Los Angeles-Zurich service. Take a train ride 
through the heart of Switzerland to Lugano, perhaps using a Swiss Pass, which 
allows rides on trains, buses, lake steamers and city trams throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Give Lugano two days, maybe another for boat trips to the 
Swiss and Italian towns rimming Lake Lugano. Lodging costs are moderate for 
Switzerland, dining the same. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The Swiss franc recently traded at 1.5 to the dollar, or 66 
cents each. Weather is lovely most of the year, although the altitude and water 
generate morning haze during summers. City buses run along the lake front and 
inland at 10-minute intervals. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: International au Lac (Via Nassa 68; $86-$121 double 
B&amp;B) is on a small piazza in the heart of town. A family-run hotel in the 
traditional mold, with handsome antiques and statuary throughout. Front rooms 
have views of the lake but rear ones are quieter. All fresh with flowered 
prints and fluffy comforters. The restaurant, a pretty garden courtyard in 
back, also serves coffee and drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Bellevue au Lac (Riva Caccia 10; $119-$132 double with buffet breakfasts) also 
stands facing the lake front in the upscale Paradiso section of town. This is 
another older, family-run hotel, with guests who return yearly. The dining 
room's pension-plan food is light years beyond the usual hotel fare, with 
dinner a five-course affair by candlelight. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Colorado (Via Maraini 19; $76-$112 double B&amp;B) sits on a hill above 
town overlooking the lake and the beautiful little Church of San Loreto just a 
couple of bus stops from the train station. Public areas and bedrooms are 
contemporary, those with balconies and view of the lake the more expensive. 
Colorado's shining light is its Tavernetta grill, a delightful, cellar-like 
affair with a menu strong on good Italian food. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Swiss dishes appear on Lugano's menus, but the locals 
prefer the northern Italian food and manner of cooking from neighboring 
Lombardy. This means that you'll encounter plenty of pasta, rice, polenta, 
spezzatini (cubes of stewed or braised meat in a hearty sauce) and such soups 
as minestrone Ticinese. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also find dishes from Switzerland's other neighbors: France, Germany 
and Austria. Yet the vineyards of Ticino stick pretty much to Merlot wines, 
mellow and full-bodied reds that go well with south-of-the-border food. And 
Swiss beer is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Gambrinus (Piazza della Riforma) is one of the town's most popular 
restaurants. It's on the main square, with tables outside, a very informal 
interior, and the accent is on seafood and Italian dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Gambrinus' owner-chef puts his emphasis on seasonal specialties (nothing 
frozen), which leads to superb cream of asparagus soup, springtime mushrooms 
and other fresh vegetables, lake and sea fish, plus game. The menu is 
extensive. 
</P>
<P>
La Tinera (just off Piazza della Riforma) is a rustic cellar tavern featuring 
an old wine vat and a low-beamed ceiling. Hams, salamis, antique guns, plates 
and assorted other knickknacks hang from the walls and beams. The informal 
ambience is typically Ticinese, with menu to match. Try the luganiga al 
cartoccio (local sausage cooked in a paper bag), osso buco (veal shank) with 
saffron rice or one of the several pastas. 
</P>
<P>
Al Faro (Riva Paradiso 36) has become the town's best and trendiest seafood 
restaurant. The shipboard decor is pleasantly without tackiness, and table 
settings are elegant. Choose live fish, shellfish or lobster from Al Faro's 
tanks, or order from the haul of its daily boat. A six-course gastronomique 
menu goes for $45, or settle for pasta with lobster or risotto di mare, both in 
the $12 range. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Romantik Hotel Ticino (Piazza Cioccaro 1; $152-$172 double, 
buffet breakfasts) measures up handsomely to being a member of the esteemed 
Romantik Hotels group. It was a 16th-Century convent (still protected by the 
city) and the 23 rooms are built around a courtyard with a fountain and 
cascading greenery. Some rooms are on the small side, all decorated in a 
charming, old-fashioned way in pastels and beiges. 
</P>
<P>
The long and narrow dining room with individual booths has a very warm feeling, 
with tables holding centerpieces of nosegays in silver goblets. The 
French-Italian, four-course menu is $39, $25 without the first course. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Many visitors take a steamer ride on the lake to the Ticino 
village of Morcote, then continue to Ponte Tresa at the Italian border. 
Morcote, like Lugano, is a town of beautiful arcades lined with tempting shops. 
</P>
<P>
Museum directors around the world have long cast a covetous eye on the 
magnificent art collection of Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza in his lake-shore Villa 
Favorita. It boggles the mind to see the lode of paintings -- among them El 
Greco, Goya, Raphael, Rembrandt, Rubens and Titian. As a private collection, it 
is second only to that of Great Britain's Queen Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
Lugano affords its visitors a trip through all of Switzerland in the form of 
Miniatur Village with the country's most picturesque buildings, churches and 
monuments. It's on the edge of town and well worth a visit. 
</P>
<P>
After strolling through the arcades of town and stopping in the simple 
Romanesque-Lombard Church of Santa Maria degli Angioli with its 16th-Century 
murals, take a funicular to the top of San Salvatore mountain for stunning 
views of the lake. There's a restaurant at the summit, plus a terrace with 
tables for picnickers. Our salami, cheese, sturdy Swiss bread and wine tasted 
even better there. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Swiss National Tourist Office at (415) 362-2260, 
or write to 260 Stockton St., San Francisco 94108, for a brochure on Lugano 
with city map and hotel listing, a map of all Switzerland and information on 
the Swiss Pass. Ask for the Lugano package.

THE LONELIEST ROAD IN THE FAR NORTH

ON THE DALTON HIGHWAY, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the other side of the pipeline, less than 200 yards from this storied 
416-mile gravel road leading into Alaska's far north, a huge grizzly sow 
browsing for berries glowed golden in the slanting rays of the Arctic summer's 
never-ending sun. Nearby, her two cubs tumbled in a bruising game. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 yards upwind, a big cow moose and her spindle-legged calf grazed, 
knowing they were protected from the deadly grizzly by wind direction and the 
bear's terrible eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska natives can spend a lifetime without seeing a single elusive grizzly, 
much less a family of three at one time, but we were lucky. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctantly, we left the grizzlies and climbed back aboard the bus to continue 
our journey over the Brooks Range, jutting impressively ahead, and on to frigid 
Coldfoot for the night. The next day we would plunge into the vast Yukon River 
Basin, then roll into Fairbanks in late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Departure from Prudhoe Bay's remote oil camp was early in the morning on the 
only road connecting Prudhoe with Fairbanks nearly 500 miles to the south. We 
had been paralleling part of the 800-mile Trans Alaska Pipeline System -- at $8 
billion, the most costly, privately financed construction project ever. 
</P>
<P>
We had arrived by air from Fairbanks a day earlier and had been driven around 
the oil fields and pipeline terminus. We saw distant bands of caribou (it was 
too early for the vast herds that arrived later), stayed overnight in the 
Arctic Caribou Inn, which had been left over from the boom days of construction 
and exploration, and dined in a cafeteria with bemused oil workers. 
</P>
<P>
Road travel is closed to private vehicles above the Arctic Circle, and casual 
visitors are prohibited from leaving Prudhoe's airport at Deadhorse. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually everything is owned by the oil companies and closed to outsiders; 
there are no taxis, no restaurants and no hotels that aren't private. 
</P>
<P>
The bus tours offered by Princess Tours and Westours' Gray Line of Alaska are 
the only way to reach, explore and overnight at the forlorn place at the end of 
an arid tundra wasteland that daily produces two million gallons, or one-fifth 
of the country's domestic oil. 
</P>
<P>
The fascinating and somewhat primitive tours began just three summers ago when 
a handful of experimental tours, using the Dalton Highway and empty facilities 
owned by the Prudhoe area's Native Alaska Trust, were approved by the state and 
the oil companies controlling access to Prudhoe. 
</P>
<P>
The tours launched by Princess were soon expanded into a robust program that 
this summer is providing 73 northbound and southbound departures by Princess 
and Gray Line. 
</P>
<P>
One key to establishing the tour programs was to get permission to travel the 
narrow, fragile ribbon of the Dalton Highway that is open only to 
permit-holding vehicles. Another was convincing Dick and Cathy Mackey to add an 
inn to their restaurant and truck stop in Coldfoot, which is about halfway 
between Prudhoe and Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the Dalton Highway began in 1974. Built as a supply conduit for 
the pipeline, it is closed to most traffic past aptly-named Disaster Creek 
because of the dangers inherent in driving in the empty Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
The Mackeys, proprietors of the world's northernmost truck stop (as well as 
America's northernmost saloon), were persuaded that enough travelers would pay 
for tours above the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
The state eventually gave its approval to a limited number of bus trips, 
reasoning that experienced drivers and radio contact minimized the chance of a 
mishap along a road so remote that there is not a single structure -- except 
for isolated pipeline facilities -- all the way from Coldfoot to Prudhoe. Then 
the Mackeys built their Arctic Acres Inn, which has been expanded to 52 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Our tour began in Fairbanks, where we boarded a jet and flew to Prudhoe Bay. 
But it didn't look like the last day of May as we circled to land 1,300 miles 
from the North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot had warned us, issuing what sounded like a gleeful chuckle, that snow 
was blowing and it was 27 degrees at Prudhoe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Treeless Plain 
</P>
<P>
As we banked low over the still-frozen Beaufort Sea for the approach to the 
ominously named Deadhorse, the ice merged with the tundra to produce a seamless 
vista of flat, featureless gloom. 
</P>
<P>
Not one oil well or a single caribou was visible on the great treeless plain of 
Alaska's North Slope, which is famous for both. 
</P>
<P>
The plane bumped onto a runway that no one ever saw and rolled to a stop in 
front of low buildings that were the same shade of dull gray as the overcast 
that blanketed everything. When we stepped outside, snow stung our eyes and the 
cold made our teeth rattle. 
</P>
<P>
Deadhorse and Prudhoe have no permanent residents for a very good reason. The 
isolation is mentally stressful, particularly in the dark Arctic winter, where, 
for 56 days, the sun fails to rise at all. Workers generally are limited to 
nine weeks of 10 to 12 hours on the job daily before being flown south. It's no 
wonder that both firearms and alcohol are banned. 
</P>
<P>
We shuffled across the Tarmac, through the terminal and into a waiting motor 
coach, in which the driver grinned at our amazement. 
</P>
<P>
"Take your time," he drawled in reference to summer's 75 days above the Arctic 
Circle when the sun doesn't set. "It won't get dark until August." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little-Seen Wildlife 
</P>
<P>
Along with the fascination of Prudhoe's desolation and its technological 
marvels, it was also a rare opportunity to view some of the most spectacular 
and seldom-seen wilderness and wildlife in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The imposing Brooks Range that slashes across Alaska above the Arctic Circle is 
a remote and untouched mountain chain. The great tundra plain of the North 
Slope, with its clouds of caribou and other wildlife, is considered the 
Serengeti Plain of North America. 
</P>
<P>
On that flat and lonely Arctic plain, far past the northern tree line, the 
permafrost extends down into the earth about half a mile. Yet in the few short 
weeks of summer, with the coming of the caribou and the return of migrating 
waterfowl and other birds, the suddenly awakened tundra puddles and teems with 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Carpets of flowers explode from nowhere. But beware of mosquitoes and don't 
forget to take along insect repellent. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Other meals are additional, including a breakfast buffet at Prudhoe and a 
$14.50 dinner buffet at Coldfoot's Arctic Acres Inn.

PROP. 60 GRIDLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the Speaking Out article by Jenny Erickson ("Property Tax Transfers 
Hit Gridlock," July 16): 
</P>
<P>
The essence of government is to implement laws and serve the people. 
Apparently, this is not the case in the offices of the assessor and tax 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
I was outraged upon finding that Proposition 60 was being "bungled" and stalled 
in the Hall of Administration bureaucracy. As a result, thousands of senior 
citizens who have sold their homes and re-purchased residences in Los Angeles 
County under Proposition 60 may have tax liens upon their properties. Upon 
investigation, many homeowners who have filed their Proposition 60 papers find 
inadequate administration of the program, thus jeopardizing titles to their 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
As a city founder and former councilman, I assumed leadership of our state 
volunteer organization upon the passing of Howard Jarvis. I know the system, 
and how it should work. And, I can tell you -- frankly -- that Howard must be 
turning over in his grave thinking about how a county with its $9.6 billion 
budget, is balancing its cash flow by excess collections of taxes from senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors needs help in putting this 
Proposition 60 program on track, we would be willing to help them straighten 
out this mess fast. Otherwise, the taxpayers of the county, who have been 
affected by Proposition 60 adversely, may have to resort to class-action 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
I hope these public officials realize the seriousness and immediacy of this 
problem area.

SELLING 'TOO CHEAP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Robert J. Bruss' Real Estate Q&amp;A column responding to sellers who 
made a deal and then wanted to wiggle out because they later thought they'd 
sold for too little ("Seller Outsmarted by a 'Nice Couple' " July 16). 
</P>
<P>
The sellers admit they accepted what seemed "very fair" and they entered into a 
valid, legally enforceable contract of sale. Then they started to talk to 
neighbors who, as neighbors will, advised them they had sold too cheap. 
</P>
<P>
The sellers should have paid no attention to gossip from neighbors, who are 
notoriously a very bad source of information regarding the validity of home 
sales prices. They rarely have any inside dope about why a property sold for a 
certain price. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a seller offers to assist the buyer with financing and asks more 
money, which the buyer is happy to pay. Improvements on properties can account 
for a price differential. Concessions made by a seller to facilitate a buyer's 
special needs (i.e., length of escrow, occupancy date) may justify a higher 
price. 
</P>
<P>
The letter writer asks, "What should we do?" Bruss replies "I suggest you go 
ahead and sell the house. . . ." The implication of this suggestion is that the 
sellers may have other options. They don't. If there is no basis upon which to 
rescind the contract, the sellers must perform under its terms or leave 
themselves open to the legal action they have already encountered. 
</P>
<P>
Bruss claims that sellers do not find themselves in this kind of predicament if 
they employ a "professional" real estate agent. Nonsense! Real estate 
salespeople often "price down" properties in order to move them quickly. An 
attractive price gets the property sold faster and the commission paid sooner. 
</P>
<P>
It is common practice in the real estate business for listing agents to induce 
sellers to reduce their expected sales price. It is even more common for 
selling agents to accept offers substantially under the listed price and 
attempt to persuade sellers that it's in their best interests to accept the low 
offers. Bruss indicates that "professional" real estate agents will get sellers 
top dollar. It ain't necessarily so.

NOT SO HANDY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How can one equate advertising with poor quality workmanship or deduce that the 
workmen can't get enough business through referrals? Rubbish! Some of my larger 
jobs have come from advertising in local throwaway newspapers, and it is a tool 
I use for increasing my business. Should consumers avoid all businesses that 
advertise? 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, if a contract is signed by an unlicensed tradesman, the consumer 
has little recourse if the work proves to be shoddy, inadequate or left 
incomplete. Furthermore, contracts must be of a specific form and content, 
including notification of the right to cancel the contract within three 
business days of execution.

NOT SO HANDY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A handyman may be the right person to replace washers, tighten hinges, replace 
switch plates and perform other tasks where a journeyman's skill is not needed. 
He is the wrong person to trust when safety or a considerable investment is 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
The list of botched handyman jobs I have seen is enormous: showers that leak, 
crooked tile setting, electrical outlets not grounded, windows installed 
backwards, and on and on. These butchered jobs not only cost the homeowner more 
than he hoped to save by hiring a handyman but have an emotional price to that 
homeowner and to skilled, conscientious tradesmen who face hostility they have 
not earned. 
</P>
<P>
A typical apprenticeship in a building trade lasts four years. Mastery can take 
a lifetime. Think of the work vehicle of a plumber, electrician or carpenter. 
It's loaded with the tools and specialized equipment he needs to do his work. 
How many handymen have this education and equipment for even one of the several 
trades they "practice"? 
</P>
<P>
I have nothing against handymen as long as they stay within their realm of 
competence.

Yes, there are chickens in the city -- if you thought you were hallucinating 
when you heard their crows early one morning -- and some of them live in pretty 
nice neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Hancock Park, for instance, where Chip, Bomber, Tyson (all hens, misnamed as 
baby chicks) and Sabina (the rooster, also named before anyone knew better) 
make themselves useful by ridding the garden of slugs and bugs. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, chickens are a gardener's best friend. What they eat reads like a 
who's who of unwelcome critters, including but not limited to snails (which 
they shake out of their shells), slugs, earwigs (better known in California as 
"pincherbugs"), sow bugs, cutworms and miscellaneous caterpillars and 
inchworms. 
</P>
<P>
In the Laurie and George Stoneman garden, behind an elegant English home beside 
the Wilshire Country Club, chickens play an important role, consuming pests and 
kitchen scraps and yielding potent fertilizer, plus enough eggs to make many a 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Bantam Rooster 
</P>
<P>
Because these are city chickens, they are all hens, except for the one rooster, 
and he is a bantam. Bantams are the subcompact of the chicken world, and Sabina 
has a pint-sized crow that neighbors hardly notice. 
</P>
<P>
For city dwellers, hens are the best bet because they make no noise. In the 
Stonemans' original order for a "Bantam Assortment" from a firm in Missouri 
were several noisy roosters that were given to a petting farm for children. 
</P>
<P>
The trick is to buy only "pullets," what poultry people call baby hens, so you 
don't end up with roosters to dispose of. In the country of course, the 
roosters (called "cockerels" when they are chicks) become Sunday dinner. 
</P>
<P>
As well as eating all sorts of garden pests, chickens take care of most 
leftovers and kitchen scraps. In return, you get eggs quite unlike 
store-bought, with rich orange yolks that "make scrambled eggs glow on the 
plate," according to Laurie Stoneman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mail Order Eggs 
</P>
<P>
It was the Stonemans' son, Josh, who got them started with chickens many years 
ago, when he was at that age when animals, especially those that make unlikely 
pets, are irresistible to small boys. 
</P>
<P>
They began with a "Purebred Bantam Assortment" of eggs ordered through the mail 
from Crow Poultry &amp; Supply Co. (Box 106, Windsor, Mo., 65360-0106). They 
also ordered a small table-top incubator and watched the eggs hatch into a very 
mixed bag of old English game hens, booted cochins, silver-spangled Hamburgs 
and the odd araucanas that lay colored eggs fit for an Easter basket. 
</P>
<P>
(One good way to learn about the various breeds of chickens and find growers 
who can sell you only pullets, is to attend the Los Angeles County Fair in 
September in Pomona, where one of the halls holds a huge chicken show.) 
</P>
<P>
Chickens are legal in the city, at least the city of Los Angeles. That is 
perhaps the first of many chicken misconceptions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check Local Law 
</P>
<P>
The city ordinance that applies (Section 53.59 of the Municipal Code), says 
that any number of hens are allowed as long as they are housed 20 feet from the 
owner's house and 35 feet from any neighbor's dwelling. Roosters, however, must 
be kept 100 feet from any dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
To check ordinances in another city, call the appropriate department of animal 
control; not all cities are as wonderfully tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
The second chicken misconception is that you must have a rooster to have eggs. 
Nope, only for fertile eggs. Hens are quite fine all by themselves, making only 
soft clucking noises that will not disturb even the grouchiest neighbors, with 
the better egg-laying breeds laying up to one a day. 
</P>
<P>
Another misconception is that chickens draw flies. Actually they eat any flies 
attracted to their nesting area, and if they're kept on the ground, where their 
constant scratching of the soil keeps things tidy, and if not crowded into some 
small coop, they are not smelly or particularly messy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keep Out Possums 
</P>
<P>
The Stonemans keep their flock in a large fenced area on the ground, with 
nesting boxes for the hens and screening on the top to keep out possums and 
raccoons, though in most neighborhoods, dogs are the biggest threat and 
enclosures should be made of tough welded wire. 
</P>
<P>
During the day, the chickens wander the garden, pecking and scratching, looking 
for bugs and little seedlings. "We don't let them out right after planting 
anything as seedlings, but most of the time, they only eat grass and oxalis (a 
weed), and don't touch the plants, but they sure keep the garden free of bugs," 
Laurie Stoneman said. 
</P>
<P>
At night, the chickens return to the coop. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to spend hours running after them until we realized that as it gets 
dark, chickens fall asleep wherever they are and you can just scoop them up and 
put them away. Now they know the routine and put themselves to bed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad you're writing about our chickens," she added, "because now people 
won't think we're so crazy." Certainly gardeners and those who like fresh eggs 
for breakfast will not.

GRAPEFRUIT: HOW SWEET THEY CAN BE; 
</P>
<P>
TWO FAIRLY NEW VARIETIES LACK THE BITTERNESS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH FRUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM, Sidnam has written garden columns and features for The Times 
since 1975. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to John Pehrson, a citrus specialist at the University of 
California's Lindcove Field Station, once people sample Melogold or Oroblanco 
grapefruit, they will probably never again be satisfied with ordinary 
grapefruits. 
</P>
<P>
The grapefruit Pehrson was referring to are two fairly new grapefruit varieties 
that lack the bitterness associated with ordinary grapefruit. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Melogold and Oroblanco varieties are almost as sweet as a navel 
orange, although they have the characteristic flavor of the grapefruit, and 
both varieties are seedless. Even people who are not fond of grapefruit will 
probably appreciate these varieties -- grapefruit fanciers will be ecstatic 
over them. 
</P>
<P>
Both were developed by crossing a grapefruit with a pummelo. Both Melogold and 
Oroblanco were developed at UC Riverside, by geneticists Robert K. Soost and 
James C. Cammeron. 
</P>
<P>
Both grapefruit will grow and produce in home orchards in much of the 
Southland. Generally the production will probably be better and the fruit of 
better quality in warmer areas. However, I live in a mild area of Orange County 
and I have an Oroblanco tree in my yard that produces marvelous, sweet fruit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scarce in Nurseries 
</P>
<P>
Oroblanco trees have been available in local nurseries for about six years, but 
budwood for Melogold was just released two years ago by the university to 
wholesale growers for propagation. The trees are scarce in retail nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
I asked John Pehrson which one of these two super-grapefruit actually had the 
best flavor. He said it all depended on who was doing the testing. For 
instance, Pherson prefers the Melogold, while his wife favors the Oroblanco. 
</P>
<P>
Pherson suggested I do a taste test and I took him up on it. With the help of 
five friends, we sampled and compared Oroblanco and Melogold with a standard 
grapefruit variety (Marsh) and then compared them with each other. In 
comparison with the standard grapefruit, it was no contest. Both Oroblanco and 
Melogold won hands down, and one of the tasters remarked that she wondered how 
she could go back to eating ordinary grapefruit again. 
</P>
<P>
In the contest between Oroblanco and Melogold, five of us preferred Melogold 
and one favored Oroblanco. The one who opted for Oroblanco thought that there 
was a slight aftertaste with Melogold. Pehrson acknowledged that a few others 
had noted the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judged Absolutely Superb 
</P>
<P>
The tasters all felt that Melogold was a little juicier, although two tasters 
felt Oroblanco was sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
Both varieties were judged absolutely superb. In physical appearance, both 
Oroblanco and Melogold are colored like the typical yellow grapefruit. 
Melogold, however, has larger fruit than a standard grapefruit. 
</P>
<P>
If you like grapefruit and have room in our yard (there areno dwarf trees yet), 
I highly recommend either Melogold or Oroblanco. I feel that these are truly 
the grapefruit of the future. Oroblanco trees are usually easy to locate in 
nurseries, while Melogold trees are difficult to find at present. 
</P>
<P>
Purchase only healthy, vigorous looking transplants. Avoid trees with long 
trunks and branches concentrated at the top; the tree should have good skirt 
branches. If the transplant has any fruit on it, pick it off so the tree's 
energies will be devoted to foliage production. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plant in Sunny Area 
</P>
<P>
Plant your tree in a sunny area and make certain that the grafting union is at 
least 3 inches above the soil line. Dig a hole twice as wide as the root ball, 
but only as deep as the tree was originally grown. Plant the tree and refill 
the hole with the soil you originally removed. 
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer tablets, such as Osmocote Planting Tablets or Jobe's Tree Spikes, 
added to the soil at planting time will feed the young tree without burning it. 
Water thoroughly after transplanting. Wrap the trunk of the new tree with a 
tree wrap material available at nurseries or paint it with a white latex paint 
to prevent sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
Irrigate the new tree twice a week, or more frequently during hot weather, then 
water it on a weekly basis but not as often during late fall and winter. 
Fertilize in February or March and again in July or August with a 
general-purpose citrus food. Do not fertilize in late fall. This promotes new 
tender foliage growth that would be subject to frost damage during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on your location, Melogold and Oroblanco will be ready for harvest 
between December and February.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: NEW DESIGN REDUCES AIR CONDITIONER COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Would you explain how the new scroll compressor-type of central air 
conditioner works. Is it really more energy-efficiency and more 
maintenance-free as the contractors tell me? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The most recent major design innovation for central air conditioners is 
a high-efficiency scroll compressor in place of a standard piston-type 
compressor. A new scroll compressor air conditioner can cut your electric bills 
significantly and minimize maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
Several air conditioner manufacturers are now using scroll compressors with 
seasonal energy efficiency ratios (SEER) up to 12. Your old unit may have a 
SEER as low as 6. SEER relates the amount of cooling output of a central air 
conditioner to the amount of electricity it uses. 
</P>
<P>
By its design, the scroll compressor is very reliable. Unlike conventional 
compressors with many moving parts, pistons, valves, seals, etc., a scroll 
compressor has only four moving parts. 
</P>
<P>
As it gets older, the few moving parts of a scroll compressor actually wear in 
and operate better. It is also more tolerant of foreign matter and fluids in 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
Without the pistons and valves used in a standard compressor, a scroll 
compressor operates more quietly and more vibration-free. This is an advantage 
both for you and your neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The operating principle of a scroll compressor is simple. Two spiral-shaped 
members fit together. One remains stationary, while the other orbits relative 
to it. This creates gas pockets which gradually decrease in size to compress 
the Freon. 
</P>
<P>
Since several pockets of Freon are compressed simultaneously in the scroll 
members, it produces a smooth and nearly continuous compression cycle. In 
contrast, a standard piston compressor produces fewer and larger compression 
pulses per cycle. 
</P>
<P>
When you select a new central air conditioner, have your contractor do a 
detailed heat gain analysis for your house. Many use computers and 
sophisticated programs. An improperly sized central air conditioner not only 
wastes electricity, but doesn't provide the best comfort level. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 042, showing a list of 
manufacturers, model numbers and SEER's of air conditioners using scroll 
compressors, a chart showing the electricity saving by installing a 
high-efficiency unit and more detailed information on the scroll compressor.

Alarms Required to Have Battery, Power 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have heard that some areas require smoke alarms that are powered by both 
batteries and regular house electricity. Since these operate continuously, will 
they be expensive to operate? 
</P>
<P>
A: The amount of current usage is very low and the operating cost is 
negligible. The reason for requiring two power sources, batteries and house 
current, is that people often let the batteries run down. They plan to replace 
them, but never get around to doing it, and then they forget. Without power, 
the smoke alarm provides no protection. 
</P>
<P>
To keep people from removing the batteries to avoid annoying false alarms when 
cooking, some new smoke alarms offer a hush control. This allows you to press a 
button to temporarily decrease the sensitivity of the alarm. It resets to 
normal sensitivity automatically. 
</P>

WATER SUPPLIER FIRST TO TEST QUALITY WITH OWN LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holding the test tube to the light, Dawn White flicks the sample of well water, 
checking for cloudiness or gases that may have been emitted during the tube's 
two days in an incubator. 
</P>
<P>
The water, which has been mixed in a broth that supports bacterial growth, is 
clear, indicating it is free of coliforms. If these harmless bacteria had been 
detected, their presence would have been a clue that pathogens, dangerous 
bacteria that could cause intestinal problems, might be lurking in the water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bulk of Workload 
</P>
<P>
With 500 samples a month from California-American Water Co.'s 29 wells and 
distribution systems in the San Gabriel Valley, coliform-testing is the bulk of 
the workload for White, water quality supervisor at the firm's new laboratory 
in Rosemead. Cal-Am supplies about 20 million gallons of water daily to 
communities in Rosemead, El Monte, San Gabriel, Duarte, Bradbury, San Marino, 
Temple City and Baldwin Hills, White said. 
</P>
<P>
Most chemical contaminants, such as oil or fertilizers, enter the underground 
water supply after being dumped by businesses and individuals. Bacterial 
contamination often results when underground water is exposed to airborne 
bacteria through corroded pipes or other problems. About 70 wells in the valley 
have been shut down because of contaminants found in water samples, according 
to Bob Berlien, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The Main San Gabriel Basin, which supplies water to about 1 million residents, 
has been designated a Superfund cleanup site by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Cal-Am is the only one of the more than 40 private water suppliers in the 
valley with an in-house water-testing facility, Berlien said. The laboratory, 
which will also test supplies delivered to residents of Coronado, Newbury Park 
and parts of Camarillo, was dedicated Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Most water companies contract with three major commercial laboratories in the 
area to meet testing requirements set by the state Department of Health 
Services, Berlien said. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of outside (commercial) testing is phenomenal," said David 
Stephenson, Cal-Am director of rates and revenues. If all the company's testing 
were contracted out to private labs, the price would be nearly $129,000, 
according to Jim McVeigh, Cal-Am director of water quality. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the $250,000 lab in Rosemead, Cal-Am will still mail samples to its 
laboratory in Monterey, Calif., for more complicated tests for metals and 
organic and inorganic compounds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's customers will pay less than $1 more per year to offset the costs of 
the lab, Stephenson said. 
</P>
<P>
Coliform samples must be collected weekly because bacteriological conditions 
can change so quickly, White said. State law requires that one sample be tested 
for every 1,000 "services" the company supplies. A service could refer to a 
single home or an entire apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
If coliforms are found, the affected piping system would be flushed, and 
increased amounts of chlorine would be added to kill the bacteria, she said. 
Bacteria-free water from underground wells is routinely treated with low levels 
of chlorine to protect it from bacterial growth as it travel to the customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aid for Maintenance 
</P>
<P>
Test results also help with maintenance. "If the numbers (of bacteria) are 
high, it might indicate a growth in the pipes, which would lead to problems 
like corrosion," White said. 
</P>
<P>
She also checks the levels of nitrates and fluorides. "A lot of the work we do 
is very routine because our wells are very clean," she said. Water from some 
Cal-Am wells in the San Marino-Pasadena area is blended with water purchased 
from the Metropolitan Water District to reduce high levels of nitrates. 
</P>
<P>
"You do what you have to do to keep the system safe," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal-Am decided to build the lab in Los Angeles because of the increasing number 
of compounds the state requires water companies to test for, McVeigh said. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health Services will add at least 25 more compounds to the 
list this year, according to Susan Nielson, Pasadena's civil engineer in charge 
of water quality. Pasadena spends $30,000 a year for water-testing at 
commercial labs, although an in-house facility checks for particular 
contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which supplies nearly 37,000 services from its own wells and water 
purchased from the Metropolitan Water District, is studying a lab expansion 
because of the expected increases in workload. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In-House Lab a Luxury 
</P>
<P>
But most cities that supply their own water cannot afford the luxury of an 
in-house lab. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia, which pays $30,000 a year to send out all its samples for testing, 
still finds that cheaper than conducting its own tests, said Rita Kurth, 
administrative assistant for the city's water department. "We couldn't run a 
lab for $30,000 a year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nels Palm, director of public works in Monterey Park called the equipment 
necessary for testing "completely out-of-sight, cost-wise." The city supplies 
more than 12,000 services from its own wells and will pay a lab more than 
$35,000 this year for testing.

SECRETS OF THE NATURAL WRITER GLEANED AT THE TRAIL'S END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the students hiked into the Santa Monica Mountains toward Eagle Rock, they 
stopped to study the rocks, the clouds and a horned lizard, the size of a 
quarter, that could have starred in a movie called "Honey, I Shrunk the 
Stegosaurus." 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, a student dropped behind, pulled a journal from pocket or 
backpack and scribbled a paragraph or two. One student wrote a mini-essay about 
life and death, inspired by a patch of dead buckwheat. Another noted that the 
mountain trail was "as wide as a spare rib." 
</P>
<P>
The 16 students were taking an unusual course being offered for the first time 
this summer by Santa Monica College. Called "Writing About Nature," the 
double-credit course is an introduction to physical geography and a beginning 
composition course. Taught by geographer Bill Selby and poet Jim Krusoe, it 
requires students to learn how to use both a sling psychrometer and a simile. 
Those who succeed get credit for both Geography 1 and English 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although the teachers' disciplines diverge dramatically, Selby and Krusoe say 
they have a common goal -- to teach students to observe closely and to record 
their observations with precision. "So many of our students have lost the 
ability to observe things that aren't fed to them," Selby said. "You have to be 
a good observer to be a great writer, and there's never been a great scientist 
who wasn't a great observer." 
</P>
<P>
During the six-week course, the students learn something about maps, weather 
and climate, geology and the plants and animals of Southern California. They 
work their way through a text called "Modern Physical Geography." Classroom 
lessons are supplemented with a weekly field trip, such as the recent hike to 
Eagle Rock in Topanga State Park. As the students are learning what an 
inversion is they are also studying nature writing and learning how to string 
together their own words about the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, they have to learn to write in six weeks," Krusoe said. "It's a 
killer." 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe exposes the students to model nature writers as disparate as Romantic 
poet William Wordsworth and contemporary environmental activist Edward Abbey. 
According to Krusoe, Sue Hubbell's book, "Country Year," is especially useful 
to beginning nature writers. 
</P>
<P>
In critiquing students' journal entries, Krusoe is quick to praise evidence 
that they are paying close attention, whether observing an alligator lizard 
barely visible in the dust or a distant cluster of homes that looks like a 
beehive when viewed from the mountains. "The funny thing about paying 
attention," he told his students, as they perched on Eagle Rock, moments after 
displacing a raven, "is that when you really see something, sometimes it's even 
better than just using your imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe said students tend to "get too pretty" when they begin to write about 
storm clouds and life cycles. Krusoe's reading assignments for the course are 
examples of writing about nature without verbal genuflection. The assigned 
writers have "natural voices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a geographer, Selby said he is repeatedly shocked and saddened at the lack 
of widespread knowledge about weather, the rock cycle and other natural 
phenomena. "It's scary to know that so many people know so little about the 
world we live in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Resting with the students on Eagle Rock, Selby talked about the materials that 
formed the outcropping and the natural forces that created it. Geology lessons 
are much more vivid in the wild than in the classroom. "You can't stand here 
and see the rock cycle, but you get a feeling for how the rock cycle is 
changing the landscape," Selby said. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Batiste, 26, said she had taken the course to fulfill a science 
requirement and because she thought she would benefit from the writing 
component. After the first class, the Inglewood woman recalled, she was able to 
identify the stone in the campus parking lot as shale. 
</P>
<P>
Batiste has also become a seasoned hiker. On the first couple of outings, she 
was startled by every dive-bombing dragonfly. "I've really gotten better," she 
said, undaunted by the slither of a lizard in the dry grass. 
</P>
<P>
After Selby's geology lesson on Eagle Rock, Krusoe asked the students to read 
their journal entries aloud. Like a conscientious parent, he tries to teach his 
charges without battering their self-esteem. "On a really good day," the poet 
said, "I feel my compliments are as creative as anything I've ever done."

TEEN LEADERS FIND D.C. A CAPITAL EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a hostess at the Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington, D.C., began lecturing 
and shouting at a group of young visitors, Karin Bartel of Monrovia was taken 
aback. 
</P>
<P>
"She was perturbed at Americans," said Bartel, 18. "I had to step back and try 
to understand their side of it." 
</P>
<P>
Bartel is among three San Gabriel Valley teen-agers who visited legislators, 
diplomats and lobbyists in Washington last week as scholars in the Postgraduate 
National Young Leaders Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Other San Gabriel Valley youths attending the weeklong conference were Kevin 
Eng of South Pasadena and Malcolm Murphy of Pasadena. Neil Mouneimne of 
neighboring La Canada Flintridge, was also one of 350 teen-agers attending 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The conference is sponsored by the Congressional Youth Leadership Council, a 
4-year-old, nonprofit, educational organization designed to give young people a 
chance to learn more about the workings of government. Selection of the 
teen-agers was based on their academic achievement and leadership skills, a 
council spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
During their week in the nation's capital, the students met with California 
senators Alan Cranston and Pete Wilson. Bartel, Mouneimne and Eng also met 
their congressman, Rep. Carlos Moorhead (R-Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 18, was scheduled to spend time with his congressman, Edward Roybal 
(D-Los Angeles). A graduate of Don Bosco Technical High School in Rosemead, he 
plans to attend Pasadena City College in September. He is active in the youth 
group at St. Andrew's Catholic Church in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Bartel, who plans to study English at Cal Poly Pomona and become a high school 
teacher, said: "I think this is good experience for a teacher. This is 
something I can share with students." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Rio Hondo Preparatory School in Arcadia, Bartel was on the high 
school's varsity volleyball team and served as student government secretary her 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic Reaction 
</P>
<P>
For 17-year-old Mouneimne, a computer science buff and member of the Explorers' 
Post at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, the weeklong experience was 
an eye-opener. 
</P>
<P>
Calling it a "a once-in-a-lifetime chance," he said the experience was well 
worth the $800 for air fare, room and board -- which he paid for with savings 
and help from his parents 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I came here is so I can learn about things not directly related to 
computer science," Mouneimne said. "I feel I have an obligation as a citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Mouneimne graduated from La Canada High School and plans to study computer 
science at USC this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Eng, 18, a graduate of South Pasadena High School, where he was the student 
body's commissioner for academics and a student representative to the school 
board, will attend Seton Hall University in New Jersey. He wants to be a 
lawyer. And he got some practice at the conference, where he was able to play 
the role of a defense attorney during a group debate over capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"We're learning hands-on stuff that you can't learn in a book," Eng said. 
</P>
<P>
After the conference, he was scheduled to begin a two-week internship with the 
Governmental National Mortgage Assn. office, which is under the jurisdiction of 
the department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real experience," Eng said of his week on Capitol Hill. "I'll 
remember it forever."

PASADENA SCHOOLS CHIEF TO RETIRE FROM DISTRICT POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phillip B. Jordan, who has been superintendent of the Pasadena Unified School 
District since 1985, has announced he will retire in January. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said he will be 59 and will have spent 35 years in education by the 
beginning of next year. His wife has already retired. She was a teacher in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to retire seemed to catch the school board by surprise, Jordan 
said, even though he had told board members when he was hired that he would not 
stay more than four years. The board has not yet begun to discuss selection of 
a successor. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said he plans to continue living in Pasadena and to spend more time with 
his family, which includes six children and six grandchildren. Before he was 
hired in Pasadena, Jordan was superintendent of one of eight administrative 
regions in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Jordan said he might 
consider working as an educational consultant after he has spent six months in 
retirement.

ZAN THOMPSON: EXITING THE COMPUTER WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am no longer in the parade. I have dropped out. I plan to turn in my uniform 
and they can retire my number. This is voluntary. I have simply come to the 
cold conclusion that I cannot cope with automation and computers and their 
clacking retinues. 
</P>
<P>
I first knew that I would soon be heading back to the field house some time 
ago, when they started to play music into the telephone after the tape that 
says, "All our operators are busy now. Do not hang up or you will lose your 
turn. Your call will be answered in the order in which it was received." 
</P>
<P>
One election day, I telephoned an insurance company and on the tape March Fong 
Eu, Secretary of State of California, sternly reminded me to vote. 
</P>
<P>
This most recent annoyance came over the telephone, as well. My computer and 
its accompanying printer are 5 years old and cost more than $6,000. Recently, I 
called and asked the computer store about a tic it seemed to have developed. 
The man gave a pitying laugh and said, "That equipment is so old they don't 
even make parts for it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
I called my good friend, Craig Hodges, whom I have known since he was a 
sophomore at Occidental College. He was graduated a year ago and works for a 
large company, but he still comes over and unsnarls the computer when I call 
him. 
</P>
<P>
He told me I needed printer ribbons and suggested that I call an 800 number 
belonging to the very big computer company from which I bought the thing. The 
company, Craig said, would take my parts order over the telephone and charge it 
to a credit card number. 
</P>
<P>
I dialed the number and it was one of those recorded messages that makes me 
twitch like a squirrel: "If you want to order, press 3 NOW." Of course if you 
don't have a push-button telephone, you cannot do business with companies like 
this. 
</P>
<P>
One of the instructions gave me a number to push if I were a business. I pushed 
that number because I am self-employed as a free-lance writer and even the IRS 
admits it. 
</P>
<P>
Then a woman answered and asked, "What kind of business is this?" 
</P>
<P>
"I write a column for the Los Angeles Times." 
</P>
<P>
"What is your business address?" 
</P>
<P>
I gave her my home address and she asked me the address of The Times. I gave it 
to her and she said, "But you do not have an address at the Los Angeles Times?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, because I send my copy to my editor on a modem, which lives in the 
computer for which I need a ribbon for the wheel center." That was the first 
time I had got that in. Then she asked, "How did you get this number?" in an 
accusing tone as if I had misrepresented myself in order to get the secret 
number. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to hang up now because we are making no progress, so goodby," I 
said. "Oh, please don't hang up," she cried in the first natural tones I had 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
"I must indicate to the computer that you do not care to answer the questions." 
</P>
<P>
"Be brave," I said heartily, and hung up. 
</P>
<P>
I called the 800 number again and this time I said my computer was personal and 
we started with another woman and another set of questions. She asked, "Does 
this include printed material?" 
</P>
<P>
I explained that I had no idea because it was my fondest wish that she send me 
something and I had no idea if it included printed material or perhaps a peanut 
butter sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
When she asked me sternly what my order would be used for, I answered: "I am 
going to write illiterate material, full of misspelled words, incorrect 
punctuation and incomplete sentences and scatter it on the playgrounds of 
reading clinics." 
</P>
<P>
After a silence, she finally asked, "Would you like the address and telephone 
number of a place you can buy the item number you asked for?" 
</P>
<P>
I told her yes. She then gave me two store names and telephone numbers and we 
hung up. 
</P>
<P>
Both telephone numbers she had given me for the store in Pasadena were answered 
by a tape that said, "The number you have dialed is no longer in service. 
Please dial the number again or ask your operator for assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Do you think I should call her back and tell her the stores on her list have 
collapsed? They probably self-destructed after talking to the home office.

ON VIEW: DESIGNER SHOW LENDS HAND TO THIEVES MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why was Oscar de la Renta gracing the UCLA Art Council with his handsome 
presence and a view of his Fall 1989 Collection on the lawn at Hotel Bel-Air? 
He mused, "Well, Betsy Bloomingdale." Said Betsy: "Did he say that? How nice. 
Well, my daughter Lisa (Bell) is very involved with the council's Thieves 
Market." 
</P>
<P>
Saks Fifth Avenue hosted the event and underwrote everything. The elegant De la 
Renta, tanned from salmon fishing on the Cascapidian in Quebec, brought along 
his friend, Annette Reed, for the show, which was designed to boost the revival 
of the Thieves Market to be held Oct. 27-28 at Santa Monica Airport Center. 
That's the one co-chairs Marian Mandel and Muriel Simkin are pounding the 
pavement for, collecting antiques, memorabilia, art, silver, furs -- everything 
but the sofa. 
</P>
<P>
At the runway-end vantage point, Nancy Mehta, with a patch on her right cheek, 
sat next to Betsy Bloomingdale, Betsy next to Merv Adelson, Merv next to 
Barbara Walters. Fashion doyennes such as Mary Lazar (who hosted a party for 
Oscar and Annette), Patricia Ward, Pat York (with Michael), Helene Irvin (with 
Richard) and Patty Fox gushed over the couture. Gloria Luchenbill sang the 
words to "Begin the Beguine" as the couturier's black velvet dresses sashayed 
on the runway, and when the breeze billowed the chartreuse chiffon gown, she 
gasped: "I want that; I'll take it right now." 
</P>
<P>
Dinner dates followed: A coterie headed for the Bistro Garden, while Bernie and 
Lenny Greenberg and Bob and Laura-Lee Woods chose the Bel-Air dining room, and 
Joan and John Hotchkis with Annette and Peter O'Malley sped to Spago.

Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, knows something about the 
corridors of power. The House Appropriations Committee last week voted to add 
$200,000 for the care of the government mansion occupied by the Quayles -- 
ostensibly because of the personal lobbying by Mrs. Quayle. The genesis of the 
story is tied to Mrs. Quayle's decision to convert storage space into a bath 
and bedrooms for her three children. Her efforts to secure the necessary funds, 
however, were directed not at Budget Director Richard G. Darman but rather at 
Aubrey (Tex) Gunnels, 71, staff director of an appropriations subcommittee, who 
was personally invited to the mansion to review her plans, the Congressional 
Quarterly reported. Although denying that Mrs. Quayle had made a formal request 
for the money, Denise Balzano, Mrs. Quayle's chief of staff, said: "It looks 
like (Gunnels) has been helpful."

 -- "In a sense, the story of the British monarchy is a glorious 
1,000-year-long soap opera, a 'Dynasty' and 'Dallas' put together . . . with 
even more money than Joan Collins." That's Michele Brown's opinion and as 
curator of the Royal Britain exhibition in London, she should be heard. But 
judging by a Gallup survey, most Britons are being turned off by the 
long-running soap opera. Eight out of 10 people, for instance, do not know that 
George III was the last British monarch to rule over America. Forty percent of 
men versus 28% of women knew that Charles I was the only monarch beheaded, 
while 71% of women versus 55% of men correctly named Prince William, eldest son 
of Prince Charles, as first in line to the throne after his father. The survey 
of 971 people was intended to help evaluate the exhibition's worth as a 
purveyor of information. Brown said: "I think it's riveting to know that it was 
George II who died on the lavatory back in 1760."

 -- For Billy Graham, it was a different time, and, seemingly, a different 
place. The globe-trotting evangelist took Budapest, Hungary, by storm, as a 
crowd of 90,000 believers and the curious packed an open-air stadium to hear 
his sermon. Graham, 70, making his first visit to Hungary in 12 years, offered 
veiled praise for the political reforms currently under way in the Soviet Bloc 
country. "Here in Hungary, you are beginning a new life," he said. "Things are 
changing." But he warned: "If you go on with your alcoholism and breakup of the 
family and the suicide rate, you could soon bring this country to an end." 
Hungary leads the world in suicides and has one of the highest rates of divorce 
and alcohol abuse. JAMES MARNELL

STANDING OUT IN JAPAN;

<P>
WOMEN HAVE BEGUN TO CRACK THE TRADITIONAL MALE-DOMINATED CORPORATE CULTURE BUT 
THE GOING CAN BE TOUGH.

<P>
When Mie Teno was hired to help a major Japanese company establish a U.S. 
plant, she went about the project just as any Japanese man would. She quietly 
cultivated allies at all levels of the corporate bureaucracy, beginning with 
the section chiefs and working her way to the vice presidents. Finally, with 
the consensus of all of them, her recommendations went to the top. 
</P>
<P>
Teno worried that her effectiveness might be diminished because she happened to 
be a woman. But she soon knew that the president was sold on the U.S. plant: He 
entertained her at a posh restaurant in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Instances of businessmen entertaining Japanese female executives are virtually 
unheard of in this country, where women are typically relegated to the role of 
"office ladies" who serve tea to their male bosses and colleagues in addition 
to their clerical duties. 
</P>
<P>
Teno is one of the few Japanese executive women making it in male-dominated 
corporate Japan. "Japanese top management is very reluctant to take women 
within their companies, but they are willing to work with women," explained the 
45-year-old consultant who heads her own firm, Deltapoint International Ltd., a 
joint venture with a Bellevue, Wash., company. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of women executives like Teno are slowly making their way in the 
corporate world. Most head their own businesses. Many prefer working for 
foreign firms because they offer better opportunities. Japanese companies only 
recently lifted discriminatory hiring practices against women and now allow 
them to take management-track jobs, once reserved exclusively for men. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Assertiveness 
</P>
<P>
The idea of high-ranking women in business is at odds with the traditional 
image of Japanese women as supportive homebodies whose primary concern is the 
care of their husbands and children. But this self-sacrificing image is 
unraveling among modern Japanese women such as Socialist Party Chairwoman 
Takako Doi, the first woman in Japanese history to head a major political 
party. 
</P>
<P>
She effectively rallied women, who showed a new assertiveness in recent 
elections. Women exhibited stunning political clout last Sunday in helping to 
defeat candidates of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has been embroiled in 
political scandals and also initiated an unpopular 3% consumption tax. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat caused Prime Minister Sosuke Uno to resign. Earlier this month, 
Japan's Agriculture Secretary Hisao Horinouchi had to make a public apology for 
saying a women's place is in the home. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Japan is offering new alternatives to women. "My thinking is quite 
different than the Japanese thinking," said Mieko Hirabayashi, director of 
Spazio Design Associates, a Tokyo design and business consulting company. "I 
never say marriage and making a family is that important. It is part of my 
life, but not my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
Today, women account for 39.9% of Japan's work force, but a third of those 
female workers are part-time or contract workers. Women hold very few corporate 
positions, according to a survey by Tokyo Shogo Research Ltd. They headed only 
3.7% of the 376,800 small companies surveyed. Of the top 100 companies (by 
sales) headed by women, 73 succeeded their fathers or husbands because of death 
or illness, and 19 were founded by women. 
</P>
<P>
Still, bucking the deeply ingrained traditional roles of women is not easy. 
Japanese companies may have earned international kudos for their quality and 
productivity, but women have long been nudged out of their jobs after they 
marry and have children. Equality in the workplace did not become legally 
mandated in Japan until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Projected Labor Shortage 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, when Chizuko Nara went on her first interviews with Japanese 
companies, "They would ask me 'would you be all right if you had to stay late 
to work with other men? Could you find your way home all right?' Maybe it had 
to do with my being so young." 
</P>
<P>
Nara, now 33, went to the United States instead, where she earned an MBA at the 
Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University. She worked for 
Nomura Securities in New York before moving to Tokyo to become a vice president 
in Japanese Equity Research at Salomon Bros. Asia Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Working to the advantage of women, who account for more than one-third of 
Japan's college graduates, is demographics. "Women will play a greater role 
because of a projected labor shortage," said Charlotte A. Kennedy-Takahashi, 
president of Oak Associates, a Tokyo-based human resources company. "There are 
already two jobs for every college graduate. By 1991, there will be five jobs 
for every college graduate." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Japanese women seeking managerial or executive positions find 
employment at foreign firms more attractive. IBM Japan, for example, has been 
the No. 1 choice for the past five years among female graduates seeking 
employment, according to an annual employment survey by Recruit Co. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the foreign firms have given more opportunity to women, partly because 
there has been a shortage of men," explained Kennedy-Takahashi, an American who 
has lived in Japan for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bilingual and Bicultural 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government and companies typically snap up the top male graduates 
from the country's prestigious universities and colleges. Until recently, a 
stigma attached to job hopping and nonconformity forced men to seek lifetime 
employment at Japanese firms. 
</P>
<P>
"If one had gone to work for an international company, it was seen as outside 
of the Establishment," explained Nara at Salomon Bros. "It is still very 
difficult to get Japanese men who are very experienced, in their 30s or 40s or 
50s, to work at American companies or any foreign firm," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of Japan's financial markets to foreign companies in 1985 "opened a 
big, big road" for women, according to Nara. Many of the women who went to work 
for U.S. banks and financial companies were bilingual and bicultural, having 
been educated abroad while their brothers were forced to stay in Japan to get 
the domestic education that Japanese firms traditionally prefer. 
</P>
<P>
Hirabayashi at Spazio, for example, lived in Flushing, N.Y., for five years and 
returned to Japan at age 18 when her father was transferred back home. Nara, 
who spent many years abroad because her father was in the Japanese diplomatic 
corps, earned an undergraduate degree in international relations and business 
and economics at Pomona College. 
</P>
<P>
"With women, foreign banks have found that they have tapped a rich vein that 
has been overlooked in Japan," said Robert L. Sharp, vice president of Asian 
corporate banking at Manufacturers Hanover's office in Los Angeles. "We get an 
awful lot of ladies who are well educated, bright and do great work. About 
two-thirds of our staff are female. That has been very good for us," said 
Sharp, who worked at the bank's Tokyo office for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Other women have created their own niches in the business world. When Teno 
returned to Japan after working for three years at the United Nations in New 
York, she did not fit into any employment category at a Japanese firm. One 
major Japanese company, however, referred her to the Tokyo office of A. T. 
Kearney International, a U.S. consulting company, where she worked for 14 
years, working her way up to become a vice president. She left to form 
Deltapoint International. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Background Hinders 
</P>
<P>
Mariko Fujiwara, who lived in the United States for 12 years and earned a 
degree in anthropology from Stanford, returned to Japan in 1981 with an 
academic background that made her hard to place in corporate Japan. She began 
work with the Hakuhodo Institute of Life &amp; Living, a research arm of the 
Hakuhodo advertising agency, where she now oversees projects on a contract 
basis. "With someone with my background, it is not possible to work full time, 
male or female, it wouldn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
Women have a long -- and hard -- way to go. Japanese women, like foreigners, 
face some formidable challenges in working in Japan's closed and clubby 
business circles where much business is generated by personal relationships and 
transacted after-hours over drinks. 
</P>
<P>
When Hirabayashi worked as an account executive for McCann Erickson-Hakuhodo, 
the advertising agency, she was one of many assigned to the Asahi beer account. 
She dutifully visited the client every day, had meetings in the evenings at 
least twice a week, chatted and drank beer. 
</P>
<P>
However, she soon realized that some business relationships were beyond her 
control. "My boss' niece was sent to marry the Asahi's boss' son." She switched 
to a firm that is partly owned by an Italian company. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman left a Japanese firm to join Citicorp a year ago. At the Japanese 
company she had been one of the few women hired in sogo shoku, the 
predominantly male employment category that is the track to management. 
Although the Japanese company had told her that she was of equal status with 
her male counterparts, she received secondary assignments in support roles to 
the men. 
</P>
<P>
Working among Japanese men also means matching their long hours, and many women 
headed up the corporate ladder have and continue to make personal trade-offs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Sacrifices 
</P>
<P>
"Working in Japan as an executive, male or female, you have to make quite a bit 
of sacrifices," said Yoko Ishida, 37, a vice president at Citicorp Japan's 
investment banking division in Tokyo. "If you want to compete, you have to work 
late. . . . It is difficult for women, especially if they are married. 
Fortunately, my husband is sort of used to it." Ishida, who has no children, 
began her career in the clerical staff, or ippan shoku as it is known in 
Japanese, at Bank of America's Tokyo office 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"An executive woman must be someone who has the ability to be dedicated to the 
company," observed Hirabayashi, 34, who is single. "Even now I hire someone to 
clean once a week. I can't take care of myself. How can I take care of a 
husband or baby?" 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, these few executive women are developing a certain business style 
that may be unique in its indirectness and perceived as unassertive from a 
Western perspective. Few will directly confront or take issue with their 
Japanese colleagues; it's not the Japanese way, they say. "The American image 
of aggressive is forward, mannish," explained Nara at Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Part of this indirectness stems from the Japanese business culture in general. 
Decisions are made by consensus and a substantial amount of information 
gathering is done on an informal basis. "To a large extent professional women 
in Japan are still proving themselves," explained Shirley Lichti, program 
manager of international marketing at IBM Asia/Pacific Group and president of a 
Tokyo group called Foreign Executive Women. "To take a Western approach would 
be career suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Hirabayashi's consulting work demonstrates some of this indirectness. "If I 
have a meeting, my client wants to do something and I feel what he is saying is 
not correct, I would not say it straight out. I would try to understand why he 
came to that conclusion, is it the character of the company? If I feel it is 
possible to change the situation, I will try. After the meeting, I'll have 
dinner or a drink to find out what he is thinking. Those indirect things are 
the basic ways of how to do business. I always remind myself not to be too 
aggressive or too direct. It is part of the culture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Task 
</P>
<P>
Skirting two cultures is a daily task for Ishida, who uses a different style 
when dealing with American business associates than she does with Japanese 
businessmen. "I think and act like an American when I'm with American 
colleagues. I switch to the Japanese mode when I'm with Japanese companies. You 
have to do that to gain credibility. In Japan, we're more subtle in expressing 
our ideas. If I become too direct, I could be offending that person. . . . It 
is very different." 
</P>
<P>
Even when it comes to serving tea, Japanese women on the managerial track might 
do it. "Serving tea doesn't mean so much to me," explained Hirabayashi. "It's a 
question of hierarchy, not gender." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy-Takahashi describes the style of Japanese female executives as "quiet 
modesty. If they have been successful, they do not act aggressively. It's a 
quiet managing. . . . A lot of Japanese women did it by being soft -- by being 
softly aggressive -- that means they were thinking ahead, being there at the 
right moment with the information at the right time . . . maneuvering. The 
American concept is to get in there and push your name. Successful Japanese 
women scare me. I get a feeling of the incredible ability to manipulate. A 
woman who harnesses that is deadly." 
</P>
<P>
Teno exudes this quiet confidence. Her busy schedule has her out to business 
dinners or lunches two or three times a week. "My policy is that I don't eat 
alone," she explained in her Tokyo office decorated with expensive cut class 
and crystal. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing business in Japan, you have to be in a responsible position. You have to 
be high-ranking and confident, " she explained. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all their achievements, which are considerable in slow-changing Japan, 
the new generation of executive women does not like the phrase "executive 
women" because it attracts too much attention. 
</P>
<P>
Nara at Salomon Bros. explained: "I don't like the term executive women. I feel 
it is unnecessary. It places emphasis on what I've done because I'm a woman. I 
don't think that is necessary. It draws extra attention. It increases the 
difference that is already there." 
</P>
<P>
Hirabayashi summarized her feelings: "Executive woman sounds like a woman who 
has given up a lot of things to have a career."

THE EVOLUTION OF PC FAX; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES BUT BUGS PERSIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Technology buffs long considered facsimile a stone-age invention, a tawdry 
substitute for the real computer communications that would help bring about the 
"paperless office." 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere along the way, the paperless office got buried beneath an unexpected 
avalanche of faxes. But the very success of fax has spurred the development of 
a set of computer-based fax products that may help fulfill the elusive promise 
of effortless electronic communications. 
</P>
<P>
The principle behind the basic PC fax board is simple: Install one in a 
personal computer or on a computer network, and you can receive a fax and print 
it out. Or you can do the reverse, sending off anything in your computer to a 
remote fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
Computer-generated fax also boasts better resolution than regular fax. The 
notorious "junk-fax" generators, who send advertising to thousands of fax 
machines at a time, truly appreciate the PC fax's capacity for sending multiple 
copies automatically. PC fax, indeed, can be a boon for all those who, by 
choice or chance, do most of their work on a PC. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Versions Complicated 
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly, the important information we need to do our jobs will be on a 
PC, and if you want to share that with someone, you'd want to do it by pushing 
a few buttons," said Richard Gough, manager for communications products at 
Intel's personal computer group. "We're very bullish on the fax board 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
This all sounds nice, though in fact things are not yet so simple. Fax boards 
in their early incarnations -- and they've only been around for about three 
years -- violated the basic principle that made fax so successful: ease of use. 
Some products required a string of cumbersome commands to operate, as opposed 
to the crude simplicity of sticking a piece of paper into a machine. 
</P>
<P>
And sending a paper document by PC fax isn't very practical, as it requires an 
expensive document scanner. Furthermore, when a fax is received in a PC, it can 
only be viewed or printed out. The computer can't actually work with the data 
without an expensive software program called an optical character reader. 
That's because a fax is a graphics file, a literal representation of the 
physical appearance of a page, rather than a data file in which letters and 
numbers are stored as computer bits. 
</P>
<P>
The result of these shortcomings? "PC fax is pretty much a drop in the bucket 
right now," according to Judy Pirani, a market researcher with the firm BIS CAP 
International. Just 40,000 fax boards were installed last year, she said, 
compared to 1.125 million fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
But help has arrived and more is on the way. Major electronics companies such 
as Intel, Hayes and AT&amp;T have stirred themselves to the potential of PC 
fax, and a new set of advanced products is emerging that makes PC fax much 
easier to use and vastly extends its functions. 
</P>
<P>
PC users who invest $500 to $1,000 in a fax package can now get easy-to-use 
systems that operate automatically, without disturbing other computer 
operations, and provide a variety of special features. PC fax, in fact, will 
soon have most of the characteristics of that technologist's dream, electronic 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
"As a universal electronic mail system, fax already exists," observed Hugh 
Mackworth, marketing vice president at Palo Alto-based Gammalink, a pioneer of 
personal computer fax. "Every business has access to a fax machine, so everyone 
now has an electronic mail address." 
</P>
<P>
Conceptually, Mackworth said, the company now regards fax machines not as 
stand-alone devices, but as "remote printers and scanners for computers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need Same Board 
</P>
<P>
For PC fax to be a real full-service electronic mail system, though, what's 
still needed is a way to transfer documents between two computer faxes in a 
format that allows them to be edited (or massaged, as data junkies like to put 
it), just like any other computer files. Philip Begosian, chairman of a key fax 
standards committee and manager of software development at Milpitas, 
Calif.-based Xecom, explained that while some fax boards permit this type of 
direct file transfer, such capabilities work only if both parties have the same 
brand of board. 
</P>
<P>
That situation, however, is changing. "Every company had recognized the 
significance of file transfer, but they realized they were not benefiting from 
it and had to get together to decide how to implement it," Begosian explained. 
The result was a recent agreement on a U.S. standard for file transfer among PC 
faxes, which vendors are expected to incorporate into products beginning this 
fall. In contrast to traditional PC-to-PC linkups using modems, which require 
the would-be correspondents to fiddle with various settings and hope for the 
best, fax file transfers will be as easy and reliable as fax. 
</P>
<P>
An arriving document might even come with a message that flashes across the 
receiver's screen, alerting him to the contents. "This is exactly the type of 
activity that is going to provide a platform for this market to develop," said 
Garry Betty, vice president for sales at Hayes, the large modem company that 
recently purchased the technology of market leader JT Fax. "The keys to the 
development are going to be software and standards." 
</P>
<P>
File transfer, moreover, is not the only innovation that will make fax more of 
a full-function communications tool. Work continues on further additions to the 
so-called Group 3 fax standard that will eventually allow higher speeds, error 
correction, better resolution and serial ports to connect fax machines with 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Firms Involved 
</P>
<P>
With these innovations, it's not surprising that PC fax boards are no longer 
the exclusive province of obscure Silicon Valley enterprises. Intel, the big 
semiconductor company, has gotten into the game with a widely admired fax 
board, AT&amp;T now has a fax product, and even IBM sells PC fax devices that 
it buys from Gammalink. These firms are expecting broad interest in 
computer-based fax in the corporate world, where the devices can be installed 
in computer networks or large computer systems and used by many people. 
</P>
<P>
And as the boards proliferate, so will the possible uses. Gough described a new 
24-hour-a-day service in which Intel customers seeking technical information 
can call a phone number, follow a series of synthetic voice commands, punch in 
numbers on the telephone and get an Intel PC to automatically fax the needed 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
Dataquest, a market research firm, expects that fax boards will account for 15% 
of the total fax market by 1993, against just 3.6% today. So 15% of those 
greasy faxes that are now cluttering desktops will sit neatly in computer 
files. Not quite a paperless office, perhaps, but it's a start.

FINANCIER DESMOND'S VISION FOR IRELAND FAR-REACHING; 
</P>
<P>
SEES HIS COUNTRY AS THE JUMPING-OFF POINT TO UNIFIED EUROPE FOR BUSINESSES IN 
1990S

DUBLIN, Ireland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some countries are blessed with oil, iron ore or even diamonds. But Ireland's 
natural resources are its people and its educational system, says Dermot 
Desmond. 
</P>
<P>
All right, the acknowledged Wunderkind of Irish finance will concede when 
pressed, that maybe its blarney should be mentioned, too. 
</P>
<P>
But if blarney used to symbolize a sort of quiet, disarming native charm, the 
hyperactive, 38-year-old Desmond represents a new, concentrated brand for the 
hard-sell, fast-paced Europe of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the unified European market planned for 1992, Desmond, the 
executive chairman of Dublin's NCB Group Ltd., said: "We see a number of 
non-European companies that will want to market their financial services on the 
continent. Ireland should be the bridgehead for these companies." 
</P>
<P>
It was Desmond who first promoted the idea of transforming the seedy docklands 
section of Dublin into a new, international financial services center scheduled 
to open this fall. The 65 tenants already signed up include Irish and a range 
of foreign firms -- from America's Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Bank to Japan's 
Daiwa Bank and West Germany's Dresdener Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Desmond's influence extends well beyond that project, however: A few weeks ago, 
he became chairman of the newly created Irish Futures and Options Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
While claiming no interest in politics himself, he has also been a key economic 
adviser to Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey and his Fianna Fail (Soldiers 
of Destiny) political party during the country's remarkable economic resurgence 
of the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
In concert with two other center-right parties, Haughey has slashed government 
spending, cut foreign debt and brought a seemingly chronic double-digit 
inflation rate down to 3%. 
</P>
<P>
"Desmond is credited with converting the Fianna Fail leadership, and Charlie 
Haughey specifically, after the (1987) election into taking this tougher 
economic line," noted Terence J. Baker, senior research officer at Dublin's 
Economic and Social Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
"He's somebody who has the ear of the Taoiseach (prime minister). There's no 
doubt about that," confirmed a government official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. And an Irish journalist said Desmond can occasionally be seen 
slipping into Haughey's office around noon for a brown-bag lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed in the offices of his stock brokerage and corporate finance firm in 
Dublin, Desmond would say of his relationship with Haughey only that "I'd be an 
admirer of him -- of his national commitment. . . . We can have a kind of 
non-presidential communication." 
</P>
<P>
A smoker and fidgeter, Desmond has the appearance of a man in a hurry. When he 
was not talking during a recent interview, his foot bounced in time with some 
incessant inner tempo. Admirers describe him as "bright," "lively," even 
"charismatic." Critics call him a self-promoter. 
</P>
<P>
He founded National City Brokers as a foreign exchange and currency deposit 
agency in 1981 after several years of working first for Citibank in Dublin, 
then as a World Bank adviser to the government of Afghanistan in Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, his firm bought a small Dublin stock brokerage and became the NCB 
Group. The closely held company has since grown into one of the country's 
largest stock, bond and corporate finance firms. 
</P>
<P>
Married and the father of four, Desmond is acutely aware of the continuing 
emigration of Irish youth in search of the economic opportunities that this 
country has never seemed able to provide. His dream, he said, is "to see kids 
grow up in a country they're proud of and which has opportunities for them to 
work in." 
</P>
<P>
The Europe of 1992 offers Ireland a unique chance, Desmond believes. With 
trading barriers scheduled to come down, the incentive is for firms to 
centralize their European operations, and Ireland has specific attractions for 
financial services companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Desmond ticked off Dublin's selling points: It is located within the same 
advantageous time zone as London, permitting communication with all the world's 
major financial centers during waking hours. English is the language of 
finance, and Ireland's highly regarded educational system is the source of a 
potentially superior work force. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland has a new and efficient telecommunications system and, to sweeten the 
deal, the government has instituted what is reputed to be the most generous 
collection of tax breaks for foreign investors offered by any European Economic 
Community member. 
</P>
<P>
On top of everything else, Desmond said, Dublin offers what some would consider 
a superior, less costly and certainly less congested life style than 
alternatives such as London. 
</P>
<P>
With the first building in the new International Financial Services Center due 
to open in September, Desmond said there are as many more firms applying for 
licenses as have already signed up. The plan now calls for 500,000 square feet 
of space in the center, compared to the original 300,000, he added. 
</P>
<P>
And if you think that's blarney, Desmond said, you're wrong. "All the blarney 
in the world won't convince any of these financial firms to come in," he 
explained. "The blarney we use is reinforcing the truth."

FOREIGN WOMEN DON'T FARE MUCH BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Foreign executive women in Japan have an easier time, but not much. 
</P>
<P>
They face fewer of the outright biases against women, partly because most work 
for foreign firms. But still, foreign executive women are not treated the same 
as foreign executive men. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a difference between a foreign female executive and foreign male 
executive. There is a lot of inequality built into the system from what I've 
seen," explained Shirley Lichti, program manager of international marketing at 
IBM Asia/Pacific Group in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Lichti, the newly elected president of Foreign Executive Women (FEW), a group 
of 150 expatriate women working in Japan, said Japanese businessmen will not 
negotiate directly with foreign women on big deals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Break Rules 
</P>
<P>
"That's why people were really shocked when Carla Hills (U.S. Trade 
Representative) was given the job to negotiate the Super 301" trade agreement 
with the Japanese. "Japanese businessmen never negotiate anything that is 
important with a woman. . . . This society changes slowly. It takes forever to 
change the mind-set." 
</P>
<P>
Still, foreign executive women receive better treatment than their Japanese 
counterparts because as foreigners, or gaijin, they are outside of the system 
and are not subject to Japanese traditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Caucasian women achieve a male status in a company in Japan. They become 
androgynous so they are treated differently than domestic Japanese women," 
explained Takie S. Lebra, a professor of anthropology at the University of 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"We're foreigners; we don't fit into the cultural framework," explained Sharman 
Knox, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover in Tokyo. "We're much more 
fluid. . . . We can approach much more senior people than Japanese females." 
</P>
<P>
Not being Japanese allowed Jane Waugh, who has worked in Japan twice and was 
one of the founders of FEW, to break some rules. When she was selling 
advertising for an English-language magazine, she hopped on her motor bike to 
make unsolicited sales calls. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese would never do that -- make cold calls -- because you had to have 
a proper introduction," said Waugh, who now works at Prodigy Services Co. in 
Stamford, Conn. "A foreigner could get away with doing strange things like that 
that Japanese women could not." But she noted that when she first went to Japan 
in 1979, the Japanese government required a letter from her husband permitting 
her to work, among other documents, before issuing her a work permit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Token Hiring 
</P>
<P>
"With foreign women, the shock appeal is useful to get in the door," explained 
Robert L. Sharp, vice president of Asian corporate banking at Manufacturers 
Hanover's office in Los Angeles. But he added, "the bottom line is are you 
competent? You could be a female giraffe, as long as you've got the goods to 
produce, but whether they (the Japanese) prefer a giraffe is another matter." 
</P>
<P>
There also is some question about whether a few Japanese firms have hired 
foreign women in high positions as window dressing -- a token symbol of 
internationalization. "There is a real push by Japanese firms toward 
internationalization, but their thinking is that hiring a gaijin will do it," 
explained Lichti, whose group meets often with the Japan Assn. of Female 
Executives. 
</P>
<P>
She said one American woman left a very prestigious Japanese firm because "they 
didn't give her anything to do. She left and went to a foreign company."

PAMPERED PETS; 
</P>
<P>
FOR GREAT DANES OR GOLDFISH, TRADE SHOW HAS EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In booths that held dazzling displays of high-powered hair dryers, 
stew-flavored bones and other pet products, manufacturers welcomed retailers 
who carried shopping bags. The only animal in sight, except for fish in 
aquariums, was a poodle in a polka-dot dress. 
</P>
<P>
The poodle and its owner, designer Patricia Henderson of Silk-N-Satin pet 
fashions, also wearing a polka-dot dress, were of little professional interest 
to Claire Sanford of Whittier at the pet industry's annual trade show at the 
Long Beach Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a specialty, something for people who live in Beverly Hills," Sanford 
said. The owner of a tropical-fish store, Sanford is changing to dogs and cats, 
and looked mostly for cages as she walked among the 400 exhibits last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But, like everyone else, Sanford laughed as Henderson dressed her poodle, GiGi, 
in outfits to match the clothes of pet owners. The little dog posed calmly, but 
upon hearing a squeak, GiGi -- clad perhaps in a flowery Hawaiian number 
through which her tail vibrated wildly -- would scamper away and disappear into 
a toy booth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mink Coats for Parrots 
</P>
<P>
Although Henderson, attending the trade show from Colonia, N.J., had no bird 
models, she told prospective buyers that she also enjoys making imitation mink 
coats for parrots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy," she explained. "You have to cut the coat in a certain way so 
they can move their wings." 
</P>
<P>
The trade show was held in Long Beach, not only for its convenient location, 
said Thomas McLaughlin, executive vice president of the Western World Pet 
Supply Assn., but "because we're largely a family industry, and there are a lot 
of things for a family to do here." 
</P>
<P>
Sanford, who has a cat, dog, turtle, tarantula, tortoise and frog at home, 
called herself a typical pet person. "It's a nice business," she said. "Most of 
the people you meet are nice. You get few bad checks." 
</P>
<P>
Although boutique companies such as Henderson's have been entering the 
industry, most of the exhibitors showed the basic equipment required by 
operators of pet shops, grooming shops and feed stores. 
</P>
<P>
There were colorful arrays of bowls, collars and leashes; scientific-looking 
displays of flea-fighting shampoos and medications, and pyramids of natural dog 
food and low-ash cat food. 
</P>
<P>
As he pointed out the exhibits, McLaughlin offered some observations: 
</P>
<P>
"We call (pets) 'companion animals' -- that's the term coming into the 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty percent of the pet industry's sales are in California." 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago there were twice as many dogs as cats in the United States, 
but now there are 55 million cats and 52 million dogs. That has to be caused by 
more people moving into condominiums and apartments, and (because) cats are 
easier to keep." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yuppie Puppy Treet 
</P>
<P>
But products for dogs still have an audience. At the Carousel Industries booth, 
Patti Page appeared on a television screen to sing "How Much Is That Doggie in 
the Window" to introduce a video promoting the Yuppie Puppy Treet Machine. Next 
to the TV was a gumball-type machine, designed to discharge a snack when a dog 
presses his paw on the bone-shaped handle. 
</P>
<P>
"We're moving them," said salesman Brent Kaplan of Des Plaines, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Though he had no numbers for them, McLaughlin noted that birds and fish are 
rising rapidly in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Since fish are hot, the aquarium people looked confident. 
</P>
<P>
"Fish definitely are the big thing," said Mike Calli, owner of American 
Aquatics Inc. of Paramount, as he stood before a row of softly bubbling tanks. 
"I haven't seen a child yet who isn't super excited about aquariums and fish." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fluorescent Shipwrecks 
</P>
<P>
Aquariums of all sizes, some elaborately housed in tall wood furniture, 
beckoned in almost every aisle. They were filled with living reefs and bright 
fish that once might have lived off Key West. The fish swam among fluorescent 
shipwrecks and sea monsters in clear, clean ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
One company sold not aquariums but videotapes of fish swimming in beautiful 
tropical waters. Set to classical music, the tapes are big with Chicago 
yuppies, said Allen Brelig, president of Petvision of Oak Park, Ill. Colette 
Fairchild, the firm's vice president, mentioned that a study at an Eastern 
university had proved that watching fish can calm people. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend included a dog-grooming contest and seminars on "great business 
ideas" and "managing stress in fish." Saturday night the pet people danced and 
drank beer, rum-and-Cokes and 7-and-7s at a party at the Hyatt Regency Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Over the party's loud music, Richard Peterson, 66, a distributor from Pebble 
Beach, recalled selling horse meat for dog food in the late 1940s. The pet 
industry was just getting started about that time because of a parakeet craze. 
</P>
<P>
"It's come a long way," Peterson said. "It's a great industry, and it's so 
small that I can go from booth to booth and know everybody." 
</P>
<P>
By late Sunday afternoon, the show had begun to wind down. 
</P>
<P>
Over near the dog training videos, one salesman said to another: "Let me out of 
here. I'm out of literature, I'm out of cards." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't the only one ready to call it a day. 
</P>
<P>
GiGi, pooped from two days of posing, lay serenely beneath a display of bird 
hats. She seemed happy, even though she didn't have a stitch on.

SHELTER IS 'PACKED' YEAR AFTER OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 42-year-old man, his wife and two sons made their home in the family car 
and cheap motels before they landed in Norwalk at the Rio Hondo Temporary Home 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The thin man with a faded blue cap and a rose tattoo on his arm asked not to be 
identified because he is embarrassed to be at the shelter for homeless 
families. He works full-time as a packaging and stock clerk, but $6.40 an hour 
doesn't go far. 
</P>
<P>
His wife plans to take a computer course at Cerritos College and then find a 
job to help the family get back on its feet. They left their last permanent 
home, a rented house in South Whittier, about a year and a half ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard with what I make and her not working," he said. "If she gets a job. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 homeless people live with their hopes and dreams at the shelter, 
a two-story building on the tree-lined grounds of Metropolitan State Hospital 
on Norwalk Boulevard north of Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Average 116 Each Night 
</P>
<P>
Business is brisk a year after the shelter opened its doors. An average of 116 
people stayed each night during the fiscal year that ended June 30, according 
to shelter records. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is packed," executive director Michael Elias said. "We have a 
waiting list of people trying to get in." 
</P>
<P>
The Rio Hondo Temporary Home seems to be a world away from the shelters of Los 
Angeles' Skid Row, where the smell of sweat and urine turns back all but the 
most desperate. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening, youths played basketball in the shelter's back yard. Eight 
children got ready to play a variation of hide-and-seek. And a couple of adults 
barbecued. 
</P>
<P>
The 18,659-square-foot shelter contains 27 bedrooms for families and three 
dormitories for single men and women. 
</P>
<P>
The hallways are well lighted and have blue, gray and beige carpeting. A large 
television room with a video recorder adds to the family atmosphere, as does a 
room with children's toys and playpens. 
</P>
<P>
The bedrooms are small and plain. Bathroom and shower facilities are shared. 
There are two kitchens with dining rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Families accounted for about 36% of the shelter's residents in 1988-89, while 
single mothers and their children represent another 30%, according to a shelter 
report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans to Continue Schooling 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Greer, 32, a single mother, arrived in California last month with $110 
in her pocket and her 16-year-old son at her side. A cocktail waitress in 
Savannah, Ga., Greer boarded a bus for South Gate with plans to get a job as a 
secretary and continue her schooling. She ended up at the shelter several days 
later when her money ran out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just looking for a new beginning," Greer said. "I know L.A.'s such a large 
city, someone out there is going to give me a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Elias says the Rio Hondo shelter is different because it gives residents a 
chance to get back on their feet with job counseling and placement programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my personal belief that people must work." Elias said. "This soup-kitchen 
mentality, the handout thing, is abhorrent to me." 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of the residents have been alcoholics or drug addicts, Elias said, or 
have a criminal background that led to homelessness. Others are single mothers 
or the working poor who do not earn enough money to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
About 16% of the families at the shelter have at least one member permanently 
employed. Nearly 20% receive welfare. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless are allowed to stay at the shelter for 60 days. Working singles 
and those who receive welfare must pay $50 a week to defray costs, while 
families stay for free. Residents are required to perform some chores, such as 
cleaning the kitchen or vacuuming the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
New arrivals are given five days to get settled and cope with the reality of 
being homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem is depression," said Frederick LaGrone, 31, who is staying 
at the shelter with his two daughters. "They're lost, just staring into space, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
Adults are required to enter a program that helps them find a job, save money 
and secure their own housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some in Vocational Training 
</P>
<P>
They receive instruction on resume writing, interviewing and other job-hunting 
skills. Some residents enroll in vocational training programs, Elias said. 
</P>
<P>
Once a resident secures a job, he is required to open a bank account and to 
save 50% of each paycheck. Counseling on money management is provided. 
Motivational and other seminars are offered. There is a support group for 
recovered alcoholics and drug users. 
</P>
<P>
There is day-care, summer day camp and a summer employment program for children 
and teen-agers. Nearly 50% of the residents are younger than 18. 
</P>
<P>
The children appear to adjust more easily than adults to group living, 
residents said, but they also have problems. 
</P>
<P>
One 12-year-old boy with a freckled face and pale blue eyes said he makes 
friends with adults because there aren't many youngsters his age at the 
shelter. He said he is often bored and one day would like to live with his 
parents and brother in a home of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to make the best out of what's here," he said. "Who cares if they're 
adults?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Find Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Elias said about 85% of the families and singles who come to the shelter leave 
with a job. In April, May and June, the months for which job statistics were 
available, 46 shelter residents found jobs, according to a shelter report. 
</P>
<P>
Job program director Sheryl Semans said most of the jobs residents find pay $6 
to $12 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Elias and residents said life at the shelter generally runs smoothly. But Elias 
said he occasionally has to kick out residents for drug or alcohol use or 
possession of weapons. A fight erupts now and then, and children squabble. 
</P>
<P>
But the shelter has created no notable law enforcement problems for the state 
hospital, which has its own police force, spokesman Jack Eubanks said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rio Hondo shelter spent about $355,000 in 1988-89 and has budgeted $399,000 
for this year, Elias said. Most of the money comes from the federal government 
and the cities of Downey, Norwalk, Pico Rivera, Santa Fe Springs, Whittier, 
area church groups and civic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Left With Deficit 
</P>
<P>
But the shelter, like its residents, is trying to weather lean times of its 
own, having ended the 1988-89 fiscal year about $30,000 in the red, Elias said. 
</P>
<P>
Elias described the deficit as a cash-flow problem, which he hopes to overcome 
this year through more aggressive fund raising. Shelter officials launched a 
fund-raising campaign earlier this month, asking about 400 past supporters to 
donate $7 a month. 
</P>
<P>
So far, about 30 people have responded with donations or pledges ranging into 
the hundreds of dollars, office manager Betty Shaw said. A La Mirada real 
estate broker has been donating 10% of her commissions to the shelter since 
last fall, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old boy said he is thankful for what those donations provide. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is really nice," he said. "It's better than being in the street. I 
think we're fortunate."

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state health officials are 
considering granting permits to allow two chemical manufacturers in Commerce 
and Lynwood to continue burning hazardous waste in small incinerators they have 
operated for years. 
</P>
<P>
The Ashland Chemical Co., which manufactures resin for molded plastic products 
such as shower stalls and boat hulls, has been burning liquid and gaseous 
wastes since 1974 at a plant on the 6600 block of East 26th Street in Commerce, 
south of the Santa Ana Freeway and west of Garfield Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Cargill Inc. has burned waste gases and water since 1980 in an incinerator at 
its Lynwood plant on the 2800 block of Lynwood Road. Cargill manufactures 
resins that are used in plastic and paint products. 
</P>
<P>
Both plants burn waste that they generate and do not accept outside waste, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permits Required 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has regulated the plants for 
overall smog emissions. But the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
of 1976 and subsequent amendments require the plants to secure permits from the 
EPA and the state Department of Health Services by Nov. 8 if they are to 
continue burning hazardous waste, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Plant officials said it is cheaper to burn the hazardous waste on site rather 
than have it trucked elsewhere for incineration. Ashland plant manager Reid 
Mork said it also avoids some risks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more economical and it's a lot safer because you don't have it traveling 
around on the roads," Mork said last week. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been little public opposition to continued operation of the 
incinerators. 
</P>
<P>
No one spoke in opposition to the permit for the Ashland incinerator during a 
public hearing last Thursday at the South Gate Auditorium. But an aide to 
Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal Allard (D-Los Angeles) submitted a written request 
that a "toxics audit" be made before the permit is issued. Such an audit would 
determine how much incinerator emissions contribute to the overall toxic 
emissions problem in the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Commerce Councilman Ruben C. Batres said he was not aware of 
any objections by city officials to continued operation of the Ashland 
incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only 2 Complaints 
</P>
<P>
During a hearing last month, only two Lynwood residents opposed the permit for 
the Cargill incinerator. One complained of odors from the plant and the other 
said she feared that emissions from the incinerator could be harmful. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood officials do not oppose continued operation of the incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been running since 1980," Lynwood Councilman Robert Henning said in an 
interview. "There have not been any problems in our city in reference to people 
being sick." 
</P>
<P>
Both incinerators have undergone extensive emissions tests to see if they 
comply with EPA and state standards. 
</P>
<P>
The companies hired private contractors to perform the tests, which are 
reviewed by the EPA and state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Cargill is in an industrial pocket on the east end of Lynwood, surrounded by 
residential areas. The incinerator, which burns one to two gallons of liquid 
waste per minute, is about four feet in diameter and 13 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's waste contains resin and other compounds such as dioxane and 
formaldehyde, two suspected cancer-causing agents. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain operating permits, the incinerator must meet emissions standards for 
hydrogen chloride, a gaseous acid, and particulates. It must also be able to 
destroy 99.99% of organic toxic compounds such as dioxane. 
</P>
<P>
Cargill performed a test burn in October, 1988. The plant passed muster for 
hydrogen chloride and particulates but failed to destroy the hazardous 
compounds at the required 99.99% level, according to an EPA report. 
</P>
<P>
Some modifications were made to the incinerator and another test burn has since 
been performed, officials said. Results indicate that the plant has met the 
99.99% standard, but they are still under review, said Jim Marxen, spokesman 
for the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary health risk study indicates that the Cargill incinerator would 
create little additional risk of cancer among area residents. The study 
forecast less than one new case of cancer per million people living near the 
plant for 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Ashland Chemical Co. is surrounded by industry. The nearest residence is 
about half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
The Ashland incinerator burns resin, dioxane and formaldehyde. The incinerator 
is about the same size as the Cargill incinerator and burns two gallons of 
liquid waste per minute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inaccuracy Feared 
</P>
<P>
A test burn at Ashland was conducted by private contractors in September, 1988. 
Results indicated that the incinerator met EPA standards for emissions of 
hydrogen chloride and particulates. But testing for organic hazardous compounds 
may have been inaccurate, and Ashland must test again. 
</P>
<P>
A health risk study still under review by the EPA and state health officials 
indicates that emissions from the Ashland incinerator would cause less than one 
new case of cancer among a million people living near the plant for 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ashland will probably be granted a conditional permit in November and be 
required to submit the additional test results in the spring, officials said.

PAPER WORK IS TYING UP POLICE UNIT, STUDY FINDS

<TEXT>
<P>
A state consultant has concluded that the Long Beach Police Department's Crime 
Analysis Unit has become so overloaded with administrative tasks that it does 
not have enough time to provide police on the beat with workable plans to fight 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
"The administrative tasks so overload staff that they have little time to 
support field operations and investigations with tactical crime analysis," 
consultant Lynne Thayer, hired by the Office of Criminal Justice Planning to 
assess the unit, wrote in a June 27 report. "As a result," the report 
continued, "the CAU has had a difficult time establishing credibility with the 
operational units within the department." 
</P>
<P>
David Dusenbury, Long Beach's deputy chief of police and the unit's project 
director, disputed the conclusions in the report. "That's not true," he said. 
"I think we've done lots of tactical crime analysis." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operates With State Grant 
</P>
<P>
The unit began operating in Long Beach two years ago under the Career Criminal 
Apprehension Program with a state grant of $221,950 each year for three years. 
It uses computer technology to pinpoint high-crime areas, to compare methods 
used by suspects, to set priorities for police calls and to track career 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Thayer reported that after the unit's work for one month, she found that 
employees are burdened with doing too many reports for the city manager, the 
City Council and departmental administrators. 
</P>
<P>
But Dusenbury said: "Even though these reports may appear to be administrative, 
they were used for tactical reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Acting Lt. Richard Wood, the unit's project manager, said until more computer 
software is added and the kinks are worked out of the system, much of the work 
has to be done manually. About $55,000 in software is due to be added soon, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The computer system "is not going to just start running a 100-yard-dash in nine 
seconds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thayer also concluded that employees sometimes are overburdened with menial 
tasks, such as drawing charts and graphs and coloring maps. 
</P>
<P>
In responding, Dusenbury said, "Charts, maps and graphs can be very useful. It 
(information) stands right out. We need something that gives us the immediate 
picture." 
</P>
<P>
Thayer refused to elaborate on her report and Joan Chan, the chief deputy 
director of the state office, said that Thayer's conclusions stand on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, the state office commended the department for getting the 
unit started. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Met Our Needs' 
</P>
<P>
"Since they met their objectives, they met our needs," Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
Chan would not compare the unit to others in the state. "Each jurisdiction is 
different, so there is no way to compare," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dusenbury and Wood pointed to the good reviews Thayer gave the unit's Crime 
Information Bulletins, which are distributed to patrol officers two or three 
times a week. The bulletins give information on crime problems, crime patterns, 
investigative leads and wanted persons. The unit has done 228 bulletins since 
it was formed, Wood said. He said that of 90 wanted suspects listed in the 
bulletins, 81 have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Thayer also concluded that the staff, "though highly competent and dedicated, 
shows evidence of high stress and low morale." 
</P>
<P>
But Dusenbury said he does not think Thayer talked to a majority of the staff. 
The unit has four staff members and a secretary, and one position remains to be 
filled. Thayer would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
"What I think we have here is some dissatisfaction by some people in the Crime 
Analysis Unit," Dusenbury said.

MORE CHERNOBYL EVACUEES

<TEXT>

Soviet scientists say 106,000 people should be evacuated from their villages in 
Byelorussia due to contamination from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident, not 
11,000 as the government recommends, the news agency Tass said. The cost of 
such a large resettlement would reach $15.6 billion, well beyond the financial 
capabilities of the republic just north of the power plant, which is in the 
Ukraine, the Byelorussian republic's legislature was told. The estimate exceeds 
the $12.5-billion official figure for the cumulative cost of the Chernobyl 
cleanup. The explosion at the Chernobyl plant resulted in the death of 31 
people and spread radioactive fallout over a wide area.

An angry American Indian family closed what has been a public road, claiming 
that their ancestors never gave Madera County permission to use it. Echo Valley 
Road is the only access to about 100 homes in the Sierra Nevada near Oakhurst. 
Indian heirs of Frank Hammond formed a human barricade across the road and 
asked residents to sign a form absolving them of any liability for injuries 
that might happen on the 1,200-foot stretch they claim. Most residents signed 
the form, but some just drove through, saying that the Hammond heirs were 
legally wrong to try to land lock their properties. County Counsel Jeff Kuhn 
said the county has offered $10,000 for the right-of-way, which has been used 
as a public road since 1961, and is now considering condemnation proceedings to 
reopen the road. The $10,000 offer was called "a slap in the face," by Harold 
Hammond. "This is not about money," he said. "This is about principle. They 
took something from us, and they don't give a damn."

The flight recorders of the Korean Air DC-10 that crashed at Libya's Tripoli 
airport Thursday, killing 78 people, have been found, but it will take time to 
analyze them, a Libyan official said. Seven Libyans on the ground were among 
those killed when the plane with 197 people aboard plowed through houses and 
orchards in thick, early morning mist. Mustafa Maghrebi, head of a Libyan 
commission of inquiry, said that neither Libya nor a visiting team of Korean 
Air experts has the means to interpret the data and voice recordings. There has 
been no report that any malfunction might have caused the second DC-10 disaster 
in nine days.

An Arab suspected of working for Israeli security forces died in the Gaza Strip 
of stab wounds inflicted by a group of Palestinians who claimed they acted on 
behalf of the PLO-backed leadership of the uprising, Palestinian sources said. 
Walid Barud, 23, of the Shati refugee camp near Gaza City was stabbed in the 
Rafah camp and died in Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, the sources said. His 
attackers reportedly left a note attached to his clothing indicating they were 
acting on behalf of the Unified Leadership of the Uprising, which is supported 
by the Palestine Liberation Organization.

A military tribunal in Myanmar, formerly Burma, sentenced seven youths to 
five-year prison terms for staging anti-government demonstrations, a government 
newspaper said. Police arrested the youths for shouting slogans July 17 at a 
Buddhist temple in Yangon, formerly Rangoon, during a religious holiday, the 
Working People's Daily said. In a related development, a spokesman for the main 
opposition party said as many as 1,500 people have been arrested since early 
July. Early last week, another military tribunal ordered the death sentence for 
three young members of the League for Democracy who were convicted of planting 
a package bomb that killed two people at a government oil refinery July 7.

Nicaraguan opposition leaders agreed to open talks with the Sandinista 
government next Thursday to discuss conditions for free and fair general 
elections in February. The government offered to start a dialogue with 
delegates of 21 legally registered parties, including the Opposition National 
Union, the main opposition alliance made up of 14 parties. Opposition proposals 
will include reforms of the electoral laws and the role of the media in the 
campaign, a right to vote for exiles, a general amnesty for all political 
prisoners, and a number of others.

Hydraulic system failures affected landings by two American Airlines jets, a 
DC-10 carrying 297 people to Dallas and a Boeing 727 carrying 34 passengers and 
crew members to Rochester, N.Y. Backup systems took over in both cases and no 
injuries were reported, officials said. Airport emergency personnel and the 
Rochester Fire Department lined the runway as the 727 touched down at Greater 
Rochester International Airport. American Airlines spokesman James Brown said 
one of three hydraulic systems of the plane failed en route from the 
Raleigh-Durham, N.C., airport and the crew was forced to use a backup hydraulic 
system to lower the landing gear. The plane had to be towed from the end of the 
runway to the terminal. Flight 154 en route from San Francisco with 284 
passengers and a crew of 13 experienced a failure in the primary hydraulic 
system controlling the landing gear after landing at Dallas-Ft. Worth 
International Airport. The pilot reported trouble steering the craft while 
taxiing and the DC-10 was also towed to the gate.

A Chinese army officer and his wife defected to South Korea across the heavily 
fortified demilitarized zone dividing the two Koreas, the South Korean Defense 
Ministry said. A ministry spokesman identified the defector as Maj. Zuo Xiukai, 
40, the fourth-ranking member of the Chinese delegation to the Korean Military 
Armistice Commission. The Defense Ministry spokesman said the Chinese couple 
remain in protective custody of the American-led U.N. Command after walking 
across the border through Panmunjom truce village. It was the first known 
Chinese defection through Panmunjom, although North Koreans, Soviets and Czechs 
have defected there.

COMMUNITY WORK WILL FREE LOWE OF SEX TAPING TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Times wire services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Rob Lowe will perform community service in Los Angeles to avoid 
prosecution on charges that he videotaped a girl performing a sex act at an 
Atlanta hotel during the 1988 Democratic National Convention, the prosecutor in 
the Georgia city said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe had faced a possible criminal charge of sexual exploitation of a minor, 
with a maximum 20 years in prison and a $100,000 fine, said Dist. Atty. Lewis 
R. Slaton. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe, 25, and his father met with Slaton on Friday, almost a year after he 
allegedly taped the sex scene between Jan Parsons, who was 16 at the time, and 
a female companion. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed to talk to him to size him up to see if he was OK for the program," 
Slaton said. "I felt the young man fit in, but I had to be sure of his 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Lowe will work 20 hours with disadvantaged youths in Los Angeles-area schools 
and "stay out of trouble," for two years, Slaton said, adding that terms of the 
program will be worked out in the next few weeks. The agreement was part of the 
state's pretrial intervention program, "a hybrid alternative" to prosecution 
for young, nonviolent first offenders, Slaton said. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe, who is currently making a film in Los Angeles, remains the subject of a 
civil suit brought by Parsons' mother, who claims the actor seduced her 
daughter.

OFFICERS CALLED TO QUELL FIGHTING AT RAP CONCERT SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several fights between rival gangs broke out during and after a rap concert at 
the Universal Amphitheatre late Friday, but no serious injuries were reported, 
authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and a Los Angeles Police 
Department helicopter team were summoned about 10 p.m. after at least five 
fights erupted in the parking lot, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Cecil 
Rhambo. 
</P>
<P>
No one was seriously injured in the scuffles, and there were no arrests as 
police and deputies ordered the crowd to disperse, Rhambo said. He said one 
20-year-old man suffered facial lacerations in one of the fights. 
</P>
<P>
The gangs also fought inside the amphitheater during the concert, which 
featured LL Cool J, Slick Rick and De La Soul, Rhambo said. The theater's 
security guards rushed in to stop those fights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs have fought at the amphitheater during previous rap concerts, Rhambo 
said. Scuffles broke out during a recent MC Hammer show, but no serious 
injuries were reported, he said.

By Carl A. Hammerschlag, Hammerschlag, former chief of psychiatry, Phoenix Area

<TEXT>
<P>
Having spent most of my professional life in Indian country, I have struggled 
to understand and deal with the overwhelming phenomenon that is alcohol abuse 
among American Indians. I am still filled with shame at my impotence before it 
and with rage at the destruction it wreaks, especially upon unborn children. 
</P>
<P>
It is not enough to say that "The Broken Cord," Michael Dorris' new book about 
Indian alcohol abuse, is good. Written like a prayer from the heart of someone 
strong enough to share his pain, it tells a tale of crimes against Native 
American children that approach the dimensions of genocide. 
</P>
<P>
Dorris -- of Native American (Modoc) descent himself -- is professor of 
anthropology and Native American studies at Dartmouth College and was among the 
first unmarried men in the United States to adopt a very young child. "The 
Broken Cord" is about the first of his three Native American adoptive children. 
</P>
<P>
Adam, born seven weeks prematurely, was severely neglected and abused by his 
biological mother, who died an alcoholic death before she was 35. Gradually, 
Dorris realized that Adam was learning very slowly and that time wasn't 
improving his condition. It was not until the boy was almost 10 years old, 
however, that it became clear to his father that the constellation of his 
physical symptoms -- unusual head shape, altered facial characteristics, 
seizures, skeletal deformities, attention deficit, behavioral problems and 
mental retardation -- meant that he was suffering from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
That the recognition came slowly is no surprise: The first scientific article 
about birth defects in children born to alcoholic parents was not published 
until 1968, the year Adam was born. And not until 1973 were these observations 
at all widespread in the United States. There are now more than 2,000 
contributions to the literature. 
</P>
<P>
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is not unique to Native Americans. It is a serious 
concern in Europe, Asia and Latin America. And yet for scarcely any group is it 
so great a problem as it is for American Indians. Neither smallpox nor 
tuberculosis nor any of the other European infectious diseases (for which 
Indians had no natural immunity), neither military defeat nor the ensuing 
neo-colonialism and racism has accomplished a comparable destruction of the 
native peoples. It is alcohol that may now be sowing the seeds of the "final 
solution" for Native America. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics and history of the problem are not the focus of "The Broken 
Cord." By way of historical overview, though, consider that Adam is a Lakota 
child. The Lakota, whom we call Sioux, are a hunter-warrior group of complex 
religious and healing traditions and exquisite arts and crafts. In the 
beginning, the Lakota were willing to live and let live with the trickle of 
pioneers who first penetrated the Northern Plains. When gold was discovered, 
however, the trickle became a torrent; entrepreneurs, prospectors and hunters 
exploited the sacred Earth. War became inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1880s, the nomadic hunters were restricted by martial law to 
reservations, the buffalo no longer roamed the Plains, and alcohol -- first 
introduced by trappers at the turn of the 19th Century -- had become a growing 
problem. Disconnected from a credible past, from those shared symbols and myths 
that sustain their culture, the Lakota were ripe for the demoralization of 
which alcohol abuse is a manifestation. 
</P>
<P>
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is a completely preventable disease. If mothers abstain 
from alcohol during pregnancy, their children do not become afflicted. But, in 
tragic numbers, the preventable goes unprevented. There are 7,500 reported 
cases of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in the United States each year, and the number 
is probably dramatically under-reported. Those statistics don't include most of 
the cases of Fetal Alcohol Effect, in which the symptomatic manifestations are 
less profound but no less debilitating. 
</P>
<P>
My own experience suggests that Dorris' and others' estimates that up to 
one-third of Indian youngsters are afflicted by Fetal Alcohol Effect may be too 
conservative. There are Indian communities where, if we include the morbidity 
from Fetal Alcohol Effect, the death rate exceeds the live birth rate. 
</P>
<P>
The chilling fact is that alcohol is the most severe and widespread health 
problem among American Indians today. There is scarcely a single living Native 
American who is not directly or indirectly (through the extended family) 
plagued by alcohol. The alcohol-related death rate among Native Americans is 6 
1/2 times the national rate. The suicide rate is 2 1/2 times the national rate 
and even higher among the Native American young. Whatever the theories of 
causation, alcohol is threatening to destroy 1.5 million contemporary Indian 
people. The annihilation is almost unimaginable. 
</P>
<P>
Dorris gives all this a name, a face and a personal history that make it 
impossible for the reader to remain detached. His story is not the musing of a 
well-manicured academic with anthropological objectivity. The book may do 
little in fact to speed Dorris along on the academic fast track. Never 
pedantic, the author is unabashed about his own inflexibility and passionate in 
his exhortations and judgements. 
</P>
<P>
"The Broken Cord" begins as the story of a 26-year-old doctoral student who 
wants a child. Dorris says: "Single parenthood had for generations been the 
practical norm in my family." One would like to know more. Why not get married 
first? Is this some unresolved sexual thing? What are the unconscious dynamics? 
Dorris does tell us of his naivete, even the conceit of his certainty that 
whatever had been the noxious influences in his son's early life, he would by 
dint of his own commitment and love offset them. Adam's life would commence 
from the moment when the two of them came together. 
</P>
<P>
Painfully, Dorris learns that nature is more important than nurture in 
predicting not just physical characteristics but behaviors as well. And he is 
willing to re-examine an idealistic confidence bordering on arrogance and look 
again at everything he once thought he knew. 
</P>
<P>
Dorris is an unusual man. Not only does he adopt Adam knowing that his mental 
development has been quite slow, he also confronts Adam's ever more numerous 
and life-threatening physical maladies. But, despite the fact that these co-opt 
much of his time and energies, Dorris proceeds to adopt two more children while 
still a single parent -- all this while teaching, administering and publishing. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this scene: Adam is napping. Dorris returns from his teaching 
responsibilities to meet the social worker for the first official, 
post-adoption home visit. He proceeds to bake an apple pie from scratch, find 
the ingredients for a tomato-bacon soup lying around, squeeze lemons for 
lemonade and then sift flour for a double-Dutch-chocolate cake. 
</P>
<P>
During the period covered by the book, Dorris publishes a novel ("Yellow Raft 
in Blue Water"), gets promoted to full professor and in between teaches 
high-impact aerobics. (I must be working one-quarter time or have a glandular 
condition.) 
</P>
<P>
Ten years after Adam's adoption, Dorris marries the distinguished, National 
Book Award-winning novelist Louise Erdrich. Erdrich writes an impassioned and 
sensitive foreword to "The Broken Cord." Together they produce three more 
children while pursuing their distinguished careers. 
</P>
<P>
I loved this book, and yet I found myself wanting to know more. What has it 
been like surviving as husband and wife in the face of such daily trauma and 
its explosive potential for divisiveness? Did they ever want to kill each other 
or at least run away? What impact have the afflictions of Adam had on their 
other children? What price the pursuit of their unique vision? I want to know 
more. 
</P>
<P>
This hunger takes nothing away from the power of Dorris' material, however, and 
probably bespeaks mainly my own need to come to peace with my history. You see, 
I also adopted a child, a 3-year-old boy. The experience has been the most 
painful and illuminating of my life, and I have not yet found the courage to 
write about it.

THE MAN WHO DECONSTRUCTED RECONSTRUCTION; 
</P>
<P>
ANDREW JOHNSON: A BIOGRAPHY BY HANS L. TREFOUSSE (W. W. NORTON: $25; 463 PP. 
ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Huston Horn, Horn is at work on a biography of Leonidas Polk, one of the 
Southern planter aristocrats that Andrew Johnson could barely abide. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew Johnson as the pinch-penny senator from Tennessee opposed free stamps 
for Congress but favored free land for homesteaders; Andrew Johnson as the 
visionary President had the gumption -- while the nation's skeptical press 
guffawed -- to pay Russia's must-sell price for Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
To be his own man and to persevere against daunting odds was, indeed, second 
nature for Johnson. Though a states-rights, slave-holding, Tennessee Democrat, 
for example, his common-man passion for his country and the Constitution made 
him such an implacable foe of Civil War secession that in 1864 he became, 
improbably, Abraham Lincoln's vice presidential running mate, and, just a few 
months later, his successor. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, though, that stubborn streak would lead him to dishonor the nation 
that he so loved. 
</P>
<P>
For, as a once-indentured, self-educated tailor from the North Carolina slums 
who scrabbled his way into the White House, he remained all his life an 
unfailing champion of the poor -- but only if they were white. 
</P>
<P>
And rather than assist his own party in building a just, postwar society of 
Southern whites and emancipated blacks, Johnson contrarily dug in against the 
reform-minded Congress and fought its proposals tenaciously. He cast aside a 
matchless creative opportunity, and his impermeable racist legacies, biographer 
Hans Trefousse maintains, poison U.S. culture to this day. 
</P>
<P>
We can admire, perhaps, the remarkable homespun grit Johnson displayed in 
becoming our 17th President; for the shortcomings of his social views, we 
certainly could wish that he had failed. As Trefousse concludes, 
</P>
<P>
notwithstanding the political promise he brought to his critical presidency, 
"his Administration was a disaster. Johnson was a child of his time, but he 
failed to grow with it." 
</P>
<P>
Over other obstacles Johnson, child and man, had achieved surpassing victories 
-- to such an extent that he himself once characterized his life as the 
fulfillment of the American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1808 to a Raleigh janitor and washerwoman of the meanest circumstances, 
he never attended a single day of school. Rather, as a "wild and harum-scarum" 
teen-ager, he ran away to frontier Tennessee to escape the drudgery of 
servitude bound to a tailor -- a kind of early American white slavery. 
</P>
<P>
Safe in Tennessee, he let down roots and began to flower. He married a 
shoemaker's daughter, and 16 years later whom do we find in the Halls of 
Congress but the Honorable Andrew Johnson. The well-read, prosperous 
sometime-tailor and full-time politician is now shrewdly representing the East 
Tennessee Democrats from around Greeneville, his adopted hometown. 
</P>
<P>
Having already served in Tennessee's state legislature, he had honed 
contentious skills, and cultivated a rigid Jacksonian mind-set. These traits he 
displayed in Washington reliably, standing unabashedly against aristocrats, 
public prayer, railroads, banks and $1 bills, excessive public expenditures 
(those free penny-stamps; the acquisition of the manuscript of George 
Washington's Farewell Address; an appropriation to view an eclipse of the sun), 
and protective tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
On the affirmative side, likening American democracy to his view of Christian 
morality, Johnson consistently voted for the poor people, for the taxpayer, for 
freedom of speech and, always, for white supremacy. Disputing one day with a 
historian extolling to Congress the successes of certain black men, Johnson 
sneeringly asked if the speaker would allow his daughter to marry such a man. 
(Ordinarily, his rhetoric ran to more originality; he fancied sprinkling a 
classical quotation or two into his spontaneous remarks.) 
</P>
<P>
When secessionist Tennessee had been largely reconquered by Federal troops 
early in the second year of the Civil War, Lincoln perceived Johnson as almost 
perfect for the job of its military governor. He had already served a term as 
elected governor of the state, and at the war's outbreak was a U.S. senator so 
staunchly pro-Union (the only Southern senator to be that at all) that he had 
declared in a speech he would rather live in Russia under the heel of the czar 
than as a citizen of the Southern Confederacy. 
</P>
<P>
(As a slave owner himself, human bondage did not then seem to distress Johnson; 
his peeve was that the Confederacy was an illegal and unconstitutional cabal of 
Southern planter aristocrats, the gentry he so roundly despised.) 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, swallowing hard, Johnson ingratiated himself completely with 
Lincoln by endorsing the President's Emancipation Proclamation. Slavery is a 
"cancer on our society," he would come to say, and he took to calling slave 
owners "tyrants" (though off stage could still pronounce Abolitionist Frederick 
Douglass a "nigger"). Lincoln's response was to pray God's blessings upon the 
Tennessean and to welcome him onto his 1864, second-term ticket. "Humble and 
unworthy as I am, I will be your Moses," Johnson, catching the fever, told a 
crowd of black Tennessee well-wishers. They gave him a gold watch. 
</P>
<P>
Still, as Trefousse writes, "whatever his motives . . . he had not overcome his 
ingrained prejudices." That would become evident when, with Lincoln's 
assassination in April, 1865, the once penniless runaway was suddenly chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
From the evidence presented, it is hard to say which sentiment President 
Johnson nursed more lovingly: his esteem for the Constitution or his disdain 
for black Americans. Given his Reconstruction policies, the two were at least 
complementary. 
</P>
<P>
Persuaded that the seceded Southern states had never in fact been out of the 
Union (the Constitution forbade it!) Johnson routinely vetoed any congressional 
legislation benefiting the economic welfare or the enfranchisement of the 
South's freed slaves. He argued that since the old Confederate states had as 
yet no U.S. representatives or senators, the federal government could not pass 
laws affecting them. That, Johnson declared, was manifestly unconstitutional, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, said Johnson, the whole thing was Republican bleeding-heart politics: 
His party fellows in Congress, radicals and moderates alike, were merely 
determined to beat down the South's white Democrats, not to lift up its blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Southern lawmakers in their statehouses, conditioned by war's end to accept 
significant social changes, picked up the scent of the Washington winds. In 
short order they had begun to legislate free-rein against the civil rights of 
their black populations. Restrictive black codes, says Trefousse, came "to 
constitute a virtual re-establishment of slavery under a different name." From 
such dregs Americans North and South still drink. 
</P>
<P>
Tearing its hair, Congress at last designed to impeach the President -- itself 
a spurious and cynical strategem -- and Johnson slipped that snare, too, barely 
breaking stride. Like the old knotted and twisted Wembley neckties, he emerged 
from his fractious four years in office a proud, unwrinkled hero to the 
conservative Southerners who in 1860 had called him traitor. Seven years later, 
forgiving Tennesseans even sent its white-race guardian back to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was not a merry man, and Trefousse, if never less than an astute and 
literate historian, is not a merry stylist. "Professorial" comes to mind when 
defining his technique. This biography, then, while scarcely a summery 
entertainment, is, for Americans concerned to know more about how we came to 
our sorry racial pass, bleakly illuminating.

THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK JONATHAN HARRIS, Harris is a frequent contributor to The Times Book 
Review. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children, as harried parents often complain, have an insatiable curiosity about 
the world. They never seem to tire of asking questions and are particularly 
adept at posing ones that adults have trouble answering. Why is the sky blue? 
Why are girls different from boys? 
</P>
<P>
Children, parents also frequently observe, have vivid imaginations. They can 
tell the most astounding lies with the most wide-eyed expressions of innocence. 
Children's love of exaggeration is part of the same process as their quest for 
facts. It is one of the ways they test the limits of their world, explore the 
boundaries of the possible. The separation between fact and fantasy, the real 
and the imaginary, is a common thread in several new children's books. 
</P>
<P>
In There's a Hippo in My Bath! (Doubleday: $12.95; unpaginated) Kyoko Matsuoka 
uses a child's power of imagination to transform a bath into magical adventure. 
Children often have fears about bath time. One of Mister Rogers' more memorable 
songs addresses one of them: "You can never go down, never go down, never go 
down the drain." Matsuoka's delightful picture book speaks to another concern 
of the very young -- what may be lurking in the bathwater. 
</P>
<P>
A mother leaves her son alone to take a bath. The boy climbs into the tub with 
his rubber duckie. The duck dives to the bottom of the bath and surfaces to 
report company. A sea turtle pops his head out of the water. The duck protests 
that the tub isn't an ocean, but that doesn't prevent a pair of penguins from 
bobbing up next. They are followed by a soap-eating seal, a hippopotamus, and 
finally a gigantic whale. They all cavort in the bathtub until the boy's mother 
comes to investigate. The animals immediately vanish. The boy wisely decides to 
keep his bathmates a secret. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuoka uses exaggeration the way children often do -- to show their mastery. 
You can only kid about creatures swimming in your tub if you know the idea is 
impossible. Akiko Hayashi's golden-hued drawings playfully convey the steamy, 
shimmering bathroom and the benevolent animals who emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Marshak's funny poem, The Pup Grew Up!, translated by Richard Pevear and 
illustrated by Vladimir Radunsky (Henry Holt: $13.95; unpaginated), uses 
exaggeration in another way familiar to children. It is the kind of tall tale a 
child might tell when forced to explain an occurrence he can't account for. The 
story concerns a lady who boards a train with a tiny Pekingese and gets off 
with a Great Dane. The book's title is the explanation officials give for the 
discrepancy. Adults will appreciate Marshak's sly dig at bureaucracy, which is 
still as fresh as it was when the book was first published in the Soviet Union 
in 1926. Children will delight in Marshak's sense of absurdity. Vladimir 
Radunsky's illustrations catch Marshak's tone perfectly. Radunsky's exaggerated 
people, bold colors, and graphic use of space reinforce the lunacy of this 
tale, written by Russia's best-known children's author. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Waxman's What Is a Girl? What Is a Boy? (Thomas Y. Crowell: $10.95; 
unpaginated) is a different kind of picture book for 3- to 7-year-olds, a 
volume of straightforward text and photographs that address the basic 
biological differences between the sexes. As Waxman writes in her foreword, 
"Enlightened adults are apt to play down the difference between the sexes and 
encourage the similarities in an effort to foster equality and non-sexist 
attitudes. Yet in doing so, we may be disregarding the child's need for 
elementary information." 
</P>
<P>
Children are naturally curious about sexuality. Since many adults are 
uncomfortable discussing the subject, though, they often don't give children 
the straight facts they want to know. As a result children are left to their 
own imaginations (and society's sexist stereotypes) to explain the differences 
between the sexes: "Boys are ugly!" "Girls are dumb!" "Boys don't cry!" "Girls 
aren't strong!" 
</P>
<P>
Waxman begins by raising and then discarding some of these familiar 
stereotypes: "Some people say a girl is someone who plays with dolls. But Noah 
is taking care of his doll. And he's a boy." She then goes on, in a 
matter-of-fact and non-threatening way, to present the simple biological 
distinction between the sexes. "A boy is someone with a penis and testicles. A 
girl is someone with a vulva and vagina." The photographs show naked children, 
and a naked man and woman, all unself-conscious and comfortable in their 
nudity. The book won't end children's sexual curiosity, but it can help diffuse 
the embarrassment that surrounds the discussions of sexuality. By providing the 
simple facts that children desire, it may even lay the subject to rest for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic School Bus: Inside the Human Body (Scholastic Inc: $13.95; 
unpaginated) is also about biology. Written by Joanna Cole and illustrated by 
Bruce Degen, the book is the third of their very popular Magic School Bus 
science series. Cole and Degen combine fact and fantasy to provide a clever, 
comic-book style approach to science education. Ms. Frizzle and her class go on 
a field trip to the science museum to see an exhibit about the human body. On 
the way (stop me if you've seen this at your local movie theater!), the magic 
school bus is mysteriously shrunk and accidentally swallowed. The field trip 
becomes a wacky voyage inside the human body. 
</P>
<P>
Cole and Degen borrow from comic books, sci-fi movies, and Saturday-morning 
cartoons to create a hip pastiche of information and humor. Like sitcom 
regulars, Ms. Frizzle's class keeps up a steady patter of jokes. "You mean this 
body thinks we're food?" "That's better than being waste." It's humor-coated 
facts for the TV generation who, supposedly, can't concentrate longer than the 
span between commercials and are incapable of digesting their information 
straight. Whether or not that unhappy assumption is true, I found the book long 
on humor and short on science. The comic-book style of joining pictures with 
text in boxes and balloons also makes some of the anatomical drawings, 
especially the workings of the lungs, difficult to read. Despite these 
objections, I'm sure many children will enjoy this. But I think the book is 
more useful at provoking curiosity about the body than explaining how it works. 
Those already curious may find this book as unnourishing as Saturday-morning 
cartoons.

MAKING MOOKIE; 
</P>
<P>
DO THE RIGHT THING BY SPIKE LEE WITH LISA JONES (FIRESIDE/SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: 
$10.95; 297 PP., PAPER) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Chute, Chute is a Los Angeles film critic and screenwriter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his disarmingly candid tie-in with the film of the same name, movie maker 
Spike Lee (writing with Lisa Jones) happily functions as his own strongest 
booster. Journalist Joseph Gelmis, Lee notes, "considers me one of the most 
important film makers in the world today. . . . I've felt this, but hey, now 
somebody else has seen it also." If self-confidence is the key to success (as 
the shrinks tell us), this guy will go far. 
</P>
<P>
He already has, of course, and along the way he's probably needed every ounce 
of that ferocious self-assurance. The sex comedy, "She's Gotta Have It" (1987), 
and the campus musical, "School Daze" (1988), are milestones of black American 
movie making, produced on teensy budgets in the face of daunting obstacles and 
reaching wide mixed audiences. 
</P>
<P>
There has never been anything quite like these films, with their undiluted 
expressions of black culture, outlook, anger. The films are made for a 
sophisticated black art-house audience -- a crowd that the studios didn't 
believe existed until Spike Lee brought it to them on a silver platter. "What 
we're doing is revolutionary and courageous," Lee writes, with some justice. 
"No other black people in the industry are doing what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
The "Right Thing" book contains Lee's screenplay (which diverges from the 
finished product in interesting ways) and the journal he kept as he was writing 
it. The day-to-day record is full of fascinating false starts and variations. 
Lee himself was initially set to play the troublemaker Buggin' Out, for 
example. As casting choices shift almost from page to page, the picture grows 
darker; characters evolve toward something more truthful, if less overtly 
"sympathetic." The ending inexorably darkens. At one point, a character who 
dies and stays dead in the finished version was pegged to reappear -- wearing a 
neck brace -- for an upbeat finale. 
</P>
<P>
Lee is a gifted manipulator of the film medium, and "Do the Right Thing," 
despite some narrative clumsiness, is his most controlled and effective 
picture. His own pivotal performance as Mookie, a pizza delivery man, will 
cement the personal comic celebrity that has helped his career chug forward 
even between pictures. (Directors who are also ingratiating performers, from 
Woody Allen onward, naturally have a leg up.) Set in Brooklyn's 
Bedford-Stuyvesant section on a blisteringly hot day, "Right Thing" builds to a 
climactic race riot. (A few boneheads were even expecting that the movie would 
provoke violence. If anything, it will forestall some incidents, by offering an 
alternative catharsis.) 
</P>
<P>
The book is instructive here: Lee is never seen wondering how race relations 
ought to unfold. He considers news reports about racial incidents in Miami and 
New Jersey, and struggles to honor the facts. His attitudes aren't even 
ambiguous. He complains about blacks who blame all their problems on whites and 
on racism (although he has a knee-jerk tendency toward this sort of thing 
himself) and declares: "There are no winners in this one. Blacks burn down the 
pizzeria, but so what? . . . The conditions that we live under have not gotten 
any better." 
</P>
<P>
Lee knows better than anybody that a lot of youthful black energy is being 
misdirected. The movie is partly about how and why black rage gets sidetracked, 
deflected onto easy targets because the real culprits are too far away or too 
powerful. Only the tag-end quote from Malcolm X, who validates violence as 
self-defense, seems to blur the issue, because the riot in the movie scarcely 
qualifies. 
</P>
<P>
Under the prideful surface of "Do the Right Thing," some observers have 
detected a scathing strain of black self-criticism that goes way beyond the 
controversial depiction of a caste system dividing light-skinned and 
dark-skinned black collegians in "School Daze." The book confirms that Lee was 
thinking hard thoughts even about the character he plays himself. Thus: 
</P>
<P>
"(His sister) is bothered that Mookie -- like many black youths -- has no 
vision. (She) constantly yells at him that he can't see beyond the next day, 
the end of his nose. It's the truth. The future might be too scary for kids 
like Mookie, so they don't think about it. They live for the moment, because 
there is nothing they feel they can do about the future." 
</P>
<P>
Lee's drive to bring full-strength black material to American movie screens 
accounts for a lot of his appeal, and not just to black audiences. His 
"Afrocentricity" is crucial. The absence of crossover dreams gives his films a 
distinctive authenticity. There's been no attempt to translate the story into 
homogenized "universal" terminology. The result of their specificity has been, 
oddly enough, to broaden their appeal: Pictures with a distinctive outlook are 
so rare in today's happy-face Hollywood that we respond eagerly. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's isn't the truth of objectivity and consensus -- a journalist's or 
sociologists truth. It's an artist's truth, roiling with fruitful 
contradictions. A personal frame of reference like this would not seem 
startling in an Italian-American or WASP director, but to the great discredit 
of the American film biz the black version is still a novelty. 
</P>
<P>
Not for long.

IT ALL STARTED WITH VERMEER; 
</P>
<P>
MOVING PICTURES BY ANNE HOLLANDER (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $29.95; 295 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Douglas Messerli, Messerli, a poet and critic, directs Sun &amp; Moon Press.

<TEXT>
<P>
With great erudition and intellectual facility, Anne Hollander argues in 
"Moving Pictures" that motion pictures are rooted in the visual art of the 
Dutch and Flemish genre painters of the 17th Century and their impact, in turn, 
upon artists as diverse as Tiepolo, Piranesi, Canaletto, Hogarth, Goya, Turner, 
Whistler, and others. For Hollander, movies have less to do with the history of 
photography -- with its presentation of reality "congealed in an aspic of 
perfect details" -- than with the properties of light and motion inherent in 
the Dutch paintings. Hollander posits the idea that the images of a Vermeer, a 
Rembrandt, a Van Eyck, in their ambiguous drama of everyday life served 
directly and indirectly (through graphic reproductions of these paintings) as 
sources for 20th-Century film directors and cinematographers. 
</P>
<P>
The important distinction for Hollander is that these painters -- unlike the 
great artists of the Italian Renaissance who created more painterly works of 
art and focused their viewers' attentions upon "the interplay of color, the 
accord of shapes and volumes, the poetry of line, or . . . the dazzling array 
of visible strokes dealt by a masterly wrist" -- created an engulfing art, an 
art that "comes to claim the viewer, acknowledging no barrier between the 
action and his inner life." 
</P>
<P>
The one is theatrical, while the Dutch paintings and their tradition are 
essentially dramatic; and so, too, according to Hollander, are films innately 
dramatic, being works of art based on a sequence of light that ask the viewer 
not to "read" them, but to become immersed in them, sustaining "a drama of 
imminent disclosure and incipient revelation." 
</P>
<P>
Movies, accordingly -- that is, "good" movies, good in the way that the Dutch 
interiors are good -- engage the viewer in a seemingly endless drama of visual 
messages that function just as "real" experience, a series of subjective images 
and actions that weave themselves into the individual consciousness. We cannot 
"read" a film any more than we can "read" the meaning of life. 
</P>
<P>
For anyone who has seen Vermeer's "The Girl With a Red Hat" at the National 
Gallery of Art of Washington, or George de la Tour's "Magdalen With the Smoking 
Flame," at the County Museum of Art, and has observed how like a movie still 
these paintings are, Hollander's argument seems to make sense. And one 
immediately recognizes the relation of such paintings to particular films by 
directors as diverse as Jean Renoir, Ingmar Bergman and David Lean. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, for anyone who has seen more than a dozen movies, the 
comparisons immediately begin to disintegrate. For one quickly recalls that one 
of the central structural elements of cinema -- particularly of American cinema 
-- is the "play within the film." From the Marx Brothers' comedies to "An 
American in Paris," from Melies' early films straight through to the hundreds 
of Hollywood studio musicals and comedies of the 1930s and 1940s, one of the 
major elements of motion pictures has been staged productions, theatrical 
tableaux that break the continuous action of psychological immersion and 
display instead their own formal and narrative meanings. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not such "interruptions" are "inconsistent" with the medium (as 
Siegfried Kracauer argues in "Theory of Film") or not, they are a dominant 
aspect of film making and one of its major structural devices. And no matter 
how one finally judges the "accord of shapes and volumes, the poetry of line," 
and the dazzling formal displays of a Busby Berkeley chorus, one must admit 
that it has helped to define and to shape much of today's cinema. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps these are simply examples of "bad" film making, films that the art 
world cannot take seriously. However, we find similar devices in the films of a 
great director such as Orson Welles. In all of his films, but particularly in 
"The Magnificent Ambersons," Welles stops the dramatic action he so brilliantly 
projects elsewhere with montage and cross-cutting by creating staged tableaux. 
</P>
<P>
Within the many scenes of the Amberson staircase, with the characters listening 
and whispering. Welles purposely distorts the dramatic reality; through strange 
camera angles, theatrical lighting and melodramatic acting techniques. Welles 
calls the viewers' attention to the scene. Suspending the so-called dramatic 
action, Welles reminds his audience that they are, after all, witnessing a 
film, a kind of staged event. 
</P>
<P>
Welles' roots, one recalls, were in theater. And so, too, have been those of 
many other directors, who, when they filmed theatrical plays, brought many of 
the stage's techniques with them. Even Elia Kazan, a realist at heart, whose 
body of work might easily be placed in Hollander's tradition, is overcome by 
the theatrical in a film such as "A Streetcar Named Desire." Despite the 
intense method acting of Marlon Brando, the film turns into an expressionist 
(and mannerist) frieze when Vivien Leigh takes on Tennessee Williams' 
poeticized dialogue: Furniture and set disappear and we are left with a frozen 
image of romanticized madness as powerful and as painterly as Munch's "The 
Scream." 
</P>
<P>
This "theatrical" tradition has been perpetuated by some of today's most 
talented film directors. Francis Ford Coppola's unsung "musical," "One From the 
Heart," Herbert Ross' dubbed musical "Pennies From Heaven," and Alan Rudolph's 
"Choose Me" all present the viewer with a more theatrical cinematic art, an art 
that distances both character and audience from the continuous flow of 
narrative and permits them to "read" or interpret the preceding action. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one might question the whole issue of film being divorced, as it often 
is by theorists, from literary readings. Certainly, there is a danger -- one 
that Hollander recognizes -- when literary types, such as your reviewer, 
attempt to apply the same critical stratagems of fiction and poetry to film. I 
well remember when I taught film as a graduate assistant how we were forbidden 
by the lecturer to discuss the story or dialogue in our sections; everything 
was camera angles and light. Those, of course, are the functional devices of 
film; but cinema has always -- even in its silent days -- been interwoven with 
language, visual and linguistic. Sitting at the dining table across from Melvyn 
Douglas, Garbo may remind us, visually, of Vermeer's red-hatted lady; but for 
Lubistch and his viewer, hers is not just any hat but the hat, a hat of 
particular ideological significance; for this hat represents for the Soviet 
Ninotchka the triviality and corruption of the West. This hat is not simply an 
accouterment of a young, innocent girl, but is an emblem of Ninotchka's 
conversion to capitalist values; the hat atop her head is funny because it 
represents a moment so joyful -- yet so sad. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most exciting aspects of film is its mongrel breeding, encompassing 
as it does visual art (including photography), theater, literature, dance and 
music. Hollander's attempt to place film in the visual art tradition, 
accordingly, is useful if it is seen as part of the larger story. It is one 
thing, in short, to say that some film makers have been influenced -- 
consciously or unconsciously -- by the Dutch tradition of art and have drawn 
images and even methodology from these works of art. 
</P>
<P>
But it is quite another thing to claim, as does Hollander, that such art forms 
both background and foundation for moving pictures. Both visual art (in the 
guise of Clement Greenberg) and fiction (in the critical statements of Robert 
Penn Warren and Cleanth Brooks) have been delimited by notions of their proper 
lineage. Let film -- the young, eccentric genius -- stay clear of such claims 
for its paternity.

DOES HOLLYWOOD HATE GENIUS?; 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT ALTMAN JUMPING OFF THE CLIFF BY PATRICK MCGILLIGAN (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: 
$19.95; 480 PP.); 
</P>
<P>
CITIZEN WELLES BY FRANK BRADY (SCRIBNER'S: $24.95; 655 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There is a vignette in Patrick McGilligan's biography of Robert Altman in which 
Altman, at a low point in his career, is stumbling along a Paris street with a 
pal. Ahead of them they see the massive, caped figure of Orson Welles, on whom 
the young Altman once vowed to model his own film making. Altman starts to 
hurry to catch up with the great man, then thinks better of it. They've got 
nothing to compare notes on except failure and rejection, Altman explains 
bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
It is a historical moment so symbolically perfect as to be apocryphal (although 
it apparently isn't). No film makers of comparable achievement -- not even 
Francis Coppola, who comes close -- have failed quite so noisily to fit into 
the Hollywood system and been condemned, as Welles was in his lifetime and as 
Altman apparently still is, to scrabble in exile for the money to go on making 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, as revealed in two new biographies, are in some ways similar: in 
their charismatic charm, which commanded the fierce loyalty of men and women 
alike, their maverick and often self-destructive resistance to authority, their 
impatient and innovative zest for the making of films, and their protean 
appetites for all experience (also dangerous, again bordering on the 
self-destructive). 
</P>
<P>
But, aside from common geographical origins in the Midwest, Welles and Altman 
are otherwise as unlike, in style and density, as the biographies themselves. 
Welles had great and varied gifts as actor, writer and director for stage, 
screen and radio. Altman is a film maker, neither pure nor simple, with 
excursions to stage and opera. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Brady, the author of "Citizen Welles," is a tenured professor of film and 
writing at St. John's University in Brooklyn. His biography, which can fairly 
be called monumental, authoritative and exhaustive, has been since 1977 in the 
making. If it is not definitive, it is probably because Welles may not 
ultimately be definable. 
</P>
<P>
Brady's detailing of Welles' life is amazingly full, and it was an amazing 
life. Proceeding on a combination of bravado, physical size, a prematurely 
stentorian voice and uncommon intelligence and talent, Welles talked himself 
into a job with Michael MacLiammoir at the Gate Theatre in Dublin when he was 
only 16, occasionally playing old men. 
</P>
<P>
In his researches, Brady found RKO time-sheets that indicated Welles had logged 
111 hours working on the "Kane" script. In the Welles v. Herman Mankiewicz 
dispute, Brady is firmly on Welles' side as the film's principal creator, 
although he also has no doubt that the shared script credit is fair and 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Brady's accounts of the making of the various films are ample and knowing. The 
turmoil surrounding the completion of "The Magnificent Ambersons" is described 
in considerable depth, for example, and so is the furor that greeted "Kane" in 
and out of the Hearst press. 
</P>
<P>
The author reproduces some of Welles' cut-by-cut notes to his various editors. 
From a standing start, when he compared film making to a boy's joy in an 
electric train, Welles had become a meticulous and very well-informed 
craftsman. 
</P>
<P>
The facts of Welles' melancholy last years, when he held court at Ma Maison 
while film projects appeared and vanished like apparitions, are all too 
eloquent. There was talk of a "Lear," which could have been Welles' last, great 
triumph but was never done. Sir John Gielgud located money for Welles to do 
"The Tempest" but Welles knew he was too old to play Caliban and too infirm to 
handle the project. 
</P>
<P>
In a late interview with William Scobie of London's Observer, Welles said, 
"I've always pretended to love Hollywood. Sour grapes are not my dish. But when 
the day of judgment comes and the executives and the moguls are placed in the 
balance against writers and directors, they will be found wanting." 
</P>
<P>
It will do for an epitaph. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick McGilligan, a young film maker and film historian who lives in 
Wisconsin, is an unabashed Robert Altman admirer. You are tempted to say that 
with such an admirer, the subject has no need of detractors. This is to say 
that McGilligan's book gives new dimensions to unsparing candor. 
</P>
<P>
His portrait of the private Altman -- the younger Altman at least -- is grungy, 
bordering on the scabrous: a chronicle of incessant infidelities, chronic abuse 
of alcohol and drugs, the casting aside of loyal friends and co-workers, the 
poisoning of his relationships with most of the major studios in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"The biographer crosses the finish line with a sigh of relief," McGilligan 
writes in a small gem of understatement. "Much has been found out -- but I am 
happy to say that Altman, like any great subject, remains mysterious for me, 
and that his best work remains a joy and a revelation. No matter the ungainly 
strands of his life, his stature has not been diminished for me. Indeed, Woody 
Allen seems to be the only other artist who could give him a run for his money 
as the great American director of our time." 
</P>
<P>
Welles, Francis Coppola, Stanley Kubrick and a few others could be alternate 
nominees for that eminence, but a willful myopia is part of the biographer's 
necessary equipment. 
</P>
<P>
What is true, as McGilligan is saying, is that the work must stand on its own. 
The private life, pristine or prurient, is of interest only as it is reflected 
in the work or as it appears to have got in the way of the work. 
</P>
<P>
It seems fairly clear that Altman's creative frustrations played a role in the 
untidy life style he acquired. "His was a tormented debauchery," McGilligan 
says loyally, "a searching for love and reinforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the frenzied playing, Altman learned his craft well. His films have 
seemed the equivalent of gestural paintings, with a feeling of spontaneity and 
improvisation, of a loose and quite personal immediacy, that is markedly 
different from the ingenious technical invention of the most startling of 
Welles' works. 
</P>
<P>
McGilligan is a sharp and attentive appreciator of Altman's films. In some of 
them the viewer senses that Altman has lost interest somewhat before the last 
reel; the author does not deny that this is so, or that the meaning of some of 
the films is as obscure to Altman as to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Altman's most significant contribution to film making in the '60s and '70s 
has been the kicking aside of the constraints and inhibitions of the so-called 
well-made film, with its technical perfection and its acts all but defined by 
curtains. 
</P>
<P>
Altman's overlapped and sometimes indecipherable sound has infuriated audiences 
accustomed to clarity and coherence, but it has created an emotional force that 
makes the viewer feel the scene even if he or she cannot quite be sure what it 
means. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of movies remain collective and collaborative, seldom bearing, 
like Altman's, a personal signature recognizable in the content as well as the 
form. The occasional state-of-the-private-psyche films that do emerge, like 
David Byrne's "Blue Velvet," owe something to Altman's damn-the-traditions 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
Several of his own films are now solidly in the classic repertory: "Nashville," 
"Brewster McCloud," "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" among them. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, in his own self-determined exile from Hollywood, Altman has been making 
low-budget independent films, always interesting if not always successful. One 
of his proteges, Alan Rudolph, says, "Bob is like a huge furnace that will burn 
forever." McGilligan says, "Robert Altman keeps a-goin'." 
</P>
<P>
McGilligan's own researches, leaning heavily on interviews with Altman's 
present and former friends and relatives, all of whom spoke with few 
reticences, are extensive and central to the portrait. 
</P>
<P>
His writing style is free, to say the least, as when he notes that the early 
Altman had "an office where he was fronting a dog-tattooing business with some 
broad as his supposed secretary." 
</P>
<P>
It is a very far stretch from Brady's circumspect prose, also entertainingly 
readable and congruent with the subject's free-form life style (now, one 
suspects, down-cooled considerably). But so breezy a style has the negative 
effect of undercutting the seriousness and weight of McGilligan's positioning 
of Altman in film history.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: LAST LETTERS PRISONS &amp; PRISONERS OF THE FRENCH

Working from a cache of prisoners' letters that were confiscated by officials, 
Oliver Blanc compares conditions in the Parisian jails and offers brief 
portraits of people who were executed for alleged counterrevolutionary 
activities. His subjects range from Marie Antoinette, the dethroned queen of 
France to middle- and lower-class citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the writers acknowledge their guilt or protest their innocence, the 
recurring theme of the letters is "remember me." It might have comforted these 
unhappy men and women to know that 200 years later, people would read their 
pleas and remember. A welcome antidote to the gaudy celebrations of the 
bicentennial of the French Revolution.

Also from the AIDS file: A full page ad in the trade papers promoting a 
low-budget movie called "The Victims" has roused a response. The ad pictures a 
barechested man positioned sensually between two affectionate women under the 
slogan: If you don't want to catch AIDS go see 'The Victims'! 
</P>
<P>
Charles Cotayo, director of distribution for Florida-based Mochon International 
Film Distribution, said: "We've gotten so many calls from that ad, it's 
ridiculous" -- some from AIDS organizations expressing concern that the film 
might sensationalize its subject. 
</P>
<P>
Cotayo said the film concerns a successful Cuban emigre and family man in Miami 
whose idyllic life is shattered when the threat of AIDS looms after his 
impulsive act of infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
Cotayo called it a cautionary tale of "significant social value" that delivers 
a strong message about unsafe sex. "It's not a sensationalized, exploitative 
movie," he said. "It's reality." 
</P>
<P>
Cast with Florida actors, "The Victims" will get a trial release in south 
Florida on Sept. 15. John M. Wilson

OUTTAKES: BUSY ACTOR, THE OTHER MITCHUM

<P>
For the role of the Chandlereseque title character in the TV movie, "Jake 
Spanner, Private Eye," producer Andrew Fenady thought of Robert Mitchum. 
</P>
<P>
For the role of Jake's brother, Fenady came up with another natural: John 
Mitchum, Bob's real-life brother -- and a veteran character actor who's logged 
more than 70 feature and 400 TV appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Due to air in November on the USA Network, "Jake Spanner" marks a first for the 
Mitchum boys. They've acted together previously in features ("The Way West") 
and TV ("The Family Man") -- but never before played brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from his home in Nevada City, Calif. -- where he and wife Bonnie are 
active in the local Foothill Theater -- John dubbed the assignment "a breeze." 
Even though he takes a bullet during the action. 
</P>
<P>
After all, said John, "Bob's the consummate professional. And I hope I'm 
considered the same." 
</P>
<P>
At 70, John is two years younger than the brother who has long overshadowed 
him. "But there's no jealousy," declared John. "I feel very definitely that my 
forte is as a character actor." 
</P>
<P>
It would be hard, he said, to name a favorite role. "There've been so many -- 
and they've been so varied." But younger audiences may know him best as Clint 
Eastwood's partner, Frank DiGiorgio, in "Dirty Harry," "Magnum Force" and "The 
Enforcer." 
</P>
<P>
Also a singer/songwriter -- he wrote "America, Why I Love Her," the only album 
ever recorded by John Wayne -- John's currently at work on a massive project 
that traces the historic roots of songs, hoping to put it out on audio 
cassette. And he's just authored the anecdotal, "Them Ornery Mitchum Boys" 
(Creatures at Large Press).

OUTTAKES: THE AIDS STORY

<P>
Randy Shilts, author of the best-selling history of AIDS "And the Band Played 
On," is waxing enthusiastic about screenwriter John Gay's four-hour miniseries 
adaptation for NBC, now in final revisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased with it, to be honest. I'm surprised," Shilts told us. "It 
includes the major political themes (from the book) dealing with the negligence 
of the federal government and various institutions" in responding to the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Shilts' greatest fear -- "a major point of negotiations" -- was that exec 
producer Edgar Scherick might sensationalize the saga by focusing on so-called 
Patient Zero, a gay Canadian airline steward who was believed to have spread 
the virus widely, even deliberately. The character is now included "in a very 
marginal way," Shilts said. 
</P>
<P>
As now written, he added, the "human drama" revolves around a heroic researcher 
with the Centers for Disease Control, a gay activist and congressional aide, 
and an infected psychotherapist who was an early AIDS activist/organizer. 
</P>
<P>
Shilts, at his request, will have a cameo as "an obnoxious Washington Post 
reporter who'll reflect the attitude of the media (in the early 1980s) that 
AIDS isn't an important story until heterosexuals are affected or a movie star 
gets it." 
</P>
<P>
A source in Sherick's office said that, contrary to a press report, a director 
has not been signed, and casting is not yet under way. John M. Wilson

POP FACES: WATERFRONT'S DUFFY BREAKS SOUND BARRIER; 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the music business, everybody sounds like everybody else but nobody wants to 
admit it. Singer Chris Duffy, of the Welsh pop duo Waterfront, is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
Vocally, he's a George Michael clone -- and proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to sound even more like him than I do," Duffy admitted. "Why not? 
He's a great singer." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's no fool. He's well aware that the duo's single "Cry" -- from its debut 
album "Waterfront" on PolyGram -- recently cracked the pop Top 10 largely 
because he sounds so much like Michael. Since Michael doesn't have an album out 
now, his fans are hungry for anything resembling his sound. 
</P>
<P>
Like Michael, Duffy, 29, could also pass for a GQ model. So could his 
Waterfront partner, guitarist Phil Cilia, also 29. But being good-looking, 
Duffy insisted, has its drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look like us they want to market you straight to the 15-year-olds," 
he said. "We never felt comfortable with that market. But we were in it for a 
while because we couldn't get any attention in the adult market. If you get too 
entrenched in that market you're sunk. Teen idols have no longevity." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy and Cilia, who are from Cardiff, Wales, have been working together since 
they were 16. "The smartest thing we did was get out of Wales," he said. 
"There's no music scene there. It's just stifling for musicians. When we went 
to London we eventually got a break." 
</P>
<P>
In England, they reached a dead end as a performing unit about four years ago. 
Their solution: take a long break and concentrate on songwriting. That turned 
out to be a smart move. Their material impressed SBK, an American publishing 
company that arranged a record deal with PolyGram. 
</P>
<P>
While basically pleased with the debut album, Duffy knows its limits: "It's 
quite passive as pop albums go. It's not a powerful album. The next one will be 
much punchier -- more up, more dance-oriented." DENNIS HUNT

POP FACES: GRIFFITH MOVES OUT OF THE COUNTRY SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
GRIFFITH'S SWITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nanci Griffith is crossing over from country to pop. 
</P>
<P>
Don't fret -- you won't mistake this for a Dolly Parton "Here You Come Again" 
move any more than you'd mistake the bookish, homespun Texan for the glitzy 
owner of Dollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But the folkish singer-songwriter's upcoming "Storms" album (due in August) 
will be handled by MCA Records' Universal City-based pop department after her 
last three albums were marketed through the company's Nashville-based country 
division. But for the soft-spoken artist, the switch is more one of terminology 
than of style. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what I'm called as long as I'm called," said Griffith, 35, 
looking something like a younger sister of Shelley Duvall as she sat in an MCA 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been marketed as pop in Europe," she continued. "That's my biggest 
market. Plus, country radio and I are allergic to each other, and there was a 
lot of pressure to have hits. 
</P>
<P>
"I sell records, I stay in the black. I was selling more albums than some of 
MCA's artists who had No. 1 hits on country radio. But I got my hands slapped 
for not having hits. If it's not working and it's causing me a headache, then I 
want out, which is what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"To be fair to country radio, I don't listen to it, so why should I have ever 
expected them to listen to me?," said the singer, who moved to Nashville from 
Austin three years ago. "Barbara Mandrell is not my idea of a good time." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, there's not much difference between the new "pop" album and the old 
"country" records. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith still weaves sharp-eyed character studies and short stories in a style 
inspired by such Southern prose writers as Larry McMurtry and Eudora Welty. 
They've caught the attention of Bruce Springsteen, who has recorded a duet with 
Patti Scialfa of Griffith's "Gulf Coast Highway" for possible inclusion on 
Scialfa's upcoming debut album. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "Storms" reflects changes taking place in Griffith's life that go beyond 
a switch in marketing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"1988 was a hard year, personally, for me," Griffith said, noting that the 
grueling tour schedule she has kept up for virtually her whole adult life has 
begun to take its toll. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been saying for five or six years that I want to try some character 
acting and I want to spend more time on my prose," said Griffith, who has 
written two unpublished novels. "And I can't do that on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Character acting? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm open to anything," she said. "I'm at that age where I can do a lot of 
characters. I'm getting little lines in my face." STEVE HOCHMAN

NEWS NOTES: The richest man in America rocks! Sam M. Walton, chairman of the 
board of the Wal-Mart chain of dime stores, jammed with Wayne Toups &amp; 
Zydecajun on a hot Cajun version of Hank Williams' "Jambalaya" at a recent 
Wal-Mart stockholders weekend. In a letter thanking the band for its 
appearance, Walton exclaimed: "I don't know when any group of associates and 
financial analysts enjoyed anything more." . . . Actress/New-Age spiritualist 
Shirley MacLaine was instrumental in the creation of the cover art on Jamie 
Michaels' New-Age/folk album, "Bouquet." The art was "channeled" by Brazilian 
medium Luis Gasparetto during a private session with MacLaine, which she 
recounts in her current best seller, "Going Within." 
</P>
<P>
Aerosmith is in town to shoot a new video for an upcoming single, "Love in an 
Elevator." The song will appear on the group's next album, "Pump," due Sept. 
12. . . . The Beach Boys' "Still Cruising" album, due in late August, features 
such film-score hits and misses as "Kokomo," their No. 1 smash from "Cocktail," 
and "Let's Go to Heaven in My Car," a lesser-known Brian Wilson gem that was on 
the "Police Academy IV" sound-track album. . . . The first album from Bonham, a 
new group fronted by Jason Bonham, the 24-year-old son of the late Led Zeppelin 
drummer John Bonham, is due in September. Title: "A Disregard for Timekeeping." 
. . . Crowded House's new four-song maxi-single, "I Feel Possessed," features 
new versions of three Byrds oldies that were recorded -- with the Byrds' Roger 
McGuinn in the lead at the group's April concerts at the Pantages Theatre. . . 
. Having already given the pop world the Carpenters and the Blasters, Downey 
might appear depleted as a musical resource. But the city is also home to 
Mellow Man Ace, a black Cuban rapper whose bilingual debut album, "Escape From 
Havana," is due next month from Capitol Records.

FINALLY: The centerpiece of Weird Al Yankovic's new movie "UHF" is a spot-on 
parody of Dire Straits' 1985 hit "Money for Nothing." The sequence is an 
uncanny re-creation of the computer-animated look of the prize-winning video, 
but the really amazing thing is how the guitarist nailed Mark Knopfler's guitar 
part so perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was pretty easy, since Knopfler played the part himself. It's the 
first time that one of Yankovic's parody subjects has participated in the 
spoof. 
</P>
<P>
The song and five others from the movie are featured on Yankovic's new album, 
"Original Motion Picture Soundtrack &amp; Other Stuff." Our favorite: "Spam," 
an ode to the canned meat set to the tune of R.E.M.'s "Stand."

OPPOSITION BLOC FORMS IN SOVIET; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS RADICALS IGNORE LENIN EDICT, ASK BOLDER REFORMS

<P>
Radical members of the Soviet Union's new national assembly, organizing the 
first formal opposition group within the country's political system in nearly 
70 years, Saturday called on President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to undertake even 
bolder reforms and lead the nation out of what they called a deepening crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The radicals, all members of the Congress of People's Deputies, argued that the 
reforms undertaken up to now have been largely half-measures and consequently 
have not solved the country's structural political, economic and social 
problems -- and in some cases have made them worse. 
</P>
<P>
If perestroika, as Gorbachev's reforms are known, is to succeed, much more 
sweeping changes will be needed, the deputies said, starting with the 
replacement of unelected Communist Party and government officials who continue 
to wield great power but without direct responsibility to the people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loyal Opposition 
</P>
<P>
The radicals, moreover, are offering, in a move that would substantially alter 
the top-down command structure of Soviet socialism, to serve as a critical but 
loyal opposition to the government in order to ensure the progress of 
perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri N. Afanasyev, director of the Moscow Historical Archive Institute, 
appealed to Gorbachev to move away from his centrist position, where he has 
balanced the demands of the radicals and conservatives, and to forge ahead with 
more fundamental changes in the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev is regarded, quite justifiably, as the man who launched our 
reforms," Afanasyev declared. "But the time has passed when he can successfully 
remain the leader of perestroika and the leader of the nomenklatura. He has to 
make a choice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A New Class' 
</P>
<P>
The nomenklatura -- those party and government officials appointed by the 
party's powerful Central Committee -- now constitute "a new class" in the 
Soviet Union, the radical populist leader Boris N. Yeltsin told the meeting, 
implying the need in terms of Marxist-Leninist politics for a "class struggle" 
to remove them from power. 
</P>
<P>
The widespread strikes by Soviet coal miners this month "showed the growing 
social tension in the country and the fact that the working class has lost all 
faith in those who are supposed to be its leaders," Yeltsin said, praising the 
strike committees as "embryos of real people's power." 
</P>
<P>
"The party aristocracy has become a class in itself," he added. "The workers' 
movement is directed against that class, even if it does not yet recognize this 
fact." 
</P>
<P>
And Gavriil Popov, a prominent economist who proposed creation of an 
independent group of deputies two months ago, said that the miners' strikes had 
demonstrated the need for an alternative political voice. The strikes were not 
only justified, he said, but stemmed directly from the failure of Gorbachev's 
reforms to change the harsh day-to-day life of Soviet workers. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies plan to create a formal structure today for what they call an 
Inter-Regional Group, which the official Tass news agency characterized as 
"left radical" in its orientation, as a way to put pressure on the Soviet 
leadership and to push their ideas throughout the legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
Although the radicals deny that they will constitute a rival to the ruling 
Communist Party, of which most are members, or an opposition in the Western 
sense, the new group intends to criticize the government publicly and to work 
in the Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet, the standing 
legislature, for policy changes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are avoiding the words 'opposition' and 'faction' because they are 
perceived here so negatively," Yuri Andreyev, a Moscow deputy, told 
journalists. "In reality, this is a group of opposition deputies who want to 
work in an organized way at the Congress and at the Supreme Soviet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Profound Changes Reflected 
</P>
<P>
The apparent willingness of the Communist Party leadership to tolerate the new 
group is another reflection of the profound changes under way within the Soviet 
political system, and the group's creation against the background of widespread 
dissatisfaction with the party's performance appears likely to have a 
far-reaching impact. 
</P>
<P>
Political "factionalism," as virtually any group criticism of official policy 
or advocacy of any alternatives is termed, has not been tolerated within the 
Soviet Communist Party since its 10th Congress in March, 1921. The last rival 
party, the Socialist Revolutionaries, was suppressed in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
Although V. I. Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, had said that it was 
"permissible . . . for different groups to organize in blocs" and seek support 
for their positions, particularly before party conferences, he grew so 
impatient with the radical Workers Opposition in 1920 and 1921 that in a 
pamphlet on "The Party Crisis" he declared, "The time has come to put an end to 
the opposition, to put a lid on it -- we have had enough of opposition now!" 
</P>
<P>
In a move that then became a central feature of the Soviet system, the party 
then adopted its "anti-factionalism" rule, firmly establishing the top-down 
character of Soviet socialism and effectively outlawing dissent. 
</P>
<P>
"All class-conscious workers must clearly realize the perniciousness and 
impermissibility of factionalism of any kind," the party declared. "No matter 
how the representatives of individual groups may desire to safeguard party 
unity, in practice, factionalism leads inevitably to the weakening of teamwork 
and to intensified and repeated attempts by the enemies of the party, who have 
fastened themselves onto it because it is the governing party, to widen the 
cleavage and to use it for counterrevolutionary purposes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liberals Remain Skeptical 
</P>
<P>
So instilled has this thinking become that even many liberals remain skeptical 
-- even frightened -- by suggestions of any political opposition here. 
</P>
<P>
Tass reported, for instance, that some people "have expressed the fear that in 
this complex time for the country, when unity of action is required, this 'left 
radical group' might turn into some kind of opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Sergei Stankevich, a political scientist who represents a Moscow constituency, 
anticipated this reaction in explaining the goals of the new group, which now 
has its own newspaper, has formed a small research staff and is seeking 
operating funds. Writing last week in the first edition of the People's Deputy, 
the group's paper, he said: "No sooner does someone pronounce the words faction 
and opposition from the rostrum than some people feel their hearts drop to 
their feet and their backs break out in sweat, while others get a hunter's 
spark in their eyes and a militant shout rises in their throats." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, 240 deputies participated in the meeting at the headquarters of 
the Cinematographers' Union, one of the country's most avant-garde groups. With 
more deputies reported en route to take part in the group's establishment 
today, organizers hope for an initial membership of 400. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress of People's Deputies has 2,250 members, nearly a third of whom 
generally voted as an informal liberal bloc on politically sensitive issues, 
with a slightly larger number on the conservative side and a swing group of 
moderates in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nationwide Following 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who won 89% of the vote in his Moscow-wide constituency and has 
developed a nationwide following, is likely to be elected as the group's 
leader. He was ousted from the party's ruling Politburo nearly two years ago 
after complaining about the slow pace of perestroika. 
</P>

of the legislature's two chambers, urged the deputies to work within the 
Supreme Soviet's commissions to push their ideas, promising to cooperate with 
them to make the new legislature an effective body. 
</P>
<P>
"You seem to want an (opposition) organization for the sake of having one," 
Primakov said to shouts of angry disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who later told reporters he was present as a guest of the group and 
would not join it himself, noted that the Supreme Soviet closely scrutinized 
all members of the new government, rejecting a number and raising crucial 
problems throughout its lengthy debate. The legislature had also released all 
students from the army, meeting a popular demand, and prepared a law raising 
old-age pensions and welfare payments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Longer Only Leader 
</P>
<P>
Afanasyev said that the radicals believe Gorbachev is now trailing the popular 
demand for deeper, more thorough political and economic changes. "I think 
Gorbachev finds it difficult to understand that he is no longer the only leader 
of perestroika, that whole sections of our society are producing new leaders of 
reform," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Politburo, the government and Gorbachev himself have to listen to the 
voices coming from the people and recognize our present realities. The 
Gorbachev status quo of perestroika, this deformed hybrid we have, is 
preventing us from moving ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Outlining the theoretical basis for the new group, Afanasyev said that the 
radicals believe that, without renouncing the ideals of socialism, they should 
take a broader view of it than before and proceed "from Jesus Christ through 
Lenin's death agony to contemporary social democracy" in redefining it as a 
political ideology and working out national policies.

<P>
They come to Los Angeles by the hundreds every day, not all of them legally. 
Lured from impoverished, often war-ravaged homelands by images of a bountiful 
America, most want for little more than a better place to live. 
</P>
<P>
Most do not find it. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants with minimum-wage skills arriving from Asia or Latin America 
typically end up settling in Los Angeles' cheapest and oldest housing -- one of 
43,406 apartments found among the more than 1,500 aging brick buildings that 
dot the city core. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State of Disrepair 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of these buildings, in neighborhoods such as Westlake, Highland Park 
and Koreatown, have slid into filthy disrepair over the years, leaving untold 
numbers of cramped, decaying hovels, many of them little larger than jail 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for such residences, even those with crumbling walls and dripping ceilings 
-- places where rats scuttle across the floors and drug dealers prowl the 
hallways -- there is a surplus of tenants who will pay more than half their 
monthly salaries in rent. 
</P>
<P>
"People come to Los Angeles to work," observed Gary Squier, the city's housing 
coordinator, "and they'll live anywhere they can to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why slums have become a growth industry in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
An insatiable demand for low-income housing combined with skyrocketing property 
values have given rise to a shadowy corner of the real estate market in which 
Los Angeles' most decrepit apartments have become among the most sought after, 
The Times found in studying some of Los Angeles' most notorious slums. 
</P>
<P>
So limited is the supply of low-income housing and so strong the demand for it, 
according to officials and tenants alike, that owners often need not worry 
about keeping up their brick buildings -- which are simply called "bricks" in 
the trade -- to keep them fully occupied. 
</P>
<P>
In the vernacular of slums, the process is called "milking the cow" -- 
squeezing the rent out of apartment buildings without regard to their condition 
or that of the people living in them. 
</P>
<P>
For the less-than-scrupulous investor, slums offer a plethora of financial and 
legal loopholes, weak or non-existent state regulations and ample opportunity 
for rent skimming, pyramiding scams, insider loan deals and bankruptcy fraud, 
The Times found. 
</P>
<P>
For the people who inhabit the slums, the options are considerably narrower. 
Around the corner and down the street from some of the city's more opulent 
neighborhoods, thousands have no choice but to live under Third World 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers tell part of the story. Rents have gone up an average 110% citywide 
since 1980, leaving better, once-affordable units out of reach of the very 
poor. Moreover, most new apartments in Los Angeles are built for the middle and 
upper classes. 
</P>
<P>
So, as vacancy rates for all rentals in Los Angeles have increased over the 
last several years -- from 2.8% in 1977 to 4.3% in 1987, according to one city 
report -- vacancies among the lowest-priced inner-city apartments have, by all 
estimates, dropped to near zero as the poor compete for a dwindling supply of 
bottom-line housing. 
</P>
<P>
And with fewer affordable apartments available, more of them have become 
overcrowded. Units designed 50 years ago to house one or two people now 
frequently accommodate extended families, whose members must sleep and eat in 
shifts for lack of space. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council passed a law in December, 1986, making it a 
misdemeanor for a landlord to overcrowd an apartment. But according to 
officials, tenants and slumlords, the law is rarely enforced. That, they say, 
makes for a mixed blessing: fewer tenants are kicked out on the street, but the 
buildings continue their downward slide from overuse and lack of maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the percentage of "substandard" rental units in Los Angeles -- those 
with gaping holes, non-working plumbing, inadequate heating and the like -- 
jumped from 14.5% of the available rental stock in 1977 to 23% last year, 
according to a report prepared for the Community Development Department. There 
were 166,512 substandard rental units of all kinds in Los Angeles as of last 
year, two-thirds of which needed "massive" rehabilitation, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Are Well Kept 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, many old apartment buildings have been kept up by their owners and 
continue to offer decent housing to those who can least afford it. And, at the 
same time, a multi-agency Slum Housing Task Force formed by the city in 1980 
has aggressively targeted the worst buildings and prosecuted their owners. 
</P>
<P>
But officials point out that hundreds of other aging apartment houses not bad 
enough to concern the task force have fallen even further into disrepair amid a 
flood of immigrants and city inspections that generally are conducted only when 
tenants complain. 
</P>
<P>
Most tenants, fresh from the Third World and fearful of attracting attention to 
themselves, do not complain. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is far worse today than ever before," said Barbara Zeidman, the 
city's rent stabilization director. "For every terrible slum building the task 
force deals with, there are 10 others that a year from now will look just like 
it. They're hard to catch." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is so amorphous that officials do not even know how many true slum 
buildings there are in Los Angeles. Zeidman placed the number at between 750 
and 800, while Milford Bliss, chief of the city's Bureau of Community Safety, 
put it at 200. 
</P>
<P>
What is known is that few banks or savings and loans will finance the purchase 
of older, inner-city apartment buildings. This informal but widely held policy 
has spawned an environment in which nearly seven of 10 slum buildings are 
traded without the involvement of financial institutions, a recent 
city-sponsored study found. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wary of the Risks 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that there has been a history of many institutions 
ignoring these (buildings)," said Barry Rubens, who has been a savings and loan 
consultant for 31 years. "I just don't think they want to risk the adverse 
publicity." 
</P>
<P>
For those needing outside financing to purchase slum buildings, there exists a 
handful of opportunistic lenders who issue high-interest loans -- and sometimes 
defraud those who get them, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations governing these lenders, administered by a maze of bureaucratic 
state agencies, are weak in certain key areas. In some cases, there simply are 
no regulations. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Congress and the California Legislature have passed various laws 
in recent years requiring that lenders disclose sometimes-hidden details about 
loans to the buyers of single homes and small rental properties. Sellers, by 
law, must alert buyers to defects in the properties they are buying. The same 
laws, however, do not apply to transactions involving apartment houses. That 
gap in regulation, critics contend, has created a market rife with deceit. 
</P>
<P>
Exasperated by the system, City Atty. James K. Hahn and his staff in late March 
took action. The city, teamed with the Legal Aid Foundation and a private law 
firm, filed a massive lawsuit alleging that 142 defendants, including a 
respected savings and loan in Highland Park and A &amp; B Loan Co., a 
little-known Inglewood-based private lender, have secretly conspired to control 
11 slum buildings through questionable lending practices, front men, 
unsuspecting dupes and dozens of shell companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Agreement 
</P>
<P>
On July 12, A &amp; B, its president and nine related defendants signed an 
unprecedented agreement in which they promised to change their lending policies 
and force borrowers to repair slum buildings -- or face losing them. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which represented a partial settlement of the landmark lawsuit 
filed in March, was hailed by prosecutors as the first step in breaking what 
one attorney termed "the cycle of slum transfers." 
</P>
<P>
Whether A &amp; B and others named in the city attorney's lawsuit represent an 
anomaly, the tip of the iceberg or a group of passing acquaintances falsely 
accused depends on who is doing the talking. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the true picture, The Times in a two-month investigation found 
evidence showing that as far back as the mid-1970s, many of those named in the 
suit have repeatedly transferred between themselves some of Los Angeles' most 
miserable apartment houses in a process that those in the trade call 
"churning." 
</P>
<P>
It is a convoluted and often lucrative process in which investors sometimes are 
as well-hidden as the profits they make, The Times found. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use of 'Straw Men' 
</P>
<P>
Investors who hold mortgages on slum apartment buildings frequently arrange it 
so that they do not appear as the owners of record. In their place are "straw 
men" paid or duped into taking title. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, to further insulate themselves from scrutiny and prosecution, 
investors create "shell" companies, listing as mortgage holders acquaintances 
or employees. The names of maids and pet dogs have even been used as property 
owners on mortgage papers. 
</P>
<P>
As rent money is funneled to the investors, the presumed owners are socked with 
health and safety code violations, delinquent utility bills and back property 
taxes. Eventually, the buildings wind up in foreclosure, where the debts are 
erased and new "owners" take over. 
</P>
<P>
The rents, meanwhile, continue to flow into the pockets of the investors who 
hold the mortgages and evade responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
These buildings are sold frequently, sometimes several times a month, with a 
higher selling price each time. By boosting a building's value, at least on 
paper, an investor can claim a larger deduction for property depreciation on 
his income tax. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear is that in the process, thousands of impoverished tenants have 
come to be treated as an afterthought. Basic human needs -- working plumbing, 
adequate lighting, sufficient ventilation -- have been all but ignored. 
</P>
<P>
And the slums have slid ever more deeply into decay. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the apartment buildings in Los Angeles that have come to be regarded as 
today's slums went up in the first 30 years of this century, during an economic 
boom of incomparable proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture was flourishing. There were jobs on the railroads and in the oil 
fields. The tuna canning industry was burgeoning, as was the movie industry. To 
find workers, local civic leaders campaigned in the Midwest and New England, 
trumpeting Los Angeles as a nirvana of fragrant orange groves and endless 
summers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1890, 50,393 people lived in Los Angeles. By 1910, the city's population had 
leaped to 319,198. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building With Bricks 
</P>
<P>
To house the trainloads of newcomers, investors erected dozens of apartment 
buildings in and around downtown. Because clay was more plentiful and cheaper 
than timber, the buildings were made of brick. In 1912, local kiln operators 
were turning out more than a million of them a day to meet the demand. 
</P>
<P>
Held together with soft mortar and without steel reinforcement, the bricks 
formed the walls of three- and four-story apartment houses that were more 
functional than luxurious. Fashioned on a smaller scale after Eastern 
tenements, the buildings typically featured central courtyards and shared 
hallways, steam heat, high ceilings and fold-down Murphy beds. 
</P>
<P>
Brick construction continued unabated until March, 1933, when the Long Beach 
earthquake struck, killing 120 people. Many of the victims were crushed by 
brick walls that shook apart in the temblors. 
</P>
<P>
Within six months, state officials had passed laws that effectively did away 
with the construction of unreinforced masonry buildings. But it was not until 
1981 that Los Angeles passed laws requiring the strengthening of the city's 
8,000 brick and cinder-block buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Although owners generally have had to be prodded into taking corrective action, 
Carl Deppe, Earthquake Division chief for the city's Department of Building and 
Safety, said few have grumbled about shelling out the $3.50 to $6.50 per square 
foot it costs to make a residential brick structure earthquake safe. 
</P>
<P>
"They know there's a good return on these buildings," Deppe said. "They'd 
rather improve than demolish." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asking Prices Rise 
</P>
<P>
As rents have risen in Los Angeles, so too have the asking prices of slum 
buildings, despite the deteriorating condition of many. Three or four years 
ago, slum buildings were selling for about four times their gross rents, 
according to those in the business. That means that if an apartment house 
generated $100,000 annually, a buyer could expect to pay about $400,000 for it. 
Today, that same building would sell for $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even at such prices, slums remain a bargain for real estate speculators priced 
out of the Valley and the Westside, where apartments can sell for as much as 12 
times annual gross. 
</P>
<P>
There are also tax incentives for those who buy or invest in slums. While the 
1986 federal Tax Reform Act did away with depreciation provisions that made 
investments attractive in other residential properties, it retained substantial 
tax credits for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are pitfalls for those who get into the low-rent apartment 
business with legitimate intentions. 
</P>
<P>
Several owners interviewed for this series of stories complained that 
overzealousness on the part of city officials makes the job of maintaining or 
rehabilitating an aging apartment building all but impossible. Almost 
universally, they say that the task force, made up of representatives from the 
city attorney's office, Fire, county Health Services and Building and Safety 
departments, unfairly holds new owners liable for code violations that 
developed under previous owners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims of Success 
</P>
<P>
The task force, which has grown to include five full-time assistant city 
attorneys, has sent landlords to jail on 57 occasions since 1981 and claims 
credit for having brought to code 4,000 substandard rental units. 
</P>
<P>
"If they like you, they'll give you all the slack in the world," said one 
embittered owner, "and if they don't, they'll send you to jail for a burned-out 
light bulb over an emergency exit." Task force officials say they do their best 
to apply the laws evenly. 
</P>
<P>
One owner who is not resentful of the city's efforts but who has had troubles 
of a different sort is Bill Carson, a former aerospace worker who saw 
low-income apartment buildings as a way of paying his children's college 
tuition. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, 58, whom city officials hold up as a shining example of a 
conscientious, low-income landlord, bought his first building around 1974. 
Today, he owns 15 of them, and controls 500 apartments. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Carson acquired a 27-unit building on Rampart Boulevard near 
MacArthur Park. It was erected in 1928 and falling apart. Carson budgeted about 
$25,000 to bring it up to code, he said. It took him four times that amount to 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to pour money into these things," Carson said. "A lot of people who 
get into them just don't realize that. Nobody tells you those sorts of things 
going in." 
</P>
<P>
No one is required to. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sophisticated' Buyers 
</P>
<P>
As the laws were written over the last decade, according to state and federal 
officials, it was felt that buyers of income-producing properties invariably 
were "sophisticated" and did not need the kinds of disclosure protections 
afforded buyers of private homes and smaller rental properties. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude in the Legislature is that business is the big guy and big guys 
can take care of themselves," said Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), a former 
president of the California Board of Realtors. "The reality is that if you're a 
neophyte getting into these kinds of transactions, you might find yourself 
getting undressed rather quickly." 
</P>
<P>
There are other laxities in the law that leave open opportunities for fraud 
involving apartment house transactions. California's limited partnership laws, 
for example, make it impossible for an honest investor to check who may be 
behind the partnership. General partners must be listed with the secretary of 
state's office, but limited partners do not have to, allowing unscrupulous 
businesses to hide their true owners. 
</P>
<P>
Or consider appraisers. When someone enters into a contract to buy a home, the 
lender invariably requires an appraisal to ensure that the amount being loaned 
on the property is in line with its actual value. 
</P>
<P>
At least 18 states certify appraisers and periodically review their work to 
make sure that appraisals are not falsely inflated or otherwise fraudulent. In 
California, appraisers are not regulated by the state, although there is 
legislation pending. 
</P>
<P>
Title insurance companies, which ensure that consumers hold clear title to the 
properties they buy, are in a similar boat. There are no laws in California 
requiring that property buyers have title insurance. And even when they do, 
there is nothing in the books that says a title insurance company must conduct 
a thorough examination of a property's title history before issuing that 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hidden Loans 
</P>
<P>
The result has been financially disastrous for some apartment house buyers who 
have ended up assuming loans that were not disclosed to them when they took 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Often as not, records suggest, those buyers are immigrants who many be 
particularly ignorant of the financial complexities of buying an apartment 
house. As Zeidman of the city's Community Development Department puts it, there 
is often a "cultural differentiation" when it comes to immigrant landlords and 
city regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"Frequently," Zeidman said, "non-native owners do have a great deal of 
difficulty understanding the scope of the housing laws in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
That differentiation has generated more than a little animosity among 
established owners of brick apartment buildings, some of whom blame newly 
arrived foreigners -- both tenants and landlords -- for slum conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The attitude of Steve Melnyk, who owns five low-income buildings and who, like 
Carson, is regarded by officials as a model low-income landlord, is typical. As 
he puts it: 
</P>
<P>
"You rent to a nice couple and four or five days later, you get a call that the 
toilet's stopped up; they're using it as a garbage disposal. So you send the 
maintenance man over and he comes back and tells you, 'Holy hell, the place is 
wall-to-wall mattresses.' There are six or eight people living in a combination 
living room-bedroom. They don't know how to use shower curtains and the water 
goes down and caves in the ceiling in the apartment below. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'To Hell With It' 
</P>
<P>
"After the fifth time, the landlord says to hell with it. I can't afford to 
keep fixing this. I spent all my capital buying the place." 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that the slums are becoming more crowded and, at the same 
time, more expensive to live in. Even at $275 to $350 per month, the going rate 
these days for a 425-square-foot, one-room apartment, many newcomers making the 
minimum wage or on welfare cannot afford to pay the rent by themselves or even 
with a spouse's second income. 
</P>
<P>
A rent stabilization review released by the city last year found that in 1977, 
poor families in Los Angeles -- those with annual earnings of less than $10,000 
-- paid out 37% of their income in rent. By 1987, 60% of the average poor 
family's income was going to rent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the demand, few banks have been willing to issue loans on slum 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Melnyk said he noticed a change after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, when the 
issue of unreinforced brick buildings was raised anew. 
</P>
<P>
"After the quake, all these lenders started backing off because they were all 
afraid of financing potential piles of rubble . . . and because they didn't 
know what kind of seismic ordinances the city was going to pass and how much it 
was going to cost them," Melnyk said. 
</P>
<P>
With the creation of the slum task force in 1980, even fewer banks and savings 
and loans would make loans on unreinforced brick buildings, according to 
several long-time banking observers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Running Out of Capital 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these buildings are bad risks; the foreclosure rates are very high 
because a lot of the people who get into them don't have the capital to fix 
them," said the chief officer of one locally based savings and loan. "And with 
the city coming in, demanding compliance with (the building and safety) code, a 
lot of these guys will simply walk away from the property, leaving you holding 
the bag if they don't have the money to make the fixes." 
</P>
<P>
In this financial void, however, at least one savings and loan, Highland 
Federal, and several private mortgage bankers and brokers have found a 
lucrative niche. These lenders operate in what amounts to a financial frontier 
of fast deals and high leverage. 
</P>
<P>
Highland Federal became one of the most profitable savings and loan 
associations in the county by issuing mortgage loans on old apartment 
buildings, precisely because so few other lenders would. Legally charging 
higher loan fees and higher interest rates than other lenders, Highland Federal 
has repeatedly issued large loans -- some of them relatively risky third, 
fourth and fifth trust deeds -- to several of the city's most infamous 
slumlords. 
</P>
<P>
Less-regulated "hard money lenders," particularly A &amp; B Loan Co. in 
Inglewood, have taken up where federal regulations have forced savings and 
loans to leave off. 
</P>
<P>
A &amp; B holds a California personal property broker's license, a consumer 
finance lender's license and a commercial finance lender's license, all issued 
by the state's Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
A personal property broker can make consumer loans but must take back as 
collateral an item of personal property -- shirts and stoves are allowed -- 
from the borrower. A consumer finance lender can make loans so long as the 
loans are secured by real estate or personal property. A commercial finance 
lender makes commercial loans greater than $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incorrect Assumption 
</P>
<P>
A loan applicant might assume that with so many licenses, A &amp; B would be 
closely regulated by the state. The assumption would be incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, California law stipulates that commercial loans of less than $5,000 
and consumer loans of less than $10,000 are subject to extensive regulation. 
But there is literally no regulation when the loans are larger than those 
amounts. 
</P>
<P>
"It is assumed that (these types of lenders) are lending their own monies so 
that is why they are not regulated like a savings and loan or whatever," said 
Richard Murakami, the Department of Corporations assistant commissioner for 
financial services. "The thinking is that those who get large loans are 
sophisticated enough to know what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, not all of them are. 
</P>
<P>
All too frequently, one high-interest loan after another is heaped on a slum 
building as the owner struggles to stay afloat financially. In the end, with no 
reserves left, the owner defaults. The building is handed off to yet another 
buyer with little more than the required low-down or no down payment. The new 
buyer lacks the money for major improvements, let alone maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
And the slum slides ever more deeply into decay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SLUMS -- THE TERMS OF THE TRADE 
</P>
<P>
BRICKS -- Used synonymously to describe shabby, brick apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
CASH COW -- A building that produces much rent, which invariably is paid in 
cash to hide owner income. 
</P>
<P>
CHILLING THE BID -- Rigging a foreclosure sale by falsely inflating the amount 
of outstanding loans or in other ways making the property so financially 
unattractive that a prearranged buyer is certain to win the bid. 
</P>
<P>
CHURNING -- Repeatedly transferring title on a building among a few buyers in a 
brief period. 
</P>
<P>
HARD MONEY LENDER -- Small, private loan companies that typically charge higher 
interest rates and fees and are often the last resort for borrowers who cannot 
get loans anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
LOAN-TO-VALUE (LTV) -- Sliding ratio used by lenders to determine how much 
money they will lend on a building. For example, if an apartment building is

PLAYING FAVORITES AT HUD: LATEST TWIST ON OLD GAME

<P>
When Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980, developer John L. Allen told 
a city official in Durham, N.C., that his firm would have to "switch aisles" to 
win federal funds for a housing project for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing a Democratic Administration with a Republican one meant wrenching 
changes in the nation's housing policy, a new cast at the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development and profitable new opportunities for developers with the 
right connections. 
</P>
<P>
But not everything changed. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, evidence suggests that the Reagan crew simply added a new twist to the 
old game of using influence and favoritism in awarding HUD grants and subsidies 
-- though even conservative analysts agree that the Reagan Administration 
system led to abuses of unprecedented magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
As the current congressional hearings on HUD agency practices have amply 
demonstrated, winning housing grants in the Reagan years depended heavily on 
hiring the right Republican consultant, such as former Secretary of the 
Interior James G. Watt or former Florida Republican Party Chairman William L. 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
But the congressional investigators have heard little testimony about the fact 
that from 1976 to 1980, while Democrat Jimmy Carter was President, developers 
with Democratic ties grew rich building and rehabilitating housing for the poor 
and elderly with millions of dollars in HUD funds. Instead of hiring 
politically connected consultants, these developers contributed to the right 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly in the last 18 months of his presidency, according to one former 
senior Carter strategist, Carter "littered the country" with HUD grants in an 
attempt to rescue his failing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate and housing developers are traditional bankrollers for politicians 
because they depend on favorable government decisions at almost every stage of 
a project and the stakes can be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
HUD was thrust into the relationship because it could loan developers money at 
low rates and provide subsidies that guarantee the financial success of housing 
projects. As a result, candidates for the presidency and seats in Congress were 
able to count on hefty contributions from developers. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that the system was designed to have influence driving it because 
profits are so big and because those on the supply side of housing find it in 
their interest to compete in this way," said Stuart M. Butler, director of 
domestic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington. 
"This is sort of endemic to a system that operates on the thesis that you help 
low-income people get housing by enriching developers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developer Funds 
</P>
<P>
For instance, 70% of the money Carter raised for his reelection campaign in 
Massachusetts in 1979 came from HUD-connected developers. And every developer 
who contributed got a new HUD project, according to a 1980 study by the Boston 
Herald American. 
</P>
<P>
One Carter backer who got new HUD projects under his Administration was Gerard 
F. Doherty, a veteran Boston developer and lawyer, who headed Carter's 1976 
campaign in New York, where he won a crucial victory. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago developer Thomas B. Rosenberg -- who contributed thousands of dollars 
to Carter and raised an estimated $700,000 for the 1984 presidential bid of 
Walter F. Mondale, Carter's vice president -- obtained HUD approval for 35 
housing projects across the country during the Carter years. 
</P>
<P>
Large contributions to Democrats also have helped open doors for A. Bruce 
Rozet, whose Associated Financial Corp. of Santa Monica and various affiliates 
are among the nation's biggest syndicators and managers of HUD housing. 
</P>
<P>
One of Rozet's favorite candidates is Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), whose 
position as chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees housing gives him 
enormous influence at HUD. Rozet and a handful of associates have contributed 
more than $17,000 to Cranston in the last decade, federal election records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence B. Simons, federal housing commissioner under Carter and now a 
Washington lawyer, acknowledged in an interview that political contributions 
helped developers with the Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as you have a democratic process, there is going to be politics," 
Simons said. It was "all part of the political process." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Illegal 
</P>
<P>
This does not mean that the politicians, government officials or developers 
were doing anything illegal. Congressmen argue that HUD projects help their 
constituents. Developers contend that contributions represent support for 
friendly politicians, rather than a nefarious quid pro quo. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted Carter to win because I thought the FHA (Federal Housing 
Administration) would be stronger under Carter than it would under Reagan," 
said Rosenberg, who added that he did not submit another application to HUD 
after Carter lost. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Rozet maintained that his support of Cranston and other Democratic 
candidates stemmed from shared ideals and brought him only a "receptive ear" 
for his ideas on housing. 
</P>
<P>
"What is important is to have input into the legislative process," said Rozet, 
who was appointed by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) to a 
national commission whose report forms the basis for pending legislation to 
extend tax credits for investors in low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
But it does appear that campaign contributions provided access to decision 
makers in the Carter Administration in much the same way that hiring the right 
consultant did in the Reagan era. 
</P>
<P>
Several factors, however, appeared to have lessened the impact of influence 
under Carter compared to Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"The big difference is that the people who were in HUD under the Carter 
Administration had some interest in the subject and were interested in serving 
the constituencies the department worked with -- cities, poor people and the 
housing industry," said Anthony Downs, a senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Couldn't Give a Damn' 
</P>
<P>
"The Reagan Administration put people in HUD who couldn't give a damn about 
housing or HUD policies, and when you put those kinds of people in charge of a 
program, good things don't happen." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the level of HUD funding under Carter was far higher and it was 
easier to help friendly developers without slighting those with no connections. 
HUD housing programs for new construction and major rehabilitation were 
eliminated under Reagan and the department budget was slashed. 
</P>
<P>
Also, local housing authorities had a stronger say in choosing projects in the 
Carter period, which diminished Washington's influence. From 1983 on, a change 
in the law meant that key decisions on awarding the dwindling supply of HUD 
funds were made at headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sort of Popped Up' 
</P>
<P>
"Washington became sort of a bottleneck and some political consultants just 
sort of popped up," said Doherty, who cut back on his HUD involvement during 
the Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the concentration of decision making in Washington and the far smaller 
pool of funds helped spawn a cottage industry of instant consultants, often 
without any housing expertise, who became necessary to get HUD funds. 
</P>
<P>
The role of the consultants appeared to dumbfound Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) 
during the current hearings on HUD when he was questioning a developer who paid 
$300,000 to Watt for bringing her project to the attention of former HUD 
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"You would rather pay $300,000 than ask your senator or congressman?" Frank 
asked Judith Siegel. "The reason I say that is that, you know, sometimes I'm in 
a bad mood and people call me and I'm grumpy, but geez, I never think I'm 
$300,000 grumpy. I mean, I can't imagine that someone would say: 'Well I could 
call my congressman or I could pay 300 grand and boy, he might be in one of his 
moods and I'd rather pay the 300 grand.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I think the system is very bad, too," Siegel responded. 
</P>
<P>
Boston developer John Allen anticipated that Reagan's victory would affect his 
2-year-old effort to obtain HUD financing to turn an abandoned hosiery mill in 
Durham, N.C., into housing for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Norby, Durham's top planning official, recalled in a recent interview that 
Allen had said he would have to "switch aisles" and rely on a partner with 
better Republican ties. 
</P>
<P>
Allen did not return telephone calls to his Boston office. But records show 
that the project languished until Louis Kitchin of Atlanta, a Reagan campaign 
strategist with no housing experience, was hired as a consultant and Durham's 
new Republican mayor, Charles Markham, a one-time associate at the same law 
firm as HUD's Pierce, began actively supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
HUD records and congressional testimony indicate that Pierce ordered a generous 
package of benefits for the project in 1985 over staff objections and despite 
the refusal of his assistant secretary for housing to approve it. 
</P>
<P>
Because Pierce told the House subcommittee that he was not involved in specific 
projects, the Durham decision has emerged as one focus of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
In his congressional testimony on May 25, Pierce tried to shift some of the 
spotlight to Democrats who benefitted through HUD under Carter. He said that, 
when he came to Washington to join the Reagan Cabinet in 1981, lawyers told him 
that HUD funding for new construction was being "sold" for $1,000 to $2,000 a 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Frank -- a former chairman and longtime member of the housing and 
community development subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs Committee -- berated Pierce for bringing up the issue and criticized 
him strongly when the former secretary refused to identify specific Democrats 
who benefited. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Let It Get Worse' 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), who has been an outspoken critic of his own 
party's operation of HUD, said in an interview: "The Reagan Administration had 
its chance eight years ago and instead of ferreting out waste, fraud and abuse 
at HUD, they just let it get worse. There is no doubt in my mind that there 
were abuses in the Carter Administration, but that happened a long time ago and 
we are concentrating on the last three or four years." 
</P>
<P>
He predicted, however, that some Democratic developers may wind up before the 
subcommittee through their use of Republicans "who opened the doors." 
</P>
<P>
Some Democratic developers withdrew from the HUD scene when Reagan was elected 
and others who have remained have taken their lumps. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Scandalous' 
</P>
<P>
During a tour last month of a Washington housing project owned partly by Rozet, 
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp called the complex "scandalous" and threatened to bar 
the owners from doing business with the department if conditions were not 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
Similar criticisms have been aimed at a San Francisco project, Geneva Towers, 
partly owned by Rozet. Robert J. De Monte, HUD regional administrator, vowed in 
an interview to foreclose on the property by September unless the partnership 
makes substantial improvements. 
</P>
<P>
But Rozet blames the Reagan Administration for failing to provide enough money 
for the Washington complex and said that his partners have responsibility for 
improving Geneva Towers. 
</P>
<P>
Since it started in May by examining allegations of favoritism in one HUD 
program between 1983 and 1988, the subcommittee's inquiry has broadened 
dramatically, sometimes using information provided by Democratic developers. 
</P>
<P>
Rozet acknowledged in an interview that he has provided "unsolicited" 
information to members of the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Providing Information 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is relying on me," he said. "They are asking lots of people for help. I 
am merely providing information gratuitously." 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the investigation said that the California developer offered 
a tip about a Florida project involving Republican Carla Anderson Hills, the 
U.S. trade representative and former HUD secretary, who has done legal work for 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
Rozet did say that he has complained to HUD about the project, in which his 
proposal to develop a piece of property in Jacksonville with HUD assistance was 
rejected in favor of one backed by a developer represented by Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before Congress, Hills denied any impropriety in the transaction 
and said that she billed it at the hourly rate she charged legal clients, 
rather than at the $1,000 a unit that was the going rate for consultants during 
the Reagan Administration.

BUSH UPSET AT CONGRESS OVER DEFENSE, S&amp;LS 
</P>

<P>
President Bush expressed frustration Friday with the way Congress has treated 
his legislative agenda, complaining that lawmakers are thwarting his ability to 
negotiate arms control agreements and delaying resolution of the savings and 
loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to negotiate with the Soviet Union without as many cards in my 
hand as possible," said Bush, referring to congressional cuts in his proposed 
defense budget, "so there's an arms control dimension to what we're talking 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's remarks were made during a wide-ranging, 30-minute news conference 
convened to call attention to a switch by Rep. Tommy F. Robinson of Arkansas 
from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vows to Keep Fighting 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday was not the House's most memorable moment," Bush said, citing 
Thursday's House vote on the defense budget. "But we're going to keep fighting 
on for what we believe in." 
</P>
<P>
Bush predicted that his military priorities would survive, even though the 
House chopped funding for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the B-2 Stealth 
bomber and the MX and Midgetman missile programs, all components of what Bush 
described as his "strategic concept." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he also believes he will prevail in final congressional action 
on a proposed multibillion-dollar bailout of the troubled savings and loan 
industry, even though House and Senate negotiators rejected his plan to keep 
the initial cost off the books of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't come to vetoing the S&amp;L (legislation) because we have 40-plus 
votes in the Senate" in favor of the Administration's position, he said. If his 
funding proposal fails, Bush said, "It would send a very bad sign to 
international markets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No High Marks for Congress 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Bush said, he "wouldn't give (Congress) high marks" for the way in 
which it has responded to the Administration's legislative proposals. But he 
insisted that he will not shift to a more confrontational approach and that he 
will still seek cooperation and compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure name-calling or questioning somebody's motives (will) be 
successful," he said. "We have a Democratic majority in the Senate, a 
Democratic majority in the House. I have to work with these people. I will work 
with these people. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been too hot at being a name-caller, and I think they know the 
principles upon which I stand. . . . It's a question of style, I think, and 
I'll take a shot at them once in a while if they get too outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open to Compromise 
</P>
<P>
Bush also indicated that he is still open to compromise with lawmakers on his 
proposal to lower the tax rate on capital gains, which involve sales of assets 
such as stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's some compromise that can spur investment, spur jobs, increase 
employment -- the cause of new jobs starting up -- I'd be interested in it," he 
said. "I don't think I should ever say it's got to be done just this way." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan would reduce the maximum capital gains tax rate to 15%. The 
reduction would apply to stocks and most other income-producing assets, but not 
to timber and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
But a majority of the House Ways and Means Committee appears to be supporting a 
substitute proposal by Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.) to cut the top rate to 20% for 
two years for all assets, then raise it to 28% while ending taxation of gains 
attributable to inflation. Democratic leaders have delayed a vote while 
negotiations continue with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called his plan "a good, solid proposal," saying that he believes "it will 
stimulate jobs" and encourage business creation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supports Lucas 
</P>
<P>
Bush also reiterated his support for former Wayne County, Mich., sheriff and 
county executive William Lucas, his embattled nominee to head the Justice 
Department's civil rights office. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly support Bill Lucas," he said. "I am convinced that much -- not all, 
but much -- of the criticism of him is pure gut American politics. And it 
started long before Day 1 of the hearings. And this is a man that served as a 
Democrat, was widely respected, switched to the Republican Party, and then 
people piled onto a fare-thee-well. He has my confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he had made telephone calls to lawmakers on Lucas' behalf. "I feel 
strongly about it," he said. "And I told Bill last night -- he was over at the 
house for dinner here -- and I told him, 'I am staying with you 100%,' and it's 
going to be right there and solid." 
</P>
<P>
Bush refused to say if he would sign or veto a Democratic-sponsored statute to 
outlaw flag burning, although he still favors a constitutional amendment. "I 
will see what comes down here, but I will continue to push for the approach 
that I think is the best, " he said.

RAID INTO LEBANON DEFENDED BY ISRAEL;

LEADER OF IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH ACCUSED OF ROLE IN TERRORIST ATTACKS

<P>
Israel on Friday defended its daring pre-dawn raid into Lebanon and the 
abduction of a Muslim leader of the militant Hezbollah militia as a necessary 
part of its fight against terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
The target of the raid, Sheik Abdel Kareem Obeid, "was known as a preacher and 
instigator in carrying out attacks against Israel," according to an Israeli 
army spokesman, Col. Ranaan Gissin. "He was the main figure in the (Hezbollah) 
organization especially in southern Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
The army's action immediately sparked threats of retaliation from the 
Iranian-backed Shiite group. 
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel was unmoved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reserves Right to Respond' 
</P>
<P>
"Israel has said several times that when combat against international terrorism 
is at stake, it reserves the right to respond whenever it will find it suitable 
and effective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The raid began in the early morning hours Friday as 25 Israeli helicopter-borne 
commandos landed near the Shiite Muslim village of Jibchit, about 10 miles 
north of the Israeli border. 
</P>
<P>
Obeid, the 36-year-old leader of the militant Hezbollah militia, is both a 
spiritual leader and political chief in the village. 
</P>
<P>
Squads of Israeli jets reportedly staged mock raids nearby to distract 
attention from the helicopter's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The commandos surrounded Obeid's building, then knocked on the door of his 
apartment on the second floor. They pushed their way in when the door was 
opened, waving pistols equipped with silencers. Obeid's wife, Mona, was then 
locked in a room with her hands tied and her mouth taped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Blindfolded My Father' 
</P>
<P>
"They stormed our house and pointed a gun at me and my mother and tied us up. 
Then they blindfolded my father and the two others and took them away," Saged, 
one of Obeid's five children, was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Also seized were Obeid's cousin, Ahmad, and a man identified as Hashem Fahes, a 
friend who was staying at Obeid's house, according to Lebanese police. 
</P>
<P>
A villager, alternately described as a neighbor of Obeid or one of his guards, 
was shot and killed when he looked out his door to see what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
All of the commandos returned safely to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, Hezbollah spiritual leader Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah urged 
Muslims to "stand up to their responsibilities to confront the Israeli crime" 
and to "let out their anger until Obeid is released safely." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Action Condemned 
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the action in a statement. "This shameless 
act by the Zionist regime will not remain unanswered by the Muslim and 
combatant forces." 
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Gissin said that in addition to instigating and planning attacks 
across Israel's border, Obeid provided weapons to Hezbollah guerrillas in 
southern Lebanon and arranged hiding places for those who were carrying out 
attacks on Israeli targets. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Lebanon said Obeid is also suspected of helping to plan the 
February, 1988, abduction of an American, Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, 
who was assigned to a U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Lebanon said Higgins, of Danville, Ky., was held at Obeid's 
apartment for a brief time after his capture. The Oppressed of the Earth, a 
group believed to be linked with Hezbollah, reportedly later took Higgins to 
another hiding place. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush said he did not know if the incident would help 
Higgins or the eight other American hostages. In what appeared to be a veiled 
criticism of the action, he said, "I don't think kidnaping and violence help 
the cause of peace." 
</P>
<P>
The British government condemned the seizure of Obeid and called for his 
release. Several Britons are held hostage in Lebanon; one, Terry Waite, special 
envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury, was kidnaped in January, 1987, while on 
a mission to free other hostages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticism Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, also defended the army 
action and dismissed criticism from Britain and others. 
</P>
<P>
"This sheik is one of the most dangerous terrorists in south Lebanon, 
personally responsible for bloodshed and a great number of terrorist attacks 
against Israeli targets," he said. "I do not remember the same indignation and 
condemnation coming from Britain when those despicable acts were conducted 
against us." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli government radio, quoting military sources, said the daring arrest of 
Obeid and the two other men might hasten the release of three Israeli soldiers 
believed to be held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is reported to hold several foreign hostages, 
including at least two Israeli soldiers.

'A Certain Leverage' 
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Gissin fueled the speculation, saying: "Clearly, when you 
capture one of their top leaders, it can deter terrorism, and you also have a 
certain amount of leverage in your hands." 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1986, two soldiers were captured by Hezbollah in Israel's 
self-declared "security zone" in southern Lebanon. The third Israeli, a downed 
pilot, reportedly is being held by the Shiite Amal militia. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication Friday night that the capture of Obeid was directly 
related to the case of Higgins.

On the long flight from Chicago to Hawaii, a young woman whiles away the hours 
by stringing a lei of pearl-white shells. At the Honolulu airport, a little boy 
holds a lei of fragrant yellow blossoms as he eagerly watches for his mother. 
"I made it myself," he says shyly. At the gate, a tour guide welcomes his group 
with leis made of carnations and tiny orchids. "Aloha!" he greets them. 
"Welcome to Hawaii!" 
</P>
<P>
The lei is so much a part of Hawaii's image that it is surprising to learn that 
it, along with other traditions of the islands, was disappearing 40 years ago. 
When Marie MacDonald began her career with the state Department of Parks and 
Recreation in 1952, she was one of a few recreation teachers and professionals 
determined to revitalize the arts of Hawaii. "We grew up making leis," 
MacDonald said with a smile, "but I had so much to learn!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passing on the Skill 
</P>
<P>
Today, MacDonald is renowned as an expert on the leis of Hawaii, and her 
students' students continue to pass on her knowledge and enthusiasm. This 
summer, she joined dozens of other tradition-bearers in sharing the state's 
rich heritage with visitors to the Smithsonian Institution's Festival of 
American Folklife in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
The Polynesians who first settled the Hawaiian Islands 15 centuries ago brought 
with them the tradition of making leis from natural materials at hand -- seeds, 
shells, teeth, feathers and plants. The years that followed brought explorers, 
visitors and settlers from South America, Europe, Asia and North America, and 
"any time anybody introduced something to the islands," MacDonald says, 
"somebody made a lei out of it." 
</P>
<P>
The lei became important in Hawaiian religion, music, poetry and lore. 
Preparing the lei remains a key part of the hula ritual. Today, the lei 
tradition belongs to everyone in the state, whether their forebears were 
Hawaiian or came from Japan, China, Puerto Rico, Okinawa, Samoa, Southern 
California or all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Social Significance 
</P>
<P>
Leis are offered to welcome a stranger or a friend, to celebrate holidays, 
weddings and birthdays and to honor the dead. Hawaiian cowboys wear leis in 
parades and rodeos and just for the fun of it. At prom time, a boy gives his 
date a lei to match her gown, and at commencement time, graduates are showered 
with leis "to the eyebrows," MacDonald says. 
</P>
<P>
Each lei-making technique has its challenges. Hili is simple braiding of a 
single material. In haku, the most difficult, the lei maker braids ferns or 
other leaves and mounts flowers in the plait. A wili lei is bound with a thread 
of hibiscus bark or raffia. A kipu'u lei is knotted; a humupapa is sewn to a 
base of bark or fabric. And there are many, many variations of stringing the 
lei kui. 
</P>
<P>
Lei makers have a vast array of materials from which to choose, and since 
Hawaii has virtually no seasons, buds, blossoms, fruits and leaves of any given 
plant are available year-round. Many of the native species are now rare, so 
MacDonald encourages her students to grow their own materials in lei gardens. 
"Orchids, carnations and other things you can buy in the supermarket," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shells as Flowers 
</P>
<P>
This profusion of flowers is lacking only on arid Ni'ihau, a private island. 
"So, for centuries, the shell has been the flower of Ni'ihau," says Linda 
Moriarty, coordinator of the Smithsonian's program. During the winter months, 
Pacific storms churn up the tiny shells that wash ashore on the island's 
beaches. The shells of Ni'ihau are not unusual, Moriarty says, but their 
abundance and quality are unmatched. Beachcombers can gather a cupful of shells 
on a good day and store them for summer lei-making. 
</P>
<P>
Many shells are discarded or damaged during the process of sorting, cleaning 
and piercing for stringing. The islanders have words for the subtle differences 
in color that develop as shells are tumbled in surf and bleached by the sun. 
The most valued shells are the pearl-white momi. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, shells were strung on the green cotton thread used to make 
fishing nets, the tips of the strings stiffened with beeswax. Nowadays, nylon 
or polyester thread and quick-drying cement are used. There are many styles of 
stringing, some named for flowers. A traditional wedding lei of 20 strands, 
each 60 inches long, contains 6,000 carefully selected shells. A bride's 
friends might work for a year to produce such a lei, Moriarty says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Blossoms Stacked 
</P>
<P>
If there is a king or queen of the floral leis, it is the ilima. This 
deceptively simple, golden garland inspired the familiar paper leis. Hundreds 
of tiny, fragile blossoms are opened and stacked to form a round strand. Ilima 
were so valued that for centuries, the Hawaiian monarchs accepted them as 
payment for taxes. Receiving one today is a great honor. "It will last through 
the day and then wither," MacDonald said, but the fragrance lingers and the 
memory lasts forever. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in making traditional leis, materials are chosen first for fragrance 
-- "better than French perfume," MacDonald said. Then there is the color 
scheme, which may be brilliant or subtle. Many lovely leis are made from 
greenery. The lei maker also considers texture and the way the material will 
feel against the wearer's skins. Movement is very important in a lei to be worn 
by a hula dancer or as a headdress. "They are very intriguing and graceful, and 
enhance the beauty of men and women," MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
The least important aspect of a lei is how long it will last. This is a concept 
that escapes many tourists, who are often heard asking how to preserve one. 
"Some Westerners have trouble understanding that the meaning of the lei is in 
the making and giving," MacDonald said, "perhaps because they live in such a 
plastic world." Indeed, some do settle for leis made of artificial flowers. She 
cringes at the thought. "Sure, make leis out of plastic beads or shapes, but 
please, oh please, don't make plastic imitations!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Fragile Expression 
</P>
<P>
"The lei is an expression of love, affection, respect or honor," she explained. 
"It's the most beautiful thing I can make, from the most beautiful material at 
hand. As long as the lei is at its peak when I give it to you, it shows that I 
care." 
</P>
<P>
Westerners are also often uncomfortable with the idea of men wearing flowers, 
MacDonald noted. "For the Pacific man, the more flowers the better," she said. 
"One paniolo (cowboy) summed it up when he said: 'We like to show off. The 
girls all look at you when you wear a lei!' My husband, a Virginian, got so in 
tune with the custom that he often wore a lei on his hat while working with his 
Pam Am ground crew." 
</P>
<P>
For a cowboy, a hat lei has its practical side -- it keeps the hat from blowing 
off. Old-time paniolo tell MacDonald of making leis on the way home, sometimes 
gathering the materials "at full gallop, for the fun of it." One paniolo 
confided to MacDonald that he relied on his lei to show his wife that he had 
really been out in the high pasture and not off gallivanting. 
</P>
<P>
The paniolo are great lovers of another lei tradition, the feather hat band, 
descended from the feather leis once worn by Hawaiian royalty. Tsugi Kaiama, 
another festival participant, has been making feather leis for 51 of her 75 
years. "I thought I would retire," she said, but the customers keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiama gets her feathers from hunters who come to the Big Island ranches to 
shoot pheasant, peafowl, quail and other game birds. "They only want the meat, 
so they give me the skins," Kaiama says. The plumage is so varied that an 
infinite number of patterns are possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Some leis can be completed in a few days," she said. She then pointed to a 
simple band of perfectly matched, iridescent blue neck feathers from Chinese 
ringnecked pheasants. "That one took six months," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feather Leis Saved 
</P>
<P>
Fine feather leis are kept and handed down for generations, but Kaiama fears 
that hers is a dying art. Younger lei makers lack the patience, she said. "They 
calculate in their minds, 'so much an hour,' but we're not making money, we're 
making feather leis. You must love to do this." She has high hopes for her 
grandniece, a fourth-grader "who can sit beside me for hours." Like MacDonald, 
Moriarty and other lovers of Hawaiian tradition, Kaiama wishes to pass the gift 
of the lei to future generations. 
</P>
<P>
Lei Day is May 1. In Honolulu's Kapiolani Park, people crowd in front of the 
winner of the mayor's grand prize, a lei of deep green laua'e fern leaves 
fashioned into hundreds of rosettes, each no bigger than the tip of a pinkie. 
The winner, a Vietnamese who came to Hawaii in 1979, says he learned "by 
watching." 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators show how to make leis of every description. There are leis made 
from silk, roses, glossy black candlenuts, paper clips, candy, cigarette papers 
-- and plastic six-pack holders. One woman creates intricate patterns from seed 
pods. A friend sits down to admire the work. "Will you make one for me?" she 
asks. The answer is a smile and a shake of the head. "I'm not gonna make for 
you. You gonna learn do yo' own!" They pick up the needles, and the lesson 
begins.

SMITHS GO HAMMER AND TONGS FOR WORLD TITLE IN CALGARY 
</P>

<P>
They came from 10 nations -- 54 brawny blacksmiths all in their 20s, 30s and 
40s except one, Jay Sharp, 68, of Salmon, Ida., the "grand old man of 
horseshoeing," to compete in the 10th-annual World Championship Blacksmiths' 
Competition. 
</P>
<P>
They pulled red-hot steel from coal-fired forges that spiraled dense clouds of 
smoke under a big tent at the Calgary Stampede. They shaped the glowing steel 
into horseshoes with tongs and hammers. 
</P>
<P>
The sound of hammers clanged against anvils as farriers spent four days 
competing with one another in a dozen different events earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
They had come from Australia, Canada, England, Germany, Norway, Scotland, 
Sweden, Switzerland, the United States and Wales for this Super Bowl, World 
Series and Wimbledon of smiths. One Californian, Lee Green, 28, of Yucaipa, was 
among the contestants. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was Sharp, a living legend among farriers throughout the world, 
three-time winner of the World Champion Forging Award, reputed to be the best 
manufacturer of blacksmith tools on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to give me a senior citizen bonus," chortled Sharp between puffs on 
his pipe. "Everyone I'm competing against is young enough to be my son, 
grandson or great-grandson." 
</P>
<P>
After all the fires in the portable forges were extinguished, after the smoke 
cleared and the clanging ceased, Grant Moon, 26, a native of Wales, who 
emigrated to Peaster, Tex., three years ago, was declared 1989 World Champion 
Blacksmith and winner too of this year's World Champion forging award. 
</P>
<P>
The World Champion Blacksmith title was for forging and shoeing, the World 
Champion Forging Award strictly for specific forging competition. Allan Ferrie, 
32, of Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, Scotland, was barely nosed out by Moon. 
</P>
<P>
As World Champion Blacksmith, Moon won $1,000 and the coveted silver horseshoe 
nail presented by Mustad, a 157-year-old Swedish firm, the world's largest 
producer of horseshoe nails, sponsor of the competition. He won another $1,000 
and a hand-crafted Jay Sharp striking hammer for being the World Forging 
Champion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharp Understudies 
</P>
<P>
Sharp also presented a punch used for clipping toes of horses to the top 
blacksmiths from each of the 10 competing countries. "The grand old man of 
horseshoeing" handcrafted the toe clips at his back-yard blacksmith shop. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the farriers in the competition have understudied the old master at his 
school for advanced forging. Shayne Carter, now 28, from Draper, Utah, the 1984 
World Champion Blacksmith, was a Sharp prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to the United States in 1986 to spend three weeks with Jay at his place 
in Idaho solely to enhance my chances of winning the World Championship 
Blacksmith title," said Magne Delebekk, 28, of Kvastebyen, Norway. This was the 
fifth time Delebekk has flown to the Calgary Stampede from Norway for the 
blacksmith competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the blacksmith tools used by the smiths in the World 
Championship were hand-crafted by Sharp in his one-man shop in the tiny Idaho 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp makes pritchels to punch holes in horseshoes, fullering hammers to make 
creases in the shoes, fire tongs, toe clips, rounding hammers and various other 
tools used in shoeing horses. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a farrier since he was 13, shoeing his first horse on a ranch in 
the Whitetank Mountains of Arizona. He rodeoed. He cowboyed. He spent four 
years in the Navy in World War II. But most of his life has been devoted to 
forging tools and shoeing horses. 
</P>
<P>
He has a year of back orders for his tools from farriers throughout the United 
States and 27 foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stubborn as a Mule' 
</P>
<P>
"Jay is stubborn as a mule. He refuses to hire any help. He bangs away on his 
anvil seven days a week from sunup to sundown," said Rachel Sharp, his wife of 
15 years. "I got him chained to his anvil. I let him off for lunch and dinner," 
she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
She is Sharp's sixth wife and has outlasted the other five, his longest 
previous marriage being seven years. Sharp said he never leaves his blacksmith 
shop except for the four days each year he comes to the Calgary Stampede for 
the championship competition. 
</P>
<P>
Of about 40,000 farriers in the United States, 18 were entered in the World 
Championship this year, with a like number from Canada. Bob Marshall of 
Mission, British Columbia, has won the World Champion blacksmith title five 
times; Dave Duckett and now Grant Moon, both Americans, have each won it twice. 
</P>
<P>
For the spectators the variety of competitive events were fascinating to watch. 
The "Eagle Eye," for example, saw all 54 contestants allowed 10 seconds each to 
study the same hoof of the same horse, then required from memory to make a shoe 
to fit that hoof within a 15-minute time limit. Judging was based on accuracy 
and fit of the shoe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wide Selection of Shoes 
</P>
<P>
The international competition used a wide range of horseshoes in the various 
events, including German lateral, Welsh mining, mule shoes, Belgian hind, cow 
hocked, Swiss side weight and French trotting horse. 
</P>
<P>
The total prize money amounted to $7,800. Only Grant Moon, who won a total of 
$3,000 for the two top titles and in other competition, made enough to pay 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Blacksmithing is an art dating back to when man first used steel and rode 
horses. Competition among blacksmiths possibly has been going on since then. A 
famous Norman Rockwell cover on the Saturday Evening Post in the 1930s showed 
blacksmiths competing at a county fair. 
</P>
<P>
But the competition at the Calgary Stampede, the Great Western outdoor show, 
matches the top smiths from around the world, including, in particular, "the 
grand old man of horseshoeing."

JOLTS LINKED TO SONIC BOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents from Long Beach to San Clemente reported a series of window-rattling 
jolts, but authorities said the shaking was probably caused by sonic booms and 
not an earthquake. Robert Finn, a spokesman at Caltech, said that no seismic 
activity was recorded in the area, and he theorized that the jolts resulted 
from sonic booms or Navy gunfire. A spokesman for the Naval Station at Long 
Beach said it was possible that ships were conducting bombing exercises near 
San Clemente Island and this could have caused the rattling about 2 p.m. Police 
and fire authorities received several calls from residents concerned about the 
jolts, but there were no reports of damages. Border Patrol Agent Howard 
Schroeder said that the windows in his San Clemente office "rattled real bad" 
but that the jolts did not resemble those of an earthquake.

DOMINICAN READIES 'LIGHTHOUSE TO COLUMBUS'

<P>
Near this capital city, a gigantic, cross-shaped laser beam that will be 
visible for miles all over the Caribbean is being readied for the 500th 
anniversary of Christopher Columbus' historic arrival in the New World. 
</P>
<P>
But residents of this island nation, which the explorer first sighted in 1492, 
aren't universally taken with President Joaquin Balaguer's "Lighthouse to 
Columbus" and other preparations being made for the 1992 anniversary. Entire 
neighborhoods have been bulldozed to make way for tourist hotels and 
restaurants, museums and highways, giving rise to sharp protests from those 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
One of the ironies of the anniversary preparations is the enormous amount of 
electricity the Columbus Lighthouse will consume -- in a land that suffers from 
a chronic power shortage and frequent blackouts and where people in outlying 
areas often have to depend on candlelight. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy expenditures on public works have generated large government budget 
deficits, and many economists blame the shortfall for last year's 50% inflation 
rate. The minimum wage of about $80 a month barely covers basic necessities. 
</P>
<P>
The government says that the ambitious projects are meant to spruce up the 
country for the expected tourist influx. Officials point out that tourism is 
now the country's economic lifeline, replacing the traditional money-earner, 
sugar exports. 
</P>
<P>
The lighthouse's defenders say the island needs to exploit its current boom as 
a tourist hotspot with modern services. And Balaguer regularly appears at 
ceremonies to inaugurate apartments, roads, and bridges and to argue that it 
helps the infrastructure for development. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, community groups are digging in their heels to resist further 
demolition such as that which has left Mirador Park, an area near the 
lighthouse, looking like a battleground. 
</P>
<P>
"Every poor person in this city is faced with the threat of displacement," says 
Nicolas Guevara of the Committee to Defend Neighborhood Rights (Copadeba). "The 
project engineers promise them new homes," he says. But once their old homes 
are demolished, residents find that the promised new homes have been given to 
someone else. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the 500th anniversary committee, Jose Chez Checo, denies the 
charge. "There have been problems with some projects, but near the lighthouse 
area the displaced persons have been moved back into the new residences," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Extensions of major traffic arteries also are scheduled to plow through crowded 
barrios. 
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that this is a conscious plan to remove poor people from the 
city," Guevara says. "The tourist industry wants them out for aesthetic 
reasons, and the government wants to remove centers of protest." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the affected zones were, in fact, hotbeds of activism in 1984 when more 
than 100 people died in rioting over price increases of basic necessities. 
</P>
<P>
Affected residents say the officials' main aim is to pressure people to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked me if I wanted money or a shack," relates Salvador Rincon, who 
refused a cash payment of $700 for his demolished house. He now lives with his 
family of five in a precarious hut next to an open sewer while awaiting a 
promised apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"How could I take a couple of pesos and end up in the street?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
The Copadeba group has managed to modify some demolition and change government 
procedures in others. Ismaela Jimenez de Blanco fought the authorities for a 
written promise of new housing before giving up her home: "They wanted me to 
just accept their verbal promises, but I said they could knock down the house 
on top of me first." 
</P>
<P>
Many Dominicans say that corrupt officials accept bribes to locate families in 
the new homes. The Roman Catholic archbishop of Santo Domingo, Nicolas de Jesus 
Lopez Rodrigues, confirmed that the country's bureaucratic practices are 
dubious. Dominican justice, he said in a February speech, is "in the hands of 
drug dealers and thieves." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, critics say, the government is building too much, too fast. 
</P>
<P>
"They have put too much money into circulation," says former President Juan 
Bosch, a candidate to replace Balaguer in next year's election. "This county 
needs industrialization, not more dependence on foreign tourists." (The army 
ousted Bosch in 1963. When civil war broke out two years later, U.S. military 
forces intervened to impose a truce while Balaguer was put in office.) 
</P>
<P>
The government scoffs at criticism of its plans, particularly for the 
lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Every great project of human imagination has had its naysayers," declares 
Technical Secretary Guillermo Caram, ticking off "the Panama Canal, the Eiffel 
Tower, the Palace of Versailles." "But Versailles, for example, was later the 
site of great triumphs of mankind -- the French Revolution, the 1918 armistice, 
the founding of the League of Nations," he says. "Despite the criticism, the 
authors of these works left their stamp on history."

A New Orleans group that tried unsuccessfully to open a radio station has filed 
a malpractice suit against Thomas Root, the Washington lawyer involved in a 
bizarre air odyssey that ended with his crash in the Bahamas earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The suit filed Thursday in state District Court in New Orleans accuses Root of 
legal malpractice when representing a group seeking a Federal Communications 
Commission license for a radio station in nearby Belle Chasse earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said Root lied about certain things and failed to attend to details in 
the licensing procedures. Root also told other groups vying for the license 
that his group planned to drop their application, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to get the license failed and the group, called the Belle Chasse 
Radio Limited Partnership, is asking for $125,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Root had told the station's investors that they would get a $125,000 settlement 
for pulling out their application and then he allowed their application to be 
dismissed, the suit alleged.

NEW LAW MAKES EASY PICKINGS OF MAINE'S BLUEBERRY RUSTLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The rustlers are having a field day in Maine's blueberry patches, where $1 
million worth of berries may be purloined in a year. But a new state law gives 
police the power to catch the thieves blue-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Teams of blueberry thieves who arrive in pickup trucks and disperse through the 
fields overnight can pick enough berries to fill dozens of 24-pound boxes, 
according to Bob Phillips, president of Jasper Wyman &amp; Son of Milbridge, 
which harvests wild blueberries on 7,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that continued thievery would hurt their harvests this summer, the 
berry industry turned to the Legislature earlier this year, and the resulting 
berry bill was signed into law by Gov. John R. McKernan. It is designed to give 
authorities the tools to track down the illegal pickers and end the black 
market -- make that blue market -- in berries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picking Permits 
</P>
<P>
The law requires pickers to get written permission from landowners, and anyone 
who transports 25 pounds or more of berries must get a numbered permit from the 
Maine Blueberry Commission. Packers and shippers also must keep records of the 
blueberries they receive in lots of 25 pounds or more. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the law authorizes police, sheriffs, forest rangers and game wardens 
to make inspections and arrests, and to investigate blueberry thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Blueberries are a $70-million-a-year industry in Maine, one of the leading 
blueberry-producing states, Ed McLaughlin of the blueberry commission said. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin said the theft problem is worst when the price is highest. He 
estimated losses during the 1988 season at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Suspects confronted by Wyman employees typically claim that they took the 
berries from someone else's field, Phillips said. Others spotted in the act can 
easily get away on the dirt roads that wind through the hilly barrens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commercial Motive 
</P>
<P>
"These people are doing it for money," Phillips said. He added that organized 
thieves tend to go where the berries grow best. "It's a big business." 
</P>
<P>
While people in the blueberry business say the law was a long time coming, some 
casual roadside pickers believe the state has gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
"For heaven's sake! The most I would ever take is three or four quarts," said 
one woman who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"They've roped off all of the good blueberry patches. I'm miffed. I'll just 
have to sneak in after dark."

JAPAN, TAIWAN ASSAILED ON 'DESTRUCTIVE' FISHING; 
</P>
<P>
15 NATIONS SEEK BAN ON DRIFT NETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID CLARK SCOTT, Christian Science Monitor 
</P>

<P>
TARAWA, Kiribati 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Momentum is building for a global ban on the controversial practice of 
drift-net fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen South Pacific nations have launched a stinging verbal and diplomatic 
attack on Japan and Taiwan for "indiscriminate, irresponsible, and destructive" 
drift-net fishing. 
</P>
<P>
The "Tarawa Declaration," produced earlier this month at the 20th South Pacific 
Forum in Kiribati, calls for a drift-net-free zone in this region followed by a 
concerted push for a worldwide ban. 
</P>
<P>
It also praises Korea for recently vowing to stop its fishing boats from using 
drift-nets. 
</P>
<P>
Similar to the Assn. of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the forum is the 
major political organization in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Drift-net fishing dominated discussions at this year's annual gathering of 
South Pacific leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Drift, or "gill," net fishing involves laying strings of nets 30-feet deep and 
20 to 30 miles long. The massive nets are left to drift overnight and then 
retrieved. About 1,000 Japanese and Taiwanese fishing boats use the nets, 
ostensibly, to catch squid in the North Pacific. A fleet of 190 (two-thirds 
from Taiwan) came to the South Pacific last season to catch tuna. 
</P>
<P>
But the small-mesh nylon nets snare, and often kill, almost all marine life -- 
dolphins, sea birds, whales and turtles. Environmentalists dub them "walls of 
death." 
</P>
<P>
In June, under the threat of U.S. trade sanctions, Japan and Taiwan agreed 
separately to increased monitoring and enforcement of restrictions on drift-net 
fishing in the North Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan agreement -- which was reached a few days after the U.S. Coast Guard 
went on a three-day, 600-mile chase after a Taiwanese boat -- is the tougher of 
the two. It requires transmitters on 10% of the boats this year so they can be 
tracked by satellite, with 100% coverage by next year. It also allows U.S. 
officials to board vessels suspected of violating the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Canadian and U.S. fishermen in coastal waters have pushed 
for a drift-net ban. They say Asian boats are reducing the salmon catch in 
territorial waters by overfishing the migratory juvenile fish in international 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, South Pacific countries claim, the drift-net boats took two to three 
times the sustainable yield of young albacore tuna last year from a major 
fishing ground east of New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
If this catch rate continues, Forum fishery scientists said, a stock vital to 
tiny island-nation economies could be destroyed in two years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously unacceptable that you can have a practice which . . . if 
continued will wipe out the resource," said Australia's Prime Minister Bob 
Hawke, who initiated the ban. 
</P>
<P>
On such a sensitive domestic issue as fishing, Japan said it cannot move 
without more research. "To take a drastic measure like total banning of 
existing fishing operations we need very concrete data," said Kiyoshi Araki, 
director of the Oceania Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
How long will it take to gather the data? "Maybe one or two years," Araki said. 
He also admitted the tuna caught is primarily for export, not to meet domestic 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
As a Tongan official wryly commented recently, by the time Japan finishes its 
research, the fish will be gone.

CARIBBEAN CARNIVALS -- A MAGICAL BLEND OF DIVERSE CULTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ST. THOMAS, Smithsonian News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Behind the Caribbean's sandy beaches, palm trees and fruity rum drinks is a 
festival waiting to happen. A festival, Caribbean style, is part street party, 
part masquerade and part jam session. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers to Trinidad know that a Caribbean festival is not a spectator sport. 
Unlike an American parade, where people line the sidewalks watching the bands 
march and majorettes twirl, audience participation is part and parcel of 
Caribbean festivals. When a Carnival band goes by, playing its infectious 
calypso or steel-band music, the audience jumps in and dances in the street 
with the music makers. 
</P>
<P>
"The music almost forces you to participate," said singer and poet Hollis 
(Flash) Lashley, a native of Trinidad who lives in Silver Spring, Md. "It's 
what our Caribbean culture is all about. The movement and music and color of a 
festival are an integral part of who we are and how we live." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Take Festivals Along 
</P>
<P>
These festivals have become such an important part of peoples' lives in the 
Caribbean that they don't leave home without them. Wherever West Indians settle 
in large numbers, their festivals are likely to follow. Brooklyn, Toronto, 
Baltimore, Boston and London have all been host to Caribbean festivals. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Smithsonian Institution is recognizing these annual events 
as an art and as the cultural expressions of the people of the Caribbean in a 
new exhibition, "Caribbean Festival Arts," continuing until Feb. 15, 1990. The 
exhibition, originally organized by the St. Louis Art Museum, is complemented 
by dozens of special events, including live performances of calypso and 
steel-band music, crafts and costume-making demonstrations, films and 
educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
"In presenting three festivals -- Junkanoo, Carnival and Hosay from Trinidad 
and Tobago -- we hope to give North American audiences a sense of the Caribbean 
culture," Vera Hyatt, the Smithsonian's project director for the exhibition, 
said. "The essence of this culture is a synthesis of many influences: African, 
English, French, Indian and Spanish. A kind of cross-fertilization took place 
in the islands of the West Indies and the result is a culture that is unique to 
the Caribbean." 
</P>
<P>
In the exhibit, as in a real-life festival, the dominant themes are music and 
masquerade. Music is at the heart of any festival, whether it is reggae in 
Jamaica or French songs in Haiti or steel bands in Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
European Influences 
</P>
<P>
Original Carnival music can be traced to European influences -- to minstrel 
bands and court music. The African sounds of drums were introduced in the 17th 
Century when millions of African slaves worked on the sugar-cane plantations 
dotting the islands. 
</P>
<P>
Calypso was introduced in the mid-1800s in Trinidad where slaves sang the 
call-and-response songs and humorous ditties of their African homelands. 
Today's soca, popular music combining calypso and American soul, began in 1975 
with the release of two recordings, "Sweet Music" and "Endless Vibration" by 
singer Lord Shorty. 
</P>
<P>
Reggae originated in the mid-1960s as a music of the Jamaican poor. The 
distinctive sound of reggae's loud electric bass with organ, piano and drums, 
was popularized in the United States in the early 1970s in the film "The Harder 
They Come," starring singer Jimmy Cliff, and through tours of Bob Marley and 
the Wailers. 
</P>
<P>
But the drum provides the pulse of all Caribbean music, and nowhere is that 
more obvious than in the steel band. The pan or steel drum tradition goes back 
to the drums of Africa. When the Trinidad government banned drums in 1883 on 
the grounds that they were loud and disruptive, the "tambour bamboo" bands 
played on, using bamboo cylinders similar to the African Shango drum ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Found' Instruments 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years later, bands were experimenting with an array of "found 
instruments" -- including kettles, salt boxes and paint cans -- to give louder, 
stronger sounds. 
</P>
<P>
On V-E Day, May 8, 1945, everything from trash cans to biscuit tins was fair 
game for the drummers rejoicing in the streets. One year later, a new device 
arrived on the Carnival scene -- the 55-gallon oil drum, used to ship 
Venezuelan oil to refineries in Trinidad, Aruba, Curacao and other Caribbean 
islands. The unique sound qualities of the oil drums and their availability 
made them immediately -- and lastingly -- popular. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some say that Carnival without pan would be like nature without color. 
Journalist Knolly Moses, a Trinidadian living in New York City, occasionally 
plays pan and describes the experience this way: "A veil is lifted and it takes 
everyone over. It's almost as if I'm possessed. The music is that powerful. Our 
goal is to bring everyone together with our music." 
</P>
<P>
The costume of masquerade of festivals is also steeped in traditions that can 
be traced to the days of slavery and rule by European colonists. Jamaica's 
Junkanoo traditionally celebrated in late December, today is often presented on 
important state occasions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Masks Came in Handy 
</P>
<P>
Junkanoo is the perfect illustration of African and European influences, 
according to Judith Bettelheim, co-curator of "Caribbean Festival Arts" and 
professor of art at San Francisco State University. The masks worn during 
festivals came in handy during the years before emancipation, she said, since 
slaves could make fun of their owners during festivals while remaining 
anonymous behind their disguises. 
</P>
<P>
Costumes are also essential to Carnival, and today many people begin planning 
next year's creation the minute this year's festival is over. 
</P>
<P>
Masquerade bands number from 100 to 5,000 members; a band leader sets the theme 
for his group, which can be literally anything under the sun -- from sailors to 
extraterrestrials. A 1981 band, "Jungle Fever," organized by Trinidad's Peter 
Minshall, required 2,500 costumes, 15 seamstresses and more than two dozen 
painters and decorators. The band's most spectacular costume measured 15-by-2O 
feet and sparkled with 220,000 hand-stitched sequins. Regardless of theme, the 
bands' most elaborate masquerades are made of wire structures covered with 
brilliantly colored and decorated fabric. 
</P>
<P>
The costumes and bands are different every year but, according to poet Lashley, 
a veteran of more than 20 Carnivals, a traditional Carnival will include at 
least one American Indian, a sailor and a casual, randomly costumed Ole Mas 
(Masquerade) band. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costumes a Treasure 
</P>
<P>
Roslyn Ledley, who lives in Brooklyn, N.Y., said she began wearing costumes at 
Carnival as a child when she would "dress in a little nonsense." She now 
treasures her costumes. "I feel so good because other people can see what we 
can do with a few pieces of material," Ledley said. "We make these costumes 
come alive in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Exhibition curator John Nunley of the St. Louis Art Museum sees the costumes 
themselves as art. "These modern urban costume designers," he said, "are 
artists who use non-traditional objects -- tinsel, aluminum, mirrors and bottle 
caps -- to fashion their masquerades, which remind me of dancing mobiles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the almost magical combination of music and masquerade that makes these 
festivals unique," Nunley added. "The costumes are a visual art but the rhythm 
and beat of the music is what draws people into the celebration." 
</P>
<P>
Trinidad hosts what one guidebook calls the "granddaddy of all festivals." 
Carnival-goers begin preparation in January when costumes are designed and 
steel-band rehearsals begin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
King and Queen Named 
</P>
<P>
On the Friday before Carnival, celebrated during the week before Ash Wednesday, 
contests are held to select the king and queen. On Saturday, thousands of 
schoolchildren play mas on the streets of Port-of-Spain and that evening the 
steel-band competition, or Pan-O-Rama, is held. Bands play through the night 
and on Sunday in preparation for Jouvay (from the French for opening day) 
Monday, when bands parade through the streets of the city to Independence 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Carnival's grand finale, the air is filled with the sounds of 
soca, calypso and steel bands as the revelers parade over an outdoor stage to 
show off their costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Carnival is as unique to Trinidad as Junkanoo is to Jamaica. But, in their own 
ways, they are unifying events. "The festivals of these islands are what bring 
the various elements of the diverse cultures together," the Smithsonian's Hyatt 
said. "It is the one art form that cuts across the social and economic 
stratification that is so prevalent in the Caribbean."

Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said Friday that he asked 
the Food and Drug Administration to consider major changes in government food 
labeling standards. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is expected to propose a federal rule on the various aspects of food 
labeling early next year. The agency has long required labeling listing 
ingredients, net weight and nutritional information on foods. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said there is no comprehensive, mandatory food labeling requirement 
for nutritional labeling for all foods, despite the government's efforts to 
improve food labeling.

BOOZE-FREE DANCES APPEAL TO TEETOTALERS

Dance music pulses through the mirrored, Art Deco-style nightclub as the 
bartenders hurriedly stir, shake and blend exotic refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of adults is partying this Friday night, but they are all sober. There 
is no alcohol in the drinks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major nightclub. It has everything but the booze," said Joseph W. 
Perugini, one of the managers of Club Soda, a no-alcohol alternative for adults 
who want to socialize without drinking on Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people out there that just can't drink, and they have nowhere to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Many night spots offer dancing in an alcohol-free club ambience for teen-agers, 
but a boozeless bar for adults is unusual, Perugini's partner, Thomas Rowlay, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We could pack them in with kids, but at the same time, that's not what we were 
looking for," Rowlay said. 
</P>
<P>
On other nights of the week Club Soda is the Night Life VIP Lounge, a 
full-service bar. The decision not to serve booze on Friday nights, typically a 
busy night for bars, was something personal to Perugini, who is a recovering 
alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fun Without Drinking 
</P>
<P>
"I'm recovering, and I've met, through my past two years out there, a different 
breed of people (who) enjoy life without the sauce," Perugini said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just tired of reading, 'Just say no to drugs and say no to booze.' You've 
got to do something. Anybody can say that; it's time we show people how to 
live. I feel real good about it." 
</P>
<P>
Perugini credits Night Life owners Pat Scarpa and Dave DeStazio, his employers 
for a number of years, with giving the no-booze night a chance. 
</P>
<P>
It's an idea that Night Life beverage manager Lester J. Szmajlo endorses. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got people that maybe shouldn't be drinking, that don't want to drink 
and are off the sauce, who want to come out and have that same atmosphere, a 
party night, and not get drunk," Szmajlo said. 
</P>
<P>
Does the lack of alcohol mean a dull crowd? No, according to Club Soda's two 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like 'Is there life without drinking?' Yeah, there sure is," Rowlay said. 
"The important thing is, people who don't drink are no different from people 
who do -- I mean in terms of dullness -- because you have some people who don't 
drink who are dull and you have some people who do drink who are dull."

CIVIC GROUPS LEADER AND SONS HELD IN AUSTRIAN JAIL; 
</P>
<P>
PROMINENT FAMILY FIGHTS EXTRADITION ON POT CHARGES

Linda Leary was president of civic groups and donated time to causes -- to all 
appearances a well-to-do, community-minded woman. 
</P>
<P>
One son, Paul Heilbrunn, was a commodities broker and columnist for a local 
business journal. The other, Richard Heilbrunn, lived on a farm outside town. 
</P>
<P>
But all three now are being held in an Austrian jail, fighting extradition to 
face charges they ran a marijuana-smuggling ring so big that authorities say 
the people hired to count money were told to not bother with $1 bills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrested in May 
</P>
<P>
Leary and her sons left the United States in 1985, two years before their 
November, 1987, indictment. They weren't arrested until May -- Leary was 
released but re-arrested this month after the U.S. government protested -- and 
attorneys on both sides of the case say it could be years before they are 
tried. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point it's completely in the hands of the Austrian government," said 
Deputy U.S. Attorney John Thar. "Obviously, I would feel better if I were in 
control, but that's just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four people were named in the 136-page indictment outlining what federal 
authorities said was one of the largest marijuana-smuggling rings ever 
uncovered. It allegedly touched 11 states and moved at least 250,000 pounds of 
marijuana; employees counted as much as $15 million at a time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Likely to Flee 
</P>
<P>
The family knew it was under investigation -- Paul Heilbrunn had testified 
before a grand jury -- so "it wasn't terribly surprising that they fled," said 
U.S. Attorney Deborah Daniels. "Anybody that has that much money and knows 
there is an investigation is a likely flight suspect." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels and her staff bided their time, waiting for officials in Washington to 
process hundreds of pages of documents at the Justice Department, translate 
them into German and move them through the State Department to Austria. 
</P>
<P>
The three were first arrested May 24 in Austria under the International 
Convention of Narcotics. There is no U.S.-Austria extradition agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"They had no indication they were going to be taken into custody," said Bernard 
L. Pylitt, an Indianapolis attorney representing Leary. "I have no idea what 
the Austrian government is going to do in this case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Near Salzburg 
</P>
<P>
Paul Heilbrunn, who shares a home near Salzburg with his wife and two children, 
"believes if he returns to the United States he will not get a fair trial," 
said Linda Pence, his attorney here. "The attitude toward drugs is such that it 
clouds everyone's minds as to guilt and innocence." 
</P>
<P>
"We're very hopeful the Austrians will give them their release," Pence said. 
"Paul did not flee, he did not leave that country at all. He knew an 
extradition request was pending. He's not going to flee." 
</P>
<P>
Pylitt and Pence said they did not know if Richard had an attorney here. 
</P>
<P>
Leary and her sons might have been likely to flee in the eyes of federal 
authorities, but to all appearances they were unlikely criminals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Outstanding Citizen' 
</P>
<P>
Leary, 58, had been president of the Indianapolis League of Women Voters and 
the local chapter of the National Council of Jewish Women. She was "an 
outstanding community citizen," said Robert Davies, a family attorney who was 
acquitted in March of money-laundering and conspiracy in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"She did a lot of things for the community. She was in every organization," 
Davies said. "She was in leadership positions. She gave the (impression) of 
being a well-to-do, community-spirited person." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Heilbrunn, 35, was a "very charming, bright guy," Davies added. 
</P>
<P>
However, authorities say Paul led the ring in partnership with a man Thar 
identified as Jeffrey B. Collins, an escapee from a Florida prison. Richard was 
one of three lieutenants immediately under the two partners, Thar said. Leary 
helped manage money laundered by dummy companies in the Bahamas and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marijuana Stolen 
</P>
<P>
The indictment says the ring imported at least 140,000 pounds of marijuana in 
1985 alone, storing it on a farm in northern Indiana and near Ann Arbor, Mich. 
When robbers stole 6,000 pounds from the farm, eight employees were given voice 
stress tests. The loss ultimately was absorbed by the Heilbrunns, Collins and 
unindicted co-conspirators Richard I. Bernstein and Charles E. Stocksdale. 
</P>
<P>
The ring operated in Indiana, California, Connecticut, Washington, Alabama, 
Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Michigan and Virginia, according 
to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Leary faces 12 counts, including conspiracy to distribute marijuana, 
money-laundering and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering. Paul 
faces 26 counts, including conspiracy to import and distribute marijuana and 
running a continuing criminal enterprise. Richard, 38, faces nine counts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax-Related Counts 
</P>
<P>
However, they could not be prosecuted on 21 tax-related charges if they are 
extradited under provisions of the International Convention of Narcotics. Eight 
of Leary's counts are tax-related, as are 10 of Paul's and three of Richard's. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the waiting process," said Daniels, who nonetheless is happy with 
other results in the drawn-out case. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've been real successful. We've convicted everyone we've gotten our 
hands on. The people who've fled to Austria, there was nothing we could do to 
stop that, and we have every reason to believe they'll be extradited."

FUTURE BLEAK FOR MADAGASCAR'S LEMURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BAUMGAERTNER, Deutsche Presse-Agentur 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TANANARIVE, Madagascar 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first rays of sunlight pierce the swatches of mist above the leafy green 
roof of Madagascar's eastern rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
The cacophony of twittering birds mingles with a penetrating howling that 
appears to come from the lush treetops in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice, the 24-year-old son of the local gamekeeper, recognizes the odd call 
immediately. "Those are the indris, the largest woolly lemurs on the island," 
he explains. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a family of four indris answers a call from another group of the 
species about a mile and a half away. The indris, known by the natives as 
babakoto or amboanala, have the loudest call of the lemur family. 
</P>
<P>
"There are mating calls or hedging-off cries designed to show whose territory 
it is," said Maurice, who compared the lemur utterances to the jungle calls of 
Asiatic gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
The gray and black indri, with its long hind legs, short tail and doglike head, 
measures about 2 feet long and belongs to a family of prosimians found only on 
Madagascar and the neighboring Comoro Island to the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The future for the indris looks bleak. People here are gradually destroying the 
lemurs' natural habitat by chopping down the trees on whose leaves the 
creatures feed. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of a ban, the local population is chopping down the rain forest to 
provide grazing land for their herds of Zebu African cattle. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of Madagascar's 342,000 square miles given over to the rain 
forest has declined from 72,000 square miles (21%) in the last century to 
41,000 square miles or 12% now. 
</P>
<P>
As the branches vanish, so do many unique species that are only to be found on 
the island. Here 86% of flowering plants, 65% of birds and 99% of reptiles are 
native to the island. 
</P>
<P>
The forefathers of the indri probably drifted from mainland Africa to the 
world's fourth-largest island on natural craft made of driftwood more than 40 
million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The lemurs had the place largely to themselves, since only a few other mammals 
managed to make the journey. 
</P>
<P>
There are currently 30 types of woolly lemur on Madagascar. An estimated 12 
species are thought to have died out since human beings began settling the 
island 1,500 years ago, including two lemur species whose representatives 
weighed up to 200 pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors are the dwarf lemurs such as the mausmaki, or the bizarre-looking 
aye-aye, which uses its bony middle finger to pry insect larvae from tree bark. 
</P>
<P>
The indri remains the most impressive of the lemurs. Its bushy ears, cut-off 
tail and howling cry have earned it an important place in Madagascan folklore. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice tells the story: A young man called Koto who climbed a tree in order to 
collect honey was attacked by a swarm of bees and could not get away. 
</P>
<P>
An indri came along and carried the youngster on his back to a safe forest 
clearing. Since then, the natives have dubbed the lemurs babakoto, or father of 
Koto. 
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Pierre Sonnerat chose the scientific name indri after discovering the 
creatures at the end of the 18th Century. He was the first European to set eyes 
on them but made the mistake of christening his find after the words used by a 
local guide, meaning simply, "There he is." 
</P>
<P>
Not a great deal is known about the indri, whose feeding habits have not been 
researched by zoologists. No zoo has succeeded in keeping an indri in 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Eight indris were taken to the Jardin de Plantes in Paris in 1939, but all of 
them died within a month, and not even the zoo here in the Madagascan capital 
has been able to keep an Indri alive and well behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
The indri's life style still puzzles animal behaviorists, who know for sure 
only that the female of the species assumes the leading role in the family 
groups of two to eight animals. Such female dominance is seldom found among 
primates.

TEEN SONS LEARN THE FAMILY BUSINESS -- ARMED ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SARASOTA, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a lot of couples, Matthew and Pamela Schultz taught their teen-age sons 
the family business. It wasn't your typical mom-and-pop operation -- the 
Schultzes were into robbery. 
</P>
<P>
For William, 16, and Matt, 15, the tools of the trade were AK-47s, police 
scanners, surveillance and survival gear, maps, wigs, even hypnosis, police 
say. They were trained in hand-to-hand combat, went through daily routines of 
jogging, sit-ups and push-ups, and memorized streets, zones and police codes. 
</P>
<P>
There were dry runs and days of scrupulously logging police movement. 
</P>
<P>
Files police found in a rented home near Sarasota included blueprint-like 
drawings and maps showing distances to police and fire stations, hospitals, 
malls, railroad terminals and streets leading to interstate highways. 
</P>
<P>
After a job, the two teens would be hypnotized and debriefed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eliminate Mistakes 
</P>
<P>
"Some sessions were more detailed than others," said Detective Bob Drone in 
Kenneth City, 50 miles north of Sarasota. "The reason was if any mistakes were 
made during a robbery they could be corrected before the next one." 
</P>
<P>
One mistake the Schultzes made cost them; they pleaded guilty in Tennessee to a 
botched robbery and drew a 10-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Documents police found in the house left no doubt that the Schultzes thought of 
it as a business. There were ledger entries for expenditures. A contract dealt 
with firearm purchases, handling of loot and standards of behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"No greed will be tolerated for personal use and pleasure," it warned, 
according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Police don't know much about the family. Schultz, 29, was at one time a 
trucker. His 35-year-old wife was a one-time exotic dancer and was married to a 
Rochester, N.Y., man named Hinton, who fathered the boys and since has died. 
</P>
<P>
The Schultzes told their landlady, Stella Penney, they were Matt and Pat Avery 
last September when they rented the three-bedroom country home she owned on 10 
acres near Sarasota. They said they would be there two years. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz told Penney he was a Marine on special assignment at MacDill Air Force 
Base in Tampa, 70 miles away. "I wasn't suspicious. I didn't know they were 
criminals," she said, adding that the boys were polite, but didn't seem to go 
to school and dressed mostly in military clothes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grew Wary 
</P>
<P>
Over the months, Penney grew wary of Pamela Schultz, who demanded several days' 
notice before the landlady could visit, then was rude to her. "I was getting 
kind of scared of her. The others would come around and apologize, make excuses 
for her that she was having a bad day or the like." 
</P>
<P>
The first police knew of the Schultzes was a six-month spree of robberies and 
burglaries that began in the Sarasota area in May, 1988. On Nov. 26, the 
Schultzes sat outside a Kenneth City restaurant while the two teens and a 
runaway they had picked up took $3,000-$4,000 at gunpoint, Drone said. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 1, Penney got the November rent. "Matt opened his wallet and I saw a 
stack of big bills, 2 inches thick. It was loaded; there were hundreds. I said: 
'What did you do, rob a bank?' " 
</P>
<P>
Schultz said no, then told her he was going to Tampa on business and would be 
back in a few weeks. But the family fled. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like they got out in a hurry," Penney said. They left behind two big 
dogs, their clothes and a $300 electric bill. 
</P>
<P>
Gone were the stove, dining room table and fans, and the carpet was ruined. One 
bedroom was painted in military camouflage colors. A barrel on the wooded lot 
had been used for target practice and looked like swiss cheese. Shots had been 
fired into the barn. Empty ammunition shells were scattered around and there 
were three homemade obstacle courses in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Headed Home 
</P>
<P>
Scared by a local crime-reenactment TV show, the Schultzes headed home to 
Churchville, N.Y., starting back south in January or February, police say. 
</P>
<P>
They made it as far as Red Bank, Tenn., outside Chattanooga, where police 
nabbed the two Schultz boys and a runaway from New York after the botched armed 
robbery of a businessman as he made a night deposit, said Sgt. Dan Dyer. 
</P>
<P>
Police recovered all but $110 of the $1,180 cash and $300 in checks. Some was 
stashed in a motel light fixture and $300 was in a refrigerator drip tray, he 
said. "The light globe had been lined with tissue paper so the money was not 
visible even when you shined a flashlight on it. Some of the stuff was 
ingenious." 
</P>
<P>
Police confiscated an AK-47 and 750 rounds of ammunition, a .45-caliber pistol 
with 130 rounds, an automatic rifle with 300 rounds, magazine clips and a 
number of military-type knives, Dyer said. "They had enough weapons and ammo to 
keep us held off the better part of a week." 
</P>
<P>
The Schultzes pleaded guilty last month to the robbery. A judge sentenced the 
adults to 10 years to run concurrently with any sentence in Florida. The boys' 
unspecified sentence is to be parallel and concurrent to Florida's. 
</P>
<P>
The family was extradited last month and pleaded innocent July 7 to charges 
stemming from three shoe-store robberies, one each at a computer software store 
and a yogurt shop and burglaries of a restaurant and three schools. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew and Pamela Schultz and William Hinton, now 17, face 24 counts each of 
conspiracy, robbery with a firearm, burglary and grand theft. Each is being 
held on nearly $500,000 bond. Matt Hinton was indicted by a grand jury on 19 
counts as an adult and is being held on $200,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
They are to be tried Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traced to Home 
</P>
<P>
Police traced the family to the rented home and found shotguns, ammunition and 
60 pounds of spent shells. They also seized a 3-inch-thick file giving more 
than a glimpse into the carefully orchestrated, resourceful operation that 
included runaways the adults brought into the fold. 
</P>
<P>
The contract they found reads in part: 
</P>
<P>
"Any and all firearms will be bought by the business and held by the overseer 
for proper use." Stolen money would be "cleaned and unmarked by overseer Matt." 
Big expenditures "would not be allowed in one lump sum as it might be traced 
back." Anyone who took drugs or alcohol within seven days of a job would be 
excluded. Traceable items had to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
There also were individual's notes: "three days ago, stopped smoking . . . you 
can beat anybody but Matthew . . . you are smart, smarter than the cops . . . 
you feel no pain . . . won't remember being hypnotized." 
</P>
<P>
Jobs were carefully planned. For a grocery store stickup, they figured 20 
seconds to open the safe, 15 seconds to grab the money, 10 to get out followed 
by a 100-yard dash. Police were two-fifths of a mile away. They had 36 seconds 
to run half the driveway with maybe 12 stacks of money totaling 20 to 30 
pounds.

CAN A TOWN BE TOO TRENDY?; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA FE'S SUCCESS PROMPTS QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
SANTA FE, N. M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rap your knuckles on the shiny new image of Santa Fe and some say you'll hear a 
hollow echo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a marvelous, grand illusion. It's all in the looks of things," artist 
Jerome Milord said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Sam Pick disagrees. He says that not only does Santa Fe have a heart, it 
has a heart of gold. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in this state is jealous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pick's cheerleading aside, many who live and work in and near this small, 
historic city of mostly adobe architecture say the community has lost the 
spirit that made it special, especially in the last 15 years of rapid growth 
and rampant tourism. 
</P>
<P>
While visitors rave about the mountain setting, the Spanish and American Indian 
culture and sophisticated art community, residents complain of traffic 
congestion, an inflated cost of living and the proliferation of trendy 
restaurants, art galleries and shops that sell cow skulls and carvings of 
howling coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an overwhelming preoccupation with the glitz and the glimmer and the 
myth and the concept of Santa Fe as promoted in national magazines," Steve 
Flance, a developer and former chairman of a city planning committee, said. 
"It's good for tourism. It's good for things that are cute and stylized, but 
very few people participate in that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Boutique-ified' Downtown 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe's transition is symbolized for some by the "boutique-ification" of the 
Plaza, the nearly 400-year-old heart of this state capital of about 75,000 
people that, until recently, was also the retail center. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, the population was about 50,000. The shops on the Plaza then 
were two drugstores, two general department stores, a Woolworth's, a sleazy 
bar, two shoe stores, some law offices and a J.C. Penney's. 
</P>
<P>
Sears was a block away. Two junior high schools were within half a mile of the 
Plaza, and the high school teams still played football in a nearby field. 
</P>
<P>
The Woolworth's is still there. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at any town in New Mexico, it's all the same. What has evolved is 
shopping centers," Pick said. "The difference is, you look at downtown Roswell 
and it's dead. The Plaza is alive." 
</P>
<P>
Alive, yes, Milord agreed, but not for the locals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Streets, Sidewalks Jammed 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Fe, especially in the summer time, is just an awful place to be -- 
unless you're hustling the tourists," he said. "The traffic is insane. There's 
no place to park. We're just choking each other to death! It's not even a town 
you can walk in." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Chavez, director of the Palace of the Governors, the 17th-Century 
government headquarters that is now a historical museum, sides with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"Businesses abandoned downtown Albuquerque," he said. "We could have had that 
happen here if we didn't have the tourism hook." 
</P>
<P>
And, he added, plenty of local people hang out downtown, which is still home to 
state government offices and the courts. 
</P>
<P>
"I dare anyone who's been in this town for any time to walk the Plaza and not 
run into someone they know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said much of the traffic congestion is created by local people cruising 
the main streets. He said parking space is available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
"Change will happen whether or not there is tourism. It's much easier to be a 
core community when you're a town of 30,000," he said. "A lot of people who 
don't like how the town has changed talk about the good old days. Each 
generation tends to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1 million tourists come to Santa Fe annually, city officials say, 
bringing with them more than $300 million in trade and generating $13.5 million 
in revenues from sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is the second biggest industry in this city," Chavez said. "It allows 
me to have a neat job in a neat city. Without tourism, I wouldn't be here. Half 
our locals would have to move." 
</P>
<P>
"Visitors are the cleanest industry you could possibly have," Pick says. 
</P>
<P>
But Flance says the benefits from the explosion in tourism and the influx of 
many wealthy newcomers have not affected most Santa Feans. 
</P>
<P>
"The boom is in boutiques, high-end real estate, tourism. Everybody else is 
pretty well struggling along," he said. "A lot of people in the community feel 
they are not part of the action, and they're not. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rich, Poor Sectors 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a bifurcation of the community -- physically, socially, 
economically. We don't have real poor, but we have underemployed being 
supported by their extended families." 
</P>
<P>
Flance said those not profiting from tourism are being forced out by the high 
cost of living, especially the cost of housing. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of living in Santa Fe is 10% above the national average, and the 
average house price is $144,000, a 125% increase from 10 years ago. (The 
national averages were about $113,000 in 1988 and $56,000 in 1978.) 
</P>
<P>
The average annual income per person is $11,002, about the same as the national 
average; 10 years ago it was slightly under the national average.

A Finnish tourist standing on shore drowned when a huge block of glacial ice 
dropped into a lake and caused a wave that swept him into the frigid water, 
local news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old victim, who was not identified, was on land about 20 feet from 
the edge of a small, deep lake when the wave hit him on Wednesday, the 
Dagbladet newspaper reported on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A large group of tourists was watching when Svartisen, a glacier near the 
northern Norway town of Mo I Rana, dropped chunks of ice into the ocean, the 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
"The Finnish tourist was . . . about 35 meters (112 feet) from the glacier 
itself. He probably lost his balance when the mass of water hit him," acting 
sheriff Terje Storroe of Rana said. 
</P>
<P>
Sightseers fled the wave that crashed onto the shore and watched helplessly as 
the tourist was washed into the lake, Dagbladet said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been madness for anyone to have tried to swim out to him in that 
icy water," Storroe said.

An 80-year-old woman who allegedly beat her husband with a crutch during an 
argument over their will has been charged with his death, police say. 
</P>
<P>
Stavroula Plexidas was arrested Wednesday in Megalochori, a small farming 
village on this outskirts of this town in central Greece, and charged with the 
murder of her husband, Nikolaos, 78. 
</P>
<P>
Plexidas was arrested after her dying husband told police that she had beaten 
him with her wooden crutch as he lay in bed Tuesday night after an argument 
over their estate, a police spokesman said Thursday.

GLOBAL WARMING LIKELY TO PRODUCE NEW BOAT PEOPLE 
</P>

Entire nations may be destined to become boat people some day. 
</P>
<P>
That is, unless scientists and governments can counter the threat of "global 
warming" that results in rising seas that would ultimately submerge low-lying 
islands and coastal areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about loss of islands, we are talking about loss of 
nations," said Stjepan Keckes, a top U.N. scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Sea levels are generally expected to rise slowly. "But for some countries the 
writing is on the wall," the director of ocean and coastal affairs at the 
Nairobi-based U.N. Environment Program said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists fear that with "global warming," average temperatures will rise 
because of a build-up in the atmosphere of so-called greenhouse gases, which 
trap the sun's heat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Temperatures 
</P>
<P>
Industrial and other gases, such as motor car exhaust fumes and methane 
generated from rice farming and cattle ranching, are trapping so much heat that 
temperatures are expected to rise by several degrees in the next 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
This would promote thermal expansion of oceans and a melting of glaciers and 
polar icecaps, as a result of which sea levels could rise by up to four feet. 
</P>
<P>
What if the polar icecaps crack, sending huge sheets plunging into the sea? 
Then, said Keckes, seas could rise a yard in a year. "That would be 
catastrophic." 
</P>
<P>
Half the world's people live in coastal regions, and the poorest among them 
will be the most vulnerable to rising seas, U.N. agency said. 
</P>
<P>
A study commissioned by the agency and the government of the Netherlands 
identified 10 countries that it said were probably representative of the areas 
most vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
These are Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, the Maldives, Mozambique, Pakistan, 
Senegal, Surinam, Thailand and Gambia. 
</P>
<P>
In an already densely populated country like Bangladesh, Keckes said, a rise in 
sea level of 3 feet would now affect about 28 million of the country's 90 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time it happens, there are going to be not 28 but 50 million people 
(affected). Where are they going to go?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Effects 
</P>
<P>
It is not only countries directly threatened like Bangladesh, the Pacific 
island states and the Indian Ocean islands of Maldives that ought to be 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Their plight could result in streams of people seeking to settle in, say, 
Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
As immigrants they ran the risk of losing their nationhood and culture. "Or do 
you allocate them a part of New Zealand where they try to create an artificial 
colony, unviable, removed from their natural environment and traditional way of 
life? These are big questions," Keckes said. 
</P>
<P>
Port cities worldwide would need to build defenses against rising seas, among 
them Buenos Aires, Calcutta, Istanbul, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, Manila, 
New York, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency cites one estimate that protecting the East Coast of the United 
States alone against a 3-foot rise could cost more than $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Keckes worries less about European and other developed countries than Third 
World states, which lack the money and technology needed for defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Rising sea levels in the Nile Delta, for example, could flood one-fifth of 
Egypt's arable land, now used by 10 million of the country's 49 million people. 
</P>
<P>
"It (Egypt) is already an importer of food, with high population growth. What 
are they going to do?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Island States 
</P>
<P>
He is most concerned about island states and countries like Bangladesh where 
coastal communities have little room to retreat inland. 
</P>
<P>
Dutch-type dikes are no real answer to island states. "They'll have to keep 
raising them, and end up living at the bottom of a funnel." 
</P>
<P>
The real solution is to tackle the root causes of global warming, Keckes said. 
A real obstacle is the perception that the threat is a long-term one, and 
therefore that action could wait. 
</P>
<P>
He named the Maldives as one of the few countries that has grasped the dangers. 
"Their whole statehood is at stake."

FOR HOLLYWOOD, IT'S ALL IN THE FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
RON HOWARD'S "PARENTHOOD" REFLECTS THE MOVIES' LATEST DISCOVERY: KIDS AND 
FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was bound to happen sooner or later. When movie executives start networking 
at 3-year-olds' birthday parties, when a studio chief routinely turns down 
breakfast meetings to spend quality time with her baby, when the carrousel at 
the Santa Monica Pier becomes the place to be seen on Sunday mornings, it's 
only logical that Hollywood would turn its creative eye to child rearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Three Men and a Baby" and "Baby Boom" were just the beginning. Now 
father-of-four Ron Howard has directed a movie expressly tailored for '80s 
parents -- baby boomers who are as fixated with child rearing today as they 
were with peace and rock 'n' roll 20 years ago. "Parenthood," which opens 
Wednesday, stars Steve Martin as a guilt-ridden, hands-on dad who tirelessly 
shoulders the troubles of his hypersensitive 9-year-old. The Universal release 
was produced by Howard's own company, Imagine Films, which he co-founded three 
years ago with partner Brain Grazer. 
</P>
<P>
For Howard, "Parenthood" marks a departure from his repertoire of fantasy films 
-- "Splash," "Cocoon" and "Willow." But the seeds of the story are very much 
his own, inspired by the turns his life has taken as the result of raising an 
8-year-old daughter, Bryce; a pair of 4-year-old twins, Jocelyn and Paige; and 
a 2-year-old son, Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Parenthood -- the real thing, not the movie -- "has changed my life more than 
any other event," says the 35-year-old Howard. "It is completely different and 
it will be forever." Spoken like a modern dad. 
</P>
<P>
Martin is not the only actor portraying a distinctly '80s brand of parenting in 
the film. Rick Moranis is a nightmare version of the yuppie parent who teaches 
his 3-year-old karate and Kafka. The divorcee played by Dianne Wiest was at 
Woodstock; now, two decades later, she can't control her two problem teens. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Robards is the family patriarch -- a less than ideal role model for 
modern dads -- who now has his hands full coping with his 27-year-old gambler 
son, played by Tom Hulce. Also appearing in the ensemble cast are Mary 
Steenburgen, Harley Kozak, Martha Plimpton, Keanu Reeves, Leaf Phoenix and 
Eileen Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
While "Parenthood" stands virtually alone in its exploration of contrasting 
styles of modern parenting, Hollywood is producing a plethora of films about 
parent-child relationships. Among those in the works: "Step Kids," a New Line 
film about a teen-ager coping with her myriad of step relatives; "Dad," a 
Universal release from TV's "Family Ties" creator Gary David Goldberg about a 
man who must take care of his aging father; "Stella" a Disney remake of the 
popular 1937 film, "Stella Dallas," about a mother-daughter relationship; and 
"Parenting," in development at Disney, about a divorced woman who brings a new 
man into her son's life. There is also at least one film about the traumas of 
baby-boomer couples unable to bear children -- Columbia's "Immediate Family," 
scheduled for release later this year. 
</P>
<P>
While TV currently has a monopoly on entertainment about parent-child 
relationships, movie history is not without its own examples. The Andy Hardy 
series gave moviegoers a warm and comedic look at relationships within a 
small-town American family. In the 1950s, teen-agers rebelled against their 
parents -- and other authority figures -- in "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The 
Young Stranger." Two decades later, "Ordinary People" provided a chillingly 
frank look at a family coping with the crisis of a lost child. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, as baby-boomer couples who postponed marriage and children start 
families, there is a surge of interest in movie projects about parent-child 
relationships. "I think people in America are really looking for stability 
now," says independent TV/film producer Bernie Brillstein. 
</P>
<P>
But Hollywood's sudden interest in family matters is just as much a product of 
its own changing social scene. When film makers go in search of ideas, they 
often look around at themselves and their friends. As the 1980s come to a 
close, more and more of them are seeing each other become new parents, vocally 
grappling with child-rearing problems that their own parents probably took for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
"Babies are in -- drugs and partying are out," says Martin Bauer, co-founder of 
the talent agency Bauer Benedek and father of two youngsters. "At these chic 
Malibu parties this summer, everyone's talking about schools. " 
</P>
<P>
That translates into more creative interest in parenting, Bauer notes, because 
increasingly the top decision-makers in Hollywood are between the ages of 35 
and 45. Most of these ambitious executives, agents and producers postponed 
families while they vigorously pursued their careers -- and the demanding 
social schedules that went along. Now these same Hollywood powers -- people 
like Columbia Pictures president Dawn Steel and Disney studio chief Jeffrey 
Katzenberg -- are showing up to parties with young children in tow. And no one 
objects when Steel turns down breakfast meetings, candidly stating that she 
spends those hours with her baby. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen years ago being hip was being young and single," says Imagine's 
Grazer, who also served as producer on "Parenthood." "Now being hip is being a 
responsible dad, a responsible parent. It's hip to have substance. People now 
have parties during the day so you can bring your kids." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all changed," adds talent agent Jim Berkus of Leading Artists Agency. 
"People are staying at home, entertaining at home more than they used to." 
They're also mixing business with family. When Berkus recently threw a birthday 
party for his 3-year-old, the magician stood in the front yard entertaining the 
kids, while some of their parents slipped to the back of the house to talk 
shop. "They didn't have to feel guilty about doing business because they were 
also spending time with their families," says Berkus. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood moms and dads -- like baby-boomer couples elsewhere -- approach child 
rearing with a different perspective than their parents. One of the biggest 
changes, of course, is the level of participation by fathers. 
</P>
<P>
"Parenthood" has the distinct ring of a film that grew out of long sessions of 
story swapping by a group of men who recently discovered fatherhood. In fact, 
it did, though the original idea for the film came from Howard. Doing the story 
swapping at Imagine's L.A. offices were Howard (who would fly in from his East 
Coast home), his script-writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel 
("Splash," "Nightshift") and Grazer. Between them, the four men have 15 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that the script is angled a little bit more toward the 
dad," says Ganz. "We questioned that, but we felt it was more honest to write 
from our point of view." That point of view is what gives "Parenthood" its 
distinctly modern flavor. More than parenting, this is a movie about 
baby-boomer men anxious to be good fathers. 
</P>
<P>
"Men have a different role and responsibility than they did in another time," 
says Ganz. "All of us felt that, as dads, we did not have the license, even if 
we were inclined, to say, 'I'm doing my part by bringing home the check.' " 
Howard agrees: "It wasn't long ago that dads could feel like they were doing a 
good job if they weren't abusive and brought home the bacon. That doesn't cut 
it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"Now being a good dad means going to Lamaze classes, happily cleaning up 
throw-up and changing diapers, and going to check out schools with the kids," 
says Grazer. Grazer, who has a 1-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son, is 
acutely attuned being an '80s dad -- he monitors his kids' diets, employs 
"sensitive guidance" over discipline, and takes his 3-year-old to breakfast 
alone four times a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to be a better dad than my dad," Grazer says. "That was a 
pledge." In the movie, Martin's character, Gil, makes that same pledge about 
his father (played by Robards). 
</P>
<P>
The film explores the anxieties and fears of fatherhood primarily through Gil 
and his inability to create a stable, happy world for his son Kevin (played by 
Jasen Fisher). All of the film's creators identified most closely with Gil's 
story. "You have all these expectations, you can't not have them," says Howard. 
"But they're difficult to live up to. . . . Gil has to face the fact that he's 
not going to protect his children from the outside world and who they are." 
</P>
<P>
Gil is constantly wracked by guilt that he isn't doing enough for Kevin. Howard 
may be a calmer father than this fictional creation, but he also confesses to 
pangs of guilt in his relationships to his children. "My greatest fault as a 
father is the coming and going in their lives," he says in a reference to the 
peripatetic life of being a film director. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron's not so much wracked by guilt as he is wracked by responsibility," says 
Grazer. "He's really driven by responsibility to everything -- to his work, his 
wife, to his sense of being a dad and the standard he's set up for it." 
</P>
<P>
That behind-the-camera image of Howard does not veer far from the one that was 
forever etched on the minds of millions of TV viewers during the 1960s and 
1970s. Howard, after all, played Andy Griffith's wholesome young son, growing 
up in the small town of Mayberry, N.C., for nearly a decade. In the 1970s, he 
was the innocent and impeccably responsible Richie Cunningham, a counterpoint 
to his more mischievous pal Potsie and the downright rowdy greaser they 
befriended, Fonzie. 
</P>
<P>
During the filming of "Parenthood" in Orlando, Howard and his wife, Cheryl, 
brought along their children, putting the twins in a local nursery school and 
sending 8-year-old Bryce to the tutoring sessions arranged for the children in 
the cast. The director agreed to a lunch-time interview on the set only after 
Bryce stood him up, deciding she preferred to eat with the other kids. 
</P>
<P>
Steenburgen brought her two children, ages 5 and 8, onto the set too. Between 
the children of the cast and crew, and the youngsters who had parts in the 
film, the set in Orlando looked like a suburban elementary school during 
recess. "If you don't like kids," said Steenburgen, "this is a bad set to be 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Martin doesn't have kids of his own, and he said that learning how to work with 
children was one of the toughest aspects of this role. "I haven't been around 
kids much," Martin says. "You don't realize how smart they are." In between 
filming Martin could generally be found entertaining the kids on the set with 
magic tricks he practiced during his early years working at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Moranis has children -- an infant and a 3-year-old -- though he promises that 
he's not the perfectionist, superachieving dad he portrays. To Howard, the 
Moranis character reflects "the way you feel about your first child carried to 
the extreme. You feel like you're molding clay." 
</P>
<P>
But Ganz notes that the completely unsympathetic Moranis character also is 
drawn from his own reaction to those obsessive yuppie parents who aren't 
satisfied unless their child plays Schubert and speaks three different 
languages by the second grade. 'It's these people who make you feel very bad as 
a parent for not giving your kids all these advantages, that make you feel like 
you're too lazy, not energized enough," Ganz says. "Rationally you can't take 
these people seriously, but deep down you have a fear that you may be screwing 
up."

ON THE DEFENSIVE OVER ASSAULT WEAPONS, THE GUN LOBBY IS USING CONTROVERSIAL 
TACTICS TO TARGET ITS ENEMIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

years, covers Congress, lobbying and other subjects.

<TEXT>
<P>
IN BLOOD-RED letters, the sign on the front window of the Dealers Outlet gun 
store in suburban Phoenix declared: "Urgent! Act Now! Stop the Gun Ban!" 
Inside, customers took time out from browsing through AK-47 assault rifles and 
a flock of other firearms to sign a petition -- and to vent their wrath at a 
local "turncoat," U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.). 
</P>
<P>
"We are petitioning to protest the semiautomatic gun-control bills before 
Congress," read the text above a fast-growing list of names. "If we allow the 
government to become involved in any type of gun control, we are violating a 
basic constitutional right, the right to keep and bear arms." 
</P>
<P>
The petitioners' target that sunny day last spring was DeConcini, a longtime 
opponent of gun-control measures who had suddenly switched sides, sponsoring 
one of the nine bills currently in Congress to ban the sale of assault weapons. 
"I'm a one-issue voter, and I'm going to do everything in my power to take 
DeConcini out," George Hiers, a burly man on crutches, vowed as he bought a 
semiautomatic shotgun for his wife to defend herself with while he's away on 
hunting trips. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on DeConcini was stirred up by the National Rifle Assn. in a display 
of fury that represented far more than retaliation against a former supporter. 
Long described as "the powerful gun lobby," the NRA is now scrambling to 
recover from stunning setbacks in the past three years. Over the NRA's 
opposition, Congress and state legislatures have enacted legislation banning 
"cop-killer bullets" that penetrate protective vests, plastic guns that can be 
slipped past metal detectors and "Saturday night specials" that are used in 
many crimes. And most recently, the group found itself caught in the furor over 
assault weapons that was ignited by the massacre of five children in a Stockton 
schoolyard last January. Those killings, combined with the increasing use of 
the weapons by drug dealers and youth gangs, have exacerbated the contentious 
relations between the NRA and its former allies. 
</P>
<P>
Law-enforcement leaders, concerned about rising violence and terrorism, have 
ended their friendliness toward the gun lobby and become well-organized in 
opposition. Politicians once fearful of the NRA have been much more willing to 
stand up to it; President Bush, an NRA "Life Member," on July 7 imposed a 
permanent ban on imports of assault rifles and has proposed limiting the 
semiautomatics' ammunition clips. The ban so infuriated some NRA members that 
they have launched petition drives in two dozen states to oust Bush from the 
organization. Meanwhile, California, whose voters only seven years ago defeated 
an initiative that would have frozen the number of handguns in the state, last 
May became the first state to ban assault weapons. At the same time, 
gun-control organizations are beginning to match the NRA's mass mailings, ads 
and lobbying; many schools are showing "Guns and the Constitution," an anti-gun 
video produced by Handgun Control Inc., whose chairwoman is Sarah Brady, wife 
of former White House Press Secretary James Brady, who was disabled by gunfire 
in the 1981 assassination attempt on then-President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
And the NRA even is feeling pressure from more-militant gun groups that 
threaten to drain away members and funds. Although enjoying a membership surge, 
the NRA ran up a record $5.9-million deficit last year after spending more than 
$83 million. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in fending off the assaults on assault weapons, the 118-year-old NRA is 
facing what its leaders call its most daunting challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a crossroads," James Jay Baker, the NRA's top congressional lobbyist, 
acknowledged as DeConcini's assault-weapons bill cleared its first Senate 
hurdle in April. "We're going to go down the road of either prohibitive 
firearms regulations or tough criminal justice provisions" -- that is, more 
prosecutors, penalties and prisons, the course sought by the NRA. "Once you get 
into a (gun-control) rut, it's tough to get out of that rut." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the nation's capital, two of the hottest battlegrounds in the 
assault-weapons fight are Arizona and Florida. That would seem ironic, since 
guns permeate the cultures of those generally conservative states. But with 
opinion polls in both states showing that large majorities of residents support 
bans -- and with police complaining about being outgunned by criminals -- 
legislators have moved into action, spurring angry counterattacks from the NRA. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
AS PAT JONAS signed the petition in the gun store near Phoenix, one could 
witness the NRA's true political power: mobilizing citizens at the grass roots. 
"I don't want to see guns outlawed," Jonas said, "because I like to collect 
guns." Probably no other organization in the world floods government officials 
with as many phone calls, letters, telegrams and visits from its members as the 
NRA. Charles J. Orasin, president of 15-year-old Handgun Control -- the NRA's 
chief nemesis -- estimates that as many as 500,000 members of the NRA and other 
gun groups regularly lobby elected officials and bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
The outpouring is prompted by red-alert mailings churned out by NRA leaders, 
all sounding essentially the same alarm: They're out to get your guns. These 
letters go not only to the NRA's 2.9 million members, whose $25 annual 
membership fee brings such benefits as a magazine, gun-theft insurance and 
safety instruction, but also to 10,000 affiliated hunting organizations and 
shooting-competition groups. 
</P>
<P>
Time and again, the NRA has proved that citizen action generated by such 
mailings can have far more effect on legislation than opinion polls, especially 
when a majority for gun control is relatively silent. "If a lawmaker is looking 
for an excuse to vote with the NRA, all he has to say is, 'I got a hundred 
calls from the NRA, but none from the other side,' " said a congressional aide. 
And in a close election, a well-organized, single-interest group such as the 
NRA can wield decisive power by turning out highly motivated voters. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of these red-alert warnings, written by NRA lobbyist Baker, that had 
been delivered to 100,000 gun owners in Arizona and riled up the customers at 
the Dealers Outlet outside Phoenix. Baker's letter assailed DeConcini's bill, a 
scaled-down version of the one enacted by California in May. DeConcini's bill 
calls for a nationwide ban on sales of AK-47s and eight other semiautomatic 
rifles -- guns enjoying wide popularity because they have the menacing look and 
much of the firepower of fully automatic assault weapons used by the military 
and police. (Automatic guns fire 20 bullets or so per trigger pull; 
semiautomatics fire one bullet per trigger squeeze, but a fast index finger can 
get off as many as 20 shots in five seconds as ammunition is automatically 
reloaded from a clip. And many semiautomatics can easily be converted to 
automatic weapons.) 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Baker called DeConcini's proposal a "tragic mistake," charging 
that it could even block sales of traditional hunting rifles and lead to 
criminal charges against 30 million sportsmen who own semiautomatic guns. "Does 
anyone seriously believe (Senate Bill) 747 will stop drug smugglers . . . who 
bring cocaine by the planeload . . . from bringing in any guns they want and 
selling them on the profitable black market Senator DeConcini's bill will 
create?" Baker's letter asked. It concluded with a call to arms, warning that 
DeConcini "needs to know we will not allow our constitutional freedoms to be 
strangled by restrictions that have absolutely no effect on the criminals who 
are supposed to be the real target! . . . CALL NOW! WRITE TODAY!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Lies and Exaggerations" 
</P>
<P>
GUN OWNERS' rage spread quickly after the NRA letter hit Arizona the last week 
of April. In three weeks, DeConcini's office received 6,395 calls and letters 
against his bill and 68 for it, despite a poll indicating that more than 
two-thirds of the people in metropolitan Phoenix favor some kind of ban on 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to the four corners of Arizona, and people are shocked and dismayed" 
by DeConcini's bill, said Landis Aden, a motorcycle-riding computer technician 
who lobbies part time for the Arizona NRA. Aden believes that semiautomatic 
guns would come in handy if a Mexican revolution spilled over the border and 
Arizonans got caught in the cross fire. "You could defend your farm or your 
ranch fairly well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Mandall, a brash Scottsdale gun dealer who insisted that a reporter feel 
the thrill of firing Uzi and AK-47 machine guns at a range in his store 
basement, vowed during a conversation there to "work with the utmost severity 
to get DeConcini out of office." He said he had sold three years' stock of 
assault rifles in the two weeks after Bush issued a temporary import ban in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
"People are talking recall here," said Lee Echols, range master for the Phoenix 
Rod and Gun Club. "We stood behind DeConcini at the last election, and we feel 
he has completely betrayed us." Another member of the club, Bill Houston, 
telephoned DeConcini aide Matthew McCoy in his Washington office to protest. 
McCoy's end of the conversation went this way: 
</P>
<P>
"You're misinterpreting the legislation. . . . Recall election? I think that 
will hurt everybody and not help anybody. . . . You think that by attempting to 
burn your friends you can . . . If the alternative were something more strict 
than DeConcini's legislation, how would you feel then? Metzenbaum is going to 
come from somewhere out of left field." Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) is 
pushing a ban that is much broader than DeConcini's. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed in his Phoenix office as the firestorm was building, a serene 
DeConcini accused the NRA of "lies and exaggerations" about his bill; he 
strongly disputed the NRA's claim that a provision banning any gun "nearly 
identical" to the nine listed in the measure could be interpreted to cover 
virtually all semiautomatics. The recently re-elected senator said he was 
trying to head off more-drastic legislation from Metzenbaum and others, 
including California Democratic Reps. Howard L. Berman of Panorama City and 
Fortney H. (Pete) Stark of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
But DeConcini was also careful to take political cover behind two Republicans 
who are NRA "Life Members." He noted Bush's import ban and cited a salty 
declaration by Barry M. Goldwater, Arizona's venerable former senator, that 
semiautomatic guns "have no place in anybody's arsenal. If any S.O.B. can't hit 
a deer with one shot, then he ought to quit shooting." (Goldwater made the 
remark shortly after appearing in a full-page, "I'm the NRA" ad in Time 
magazine.) 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini, an NRA "Person of the Month" last year, said that NRA officials 
"flat told me, 'We can't negotiate' " on his bill because "they were burned so 
badly last year when they negotiated with (then-Atty. Gen. Edwin) Meese on 
banning plastic guns. They said their membership and revenues fell off. . . . 
Now they need to get members and money, and that's why they're doing this to 
me. . . . If I weren't a mature person, I'd say, 'Up yours. Now I'm going to be 
a gun-control advocate, and you're going to lose me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Later, he said at a Senate hearing on his bill: "By using these tactics, the 
NRA is succeeding only in alienating its friend closest to the fight." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foxes in the Henhouse 
</P>
<P>
AS THE NRA waged its war in the West, Marion P. Hammer, a 50-year-old 
grandmother with brown bangs, strode to the front of another heated 
battleground in Tallahassee, Fla., a packed meeting room in the state's House 
of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
A subcommittee was getting ready to vote on a bill that would ban a list of 
semiautomatic assault weapons, and Hammer had asked to speak against it. Only 4 
feet, 11 inches tall, she could barely be seen as she took the podium. Her gray 
slacks, blue ruffled blouse and blue suede jacket complemented her steel-blue 
eyes but belied her credentials: prize-winning marksman and hardball lobbyist 
for the Florida NRA. 
</P>
<P>
To her supporters, Hammer represents all that is strong about the NRA; to her 
detractors, much that is weak. 
</P>
<P>
Attacking the crux of the bill, Hammer told the subcommittee: "You cannot 
differentiate between semiautomatic firearms that look menacing and your 
routine sporting firearms because, functionally, they are the same." 
</P>
<P>
Next, she dealt acidly with one of the NRA's prickliest political problems: 
"There are some law-enforcement officers who are NRA members who are against 
us. I would suggest to you that it would not be the first time that the fox has 
been in the henhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, as NRA Washington lobbyist Baker had done in his letter to Arizona gun 
owners, Hammer charged that a loosely worded definition in the Florida bill 
would inadvertently ban all semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. That is, the ban 
would cover not just the targeted guns -- the ones with folding stocks that 
make them easy to conceal, pistol grips, huge ammunition clips and flash 
suppressors that, according to police, make it easy to spray bullets from the 
hip. But doomed as well, she claimed, would be firearms of traditional design 
long used by hunters and target shooters in one of the nation's gun-owningest 
states. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking away firearms from law-abiding citizens who have lawfully owned them 
for decades is not the solution" to violent crime, she declared. 
</P>
<P>
One might have expected the House subcommittee to reject the bill handily on 
that April day. After all, two years earlier, Hammer had led a phenomenal 
victory for the NRA in Florida, winning passage of measures that threw out all 
locally imposed gun restrictions. The action was so sweeping that many Sunshine 
Staters thought that they had been freed to carry guns openly, Wild West-style. 
The Legislature later closed that seeming loophole in the wake of widespread 
hoots about the "Gunshine State." But it left intact all other provisions, 
including one making it much easier in many areas to obtain a concealed-weapon 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer has skillfully built support for the changes in the gun laws over many 
years. Rising at 4 a.m. after less than four hours' sleep, chain-smoking 
filter-tip cigarettes, sipping diet sodas -- and aided only by one part-time 
staffer and a $125,000 yearly budget -- she tirelessly works Capitol corridors 
and grinds out newsletters aimed at firing up the NRA's 130,000 Florida members 
to contact their representatives. Once, she threw a party at a firing range for 
legislators, aides, spouses and children; hundreds feasted on shrimp and 
oysters, and many took shooting lessons from expert instructors. 
</P>
<P>
Testimonials to Hammer's lobbying efforts -- not to mention her marksmanship 
with muzzle-loading rifles -- cover the walls of her office. Among the plaques 
and pictures is a Winchester .30-30 carbine from the National Antique Arms 
Assn., recognizing her as the first woman to receive its "Roy Rogers Man of the 
Year Award." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her past successes, however, the House panel voted 5-1 to pass the 
assault-weapons bill along to the full Criminal Justice Committee. Hammer still 
would have several opportunities to halt the bill's progress. But the 
surprising setback symbolized the NRA's shifting fortunes, not only in Florida, 
but across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The NRA has been unreasonable with their positions for so long, it's catching 
up with them now," asserted Rep. Ronald A. Silver, a Miami Beach Democrat who 
chairs the criminal justice panel. One of the NRA's major problems, he said, is 
that a number of legislative allies have been angered by its strong-arm tactics 
when the group decided they went astray. 
</P>
<P>
Dramatic evidence of this cropped up the day before the House action, when Sen. 
John A. Grant Jr., a conservative Tampa Republican who heads a companion Senate 
committee, was being interviewed about prospects for an assault-weapons ban. As 
Hammer sat casually on a table nearby, waiting to request that an NRA videotape 
be shown to the panel, Grant remarked that "the gun lobby is very 
well-organized, and I give them credit for being able to rally the troops on 
very short notice." But asked if the NRA provides accurate information, he 
responded, with a backward glance at Hammer: "Well, sometimes they get a little 
bit overzealous. When they said I was part of the Gestapo last year, that was a 
little out of order." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer explained later that Grant was referring to a newsletter in which she 
had said that a bill in his committee "sets up a modern-day Gestapo movement" 
because it threatened to invalidate many concealed-weapon permits. "I wasn't 
calling members of that committee Gestapo," she maintained. Nevertheless, Grant 
was so enraged that he had an aide call NRA officials in Washington to demand 
her removal. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. George G. Kirkpatrick Jr. (D-Gainesville) protested in an interview 
that he had been savagely attacked by Hammer's group in his latest campaign 
despite a "strong pro-gun" voting record. "They wrote the most vicious 
letters," he said. "They called me Judas" because he had backed a Senate 
leadership team viewed by the NRA as sympathetic to controls on handguns and 
assault weapons. Kirkpatrick, who easily won re-election, predicted that such 
tactics will backfire. "Because of the NRA's unwillingness to sit down and work 
out a reasonable solution to problems perceived by the public, it makes it much 
more difficult to get their mission accomplished," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hammer: "He's very bitter, but I have a job to do. We have a right to 
vigorously oppose anyone whose actions are detrimental to our best interests." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer faces another growing problem: competition from lobbyists on the other 
side. For instance, the day of the House subcommittee vote on assault weapons, 
she was outmaneuvered by Bernard Horn, the state legislative director for 
Handgun Control, who had flown in from Washington. Horn gave legislators a 
booklet picturing both the 27 guns proposed for banning and other semiautomatic 
rifles that were not on the list but that are popular with hunters. The move 
was aimed at shattering the NRA's claim that only cosmetic differences exist 
between assault weapons and sporting guns. 
</P>
<P>
The effect on subcommittee member Carol Hanson (R-Boca Raton) was decisive. 
Because of the booklet, she said, she was no longer willing to support merely a 
limit on the capacity of ammunition clips -- a fallback position to which 
Hammer had reluctantly acceded. Now, Hanson said, she favored banning the guns 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Hammer was able to minimize her losses. Instead of banning assault 
weapons, the Legislature in June created a commission to study them. And, 
instead of enacting a seven-day waiting period for gun buyers, as sought by 
Handgun Control, it required dealers to make a less-comprehensive background 
check by telephoning a police computer. Voters will decide next year whether to 
accept a three-day waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
Although a Handgun Control news release declared, "Florida Deals NRA Fourth 
Loss of Year," Hammer was able to say with some justification, "I think we did 
pretty good." The tide turned her way, she claimed, after legislators saw how 
student demonstrators in China were overwhelmed by troops "because they were 
unarmed." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after adjourning, the Legislature was called back into special session 
to reconsider a bill that would make it illegal for gun owners to carelessly 
leave weapons around children. The NRA had helped kill the measure weeks 
earlier. But after a spate of gun accidents killed three children and wounded 
three others in early June, Hammer gave conditional support to the bill, and it 
passed overwhelmingly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rambo Sells 
</P>
<P>
ON A BREEZY DAY last spring, a riot of orange- and gold-striped tulips swayed 
outside the gunmetal gray NRA headquarters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the eight-story building, many of the 365 employees worked on gun-safety 
courses, shooting competitions, police firearms training and other services 
that predominated at the NRA until heavy lobbying against gun control began in 
the 1970s. The shift came after the murders of two Kennedys and a King inspired 
passage of major federal gun regulations in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
In his seventh-floor office, Jim Baker -- one of five in-house lobbyists 
supplemented by four high-powered outsiders -- had put the finishing touches on 
his letter to Arizona gun owners, slamming DeConcini's bill. "I want this 
carefully fly-specked" for mistakes, he told a secretary as he left for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Over a roast beef sandwich and beer at a plush hotel restaurant, the handsome, 
35-year-old former prosecutor was asked whether Barry Goldwater's assertion 
that hunters don't need assault weapons had undermined the NRA's effort to 
prevent the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need any particular gun. You don't need to hunt. But I don't think 
you should have to justify anything in terms of need. That's a socialist 
concept. You ought to be able to own within reasonable limits what you want. 
The question is whether these proposals will fight crime effectively, and we 
think highly restrictive gun controls are a bankrupt concept." 
</P>
<P>
Baker argued that claims of assault-weapon violence are grossly exaggerated and 
that the Stockton massacre could have been carried out with almost any gun, not 
just the semiautomatic AK-47 wielded by Patrick Purdy. 
</P>
<P>
A bit more candidly, J. Warren Cassidy, the NRA's executive vice president, 
later acknowledged that the Goldwater comment had hurt badly. Cassidy said a 
number of concerned NRA members wrote him, asking, "What are you going to do 
about this?" He wrote back, asking, "What do you want me to do? I can't recall 
him, he's out of office -- he's an American legend." But Cassidy noted in the 
interview: "When a guy like Barry or Dennis DeConcini does these things, it's a 
belt to the solar plexus, because you've counted on these fellows." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Korologos, one of the NRA's well-connected outside lobbyists, recalled 
another example of the difficulty of fighting off assault-weapon bans. He said 
that while touring exhibition booths at the NRA's recent national convention, 
he came across "a basic .22 rifle that had a big banana clip and a big round 
thing to hold it with. It looked for all the world like Rambo's personal gun." 
Korologos asked the exhibitor, "Why are you ruining this perfectly legitimate 
rifle?" 
</P>
<P>
"Ah," came the response, "but they sell." 
</P>
<P>
Korologos commented: "Never mind it doesn't do us any good on Capitol Hill to 
have those damn things loose." 
</P>
<P>
An NRA operative conceded that, despite a tough "no-compromise" resolution 
unanimously adopted at the national convention, the NRA might have to back a 
compromise bill when Congress takes final action on assault weapons. "We may be 
branded as traitors, but that's the nature of the game in this town, to forge 
agreements and compromises," said the source, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, in the face of increasingly well-organized support for gun control, 
the NRA grudgingly compromised on cop-killer bullets in 1986 and plastic guns 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
To fight assault-weapon bills, Baker said, the NRA hopes to spend $5 million, 
most of it derived from direct-mail appeals. The organization's revenues last 
year included $45.4 million from membership dues and $9.4 million from 
contributions. About one-fourth of the $83.6 million in expenditures was spent 
on lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the NRA is continuing to contribute heavily to political 
campaigns, despite the disappointments it suffered in last year's elections. In 
1988, five incumbents and all 15 challengers supported by the NRA were 
defeated; although 182 incumbents won, the NRA netted no gain with the $770,000 
it poured into campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
For the assault-weapons fight, the NRA has sent dozens of police officers to 
Washington to offset pro-ban lobbying by police chiefs, launched a national 
newspaper and TV ad campaign and continued to make available to gun owners a 
900 toll phone number that has already produced thousands of NRA form letters 
to President Bush and members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Baker denied that NRA officials had anything to do with the petition drive to 
purge Bush from membership, saying that it originated with rank-and-filers 
"obviously disappointed with the President's first six months in office." But 
he added that the NRA board of directors would be forced to consider the matter 
at its September meeting. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, the NRA harshly retaliated against police chiefs who spoke out for 
gun control, seeking to get chiefs fired in Nashville, Tenn., and Baltimore 
County, Md. But Dover, N.H., Chief Charles Reynolds, president of the 
International Assn. of Chiefs of Police, said that he and NRA President Joe 
Foss recently agreed to "keep the debate issue-oriented, without personal 
attacks." 
</P>
<P>
The most frequent charge against the NRA is the one leveled by DeConcini -- 
that it lies and exaggerates. Denying this, Baker said "a survey of Congress" 
by the American Library Assn. had found that the library group and the NRA 
"supplied the most accurate information" of all lobbying organizations. In 
truth, the compliment appeared in a Library Journal gossip column, citing only 
the opinion of "a highly placed library source in Washington, D.C." GraceAnne 
DeCandido, who wrote the item, said it was based on "dinner-table conversation" 
with a government bureaucrat. "To have the NRA use that in support of their 
policies is beyond ludicrous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Prayer for Arms 
</P>
<P>
AT THE NRA's national convention in April, more than 16,000 people roamed 
across 160,000 square feet of exhibits at St. Louis' convention center. They 
shouldered pea-green SIG assault rifles. They clicked the triggers of 
super-light Glock 17 pistols. They marveled at new laser targeting devices that 
can project a red beam hundreds of feet, from gun to bull's-eye. 
</P>
<P>
And then, during a break, 1,000 NRA activists filed into a cavernous hall where 
Merrill L. (Pete) Petoskey, a wildlife biologist from Lewiston, Mich., 
delivered the opening prayer at the NRA's 118th annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear God, Creator of all ... 
</P>
<P>
 "Please give us the direction to make (gun-control advocates) understand that 
the actions of criminals, who should be confined, should not be dramatized into 
legislation that will impose on the rights of millions of law-abiding citizens 
to own and bear arms for lawful pursuits of recreation and self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please help and guide the leaders of the National Rifle Association and of 
this nation to preserve and strengthen this freedom and this right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amen." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the meeting, NRA President Foss acknowledged that the beleaguered 
group could, indeed, use more help. He called on the nation's 70 million gun 
owners "to get off their duffs if they want to keep their guns." The news 
media, the grizzled hero of two wars said, "have a million reasons for us not 
to have guns. But look at what happened in Germany when ol' Hitler did a good 
job in disarming the nation. If people are armed, it keeps the bad actors off 
the scene." 
</P>
<P>
"With your help," chimed in Wayne R. LaPierre Jr., head of the NRA's lobbying, 
"we will protect your basic God-given right to defend yourself and to own 
firearms in this country." 
</P>
<P>
At the NRA's annual banquet that night, actor Charlton Heston evoked his famous 
movie image of Moses on the mountaintop as he provided the group with an 
inspirational boost. 
</P>
<P>
As the main speaker, Heston noted that he keeps beside his bed a .45-caliber 
service revolver that he brought back from World War II. "That's a 
semiautomatic weapon, and I do not plan to surrender it," he proclaimed, 
banging the lectern. Then, accepting an ornate flintlock rifle from the NRA for 
his years of support, Heston hoisted it above his head as if it were a stone 
tablet. Intoning the punch line of a defiant pro-gun slogan, he suggested that 
nobody was going to take this weapon from him unless it was pried "from my 
cold, dead hands!" 
</P>
<P>
The 1,200 diners leaped up, roaring. For an army of crusaders besieged, it was 
just the rousing send-off needed for the tough battles ahead.

WHY JONATHAN BOROFSKY BOWED OUT; 
</P>
<P>
'I NEEDED TO BE ALONE WITH MYSELF AND FIND OUT WHAT WAS LEFT OF MY ART.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago Jonathan Borofsky was one of the most visible artists in 
America. The subject of a huge retrospective that roamed from one museum to the 
next from 1984 to 1986, Borofsky staked out a spot in the history books with an 
enormously popular show that summed up his life's work as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
A brash, colorful carnival that the artist customized for each museum it 
visited, the show involved autobiographical revelations, Jungian archetypes, 
giant mechanized clowns and monsters, drawings, paintings, sound effects, and 
an actual basketball court in its incarnation at the Temporary Contemporary in 
Los Angeles. Everyone from children to the highbrow critical Establishment 
loved the show, and had Borofsky been of a mind to, he could have parlayed 
himself into a major mass media figure. But instead, he chose to simply 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole success thing is a trap -- you become trapped into maintaining it," 
says the artist during an interview at his Venice studio. "I still haven't 
gotten over the effects of having that huge retrospective and that's pretty 
much why I bowed out two years ago. I needed to be alone with myself and find 
out what was left of my art." 
</P>
<P>
An athletic, boyishly handsome man of 46, Borofsky looks far younger than his 
years -- partly because he dresses like a teen-age boy about to go outside and 
wash the car. Shorts, sandals and a T-shirt are the uniform that he's worn for 
years, and the ponytail he has sported for nearly two decades seems more a 
matter of comfort than hipness on him. A loner who maintains an amiable 
distance from the art world, Borofsky is defiantly oblivious to trends. "Is it 
Debbie Gibson this month or are we post-Debbie Gibson?" he asks at one point. 
He comes off like a man who is at once deeply concerned and connected with the 
world around him, yet detached and serene -- somehow removed from the fray. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I wanted to get my work out there and communicate things that were 
important to me," he continues in reflecting on his retrospective, "and I knew 
that was my big chance to do it, but taking that huge show around, giving 
lectures, meeting new people all the time -- it was sort of nightmarish. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was the leader of a rock band on tour and I never had any time 
to tinker in the studio, to make blunders and stupid little paintings that you 
don't show to anybody because they're just embarrassing experiments. When 
you're in the public eye, you can't be doing that stuff, so I finally realized 
it was time to wind down the machine. I hadn't had a show at my New York 
gallery in four years because I was busy with the retrospective, so last year I 
had a show there and that really felt like some kind of ending to me. Now I 
just say no to any offers that come up and people pretty much know not to 
bother asking by now." 
</P>
<P>
Borofsky realized that his exhibition last year at New York's Paula Cooper 
Gallery marked the conclusion of a major phase of his career, but what he 
didn't know was what to do next. Having had his moment as a superstar artist, 
he had no interest in repeating the experience. And, with roots in 
Conceptualism and Minimalism, he's never concerned himself with establishing a 
trademark look and churning out salable objects. Having cleared the decks of 
obligations, filed a ream of press clippings and unplugged the phone, his 
mandate was clear: It was time to hunker down and wait to see what emerged from 
the ether -- perhaps the hardest part of any creative pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been difficult to spend the past two years without any clear direction -- 
there's a tendency to worry that you're being lazy, when in fact, you're just 
doing a different kind of interior work on yourself," Borofsky said. "Some days 
the idea of deadlines and frenzied activity is very appealing, but I'm forcing 
myself to resist that because I want to find out what else might be in my head. 
There's something else I'm looking for now." 
</P>
<P>
Usually described as Expressionism with Surrealist underpinnings, Borofsky's 
work of the last 20 years has focused for the most part on the artist himself. 
Proceeding on the assumption that all human beings are fundamentally the same, 
he's explored his own personality in an attempt to discover larger truths about 
the human condition. Along the way he's blueprinted several stylistic 
signatures; painting directly on gallery and museum walls, a numbering system 
that assigns each piece he does an identifying number and drawings and 
paintings that explore his dreamlife. He's also developed a cast of characters 
that turn up repeatedly in his work: a hammering man, ballerina clown, 
chattering man, running man, molecule man and a man with a briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
While Borofsky continues to find many of these motifs potent and viable, he's 
in the process of retooling his visual vocabulary, and many longtime fans found 
his uncharacteristically subdued show last year at the Paula Cooper Gallery 
distressingly lacking in his trademark look. (For that show Borofsky lined the 
gallery walls with flags from around the world; at the center of the room was a 
lifesize figure of a man with a red, pulsating heart.) 
</P>
<P>
"The flag show was a step away from everything I'd done up to that point," says 
the artist, who has no L.A. gallery affiliation despite the fact that he's 
lived here since 1977. "It was time for a change and this felt real good to do, 
real clean and pure. The flag show was subtle, though, and it was received much 
more quietly than my noisy shows, which tend to elicit a noisy response. It's 
hard to sell a new idea once you're established and I was told that some people 
who were used to the Borofsky look didn't know what to make of the show. But 
really, I'm not sure what the Borofsky look is -- there are at least five 
different styles I use repeatedly." 
</P>
<P>
Borofsky's numbering system continues to provide a sense of order in a life 
that is otherwise lived by intuition. As he explains, "the counting system is 
what allows me to let go on every other level." His dreams, however, aren't 
quite as compelling for him as they once were. 
</P>
<P>
"I was intensely focused on my dreams from 1971-77," he says, "but these days 
-- and I don't know if this has to do with age or what -- my dreams aren't as 
frequent or as intense. I still write them down, but I'm not painting them too 
much anymore," 
</P>
<P>
Though his dreams are of less importance to him, Borofsky's cast of sculptural 
figures looks to be with us for a while. Fabricators in Connecticut are 
presently at work on a 44-foot "Hammering Man" to be installed in front of a 
bank in Bassel. "I like things big because there's an excitement to bigness in 
anything -- it's fun," he says of the massive scale he frequently employs. The 
Bassel installation will be completed with an 8-foot, spinning synthetic red 
ruby that will be suspended in the atrium of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
On the local front, one of Borofsky's most popular creations, his "Ballerina 
Clown" is to be prominently installed above the entrance to the North Beach 
Cafe, a restaurant under construction at the corner of Main and Rose in Venice. 
It's scheduled for unveiling in October. 
</P>
<P>
"We're both compromising," says the artist with a laugh. "I have to have my 
sculpture over a restaurant and they have to have my sculpture over their 
restaurant. I've never had a piece -- particularly such a 'difficult' piece -- 
installed as publicly as this and I'm quite excited about it. It's an extreme 
piece in an extreme location, and I haven't even suggested yet that the 
installation include the soundtrack playing 'My Way,' which was an important 
part of the piece as originally conceived." 
</P>
<P>
Discussion of old business concluded, the conversation resumes a week later at 
the house in Tuna Canyon that Borofsky shares with his wife of 18 months, six 
cats, and a three-legged raccoon. "It's very quiet up here so it's a good place 
to hear the chatter of the mind," he says of the spacious dwelling that seems 
to consist almost entirely of windows. "I've never lived in an environment like 
this before and spending a lot of time here is helping me learn some things 
right now." The house's simple furnishings include a grand piano, a synthesizer 
and assorted musical instruments -- unbeknownst to many people who admire his 
art, Borofsky is equally involved with music. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been developing music for several years, but it's recently taken a 
quantum leap forward because I have more time to devote to it," he says. "But 
music won't necessarily be the focus of where I'm going with my work." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the thing Borofsky is currently most excited about is a 55-minute video 
he completed in 1986 with artist Gary Glassman (related video works by Glassmam 
are currently the subject of an exhibition at Los Angeles Contemporary 
Exhibitions, downtown). Titled "Prisoners," the tape is composed of interviews 
with 32 inmates in California prisons, and offers a good idea of the direction 
Borofsky may take next. 
</P>
<P>
"My work seems to be evolving in an increasingly humanistic direction," he 
said. "There's always been an element of that in what I've done, but it seems 
to be getting stronger -- the prisoners tape being the most obvious example of 
actually giving up a year of my life to go out and talk to people about their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned quite a bit from the experience -- one of the things that emerged 
was that 28 of the 32 inmates we interviewed had histories of child abuse. 
There's some valuable information on the tape and we've tried to get it aired 
on television several times, but it's always rejected for one reason or 
another. Part of the tape deals with corporate crime, for instance, so there go 
the sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
"The tape is a breakthrough for me because it deals with the human spirit 
directly and I'm finding it a great vehicle for talking about life and the 
human condition." 
</P>
<P>
A child of the '60s who studied yoga, mysticism and meditation, Borofsky has 
adopted the phrases Art is for the spirit and All is One as the unofficial 
slogans of his career (those words have been incorporated in countless pieces), 
and the spirit of altruism at the heart of "Prisoners" has always been central 
to his work. Unfortunately, socially concerned art of this sort is currently in 
rather short supply, as the art world grows increasingly chummy with the 
business world. Not surprisingly, Borofsky is less than pleased with the 
current state of affairs in the art world. 
</P>
<P>
"The commodification of art? Well, there is a problem there," he says. "I don't 
understand this current mania for art. Apparently our culture needs to feel 
that it has these objects of absolute value, but the whole thing depresses me. 
It's a pretty materialistic world, more now than ever. A Hockney painting makes 
the front page of the L.A. Times but is any part of the article devoted to what 
that painting meant to Hockney or what the symbols in the painting represent? 
No, the only thing discussed is the amounts of money exchanged. Artists, of 
course, rarely object to this sort of development because they don't want to 
bite the hand that feeds them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that I'm Mr. Purity and the art world sucks," he continues, 
"but I think art -- and life -- should be on a higher plane than dollars and 
cents. Artists are paid very well for what they do, but money has never been 
the reason why people made art. Art is a fragile, highly personal thing, and as 
far as I'm concerned it would be embarrassing to have a painting wind up at 
auction with people throwing money at it. Auctions are for slaves. It's an ugly 
thing to me and I would never willingly participate in a live auction of my 
work. Artists get excited when their work goes to auction thinking it will 
drive up their prices, but what it really means is that the people who bought 
the piece don't give a hoot about it and are trying to make some money on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I sound like a hippie and at the moment it's popular to write off this kind of 
thinking as naive," he sadly concludes. "I don't want to come off like some 
leftover from the '60s, but I really am very much struck by how money-conscious 
the world has become. Many people tend to be skeptical about taking a spiritual 
approach to life because the only thing that's paid off for a lot of people is 
reality -- you know, you make some money then purchase something in a box and 
you take it home and it does something for you. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many things going on that are unseen and unacknowledged. 
Sometimes I sit up here in the mountains and just beam out the most positive 
energy I can. Not to my wife, or my mother and father, or anyone I know, just 
to the universe. It might be doing nothing, but it might be doing a lot -- and 
it certainly does something for me. If you send it out, it comes back. For me, 
that's the wavelength art should be operating on and that's why I had to slow 
things down in my career. I needed time to get on that wavelength."

BEER COMPANIES' ROCK SPONSORSHIPS STIR CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the Who performs an all-star production of its rock opera "Tommy" on Aug. 
24 at the Universal Amphitheatre, it will be a battle of the brands -- beer, 
that is. 
</P>
<P>
Michelob has a sponsorship deal with the Amphitheatre. Miller Genuine Draft is 
bankrolling the Who's stadium tour. Budweiser is sponsoring the production of 
"Tommy." 
</P>
<P>
The disturbing irony in this sea of suds: A founding member of the English 
band, drummer Keith Moon, died in 1978 of alcohol-related causes, and another 
member, Pete Townshend, has acknowledged an alcohol addiction. 
</P>
<P>
The "Tommy" example reveals the extent to which beer companies have become 
involved in the financial workings of the pop/rock concert industry. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 75% of the nation's key concert facilities -- including the Greek 
Theatre and the Pacific Amphitheatre -- have beer company sponsors, who pay 
fees ranging from $100,000 to $500,000 a year for the privilege of plastering 
their name around the venue and on the concert tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The beer companies are happy to spend the money because it gets their message 
to an audience of young, active, affluent consumers. From the vantage point of 
the concert industry, the subsidies help protect their profit margins and help 
hold down ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
But critics contend that the sponsorships promote alcohol consumption to large 
numbers of concert-goers under the age of 21, which is the legal drinking age 
in 33 states. They fear that the tie-ins may encourage impressionable, 
music-loving young fans to start drinking or to drink too much. 
</P>
<P>
Beer company sponsorship of pop and rock concerts is big business -- and 
getting bigger. The beer industry spends an estimated $50 million annually to 
subsidize concert venues and performers' tours. That doesn't count the amount 
spent placing ads on TV and radio in which many of the same pop and rock stars 
sing the praises of their favorite brew. 
</P>
<P>
The $50 million outlay for music sponsorships is a drop in the bucket compared 
to the $756 million the beer industry spent last year on all forms of media 
advertising, but it's significantly higher than the amount the industry spent 
in several individual advertising outlets, including consumer magazines ($18 
million), newspapers ($19 million), outdoor billboard advertising ($22 million) 
and cable TV spots ($34 million). 
</P>
<P>
The business of beer and rock came to public attention when U.S. Surgeon 
General C. Everett Koop attacked the practice at a Washington press conference 
on May 31. 
</P>
<P>
"I have received a lot of praise as surgeon general because of my strong stand 
on AIDS prevention," Koop said. "I was never afraid to say the 'C word' -- 
condom. I am also not afraid to say the 'A word' -- advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain advertising and marketing practices for alcoholic beverages clearly 
send the wrong messages about alcohol consumption to the wrong audiences." 
</P>
<P>
Koop, who is scheduled to leave office on Sept. 30 but has vowed to continue 
fighting for this cause as a private citizen, called the press conference to 
announce 10 recommendations for reducing alcohol-related traffic fatalities -- 
the No. 1 cause of death among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Koop noted that more than 40% of deaths among 15- to 20-year-olds result from 
motor vehicle crashes -- and that about half of these fatalities involve 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Koop singled out the practices of using celebrities who have 
strong appeal to youth, and sponsoring rock concerts and sports events. 
</P>
<P>
"These practices tell youth that alcohol consumption leads to athletic, social 
and sexual success," he said. "They send the message that drinking is a normal 
and glamorous activity without negative consequences. And our young people are 
believing these messages." 
</P>
<P>
Micky Saboff, national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, echoed 
Koop's concerns, though she stopped short of calling for a ban on alcohol 
sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of a whole package of influence, like the marketing of beer on 
college campuses and at beaches during spring break," said Saboff. "It's part 
of the whole issue of the content of alcohol advertising and the messages kids 
get. But we don't have a position to discourage sponsorship. We recognize that 
liquor companies have a right to sponsor these events, but they have no right 
to sell to people who are under age." 
</P>
<P>
Beer company spokesmen deny that their advertising practices -- including 
concert sponsorships -- encourage young people to drink. 
</P>
<P>
"Every study has concluded that advertising doesn't cause alcohol abuse and 
underage consumption of our product," said Stephen K. Lambright, a vice 
president at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, the nation's top brewery. 
"Advertising does what it's intended to do: influence a person to choose Brand 
A over Brand B. 
</P>
<P>
"We as a company are in no way trying to duck the issue of alcohol abuse, 
underage consumption or driving under the influence," Lambright added. "We only 
differ with the surgeon general on how you go about resolving the problem. We 
don't agree with his conclusion, and we're not going to change the way we do 
business simply because of this report." 
</P>
<P>
Until about 10 years ago, most pop and rock stars wouldn't have considered 
aligning themselves with a corporate sponsor. It would have been viewed as 
"selling out" to corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
Not that major companies were exactly besieging them with offers. Most 
companies were -- and many still are -- leery of rock stars and rock music, 
fearing that it projects the wrong image. 
</P>
<P>
This started changing in 1977, when Rockbill Inc., a New York-based marketing 
company, persuaded Anheuser-Busch to sponsor a concert series in Cape Cod, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few years, the dam burst. In 1981, the Rolling Stones signed a 
$500,000 deal with Jovan cologne. In 1982, the Who signed a $1-million deal 
with Schlitz beer. In 1983, Michael Jackson signed a $5-million deal with 
Pepsi-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really an '80s phenomenon," said Gary Bongiovonni, editor of Pollstar, a 
weekly trade magazine that covers the concert industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gotten to the point now in terms of big tours that it's far more common 
to have a corporate sponsor than not to have one," he said. "A few acts, based 
on principle, won't associate with corporate sponsors, but probably 75% of big 
tours have them. I think everybody looks at it as extra money to put in their 
pocket to help defray the expenses and risks of going on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Rockbill president Jay Coleman notes that corporate sponsorships have become a 
major part of funding for pop concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"At a decent amphitheater, a sponsorship can mean anywhere from $250,000 to 
$500,000 a season," Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a very important part of the revenue stream for concert promoters 
today. A lot of them rely on the money they receive from corporate sponsorships 
to help ensure that they'll make a profit over the course of the season." 
</P>
<P>
John Marx, vice president in charge of the contemporary music department at the 
William Morris Agency, was even more emphatic: "Promoters and venues argue that 
without those revenues, they couldn't be in business." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Solters, a senior vice president at MCA Music Entertainment Group, which 
oversees Universal Amphitheatre operations, said that it's becoming harder and 
harder for venues to resist sponsors' advances. 
</P>
<P>
 "In today's economic climate, if somebody approaches you and says they'll give 
you a couple hundred thousand dollars to put up a sign and be in your 
advertising, it's something you have to consider," Solters said." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to easing the bottom line for concert promoters, corporate 
sponsorships also help keep the cost of concert tickets down. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Kahane, who co-manages George Michael, estimates that ticket prices would 
go up by $2 to $2.50 per show without the sponsorship subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
While a wide range of companies are involved in sponsorships, breweries are 
especially active. 
</P>
<P>
"Every major brewery has endorsements," said Gary Smith, vice president at 
Pollstar. "And all the venues are trying to get endorsements whenever possible. 
It's more than just a trend. It's just simply good business." 
</P>
<P>
Demographics. 
</P>
<P>
That's the main reason that breweries have become involved in rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
The prime concert audience and the prime beer-drinking market overlap to a 
degree that is a marketer's dream. The core consumers in both cases: 18- to 
24-year-olds (though, of course, beer marketers insist that they target only 
people of legal drinking age). The secondary market in both cases: young-end 
baby boomers in the 25-to-34 range. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just the age of the fans at concerts that appeals to beer 
marketers. 
</P>
<P>
John Hellweg, vice president of marketing services for Stroh Brewing Co. in 
Detroit, nearly drooled when he profiled a typical concert-goer. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people who are active and outgoing, who have disposable incomes, who 
are cognizant of what's hot and what's not," he said. "They are people who will 
spend their money, who go out of their way to get out of their homes and 
apartments. They're exactly our target customers." 
</P>
<P>
Maile Buker, program manager of field marketing for the Coors Light Group in 
Golden, Colo., agreed that pop music is one of the best ways to reach a young, 
active audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is integral to young adults' life style," she said. "It's a big part of 
their life. We think it's a way to speak directly to our consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than sponsoring national tours by the biggest names, Coors sponsors 16 
local and regional bands who play rock clubs around the country. Buker said 
that one of the reasons is to transfer the intense loyalty that fans feel for a 
favorite band to the brand of beer served at the club. 
</P>
<P>
"Local bands are local heroes," she said. "They've got a captive audience that 
we wish to try and access ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
John Shafer, manager of consumer affairs for the Miller Brewing Co. in 
Milwaukee, said that Miller sponsors artists and venues popular with fans in 
the 21-to-35 age group, which is their target market. 
</P>
<P>
"People who are under 21 also enjoy some of the same kinds of music, but our 
sponsorship isn't intended to encourage them to buy our brand," he said. "I 
doubt that any of our concerts are put on where we expect a majority of the 
audience to be under 21." 
</P>
<P>
And what is it about rock that appeals most to beer marketers? 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the 21- to 35-year-olds who drink beer also enjoy rock music," Shafer 
explained. "If they enjoyed opera, we'd sponsor opera." 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that artists are becoming more conscious of the need for 
responsibility in this area -- or at least more aware of the repercussions of 
associating with alcohol products. 
</P>
<P>
"Musicians and athletes are taking a second look at whether they should promote 
alcohol," said Pollstar's Smith. "If it's going to give them a negative image, 
a lot of artists will stop doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Hall, vice president/publisher of Live Concert Network, which publishes 
handbills distributed at 50 venues nationwide, drew an analogy to tobacco 
endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be hard to imagine an artist these days aligning with a tobacco 
company," Hall said. "In talking to artists and managers who are seeking 
sponsorships, we don't even ask about tobacco sponsors, and now more and more 
they're telling us that beer is a no-no." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Ringo Starr announced that he won't endorse an alcohol product on 
his current tour -- and won't even allow any alcohol backstage. The ex-Beatle, 
who did commercials for a wine cooler a few years ago, has admitted to past 
alcohol problems. 
</P>
<P>
Starr's sponsor on his upcoming tour: Diet Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
George Michael is another pop star who won't accept an alcohol company 
sponsorship. His co-manager, Kahane, said that Michael turned down a 
sponsorship deal with Michelob on the grounds that many of his fans are 
underage. 
</P>
<P>
"George won't touch anything that has to do with alcohol or cigarettes because 
he has a tremendous amount of influence over kids and he doesn't want them to 
think that it's cool because he's endorsing it," Kahane said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael takes it a step further. When he is playing facilities that are 
alcohol-sponsored, he demands that all alcohol signs in the building be 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
Performers aren't the only ones trying to exercise more restraint. 
</P>
<P>
The beer companies say they are cautious about sponsoring any act known to have 
a large underage following. They don't even want to give the appearance of an 
association. 
</P>
<P>
On their "Licensed to Ill" tour in 1987, the Beastie Boys used a giant replica 
of a six-pack of Budweiser beer as a stage prop. Because the rap trio was then 
one of the hottest acts in pop, Anheuser-Busch briefly considered entering into 
a sponsorship deal with the group. But Ken Anderson, the trio's New York-based 
lawyer, said that the discussions came to an abrupt halt as soon as 
Anheuser-Busch executives saw the Beasties' show, which focused on their rowdy, 
chug-a-lug image and drew a large number of underage fans. 
</P>
<P>
Busch not only passed on the sponsorship, but filed suit to force the trio to 
stop using the Bud trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"Anheuser-Busch didn't think it was appropriate to be affiliated in any way 
shape or form with the act," company spokesman Gary Pagano said. "To have the 
prop on stage might leave the impression that there was a connection." 
</P>
<P>
But occasionally there is a slip-up. Anheuser-Busch included teen heroes New 
Edition in the lineup on its recent Budweiser SuperFest concert series. 
</P>
<P>
Pagano contended that the group's target audience is in its early to mid-20s, a 
characterization disputed by several people interviewed for this article. New 
Edition's manager, Craig Fruin, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lesa Ukman, editor of Special Events Report, a Chicago-based newsletter that 
reports on sponsorship, suggested that demographic studies by an outside 
company be required to ensure that at least 80% of a performer's core audience 
is above the legal drinking age. If it's not, she said, a beer company 
shouldn't be allowed to sponsor it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in the beer companies' interest more than anyone else's because the last 
thing they need is having public sentiment turn against them," said Ukman. 
"They saw how quickly things turned around in public tolerance for tobacco." 
</P>
<P>
Key figures in the entertainment industry are split on the beer/rock issue. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Weisner, whose management client Steve Winwood had a sponsorship deal last 
year with Michelob, said that he is against government attempts to control what 
an artist does. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you start doing that it's almost a type of censorship," he said. "Where 
do you stop? They could beat up the soft drink manufacturers because caffeine 
isn't good for you. I think it should be every artist's individual decision -- 
not the federal government dictating what you can and cannot do." 
</P>
<P>
But Danny Goldberg, who manages Belinda Carlisle, Sheena Easton and Bonnie 
Raitt, was supportive of Surgeon General Koop. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure whether or not I agree with him, but I think his ideas have to be 
taken very, very seriously," Goldberg said. "He comes from a medical point of 
view, not a religious agenda or a demagogic political agenda." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg's position is surprising because he is an American Civil Liberties 
Union activist and an outspoken critic of the Parents' Music Resource Center -- 
the Washington-based organization that advocates warning stickers on selected 
rock albums. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot more respect for Koop's concerns than I do for the PMRC or a long 
list of cheap, headline-seeking politicians who are trying to give advice to 
entertainers," he said. "I think it's time that people in Washington started 
identifying alcohol as the biggest drug problem this country has. That leads 
you into the true complexity of dealing with the drug problem as opposed to 
simplistic phrases like 'Just Say No.' " 
</P>
<P>
Many in the concert industry believe that a compromise can be worked out, in 
which concert facilities would be allowed to keep the beer sponsorships if they 
display messages urging young people to exercise moderation and responsibility 
in their drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing kids see when they walk into a venue should be signs saying, 
'Pick a designated driver' and 'If you drink, don't drive,' " said Johnny 
Podell, director of the East Coast contemporary music department at the William 
Morris Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"If they get that message from the time they start going to concerts, you 
haven't just neutralized the issue, you've turned it into a positive. It brings 
rock 'n' roll and safe drinking together, not where rock 'n' roll is cool and 
safe drinking is something your parents tell you to do." 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Koop expressed the hope that the alcohol companies 
will exercise more responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the nation's surgeon general, not the nation's chaplain," he said. 
"Nevertheless, I think we should all pray that those who are caught between 
their conscience and their pocketbooks on this issue make the right choice."

MOROCCO IS COLOR and spice. Mountains tinged lilac and sandalwood; deserts 
glowing pink and golden; peacock-blue seas. The scents of lemon blossoms and 
cedar fill the air, the pungent flavors of dried chiles, cumin, coriander and 
saffron linger on the tongue. 
</P>
<P>
Morocco also is the garden spot of North Africa, rich with agriculture, from 
the artichoke and zucchini fields of the Sebou Valley to the vast orange groves 
of Agadir. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an incredible variety of produce all year round," says Moroccan-born 
Michel Ohayan, proprietor of the Koutoubia Moroccan restaurant in West Los 
Angeles. "Not just peppers and tomatoes like in some parts of the 
Mediterranean, but turnips, carrots, squash, tiny green beans, white and green 
asparagus, green peas, artichokes, kidney beans, even our own white truffles." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, in Morocco, vegetables are cooked with meat. Ohayan cites a 
favorite dish of meatballs braised with celery. And, he adds, the famous 
Moroccan stews called tajines aren't made only with lamb or chicken. One is 
based on cardoons, another on fennel, a third on Jerusalem artichokes. A 
particularly elaborate version uses lamb simply as flavoring for a stew made of 
okra and quince. 
</P>
<P>
But Moroccans serve their vegetables in another way, too -- as salads. Moroccan 
salads aren't big jumbles of greens with a few extras added like ours. As Paula 
Wolfert points out in her classic "Couscous and Other Good Food From Morocco" 
(Harper &amp; Row: 1973), "Moroccan salads are more like Italian antipasti -- 
dishes of spiced or sweetened, cooked or raw vegetables served at the beginning 
of a meal to inspire the appetite and refresh the palate." Indeed, Ohayan adds, 
they're not even really appetizers but more like pre-appetizers. "For a big 
meal, we might start with a selection of seven, eight, ten salads, and then 
have our appetizer -- shad roe with sun-dried chiles, perhaps, or pastry 
stuffed with meat. Then we might have a tajine or grilled lamb." 
</P>
<P>
Like Morocco, of course, Southern California offers a profusion of fresh 
vegetables the whole year through. And the Moroccan restaurants of the area -- 
not just Koutoubia but El Moroccoin Hollywood, Marrakesh in Studio City and 
Almagreb in El Toro, among others -- all serve several varieties of Moroccan 
salads. The best known are a carrot salad flavored with ginger and cumin, and 
an eggplant salad made with cilantro and parsley. Here are three slightly more 
unusual ones, from Koutoubia. Michel Ohayan suggests offering a small serving 
of each on the same plate to make a colorful and unusual appetizer. 
</P>
<P>
TOMATO AND BELL PEPPER SALAD 
</P>
<P>
3 green bell peppers 
</P>
<P>
1 pound ripe tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
1 medium onion, minced 
</P>
<P>
3 teaspoons capers 
</P>
<P>
Juice of 2 lemons 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1 bunch parsley, minced 
</P>
<P>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Grill the peppers on a barbecue or directly on the flame of a gas burner, or 
broil in a hot oven, turning occasionally, until charred black on all sides. 
Allow to cool, cut in half lengthwise, flatten each half, then scrape blackened 
skin off with a knife. Remove seeds and ribs. Dice peppers and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Peel tomatoes by plunging them into boiling water for about 15 seconds, 
allowing to cool, then slipping skins off. Cut in half crosswise, remove seeds, 
and dice. 
</P>
<P>
Mix diced peppers and tomatoes in a bowl; add capers, lemon juice, olive oil 
and parsley. Add salt and pepper to taste and mix well. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
BEET SALAD 
</P>
<P>
2 large bunches beets 
</P>
<P>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup champagne or white wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
2 green onions 
</P>
<P>
Remove beet leaves and wash beets thoroughly. Add 1 teaspoon salt to 2 to 3 
quarts water and bring to a boil. Add beets, and simmer, covered, until tender 
(about 1 hour). When done, drain and cool; then peel and julienne beets. Place 
in a bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. 
</P>
<P>
In another bowl, mix well vinegar and olive oil. Stir in cumin and green 
onions, continuing to mix well. Gently add dressing to beets, being careful not 
to crush them, and allow to marinate for about 1 hour before serving. Makes 8 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
SWEET POTATO SALAD 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds sweet potatoes 
</P>
<P>
3 teaspoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 cinnamon stick 
</P>
<P>
1 cup fresh orange juice 
</P>
<P>
Juice of 2 lemons 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Bring 2 to 3 quarts of water to a boil. Peel sweet potatoes. Add sweet potatoes 
to water and simmer, covered for 45 minutes. When done, drain and allow to 
cool; then cut into 1/4-inch slices.

WINE: EXOTIC ENCORE; 
</P>
<P>
FOR DOMAINE DE LA ROMANEE-CONTI, ONE FINE VINTAGE FOLLOWS ANOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
THE TIME TO take tarts is when they are passing," folk wisdom says, "for (the 
tray) may not come again." And with the releases of 1986 Domaine de la 
Romanee-Conti wines, now is the time to take. Providing, of course, that one 
can spend between $89 and $300 per bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The '85 vintage was spectacular. The big question among wine lovers was whether 
the '86 wines would be just as good. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, I had tasted the 1986 La Tache in the cellars with Aubert de 
Villaine, co-owner of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. I found it awesome in its 
young perfection. The pleased, always restrained De Villaine said that he 
believed the '86 wines to be some of the best the Domaine has made. 
</P>
<P>
Then, this past February, I and 145 Southern California restaurateurs, 
hoteliers and wine merchants took part in a "pre-arrival" tasting of the '86 
wines. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipation and nervous excitement were tangible at the tasting. Tasters had 
to decide rather quickly which and how much of the wines they wanted to order, 
because quantities are always limited. The Domaine has only 49.7 acres on which 
its wines are produced, and only 8,600 cases of the 1986 vintage were made. 
</P>
<P>
The '86s are surprisingly good, dispelling gossip in the trade that bad weather 
had taken a toll. Vineyards of the Domaine are always among the last to be 
picked in Burgundy, and De Villaine daringly delayed harvest until the grapes 
were consummately ripe. De Villaine had gambled that the rain that fell in 
September would cease in October. October brought beautiful weather; the gamble 
paid off. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is more difficult than simplicity," De Villaine said last year. That 
simplicity accounts for the jewel-translucency of these Pinot Noir wines, which 
have subtlety that approaches fragility. Their aromas and bouquets of exotic 
complexity range from black currants, violets and faded roses to tar and orange 
peel -- ever-changing in the glass. Each becomes a memory-index standard of 
excellence. 
</P>
<P>
The Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Burgundies may be expensive, but they are 
perfect for toasting a special occasion. Here are my notes: 
</P>
<P>
1986 Echezeaux ($89). Surprisingly brick-edged ruby in color with scents 
suggesting a smoky Lapsang souchong tea, this wine has a tongue-wrapping 
richness and depth; 17 points out of a possible 20. 
</P>
<P>
1986 Grands Echezeaux ($149). This classical Pinot Noir wine has some berriness 
and a long aftertaste that is awesomely impressive; 17/20. 
</P>
<P>
1986 Romanee-St. Vivant ($155). Although the bouquet suggests that this wine is 
a closed bud, this is a full-bodied wine with elegance and rare finesse; 17/20. 
</P>
<P>
1986 Richebourg ($185). Very full, rich, almost languid in its lingering 
complexity. A superb wine; 18/20. 
</P>
<P>
1986 La Tache ($199). Already wholly gentle, its Pinot Noir breed evident, this 
wine is well balanced. It has wonderful fruit flavors, easily capturing 
affection for its nobility; 18/20. 
</P>
<P>
1986 Romanee-Conti ($290). Notably superior from the rest of the wines, this 
one defies description, combining all the pleasures of red wine in one glass of 
ever-changing delight; 19+/20.

LOOKS: FAIR-HAIRED BEAUTY; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHLIGHTING IS THE NAME OF THE GAME, EVEN FOR THOSE WHO WERE BORN BLOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
AT A TIME when hair colorists around the world are declaring warm-toned brown 
tresses the latest and greatest, along comes Kim Basinger, a golden-haired 
goddess seemingly thumbing her nose at the trend. As Batman's heartthrob, Vicki 
Vale, Basinger is Hollywood's quintessential blonde, her hair the brightest 
spot in sinister Gotham City. 
</P>
<P>
Even for a born blonde like Basinger, highlighting is key to a lustrous mane. 
The actress's Manhattan-based colorist, Louis Licari, touched-up her hair four 
times during four months of filming. "In 'Batman,' Kim had to be everyone's 
blond fantasy, so her hair had to be perfect. But most highlighting needs to be 
done only once every three months," says Licari, who also lightens the locks of 
Jessica Lange,Christie Brinkley,Rosanna Arquette, Kate Capshaw,Faye Dunawayand 
Lauren Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
When Licari adds highlights -- a service for which he charges $250 -- he 
concentrates on the top layers, leaving the hair underneath darker to give the 
illusion of depth. "On Basinger's light hair, the contrast is subtle," he says. 
"We just wanted to reflect more light." 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, says Licari, a consultant for Clairol, is placement of the 
highlights. Rather than adding color in an even application, he places it 
randomly, in bold strokes around the head, "to make the hair look sun 
streaked." 
</P>
<P>
In Beverly Hills, Jane Paddon,colorist and co-owner of The Burton Way 
Salon,says highlighting only the top layers of hair also means easier 
maintenance. "The more it grows out, the more natural it looks," Paddon 
explains. "Any sort of a bleached look is absolutely finished," she adds, 
noting that golden, reddish and honey blonds -- as well as lighter, creamy 
blonds -- have replaced harsh platinum. 
</P>
<P>
Dusty Fleming, a Beverly Hills salon owner, says that Southern California 
blondes, once known for their natural-looking sun-streaked hair, have lost 
their appeal by continually adding more color during touch-ups. "The overall 
effect is too light, especially when the sun continues to bleach it. They've 
gotten too brassy -- they look fake," he says. So Fleming places tints a shade 
darker on the hair adjacent to the highlights. "The contrast adds warmth and 
makes it look brighter, more natural," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Many women with highlighted hair are concerned with maintaining a consistent 
shade, but Licari, who highlights about 60 manes a week, says they shouldn't 
be: "It's natural to have the color change from season to season. Blonds always 
get lighter in summer." 
</P>
<P>
Harold Lapin, who bleached Marilyn Monroe's hair from dark ashblond to light 
platinum in the early '50s, complains that highlighting has dulled Hollywood's 
blondes. "It's just not as glamorous as when they were all platinum," he says. 
But the new Hollywood doesn't agree. Blond a la Basinger is its current ideal. 
Just ask Batman.

ANYONE WHO HAS watched a child play dress-up or ham it up for grandparents will 
attest to the fact that every kid has a certain amount of acting ability. 
Impromptu melodramas with friends or parts in the school play are usually 
sufficient outlets for this urge to act. But for more serious youngsters, 
theater workshops can help develop talent. Several Southern California theaters 
offer acting classes in summer workshops and in sessions that meet after school 
or on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Because most entering students are without experience, directors of acting 
workshops generally request an interview with the child and the parent. "We are 
looking for enthusiasm," says Cheryl Moffatt, director of young people's 
programs at the Santa Monica Playhouse, adding, "enthusiasm by the child -- not 
the parent." 
</P>
<P>
Programs usually include basic acting, improvisation and dance/movement. Some 
schools offer electives such as musical theater, makeup and combat (fencing). 
</P>
<P>
These are not classes for children whose parents want them to be the next child 
star. "We are not in the business of grinding out professional actors," says 
Kris Hagen, community services manager for the South Coast Repertory Young 
Conservatory. "We help children develop their creative abilities by 
experimenting, using their bodies, voices and emotions. These talents enrich 
them no matter what field of work they choose later in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting classes and theater workshops are offered at Santa Monica Playhouse in 
Santa Monica (age 6 to 16, and 13 to 18); Pasadena Playhouse Young Actors 
School in Pasadena (7 to 18); Orange County Children's Theatre in Fountain 
Valley (7 to 18); South Coast Repertory Young Conservatory in Costa Mesa(8 to 
17), and La Jolla Playhouse in La Jolla (8 to 18).

Regarding "How Fathers Figure," by Paul Ciotti: If one were stupid enough to 
rely on the documented findings of the male psychologists and physicians Ciotti 
refers to, one would conclude that boys raised by their mothers are unfriendly, 
immature, disobedient, cowardly, intellectually deficient and suffer low 
self-esteem. Because Ciotti can't come up with anything deep about fatherhood, 
he resorts to mother-bashing.

Elvis always respected his fans and sincerely liked them as something more than

them. What a shame that Elvis' money is being very well looked after, and his

illogical. The mere fact that She didn't inflict men with the ovaries negates 
the whole concept.

THE GODDESS THEORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was disturbed by the tone Jacques Leslie took regarding archeologists who 
disagree with Marija Gimbutas' vivid picture of prehistoric life in 
southeastern Europe ("The Goddess Theory," June 11). Leslie is prepared to 
render those archeologists as boring scholars "who think that archeology is 
legitimate only to the degree that it is grounded in science" -- as if this 
were a horrible insult? 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists must fight their desire to be flightful because other 
archeologists -- and, more important, the general public -- assume that what 
they propose has scientific grounds. The information generated by archeologists 
is considered scientific, and, as a result (rightly or wrongly) is often 
accepted as fact. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists of any kind have a responsibility to indicate the degree of 
certainty with which they are able to make claims or generate hypotheses, and 
they should be applauded when doing so, not condescended to.

CAPTIVE AUDIENCES; 
</P>
<P>
VIEWERS FIND THEY ARE AT MERCY OF THEIR COMMUNITY CABLE COMPANIES FOR PRICE, 
SERVICES, CHANNELS

<P>
You can choose your friends, your supermarket and the right to remain silent if 
you are arrested. But once you settle into a place to live, you cannot choose 
your cable television company. 
</P>
<P>
Like electricity and gas providers, cable companies are monopolies in the areas 
they serve, but with an important difference. Power companies provide a uniform 
product -- there is no discernible difference between the electricity provided 
by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and, say, Southern California 
Edison. But cable TV services and the prices you pay for them can vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 cable companies operate on the Westside and in the San Fernando, 
Conejo, Simi and Antelope valleys, each with a different fee schedule, channel 
lineup and installation charge. Among those systems surveyed for this article, 
the fees for basic service range from $10 to $19.90 a month, the installation 
charges run the gamut from $15 to $52, the number of channels available for a 
basic fee range from 10 to 48, and the charge for the most popular of the 
premium services, Home Box Office, ranges from $9.95 to $14.65 a month (see 
chart). 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for all this diversity are historical, political and financial. 
Some of these systems, especially in areas where television reception was 
extremely poor or non-existent before the advent of cable, are well over 20 
years old. They were built long before technology expanded the number of 
available channels and enhanced the quality of reception. 
</P>
<P>
Others came on line during the cable boom years of the late 1970s and early 
1980s, when the competition to wire urban areas was intense. In bidding wars, 
cable companies promised municipalities large numbers of basic and pay 
services, plus other goodies such as public access and local government 
channels, pay-per-view capability and stereo sound. 
</P>
<P>
Until Dec. 29, 1986, municipalities could regulate the fees that cable 
companies charged customers, but that considerable bargaining chip was taken 
away by a federal cable deregulation law that bars state and local governments 
from setting rates. Fees have, not surprisingly, gone up since then. According 
to Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), who introduced legislation in May to bring 
back some regulation to the industry, basic cable service prices have risen 32% 
nationally since deregulation. Cable operators have spoken out against the 
proposed legislation, which is still in committee, saying that fees were kept 
artificially low when they were regulated and that they needed to bring in more 
income to update and maintain their systems. 
</P>
<P>
The following is a capsule look at cable operators serving the Westside and the 
valleys: 
</P>
<P>
ATC-American Cable Vision: Serving 18,800 customers, out of a potential 
subscriber base of almost 21,500 in Canyon Country, this system is owned by one 
of the industry giants -- American Television Communications, which itself is 
82% owned by Time Warner, which also owns HBO and Cinemax. 
</P>
<P>
Cablevision: With 77,000 subscribers out of a possible 180,000 households, West 
Valley Cablevision is the largest cable operator in the San Fernando Valley. It 
serves an area west of the San Diego Freeway plus the city of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
CalaVision: This relatively small system, built in 1969 in Calabasas, has 1,200 
customers out of a possible 1,500. Cable professionals call this a captive 
system because over-the-air television reception in the area is poor. 
</P>
<P>
Capp's Electronics: Only 203 households (out of 253) subscribe to this system 
in Lake Hughes, about 20 miles northeast of Castaic Lake. Owned by electronics 
dealer Capp Loughboro of Ventura, it is, by far, the smallest system in the 
area. 
</P>

Century Cable: The lucrative Westside market has been a headache for this huge 
system, which has the largest number of subscribers of the 17 companies 
surveyed (143,900 in Los Angeles County). Begun by Howard Hughes in the early 
1950s, the system has gone through several owners, most recently Century, which 
purchased it in 1987. The system includes the communities of Beverly Hills, 
Santa Monica and West Hollywood, all of which have taken an active role in 
overseeing their cable service. Indeed, last year, because of numerous 
complaints about customer service, the Beverly Hills City Council collected 
fines from Century, accusing the company of violating service provisions in its 
contract. At the time William Rosendahl, vice president of Century, complained 
that the area probably had the toughest standards in the country for cable 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, West Hollywood threatened to break its contract with Century over 
the service issue last year, and Santa Monica has been negotiating over the 
franchise renewal for years. 
</P>
<P>
This year the controversies have cooled in Beverly Hills and West Hollywood, 
and Rosendahl said the company is finalizing its negotiations with Santa 
Monica. He also said Century is partway through a massive rebuilding program to 
make it state-of-the-art. 
</P>
<P>
But controversy is likely to stir again when Century increases its rates for 
basic service Sept. 1 to $19 in West Hollywood and Beverly Hills and to $18.25 
in all its other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Cablevision: This system, one of the largest in the Los Angeles 
area, includes Venice, Mar Vista, Culver City, Palms and parts of Marina del 
Ray, West Los Angeles and Hollywood. (There are 86,000 subscribers in Los 
Angeles County.) 
</P>
<P>
Until the system was bought by American Cablesystems in 1986, large portions of 
</P>
<P>
its franchise area in Hollywood remained unwired for cable, much to the 
consternation of its residents. American began an expansion that wired about 
25,000 additional households per year and that expansion has been continued by 
Continental Cablevision, which took over in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
According to Continental's director of marketing, Ed Gorman, all but about 
50,000 homes in its service area are wired for cable and the expansion 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
Comcast Cablevision: Covering portions of Simi Valley, the system is undergoing 
a rebuilding and expansion of services. This month four channels, including 
VH-1 and C-Span, were added to its basic service lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Comcast has 23,400 subscribers out of a possible 32,000. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley Cable: This small system in the La Crescenta area has about 
1,500 subscribers, out of a possible 3,000, getting its 31 basic channels. 
</P>
<P>
Falcon Cable TV: Covering unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County in the 
vicinity of Calabasas, Topanga Canyon and Woodland Hills, plus parts of Malibu 
and Thousand Oaks, Falcon has largely a captive audience that cannot receive 
much television without cable. Parts of its system are more than 20 years old, 
which has led to reception problems. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thousand Oaks took the serious step of commissioning an $18,000 
study of the situation. At the time, city officials said the study was 
undertaken in case the city decided to change cable operators when the system 
came up for refranchising in 1991 (under federal law, a city must provide 
evidence as to why it wants to switch companies). 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Thousand Oaks employee Carol Williams said that although the study is 
an "ongoing process," in the last year Falcon has shown a willingness to work 
with city officials to formulate a plan to rebuild and improve the system. 
Falcon has 13,500 subscribers out of a possible 17,000. 
</P>
<P>
Jones Intercable: In a rapidly growing area of the Antelope Valley, this system 
covering Palmdale, Lancaster and California City has 43,000 subscribers out of 
a possible 65,000. 
</P>
<P>
King VideoCable: Now undergoing a two-year, $7-million rebuilding project to 
replace equipment throughout the system, King covers a large area that includes 
Sunland, Tujunga, Sylmar, Pacoima, Newhall Saugus and Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sunland-Tujunga area, it is known for a particularly active, locally 
oriented public access channel, which includes a local newscast several nights 
a week. (The newscast, which has been off for the past several months during 
the rebuilding, is due to be revived soon.) Subscribers in the area pay 50 
cents a month extra to support the channel. King has 26,000 subscribers out of 
a possible 39,000. 
</P>
<P>
Littlerock Cable TV: This system has a two-tier basic price system that offers 
10 channels for a monthly charge of $10. For an additional $5.50, customers get 
an additional 14 channels. 
</P>
<P>
It has 2,000 subscribers out of a possible 3,000. The company is working on an 
expansion that will double its level of potential subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Lost Hills Communications: This new system near the Hidden Hills area serves a 
small group of new homes. It has 922 subscribers our of a possible 1,142. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain Meadows Cable: This small system in Moorpark has a perfect record: 
Every one of the 1,500 households in its area subscribes to the system. It only 
serves the Mountain Meadows tract of homes, which were all pre-wired for cable. 
</P>
<P>
Sammons Communications: The system in Glendale and Burbank, which was 
originally built in 1962, underwent a major rebuilding in 1979. It is expanding 
into a previously unwired, 1,000-home area of La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
The latest improvement to service, which reaches 60,000 subscribers out of a 
potential 116,000, is the addition of stereo sound to the pay channels that 
Sammons offers. 
</P>
<P>
United Cable TV: Of all the cable systems in the survey, United certainly had 
the most trouble getting off the ground. The company won the franchise to wire 
the San Fernando Valley area east of the San Diego Freeway, including Van Nuys 
and North Hollywood, in 1983 with a promise that the system would be completed 
by Dec. 7, 1985. After several extentions and paying the city of Los Angeles 
fines of more than $450,000 because of delays, the system was finally declared 
complete on May 11, 1989. United still isn't out of the woods on the fines 
front -- a decision is pending in the City Council over whether to levy an 
additional $300,000 in fines, also because of the delays. United has 53,000 
subscribers out of a possible 147,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Cablevision: Ventura covers all of Camarillo, Fillmore, Santa 
Paula and Ojai, and parts of Thousand Oaks and Moorpark. It also extends into 
Agoura Hills and parts of Calabasas and Las Virgenes. It has 77,500 subscribers 
out of a possible 95,000.

ART NOTEBOOK: ARTISTS SHAPIRO, APPLE CLOSE OUT SMARTS FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Arts Council's 1989 performance art festival concludes with 
two more events next Saturday and Aug. 12, with performances by local artists 
Elisha Shapiro and Jacki Apple. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
SMARTS' program, which consists of six site-specific performance pieces, will 
continue to be held at the Ocean Park performance platforms, designed by 
sculptor Joyce Kohl. The platforms are adjacent to the Santa Monica Promenade, 
just north of where Ocean Park Boulevard meets the beach. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 5, Shapiro, who presented himself as a 1988 presidential candidate 
under his own Nihilist Party, will be giving an art performance of unspecified 
content. Before the performance, he will hold a press conference announcing the 
first Nihilism Expo that he is planning for the Los Angeles area in August, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro will also identify several local artists who plan to perform at or 
build pavilions for the Expo. Pavilions, he said, will include the Hall of 
Traffic, the Hall of Crime and Nihilists from Many Lands. 
</P>
<P>
The Expo is not without precedent. Shapiro held a Nihilist Olympics 
concurrently with Los Angeles' 1984 Summer Olympics, with contestants battling 
for medals in traffic maneuvering and smashing sculpture with sledgehammers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think L.A.'s seen anything like this Expo, and it's a shame," Shapiro 
said. "There's Disneyland, Universal Studios and that Arts Festival thing, but 
nothing for people outside of the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
Apple's piece, "fluctuations of the field," is a follow-up to "Palisade," 
another site-specific performance in the 1987 SMARTS Festival. It will be 
presented Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Fluctuations" will feature more than 30 artists, performers and musicians, 
including members of the Death Valley Croquet Club. Also included will be 
roller skaters, dancers, drummers from around the world, yo-yo artists and a 
tuba player refereeing the croquet match. 
</P>
<P>
The Shapiro and Apple events close out the 1989 SMARTS Festival, which also 
receives financial support from the National State County Partnership and the 
Cactus Foundation. It opened July 8 with a performance by "avant-garde lounge 
singer" Weba Garretson. Successive Saturdays saw performances by Linda 
Albertano and the Chicago performance art group X meets Y, as well as Joyce 
Wexler-Ballard's "Line Down the Middle" and Tobi Redlich's "Rocky 
</P>
<P>
Shore." 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the Shapiro and Apple performances is free, and all events begin 
at 3 p.m. Parking is available nearby, just south of where Barnard Way meets 
Ocean Park Boulevard. For further information call (213) 936-1447. 
</P>
<P>
MONTAGE &amp; COLLAGE: A major exhibition of 20th-Century photomontages and 
photocollages opens at the Jan Turner Gallery this Friday, with a reception 
from 5 to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Photocollage, the physical juxtaposition of photos, and photomontage, the 
manipulation of multiple images in the darkroom, was a major form of expression 
for Dadaists and Surrealists of the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"The Changing Picture 1920-1989" is a survey examining the development of these 
art forms from the heyday of the Dadaists and Surrealists, through the mass 
media influenced Pop Art movement of the 1960s, to the eclectic, 
video-influenced artists of the present. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40 artists are represented, including the Berlin Dadaists John 
Heartfield and Hannah Houch; avant-garde Eastern Europeans such as Gustav 
Klutsis and Mieczyslaw Berman; Deconstructivists the Starn Twins; Pop Art 
trailblazer Roy Lichtenstein, and other modern artists, including John 
Baldessari and David Hockney. The exhibit, curated by Craig Krull, continues 
through Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Turner Gallery, 8000 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles (213) 658-6080. Open Tuesday 
through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

TEAM SPIRIT HELPS REPRISE AN ACCESSIBLE AGATHA CHRISTIE WHODUNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV

<TEXT>
<P>
Bruce Gray figures that Agatha Christie is a name people can trust. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great way to bring someone into the theater who's never been there 
before," said the director. "For people who might be afraid of going to see 
Shakespeare or Chekhov or even David Rabe, Agatha Christie is something they 
are comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
"Theater can be very confrontative. And when it really works well, it can be 
upsetting. But this is accessible. When people come to see Agatha Christie, 
they know what they're in for." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, Gray's staging of Christie's "The Unexpected Guest" opens at the 
Tiffany Theatre in West Hollywood, in a reprise of his acclaimed production 
that ran at Beverly Hills' Theatre 40 in June. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more than a whodunit," emphasized Gray, 52. "It deals with bigger 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
The play begins with the title character entering a dark room and coming upon a 
dead man -- and the victim's wife standing next to him with a gun. "The victim 
is one of those Hemingway-type men: into big-game hunting, lived fast, drank a 
lot. Then he was mauled by a lion in Kenya and became a cripple. And all the 
things that were wonderful about him disappeared; all the terrible things 
bubbled to the surface." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The suspects are all members of the household. "This man had disrupted and 
alienated and abused everyone in the family," Gray explained. "He was just an 
awful human being who deserved to die. There's even something about the room 
that's violent. It's filled with African masks and skulls, animal heads, zebra 
and tiger skins, an elephant foot stuffed with magazines and newspapers. I 
mean, it's really awful. But now he's dead -- and how do they feel about it?" 
</P>
<P>
The director's own feelings are definitely mixed with nostalgia. Born in Puerto 
Rico, he grew up in Michigan, got a master's in psychology from the University 
of Toronto and moved to England in the late '50s, where he ended up modeling 
and acting. Eventually, he was invited to join the Theatre Royal in Bath -- 
where one of his 14-plays-in-14-weeks repertory included a role in "The 
Unexpected Guest." 
</P>
<P>
This time around with the show, Gray only had eyes for directing. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't do them both -- acting and directing," he said firmly. "The 
directing's too demanding. As a director, at the opening of a play, I'm totally 
spent. There's nothing I haven't had a hand in: the set design, the costumes, 
the lighting, the sound, getting the flyers done, the programs, making sure 
everything has the right look about it. It's a huge management job: managing a 
cast of nine and a crew of 20 and getting them to work harmoniously -- for 
appalling money." 
</P>
<P>
Financial woes notwithstanding, team spirit has been strong: "It's like Mickey 
Rooney-Judy Garland 'Let's put on a show,' " Gray said proudly. "One of the 
people in the cast took on the moving: 'It will be my job to move all the 
furniture and flats to the Tiffany.' Someone else said, 'I'll do the programs.' 
Someone else is handling the opening-night party. Everyone is acting as 
producers, pulling together. It's not Bruce Gray who's going into this theater. 
It's this company." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the rigors involved in mounting a show, Gray believes that the 
theater is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a very different experience going to a theater than going to a 
movie," he said. "In theater, there's much more of a relationship between the 
members of the audience and the show -- and it's different every night. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I went to a theater I remember wondering, 'Gee, what goes on 
here? Is it going to be embarrassing? Are they going to ask me questions?' 
Theater is very present, you know. An actor can suddenly decide to walk off the 
stage and sit next to you. That's part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Gray's own acting has run the gamut from a slew of New York soap operas to 10 
years at Circle Repertory and films such as "Dragnet" and "Let's Get Harry." 
Since moving here in 1980, he has developed high visibility in what a friend 
calls "suit acting": playing lawyers on "Dynasty," "Dallas," "Knots Landing," 
"The Colbys" and the new daytime soap "Generations." 
</P>
<P>
"Acting and directing address different parts of your talent," Gray pointed 
out. "As a director, there's a feeling of emptying yourself into a show: your 
sensibilities, your judgment, your willingness to be the wall. Sometimes an 
actor wants that; they want you to say no. Other actors don't need that. It's 
about dealing with people, understanding a group dynamic -- and after you've 
cast it well, trusting the actors, encouraging them in the direction they're 
going." 
</P>
<P>
And acting? Gray sighed. 
</P>
<P>
"Often the five minutes that ends up on the screen took three days to shoot, a 
couple of weeks out of your life. It's not terribly satisfying. Not that I 
don't do my damnedest to give a good performance: I try to be dangerous and 
courageous, give the director something he can work with. But usually you're 
just a vehicle for some plot point in the story. So working on the stage is a 
great outlet. If I had my druthers, I'd never act again. Really. I'd make the 
switch in a minute."

AMERICAN FOLK PAINTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM BURCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FROM COLONIAL TIMES, and particularly during the first half of the 
19th-Century, there has been a rich tradition of folk art in America. Painting 
was one of its most popular manifestations, and portraits were enthusiastically 
commissioned by the developing middle class. Doctors, lawyers and ministers, 
merchants and sea captains, the landed gentry -- all were eager to have their 
likenesses made to provide proof of their status. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, the Ammi Phillips paired portraits of Dr. Isaac Everest 
and his wife, Sarah Cornwall (sold at Christie's in 1988). In it the doctor is 
shown holding an open book, a sign of literacy at the time and usually 
represented in portraits of doctors and lawyers. For a sea captain, a view of 
his ship was appropriate. In depictions of women and children, a family pet, a 
toy or a piece of jewelry might be included. 
</P>
<P>
In those early days, portrait painters were in demand, and for the most part 
they were self-taught. These itinerant artists (or limners, as they came to be 
called) were a common sight in small New England towns, as well as in the 
Southern states and later in the Midwest. Artists were skilled at using oils, 
pastels and watercolor. The works were simple: Often, details were omitted, 
overall shape emphasized and perspective non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
These charming portraits are admired today not only as art but also as vivid 
social history. The limners were kept busy until the development of the 
daguerreotype in 1840 made their work largely obsolete. After that date, many 
of them turned to photography. 
</P>
<P>
Folk portraiture is a field full of pleasant surprises for the collector. 
Though the works of the painters whose identities are known are expensive 
(portraits by Ammi Phillips and John Brewster regularly bring five figures), 
the works of anonymous artists are still available and are, of course, far less 
costly. 
</P>
<P>
Today Latin, Afro-American and Native American folk art portraiture of the 
1980s shares with the wandering limners of 19th-Century America a similar 
startling directness and simplicity, the same vibrant color and charm. 
</P>
<P>
Folk painting is available at Vivian Farren, Richard Mulligan (to the trade), 
Margaret Cavigga, Millstein's General Store, and Antique Mart of Los Angeles in 
Los Angeles; Main Street USA in Venice; Richard Yeakel Antiques in Laguna 
Beach; Uncle Tom's Antiques in Orange; Green Dolphin Street in Pasadena, and 
The Snow Goose and Norma Dee in La Jolla.

GOVERNORS' REPORT URGES ACTION ON TRANSPORTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
State governments should take the lead in strengthening the country's 
transportation system to help make the United States more competitive in world 
markets, according to a National Governors' Assn. task force report issued here 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But the report, released as state chief executives gathered here for the 
association's conference, said the federal government should help the states 
meet the cost of transportation improvements by delivering revenues accumulated 
in various federal trust funds for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"Billions of dollars that are committed to transportation uses, and only to 
transportation uses, are being held in the budget in Washington and not being 
spent out in America where they are supposed to be spent so that the (federal) 
budget deficit looks smaller," said Republican Gov. James R. Thompson of 
Illinois, the task force chairman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$13 Billion Involved 
</P>
<P>
Governors' association staffers said that more than $13 billion was involved, 
most of it in the highway trust fund raised by gasoline taxes and the aviation 
trust fund financed by taxes on airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have contended that the money is needed to meet future 
expenditures by the states. 
</P>
<P>
The task force report urged states to take the initiative in establishing 
partnership arrangements with local governments, with federal agencies and with 
the private sectors to find new approaches to transportation planning and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"This nation needs to devote its attention to finding ways to improve all types 
of transportation infrastructure -- highways, mass transit, airports and 
seaports," said Thompson. "We must bring them up to this century and the 
fast-approaching 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
The transportation report was the final one in a series of six task force 
studies issued by the governors' group in the last year, all with the overall 
purpose of improving U.S. competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Identify Needs 
</P>
<P>
Because of their close involvement with ownership and operation of 
transportation facilities, states are in the best position to identify needs, 
manage programs and build and operate improved transportation systems, the 
report said, but the federal government, in addition to accelerating outlay of 
trust fund revenues, should remove present limits on use of tax-exempt 
financing for transportation improvements by state and local governments. Also, 
the report urged Washington to increase its own spending for research and 
development to encourage technological improvements in transportation 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of doing business is influenced by how well we move goods and 
people," said Thompson. "For every dollar of export goods, about 25 cents is 
spent on the transportation of raw materials, semi-finished goods and 
components between domestic manufacturers." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement reviewing the association's work in the trade area, Gov. Gerald 
L. Baliles, a Virginia Democrat and the association chairman, stressed that 
close coordination is needed on a broad front. "As we have improved in one area 
of global competitiveness we have quickly realized that all the wheels must 
turn in concert," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baliles said previous reports have dealt with the search for new markets 
abroad, communication with trading partners and competitors, investment in 
technology, education, work force training, access to capital and child welfare 
and development. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Bush to Speak 
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, which officially opens today, will hear an address by 
President Bush on Monday and will discuss subjects ranging from drugs and 
education to telecommunications and energy. But one topic that is not on the 
official agenda is the hottest issue now facing state politicians -- the 
controversy resulting from the Supreme Court decision last month giving the 
states broader authority to regulate abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Baliles said that the decision had come too late to be included on the 
conference agenda, planning on which began about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Baliles said: "This is a topic that will have to be argued within 
each state, depending on the political situation in each state. It is a topic 
that is unlikely to achieve the kind of consensus that would produce a policy 
resolution through the National Governors' Assn."

GOVERNORS OF GREAT LAKES STATES SIGN OIL SPILL CLEANUP ACCORD 
</P>

<P>
In what they described as a direct reaction to last spring's Alaskan oil spill, 
governors of the eight states bordering the Great Lakes agreed Saturday to 
establish a region-wide plan for cleaning up spills of petroleum products and 
hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed . . . to developing an effective plan to both prevent oil 
spills and to provide quick response in the event of such an accident," said 
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, chairman of the Council of Great Lakes 
Governors. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed as the nation's governors gathered in Chicago for the 
meeting of the National Governors' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Form Closed System 
</P>
<P>
The five Great Lakes hold 20% of the world's fresh water and supply drinking 
water to 30 million Midwesterners. They are a major economic and recreational 
resource and a major route for migratory birds. Unlike oceans, they form a 
closed system unable to flush out hazardous spills. And, unlike the Atlantic 
and Pacific coasts, they are not included in national oil and hazardous 
material spill strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard Appelbaum, who met with the governors Saturday, 
said that his agency was already studying a worst-case spill plan for the Great 
Lakes but that the responsibility for any cleanup belongs to private industry. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 81 million barrels of refined petroleum products and hazardous 
materials are shipped on the Great Lakes each year in tankers. Additional 
shipments are made on barges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Another Threat 
</P>
<P>
"Stationary sources of potential spills may be a greater threat," said Michigan 
Gov. James J. Blanchard, citing heavy industry, chemical plants and storage 
tanks near the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
In the agreement, the governors pledged to establish an emergency spill control 
plan for each state, to maintain a central catalogue of spill-fighting 
equipment and expertise and to try to set up at least one center specifically 
designed to respond to a spill. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is the latest in a series of initiatives by Great Lakes 
governors. In 1986 they agreed to ban oil drilling in the lakes and last year 
they set up a fund to fight toxic pollution in the lakes.

FAR-REACHING BILL TO PROTECT DISABLED FROM DISCRIMINATION GAINS SPEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Rep. Tony Coelho suffered seizures for six years, starting when he was 
about 15 years old. He had epilepsy caused by a head injury suffered in an 
automobile accident. 
</P>
<P>
But he did not know that. His parents, holding to an ancient belief, told him 
that he was possessed by the devil and took him to witch doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho finally found out what was wrong after he was denied entry to a Roman 
Catholic seminary based on his medical exam. But when he sought other jobs, 
potential employers also turned him down. He lost his driver's license. He 
became depressed and suicidal and began drinking heavily. "It hit me pretty 
hard," he says. "I felt total rejection." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bipartisan Support 
</P>
<P>
It was his personal experience that drove Coelho to sponsor and push hard for 
the Americans With Disabilities Act, a measure that would protect all disabled 
Americans against discrimination in private-sector employment and public 
accommodations -- the same rights that are already guaranteed on the basis of 
race by the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho (D-Merced) is no longer in Congress, but the bill has been quietly 
gaining speed in recent months on Capitol Hill with widespread bipartisan 
support and now appears destined for passage. 
</P>
<P>
"Discrimination against people with disabilities remains pervasive in our 
society," said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), one of the bill's chief sponsors in 
the Senate. "People with disabilities are entitled to lead independent and 
productive lives, and they are entitled to make choices for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Harkin remembers visiting his brother, who is deaf, in the hospital and having 
his brother tell him: "This thing must be broken," referring to the nurse call 
button on the wall. "I keep pushing for my medicine and nobody comes." So 
Harkin pressed it, and a voice boomed into the room: "Hello. May I help you?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bans Bias by Employers 
</P>
<P>
The bill before Congress would prohibit discrimination based on handicap by all 
private businesses employing 15 or more people, unless the person otherwise was 
not qualified for the job. The measure would also require employers to make 
"reasonable accommodations" for the disabled in the workplace by removing 
physical barriers or providing special equipment, unless doing so poses an 
"undue hardship." 
</P>
<P>
All new buildings and public transportation would have to be accessible to 
disabled individuals. Existing facilities -- including theaters, restaurants 
and hotels, for example -- must make modest changes to accommodate disabled 
persons. 
</P>
<P>
In a particularly far-reaching provision, the bill also would require telephone 
companies to put in place special relay systems to enable those with 
communication disorders to make calls. With non-voice telephone devices, the 
deaf and others would communicate with a telephone operator who, in turn, would 
relay the conversation verbally to the individual on the other end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affects AIDS Patients 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, although the acronym AIDS appears nowhere in the proposed 
measure, the bill defines persons with contagious diseases as handicapped. 
Thus, it would also afford protection to people who have the deadly disease, to 
those who are infected with the virus -- and to those who may even be perceived 
to be infected. The latter point is an important distinction, since relatives 
of AIDS patients have often themselves been the target of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Under this definition, more than 40 million Americans would be considered 
disabled. Through its broad scope, the bill has forged a massive and unusual 
coalition of supporters. "You can see paralyzed vets in their wheelchairs 
passing out information about AIDS, and AIDS activists arguing in favor of 
retrofitting buses," said one congressional aide who has worked on the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS protections alone embody what members of the public health community 
have repeatedly said could be the single most important tool to curbing the 
burgeoning epidemic. Many medical experts have long believed that once those at 
risk for AIDS know that they cannot be the subject of discrimination, they will 
be more willing to undergo testing for AIDS infection and can better receive 
treatment and education about the disease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extends Existing Law 
</P>
<P>
The measure builds on partial protections for the handicapped already in 
federal law. The 1973 Rehabilitation Act already forbids discrimination against 
the handicapped in programs and facilities that receive federal funds, but 
advocates for disabled persons and AIDS activists have argued that the 
provisions must be extended to the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
There were numerous calls for such legislation during the Ronald Reagan years, 
but they brought no action. Reagan said that the ideas needed more study, and 
preferred that action on such measures be left to state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush More Receptive 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has been more receptive. "The last day I was in office I called 
President Bush and asked him to recommit himself to the bill and try to get it 
done this year," said Coelho, who resigned from the House last month to avoid 
an Ethics Committee investigation of the circumstances surrounding his purchase 
of a junk bond. "And he said 'yes.' He said: 'Yes, absolutely, let's get it 
done this year.' I respect him for that." 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials have a few problems with the bill, but have 
expressed overall broad support for its goals and have indicated that Bush will 
sign it. The measure, also sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
already has 48 co-sponsors in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Opposition 
</P>
<P>
While the White House support has provided a big push, there is strong 
opposition, particularly in the business community. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the "reasonable accommodation" section, Zachary Fasman, 
representing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in recent testimony before the 
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee that "the costs of this action would 
be enormous and obviously could have a disastrous impact upon many small 
businesses struggling to survive." Further, he said, "Imposition of these costs 
on employers threatens to make American business even less competitive in our 
increasingly global economy." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill, on the other hand, argue that the costs of making the 
changes would be small, especially compared to the amount society now spends to 
support those with disabilities, particularly those now unable to work. 
</P>
<P>
Fasman also criticized a provision of the bill that defines alcohol and drug 
abuse as handicaps, saying that it has the potential to create "safety 
ramifications regarding customers, clients and the public at large." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "It is particularly inappropriate that Congress should be considering 
such provisions at the same time that American business is increasingly being 
required, 
</P>
<P>
by federal agencies, to create and preserve a drug-free workplace." 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Silverstein, staff director and chief counsel to the Senate 
subcommittee on the handicapped, said that the provision requiring an 
individual to be qualified for the job eliminates such potential difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"You must show that you are qualified," he said. "If you use drugs, or sell 
them, or engage in abusive behavior or absenteeism -- if your behavior is not 
consistent with the rules -- you get fired. The key is qualifications. The 
person has to be qualified . . . to be hired and to keep the job." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), who has long been opposed to AIDS 
anti-discrimination legislation, said that he plans to fight the bill in the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to AIDS patients and drug and alcohol abusers, he said that people 
who "engage in such activities . . . have no case worthy of being brought 
within the reach of handicapped status. It's kind of like the young man who 
shoots both his parents and then throws himself on mercy of court because he's 
an orphan." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the bill is expected to be approved in both houses, possibly with 
some amendments, and to be sent to the President. It may reach the Senate floor 
for a vote shortly after lawmakers return from their August recess. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is a revolutionary bill, no doubt about it," said Pat Wright, 
director of the East Coast office of the Disability Rights Education and 
Defense Fund. "It will change the way America is. It will make a society that 
is totally open to all Americans, not just to those who are able-bodied."

Thomas Root, who survived after his plane wandered 800 miles along the East 
Coast and crashed into the Atlantic, said Saturday he did not set out to kill 
himself but briefly considered suicide waiting to be rescued. 
</P>
<P>
"It was at that moment that -- and only that moment -- that I ever stared the 
notion of suicide right in the face," Root said. "It sent -- it was almost a 
jolt of electricity, right through me. The very thought running through my 
mind. . . . I started swimming, swimming erratically and hard, and wasted 
energy in the process before I calmed myself down." 
</P>
<P>
Root made his comments in an interview broadcast Saturday by radio station 
WSWR. Root is an owner of the station in this north-central Ohio community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At Parents' Home 
</P>
<P>
WSWR reporter Jim Norris said he interviewed Root on Thursday at the home of 
Root's parents in Plymouth, Ohio, where he has been recovering from his 
injuries, which included an unexplained gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
Norris said Root left Plymouth later Saturday headed for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Root, 36, an Alexandria, Va., communications lawyer, was en route from 
Washington's National Airport to Rocky Mount, N.C., July 13 when he told air 
traffic controllers he was having trouble breathing. He put his plane on 
autopilot and military planes kept watch on him until his plane ran out of fuel 
and ditched near the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Remember Wound 
</P>
<P>
Root said he was unconscious until the plane hit the water and did not know how 
he received a gunshot wound to the abdomen, which doctors noticed after his 
rescue. He checked out of a Hollywood, Fla., hospital Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Root said pain and exhaustion almost overcame him while he fought to stay 
afloat until rescuers could arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"I hurt an awful lot while I was swimming, and I don't know why. I knew I had a 
knot in my stomach. I knew it was very difficult to use my left arm," he said.

14 KILLED DURING REBEL ROCKET ATTACKS ON KABUL

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A barrage of rockets fired by Muslim guerrillas slammed into Kabul on Saturday, 
with one spraying shrapnel and glass around a crowded bazaar. At least 14 
people were killed in the attacks, official Radio Kabul said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani said the U.S.-backed guerrillas 
are stepping up such attacks to give them more leverage before Monday's 
U.S.-Soviet talks on Afghanistan in Stockholm. The Soviets, who fought 
alongside Afghan government troops for nine years, are the Marxist government's 
major arms supplier. 
</P>
<P>
Official Radio Kabul, in a broadcast monitored in Islamabad, Pakistan, said 14 
people were killed and 50 injured in the attacks. Amani, however, said 12 
people were killed. Eight people died and 40 were injured when the rocket hit 
the bazaar, he said, while four others died when rockets landed around the 
center and south of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
In the past month, the rebels, who are fighting to establish an Islamic 
republic in Afghanistan, have been launching long-range rockets from behind the 
hills that ring Kabul. More than 200 people have died, virtually all of them 
civilians.

A would-be robber walked up to a vehicle parked near the Sunset Strip early 
Saturday, ordered the driver to roll down his window and shot him to death when 
he refused, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony John McCubbin, 32, an English national who resided in Los Angeles, died 
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center minutes after the incident -- one of four fatal 
shootings being investigated by Los Angeles County authorities during the early 
part of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Police said McCubbin -- a special effects technician who worked at rock 
concerts and other staged events -- and two friends were leaving the North 
Kings Road home of a business associate, where they had spent the evening. 
</P>
<P>
McCubbin and his friends -- a man and a woman -- had just entered his Jeep 
Cherokee, parked on the east side of the Hyatt Hotel, at about 1:50 a.m. when a 
man carrying a handgun walked up to the driver's window, Detective Russell 
Kuster said. 
</P>
<P>
"The gunman . . . ordered the victim to roll down the window," Kuster said. 
"When the victim refused, he was summarily shot (through the window) by the 
suspect." 
</P>
<P>
The gunman fled in a small yellow vehicle, Kuster said, adding that detectives 
believe he had intended to rob his victims. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident, a 17-year-old youth was shot to death while on his way 
to visit a friend late Friday night, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Timothy Wilson, 17, was gunned down moments after parking his car on 
54th Street in South-Central Los Angeles, in what investigators said was a 
gang-related incident. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson had left his car and was crossing Central Avenue at 54th Street about 
11:05 p.m. when a man -- armed with a shotgun -- shouted a gang greeting 
mockingly, and then fired several shots at him, Detective Bernie Skiles said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was hit in the chest and left side of his head. He staggered to a nearby 
alley, where he collapsed and died, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman ran from the area. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's sister and a friend, both 14, witnessed the shooting from the car. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, sheriff's deputies were called to Will Rogers Memorial Park 
in Watts to investigate a shooting and found the bullet-riddled body of a young 
man. Deputies said the victim, who was shot in the upper torso, was Payton 
Johnson, 18. 
</P>
<P>
No motive had been found for the slaying and there were no arrests. The 
shooting did not appear to be gang-related, Deputy Van Moseley said. 
</P>
<P>
A teen-age boy was killed Saturday in a burst of gang gunfire from a car in 
South-Central Los Angeles, minutes before an anti-gang task force arrived in 
the area, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose name was not released, and a teen-age companion, were shot in 
the 300 block of East 78th Street. The surviving victim was taken to Martin 
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, Sgt. Randy Minini said, adding that there 
were no further details. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 Los Angeles police officers fanned out Saturday evening for another 
"Operation Hammer" anti-gang task force operation in neighborhoods plagued by 
gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
"We will enforce every law we have available to us," Detective Tony Celli said. 
</P>
<P>
The last "Hammer" operation, during the July 4 weekend. netted 412 arrests, 
Celli said. Arrest figures involving Saturday night's operation were not 
available, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
A similar operation is scheduled for tonight, police said.

<P>
Marcos Chicuate Castro toes the curb, tracking the whizzing cars with a 
seasoned eye, flinging his right arm out when a truck passes or he catches a 
driver's attention. 
</P>
<P>
A white GMC truck pulls into the gas station across the street, and the driver 
lets out a shrill whistle. Castro and half a dozen other men sprint across the 
street to where the truck is parked. 
</P>
<P>
Someone else gets the nod, and Castro crosses back to his spot at Kester Avenue 
near Victory Boulevard in Van Nuys. It is 8 a.m., and he has been on the 
lookout for a job for about half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Castro comes as often as six days a week to the site, which laborers call Las 
Piedras (The Rocks). Strangers pick him up and take him to building sites, 
homes and warehouses to garden, clean or paint. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hinges on Variables 
</P>
<P>
Like thousands of other day laborers on Los Angeles streets, whether he gets 
picked up depends on many factors -- such as the weather, the construction 
business, and his audacity and speed. 
</P>
<P>
His earnings have ranged from $100 to $250 a week. But despite the fact that 
most people would have a hard time living on such meager wages, the 25-year-old 
Castro, in the United States illegally, is upbeat: "It's a gold mine here. If 
you're patient, you'll be able to get something," he said in Spanish through an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Although he sleeps on the floor of a cramped apartment, has no car and longs 
for his family in Mexico, jobs are more plentiful in the San Fernando Valley 
than where he came from. 
</P>
<P>
Castro is tidy in black jeans, with two gold chains tucked inside a red 
pullover jacket; his mustache is neatly trimmed and he wears a baseball cap. He 
smiles sincerely when he has a job prospect. 
</P>
<P>
Gumption, he said, is the key. As other workers told him when they introduced 
him to the day-labor system, "Whatever they tell you they need, you say you 
have experience doing it. When you get to the job, you watch the other workers, 
and you just do it." 
</P>
<P>
He looks at a woman who's driven up to a liquor store and market along Kester, 
takes a hesitant step toward her, gets no response and retreats. "Sometimes 
it's better if you approach them," he said, because employers would be 
embarrassed to beckon someone who turns out not to be offering work. 
</P>
<P>
A woman about 55 years old pulls up in a white Buick. She rolls down her window 
and smiles; the men, including Castro, surround her car. Three jump into the 
back seat. "Just need three," she tells the others. 
</P>
<P>
Although about 10 prospective employers stop for workers on this day, Castro is 
not lucky enough to land a job. He calls it quits about 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
But Castro is not worried. A few weeks ago, a North Hollywood resident who owns 
a refrigeration supply company hired him. Since then, he has been assembling 
refrigeration products and painting the man's house for a few days each week. 
If employers like your work the first time, "sometimes they'll come back and 
look for you," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by a breakup with his fiancee and dreams of seeing "Disneylandia," 
Castro left the fishing village of Sinaloa and crossed into the United States 
in May, 1986. In Mexico, he was training to work for a fishing cooperative and 
lived with his fisherman father, mother and six siblings in a four-bedroom 
house. 
</P>
<P>
He took a bus to Tijuana, where a coyote led him and three other men across the 
border to San Ysidro about 3 a.m. He and the others hid from the searchlights 
of U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service helicopters as they made their 
way north. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men had a friend in Panorama City, who let Castro stay at her home 
and invited him to help her sell marijuana. Castro said he did not know about 
day-labor opportunities and had looked for work, but employers kept demanding 
documentation. He said he finally agreed to peddle marijuana on Blythe Street. 
He made $200 to $500 a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent Money Home 
</P>
<P>
He sent money home, telling his parents that he worked in a restaurant -- and 
feeling guilty about the lie. In the summer of 1987, he was arrested by Los 
Angeles police, who found 6.2 grams of marijuana in his possession. Out on 
$5,000 bail, he returned to Mexico with a duffel bag of dresses, Reebok shoes 
and toys for his brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
In his village, though, he yearned to return to the United States. Los Angeles 
"is more of a rat race, but you can get what you want faster. . . . Right away, 
you can get all the things you need -- TV, apartment." 
</P>
<P>
He tried to cross back to the United States, got caught, tried again and 
succeeded in early 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Still guilt-ridden about lying to his parents, he said he decided to give up 
drug dealing. New friends took him to Victory and Kester. His first day, he got 
a job mixing stucco at a Studio City house. 
</P>
<P>
But in November, police recognized him on Blythe Street and hauled him in. He 
pleaded guilty to his prior felony drug charge, possessing marijuana for sale. 
After serving three months of his sentence, he was released on probation. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction probably blocks any opportunity that Castro might have had to 
live in the United States legally, said Antonio Rodriguez, a lawyer at the 
Latino Community Justice Center in Los Angeles. But even without a criminal 
record, Castro may not have fit into a category that would have made him 
eligible for legal status -- he has no relatives who are permanent residents or 
citizens, is not a farm worker, does not qualify for amnesty and has no 
specialized skill for which there are not enough American workers, Rodriguez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Castro said he paid $300 to someone he knows as "an attorney," who told him 
it would take five months to obtain citizenship. The man told The Times that he 
was not an attorney but worked for one and refused to give more information. 
His phone has since been disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prospects Dim 
</P>
<P>
Castro did not seem worried that his prospects for citizenship are dim. He said 
he has paid for his crime and plans to continue going to Las Piedras to seek 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The going rate along the street is $5 an hour, and Castro said he will work for 
less. But he and other workers said men who haven't worked in a few days are 
desperate and will take whatever they can get. 
</P>
<P>
One homeowner, Castro said, wanted two men to clear away the torn-down walls in 
a Ventura Boulevard house that was being remodeled. Once at the house, the 
homeowner said he would pay each man $20 for an 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. workday. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine that? Two dollars an hour," Castro said. The employer refused 
to pay more, drove them back to Kester Avenue in Van Nuys and picked up others, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Unpaid 
</P>
<P>
Castro said he was once cheated on an asphalt repair job. The foreman said the 
boss would pay, but he never did. Castro said he is owed about $50. But, he 
said, taking the time to pursue the lost wages would mean a day away from the 
street and potential loss of more wages. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not working or looking for work, Castro visits friends, strolls the 
Panorama City Mall or along Broadway downtown, or watches TV at home -- a 
$475-a-month studio apartment in Van Nuys that he shares with an older man 
nicknamed "Tio" (uncle) and two teen-age boys. Castro said the teen-age 
brothers arrived from Ensenada two weeks ago and one of them -- using false 
papers -- recently landed a job. Castro and Tio have been splitting the rent.

Acclaimed concert violinist Eugene Fodor was jailed Saturday on drug, weapons 
and burglary charges after a break-in at a Martha's Vineyard motel, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were summoned to the Vineyard Harbor Motel after a chambermaid found 
Fodor in a room that was listed as unoccupied and notified the manager, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Fodor, 39, was carrying 20 grams of cocaine, a small amount of heroin, a 
dagger, a hypodermic needle and some pills when he was arrested Friday, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fodor was being held at the Duke's County Jail in Edgartown in lieu of $50,000 
cash bail after a district judge refused to accept his 300-year-old violin as 
surety. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked among the top classical violin soloists, Fodor rose to prominence in 
1974 when he became the first American to share honors in the prestigious 
Tchaikovsky Violin Competition in Moscow.

BACKWARD STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One small step backward for man, one giant step backward for mankind is the way 
the port commissioners' vote for naming the new convention center can be 
interpreted ("Port Rejects King's Name on S.D. Center," July 26). Ironically, 
it happened the week after we have celebrated the 20th anniversary of the walk 
on the moon, the big step forward for mankind. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Milford Portwood, Raymond Burk, Robert Penner and Daniel Larsen oppose 
the renaming? After all, the democratic process was followed with Rev. Clyde 
Gaines leading a citizens' committee for 10 months that came up with that 
recommendation. How does Larsen justify his stand? Did he capitulate to the 
good old boys? Is he that insensitive to followers of Dr. Martin Luther King, 
to the children who seek a role model, a distinguished black man, a reminder of 
what we can become? 
</P>
<P>
The distinguished Dr. Martin Luther King will not suffer for the loss. He's 
been inscribed in history as the symbol of non-violence, a man of fairness. Who 
will suffer? San Diegans will miss the opportunity of being reminded of what 
Dr. King did in his short time here. The generic convention center won't have 
Dr. King's name. It's a missed opportunity to promote non-violence in an age of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
When we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Apollo in July of 1999, we will 
also recall the 10th anniversary of the name-change vote, a bad day in San 
Diego's history where four men took a terrible step backward.

WHAT PRICE HONOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the overall scheme of things, the name of a convention center is not worth 
much. But honoring one's word is -- something that San Diego Unified Port 
District Commissioner Daniel Larsen seemed to forget when he voted to reject 
the City Council's request to name the new convention center for the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr. With his vote, Larsen reneged on a public promise he had 
made to support the tribute. 
</P>
<P>
Now, for many San Diegans, the center meant to be a symbol of civic pride will 
be a symbol of racial prejudice, a bitter reminder that their hometown will 
rally harder against a black hero than for one. 
</P>
<P>
That happened when the City Council named Market Street for the slain 
civil-rights leader and opponents gathered 79,175 signatures to ask the voters 
to overrule the council. It happened again after the Market Street vote, when a 
citizens' advisory panel went out into the community to solicit input for a new 
tribute and was mostly greeted with apathy. Even the private-tribute committee 
formed by the Chamber of Commerce has had difficulty rallying enough financial 
support for its plan for scholarships and a statue to King. It has been able to 
raise only $150,000 of its $750,000 goal. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of naming the convention center for the Nobel Peace Prize winner 
had no difficulty gathering support for their cause. Larsen said he had an 
avalanche of letters and calls in favor of keeping the generic name, San Diego 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
One has to wonder what kind of reaction there will be to state Sen. Pete 
Chacon's proposal to name a portion of California 94 through Southeast San 
Diego for King. In a city where freeways are known more by numbers than names, 
such a tribute is fairly bland. 
</P>
<P>
But the prospect of the City Council proposing anything much more significant 
than that right now seems too much to expect. For that would require an unusual 
display of political will, and, if one thing has become clear, it is that San 
Diego's leaders don't share the indomitable spirit of artist Eddie Edwards, who 
is painting a two-story mural of King at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary 
School as part of the school arts program funded by Muriel Gluck. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a lot of heroes in the community," Edwards said recently, "but 
if people don't give you your monuments and statues, you have to make your 
own."

TAMING KILLER BEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seldom can one point to a specific point in time when the use of words, ink and 
paper will save lives, which is the case of your reporting of the San Diego 
Africanized honey bee (AHB) symposium. Hollywood has promoted the image of the 
AHB as a giant bee that goes out of its way to attack people, when in reality 
it is only a subspecies of the domestic bee that is much more defensive of its 
hive. This is not to say we can ignore it; the community needs to be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Your accurate reporting of the scientific aspects about the AHB ("Conferees 
Discuss 'Killer' Bee Quarantine Sites and Emergency Services," June 16) has 
replaced public fears with facts that will allow them to protect themselves and 
disrupt their lives to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
We plan to organize a task force this fall, which will prepare an action plan 
for the community. Such a plan limited the number of deaths in Mexico to five 
over a three-year period, as compared to more than 300 during a similar period 
in Venezuela.

A SUPERIOR ALTERNATIVE TO SECONDARY TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB FILNER, Bob Filner is the San Diego City Council member from District 8. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a devout environmentalist, I was continually dismayed during the 1980s as I 
watched the City Council drag its feet rather than move decisively to upgrade 
our sewage system to secondary treatment. Secondary was the law; secondary was 
good for the environment; secondary meant a cleaner ocean. 
</P>
<P>
In typical fashion, the anti-environmental forces argued that it made little 
"economic" or "fiscal" sense to take the necessary steps to protect our 
environment. And I applauded the decision of the City Council in 1987 (before I 
was a member) to fully commit itself to this "environmental" position. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in 1989, I have joined my colleague, Councilman Bruce Henderson, to lead 
the fight against a total upgrade of our sewage system to secondary treatment. 
Why did I change what was previously, for me, a sacred position? 
</P>
<P>
A major consideration was the testimony of the highly respected scientists from 
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. They concluded that moving from 
advanced primary to secondary treatment (that is, from a system that removes 
75% of the suspended solids from sewage to one that removes 85% to 90%) would 
have virtually no positive impact on our ocean's ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Put another way, the incredible costs for a small incremental increase in the 
purity of sewage water dumped into the ocean could not be justified by any 
measurable environmental gain. 
</P>
<P>
I have yet to hear any credible technical rebuttal to this position. In fact, 
just last week, the same concerns were echoed by scientific voices from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Water Sciences and Technology 
Board of the National Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
As persuasive as this scientific testimony might be, an even more important 
element in my conversion was the recognition of the critical necessity of water 
reclamation for San Diego's future. That is the new factor in the environmental 
equation. 
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely vital -- for our environment, for our pocketbooks, for our 
very quality of life in San Diego -- that we move rapidly to reclaim as much 
water as possible from our sewage. Reclaimed water is fully satisfactory for 
such uses as agriculture and irrigation of lawns and golf courses, and in many 
industrial plants. 
</P>
<P>
All of my colleagues on the City Council recognize this -- and have ensured 
that planning for water reclamation will occupy a central place in the overall 
sewage treatment policy. 
</P>
<P>
But here's the rub: We may not be able to afford both water reclamation and a 
full secondary system. And, if the federal law is not changed -- and we are 
forced to go to secondary -- what will be dropped due to fiscal constraints? 
Water reclamation! 
</P>
<P>
We cannot allow that to happen. A decentralized system of six to 10 water 
reclamation plants, in upstream locations around the county, would allow us to 
reclaim about half of our sewage for usable water. And water reclamation, let 
me point out, requires going beyond secondary, to tertiary treatment. So about 
half of the metropolitan system's sewage would be treated to a level where more 
than 99% of the solids are removed, and the remaining half would receive 
advanced primary treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Without the necessity of converting the Point Loma treatment plant to secondary 
and building two other plants, such a system would cost about $1.6 billion to 
build. That's more than $1 billion less than our current plans call for. 
</P>
<P>
But such an environmentally sound, cost-effective and common-sense system is 
precluded by federal law. That is why Henderson and I are leading a bipartisan 
effort with our congressional delegation to pursue an alternative course. 
</P>
<P>
If our sewer rates are to be kept within reasonable bounds, if we are to have 
enough water at a reasonable cost, if we really want to protect our 
environment, we must succeed in changing the law. Secondary should not be our 
primary aim; water reclamation should.

SPECULATOR STASHES CARTOON WAREHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Millions of Saturday morning television cartoon images -- super heroes, 
extraterrestrials, talking animals and characters from traditional folk tales 
-- are tightly packed into numbered cardboard boxes in a nondescript Woodland 
Hills warehouse next to a railroad track. 
</P>
<P>
One-dimensional, brightly colored paintings on acetate, they depict such 
well-known characters as the Lone Ranger, Lassie, Tarzan, Pinocchio and Flash 
Gordon, as well as characters familiar only to cartoon-addicted children. For 
much of the 80-year history of animation, such paintings -- known as cels, 
because in the early days of animation they were done on celluloid -- have been 
considered valueless scrap, mere raw material from which animated films were 
made. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Take Over Storage 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Filmation Associates, the Woodland Hills animation company that 
created many of these cels, was on the verge of destroying them last year when 
Herman Rush came along. Rush, a former top television marketing executive, 
agreed to take over storage of the cels, and his company offered to pay 
Filmation a royalty in return for the right to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Animated Art of Burbank, owned by Rush and a partner, has acquired rights 
from other studios as well. It can market nearly 7 million cels -- which are 
stored in warehouses in Japan and Korea, in addition to Woodland Hills -- and 
controls what he said is the world's largest inventory of animated art. 
</P>
<P>
Royal's main competitor as a large independent distributor of animation art is 
Linda Jones, daughter of Chuck Jones, who helped develop such Warner Bros. 
cartoon characters as Bugs Bunny and Wile E. Coyote. Royal is the sole 
legitimate source of cels from 43 television series and animated movies 
depicting 132 principal characters. Although others may possess cels from those 
series, only Royal has acquired the legal right to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
The original cost of creating the cels, according to Rush, was nearly $200 
million. The resale value of even the fraction of the cels considered 
marketable, he is hoping, could be that much or more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wall Decoration? 
</P>
<P>
But whether Rush can find a large enough market for his holdings is a matter of 
sharp debate. Clearly, to be successful, Rush must reach far beyond the small 
circle of serious collectors and speculators. Dealers and galleries 
specializing in animated art are divided on whether a sufficient number of 
buyers will be willing to pay hundreds of dollars for art that may become 
decoration for their children's walls rather than a good investment. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is a multimillion-dollar market here, but I have to find a 
route out to the marketplace," said Rush, former president of Coca-Cola 
Television. To do that, he is targeting large galleries but also selling to 
gift stores and hobby shops, two outlets heretofore untried for animation art. 
Recently he also arranged for dealers to sell his cels in the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Early, rare animated art, mostly from Walt Disney Co., is unquestionably 
soaring in value, doubling in price every six months for the past two years. 
But the value of recent animation cels, particularly from cartoons featuring 
less well-known characters, remains largely untested. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a mass market for art today in the U.S., if not the world, 
and I think animated art falls into that category," Rush said. "Time will tell 
if I'm right." 
</P>
<P>
But Stuart Reisbord of Wallingford, Pa., one of the nation's largest and most 
respected collectors and dealers of animated art, is skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much harder to sell to the masses," he said of Rush's strategy. "It's 
much harder to sell something for $200 to $300 than it is to sell something for 
$20,000 to $30,000." 
</P>
<P>
Reisbord said buyers with less money to spend would rather purchase cels from 
recent Disney movies and cartoons than cels from a less well-known company such 
as Filmation. In fact, he said, his gallery has virtually stopped selling 
Filmation cels. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an awful lot of that art around and . . . the vast quantities might 
make it harder to sell," Reisbord said. "Everything will depend on the price 
he's going to ask." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Record Purchase 
</P>
<P>
The top price ever paid for a piece of animated art soared in May to $286,000 
for a black-and-white cel from a 1934 Disney film, "The Orphan's Benefit," at 
Christie's East auction house in New York. That price was five times the record 
set a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
But the price of a cel from a broad range of cartoons -- such as "The 
Flintstones," "The Jetsons," "Yogi Bear" and most Warner Bros. cartoons -- is 
increasing rapidly as well, although it still is less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Kleiman, a Studio City dealer credited with helping establish a West 
Coast market for animation art, said all cels will eventually go up in value. 
But how fast and how much is unknown. "When this stupid market started, Hanna 
Barbera cels were going for a dollar or two," he said, referring to the famous 
producer of such shows as "The Flintstones." "Now they are $100 or $150. The 
only problem is that a new cel is going to cost $100 or $150, and where is it 
going to go from there?" 
</P>
<P>
Kleiman said many of the characters represented by Rush -- including the 
Archies, Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, Ghostbusters and others -- are 
overpriced, given present demand. Others agreed, but said that demand -- and 
the cels' value -- may eventually increase dramatically, especially if the 
number of collectors continues to build and the present supply of older cels is 
snapped up. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, publicity about the high prices brought by a few cels -- including a 
selection of 560 from the 1988 "Adventures of Roger Rabbit" auctioned in June 
for $1.6 million, nearly twice pre-sale expectations -- is drawing new 
enthusiasts to the art form. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Gold Mine' 
</P>
<P>
The June sale of Roger Rabbit cels amazed some collectors. Jerry Muller, a 
longtime collector based in Costa Mesa, said: "That was one film's cels that 
were cranked out a year or two ago, and not all of the cels were the best. If 
that is any indication of where the market for recent animation art is going, 
then Herman is sitting on a gold mine." 
</P>
<P>
The circulation of Animation Magazine, a 1-year-old Los Angeles publication 
that covers the animation art market, already has reached 20,000 and is 
increasing rapidly, editors said. Christie's recently became the first art 
auction house to establish an animation art department, and four auctions of 
cartoon cels are planned for this year. Christie's top animation art buyer will 
be in Los Angeles for a week in August to appraise older cels. 
</P>
<P>
The higher prices are drawing valuable cels out of storage in basements and 
garages. Several dealers said former animators frequently have large caches of 
their work, with or without a studio's permission. "A lot of the time, these 
cels were going to be thrown away," said Arnold Kowan, a dealer who works out 
of his home in Van Nuys. "I try to find these people." 
</P>
<P>
Kowan said he tries to be sure that people from whom he buys cels actually own 
then. But he and a number of dealers across the country failed to detect that 
numerous cels they purchased last year and this year probably had been stolen 
from a Warner Bros. warehouse in Toluca Lake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anonymous Tip 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous letter received by the Burbank Police Department in April, 1988, 
tipped off Warner Bros. that several boxes of cels and drawings may have been 
taken from the warehouse. A studio investigation discovered that cels worth an 
estimated $275,000 had disappeared. Disney officials believe that cels worth 
$200,000 were taken from a warehouse in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
In February, FBI agents and Burbank police raided galleries and dealers' homes 
in Los Angeles, Studio City and Van Nuys -- including Kowan's -- and seized 
hundreds of cels featuring such characters as Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn, 
Porky Pig and even a few forged cels of Disney's Roger Rabbit. Cels were also 
seized from collectors in Virginia and were believed to have been sold in 
Boston, New York, Atlanta, Guam and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities are investigating whether at least one San Fernando Valley 
dealer engaged in interstate commerce in stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Determining who owns cels is but one hurdle facing the novice collector. Cels 
are easily faked, dealers said. And even legitimate production cels -- those 
actually used to make an animated film -- may be worthless if they only contain 
partial images. 
</P>
<P>
Because Rush deals almost solely in recent cels obtained from their producers, 
he is able to certify to purchasers that he has the legal right to sell them. 
That approach, Rush believes, legitimizes a market that has thrived on 
underground sources of cels slipped out of studios surreptitiously. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guarantees Downplayed 
</P>
<P>
Several dealers said serious collectors do not need such assurances. They know 
whether older cels are legitimate. And they usually do not fear that a studio 
will try to reclaim ownership of cels taken by animators or given or thrown 
away by studios many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Recent cels, however, have been much more closely guarded. And, dealers said, 
that is where Rush's completely aboveboard approach is already paying 
dividends. 
</P>
<P>
According to several dealers, Rush's aggressive enforcement of his legal rights 
to be the sole source of cels depicting certain characters is having an impact 
on the market. Kowan said he stopped selling cels from DIC Enterprises, a large 
studio based in Burbank that markets its cels through Rush, after receiving a 
letter from Rush threatening to sue him. Others agreed that Rush has also 
succeeded in becoming the sole source of Filmation cels. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm all for what Herman is doing and ultimately the market . . . will have to 
be 100% legitimate," Muller said. "But there are always going to be gray areas 
because most of this stuff has never been officially released." 
</P>
<P>
To distinguish his company from speculators and underground dealers, Rush said 
he will not offer cels to galleries that market cels from unofficial sources. 
But Kleiman, the Studio City dealer, was scornful. "He should be promoting the 
cels on their . . . quality, rather than trying to scare people with the 
certificates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, said Leonard Surico, a downtown Los Angeles dealer, the underground 
sources of cels are going to dry up. And when they do, Rush will be in a good 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what Herman is doing is the future," Surico said. "It's a good 
business move, if he can hold on long enough."

EXPERTS CITE PRECEDENT, RISK IN PARITY PAY SCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the world of municipal labor negotiations, tying a police force's wages to 
those of other departments is commonplace, although experts agree that it can 
be risky business for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
For unions, "in the future, they could be locking themselves into something," 
said Michael Scott, a research associate at the Police Executive Research Forum 
in Washington. "It's a gamble they take." 
</P>
<P>
For cities, warned Richard (Bud) Carpenter of the League of California Cities, 
there is the specter of losing control. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect you're then taking it out of the hands of the city council to fix 
their own salaries," said Carpenter, the league's employee relations counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley Police Officers Assn. just won a four-year contract that, if 
ratified by the City Council, will grant wage parity with other police forces 
for the first time in the department's 18-year history. Under the agreement, 
scheduled for approval Monday by the City Council, the city will conduct a 
salary survey of 12 Southern California police forces and pay Simi Valley 
officers the average. 
</P>
<P>
Although the survey won't be conducted until the contract's last year -- a 
controversial concession by the union -- police spokesmen said the wage formula 
is a coup nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"Granted, it doesn't happen until the fourth year, but at least it happens," 
said Sgt. Gary Collins, the union's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly is a positive recognition by the city that Simi Valley is not an 
island separate and apart from the rest of Southern California," said union 
attorney Stephen Silver. 
</P>
<P>
While Scott generally agreed that higher wages will attract more applicants and 
raise the caliber of Simi Valley's force, he also warned that average salaries 
over the long term could leave Simi Valley in the middle of the pack and soften 
any competitive edge that it might gain in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter said that while salary surveys have been used for the last 30 years 
to varying degrees, they snare cities into cycles of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But Nathaniel Trives, a criminal justice professor at Cal State Los Angeles and 
a former police officer and mayor of Santa Monica, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the notion that the cities selected will all inflate their salaries 
and then Simi Valley will have to inflate its salaries is not likely because 
city managers and councils discuss these things at conventions," Trives said. 
"It's not an isolated world." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greatest Hurdles 
</P>
<P>
The biggest hurdles during Simi Valley's negotiations were agreeing on a list 
of which departments will be surveyed, and then whether the union should 
receive a full average or merely a percentage of the average salary, said 
spokesmen for both sides. Disagreement over those issues was profound enough to 
cause a three-week deadlock and subsequently prompt about 200 police supporters 
to pack a City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody picked cities without looking at salaries first," Simi 
Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
Talks resumed after the pivotal council meeting, and the city ultimately agreed 
to pay a full average if the wage formula could be held off until the 
contract's last year. 
</P>
<P>
The police forces to be surveyed include Burbank, Santa Monica, Oxnard, Orange 
and the sheriff's departments in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Simi Valley 
officers are now paid the least among that group, but they will receive a 7.5% 
raise in the contract's first year, Silver said. The base salary for patrolmen, 
the lowest-ranking officers, is $26,472 a year. 
</P>
<P>
And while the two sides will return to the bargaining table just a year after 
the salary survey is finally conducted, Silver and Stratton said they believed 
that a precedent had been set. LESLIE BERGER

10% INCREASE IN REFUSE HAULER'S FEE IS APPROVED IN HAWTHORNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an attempt to help resolve a $2.5-million budget deficit, the Hawthorne City 
Council has approved a plan to raise the city refuse contractor's franchise fee 
10%, with the cost to be passed on to city residents and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The council differed sharply over the plan last week, and finally voted 3 to 1 
to increase the fee for one year. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Betty J. Ainsworth, Councilman Charles Bookhammer and Councilman Steven 
Andersen supported the revenue-raising measure, while Councilwoman Ginny M. 
Lambert blasted the plan as a thinly disguised tax imposed without the 
necessary voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially this city is disenfranchised," Lambert contended, noting that the 
fee increase was handled without a public hearing even though residents will 
end up footing the bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Represented by Council 
</P>
<P>
Andersen bristled at Lambert's comment and called it "a flat misstatement." He 
said the public is represented by its elected City Council: "They have the vote 
of the people who sit up here. That is their voice. We can be removed if we are 
not their voice." 
</P>
<P>
The increased fee, effective retroactively to July 1, will raise the city's 
revenue by $550,000, helping to offset its $2.5-million deficit for 1989-90, 
City Manager R. Kenneth Jue said in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The increase will raise the average household's monthly refuse bill to $10.45 
from the current $9.40, placing it "right in the ballpark" for refuse fees in 
neighboring cities, Jue said. 
</P>
<P>
Jue said the city is searching for ways to provide additional funds to replace 
two sources of revenue -- paramedic fees and sales taxes -- that have fallen 
short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
If revenues are not increased, the city may have to lay off as many as 32 
employees and close one fire station to balance the $44.8-million budget, Jue 
said. A budget hearing is scheduled Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's council meeting, Lambert attacked the franchise fee increase, 
saying that it amounted to a new tax that, by law, should have been subject to 
a citywide vote. Proposition 62, a ballot measure enacted by state voters in 
November, 1986, bars cities from enacting new taxes without voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
Lambert pressed for a delay on the council vote, saying that the issue was 
handled hurriedly, without proper public notice. City officials said the issue 
needed to be resolved quickly to meet a Los Angeles County deadline for 
information to be included on county property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase Passed On 
</P>
<P>
She noted that the item on Monday's council agenda made no mention that the 
increased franchise fee would be passed on to city residents and businesses. 
Lambert said that the language of the measure should be changed to spell out 
that the increase will be passed along. 
</P>
<P>
Under close questioning by Lambert, City Atty. Michael Adamson said that the 
city has to word the measure carefully. The city has a binding contract with H 
&amp; C Disposal Co. that cannot be changed without the consent of the 
contractor. H &amp; C would be unlikely to agree to the 10% increase unless it 
could be passed through to customers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he made it clear that the city does not want to word the measure so that 
it becomes a tax subject to voter approval. "If you impose the fee on citizens 
directly, you probably have a contract violation. And you also have a tax," 
said Adamson. 
</P>
<P>
"That's exactly my point," retorted Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversy Not New 
</P>
<P>
Controversy over the city's refuse collection system is not new. In 1984-85, 
the Los Angeles County Grand Jury conducted an investigation of Hawthorne city 
government and recommended that the city seek bids on the contract. H &amp; C 
has hauled the city's trash since 1957, and the city has never sought 
competitive bids. 
</P>
<P>
In March, without competitive bids, the City Council voted 3-2 to give H &amp; 
C a five-year extension on its contract. Andersen, who voted for the added five 
years, said the company has earned the extension because of its good service. 
</P>
<P>
But Lambert, who voted with Ainsworth against the extension, questioned the 
long-term contract and the recent extension. "I don't think we have done right 
by our constituents," she said at the time.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: THE MYSTERIES OF MADRONA MARSH ARE REVEALED TO TORRANCE 
SCHOOL TEACHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The sun was just burning through the clouds when a group of about 40 teachers 
from elementary and middle schools throughout Torrance -- wearing shorts, 
T-shirts, blue jeans, sneakers and climbing boots -- gathered across the street 
from Madrona Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
They were met that Thursday morning by Walton Wright, the city's naturalist, 
who would lead them on a field trip of the city's 43-acre seasonal wetland. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers, many of whom carried binoculars and pencil and paper, were there 
to learn enough about the marsh's wildlife and vegetation so that they can show 
other teachers how to lead their students on similar field trips. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after the field trip began, a group of about 10 teachers spotted a 
light brown fox walking beside a fence about 70 yards away. Later, as the group 
entered dense bulrushes and shrubbery, they spotted dozens of tiny green- and 
gold-colored tree frogs hopping around their feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed," Mary Marra, an eighth-grade teacher at Lynn Middle School, said 
as she tried to spot nearby Sepulveda Boulevard over the tules and cattails. 
"You wouldn't know there were about 900 cars going by on Sepulveda." 
</P>
<P>
The field trip is part of a federally funded program to educate teachers about 
science. The teachers volunteered to spend three weeks discussing ecology, 
botany and astronomy and participating in field trips. 
</P>
<P>
The program's $167,480 grant from the United States Department of Education 
will also pay for computers, lasers and a planetarium in a new science center 
at the district's Levy Center. Teachers hope to open the center to Torrance 
students by September. 
</P>
<P>
Among the field trips in the three-week program was a visit to the TRW Inc. 
aerospace research facility in Redondo Beach, said Walteria Elementary School 
teacher Kay Griffith. There teachers saw the Hubble space telescope, which is 
to be sent into space on one of the space shuttle flights. Last week, the group 
toured the Hyperion sewage treatment plant near El Segundo to learn about water 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's trip through Madrona Marsh was intended to give teachers a hands-on 
lesson in ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Rizzo, a third-grade teacher at Arlington Elementary School, said the field 
trip made him feel more confident in his ability to teach children about nature 
and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Jeneice Houze, a fifth-grade teacher at Lincoln Elementary School, said she 
plans to bring students to the marsh this year to teach them about the wildlife 
and the delicate balance of nature there. 
</P>
<P>
At a clearing just east of Madrona Avenue, Wright halted and pointed out 
hundreds of mounds of dirt next to gopher holes in the sandy soil. He said the 
marsh has "the most gophers I've seen anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Later, as the teachers studied the dry brush on the northeast section of the 
marsh, Wright told the group that many people have abandoned domesticated 
rabbits and ducks at the marsh. The animals usually are eaten by foxes, said 
the botanist who seems quite at home among the grass, willows and weeds. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who put (the animals) out in the natural habitat 
thinking it is good for them," he said. "That really doesn't work. They get 
wiped out." 
</P>
<P>
The walk through the marsh was not without its more common diversions. Soon 
after the teachers passed through the rusty chain-link gates to the marsh, the 
conversation among several turned to recipes for zucchini bread, the high price 
of a face lift and the deadly fear of snakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Are there any snakes here," asked a woman in a blue T-shirt and blue jeans as 
she poked through some tule and brush along the side of a path. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are, stay by me," said another teacher, who wore dark glasses. "I 
have the best snake alarm: I just see a snake and I scream. I can get the whole 
Torrance Fire Department here." 
</P>
<P>
When the 2 1/2-hour walk was over, Wright stopped just outside of the gates of 
the marsh. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just like any other class," he said as the teachers began to walk 
back to their cars. "Some could care less about what I said. Some looked bored. 
</P>
<P>
"But the frogs were the big eye-catcher because the frogs are the creepy, 
crawling things they like." Hugo Martin

BORDER PATROL SEIZES MARIJUANA CACHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Border Patrol agents reported seizing 898 pounds of marijuana with an estimated 
street value of $833,000 early Saturday when they stopped a van in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Border Patrol report, agents from the Brown Field Station became 
suspicious about a Dodge van driving northbound on Interstate 805 at 1:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The agents gave chase, and the driver exited westbound at Main Street in Chula 
Vista, where it was stopped. The Border Patrol report said a passenger in the 
van ran away and escaped. However, agents arrested the driver, Rogelio Luna 
Zauza, 26, of Mexico at the scene and seized 22 military duffel bags full of 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second sizable marijuana seizure by Border Patrol agents in the 
last two months. On June 7, agents from the Imperial Beach Station confiscated 
808 pounds of marijuana.

BUYER BEWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the California Department of Insurance advise consumers to take 
several precautions when buying and maintaining insurance policies: 
</P>
<P>
* Determine whether the salesperson is an agent or a broker. Insurance agents 
are the representatives of the companies whose policies they sell. Insurance 
companies are obligated to honor the promises of their agents if a client can 
document that money was given to the agent in good faith. Brokers are legally 
the customer's representative, and insurance companies are not obligated to 
make good on brokers' claims. However, since they agreed to do business with 
brokers, many companies will honor claims in cases of broker fraud. 
</P>
<P>
* Before giving an agent or broker money for a premium, obtain a written binder 
naming the insurance company. this serves as temporary proof of insurance until 
receipt of an official policy. Receipts for any money given to a broker for an 
insurance premium should also be obtained. 
</P>
<P>
* Insist on an official policy from the insurance company within 30 days after 
a deposit. If a policy is not received, the broker or agent should be contacted 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
* If there are doubts about coverage, contact the insurance company directly. 
Most insurance companies have a customer-service division that can verify 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
* If a cancellation notice is received, for any reason, contact the broker or 
agent and ask whether coverage is still valid. If the representative says it 
is, written proof should be obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Again, doubts can be resolved by contacting the insurance company directly. 
</P>
<P>
* If a company advises that insurance coverage has been canceled, demand a 
refund from the broker or agent and notify state authorities at the Los Angeles 
investigations bureau of the state Department of Insurance, (213) 736-2560. 
</P>
<P>
* To resolve any doubts, ask the Department of Insurance about the reputation 
of a broker or agent before beginning business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
The department can confirm whether a representative is licensed, which 
insurance companies have agreed to sell policies through that person, and how 
long he or she has been in business. The state can also advise consumers if 
disciplinary action has been taken. The number of the licensing division is 
(916) 322-3555.

DANNEMEYER ON HOMOSEXUALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, another flap and more oppression as Rep. William E. Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton) is at it again: Rather than striving for progress, growth, and 
social relevance, he continues to incite and feed the flames of racism and 
widespread prejudice against "the homosexual movement." 
</P>
<P>
I think Dannemeyer's tactics are despicable and contemptuous of the system of 
democracy that he infests. Dannemeyer is really out on a limb, however, this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer has no business airing that kind of discussion in our Congressional 
Record. We don't have straight congressmen describing heterosexual sex for the 
sake of straw issues. There is no reason to further cloud and bias the issues 
by Dannemeyer's feeding into ignorance in such a forum and in such a 
self-serving and self-righteous manner. 
</P>
<P>
I am outraged at Dannemeyer's actions because he continues to abuse and tax the 
ideals of Democracy with his perverted and twisted ideas of what constitute 
morality, fairness and human compassion. 
</P>
<P>
I strongly support the legislative efforts of my progressive and clear-thinking 
elected officials in their affirmative efforts to pass the legislation to 
guarantee my fellow gay men and women the same anti-discriminatory protections 
afforded racial minorities in the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

THOSE WHO LACK HEALTH COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How bad does it have to become before we have a national health plan? After 
reading two stories you ran on July 16, I was absolutely outraged. 
</P>
<P>
The first article concerned the parents of Jonathan Weston, 23 months old, who 
along with two other toddlers wandered into a back yard swimming pool in 
Tustin. One child died, and Jonathan and the other child sustained severe brain 
damage. The parents had to have a yard sale because, even though they have 
health insurance, the catastrophic part of the policy covers them to $1 million 
and the $1 million will be used up within the year. No family should have to 
have that worry -- they have enough stress just coping with having a child who 
will have to receive care for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Story No. 2 (Commentary) concerned Juan Antonio Jimenez of Orange County, who 
was struck by a car in Brawley. The hospital where he was taken could not care 
for him properly, but because he had no insurance, nine other hospitals that 
were contacted said they were unable to take him. His suffering lasted 20 days, 
and his family had to bury him after he died of gangrene. Can you imagine? In 
this day and age, a man died of gangrene. This is treatable. This is a sin 
against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
What good is all our medical technology if it isn't available to all of our 
people? I can't fathom why, with all the brains in our country, we can't glean 
from the other Western industrialized nations who have had national health 
plans in place for many years the best of them all and apply it to our own. 
</P>
<P>
I am employed in a hospital. I don't expect coverage to be free; I know what 
tremendous costs we are talking about. Good health is not a privilege; it is a 
right -- especially in a country that at the first opportunity praises itself 
for its achievements in the high-tech health field. What good is it to have the 
finest if it isn't available except to the special few?

FLOOD-PROTECTION MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It will still take years before residents along the Santa Ana River can breathe 
easier, but after more than two decades of effort, the way was finally cleared 
in Washington last Thursday to begin building more critically needed flood 
control protection into the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
The project should have been approved and funded years ago, considering that 
the Santa Ana River, which runs from Big Bear Lake to the Pacific Ocean, has 
been tagged by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as the worst potential flood threat 
in the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
And it will stay that way, flirting with flood dangers and Mother Nature, until 
the work building a new dam in San Bernardino County, raising the level of the 
Prado Dam in Riverside County and widening and deepening the river channel in 
Orange County is well under way. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Army engineers estimated that a major flood could put parts 
of 10 low-lying county cities under water. As many as 3,000 lives could be lost 
and damage could exceed $14 billion. That is too big a potential disaster to 
flirt with for so long. 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough finally came in the U.S. Senate's approval of an $18.4 billion 
energy and water bill that contained $20 million in start-up funds for the 
estimated $1.4 billion flood-protection project. The White House said the 
President would sign the bill as soon as it clears a conference committee, 
where the Santa Ana River allocation, approved by both houses, is expected to 
remain untouched. Work on the river should then start next spring. It should be 
given top priority and be completed as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The sun-parched, dirt-dry river looks harmless enough now. But it has breached 
its banks before in recent years and will most certainly again, engineers say, 
without the new protections. Extensive development that has produced more rain 
runoff water has increased the threat in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
It has always been a race against time. The approval of the river plan finally 
gives residents a fighting chance to escape the flood danger.

My deepest gratitude to the good Samaritan, who, early July 11th, observed my 
plight when I broke my ankle at the entrance to Crown Valley Community Park. 
Thanks to your prompt action in calling the paramedics, I had help within 12 
minutes of my fall.

A 25% SALARY INCREASE FOR COUNTY SUPERVISORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In November, I will be asked to approve the half-cent sales tax increase to 
fund highway improvements that we now know means the addition of new diamond 
lanes. It will "only" cost me $75 a year. In June, 1990, I will be asked to 
approve another half-cent sales tax increase to build new jails. Again, it will 
"only" cost me $75 a year. 
</P>
<P>
This is great coming from a Board of Supervisors that voted itself 
(supervisors) a 25% salary increase. 
</P>
<P>
One final thought: Why is it that politicians only know how to do two things -- 
raise taxes and raise their own salaries?

I certainly have to question the leadership capabilities of the Costa Mesa City

METHODS OF TEACHING NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Please, give succor to my thoroughly perplexed brain! On July 17, "O.C. 
Districts Search for Bilingual Teachers" described the extensive measures of 
school districts to find and hire Spanish-speaking teachers. Administrators are 
finding teachers from as far away as South America and the Midwest and 
attempting to entice them to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Then, a different article on the concluding page ("Schoolchildren Are Immersed 
in English") described how Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian children are being 
taught in English -- and succeeding! The second article even went so far as to 
state that "many of the Latino children tend to speak to each other in Spanish 
while the Asian children speak English among themselves as often as their 
native language." I wonder whether maybe the Asian students speak more English 
because they have been instructed in English. 
</P>
<P>
Why is the state forcing school districts to spend thousands of dollars and 
hours to dig up Spanish-speaking teachers when Asian students have demonstrated 
that non-English speaking students can learn English and then learn in English? 
Why not put Latino children in English immersion classrooms and offer them this 
equal shot at success instead of trying to draft anyone who can walk and speak 
Spanish to teach them? Why not search instead for teachers who understand 
second-language acquisition who can effectively teach children to understand 
and speak English well? 
</P>
<P>
The placement of Latino students in bilingual classrooms while Asian students 
are assigned to immersion programs amounts to racial segregation. What social 
problems are developing from this dual track system? 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, bilingual education has its merits: What better way to 
prevent Latino achievement than by denying the means to educational success?

OZONE DEPLETION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a veteran of 27 years in the aerosol industry, I most strenuously object to 
the biased and unfair characterization that appeared July 16 (Letters). 
</P>
<P>
Appearing above a reader's letter dealing with the city of Irvine's passing an 
ordinance restricting the use of chlorofluorocarbons because of their 
relationship to ozone depletion was a large picture of an aerosol can being 
sprayed. The letter itself said nothing about aerosols, yet you saw fit to 
include a picture. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-eight percent of the aerosol products sold in the United States do not 
contain chlorofluorocarbons and have not for more than 10 years, yet you 
ignored these facts along with placing a misleading editorial cartoon that had 
nothing to do with the letter itself. 
</P>
<P>
The only inference a reader could logically draw is that aerosols are harming 
the environment because they contain CFCs. How about getting the facts straight 
before you try and convict a responsible industry? Better yet, how about an 
apology to the aerosol industry for your editorial error?

REPLICA OF DAVID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "David's New Resting Place" (Calendar, July 15): As an alumnus of California 
State University, Fullerton, I was dismayed to see the replica of the statue of 
David in his "final resting place." 
</P>
<P>
The sight of David in pieces on the lawn offends my sense of classic art. Prof. 
Don Lagerberg's opinion that the broken statue is an image that belongs to 
everyone is a bit presumptuous. I, for one, do not identify with it except in a 
negative way. I am appalled at the lack of respect shown to this great work of 
art. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, with Mickey Mouse ideas like those expressed by Lagerberg, it is 
no wonder that CSUF is frequently referred to as Cal State Disneyland.

ROD STEWART A NO-SHOW AT CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Rod Stewart concert was canceled for the second night in a row Saturday when 
the rock star failed to appear for an 8 p.m. performance at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The show was produced by Bill Silva Presents, but concert promoters and Sports 
Arena officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Reason Given for Absence 
</P>
<P>
A man who answered the phone Saturday night at the Sports Arena administrative 
offices said there was no reason given for Stewart's no-show. The worker, who 
asked not to be identified, said the thousands of fans were notified at 8 p.m., 
when the show was scheduled to start, about Stewart's absence. More than an 
hour later, he added, most of the crowd was still in the arena, "kind of angry, 
kind of mad." 
</P>
<P>
"They're just sitting down. They don't want to go home. There's a whole bunch 
of them mad and a lot of police around here. The stage crew is carrying out all 
of his equipment right now." 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said extra police were sent to the arena but no major 
incidents were reported at 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of his fans are older. We don't anticipate any problems," the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was scheduled to perform Friday night, but the concert was canceled 
earlier in the day when his staff reported that a truck carrying the singer's 
equipment from his last concert in Fresno had broken down. 
</P>
<P>
There was no official word on whether the concert would be rescheduled. 
However, the man who answered the phone at the Sports Arena office said that 
fans were told that Stewart would perform on Tuesday night.

A San Fernando youth was wounded early Saturday in a gang-related shooting,

San Fernando Police Sgt. Kenneth Belben said the injured teen-ager was among 
several youths standing in the 400 block of North Maclay Avenue shortly after 
midnight when a truck carrying other youths drove by and stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Belben said the youths in the truck got out and fired several shotgun and 
handgun shots into the group. The attackers got back into the truck and drove 
away, he said.

SCHULZE GETS A GOOD START WITH PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just the other day, Padre Manager Jack McKeon was musing about his latest 
trade, actually hoping, he said, that pitcher Walt Terrell would fare well in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
You see, the Yankees still are being ripped apart by the New York tabloids for 
dealing away Jack Clark to the Padres, and now have tried their hand again by 
swapping third baseman Mike Pagliarulo and pitcher Don Schulze for Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
"I want him to do well," McKeon said. "If you have too many one-sided deals, a 
team won't deal with you." 
</P>
<P>
Well, after the Padres' 9-4 victory over the Dodgers Saturday night, pardon the 
Yankees if they wad up McKeon's phone number and throw it away. 
</P>
<P>
It was enough that Pagliarulo was diving all over the infield once again, 
killing any Dodger hopes of rallies. But there on the mound, making just his 
seventh major-league start since the end of the 1986 season, was Schulze. 
</P>
<P>
He was the throw-in, remember. When the trade was almost consummated, McKeon 
coyly said to Yankees, "Oh, by the way, could you guys throw in a pitcher? We 
need someone to take Terrell's spot in the rotation." 
</P>
<P>
No problem, Yankee General Manager Syd Thrift said. We got the perfect guy for 
you. Schulze. 
</P>
<P>
Hee-hee-hee-hee. 
</P>
<P>
Schulze, though just 26, was headed for his 14th team and seventh organization, 
packing his bags for his 13th city, ninth state and fifth big-league club. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder the guy's staying at Hotel 8 around the corner from San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium, making sure not to send his laundry out overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Schulze's biggest claim to fame was an exhibition game played in Davenport, 
Iowa, in 1981. Pitching for Quad Cities in the Chicago Cubs organization, which 
had made him a first-round draft pick the previous year, Schulze hit a home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
He strolled around the bases just like anyone would do, but when he rounded 
third, he was startled to see a guy in a chicken outfit, who then tackled him. 
You know the mascot. The Famous Chicken, who still the San Diego Chicken then. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd giggled, and even the players had to laugh. Only when Schulze lifted 
himself from the ground did they detect that something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Holding his left shoulder in pain, Schulze immediately went to the trainer's 
room and later to the hospital. X-rays revealed a separated shoulder. He went 
on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
He returned three weeks later but never again was the same. The following year, 
in September 1982, Schulze decided to do something about it. He filed a $2 
million damage suit against The Chicken Co., which handles the business affairs 
of Ted Giannoulas. 
</P>
<P>
The suit eventually went to federal court in October 1985, but a Davenport jury 
cleared Giannoulas of any damages. Schulze and his lawyer appealed, and a year 
later, the U.S. 8th Circuit Court upheld the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
That was the extent of Schulze's fame in pro baseball. 
</P>
<P>
That may be changing. 
</P>
<P>
In his first start for the Padres, Schulze (pronounced SCHULZ-ee) allowed just 
two runs in six innings Saturday, winning his first National League game since 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Still refusing to talk about the Famous Chicken incident, Schulze was more than 
happy to discuss his latest outing, in which he allowed seven hits -- all 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a pretty good sinker tonight," he said, "and Benny (Santiago) just went 
with it. I just tried to keep it down and get some ground balls, and you saw 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Schulze, without the slightest hint of nervousness, mowed down the Dodgers in 
the first five innings, allowing four harmless singles. Even when he ran into 
adversity in the fifth, he escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scioscia led off with a single to center. Pitcher John Wetteland, trying 
to move him to second with a sacrifice bunt, fared even better than planned. 
When he dropped the ball in front of Santiago, the catcher elected to go to 
second. But his throw sailed to the right of the base, and everyone was safe. 
</P>
<P>
With the top of the order awaiting and no one out, now surely would be the 
time, the Dodgers thought, to rid themselves of this pest once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Griffin couldn't do it, popping up a bunt into the mitt of Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Not Willie Randolph either, hitting a fly ball to center field. 
</P>
<P>
And when Kal Daniels hit a bouncer back to the mound, there was Schulze 
pounding his fist into his glove in jubilation, running off the mound. 
</P>
<P>
If he was ecstatic with the way he got out of this jam, you can just imagine 
how he felt the bottom of the inning when the Padres scored five runs -- two 
more than their total in the previous 24 innings. 
</P>
<P>
They opened the inning with consecutive singles to center by Chris James, 
Pagliarulo and Santiago, scoring one run. That brought up Schulze, who until 
this game had not batted since Aug. 8, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Schulze surprised his teammates in batting practice by hitting several balls 
into the left-field seats, but when they asked him if he was going to try to 
hit one during the game, Schulze muttered, "They told me not to worry about 
anything else I do up there, but get down those bunts." 
</P>
<P>
Schulze did just as instructed, laying down a bunt to the right side of the 
mound. Wetteland and Eddie Murray ran toward the ball. Wetteland picked it up 
and, when making his throw, tripped over Murray. Schulze, running hard to 
first, tripped over the bag, tumbling down the line. And second baseman Willie 
Randolph, covering first, completed the three-ring circus by dropping the ball. 
</P>
<P>
That brought up Bip Roberts, who lost his starting job at third when the Padres 
acquired Pagliarulo and was starting at shortstop only because of Garry 
Templeton's knee injury. And in midst of these trying times, Roberts arrived to 
the ballpark in a sullen mood, grieving during the day over the death of his 
wife's grandfather in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts stepped to the plate and watched Wetteland fall behind three and one in 
the count. Knowing Wetteland would have to come to him with a fastball, Roberts 
just had to make sure it was a strike. 
</P>
<P>
It was, and Roberts swung away, slapping the ball into right field. James 
scored. Pagliarulo scored. Roberts would later drive in Shawn Abner in the 
eighth for the biggest RBI night of his career. 
</P>
<P>
It was just the beginning for the Padre offense. Roberto Alomar sacrificed, 
moving Santiago and Schulze into scoring position, and Tony Gwynn was 
intentionally walked, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark drove in one run with a sacrifice fly to center, and the Padres made 
it 5-0 when Roberts scored on reliever Mike Morgan's wild pitch to the 
backstop. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres told Schulze to call it a night when they pinch-hit for him in the 
bottom of the inning. He watched an exchange of two-run homers, by Jack Clark 
in the seventh and Franklin Stubbs in the eighth. The Padres scored twice more 
in the bottom of the eight, and Schulze walked into the clubhouse as a winning 
pitcher in this league for the first time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and about the Famous Chicken? 
</P>
<P>
"Schulze told us that if he ever saw that thing again, he'd strangle it," one 
of his teammates said. 
</P>
<P>
Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
Schulze only smiled. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Eric Show, still holding out faint hope that he will not have to 
undergo back surgery for a bulging disk, will seek out two more medical 
opinions Monday. But from all indications, Show will have to undergo surgery 
sometime in the next couple of months, which would require a rehabilitation of 
six to eight weeks. "I'm open to anything right now, even acupuncture," Show 
said. "But the most important thing is getting myself healthy, and being ready 
to go by next spring. If it takes surgery, that's what I'm going to have to 
do."

CANSECO -- THE JOHNNY ROTTEN OF A'S -- TRIES TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR

<P>
The smile is boyish, the answers polite, the availability seemingly unlimited. 
This then is where Jose Canseco has chosen to begin the healing. 
</P>
<P>
This is where he begins the massive job of rebuilding a public image that's in 
tatters, of recovering from an eight-month stretch when his life seemingly has 
been a string of broken appearances and scrapes with the law. 
</P>
<P>
He begins by smiling and looking questioners in the eye, keeping the answers 
vague, yet informative. He begins by looking and sounding sincere. 
</P>
<P>
"The person I've read about is not the person I know," he says. "But I believe 
the public is behind me because all they want is for a player to go out and 
play. Other than that, I don't want to get into that stuff. I want it behind 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the person he has read about hardly resembles this smiling, friendly 
kid with the cantaloupe biceps and the Beaver Cleaver haircut. While his 
teammates defend him in their public comments, some are overly critical in 
private. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Sandy Alderson of the Oakland Athletics speaks similarly 
through tight lips and a thin tight smile. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't check Boy Scout merit badges before we sign a player, but we're not 
going to compromise our principles either," Alderson said. "I think it's pretty 
clear Jose has some growing up to do. Will this stuff be a slap in the face? I 
have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
Here's the rub: At 25 he's one of the game's brightest, youngest stars, an 
astounding mixture of power and speed. A year ago, he became the first player 
to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season and only the seventh 
unanimous choice as the American League's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he is making $1.8 million. At 6-foot-3, 230 pounds people notice him. 
They notice him even more because he likes fast cars, and until he was married 
to a former Miss Miami last winter, escorted a string of beautiful women. 
</P>
<P>
He says he just wants to go about his business, but he conducted some of it 
last winter driving a cherry-red Jaguar with "40-40" license plates. That got 
him into so much trouble that he swapped it for a white Porsche convertible. 
</P>
<P>
"At his age, he's had a lot to handle," Alderson said. "But he's not the first. 
He can't keep thinking rules are going to be bent for him because they won't 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, who chooses not to launch into a public mea culpa, could be from now 
until Christmas detailing his mistakes -- the unexplained absences, string of 
speeding tickets and unregistered handgun found on the floor of his car. 
</P>
<P>
He originally said he had registered the handgun in Florida and that he didn't 
know additional California registration was required. Later it was discovered 
that no Florida registration existed, and the case may yet come to trial if no 
plea bargain is agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
A court hearing on gun possession charges was postponed until Aug. 18 while 
lawyers sought to work out a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Lowder, San Francisco assistant district attorney, said he and Canseco's 
lawyer, Robert Shapiro, have an "agreement in principal," but have yet to 
finalize it. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said outside court that Canseco is willing to enter a plea of no 
contest to a misdemeanor charge. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco was arrested April 21 for having a loaded pistol in his sports car, 
which was parked at the UC San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there was the speeding ticket in Miami and another in Oakland, and the 
famous spring-training red light in Arizona that netted him three violations. 
</P>
<P>
His problems off the field have been made even worse because he hasn't had the 
chance to redeem himself on it. After breaking a bone in his wrist early in 
spring training, he made his 1989 debut last week. The A's went 52-36 without 
him and that is no small point of pride in their clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a team that relies on one player and I never fooled myself into 
thinking we were," Canseco said. "We have great depth." 
</P>
<P>
As Oakland ace Dave Stewart said: "Home runs get the headlines, but it's 
pitching and defense that'll win you some games. We have the same pitching we 
had last year. We haven't had the same amount of runs. Have you noticed a 
drop-off? What would it be if we didn't hold the other team to two runs so 
often?" 
</P>
<P>
Canseco smiles and says, yes, he's proud of his teammates. Likewise, he's 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the frustrating thing," he said. "I really thought I could have a 
better season than I had last year, but when you don't play, you feel like an 
outsider." 
</P>
<P>
If he's not yet 100%, a lot of teams, including the Baltimore Orioles, are 
impressed with him at 70 or 75%. He homered for the third consecutive game 
Sunday, and has five homers in 38 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
In last weekend's four-game series against the Orioles, he was 6 for 13 with 
three homers and five RBIs. Against the Angels Monday night, he singled once in 
four at-bats. "If I were 100%, who knows what I could do?" he said. "It's not 
going to be back to full strength this year. It's going to take a full 
off-season of work. The most frustrating thing is I'm getting 82 m.p.h. 
fastballs down the middle, and there's nothing I can do about them." 
</P>
<P>
If Canseco is at some kind of crossroads, as some suggest, he does not admit 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a tough year," he said. "I won't deny I've made some mistakes, but I 
think there were times I became a convenient target as well. I don't think 
there's any question about that. Again, though, I want that stuff behind me. I 
want to go out and play ball." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he admits it has been a sobering time. Earlier this month he was sent to 
a double-A team in Huntsville, Ala., for rehabilitation. He had been there 
before, but in 1985 he was a rising minor leaguer who already had a reputation 
for his monstrous home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"It brings you back to earth," Canseco said. "The last time I was in 
Huntsville, I was putting together a big year (41 homers in 540 at-bats). This 
time I go down and I can't get a ball out of the infield. You get reminded how 
hard this game is."

LARRY BIRD BREAKS BONE IN HIS BACK

Larry Bird fractured a bone in his back five minutes into his first scrimmage 
at the Boston Celtics' summer camp Saturday night and is expected to be 
sidelined for four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Bird, who missed almost all of last season with heel problems, was hurt when he 
collided with Kelvin Upshaw and fell to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have to get together with our doctor and get a full report," 
Boston Coach Jimmy Rodgers said, "and then go in the washroom and throw up." 
</P>
<P>
Bird, three-time NBA Most Valuable Player, missed all but six games last 
season. Without him, the Celtics didn't clinch a playoff berth until the final 
day of the regular season, then were swept in three games by the Detroit 
Pistons in the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays showed that Bird suffered a fracture of the transverse process in his 
lower back, Celtic spokesman Jeff Twiss said, adding that treatment will 
involve rest, massage, medication, electrical stimulation and application of 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
No disk or neurological problems were found. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics' camp runs through Tuesday night, but Twiss said Bird will return 
home to Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
After being hurt, Bird answered, "Sore," when asked how he felt. He got into a 
car and was driven away by Dr. Arnold Scheller, the Celtics' team physician. 
</P>
<P>
Bird's only comment after the X-rays was, "That's the way it goes." 
</P>
<P>
Bird and Celtic coaches had hoped that the seven scrimmages planned through 
Tuesday night would give an indication of how far he had progressed from 
surgery on both heels last Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers said that before camp began, "I couldn't ask for anything more positive 
because he felt entirely ready to get back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's buzzards' luck to have something like that happen. It's kind of a 
freakish thing." 
</P>
<P>
If Bird is sidelined six weeks, he will not return until mid-September, less 
than a month before the Celtics open their training camp on Oct. 6. They open 
the regular season Nov. 3 against the Milwaukee Bucks in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The back injury "changes Larry's rehabilitation and his workout program," 
Rodgers said. "He's going to have to stay away from all the work now, and that 
will disrupt his total rehabilitation." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Eddie Lacerte: "His activity will be severely restricted." 
</P>
<P>
Bird was near his own basket when he and Upshaw, who was playing on Bird's 
team, collided. Bird grimaced and got up slowly but continued to play for about 
a minute. He then left the gym to have his back checked. 
</P>
<P>
Before he injured his back, Bird said his rehabilitation was coming along, but 
that he was still feeling occasional discomfort in his right foot. Scheller 
said that was because there has been unanticipated bone growth in the heel area 
since the surgery.

SOTOMAYOR IS FIRST TO JUMP RECORD 8 FEET

Cuba's Javier Sotomayor became the first person to high jump 8 feet, setting a 
world record Saturday night in the Caribbean Championships. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a fantastic feat because I am the first man in jumping the eight feet, 
and that is fabulous," Sotomayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor set the previous mark of 7-11 1/2 in 1988 at Salamanca, Spain. At 
that time, his jump broke the previous outdoor world record of 7-11 set by 
Patrick Sjoeberg of Sweden in Stockholm on June 6, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, 21, also holds the indoor mark at 7-11 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
He made the historic jump on his second try. On his first attempt, Sotomayor 
touched the bar with his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4 Cuban said he was not disappointed about not being able to compete 
in last year's Seoul Olympics because of the Cuban boycott, but said he is 
looking forward to the 1992 Games at Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the 8-foot barrier is a significant mark in track and field. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's high jump, the record metrically is now 2.44 meters, exactly 8 
feet, but for Europeans, the more significant height would be 2.45 (8-0 1/2), 
because they recognize increases of five centimeters (or .05 of a meter).

MIKE DOWNEY: WHEN WILL KINGS LAND BOBBY ORR?

Hockey in July. The guy has got us talking hockey in July. And just so the 
general slapshot-happy public can keep everything straight -- although, 
remember, this could change in the next 24 hours -- here are some of the few 
remaining people Bruce McNall has not yet brought to the Los Angeles Kings, but 
still might: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The rest of the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bobby Orr, Bobby Hull or Bobby Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Howe family. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brian Boitano. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That Russian goalie, Tretiak. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Anybody born in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Either Esposito. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Czech defectors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 1980 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mario Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pepe Lepieux. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Any Detroit player not currently behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Any Sutter brother, Stastny brother, Schmenge or McKenzie brother. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Anybody nicknamed Boom Boom, Rocket, Toe, Punch, Tiger, the Cat, Moose or 
Goose. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Anybody named Guy who pronounces it Gee. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, McNall has gotten around to just about everybody. His latest 
acquisition: Larry Robinson, 17-year veteran of the Montreal Canadiens, 
defenseman deluxe and another of Canada's national treasures. 
</P>
<P>
A million-six? Sure thing. Sign here. How many years you want, Lar? Two? Three? 
You got it. 
</P>
<P>
Love that Bruce! You gotta love this guy, if you love good hockey players. He 
wants 'em, he gets 'em. Oh, we assume that General Manager Rogie Vachon dials 
the phone, but McNall is the man behind the scenes, the man with the checkbook 
as thick as the Yellow Pages, the man who is going to bring a championship 
hockey club to California if he has to sell every expensive black silk suit he 
owns and go around the Forum wearing a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
McNall is turning into Bob Barker. Wayne Gretzky, come on down! Larry Robinson, 
come on down! Kelly Hrudey, come out West! Steve Kasper, Mike Krushelnyski, 
John Tonelli, Ron Duguay, Marty McSorley, Chris Kontos, good guys, tough guys, 
old guys, unwanted guys, come on out to Bruce's Holiday on Ice! The Kings said, 
"California is the place you oughta be," so they loaded up the truck and they 
moved to Beverly. Hills, that is. Swimming pools. Movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Robinson will lend a hand to a defense sorely in need of one. L.A. has 
enough offense to take a Stanley Cup, but not enough defense, except in goal. 
Even if Robinson is not the player he used to be, he was good enough to work 
long shifts for Montreal during the 1989 Stanley Cup finals, and in savvy alone 
he's an asset. Glad to have him. 
</P>
<P>
Canadians (and Canadiens) must be going nuts, though. The sight of Gretzky and 
Robinson in Los Angeles uniforms . . . ugh. Picture Magic Johnson playing for 
San Antonio. Or how about Chris Evert defecting to Czechoslovakia? 
</P>
<P>
Don't you get the feeling, too, that McNall is just getting started? He's got 
an offensive super-hero, a defensive wonder, a goalie, a new coach, new 
uniforms, a guy with a "lucky butt" as a good-luck charm, Sylvester Stallone at 
rinkside.. . . What more could anyone want? A 25,000-seat arena in the Valley? 
A practice facility in Palm Springs with hot-and-cold running Molson's from the 
faucets? His own TV super-station? 
</P>
<P>
McNall has it all. He and Gretzky own a horse together, so it'll probably win 
the Breeders' Cup or something. McNall could probably buy a donkey and win the 
Preakness, the lucky butt. 
</P>
<P>
We thought for a while that the Kings might sign Guy Lafleur, who has been 
around so long he calls Larry Robinson Sonny. But Lafleur has signed with the 
Quebec Nordiques, proving that there are some guys even Los Angeles can't buy. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal center Bobby Smith believes Lafleur is putting too much of a load on 
himself. "He's going to be in the spotlight now, and he's going to have the 
type of pressure he wouldn't have faced in Los Angeles, let's say, where Wayne 
Gretzky and Bernie Nicholls and Luc Robitaille are such great players." 
</P>
<P>
We can't help wondering who else McNall might get his hands on before too long. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he will raid Edmonton again. If he can't get goalie Grant Fuhr, who is so 
fed up with Oiler management that he announced his retirement at 26, we can 
easily see McNall getting his hands on Jimmy Carson, who could play out the 
rest of his contract at Edmonton, then sign with the Kings as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
It is no big National Hockey League secret that Carson would love to return to 
Los Angeles. He still has a house here. It wasn't Carson's fault that he was 
ordered to leave the country in the great Gretzky trade on Aug. 9, 1988. Carson 
is an all-star who still might be as good as Gretzky someday, and has a dozen 
years or more left to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
Boy, this is fun, talking hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Let's get this baseball business over with and get back to the good stuff.

RECORD START HELPS KING GLORIOUS WIN EASILY DESPITE INGLORIOUS FINISH

Asked if King Glorious can carry his speed farther than 1 1/8 miles, jockey 
Chris McCarron said that he isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious, absent from the Triple Crown races because of a healing knee, 
added to his near-perfect record Saturday, winning the $500,000 Haskell 
Invitational Handicap by three lengths before a Monmouth Park crowd of 26,740. 
</P>
<P>
Nine 3-year-olds chased King Glorious around the track, in much the way nine 
horses pursued him in the Ohio Derby -- also at 1 1/8 miles -- at Thistledown 
six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Music Merci, another California-based horse who finished second to King 
Glorious in last December's Hollywood Juvenile, was second again, by a neck 
over Shy Tom. Rampart Road ran fourth, another 1 1/4 lengths back. Next were Le 
Voyageur, Arcadia Falls, Mercedes Won, Bio, Halo Hansom and Seattle Glow. 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious, who has been favored in every race he has run, won for the 
eighth time in nine starts and earned $300,000 for his owners, Ted Aroney of 
Carlsbad and Alan Magerman of Philadelphia. Aroney bought King Glorious' dam, 
Glorious Natalie, for $6,700 when she was in foal to Naevus, and the owner 
bought King Glorious back for $6,500 when bidding stopped on the colt at a 
California yearling sale. 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious' earnings now are nearly $1.2 million. His only loss came in May 
at Golden Gate Fields, where Avenging Force beat him by 1 1/4 lengths going 1 
1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
While King Glorious only toyed with his opponents Saturday, his winning time 
was a dull 1:49 4/5, the slowest Haskell in 11 years despite sunny weather. The 
time was three seconds slower than Spend a Buck's track record. 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious' owners and his trainer, Jerry Hollendorfer, left open the 
prospect of challenging Easy Goer, the winner of the Belmont and leading 3- 
year-old in the country, in the 1 1/4-mile Travers at Saratoga on Aug. 19. 
McCarron said that he would like to see King Glorious try to stretch out 
another eighth of a mile in the Travers. 
</P>
<P>
After running the fastest opening half-mile (:45 2/5) and the second-fastest 
opening six furlongs (1:09 3/5) in Haskell history, King Glorious lost half of 
a six-length lead by running the final eighth of a mile in :13 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron hit King Glorious four times right-handed and once left-handed through 
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised he slowed down," McCarron said. "He was getting late toward 
the end. But that really doesn't tell me anything about the horse. I've 
compared this horse to Precisionist a lot, and I remember what he did in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Silver Screen (a 1 1/8-mile race at Hollywood Park), Precisionist just 
stopped (and finished third). I thought Ross Fenstermaker (Precisionist's 
trainer) was nuts to run him back at 1 1/4 miles in the Swaps a couple of weeks 
later, but then he won the race by 12 lengths (actually, it was 10). So what 
I'm saying is that you never know with horses." 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the gate, Music Merci made the lead under Gary Stevens. King Glorious, 
breaking from the No. 7 post, was outside in third place, also behind Mercedes 
Won, going around the clubhouse turn. Leaving the turn, however, King Glorious 
pushed McCarron to the lead, a lead that was one or two lengths down the 
backside until they opened up on the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
"The race track is speed biased, and I wanted to stay in the race," Stevens 
said. "I rushed him pretty good out of the gate, whereas I usually just let him 
settle into a race. He never really seemed comfortable down the backstretch, 
never settled into stride, because he didn't like me pushing on him like that. 
At the end, I saw Chris let out a notch, and I knew there was no chance of 
catching his horse." 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious, carrying high weight of 123 pounds, three more than Music Merci, 
paid $3.40, $2.60 and $2.20. Music Merci returned $3.80 and $3.20 and Shy Tom 
paid $3.40. A $2 exacta on King Glorious and Music Merci was worth $9.60. 
</P>
<P>
The French-based Le Voyageur ran a creditable third behind Easy Goer and Sunday 
Silence in the Belmont. But as the 2-1 second choice Saturday, the son of 
Seattle Slew and Davona Dale was beaten by almost seven lengths. 
</P>

His trainer, Patrick-Louis Biancone, took the blame. "I didn't have him fit for 
this race," Biancone said. "He had too much rest. He had not too much rest for 
the Belmont, but too much for this race. But of course, I really brought him 
here with the idea of getting him ready for the next one (the Travers)."

McCarron rode seven other races on the Haskell program and won two. In the 
$35,000 Ocean Hotel Stakes, the race that preceded the Haskell, McCarron rode 
Brown Rice to victory by a neck.

<P>
Earlier, McCarron lost the $35,000 Battlefield Stakes by a neck as Crystal 
Moment edged out My Babys Fast. Stevens rode Crystal Moment.

DAVIS SEIZES MOMENT, WINS WITH CLAIRE MARINE IN PALOMAR

Chris McCarron had better hurry home. 
</P>
<P>
While he was in New Jersey Saturday, winning the Haskell Handicap on King 
Glorious, Robbie Davis was back home at Del Mar taking care of business. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Marine, usually ridden by McCarron, reinforced her reputation of being 
the best turf filly in the country as Davis rode her to victory in the $109,800 
Palomar Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Marine scored her fourth stakes win of the year by 1 3/4 lengths over 
stablemate Galunpe. It was the first time she had raced against the 
accomplished Annoconnor at level weights of 122 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
But Annoconnor had no answer for Claire Marine's challenge through the final 
furlong of the 1 1/16-mile race. Daring Doone, Annoconnor's longshot 
stablemate, came along late to take third; Annoconnor was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron had ridden Claire Marine to each of her 1989 victories for trainer 
Charlie Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
"What could we do?" said McCarron's agent, Scott McClellan. "King Glorious is 
the best colt Chris is riding, and Claire Marine is probably the best filly. 
When they find a way to beam jockeys around the country, McCarron will be 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But until that time, Davis is more than happy to play the role of super sub. 
Before the Palomar he had been riding Galunpe. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris gave me some pointers about the filly before he left," said Davis, who 
is leading the Del Mar meeting in his first season at the seaside track. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a lot kinder when she can rate behind another horse," the native of 
Idaho said. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, she's not that hard to ride." 
</P>
<P>
Choritzo, an Irish mare who won a small stakes at Del Mar last year, went to 
the lead as anticipated. Corey Black had Annoconnor in second and Claire Marine 
was third. 
</P>
<P>
Those three proceeded in that order down the backstretch and into the far turn. 
With a quarter of a mile to run, Annoconnor caught Choritzo, but Black was far 
from confident. 
</P>
<P>
"I was keeping my eye on Claire Marine to make sure she didn't get the jump on 
me," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out, my mare just didn't run her race. The way it came up, she 
should have sailed home." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Annoconnor surrendered meekly while Claire Marine pulled clear to the 
wire. Galunpe was second by three-quarters of a length over Daring Doone. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Marine's time was 1:43 1/5, a reflection of the slow early pace (:49 for 
the half) and the deep turf. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittingham-trained entry returned $4, $3.40 and $2.10 across the board. 
Daring Doone returned $4.20. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, who owns Claire Marine in partnership with Sidney Port, said that 
the filly would run next in the $500,000 Beverly D. Stakes at Arlington Park 
Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are good that McCarron has left that date open; but just in case, Davis 
will be hanging around the Whittingham barn, with that pinch-hitter's look in 
his eye. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Del Mar handle Saturday, including 11 off-track sites, was $9,621,121, 
second highest in the history of the track. . . . King Glorious and Music Merci 
weren't the only California shippers to do well Saturday. Present Value and 
Paramount Jet finished 1-2 in the Equipoise Mile at Arlington Park. Present 
Value paid $4.20, compared to the $100.60 he returned in winning the Michigan 
Mile in Detroit two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
California horsemen are awaiting official word from the Horse Racing Board 
office in Sacramento before launching the new Lasix medication policies. As 
approved by the Board last Thursday, there will be limits of four hours before 
a race and 250 milliliters. . . . Robbie Davis leads Eddie Delahoussaye in 
victories, 7-6, through the first four days of the meeting. . . . Laffit Pincay 
won three races on Saturday, including two for trainer Wayne Lukas.

RAMS SIGN TONY SLATON TO ONE-YEAR CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams got another offensive lineman into camp Saturday when reserve 
center-guard Tony Slaton agreed to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Slaton's signing eased a major concern for Ram Coach John Robinson, who 
appeared headed into the exhibition season with a makeshift offensive line. But 
the signing of Slaton and left tackle Irv Pankey this weekend gives the Rams 
three starters and a top backup in Slaton. 
</P>
<P>
To make room for Pankey, the team released Thor Salanoa, a linebacker from BYU. 
They must make room for Slaton today.

STANKOWSKI LEADS SOCAL TEAM IN PACIFIC COAST PLAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Paul Stankowski of Oxnard won the 90th annual Southern California Amateur 
golf championship last Sunday at Glendora Country Club, he became the first 
teen-age winner of the prestigious event in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Stankowski, 19, a junior at Texas El Paso, shot 279, nine under par, over the 
narrow, tree-lined course, defeating Randy Drake, the home club favorite, by 
three strokes. It was the second summer victory for Stankowski, who a few weeks 
ago won the Oxnard city championship. 
</P>
<P>
His next outing will be the 23rd annual Pacific Coast Amateur tournament, which 
starts Tuesday at the Olympic Club in San Francisco. Stankowski heads an 
eight-man team that will represent the Southern California Golf Assn. in the 
72-hole event. 
</P>
<P>
Other team members are David Stockton of Mentone, last year's runner-up; Jerry 
Michals of Vista; Craig Steinberg of Tarzana; Buz Greene of Thousand Oaks; 
George Lombino of Lynwood; Jack Spradlin Jr. of San Diego, and Pat Duncan of 
Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
Representing the Southern California Public Links Assn. will be Kelly Manos of 
Cypress, Dan Pouliot of Burbank, Tony Chieffo of Granada Hills and Dave 
Fernandes of Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
After the Pacific Coast Amateur, Stankowski will try to qualify for the United 
States Amateur, Aug. 7, at Palos Verdes, where 114 players will be going for 
seven berths in the tournament at Merion, Pa., Aug. 22-27. 
</P>
<P>
The last teen-ager to win the SoCal was Jeff Hart of Solana Beach, who was 19 
and a student at USC when he won in 1979. The only younger winners in the 
nation's oldest continuously contested amateur tournament were Al Geiberger of 
Santa Barbara in 1956 and Doug Clarke of La Jolla in 1977, who were 18. 
</P>
<P>
Stankowski, who plays out of the SeaBee Golf Club of Port Hueneme, received a 
scholarship from UTEP on the basis of winning the Channel League championship 
as a senior at Oxnard High. He also finished fifth and third as a 16- and 
17-year-old in Junior World tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Paul, whose brother Tom won the Los Angeles City junior title in 1982 before 
playing four years at Arizona State, has been playing golf since his father 
started him in the game at 8. Tom, who is now playing on the Golden State Tour 
as a professional, caddied for Paul in his Glendora triumph. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California golf enthusiasts were taken by surprise when popular Tom 
McHugh was released as professional and course manager at Los Angeles Royal 
Vista, formerly Pomona National, in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
McHugh, 60, started at the 27-hole facility in 1967 as director of the National 
Golf Courses properties that included the Ontario and Corona courses as well as 
Pomona. He left briefly in the 1970s to become director of golf at Cathedral 
Canyon Country Club in Palm Springs, but returned in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"The course (Pomona National) lost more than $100,000 in 1977 and we turned it 
around in three years," McHugh said. "I ran the course like it was my own. I 
wouldn't have done a thing different if I'd owned it myself." 
</P>
<P>
One of McHugh's most successful innovations was a St. Patrick's Day tournament 
for which players signed up months in advance to make sure they could get 
starting times. He also thought up the Comedian's Golf Classic and the 
California 500 Celebrity tournament, which featured such players as James 
Garner, Bob Newhart, Don Rickles, Joey Bishop and Claude Akins. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have a meeting of the minds on the way the course should be 
operated," A. C. (Sandy) Waterhouse Jr., owner of L.A. Royal Vista, said of 
McHugh's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Horning, formerly of the San Ramon National course in Northern California, 
has replaced McHugh.

The purse for the 18th annual Queen Mary Open, Aug. 17-20, has been increased 
$10,000 to $110,000, according to tournament director Doug Ives. First two 
rounds will be played at the Skylinks and Lakewood courses in Long Beach, with 
Lakewood the site of the final two rounds. John McComish, last year's champion, 
will not defend, since he is now playing on the PGA Tour. The Len Kennett 
Putting championship will be held at Lakewood in conjunction with the 
tournament, offering a purse of $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia's win in the British Open moved him up to fifth in the Sony 
worldwide rankings, behind Seve Ballesteros, Greg Norman, Nick Faldo and Curtis 
Strange. . . . Pro Bob Spencer of Sierra La Verne knows the way around his home 
course. Spencer, who is playing in the Senior British Open this week, has made 
three holes in one this year at Sierra La Verne, the most remarkable with a 
driver on the downhill 405-yard 11th hole. Two days earlier, he had missed an 
ace on the same hole by a foot, according to George DeLellis, who witnessed all 
three aces. 
</P>
<P>
Al Geiberger, Jack Nicklaus, Kathy Whitworth and Hubie Green have been inducted 
into the Collegiate Hall of Fame. . . . Robert Gamez of Arizona, the Pacific 10 
champion, has been awarded the Nicklaus Trophy, given annually to the top 
collegiate player in the country. . . . When Brad Greer won the Greater 
Sacramento Open, it was the first time a player had ever repeated as champion 
in a Golden State Tour event. Greer is a two-time SoCal Amateur champion from 
Huntington Beach.

Julie Lynd of Lake Arrowhead CC won the 18th annual Southern California Women's 
Masters championship by two strokes over defending champion Sue Ewart of Old 
Ranch. Lynd shot 230 in the tournament for club champions, which was held at 
Industry Hills, California and Sierra La Verne. Low net was a tie between Kiiko 
Kimihara of Industry Hills and Sue Hanki of Palm Meadows at 226. Teri Melanson 
of Rancho Park had long drive of 254 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Park's nine-hole course is open again after having been closed for 
several weeks during construction of a new irrigation system. . . . Billy 
Casper, Johnny Miller and Gene Littler are the three best male golfers and 
Mickey Wright the best female golfer born in California, according to Golf 
Digest.

A 64 BOOSTS STEWART INTO LEAD IN MICHIGAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Payne Stewart, displaying the skills that have made him one of the PGA Tour's 
top money-winners, shot an eight-under-par 64 Saturday for a one-stroke lead 
over Hal Sutton in the $1-million Buick Open golf tournament at Grand Blanc, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was at 14-under-par 202 after three rounds on the 7,014-yard course at 
Warwick Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton, co-leader with Doug Tewell after two rounds, shot a 68. Sutton could 
have tied Stewart, but his 20-foot birdie attempt at No. 18 stopped inches 
short. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart started the third round three strokes behind the leaders but birdied 
five of the first seven holes to make the turn at 11 under par. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart got to 14 under par with a birdie on No. 16, a 580-yard, par-five hole. 
He lost a shot with a bogey on the par-three 17th, then got it back with a 
seven-iron shot from behind a tree that led to a four-foot birdie putt on the 
final hole. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton sandwiched a bogey between two birdies and made the turn at 10 under 
par. But three birdies on the back side kept him in the chase for his first PGA 
Tour victory since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Tewell shot a 70 and was at 205. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Fergon, who nearly missed her tee-off time because of beach traffic, shot 
a four-under-par 66 to share the lead with Chris Johnson after two rounds of 
the $225,000 LPGA Atlantic City tournament at Somers Point, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Fergon and Johnson, who shot her second straight 68, had 36-hole totals of 
four-under-par 136 and were one stroke ahead of first-round leader Nancy Lopez, 
who shot a 70 on the 6,020-yard Sands Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy King, a five-time winner this year, was tied with Amy Alcott, Rosie Jones 
and Susan Sanders at 138. King had a 70, Alcott a 67, Sanders a 68 and Jones a 
69. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Henning shot a seven-under-par 65 to take a two-stroke lead over Dick 
Hendrickson after two rounds of the $275,000 Newport Cup seniors tournament at 
Newport, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Henning had eight birdies and one bogey and was at nine-under-par 135. 
Hendrickson, who shot a 68, was one stroke ahead of Chick Evans and Tom Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
Brandie Burton of Rialto, Calif., won three of the first four holes and hung on 
for a 1-up victory over Camie Hoshino of Hilo, Hawaii, to win the U.S. Girls' 
Junior Amateur golf title at Pine Needles Resort in Southern Pines, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
David Duval of Ponte Vedra, Fla., survived a late charge by Austin Maki of 
Costa Mesa, Calif., to win, 1 up, in the final of the 42nd U.S. Boys' Junior 
Amateur golf championship at Singing Hills Country Club in El Cajon.

Steve Walsh, who refuted reports that the Dallas Cowboys want to trade him, 
signed a four-year $4.1-million contract and joined another millionaire, Troy 
Aikman, in a battle for the starting quarterback job. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe now the Cowboys really want me to compete for the job," said Walsh, 
who lost only once in two years as the starter for the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh could be traded to any NFL team this year but can refuse a trade to four 
teams he selects next season. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who received a $900,000 bonus to sign, was passed over by Atlanta in the 
National Football League supplemental draft. The Cowboys took him, although 
they had signed UCLA's Aikman to a six-year, $11.037-million contract.

Alain Prost of France had the second-fastest time, 1:43.295.

KEEPING UP WITH JONES; 
</P>
<P>
12 MONTHS, 3 TRADES LATER, TRACY THE TIGER FEELS AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM MARCHIANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The manager wanted to prove his point, so he cupped his hands around his mouth 
and hollered from the dugout: "Hey, Tracy Jones!" 
</P>
<P>
In the sunshine of Anaheim Stadium, Tracy Jones smiled and waved as he trotted 
by, but he did not say a word. 
</P>
<P>
"See, I told you he doesn't say much to me. He's real quiet," said Detroit 
Tigers manager Sparky Anderson, with a smile of his own. "Besides, I always 
judge a person by how they are with me, not how they are with someone else. 
That's not fair. I won't ask another manager how a player is. I decide." 
</P>
<P>
And for this Jones is thankful. The 28-year-old former Lawndale High School and 
Loyola Marymount star outfielder has been purposely unobtrusive since his trade 
from the San Francisco Giants to the Tigers on June 17. 
</P>
<P>
After two tumultuous years in the big leagues that have included numerous 
squabbles with management, a reputation as one of the sport's most disliked 
players and three trades in 12 months, Jones says he's ready for a quieter and 
more stable life. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I say is sometimes mixed up or taken out of context. It got me in 
trouble in Cincinnati and it got me in trouble in San Francisco," Jones said 
before a recent game against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"So now I'm just low-key. I just keep saying boring stuff. I just want to stay 
here and keep my mouth shut. You never know. You may be misunderstood and get 
in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Jones hopes that Anderson understands him because others have not. In 1987 
Jones, a right-handed hitter and a 1983 first-round draft choice out of Loyola, 
became a popular Cincinnati player by batting .290 and stealing 31 bases. His 
spirited style of play gained the admiration of both Reds fans and manager Pete 
Rose. 
</P>
<P>
But early in the following season, his hustle placed him on the disabled list 
when he injured his knee trying to field a foul ball. When he returned, Rose 
platooned him with lefty batter Paul O'Neill and bitter exchanges between Rose 
and Jones ensued. During the '88 All-Star break, Jones was traded to Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came in, I was getting standing ovations in Cincinnati. I could do no 
wrong. Everyday I'd pick up the paper and there would be something about me. 
Everything was positive," Jones recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you start having a little trouble or you go into your first slump. Then 
you run into trouble with Pete, which wasn't really all that much, and you 
don't read about yourself on the sports page -- but on the front page on the 
paper: 'Jones and Rose at It Again.' 
</P>
<P>
"Stuff like that just wore on me. It's tough to play like that." 
</P>
<P>
Although he batted .317 for the Expos, Jones didn't last long in Montreal. 
During the winter meetings last December, Montreal swapped Jones for another 
outfielder, San Francisco's Mike Aldrete. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I'd be in Montreal for a while. I liked it there and I did well," 
Jones said. "I like (Expos manager) Buck Rodgers, and my teammates were great. 
I bought a home in Juno Beach, Fla.(near the Montreal spring training camp), 
and I'll be damned if I don't get traded. And Candlestick was not one of my 
favorite ballparks." 
</P>
<P>
Jones did not have much time to lament about Candlestick, or anything else in 
San Francisco. Like Montreal, San Francisco was merely a pit stop. In 97 
at-bats Jones hit .186, seeing little playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't being counted on in San Francisco. It's like I told (Giants manager) 
Roger (Craig): 'If you think I'm the 24th guy on the team, you're wrong.' It 
was getting so bad that I couldn't sleep. I was going through that much of a 
problem. It was really the first time that I had failed. That has hurt me a lot 
as far as confidence. I got it back here." 
</P>
<P>
So for Jones, being traded from a first-place team to the club with the worst 
record in baseball has had advantages. In the 28 games he has played for 
Detroit, Jones is batting .264 with three home runs, including a homer in his 
first at-bat as a Tiger on June 17. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeez, he (Jones) has to be important here," Anderson said. "When you've got 
(Will) Clark and (Kevin) Mitchell, you become very unimportant. Once he gets 
his knee squared away, there's no question he'll be playing every day. He's a 
strong kid." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is concerned about Jones' knee because the 6-foot-3, 210-pounder still 
experiences soreness after arthroscopic surgery last season and shares time 
with left-handed batter Fred Lynn. Jones will be operated on again after this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little shaky and it's going to have to be worked on," Jones said. "I 
can't run the way I used to. I'm a little slower and I'm taking it easier." 
</P>
<P>
Jones has decided that being reserved on the playing field as well as in his 
public comments is the best way for him to lengthen his young -- yet 
action-packed -- career. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I've been through so much in four years that players who played 10 
or 12 never go through. That's why I'm saying I'm exhausted from moving. I'm 
tired of it and tired of the pressure. The things that I've said to the 
management and the press have put more added pressure on," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad that's through. It's too hard mentally. People start thinking 
that there's something wrong with me and that I'm a troublemaker," continued 
Jones, who was voted the National League's "most hated player" by his peers in 
a USA Today's preseason poll last season. 
</P>
<P>
"They get real skeptical of me and I don't want that because anybody that has 
ever come in contact with me hasn't had problems." 
</P>
<P>
Staying in one place is even more important to Jones now that he and his 
fiancee, 24-year-old Debi Horn, have set a wedding date of Oct. 27. Horn has 
moved with Jones throughout the year, and while he says the difficult times 
have strengthened their relationship, love does know some bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"She just tells me to keep my mouth shut. She says she's tired of packing my 
stuff and if I get traded again, I'm packing," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it looks like keeping up with Jones might just get a lot easier.

NICKOLAI PADS STREET STOCK LEAD WITH MAIN EVENT VICTORY AT SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN FLEISCHMAN, Special to the Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Nickolai of Simi Valley may work for a local Ford dealer, but he sure 
knows how to drive his Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
Nickolai, the points leader in the Street Stock division, increased his lead 
with a 25-lap main-event win Saturday night at Saugus Speedway before a crowd 
of 4,344. 
</P>
<P>
Nickolai also won a trophy dash and heat race earlier in the night, all in his 
1970 Chevrolet Chevelle. But it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
"We blew the transmission on the figure 8 heat race," said Nickolai, who led 
the whole way. "We kept it in, though. The thing was shaking and vibrating like 
you wouldn't believe. On the restarts I started out in fourth gear just to keep 
the RPMs down." 
</P>
<P>
Dale White Jr., also of Simi Valley, finished second, just ahead of Rip Michels 
of Arleta. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Kelly of Arleta won the 15-lap Hobby Stock figure 8 main event, his sixth 
feature race win of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 25-lap Hobby Stock main event, Thad Friday of Reseda held off 
Kelly's late charge to win. 
</P>
<P>
Friday passed Joe Barreras Jr. of Canyon Country, who had car trouble, on Lap 
16 to win his second main event of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly finished second, followed by Shannon Flavin of West Hills and Scott Wade 
of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Bolio won the 15-lap jalopy main event, passing North Hollywood's Robert 
Wade, who finished second, on Lap 11. Wade had taken the lead from Andrew 
Debiaso of Van Nuys on Lap 9 when Debiaso spun out. 
</P>
<P>
John Kirby of Ventura handily won a 12-lap Street Stock semi-main event to 
advance to the main event. Also advancing were Sue Pittinato of West Hills, 
Brian Polzin of Saugus and Larry Ofria of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the night, Rick Crow of Canyon Country broke the track's 
two-year-old oval qualifying record for Street Stocks with a time of 18.54. The 
previous record, set in 1987 by John Cran, was 18.62. 
</P>
<P>
Crow might have pushed his car too hard, however, as he blew his transmission. 
Still, Crow was able to continue after borrowing a transmission from Craig 
Rayburn. 
</P>
<P>
Barreras, who entered the night eighth in Hobby Stock points, won a figure 8 
heat race of Hobby Stock and Jalopy cars. Earlier, Barreras won a trophy dash 
and another heat race.

VALLEY DEFENDERS ENABLE SOUTH TO DEFUSE NORTH IN SHRINE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South defense cut the North off at the pass with three key interceptions 
and won the 38th Shrine Game, 23-7, Saturday night before a crowd of 26,100 at 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The South showed the best defense since the Oliver North trial, and three 
Valley-area players recorded the only three interceptions of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Carrick O'Quinn of Agoura picked off a pass by Kris Hansen in the third quarter 
and Ron Redell of Crespi and Sean Burwell of Cleveland intercepted two passes 
by Billy Owens in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to trim a 17-7 deficit, the North had just entered South territory when 
Owens lofted a bomb into the end zone for wide receiver Donnell Ragsdale. 
</P>
<P>
Ragsdale and Redell lept for the ball, and both grabbed for it. Redell yanked 
it away, though, for the touchdown-saving interception. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was mine," said Redell, normally known for his expertise as a 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"The key interception I felt was when Ronnie got that ball at the goal line," 
South Coach Tim Burroughs said. "That was the turning point of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Redell also backed up Curtis Conway at quarterback and completed two of three 
passes. He played only two series each half at safety. 
</P>
<P>
Redell plans on playing quarterback at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
He and Burwell, who intends to play running back at Oregon, both said they hope 
their defensive exploits go unnoticed by their future coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they didn't watch the game," Burwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Burwell started at cornerback and notched his interception on the 
second-to-last play of the game. The North was making a last-ditch attempt to 
score when Burwell stepped in front of an errant pass by Owens along the 
sideline at the South 12. 
</P>
<P>
"We were four-deep because we knew they were going to throw," said Burwell, a 
Times All-Valley defensive back. "I caught it, and I was right on the line. I 
wanted to run it." 
</P>
<P>
O'Quinn returned his interception eight yards to set up the South's second 
touchdown. A UCLA recruit, O'Quinn picked off a tipped pass from his inside 
linebacker position. 
</P>
<P>
"Jason Uhl put some serious pressure on the quarterback, and it messed up his 
throwing," O'Quinn said. "It bounced off the receiver's hands into mine. I 
didn't do anything. I was just there." 
</P>
<P>
O'Quinn played all but two of the South's defensive downs. O'Quinn played at 
Division VII Agoura and was looking to prove himself against the state's best 
players, while impressing the fans at his future home field. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, when I was going into camp, I was kind of shaky. I didn't know how I 
was going to match up with these guys," O'Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Quinn and Burwell each notched three tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi's Russell White, the state's all-time leading rusher, carried the ball 
seven times for 33 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't mentally into it," said White, who visibly favored his injured left 
knee. "You could tell I wasn't 100%, but I was doing what I could." 
</P>
<P>
White did break loose for a 12-yard gain, but was stopped on several occasions 
for littler or no gain. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's Brian Allen saw extensive action at tight end but did not catch a pass. 
Rick McCathron of Thousand Oaks played several series on the offensive line.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: WAIKIKI HOTEL DISCOUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HANK KOVELL, Kovell is a veteran journalist in seniors' interests. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The welcome mat is out in Honolulu's Waikiki resort area, where the tourism 
boom continues. 
</P>
<P>
Although many travelers deplore the commercialism and overbuilding that all but 
obscures the 1 1/2-mile stretch of white sandy beach and the calm blue waters 
of the Pacific Ocean, Kalakaua Avenue -- the heart of Waikiki -- continues to 
draw record crowds. 
</P>
<P>
With a mild, constant temperature and little need for jackets or neckties, plus 
dozens of sightseeing attractions and a great selection of water sports, 
Waikiki has enhanced its appeal with an increasing number of concessions 
designed to attract mature travelers. 
</P>
<P>
The largest hotel group in Honolulu, Outrigger Hotels Hawaii, is offering 
senior rates to anyone over 50, proof of which must be provided upon check-in. 
For more information, call toll-free (800) 367-5170. 
</P>
<P>
The newly refurbished Hilton Hawaiian Village is Hawaii's largest hotel, with 
more than 2,500 rooms. The hotel's shopping village provides discounts up to 
50% under its Senior Honors program, which brings rates in three of the four 
towers down to $100 a night and $150 in the exclusive Ali'i Tower. 
</P>
<P>
At the Hilton, meal discounts of 20% are offered at the Don Ho Dinner Show, 
Catamaran Sunset Dinner Sail and Rainbow Hawaiian Fare Buffet. Call Hilton at 
(800) 445-8667. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheraton group of hotels, which includes the Sheraton Waikiki, the 
venerable Ala Moana, the Royal Hawaiian and the Princess Kaiualini, offer the 
systemwide 25% discount for seniors. Call (800) 325-3535. 
</P>
<P>
Other nationwide chains with hotels in Waikiki that offer senior discounts 
include Best Western, Colony, Days Inns, Quality Inns and Ramada. 
</P>
<P>
Some hotels provide only a limited number of rooms for senior discounts, and 
certain holiday periods may be restricted. Minimum age limits vary, and 
reservations are always on a space-available basis. Proof of age may be a 
driver's license, passport or membership in a recognized senior organization 
such as AARP. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Flight Rates 
</P>
<P>
Discounts for travelers over 65 are also offered on the two inter-island 
airlines, Aloha and Hawaiian airlines. Both offer a $10 discount off the 
regular $49.95 fare between any of the Hawaiian islands. 
</P>
<P>
A Sunrise Special, not limited to seniors, provides for an even less expensive 
fare of $29.95 for the first and last flights of the day from Honolulu Airport 
to any neighboring island. 
</P>
<P>
There's a simple way for the mature traveler to find restaurants that offer 
senior discounts. Such restaurants are marked in the Honolulu phone book Yellow 
Pages with a star symbol. Many of these restaurants are branches of major U.S. 
chains, such as Denny's, Burger King and Sizzler steak houses. Amount of 
discount and age limits vary. 
</P>
<P>
During certain hours the Jolly Roger gives patrons over 60 years 20% off. 
Burger King offers 10% off for those over 55, while Denny's and Sizzler have 
special senior menus. Some independent restaurants offer discounts on lunch or 
dinner only. 
</P>
<P>
Many movie theaters in Honolulu offer special rates of $3 for seniors over age 
65 at any time of day or evening and on holidays. Some sightseeing attractions 
and sports-equipment rental outlets offer senior discounts. Free tourist 
publications with ample information on what to do and see in Honolulu are in 
the city's new display racks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Charge on Buses 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest bargains for seniors in Honolulu is the E&amp;H (Elderly and 
Handicapped) BusCard, which permits the holder unlimited transportation on the 
city bus line, MTL. 
</P>
<P>
Known locally as The Bus, the network of routes serves the entire island of 
Oahu. The pass is valid on any line at any time of day or night, without 
restrictions. And the price is right -- it is issued to anyone over age 65 at 
no charge. 
</P>
<P>
Apply at the MTL headquarters with a passport, birth certificate or valid 
driver's license from any state, and you'll be photographed and presented with 
a laminated plastic identification card that's valid until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on the Waikiki area, write to Waikiki Beach Operators 
Assn., 820 Mililani St., No. 400-K, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813. For information on 
obtaining the free E&amp;H BusCard, in Honolulu call (808) 531-0431. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
The off-season in the Soviet Union -- fall, winter and spring -- is also its 
cultural season. During that period, prices are lower and groups are smaller. 
Tourists have gone. Love Holidays/Uniworld Tours, which has been providing 
travel for mature travelers for many years, has created several packages for 
the 1989-1990 season in conjunction with Finnair, the national airline of 
Finland. 
</P>
<P>
Four itineraries are offered that cover from eight to 11 days, with departure 
dates from November until next April. Prices begin at $1,268 and include 
round-trip air transportation from West Coast cities, all transport within the 
Soviet Union, deluxe and first-class hotels, plus three meals daily. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow you get a theater performance and visits to the Kremlin and Red 
Square. In Leningrad the Hermitage Museum is visited. All four tours include 
Leningrad and Moscow and one or two additional cities, depending on the 
itinerary selected. 
</P>
<P>
A color brochure that gives complete details, including prices, components and 
itineraries, is available from Love Holidays/Uniworld, 15315 Magnolia Blvd., 
Sherman Oaks 91403, or call (800) HLO-LOVE (456-5683), (213) 873-7991 or (818) 
501-6868.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: AIRPORT DEPARTURE FEES ARE A TAXING EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
Getting there may still be half the fun, but in dozens of countries around the 
world, leaving can sometimes be less than pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
It's all thanks to a hidden -- at least a poorly publicized -- travel charge 
that you probably aren't even aware of until you arrive at the airport, ready 
to board your plane. 
</P>
<P>
It's called the departure tax, a nasty little addendum to the cost of your 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
Ask travelers who have just left Australia, Japan or Hong Kong, and chances are 
they'll complain about being hit with some pretty heavy departure taxes. 
</P>
<P>
And chances also are that they had no idea of the additional charge until they 
arrived at the airport to leave each country. 
</P>
<P>
There are other unhappy passengers leaving Mexico, the Bahamas, Bangladesh or 
Brazil, Singapore, Sri Lanka and the Sudan who were forced to pay departure 
taxes -- in local currency. More than 50 countries charge a departure tax. 
</P>
<P>
When Japan opened Narita Airport in 1978, the government began charging a 
departure tax on all passengers embarking on international flights. The charge 
is 2,000 yen, about $14 U.S. A sign hanging in the airport at Puerto Vallarta, 
Mexico, announces that the current departure tax is $10, "subject to change." 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's departure tax used to be $120 Hong Kong (about $15 U.S.). Recently 
the tax was lowered to $100 Hong Kong, still stiff at about $13 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forced Delays 
</P>
<P>
The problem with the departure tax goes beyond its cost. More often than not, 
the fee can force delays. I'm writing from experience. On a number of occasions 
I have converted my local currency back to U.S. dollars, only to be told of the 
tax when I got to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
And some passengers have missed flights because they had run out of money 
before arriving at the airport to take a flight home. 
</P>
<P>
Or they have arrived at the last minute to catch their flight home, only to 
have to run to an airport bank to change their money back to local currency to 
make the departure tax payment. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the highest departure tax was imposed by Australia, which has 
charged a whopping $20 Australian (about $14 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
The Australian government collects millions of dollars each year from people 
leaving the country. Still, the revenue was not received without hundreds of 
complaints by travelers through the Australian Tourist Commission. 
</P>
<P>
After five years of fighting, the commission thought it had won the battle when 
late last year the Australian government announced that the unpopular tax would 
be removed. 
</P>
<P>
It was to be replaced by a ticket tax, imposed only on tickets written in 
Australia, therefore primarily affecting Australian residents. 
</P>
<P>
But just as suddenly, the order was reversed, and the government announced that 
it would keep the controversial tax. The only difference was that the tax would 
be collected by the airlines instead of the government. 
</P>
<P>
One piece of good news: The current charge has dropped to about $10 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passenger Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Complaints also have been lodged by passengers connecting from other countries 
who had to stay overnight at Narita Airport because of airplane schedules. They 
are required to pay a departure tax, whereas the tax for overnight stay at 
other Japan airports is not required. 
</P>
<P>
The departure tax in Barbados rose over the years from $6 to $10, and then two 
years ago to $16 Barbados (or about $8 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
In Jamaica, the departure tax is $80 Jamaican or $16 U.S., double what it was 
just a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases the tax is quietly included in the price of travel packages. As a 
result, many people traveling to Jamaica never even know that they have paid a 
hefty departure tax. 
</P>
<P>
Not every country has been able to successfully maintain a departure tax. About 
eight years ago, West Germany attempted to levy one. 
</P>
<P>
"It was short-lived," said a spokesman. "Opposition from the airlines, German 
residents and travelers was so strong that it practically started a 
revolution." The tax was removed. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines helped to defeat the German tax. After all, many passengers 
mistakenly assume that the airlines, not the governments, are charging the tax. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
International Tax 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, the airlines are certainly collecting the taxes. Most Americans 
don't know it, but a $3 international tax is included in the price of every 
ticket bought to a foreign destination. 
</P>
<P>
"Departure taxes are just something they have to live with," a spokesman for 
Pan Am said. "We don't like it, but we also can't control it." 
</P>
<P>
Some countries are so concerned about galloping inflation that they have also 
begun departure taxes aimed at their own citizens who are leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
Israel levies a 250-sheckel travel tax (about $175 U.S.) that every national 
must pay before leaving the country. 
</P>
<P>
Some countries have even tried to charge a form of arrival tax. For several 
years travelers landing in Egypt were required to buy at least $150 in local 
currency at airport banks before passing through customs. 
</P>
<P>
And the visitors were told to keep their exchange receipts if they hoped to 
convert their extra Egyptian pounds back to U.S. dollars at the end of their 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a Catch-22. In small print, or in some cases no print at all, was 
the regulation that required visitors to spend at least $30 worth of Egyptian 
pounds for each day they were in the country. Credit-card purchases didn't 
count. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many departing Americans made the painful discovery at the Cairo 
airport that they couldn't exchange their Egyptian money, that their original 
exchange receipt was meaningless and that their pounds had suddenly become an 
unexpected souvenir of their trip. In effect, they had paid an arrival tax and 
a departure tax. 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, the Egyptians have eliminated the $150 purchase requirement. But 
exchanging money at the end of a trip can still be a problem. Warning in Egypt: 
Only exchange dollars for Egyptian pounds as you need them during your stay, or 
make credit-card purchases. It will make leaving the country that much easier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Entrance Fee Proposal 
</P>
<P>
For a number of years, bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress to 
charge an entrance fee into the United States. Under one proposed plan, 
international travelers and returning citizens would be required to pay a $5 
"user fee." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a form of 'double duty,' " one angry travel agent said. "In addition, if 
you think there are long lines getting through customs now, just think what it 
will be like if this goes into effect."

TRAVELER'S DIARY: VACATIONERS' LOVE COAST 
</P>

LA BAULE, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We have had the Cote d'Azur and the Costa Brava, to say nothing of the Costa 
Smeralda, playground of the Aga Khan. Now it's the Cote d'Amour -- the Love 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The Cote d'Amour is the name given to the sandy stretch that rims the southern 
coast of Brittany barely five miles from St. Nazaire, the shipbuilding port 
where the Nazis maintained a nest of U-boats that preyed on Allied shipping 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
It has a museum now, and the submarine pens are still intact, but otherwise it 
is all sunshine and sailing on this stretch of coast that somehow has been 
overlooked by North Americans. All that is certain to change by early fall when 
the TGV, the fast French train, will trim the travel time from Paris to two 
hours (from four). 
</P>
<P>
If Americans have overlooked this sparkling strand, the French and a few other 
Europeans have not. Its three-mile beach snuggles the Atlantic Ocean and is 
lined with condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hotels With Style 
</P>
<P>
Hotels of style and personality are also in evidence, among them the 
fashionable L'Hermitage, the small Castel Marie-Louise and the broad-shouldered 
Royal, connected by a passageway to the glittering glass box that encloses the 
curative spa called Thalgo La Baule. 
</P>
<P>
Opened just a year, the Thalgo is all glass pyramids, glass elevators, 
stainless-steel trim and pale green walls. It treats rheumatism, cardiovascular 
problems, circulatory problems, stress and sports injuries year round and even 
touts a cure for smoking. 
</P>
<P>
In front of the glass-block Thalgo sits a casino that opened this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Built before the turn of the century when La Baule emerged as a resort, the 
Royal casino, set in pine trees, has 103 rooms. They rent for a minimum of $50 
per person double, except in July and August when the rate rises to $62. The 
price includes breakfast and, like other Barriere-group hotels such as 
L'Hermitage and the Marie-Louise, it includes golf, tennis, horseback riding 
and wind-surfing. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny Castel Marie-Louise, which is also a member of the Relais-Chateau, has 
31 rooms for $50 per person, except mid-June to mid-September when the minimum 
garden-view room is about $80 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast here is an extra $10. The Castel has had a Michelin star for more 
than a dozen years. Its menu includes: paper-thin slices of marinated bass and 
salmon, a scallop of trout with grapefruit sabayon and, its signature dish, a 
fricassee of lobster in a tomato cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seawater Pool 
</P>
<P>
L'Hermitage also has a seawater pool sitting between its back door and the 
beach. Meals are served on shaded terraces, in the bar and restaurant and in a 
formal dining room. 
</P>
<P>
Approximate cost is a minimum of $50 per person a day in May, June, September 
and October, and a base rate of $75 per person in July and August. Breakfast is 
an additional $10. For demi-pension or modified American plan, add another $62 
per person a day. 
</P>
<P>
All the action is by no means at the seaside hotels. 
</P>
<P>
By day, the open market dispenses everything from Brittany lace ($125 for a 
cloth about five feet in diameter, six-inch doilies at $6 each) to spider 
crabs, succulent langoustines, wild strawberries and kuign aman, a Breton 
upside-down cake. An eight-table restaurant, the Duo, serves a terrine of crab 
with avocado mousse and mushrooms stuffed with duck liver. 
</P>
<P>
The Tour de Pise (Tower of Pisa) prepares pasta in assorted colors.

JEFFERSON BUILT MONTICELLO WITH FRANCE IN MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This bicentennial year of the French Revolution may be the most fitting time to 
visit Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson, who witnessed the beginnings of the Revolution, spent only a few 
years in Paris, but France had a profound influence on his taste ever after. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a love affair in Paris may have contributed to the feature most 
associated with Monticello -- the wondrous dome that overlooks the verdant 
hills of central Virginia. It was the first dome erected over a private home in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
In 1786, Jefferson, then the American minister (or ambassador) in Paris, met 
Maria Cosway, a 27-year-old English-born, Italian-educated painter, at the 
Halle aux Bleds, the new and expansive grain market in central Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Its enormous dome was the architectural delight of the city. But Jefferson, a 
43-year-old widower, seemed at that time less interested in the dome than his 
new friend, whom he described later as "the most superb thing on earth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maria Went Home 
</P>
<P>
Biographers do not agree whether the friendship flamed into a love affair, but 
if so, it did not last very long. Maria returned to London with her husband 
after six weeks, then made another visit to Paris in 1787 for three months, but 
did not see Jefferson very often that time. 
</P>
<P>
Historians believe it significant that Jefferson, when he rebuilt Monticello 
after his return to the United States, modeled some aspects of the dome after 
the Halle aux Bleds. 
</P>
<P>
"Jefferson, in tearing down and rebuilding Monticello after the pattern of the 
place where he first met Maria Cosway," wrote Fawn M. Brodie, one of his 
biographers, "may have been unconsciously defining and redefining the ideal 
woman, which he had clearly not yet found in his own life." 
</P>
<P>
Monticello, a glorious legacy of early America, stands on an 867-foot hill a 
few miles east of Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, which 
Jefferson founded and designed. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists are always fascinated by the home, for its crannies and gadgets and 
art and design reflect all of Jefferson's intelligence and sensibility and 
attention to detail. It is an idyllic monument to the voracious curiosity and 
sweeping knowledge of a remarkable statesman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minister to France 
</P>
<P>
But visitors do not always understand the French influence fully. Jefferson 
represented the Continental Congress as minister to France from 1784 to 1789, 
during the transitional period between the end of the Revolution and the 
adoption of the Constitution. It was the only time in his life that Jefferson 
spent any time outside North America, and the future President was clearly 
enthralled by France and the French. 
</P>
<P>
"A more benevolent people I have never known," he wrote years later. "Nor 
greater warmth and devotedness in their select friendships. Their kindness and 
accommodation to strangers is unparalleled." 
</P>
<P>
French liberal friends like the Marquis de Lafayette tried to draw Jefferson 
into their politics of reform, for he was known throughout France as the author 
of the American Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jefferson resisted taking part, he did commute to Versailles 
frequently to hear the debates in the new National Assembly that was 
challenging the authority of King Louis XVI. He witnessed some of the major 
moments of the French Revolution, and heard firsthand accounts on the same day 
of other events, like the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson left Paris in late 1789, expecting to return, but soon accepted an 
appointment by President George Washington as the first secretary of state in 
the new American government under the Constitution. He never returned to 
France. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built in Two Phases 
</P>
<P>
Monticello was built in two phases. Although it was still unfinished when 
Jefferson left for France in 1784, it already impressed visiting Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Jefferson," wrote the Marquis de Chastellux, who had been a commander of 
the French army in America, "is the first American who has consulted the Fine 
Arts to know how he should shelter himself from the weather." 
</P>
<P>
The second phase began after Jefferson tired of Cabinet squabbling and resigned 
as secretary of state in 1795. Returning to Monticello, he redesigned the house 
and started to enlarge it from eight to 21 rooms, adapting many ideas from 
Parisian architecture and placing classical French art and exquisite French 
crafts throughout. 
</P>
<P>
"Were I to proceed to tell you how much I enjoy their architecture," Jefferson 
had written to a friend from France, ". . . I would want words." 
</P>
<P>
In his most dramatic change, Jefferson removed the second story of the original 
Monticello and set the distinctive octagonal dome upon it. Although his use of 
glass and wooden ribs followed the architectural principles of the Halle aux 
Bleds, Jefferson based the overall design of the dome on that of the Hotel de 
Salm, near his own Paris home on the Right Bank of the Seine. 
</P>
<P>
The Hotel de Salm, now the Palace of the Legion of Honor alongside the enormous 
Museum D'Orsay, was built during Jefferson's stay in Paris, and he told friends 
that he was "violently smitten" with it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other French Influences 
</P>
<P>
There are a host of other French influences in the Virginia house: the double 
tier of bedroom windows patterned after the pavilion in the Parc Monceau of 
Paris; the use of skylights over the dining room and main bedroom; sculptures 
by Jean Antoine Houdon bought directly from his studio in Paris; exquisite 
French clocks, including one made by Chantrot of Paris from Jefferson's design; 
lovely Parisian mirrors; a French portrait of Benjamin Franklin; a great number 
of Louis XVI chairs and other splendid furniture and goblets that Jefferson 
commissioned from Paris silversmiths. 
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that there are so many French furnishings. After Jefferson 
left Paris his assistant, William Short, shipped 86 cases of the future 
President's possessions from France to Virginia. Under Jefferson's injunction 
to leave anything unsuitable for America behind, Short did not pack five 
dumbwaiters and a few other items. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson also took a French chef with him to Virginia, and the dominant Gallic 
tone of the Monticello table and wine cellar was known throughout the new 
United States. After dinner in Monticello, Daniel Webster remarked that it had 
been "served half in Virginia, half in French style, in good taste and 
abundance." 
</P>
<P>
Although Jefferson's talents as an architect and designer were sometimes 
derided in the 19th Century, Monticello, after it was bought by the Thomas 
Jefferson Memorial Foundation in 1923 and restored, has become one of the most 
popular sites from early American history. It attracts upward of half a million 
visitors every year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Monticello is open every day except Christmas. Hours 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. except 
during winter, when the home opens half an hour later and closes half an hour 
earlier. Visitors are guided through the home. Prices: adults $7, seniors $6, 
children 6 through 11, $2.

My lady and I recently toured Spain by car and had reserved a budget-econobox, 
a Ford Escort 1.3, from Hertz in Madrid. The first surprise was being told that 
particular car would not be available for our rental: Hertz quietly upgraded us 
to a larger, faster, four-door 1.6 liter model at no extra charge. The second 
surprise was receiving the bill based on Hertz Affordable Europe rate: We had 
the car for 16 days, drove 1,800 miles, yet the total came to only $430. 
</P>
<P>
This week I received the following letter from Hertz: 
</P>
<P>
"A review of our records indicates that the currency exchange rate applied on 
your rental was incorrectly computed at the time of check-in. 
</P>
<P>
"Recomputing the exchange rate allows us to credit your account $5.71. A refund 
check will be sent within two to three weeks. Please accept our apology for 
this error." 
</P>
<P>
If Hertz has a favorite charity, it has just earned $5.71. 
</P>
<P>
If Hertz is interested in rental loyalty for a lifetime, it has mine.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Travel Section is my favorite reading of the week. Doublefold then was my 
shock and disgust at the tasteless article by Andrew Marton, "A Scandalous Tour 
of Washington" (July 16). Has the Travel Section stooped to trash and scandal 
techniques as TV and yellow journalism (have)? I hope not. The article has no 
place in (the) wholesome, intellectual, if you will, pursuit of normal American 
entertainment. We look to the Travel Section for enjoyment and helpful tips on 
places to go, what to see. Not this trash. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that Jerry Hulse, Judith Morgan, Peter Greenberg and (Bob) O'Sullivan 
will continue their valuable contributions to our enjoyment and that you will 
leave the above to the scandal rags.

The aptly named Hawk Mountain Sanctuary is the best place in the country to 
view hawks en masse. 
</P>
<P>
There are two routes to the wintering grounds for these predators of Eastern 
Canada and the Northeast United States -- along the Atlantic Coast, and down 
the Appalachian Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The inland-traveling birds catch the air currents to ride away from winter. 
They do this in the same manner as a surfer contemplates, then slides aboard, a 
well-shaped wave. 
</P>
<P>
Hawk Mountain's location, near the terminus of what the Lenapi Indians called 
the "endless mountains," makes it about the last point at which the birds can 
catch a final, powerful comber toward the warmer southern climate. 
</P>
<P>
The route can be spectacular. On an autumn day in 1948, for example, 11,000 
broadwings, the most numerous species every year, were counted in their fly-by. 
This number is rarely equaled, but several thousand a day is not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Hawk Mountain so attractive to the birds is the bowl formed by its 
ridges and the flat farmland surrounding it. 
</P>
<P>
The cupped configuration is like a sea wall on which the surf breaks and 
thrusts upward. And the heat boiling out of the sun-warmed fields generates 
great currents upon which the hawks can elevate. 
</P>
<P>
The word "boil" is used by hawkers interchangeably with "kettle," and describes 
the phenomenon of the birds as they collectively ascend a geyser of air. 
</P>
<P>
They spiral effortlessly, ever higher, until the lift dies out. They may then 
sweep over to another, higher current to gain even more altitude. Or, if the 
height is adequate, they may take a southward heading and shoot away for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The season for hawks and hawkers begins in late August when the broadwings 
begin to show. September is a very heavy month and, historically, Sept. 11-24 
is the best time to watch the raptors pass in review. 
</P>
<P>
There are always birds, however, from mid-August through early December, and 
the rare bald eagle appears in early September. Golden eagles, equally 
impressive but fewer in number, fly past in early November. 
</P>
<P>
Becoming a hawker requires no particular expertise. Michael Harwood's book "The 
View From Hawk Mountain" is a good start for feather-and-beak data and a little 
romance. 
</P>
<P>
"Feathers in the Wind" also is a good one. It's on sale at Hawk Mountain 
headquarters, offering tips plus a lot of interesting esoterica. 
</P>
<P>
The book also explains what a hawker means when he yells: "Bird over No. 3!" 
No. 3 is one of the series of five small, consecutively numbered points on a 
ridge directly before the North Lookout. 
</P>
<P>
They're indispensable observation points, but awkwardly are numbered from right 
to left. However, once a hawker gets used to it, the spotting is simple. 
</P>
<P>
The walk to the North Lookout is about half an hour up a lovely rough forest 
path that ends in a tumble of stone about 1,000 feet above the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
The view takes in 30 miles in all directions, which alone is worth the hike. 
For the more tender of foot, the South Lookout is five minutes from the 
highway. It requires less exertion, but offers less viewing opportunity, too. 
</P>
<P>
The ambience around Hawk Mountain has not always been so receptive to the 
birds. It might well have been called "Massacre Mountain" in the past, due to 
the thousands of birds slaughtered from what is now the North Lookout. 
</P>
<P>
Old-timers say that during the migration the stench of rotting birds was almost 
unbearable. But hunters had no problem putting up with it: hawks were 
predators. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, conservationists won the day when, in 1932, it became the world's 
first sanctuary for birds of prey. 
</P>
<P>
Hawks, it seems, are not just birds. Mythology associates them with death and a 
terrible aloofness. The dark side of man responds with a primeval, feral, 
growling acclaim to the frightening wonder of a killer for sport. 
</P>
<P>
Eagles, however, eat things already dead and rotting. Some hawks subsist mainly 
on things as yucky as toads. But legends die hard, and the supreme arrogance of 
the rapacious raptor -- lethal, amoral and totally without conscience -- is 
something to which we all may be drawn. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Hawk Mountain is about a two-hour drive northwest of Philadelphia. Take the 
Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike just outside Philadelphia, 
turn left at the Allentown exit and follow the signs to Kempton about 15 miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
A day at Hawk Mountain can include a journey through the Pennsylvania Dutch 
pleasantness of rural Berks County. 
</P>
<P>
Reading, the major community, is accessible from the Morgantown exit of the 
Pennsylvania Turnpike. 
</P>
<P>
Reading is the discount center of the Eastern Seaboard. The town calls itself 
"The Outlet Capital of the World" because of the 250-plus discount houses in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the approach to Reading is Hopewell Village. Known for its cast 
iron from which, among other things, came more than 65,000 stoves and a whole 
nation's worth of pots and pans. 
</P>
<P>
The National Park Service supervises Hopewell, and has restored it to the 
1820-1840 era, when Hopewell Village was most productive. 
</P>
<P>
Just north of Reading is the little town of Temple, from which the Blue 
Mountain &amp; Reading Railroad huffs and puffs its way up to North Hamburg and 
back in about 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The railroad uses an old steam locomotive, the kind that produced the smoke 
that used to outrage housewives when it settled on drying laundry and sifted 
into just-dusted homes. 
</P>
<P>
Also worth a visit, just outside Reading, is Roadside America. At a scale of 
three-eighths of an inch to the foot, the miniature villages, factories and 
farm towns trace 200 years of U.S. history. The magnitude of the undertaking is 
suggested by the numbers: 300 buildings, 10,000 trees, 4,000 people and 2,250 
feet of trolley and railroad tracks, all in miniature. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be missed, either, is the Crystal Cave at Kutztown, discovered in 1871. 
It takes about 35 minutes to tour through stalactite, stalagmite and dripstone 
formations. 
</P>
<P>
This fairyland of sculpted stone features such oddities as the Giant's Tooth, 
the Indian Head and the Crystal Ballroom. But take a sweater; the temperature's 
a constant 56 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Other attractions in Berks County are Daniel Boone's Homestead, the Boyertown 
Museum of Historic Vehicles, the Pennsylvania Dutch Folk Culture Center and the 
Maple Grove Auto Raceway. 
</P>
<P>

area), contact the Berks County Chamber of Commerce, P.O. Box 1698, Reading,

THE FUTURE OF POVERTY; 
</P>
<P>
A WOMAN WHO KNEW HARDSHIP KEEPS TRYING TO HELP OTHERS AS HUMAN SERVICES 
AGENCIES FACE OFF IN COMPETITION FOR DWINDLING FUNDS 
</P>

<P>
In 1967, Vera Davis was raising nine children in a Mar Vista housing project, 
living on a monthly welfare check. Davis, then 46, had spent eight years alone 
after the desertion of her alcoholic husband. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two years later, she has built a $385,000 nonprofit social agency for 
minorities and the elderly that provides one key strand in the Westside human 
service net. 
</P>
<P>
Yet stories like Davis', stories of compassion overcoming poverty, may be fewer 
and farther between as the 1980s draw to an end. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corporate Influence 
</P>
<P>
A period that marked the rise of corporate influence and concern for the bottom 
line in both public and private sectors, the last decade has seen nonprofit 
agency boardrooms become increasingly abuzz with phrases like "linkage," 
"visibility" and "service marketing." 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with dwindling public grants, increasing competition for funds 
between agencies and rising need among the poor, such agencies are hoping that 
massive new fund-raising efforts can fill the gap. 
</P>
<P>
At risk may be a philosophy promulgated in President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on 
Poverty in 1964: that the poor could best help themselves in their own 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The problem Davis and others face is this: given cutbacks, more scrutiny over 
how funds are spent and the struggle simply to obtain them, poor agencies must 
increasingly turn to private fund raising for help. Yet in the scramble for big 
donors, such agencies typically find themselves the most disadvantaged in the 
chase. 
</P>
<P>
For Davis, who already spends 80% of her occasional seven-day work weeks 
writing grant applications, the extra burden of fund raising may prove 
insurmountable. The answer she has reluctantly accepted is to subtly shift 
focus from the delivery of service to business management. 
</P>
<P>
"The nature of the nonprofit sector has changed," says Lola Coleman, manager of 
United Way of Los Angeles' Underserved Geographic Areas program in the 
South-Central district. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more, nonprofit organizations need to look more like profit 
organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Davis opened the Low-Income Elderly United Community Assistance Project in 
1983, gaining private status for a segment of a federally funded program begun 
in 1965 that was disbanding because of cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
LIEU-CAP, as Davis's group was known, drew from a philosophy that 
neighborhoods, given funding and training, could provide for their own needs 
with their own staffing and programs, in lieu of massive government or other 
outside assistance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poverty Pockets 
</P>
<P>
Directed at two poverty pockets in Santa Monica and Venice, LIEU-CAP works 
closely with elderly and minority residents, helping them with everyday 
problems such as paying bills, applying for government aid or getting food. 
</P>
<P>
The agency says it serves about 3,000 people a year with a staff of 12 and 
budget of $385,000, and it recently opened a shelter for homeless mothers and 
children in Venice. Santa Monica city officials say the group fills a critical 
service niche in the neighborhoods, primarily for elderly and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The directorship of LIEU-CAP is a familiar role for Davis, but it is on a scale 
larger than she could have imagined 15 years ago. Living at Mar Vista Gardens, 
Davis had spent years struggling with other mothers to raise her children. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, the daughter of a New Orleans nursing volunteer, began organizing her 
housing project in 1971, first by creating a children's recreation program and 
then forming a tenants' rights board. In following years, Davis would form 
community service groups in Mar Vista, then Santa Monica, before forming 
LIEU-CAP. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Role Model 
</P>
<P>
"I provide the service and I feel I'm beneficial because I can use myself as a 
role model," Davis says now, from her small Venice office. Hand-framed awards 
from churches, politicians and government offices testify to continued support 
for the self-sufficiency of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'm here. I know what the hardship is and I know the need," she 
says. "I know what it's like to be hungry. You have to go through these things 
in order to know." 
</P>
<P>
A recent Santa Monica City Council meeting dramatically revealed the problem 
facing LIEU-CAP and about 72,000 other California nonprofit service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, with about 20 elderly black women, sat patiently in the council's 
meeting hall at a budget hearing, waiting for their turn to appeal for the 
restoration to the agency of $9,000, which they say is crucial to its 
operation. But the crowd thinned as the meeting dragged on -- from 7:30 to past 
10 p.m. Many of the women simply could not stay awake longer. 
</P>
<P>
By 11:30 p.m., when her motion was heard, Davis was the only one left in her 
group. The city, citing lack of funds, denied her appeal. Hers was the last of 
dozens of requests by other groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Competition 
</P>
<P>
Three reasons lie behind the crunch: funding cuts, increased accountability to 
funding sources for existing resources, and rising competition among agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly, all nonprofit agencies are trying to get a fund-raising capacity 
built in," said Stephanie Klopfleisch, director of the Los Angeles County 
Department of Community and Senior Citizens Services. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, funds for the community service block grant program -- the major 
federal source for state and local programs for the poor -- have been cut about 
40% since 1980, from about $50 million to $30 million for California, and from 
$6 million to $3.5 million in Los Angeles County, say state and county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many cities have placed more stringent demands on agencies 
applying for the remaining funds, as that responsibility passed from federal 
hands to local governments under the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical Questions 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when you got a flat-out, take-out grant," Coleman says. Now, 
"accountability has gotten more critical. The major funding sources are 
beginning to ask more critical questions, which in some ways has cut back the 
number of dollars an agency can count on in a pinch." 
</P>
<P>
For example, LIEU-CAP, which in 1988 got $104,000 from Santa Monica, recently 
gave up 12% of that sum for 1989 because it failed to show it could secure a 
level of private support recently mandated by the city. That new requirement, 
intended to ensure the independence of funded agencies, reduces the share of 
agencies' budgets the city will pay, from 80% down to 50% by 1991. The 
remaining money must be raised from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
The adoption of such measures by most funding sources squeezes groups like 
LIEU-CAP, which draws virtually all of its funds from the cities of Santa 
Monica and Los Angeles, and from Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
But even as cities attempt to better manage limited dollars, the problems of 
the poor are worsening. Nationally, their numbers have increased and since 
1979, living standards have fallen for the poorest segment of the population. A 
House Ways and Means Committee report this March showed that the lowest fifth 
of American households suffered a 9% decline in their standard of living this 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inadequate Resources 
</P>
<P>
Locally, agency and city officials say, groups have formed or expanded to 
address the problem, but they find themselves competing for inadequate 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
The financial impact has hit hardest, ironically, on the poorest agencies 
serving the poorest communities -- on agencies like LIEU-CAP. 
</P>
<P>
"For some agencies that have put most emphasis on the providing of services -- 
and were very constrained about the number of people and staff put into 
administration -- it's very much of a challenge and almost a nightmare going 
through the (funding) contract process," says Rhonda Meister, director of the 
St. Joseph Center for the homeless in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond its limited human resources, LIEU-CAP stands out starkly because it 
is a small agency serving a predominantly minority community, still reliant 
upon its War on Poverty, poor-helping-the-poor roots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Access to the Wealthy 
</P>
<P>
"Any smaller agency usually has a tougher time fund raising because they don't 
have access to two groups of people who are very successful at it," corporate 
officials and the wealthy, Coleman says. 
</P>
<P>
Working out of minority neighborhoods only exacerbates the challenge, since 
such communities typically have no access to wealthy donors and would be 
ill-equipped to proceed with soliciting funds even if they had, Coleman says. 
</P>
<P>
Further, such neighborhood groups are squeezed when -- relying on community 
volunteers for staff -- worsening poverty means there will be less qualified 
and fewer available volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"The effort in terms of community basing and hiring (from the community) is 
changing because our poor communities are truly poorer than they were," Coleman 
says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Market Services 
</P>
<P>
"When there were a lot of dollars available, it was really easy. . . . Now 
we're talking about scarcer resources, and we have to have the expertise to 
remain competitive, and we must market our agencies and services." she says. 
"Most minority agencies in Los Angeles County don't do a good job at that." 
</P>
<P>
The result is an evolution toward survival of the financially fittest. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to compete," says Davis. "The rise in the economy has led to more 
poor. It's worse." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, accepting what increasingly seems to be inevitable, last year brought 
aboard a group of experienced fund raisers, willing to volunteer their time -- 
and contacts -- for the ordinarily low-profile minority communities on the 
Westside. It was a step she had resisted for years -- thinking good work should 
bring its own reward, friends say. 
</P>
<P>
In its first year, the nine-member board -- consisting of six new members 
specially commissioned for the task -- increased fund-raising revenue 
seven-fold through personal appeals, an auction and a special dinner. Although 
the sum that was raised, about $21,000, is still only about 5.5% of the 
agency's annual budget, Davis and other directors expect the figure to jump 
even higher in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Pressure Now 
</P>
<P>
But the gains have not come without cost, both to programs and in the direction 
of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more pressure on you now, that you have to raise this money now," says 
Helen Reid, who is in charge of LIEU-CAP's Santa Monica office. Reid's office 
has given up holding community lunches and planning meetings two afternoons a 
week so that staff could draft reports to satisfy funders' requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that working with the board has sometimes led to battles over 
defining jobs and responsibilities, and that she must keep a long-range view of 
how to spend limited resources. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a day and time when everybody has to have a product and a client base 
and you have to be able to market," says Daniel Bakewell, executive director of 
the Brotherhood Crusade, a multimillion-dollar black-oriented service 
organization in Los Angeles. The agency disperses funds to other organizations, 
in addition to running its own programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Run a Tight Ship 
</P>
<P>
"We run a business at the Brotherhood Crusade -- our business is about being 
sensitive human beings, but we run a very, very tight ship." To Bakewell, that 
means helping people more efficiently -- and raising dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, Davis' struggle will be a barometer of the changing climate 
for nonprofit social agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But whether her group ultimately succeeds or fails, the question is how the 
service providers balance compassion for their communities with financial 
constraints. 
</P>
<P>
That answer may determine whether the future picture of service workers will 
include faces like Davis'. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improving Relations 
</P>
<P>
For Julie Mulvaney, one of six new LIEU-CAP board members who has several years 
of experience in raising money and as an assistant to former county supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, the issue is simply making both funding sources and 
Davis "more flexible." 
</P>
<P>
That means improving relations with city bureaucrats, meeting funders' requests 
and better articulating LIEU-CAP's goals and successes. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis and others see another result. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole reason the Brotherhood exists is we know if people are running a 
child-care center or drug-prevention center, they need to give all their energy 
to running that child-care center or drug-prevention center, all they can 
muster," says Bakewell. 
</P>
<P>
"It just stands to reason if you have to do more than one thing, a person who 
does just one thing will do it better." 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, it's a big struggle especially for low-income people," 
says Davis. "It burns you out."

SANTA MONICA PUTS CREATIVITY IN CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developer of a six-story, 93,000-square-foot office building in Santa 
Monica was in danger of not getting his project approved because the building 
would exceed its daily limit on waste water by 1,858 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was resolved when the developer, Search Builders Inc., agreed to 
replace old toilets at a school with new toilets that use less water, in effect 
offsetting the excess sewage discharged by the project. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the City Council adopted an ordinance requiring all construction to 
include low-flow toilets and shower heads. Now, as incentive to have the more 
efficient fixtures installed in all existing residences, the city is willing to 
pay property owners $100 per bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Those are just two innovative ways Santa Monica is trying to reduce water 
consumption at a time when the future of the state's water supply is uncertain, 
and demand is overburdening the Los Angeles Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Monica has a water conservation ethic more than other communities," said 
Ed Thornhill, water conservation manager for the Metropolitan Water District, 
which supplies water to 15 million people from Ventura to the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Says Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane: "I think it is fair to say that the city 
is taking the leadership in developing an environmental policy. We feel we have 
an obligation to do our share of addressing the problem of bay pollution. In 
our judgment, it is the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Most cities in the Southland have some voluntary water conservation measures, 
most of which were first implemented during the 1977-78 drought. Some cities 
have even taken part in Metropolitan Water District pilot programs, including 
residential water audits and leak detection services. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, recognizing that the city's construction boom was dumping too much 
sewage into the Hyperion treatment plant, last year made many emergency water 
conservation measures mandatory, including a ban on washing down sidewalks and 
driveways, forcing restaurants to serve water only on request and requiring 
property owners to fix leaky faucets and toilets. 
</P>
<P>
The city also required the installation of low-flow shower heads and 
toilet-tank displacement devices in all homes. The shower heads and plastic 
bags for toilet tanks were distributed free to property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles also is limiting building permits to reduce development to about 
30% of last year's pace. The city has been unable to force surrounding cities 
that dump into Hyperion to adopt similar restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica, which has led the nation with other innovative public policy 
matters such as rent control, hopes to go a step beyond Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the City Council made permanent most of its water conservation 
measures -- many similar to those adopted by Los Angeles -- and extended for 
another year its 1.36% limit on yearly sewage increases. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are expected to come up with permanent restrictions within a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they are looking for creative ways to allow development without 
overloading the sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
Developments of more than 100,000 square feet must provide on-site water 
treatment facilities. Both the Water Garden and Colorado Place projects, office 
and retail complexes that each are over a million square feet, are building 
such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
For smaller projects, city staff members have been looking for ways to offset 
new sewage by reducing the waste water of existing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Atossa Soltani, Santa Monica's conservation coordinator, said the city recently 
was able to achieve that goal with Search Builders' project. 
</P>
<P>
Soltani said the builders of the Security Pacific Courtyard office project at 
Arizona Avenue and 4th Street paid about $30,000 to replace the toilets at Will 
Rogers School with low-flow models. 
</P>
<P>
"In this particular case, the city has been reasonable," said Todd Calish, vice 
president of design and construction for Search Builders. "It shows that it 
isn't necessary to cut back on development to achieve a reduction in waste 
water uses." 
</P>
<P>
"This is one way developers can meet no-net sewage growth," said Councilwoman 
Christine Reed. "This particular program works because not only do they get new 
fixtures, the schools save money with a lower water bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are making a conscious effort in the city to be a good example to 
our residents. My own personal view is that you can't preach water conservation 
unless you have the wherewithal to address your personal practices and your 
municipal practices." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the City Council will consider spurring replacement of the 
water-guzzling toilets with low-flow toilets by providing financial incentives 
to owners of homes and apartment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Metropolitan Water District estimates, 45% of all household water 
is flushed down toilets. Bathing accounts for another 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's goal is to retrofit bathroom fixtures in at least 25% of the 
11,400 single-family homes and 36,500 multifamily households over five years. 
At the end of five years about 936 acre-feet of water could be saved annually 
-- or about 835,200 gallons per day. 
</P>
<P>
Toilets installed before 1981 use five to seven gallons per flush on average, 
and older shower heads consume an average of four to six gallons per minute. 
That compares with new ultra-low-flow toilets which use a maximum of 1.6 
gallons per flush and low-flow shower heads that consume a maximum of three 
gallons per minute. 
</P>
<P>
The program offers a $100 rebate for each bathroom retrofitted, but imposes a 
surcharge on customers' water bills until all water-wasting bathroom fixtures 
are replaced. Beginning April 1, 1990, each homeowner who has not installed the 
new toilets will be charged $1 a month, and each apartment owner 65 cents per 
unit during the first year. 
</P>
<P>
The surcharge may be adjusted in subsequent years depending on response to the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
To promote the plan, the city would give away 1,000 free toilets on a 
first-come, first-serve basis (limit one toilet per property owner). The 
low-flow toilets retail from $99 to $250. 
</P>
<P>
Tank dams, displacement bags and other water-reducing devices would not qualify 
as substitutions for the ultra low-flow toilets. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that homeowners can recoup their costs in 9 1/2 to 21 
months, depending on whether the fixtures are installed by a plumber or a 
homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
For apartment owners, the pay-back period ranges from nearly 11 months to two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which would begin Oct. 1 if approved, is budgeted at nearly $2.9 
million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
The city would pay for the program from the surcharge, general water revenues 
and a grant from the Metropolitan Water District, the city's major water 
supplier. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing would include billing inserts, flyers, displays at plumbing and 
home-improvement stores, newspaper ads and radio announcements. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that apartment owners may be reluctant to participate in the 
program because of the costs involved, officials would emphasize a reduction in 
water and sewer bills, a reduction in material costs with the rebates and free 
demonstrations and do-it-yourself installation training. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the program will be successful," said the Metropolitan Water 
District's Thornhill. "We're hoping other communities see how successful the 
program is in Santa Monica and will adopt it." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Reed agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a population that values the ocean and the environment," she said. "Our 
population wants to make the bay better. We would be hypocritical if we were 
not doing what we are doing."

CAMP OFFERS YOUTHS A NON-COMPETITIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Wade is less than five feet tall, yet he's preparing for a place as point 
guard on an NBA basketball team. That may not be impossible. Eric is 10 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the past four summers, he has spent a month of mornings at Cal State 
Northridge's Summer Youth Fitness and Sports Camp, a 25-year-old nonprofit, 
program for 7- to 12-year-old boys and girls. 
</P>
<P>
The camp isn't designed to turn youngsters into superstars but to provide a 
noncompetitive learning environment, said William J. Vincent, director of the 
camp and a CSUN faculty member. Every day, the children rotate through four 
classes on the campus: swimming, which ranges from basic instruction for 
non-swimmers to diving and water safety; gymnastics; games, such as 
shuffleboard, jump rope, handball and kick ball; and other sports, including 
volleyball, basketball and soccer. Badminton, tennis and golf are taught the 
older children. 
</P>
<P>
Staffed by CSUN's Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education faculty and 
community teachers, the camp is committed to teaching those with perceptual 
motor problems or medical disabilities as well as those who already excel in 
sports, Vincent said. Students are recruited through flyers and brochures sent 
to local schools. 
</P>
<P>
The staff focuses on the "total person concept: helping the students learn 
cooperation and social skills and building self-esteem and self-image," Vincent 
said. As soon as children start doing well on the playground -- having the 
motor coordination, strength and skill to play typical games and sports -- they 
feel more self-confident and make friends more easily, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Cratty, program director of the Center for the Improvement of Physical 
Coordination in West Los Angeles and professor of kinesiology at UCLA, said 
there are three types of self-esteem in children: social, intellectual and 
physical ability. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skill on Playground 
</P>
<P>
He said studies show that by increasing a child's physical ability, his 
intellectual self-esteem can rise too. Gifted children and those with learning 
disabilities are often what he terms awkward, and the tack to take is to do 
what you can to help them improve their coordination and skill on the 
playground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The CSUN program provides basic assessment as well as coordination and skill 
training, Vincent said. It offers posture analysis with a written evaluation to 
parents, a screening system for such divergences as scoliosis (lateral 
curvature of the spine), knock knee (when the child stands with the knees 
together and the ankles do not meet) and bowlegs. 
</P>
<P>
The camp also administers a national fitness test that checks for 
cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, overall endurance and body fat 
percentage. The results are computer-generated and recorded, and returning 
students can compare their past records each year. Both tests are valuable 
because they are not usually offered in public or private schools, Vincent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most students who attend the camp are from nearby because there is no 
transportation available through the program. At least 50% of the 200 students 
have attended in previous years, Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Survey 
</P>
<P>
According to Denise Austin, a consultant to the President's Council on Physical 
Education and Sports, a council survey showed that "90% of all children ages 6 
to 12 fail the presidential sports tests. And 90% can't do one chin-up. Only 
one-sixth of all boys who take the test can do 40 sit-ups in one minute, and a 
study in 'The Physician and Sports Medicine Journal' estimated that 15% to 25% 
of U.S. schoolchildren are obese." 
</P>
<P>
Austin said the decrease in physical ability has taken place just since 1974, 
when more rigorous physical education routines were still budgeted in most of 
the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James G. Garrick, an orthopedic surgeon and director of the Center for 
Sports Medicine at St. Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, said, "The 
fitness levels of children and adolescents have been declining for over two 
decades." 
</P>
<P>
The decreased availability of education dollars makes changing physical 
education programs in the schools an unrealistic goal, Garrick said. He favors 
"an enhancement of extra-scholastic youth sports programs and increased 
education and pressure from parents and the medical profession." 
</P>
<P>
As for participants in the CSUN program, Merrill Hardy, professor of physical 
education at CSUN and the swimming teacher at the Youth Fitness and Sports 
Camp, said they are a fairly homogeneous group, but "a lot of parents have 
their kids in the program because they are less fit, less coordinated than 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Hardy does not think that the decrease in children's fitness levels would come 
as a surprise to anyone. Television, videotapes and games have turned them into 
couch potatoes, and physical education has become increasingly a part-time 
elective at most junior and senior high schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Develop Basic Skills 
</P>
<P>
The key in extracurricular programs, such as CSUN's, is to develop basic 
movement skills in children so they can succeed and truly enjoy athletics and 
sports, beginning at as early an age as possible, Hardy said. "Kids who don't 
move successfully don't tend to exercise," he said. The CSUN camp started, in 
fact, as a demonstration school for elementary school education, an attempt to 
show CSUN students and the community an ideal approach to teaching fitness. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy suggests that "parents look for programs that offer these kinds of 
opportunities for kids, such as the Department of Parks and Recreation programs 
-- at local parks -- and the YMCA." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent warns against signing children up for such sports as T-Ball and soccer 
too quickly. Not only may parents be limiting the range of choices a child may 
make regarding his favorite activities, but the competitive, organized sports 
tend to attract the cream of the crop. Youngsters with motor weakness or the 
need for skill training may be left on the bench, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy recommends that parents limit television to a specific hour of the day, 
and that they suggest or require 30 minutes a day of physical activity. 
"Parents are short-changing their kids if they don't help them find one to two 
things they will really enjoy doing athletically, to have the opportunity to 
succeed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing their parents enjoying an activity does more than anything to get kids 
interested in fitness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The camp costs $260 for a one-month session of half-day classes held five 
mornings a week. There is one teacher for every 12 children at the session, 
which is in July. For information about next year's enrollment, call (818) 
885-2661.

MORE AND MORE BABY BOOMERS CRY OUT, 'BINGO!'; 
</P>
<P>
OLD-TIMERS SHARE PRIZES, EXCITEMENT WITH YOUNGER SET

They arrive at the cavernous bingo halls in packs of three and four, talking in 
low tones about inside frames, outside corners and the ultimate -- a blackout. 
But these aren't the studious grandmothers of the past who sat for hours 
playing the game in linoleum-floored social halls. 
</P>
<P>
In increasing numbers, the folks who roar "BINGO!" are under 40 -- sometimes 
not young enough to remember when the church game was played with pinto beans. 
</P>
<P>
"To win the money. That's why I go," said Debbie Machanic, a manicurist who 
began playing last year with co-workers at the Nail Shop in Northridge. "It's 
just like going to Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
Machanic, 32, said bingo provides a break from going to bars or "just sitting 
in a movie -- and it's not that expensive. I come out ahead -- most of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's the Anticipation' 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks only old people play," said Tammy Phelps, 31, who works with 
Machanic and began playing when her mother invited her to a game two years ago. 
"It's exciting -- it's the anticipation, when you get down to just one number." 
</P>
<P>
Most bingo hall managers interviewed said between 15% and 40% of their crowds, 
which will be limited to 350 for each session by a law that goes into effect 
Aug. 1, consist of players under 40. Youthful players have increased in number 
over the past five years, and most are blue-collar workers who try to boost 
their incomes, the managers said. 
</P>
<P>
Many younger players said the game provides a less hectic alternative to 
singles bars and parties, although most concentrate too much on the game to 
actively look for dates. Others like the game's gambling aspect, and some 
became regulars after Mom invited them along one Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go and play bingo and spend what you spend in a bar or theater," said 
Steve Montgomery, co-owner and editor of Bingo Bugle, begun six years ago in 
Sun Valley as a newspaper for enthusiasts. The paper lists games and runs 
columns such as "Dear Aunt Bingo" and "Bingo by the Stars." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of younger people stop off on their way home from work. When the 
freeways are packed, they'll stop and play a game until the traffic dies down," 
Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All Ages 
</P>
<P>
"They take it very seriously," said Sam Potter, manager of Lankershim Bingo in 
North Hollywood, managed by Big Brothers of Greater Los Angeles and CRI-HELP, a 
North Hollywood treatment center for drug abusers. Potter said he noticed more 
younger players at the games as recently as three years ago. "Maybe a third of 
the crowd is under 40, but we get people of all ages, starting at 18 years." 
</P>
<P>
There are about 40 bingo halls in the San Fernando Valley, where players are 
given colored sheets of paper containing from one to six bingo faces or 
squares. To win, all the squares must be blocked out in winning patterns, such 
as diagonal rows, four corners, crosses or Xs. 
</P>
<P>
Younger players say the methodical, nearly Zen-like feel of the game -- 
produced as players fiercely concentrate on cards and bingo numbers resound 
through hushed halls -- is what keeps them coming back. 
</P>
<P>
"I play to calm my nerves," said Mary Rocco, 28, who lives in North Hollywood 
and began playing with her parents a decade ago. "When I'm stressed out, I play 
bingo. I just concentrate on the numbers and winning. It sort of clears my 
mind. But I haven't won in two years -- a long time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Socializing 
</P>
<P>
Rocco, who works as a bartender, said she finds little time to socialize at the 
halls. "Your mind is just on the numbers and trying to win. It's pretty much an 
individual game." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Amaral began playing three years ago when a female friend invited him to a 
game. "When I heard you could win $250, that just put dollar signs in my eyes," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Amaral, 34, who works as a shipping and receiving supervisor, said he wins 
about $500 a month from sessions played twice each week. "So far this year, I 
figure I'm ahead by about $343. I've met a lot of friends through bingo. I've 
met girls at games, but I haven't gotten personally involved -- not yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do anything else. Without bingo, I'm not having fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Cassady, 34, has met "several very nice young women at bingo." Cassady, 
who works as a printer, began playing two years ago when his mother introduced 
him to Lankershim Bingo. "Some of the women are married or have steady 
boyfriends, but there are a lot of single women there. We make arrangements to 
meet at the hall and then go out to eat afterward down the block." 
</P>
<P>
To either side of Cassady, fellow players sat at long rows of Formica tables, 
hunched over cards they scanned with fluorescent markers. Several younger men, 
who wore ties and cowboy boots, were scattered among pastel leisure suits worn 
by older players. Some munched on ham sandwiches and chips sold at the "Bingo 
Buffet" and read snatches from popular novels between games. Others caught 
glimpses of sports on portable TVs or listened to the action through radio 
earphones. 
</P>
<P>
Arranged in front of many players were talismans in the form of miniature 
plastic statues of Garfield, Buddha and a few California Raisins. Older players 
favored teddy bears, horseshoes -- even a Bible opened to the book of 
Revelation. Some fingered rosary beads, and others meditated or said quick 
prayers while fingering holy cards of St. Jude. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chatting Between Games 
</P>
<P>
Four older women huddled over a trough of macaroni and cheese at the "Bingo 
Buffet" near the rear of the Lankershim Bingo hall, chatting about "lousy 
cards," "long dry spells," and "I needed a 'G-57' in the last game, not this 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Some younger players kept to themselves and sat in groups discussing favorite 
talismans, such as squares of plastic used to magnify desired numbers on cards. 
</P>
<P>
Bingo was legalized in 1976 by an amendment to the state Constitution and in 
1977, United Cerebral Palsy opened the state's first bingo hall in Van Nuys. 
Church games doling out $25 to $50 in prize money were illegal before 1977, 
although the games were widespread and common. State law now limits prize money 
to $250 per game with a limit of 40 games per session. Proceeds from bingo must 
be donated to charity, and most halls charge from $10 to $25 for sessions 
consisting of from 15 to 40 games. 
</P>
<P>
Indian bingo, played on Indian reservations throughout the country, has also 
become increasingly popular among younger players. The game doles out larger 
prize amounts, usually from $1,000 to $2,000 per game, because reservations are 
exempt from state regulations that apply to other bingo halls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Energy in the Air 
</P>
<P>
"There's more energy in the air," said Mark Sammon, general manager of San 
Manuel Indian Bingo, played on the San Manuel Indian Reservation in San 
Bernardino. "Maybe it has to do with the amount of money on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
Sammon said his games award about $500,000 per week and attract 2,500 people 
per game, most of whom are shuttled in free by Indian bingo halls from outlying 
areas, including communities in Los Angeles County. Sammon estimates 30% of his 
players are under 40. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest draw for younger players of the Indian bingo circuit is 
"Megabingo," played via satellite in 14 bingo halls across the country for $5 a 
game. The first person to fill up the "B" row on their cards in each hall wins 
$1,000. The game then progresses until a player blacks out his entire card, 
netting $500,000, should he complete the task before 50 numbers are called. 
</P>
<P>
"This is attracting people who have never played before," said Jack Salinger, 
general manager of Morongo Bingo, which features Megabingo during most sessions 
played on the Morongo Indian Reservation in Cabazon, in Riverside County. 
"Husbands can now go play bingo and win more than they would playing poker. 
That's helping draw new crowds at local games too." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Sunshine began playing Indian bingo eight months ago when some friends 
invited her to a game. She has since won about $2,200. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monetary Attraction 
</P>
<P>
"Once people hear of a game that pays out $100,000, I think there's an element 
of excitement," said Sunshine, 36, who lives in Woodland Hills and works as an 
administrator for a computer firm. "It's a new adventure for people who have 
never played before. You go one time and you get hooked." 
</P>
<P>
Many say the chance aspect of the game keeps them returning to bingo halls week 
after week. "To me, it's addicting, it's like gambling," Lynn Messine, 26, said 
as she ripped off a sheet of bingo games and poised her marker for a new game 
at Lankershim Bingo. "I go three or four times a week and I win constantly." 
Messine, who cares for her three children full time in Sunland, said she wins 
about $500 per month. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't won in two years," said her mother, Carol Krueger, 50, a Sun Valley 
waitress who introduced her two daughters to the game seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For some older patrons, the game has been a lifelong pursuit. "Right now it's 
the only recreation I have," said Nora Nolter, 75, a former secretary who has 
been playing for 50 years and now lives in Panorama City. "If they ever stop 
bingo, I'd be very unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've noticed more younger people coming in. They're a lot more lucky. And more 
men, too, but they should stay home and watch the kids -- leave bingo to the 
women." 
</P>
<P>
Other players claim that the game provides a form of exercise, a sort of 
"aerobic bingo," according to Cassady. "I personally think bingo is good for 
your circulatory system," he said. "When you get close to winning, you get 
excited and your heart rate increases. It's a real adrenaline rush."

ANGELS FANS DON'T KNOW THE SCORE: GAME WAS POSTPONED 
</P>

<P>
How would you feel if you showed up at Anaheim Stadium on Saturday afternoon 
for the California Angels-Chicago White Sox game, only to find out it had been 
postponed to that night? 
</P>
<P>
"Traumatized," said Jeff Hoffman of Irvine, who had come with two friends. 
"We're three traumatized teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Hoffman is 21. But he says everybody is a teen-ager at a 
sunny-afternoon Angels game. And it wasn't too hard on them, since they were 
already dressed for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
But there were scores of Angels fans Saturday afternoon who somehow did not get 
the word that the game time had been changed from 1 p.m. to 7. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had announced the change July 20, after learning from NBC that it 
had dropped its plans to televise the game. Season ticket holders were informed 
by mail, and the change was eventually publicized by the news media. 
</P>
<P>
But some complained that the media should have emphasized it more. 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't Stu Nahan (Channel 5 sportscaster) say anything, man?" said Anthony 
Gomez, who had come from San Diego to join his brother and friends for the 
game. "TV should tell you these things." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Bozart and William Jackson had brought their two sons from Pasadena. 
Jackson's 11-year-old, Alonzo, had brought all his Angels baseball cards, and 
it was his first game. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't come back tonight," Bozart said. "This is just awful. No wonder we 
got such a great parking spot." 
</P>
<P>
One couple, too sheepish or to angry to allow their names to be used, had read 
in the newspaper the game was at 7. But they were sure the newspaper was wrong, 
because it said right there on the ticket, in black and white, 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Carter of Anaheim had taken his wife Sherry, her sister and the 
sister's son, to the game for Sherry's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a bummer," Sherry Carter said. "It's too late to change our other 
plans for tonight." 
</P>
<P>
For Pierre Howard and Ennis Howard, two brothers from Los Angeles, it was an 
easy decision to skip the game. Their tickets cost $9 each. They had Saturday 
night tickets for Hiroshima, a jazz group at the Greek Theatre, for $23 each. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll read the box scores," Pierre Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Some sold their tickets to others waiting in line for the night game tickets. 
Others simply gave them away. Some who did not have tickets got in line, while 
some said they would come another day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm big on the Angels; I'm not big on waiting in long lines," said Jeff 
Weinstein of La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
But most fans who had made the mistake said they would try to come back. 
</P>
<P>
Wes and Karen Matson had driven from Saugus -- an hour-and-a-half drive, they 
said -- with their 9-week-old daughter Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Matson wasn't blaming anyone but himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I just missed it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Matson said they would hang around at a mall until time for the night 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Some said they would go to the beach, and others said they would just go home 
and wait. But some may have privately shared the same idea voiced by Jesse 
Rodriguez of Los Angeles, who had come in the back of a pickup with the Anthony 
Gomez group. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go find Gene Autry and tell him what we think about this," Rodriguez 
suggested.

Members of the House and Senate are moving to correct a glitch in a formula 
that permits some wealthy communities, including Laguna Beach and Beverly 
Hills, to apply for low-income housing rehabilitation money while excluding 
many poorer areas such as Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and other lawmakers said 
Congress is likely to require the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development to revise the formula in September, when the Senate takes up the 
1990 HUD appropriations bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot of Questions' 
</P>
<P>
A quirk in the formula, which appears to give disproportionate help to areas 
with high rents, has piqued municipal officials throughout the nation, said one 
HUD official who asked not to be named. "There were a lot of questions," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
The formula determines which communities are eligible to apply for rent 
subsidies that support the rehabilitation of rental housing for the poor under 
HUD's troubled Section 8 program for moderate rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has yet to allocate about $220 million of the subsidy funds for 
moderate rehabilitation approved for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Maryland), the powerful chairwoman 
of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on HUD, said the panel "is taking a 
serious look at making modifications in the moderate rehab formula." 
</P>
<P>
Mikulski and the subcommittee want to "ensure that funding goes to those 
(communities) for which the program was originally created," said Garth Neuffer 
of Mikulski's office. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, Dornan has written to the chairman of the House Appropriations 
subcommittee on HUD, asking the panel's "help in correcting a very serious 
inequity." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan noted that under the eligibility formula, Laguna Beach, which boasted an 
estimated per capita income of $28,109 last year, is the only city in Orange 
County permitted to apply. In Santa Ana, which was excluded from the program, 
1988 per capita income was only $11,558. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is important to Mikulski, several sources said, because her home town 
of Baltimore is among the communities barred from applying for rent subsidies 
under the revised program. The per capita income in Baltimore is $10,509. 
</P>
<P>
Mikulski's subcommittee in September is scheduled to consider HUD's budget 
request of $12.9 billion for the 1990 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. A 
source close to the subcommittee said the panel is likely to order HUD to 
revise the moderate rehabilitation eligibility formula when it appropriates 
next year's HUD funding. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana city officials have written to Mikulski, requesting a change in the 
formula. 
</P>
<P>
The House, which has already considered the fiscal 1990 HUD funding bill, 
included no new money for the moderate rehabilitation program. But Dornan aide 
Brian O. Bennett said Dornan has asked the House subcommittee to intervene "in 
anticipation of having Barbara Mikulski fully fund (the program) in the Senate, 
and change the regulations." 
</P>
<P>
The question of funding the program in 1990 would then be resolved in a 
House-Senate conference committee. Regardless of the outcome, HUD would have to 
allocate the remainder of its 1989 money under a revised formula. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be something included in the HUD appropriations bill," said 
Patricia Jordan of The Ferguson Co., which represents Santa Ana in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp suspended the moderate-rehabilitation program on April 
26, after the agency's inspector general reported widespread favoritism and 
abuse in the awarding of rent subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, HUD grants 15-year rent-subsidy commitments to local housing 
agencies. The agencies select developers who wish to renovate apartment 
buildings and commit the subsidies to the developers. The subsidies pay much of 
the rent for low-income tenants. Developers use the long-term financial 
commitment of HUD rent subsidies to secure private financing to pay for their 
building repairs. 
</P>
<P>
When Kemp reinstated the moderate rehabilitation program on June 2, he included 
a new eligibility formula intended to create an environment in which objective 
criteria, rather than the personal judgment of local and regional HUD 
officials, would determine which communities are permitted to apply for 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
One HUD official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, explained that in 
order to establish objective criteria, HUD housing officials used a formula 
originally devised to allocate money to cities under a separate program that 
provides direct grants for the repair of rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
That program is administered by the assistant HUD secretary for community 
planning and development. The moderate rehabilitation program comes under the 
assistant secretary for housing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the same building, but we don't often use each other's data this 
way," said the official, who is involved with the moderate rehabilitation 
program. "It's not data that we in housing are familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
The new formula determines whether a community may apply for subsidy money by 
weighing several factors. 
</P>
<P>
A weight of 25% is given to the number of rental units in which the head of the 
household is at or below the poverty level. An additional 25% weight is 
assigned to the number of housing units built before 1940 in which the 
household head is at or below the poverty level. The remaining 50% weight is 
assigned to any of four factors: neighborhood overcrowding, incomplete kitchen 
facilities, poor plumbing or excessively high local market rents. 
</P>
<P>
The high-rent factor is probably what permitted Beverly Hills and Laguna Beach 
to qualify for subsidy applications, while less wealthy cities did not, 
officials have speculated. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that in the haste to get a reform package out of the department . . . 
they were perhaps a little too quick to move on it and accept these (new) 
criteria," a knowledgeable congressional aide said.

Have you been paying attention the past 100 years? As the Orange County

"The process is all so slow, as dreams are slow, as dreams suspend time like a 
balloon hung in midair. . . . But it seems that even for dreams, I have to work 
and wait. It hardly seems fair." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- W.P. Kinsella in his novel, "Shoeless Joe" 
</P>
<P>
 "I want (double-A) Midland to lose every game, I want (triple-A) Edmonton to 
lose every game and I want the Angels to lose every game. I want every guy 
that's ahead of me to get hurt and the ones that don't get hurt I want them to 
do lousy, because this is a career. If everybody does good, well, where is 
there going to be an opening for me? That's why we check what the Angels do 
every morning. We'll look in the paper and say, 'Damn it, they won again."' 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- An unidentified member of the Class-A Quad City Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Any time she wants, Rita Richwine can look out the second story window of her 
company lunchroom, gaze over the Mississippi River -- birthplace of some of the 
meanest bugs ever to attack a shortstop -- and see what's going on at John 
O'Donnell Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Her father introduced her to baseball, but asthma and a host of allergies -- 
including an aversion to corn tassels, akin to being allergic to air in these 
parts -- kept her from playing the game. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she loved baseball. One summer when she was a child, the television tube 
blew, rendering every game a blackout. But when games were scheduled for 
broadcast, she'd turn on the set, draw close as if preparing to hug it, and 
listen to games. 
</P>
<P>
And now she embraces this stadium where the dreams live and an unfathomable 
amount of river flies die. The Quad City Angels, one of the Angels' two Class-A 
teams, play here and Richwine comes to every home game, sitting in the first 
seat of the first row behind the home team dugout. 
</P>
<P>
When she isn't at a game -- keeping score accompanied by a radio tuned to Mario 
Impemba, "Voice of the Angels" -- she's making the players' meals, passing out 
pots, pans, towels and laundry detergent. 
</P>
<P>
Richwine, who lives in Moline, Ill., founded a support group, not a booster 
club, before this season. And Rita almost single-handedly supports the support 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 38 that said they would be active in the group," she said. "We have 
about 12 that actually are. And, to be honest, I would say I'm 90% of the 
group." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, besides the kamikaze bugs, the sub-freezing temperatures, the 
unbearable heat (it's not so much the heat but the 80%-100% humidity), besides 
living three and four to an apartment, with $11 a day on the road and Happy 
Hour leftovers at home -- "Another round of Buffalo Wings, awwwright!" -- the 
hardest thing for many of the kids playing ball in the Quad Cities to adjust to 
is the kind of niceness doled out by people such as Richwine. 
</P>
<P>
"People from Southern California, when someone is nice to you, you usually 
think there's a reason behind it," said Kyle Abbott, Quad City pitcher and the 
Angels' No. 1 pick in the 1989 draft. "You're real suspicious at first and then 
you realize these people are just being nice. That's quite a concept to get 
used to." 
</P>
<P>
Every year Richwine chooses her favorite players, every year she roots for them 
to do well and every year she cries when their talent takes them out of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
This is enough for her. She doesn't care about wins and losses. The Angels 
finished 26 1/2 games out of first place last season in the Midwest League's 
Southern Division. The year before, they were 46 games out. This season they 
won their first game, then dropped 10 in a row. At another point in the season, 
they lost eight in a row. 
</P>
<P>
But it's enough for Richwine to watch ballplayers "still willing to say hello 
and sign an autograph," in a 5,300-seat stadium cozy as a den that sits on the 
bank of the nation's greatest river, below a clumsy steel girder bridge that 
looks as if it was constructed from a very large erector set. 
</P>
<P>
Though located in the heart of America's breadbasket, though the movie "Field 
of Dreams" -- based on Kinsella's "Shoeless Joe" -- was shot less than an hour 
from it in a cornfield, there is nothing about this place that strikes of farm 
life. 
</P>
<P>
The Quad Cities -- two in Illinois, two in Iowa -- border each other, separated 
by the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport -- home to John O'Donnell Stadium -- is a city of more than 103,000, 
littered with countless soot-stained brick factories and warehouses that give 
the place that little bit of Pittsburgh feel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely not Green Acres," said Davenport resident Tom George. 
</P>
<P>
Moline is home to the huge John Deere plant and the more residential 
communities of Rock Island, Ill., and Bettendorf, Iowa, would never be mistaken 
for rural. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most people when they first come here are looking for hogs and all 
that farm stuff," said Eddie Rodriguez, Quad City manager. "I know I was." 
</P>
<P>
For most of the 1980s people weren't looking at all to come to the stadium. It 
had fallen into disrepair, transients slept on the benches and on the ground. 
There were no box seats just rusty folding chairs, bathrooms were too small. 
</P>
<P>
"Does the word hellhole ring a bell?" Impemba said. 
</P>
<P>
But a new owner, Rick Holtzman, and the infusion of $3 million during the past 
two years produced a face lift and a return of a respectable clientele. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting the families to come back," said Mike Tatoian, Quad City general 
manager. "For years this was a place where people just came to get drunk. 
Parents were afraid to bring their kids down here. But now we're getting old 
ladies out here again." 
</P>
<P>
Which, Tatoian explains, is good and bad. Old ladies buy tickets, but they 
rarely purchase nachos with jalapeno-cheese sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The team drew 115,000 last season, and is on pace to draw well over 150,000 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've turned the corner," Tatoian said, whose duties include cleaning 
backed-up sewers, washing windows and pulling the tarp on the field. 
</P>
<P>
The team could turn 360s for the next decade and it would never be enough for 
the players. It seems a bit sad that so many of them who are welcomed by 
Richwine are so eager to get out. 
</P>
<P>
But she seems to pay it little mind. Choosing her favorite player each year not 
because of RBIs or ERAs, but by virtue of a kindness done, a nice smile, a 
willingness to chat. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, her favorite player this season, infielder/outfielder J.R. Phillips, 
hates baseball, refuses to watch it, refuses to talk about it, believes it to 
be "the most boring sport in the world." 
</P>
<P>
J.R., a star athlete at La Puente's Bishop Amat High School, says he'd much 
rather watch tractor-truck pulls, which doesn't faze Richwine. 
</P>
<P>
"I like J.R. because he signs the most autographs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom George, who, in his five years of faithfully following the club has been 
known to voluntarily help passing hot dogs or take tickets at the stadium 
entrance, came upon his all-time favorite player by way of boredom. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dull game and a friend and I decided it would be fun to randomly 
choose a player and make him the hero for the rest of the year," he said. "We 
looked at the roster and one name stuck out at us." 
</P>
<P>
George and his friends made banners for the player, chanting his name whenever 
he batted. 
</P>
<P>
The name belonged to outfielder Dante Bichette, who went on to make it to the 
big team at the beginning of this season before being sent to the Angels' 
triple-A affiliate in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"Fan favorites at this level are born from nicknames, unusual names, a kid with 
a nice smile," Impemba said. "These people don't know these players. They don't 
know where they're going or where they've come from. They're just looking for 
someone to latch on to and root for." 
</P>
<P>
Richwine fell for her all-time favorite Angel, Gary Buckels, now at triple-A 
Edmonton, when he picked up part of her program that had blown on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"When Gary handed it back to me, a gentleman, and I use that term loosely, 
sitting next to me said 'Some women will do anything to meet a ballplayer.' 
</P>
<P>
"I blushed, Gary blushed, and that was it, he was my favorite," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She sends Buckels birthday cards and recalls his promotion from Quad City to 
double-A Midland like a death in the family. 
</P>
<P>
"He came over to me and said, 'There's something I have to tell you.' I said, 
'What is it?' He said, 'I'm not going to be here after tonight.' " 
</P>
<P>
Her voice weakens. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Why, where are you going?' He said Midland. I cried for three days. I 
think I'm going to cry right now." 
</P>
<P>
 "'This must be heaven,' he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "'No, it's Iowa,' I reply." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kinsella, "Shoeless Joe." 
</P>
<P>
 "Like everyone else, I'd like to get out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- J.R. Phillips, Angel player. 
</P>
<P>
Does heaven have flies? 
</P>
<P>
It's not that there are a lot of flies at John O'Donnell Stadium, it's that 
every fly on the continent seems to be at the stadium, as if it were some 
mandatory midway point, an Ellis Island for flying insects. 
</P>
<P>
Games have been called at the stadium because of the flies. Players are 
regularly attacked, getting flies in their eyes and hair. They are regularly 
swallowed -- the bugs, not the players -- by accident. Crowds have been known 
to retreat one row at a time as the flies made their way up the stands. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the price is paid for a riverfront view. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell other teams it's the Davenport snow," said Rodriguez. "Snow in 
June." 
</P>
<P>
The first time Impemba broadcast a game from the stadium, he actually thought 
the flies were a slow moving rainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
The flies, called Shag flies, May flies, River flies, or any one of innumerable 
expletives, are the type that live just 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"They hatch in the river, fly up, buzz around for 24 hours, die and liter the 
ground," Impemba said. "As far as I can tell, that's their only purpose on this 
earth." 
</P>
<P>
Players strike back anyway they can, some putting two-way tape outside the 
dugout to snare the flies, then using them as fishing lures. 
</P>
<P>
With the warm summer months bringing out the spiders and their webs, pitcher 
Mike Erbe has taken to catching the flies, placing them on the spider webs and 
"watching the spiders suck the blood from the flies. It's sort of like 
catering." 
</P>
<P>
The flies don't come until the heat of the summer months. Which means the 
players are free from pests but not from hypothermia during the chill of April 
and May. 
</P>
<P>
When the team opened this season at Cedar Rapids, the thermometer tipped to 19 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I had on a pair of long johns, two pairs of shorts, two pairs of socks, a 
T-shirt, a long-sleeve shirt, a jacket, another jacket and I was still 
freezing," said pitcher Mark Zapella. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a hit in the first inning and I couldn't feel my hands for the rest of 
the game," Phillips said. "That was scary." 
</P>
<P>
Then the thaw comes, microwave-style. Temperatures in 90s with humidity to 
match. Buckels once said there's no problem getting warmed up in Quad City, 
"You just stand there and melt." 
</P>
<P>
Not only does it play havoc with sweat glands, but transportation. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the players chipped in on a 1980 Chevy Citation, dubbed the Car of 
Personality because the overhead runner was ripped out of the car and the 
ceiling was used to engrave "peoples' favorite bands, favorite saying, it was 
very vulgar," Erbe said. 
</P>
<P>
The local color wasn't restricted to the interior. 
</P>
<P>
"The car got egged," Erbe said. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't get egged," said Abbott, who played at Mission Viejo High. "It got 
hit by a poultry farm." 
</P>
<P>
One night, perhaps after one too many buffalo wings, several of the guys 
decided to break dance on the car and ended breaking some windows. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of that hot July afternoon, the car was well-stocked with 
character. Unfortunately, it was void of oil. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it would just run on gas and water," Erbe said. "Boy, I've never 
seen so much smoke." 
</P>
<P>
The car was abandoned, foiling a planned Viking funeral for the Car of 
Personality at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to drive it into the Mississippi and just watch it float away," 
Erbe said. 
</P>
<P>
In attempt to keep his players -- many of whom are away from home or at least 
some type of supervision for the first time -- out of trouble, Rodriguez 
employs a rather loose network of spies, bartenders, informants and guys who 
spend a lot of time on barstools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how quickly they find out where the happening places are," 
Rodriguez said. "It's like they don't have to be told. It's like radar." 
</P>
<P>
And readings so far this season have come to one conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"Moline rages," yell five players and various friends at a Davenport restaurant 
called "The Ground Round." 
</P>
<P>
If Moline does rage, you ask, what are they doing in Davenport? 
</P>
<P>
"Free food," Phillips says. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo wings, awwwright! 
</P>
<P>
 When things get a bit too festive, Rodriguez, who spent seven years as a 
player in the Baltimore and Angel farm systems, may dole out some forceful 
advice or a $5 fine. At the Class-A level, $5 can mean financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
"You should see, they get awful cranky when you tell them they're out five 
bucks," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Which has made Abbott, no relation, by the way, to Angel pitcher Jim Abbott, 
particularly popular in these parts. He worried at first that the fact that he 
signed for a $200,000 bonus might rub some players the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't have been more mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
"When we heard he was coming, everybody wanted him to be their roommate so they 
wouldn't have to spend anymore money," Erbe said. "I got him." 
</P>
<P>
And he laughs one of those mad scientist laughs. Maybe it's just for show or 
maybe it's knowing he and Abbott are going car shopping, and guess who's 
paying?

ARMAS COMES THROUGH ONCE AGAIN FOR ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Armas settled into a new position in the Angels' lineup Saturday night and 
found it suited him well. 
</P>
<P>
With designated hitter Brian Downing taking the night off, Manager Doug Rader 
inserted Armas in Downing's spot. And it turned out to be just the tonic Armas 
needed to end a couple of lengthy streaks. 
</P>
<P>
One swing ended an zero-for-15 slump and a three-week streak without a home 
run. Armas hit a fastball from White Sox pitcher Steve Rosenberg for a solo 
home run in the fifth inning of the Angels' 2-1 victory over Chicago at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was his first home run since he hit a game-winning three-run homer July 4 
against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Armas struck out and sent Daryl Boston to the left-field foul pole to catch a 
drive in his other at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
So does Armas like being a DH? 
</P>
<P>
"Right now my role is to be ready when they need me," he said. "When he (Rader) 
wants to give a guy some rest, I'm going to be ready. I know I can still play 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
Armas has spent time on the disabled list and been the fourth man in a solid 
outfield. Nevertheless, his contributions have been many. 
</P>
<P>
His home run was his seventh this season and raised his average to .283. 
</P>
<P>
On a team without one standout batter, Armas' hitting only adds depth to an 
already deep team. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Angels have four players in double figures in home runs. And 
three others, Downing and Devon White, who have nine apiece, and Armas aren't 
far behind. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like every time he gets a chance he does something to help the club," 
Rader said. "It would be interesting to see how well we've played with him in 
the lineup. But even more interesting to see how we've done without him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very valuable member of the ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Rader figures the Angels are better off with Armas playing. But finding him a 
spot in the starting lineup is difficult. Outfielders White, Chili Davis and 
Claudell Washington have played most games. Armas did get a chance to play 
regularly when Washington missed 14 games with an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from that stint in right field, Armas, who played in just his 28th game 
Saturday, has had to make his mark when he could. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to play any time (Rader) wants me to," he said. "Like tonight, he 
wanted to give Downing a little rest. I'm pretty happy over here and they use 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Armas hasn't been especially pleased with the way he was hitting recently, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
He had gone hitless since July 15, a span of four games. His average had 
slumped from .325 down to .281 entering Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
This after getting off to an impressive start this season. At one point early 
in the year, Armas had hit in 12 consecutive games. However, with Armas playing 
infrequently, it covered a span of 86 days. 
</P>
<P>
"I was making good contact, but I had no luck," Armas said of his recent lack 
of hitting. "But I kept working."

COSTA MESA'S MAKI BEATEN BY FLORIDIAN IN U.S. JUNIOR GOLF FINAL

David Duval hit a shot so bad Saturday that it turned out good and helped him 
beat Austin Maki of Costa Mesa in the final of the U.S. Junior Amateur 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
After his tee shot on the 15th hole at Singing Hills landed on the fourth 
green, Duval looked as if he would lose his one-hole lead over Maki. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Duval ended up winning the hole, then held off a typical late charge 
by Maki to win the tournament, 1-up. 
</P>
<P>
"He missed that drive so bad he should have been (out of bounds)," said Maki, 
who had become the first player to qualify last in medal play and then reach 
the final. "Instead he had a good shot (to the green)." 
</P>
<P>
Duval, of Ponte Vedra, Fla., had birdied the par-four 14th hole to take his 
first lead in the final. But his drive from the elevated tee of the par-four 
15th looked as if it was headed for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Instead it went over a lake and landed 20 feet from the pin on No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit it hard enough and off line enough to get a break like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duval got a free drop that gave him a better angle to the 15th green. 
</P>
<P>
After Maki's second shot sailed over the green, Duval hit his shot over a 
40-foot tree and dropped it eight feet from the pin. 
</P>
<P>
When Maki missed a three-foot putt for bogey, Duval was up by two. 
</P>
<P>
Maki had made a habit of rallying in this tournament, and he did it again, 
making a five-footer on No. 17 to cut Duval's lead to a single hole. But his 
comeback try came up inches short when a 60-foot birdie putt on 18 stopped just 
in front of the cup. 
</P>
<P>
Maki finished a miraculous week in which he finished tied for 57th with nine 
other golfers during qualifying. RICK HAZELTINE
