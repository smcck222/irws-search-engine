BOBBY DAY; HAD NO. 2 HIT WITH 'ROBIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singer Bobby Day, whose songs "Little Bitty Pretty One" and "Rockin' Robin" 
soared to the top of rock 'n' roll charts in the 1950s, has died of cancer in 
Los Angeles, a family friend said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Day, 60, was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital July 15 and died Friday, said 
Karen Castillo, owner of Desert Rose Productions and Solid Gold Entertainment 
Management in Daggett. 
</P>
<P>
He had been treated for an ulcer for the last year, Castillo said. Doctors 
discovered an intestinal tumor when he was last hospitalized, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Texas, Day was born Robert James Byrd. In 1958, he wrote and 
recorded "Little Bitty Pretty One" -- his affectionate name for his wife, 
Jackie. An up-tempo version recorded by Thurston Harris with Day's blessings 
was a bigger hit the same year. 
</P>
<P>
Day was the first to record the Jimmie Thomas song "Rockin' Robin," and his 
version hit No. 2 on the Billboard charts in 1958. The song became a hit again 
many years later for the Jackson 5. 
</P>
<P>
Day also wrote and recorded "Over and Over" in 1958, and his other recordings 
include "The Bluebird," "The Buzzard &amp; the Oriole," "Gotta New Girl" and 
"That's All I Want" in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the biggest heart of any man I've ever known," Castillo said. "He loved 
people. His thing was making people happy. That's why he was on stage." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Day formed the Hollywood Flames, a group that had hit singles 
with "Buzz-Buzz-Buzz" and "Crazy." He also recorded "Gee Whiz" as part of the 
duo Bob &amp; Earl. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't one of these kids that popped up and got lucky," Castillo said. "He 
was extremely talented. His rhythm and blues voice was dynamic and 
captivating." 
</P>
<P>
Day recently appeared in the nationwide tour "30 Years of Rock 'n' Roll" with 
Donnie Brooks and Tiny Tim. 
</P>
<P>
"You never saw him without a smile," Castillo said. "The No. 1 thing for him 
was entertaining people." 
</P>
<P>
Along with his wife, he is survived by children Robert, Robbie, Simone and 
Aaron and eight grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Services will be Saturday at Angelus Funeral Home, 3875 Crenshaw Blvd., with 
burial at Holy Cross Cemetery.

WHERE ARE THE SPOILS OF PEACE?; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: PEOPLE ARE TAKING TO THE STREETS TO DEMAND ECONOMIC RELIEF, NOT TO 
BRING BACK THE SANDINISTAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN DISKIN, Martin Diskin, professor of anthropology at MIT, was an 
observer at Nicaragua's February election. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During this month's strikes in Nicaragua, the paving-stone barricades, the 
handkerchief masks and the gunshots all looked like a reprise of the 1979 
Sandinista insurrection that overthrew the Somoza dictatorship. But this was 
not a Sandinista attempt against the coalition government elected earlier this 
year. It was merely a logical expression of frustration that the government, 
chosen in an election that was conducted under the shadow of U.S. power, has 
not addressed major national problems. 
</P>
<P>
The American people, their Congress and the Nicaraguan people were all affected 
by the Reagan Administration policy, a puerile anti-communism whose roots 
reached deep into an illegal, subterranean world. Then the Bush Administration 
converted the 10 years of military and economic punishment into a bribe: The 
United States would ease up on the war and end the economic embargo if 
Washington's preferred candidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, won the 
election. The Sandinistas had agreed to call the election earlier than required 
by Nicaragua's constitution, believing that the Contras would be demobilized 
before the voting, as the Central American presidents' agreement had 
stipulated. But, with the Administration's support, the Contras did not 
demobilize, which made it difficult for the Sandinistas to campaign on ending 
the draft. 
</P>
<P>
When the voters rejected the Sandinistas, they were seeking -- and expecting -- 
relief from the economic hardships they suffered as well as an end to the 
U.S.-sponsored Contra war. President Chamorro's devotion to reconciliation, 
with United Nations help, has brought the war to a close. But, instead of the 
jobs and economic reactivation she promised, the population has seen austerity, 
"structural adjustment," "privatization," currency devaluation and other 
measures that leave the poor worse off while new government bureaucrats collect 
fat salaries, reportedly paid in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The recent disturbances challenged neo-liberal policies that will indefinitely 
postpone long awaited relief. Although Sandinista-organized, the strikes tapped 
such profound discontent that the Sandinista leadership began urging an end to 
the barricades and seizures of buildings. The military and police, still 
largely Sandinista, performed professionally during the strikes and obeyed 
presidential orders, Politically, the Sandinistas' complaint is not with the 
election's outcome, but with their historic contribution's being erased by the 
schemers behind Violeta's throne, like Vice President Virgilio Godoy's 
supporters who called for U.S. intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Given the Bush Administration's emphasis on democracy, the Nicaraguan election 
outcome should be hailed as a great success. A peaceful transition, a 
depoliticized civilian-controlled army, (in strong contrast to El Salvador's), 
multiparty pluralism, vigorous civic-interest groups -- these have all been 
applauded in Eastern Europe. But, having achieved "democracy" in Nicaragua 
after the election, the U.S. agenda is far from complete; it hasn't achieved 
public acceptance of a private-sector-driven, "trickle down" development model. 
Achieving this seems less likely than ever in light of the widespread strikes 
and other protests. Washington's options have dangerously narrowed. Will 
another U.S. invasion be necessary to seal the Nicaraguan election of 1990? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the strongest voice against intervention was that of Chamorro. While it 
may get her in trouble with Washington, she has made it clear that she will 
deal with the Sandinistas realistically and seek to reach a negotiated modus 
vivendi with them. The reaction of the Godoy faction during the strikes also 
suggests that it's not in the Sandinistas' interests to destabilize the 
Chamorro government and give an opening to the interventionists. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the recent events, chaotic as they may seem to us, are an effort to 
create rules of the game that reflect the post-election realities. 
</P>
<P>
If this process is allowed to continue, a far more solid and meaningful 
national consensus may emerge. It could serve as a bellwether for other Central 
American countries, particularly El Salvador, where, despite several elections, 
national tensions may be resolved only through the present round of 
U.N.-mediated negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations -- in the street or around the bargaining table -- are crucial for 
the groups battered by years of war and repression. Failure to support this 
process will lead to more war and intervention. Many wonder if Washington is 
finally able to appreciate this.

INNER-CITY VIOLENCE AND GUN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your recently published commentary by Gerald Petievich ("We've Got to Start 
Somewhere; Giving Up Is No Answer," July 18) argues that gun control is a 
necessary precondition to controlling gang violence in Los Angeles. What the 
argument does not consider is that the cure is worse than the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, let's remove or severely limit the rights of the 12 million people in the 
greater Los Angeles area in order to have a law enforcement tool to use against 
the 75,000 gang members. This is an example of the foolish willingness of 
simple-solution minded people to trade our individual rights (which we will 
definitely lose) for the promise of reducing crime. Trade my rights under the 
Second Amendment so the police can have a tool? Come on, there are 20,000 gun 
laws in America today; they are distinguished by their lack of use against 
hard-core criminals or gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of suggesting that the law-abiding gun owners have their rights limited 
and be required to show evidence of firearms training and have to carry 
liability insurance, why don't we limit the ability of newspapers and TV news 
shows to show acts of violence, and require certain education and experience 
levels before becoming journalists? After all, that might reduce crime, too.

U.S. POLICY ON CAMBODIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Administration's recent about-face on Cambodia can only be applauded, no 
matter how late the reversal comes, and no matter the degree of previous 
support for a despicable policy. That this, and previous, Administrations have 
helped to fund a group of rebel forces that includes the Khmer Rouge must rank 
as one of the venal acts in U.S foreign-policy history.

BRITAIN NEEDS ANSWERS FOR 3.25 MILLION SUBJECTS IN HONG KONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If I don't get out of Hong Kong by 1997, I'm finished, I know it." The quiet 
desperation in Li Qiang's words reflects the growing anxiety of millions of 
Hong Kong residents. 
</P>
<P>
They, like the 42-year-old laborer, are consumed with fear and uncertainty 
about what will happen when the British return Hong Kong to China seven years 
from now. 
</P>
<P>
Li Qiang and about 45,000 others flocked to the Hong Kong Immigration 
Department last week on the final day to apply for a special program that will 
give full British citizenship to 50,000 families, about 225,000 persons, who 
will be allowed to emigrate to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The British Nationality Act is woefully inadequate and unfair. Only 4% of Hong 
Kong's 5.8 million residents are eligible to emigrate, although 3.25 million 
already hold restricted British nationality documents. 
</P>
<P>
That's not very generous for a nation that has enjoyed the fruits of Hong Kong 
since 1898. Britain is simply not fulfilling its moral obligation to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
The British maintain that the emigration program was designed to favor those 
skilled, educated and entrepreneurial individuals who are critical to Hong 
Kong's continued prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
They need the assurance of full British citizenship so they can continue to 
work in Hong Kong while keeping the option to leave in 1997, when Britain's 
99-year lease ends. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, China promised to maintain Hong Kong's freewheeling economic and 
social system under a program called "one country, two systems." But the people 
of Hong Kong lost confidence after pro-democracy demonstrations in China were 
crushed in June, 1989. Since then, more than 1,000 residents a week have left. 
</P>
<P>
Britain alone can't absorb the 3.25 million Hong Kong residents who already 
have papers. But it has used the entrepreneurial flair and capital of Hong 
Kong. In return it should expand the emigration program.

I served in Vietnam on the Cambodian border from mid-1968 through mid-1970. 
Before, during and after that period the North Vietnamese Army staged massive 
attacks from inside Cambodia against U.S. and Vietnamese troops and civilian 
population centers. The NVA forces received the bulk of their war materiel 
through the port of Sihanoukville with the full approval and cooperation of 
Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Thousands of American casualties resulted from 
Sihanouk's assistance to the NVA. The May, 1970, incursion into Cambodia by 
U.S. and Vietnamese forces saved countless allied lives.

A GOOD SAMARITAN;

<P>
THE GOOD DIE YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Smith helped a fellow citizen. Sadly, it cost him his life. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old San Diego carpet layer was cut down, brutally and needlessly, 
because he cared enough to get involved, something so few of us do. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was installing a rug in a condominium when he heard screams from a woman 
in the building next door. He went to her rescue and chased a gun-wielding 
burglar. Smith, who was not armed, was shot in the face, abdomen, left arm and 
right thigh. He succumbed last week to the ravages of the four bullet wounds 
after enduring five operations. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith inspired other citizens of San Diego. They came to his aid in his 
battle against death. More than 500 people each donated a pint of blood in 
Smith's name. Donations, which continue to flow in, now total about $27,000. 
The San Diego Police Officers Assn. established a $1,000 scholarship fund for 
Smith's three children. More than a thousand letters and cards poured into 
Scripps Memorial Hospital where his family held vigil for six days. 
</P>
<P>
In his memory, the hospital lowered its flag to half staff -- the first time it 
has done so for a patient. His family articulated the loss that the entire 
community feels: "We are devastated. His death is not fair because he was so 
good, and he was only trying to help." 
</P>
<P>
We, too, mourn the death of Gary Smith, who courageously followed his 
conscience as a good Samaritan. If only the gunman had had a conscience.

THE WAGES OF DEREGULATION; 
</P>
<P>
DOES PUBLIC SAFETY FLY WITH EASTERN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Justice Department has obtained criminal indictments against Eastern 
Airlines and nine of its managers on charges they failed to maintain passenger 
aircraft properly, then lied to conceal their negligence. The department's 
announcement is a welcome sign of federal authorities' willingness to attack a 
problem to which The Times first drew attention more than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1986, Times writers Richard E. Meyer and Ralph Vartabedian reported 
that deregulation of the airline industry and a diminution in federal oversight 
forced by budgetary restraints had combined to seriously erode the commercial 
air fleet's margin of safety. Their story documented not only the increasing 
average age and use of passenger aircraft, but also the decline in maintenance 
spending as an overall percentage of the airlines' operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
As James M. Dimin, an aircraft engineering and maintenance expert hired as a 
consultant by The Times, put it: "Deregulation has been a disaster both in 
terms of its effect on maintenance practices and, ultimately, in its effect on 
safety." 
</P>
<P>
If the allegations contained in the government's 60-count indictment of Eastern 
and its supervisors are proven at trial, the troubled airline's situation will 
stand as a striking example of the threat to public safety created by the 
federal government's sloth in arresting the trends set in motion by 
deregulation. "Thousands of innocent passengers may have been put at risk every 
day by the actions of these defendants," Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said in 
announcing the indictments. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, one of the airline industry's most troubled carriers, has been the 
target of a strike by unionized mechanics for more than a year. As a 
consequence, the company has filed for protection from its creditors under 
Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
The government charges that between July, 1985, and October, 1989, officials at 
Eastern's Miami headquarters, who were themselves under intense financial and 
competitive pressure, intimidated supervisors at maintenance centers in New 
York and Atlanta "to keep the aircraft in flight at all costs." To that end, 
the government alleges the supervisors failed to inspect fuel tanks, knowingly 
installed faulty cockpit gauges and improperly maintained landing gears, fuel 
systems, automatic pilots and radar. To conceal this conduct, the government 
says, they altered work cards and log books and forged other employees' names 
to maintenance records. 
</P>
<P>
Vigorous prosecution of such alleged conduct will, as the assistant U.S. 
attorney handling the case said, "Send a clear signal not just to Eastern, but 
to the entire airline industry." It also ought to send a message to Congress 
and the Bush Administration that the government's approach to airline 
regulation also is in need of preventive maintenance.

GRAYSON NAMED WESTLAKE COACH

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Grayson, an assistant basketball coach for four years at Canyon High, has 
been selected as the boys' varsity coach at Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
Grayson succeeds Greg Hess, who accepted an assistant coaching position at Cal 
Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Grayson, 31, also coached the junior varsity team at Canyon High. 
</P>
<P>
"Westlake is a good program and I was very much interested in moving up," 
Grayson said of Westlake (13-10, 7-5 in league play), which finished in a 
three-way tie for third in the Marmonte League last season. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to his arrival at Canyon, Grayson coached the freshman team for three 
seasons at St. Bernard High in Playa Del Rey and was the junior varsity coach 
for two years at Van Nuys High.

Woodland Hills West confirmed Sunday that it can win American Legion baseball 
tournaments two ways -- through the winners' bracket and through the losers' 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
A week after claiming the District 20 championship with four consecutive 
victories, West beat Claremont in a doubleheader, 5-2 and 16-7, to cap a 
five-game march through the losers' bracket of the 6th Area playoffs at UCLA's 
Jackie Robinson Stadium and capture its second title in a row. 
</P>
<P>
West, which was forced to play five games in three days after a first-round 
loss to Claremont, advances to the state playoffs Aug. 4-7 in Yountville, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great win. Two doubleheaders in a row," said West Coach Don 
Hornback, whose team won twice on Saturday as well. "I think the impressive 
thing is that we won with five different pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Geller, normally West's starting second baseman, and Pat Treend, a 
tenacious right-hander, notched complete-game wins Sunday. Geller (5-0) 
scattered eight hits -- seven of them singles -- in the first game and did not 
allow an earned run. 
</P>
<P>
"We played great defense today; some of those guys hit some shots," said 
Geller, who started for the first time in a month. "I was relying on my defense 
because that's the kind if pitcher I am. I don't really strike people out." 
</P>
<P>
Geller was being modest. He struck out seven and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
In the nightcap, Treend (5-3) allowed 16 hits -- 13 of them singles -- in 
avenging his loss in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
That loss snapped West's 20-game winning strike and left the defending World 
Series champions one loss away from elimination. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Bromberg and Terry Morrow each recorded victories Saturday while Sean 
Boldt picked up a win Friday. Only Morrow failed to record a complete game, 
pitching 8 1/3 innings before yielding to Geller. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont Coach Jack Helber, on the other hand, couldn't find an ace in his 
pitching staff and did more shuffling than a Las Vegas blackjack dealer. 
</P>
<P>
The District 18 champion used three pitchers in allowing West just six hits in 
the first game. But in the nightcap Helber utilized seven hurlers -- three of 
them in the fourth inning when West sent 12 batters to the plate before an out 
was recorded. 
</P>
<P>
West's nine-run onslaught gave it a 10-5 advantage, wiping out a 5-1 Claremont 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had the momentum," Helber said. "But we could not find an out and 
we could not find the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Claremont pitchers frequently found the dirt in front of home plate, the air 
above batters' heads and both batters' boxes, but seldom the catcher's glove. 
West received 14 walks -- four each in the fourth and sixth innings. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, starter Jaime Rodriguez (5-3) issued eight walks in 4 1/3 
innings and was charged with all five West runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We walked too many guys. You can't win games that way," Helber said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being down, 11-5, after 5 1/2 innings in the second game, Helber said 
he felt his team was still in contention. West's Bobby Kim quickly gave Helber 
a new outlook. 
</P>
<P>
With two out, reliever Bob Skapik, Claremont's fourth pitcher, walked Del 
Marine and Jason Cohen, then fed Kim a low 1-2 breaking ball. Kim drove the 
ball about 430 feet, well beyond the left-center-field fence, for a 14-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We were getting down but at the same time it was only the (sixth) inning," 
Helber said. "But Kim's blast put it out of sight. That was the killer."

On the Lam: More than 200 supporters, many wearing "Run Bambi Run" T-shirts, 
rallied Friday in Milwaukee to wish a convicted killer luck in evading capture. 
Lawrencia Bembenek, 31, a former model and policewoman convicted of murdering 
her then-husband's ex-wife in 1981, is believed to have fled with her fiance 
after scaling a fence July 15 at a Wisconsin women's prison. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters maintained that Bembenek received an unfair trial and was the victim 
of a police setup. 
</P>
<P>
Book Judgment: London judge Michael Wright on Friday temporarily banned author 
Malcolm Barker from publishing "Courting Disaster" anywhere in the world 
because it reportedly gives intimate details about Britain's royal family. The 
judge ordered a delay in enforcing the ban until today pending an appeal. The 
book is already on sale in Canada, the United States and Bermuda. Barker was a 
clerk in Buckingham Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Adjudged: A former Playboy model was sentenced late last week in Milwaukee to 
10 months in prison for evading taxes on $686,000 that an aging millionaire 
paid her during a five-year sexual relationship with both the model and her 
sister. Lynnette Harris, 35, was convicted in May by a federal jury that did 
not accept her claims that the money represented tax-free gifts. Harris 
received money from David Kritzik of suburban Shorewood, who died last summer 
at age 89. "I got involved in this relationship and it has turned out to be a 
nightmare," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Break-In?: A co-defendant in the drug-trafficking case of former 
Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega was arrested at an exclusive home in Miami 
once owned by President Richard Nixon. Roberto Steiner was arrested Thursday at 
the mansion, law officials said Friday.

JACK SMITH: WOE TO THE FISHBOWL LIFESTYLE OF THE COLUMNIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In writing a column five days a week, year after year, one inevitably reveals 
more of himself than he may want to. 
</P>
<P>
As impersonal as I try to be, some aspects of my character, my private self, 
are likely to appear, as in a mirror darkly. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, I would have assumed that I had shown myself as a gentle, thoughtful, 
helpful and loving husband, father and grandfather, and a good fellow in any 
society. 
</P>
<P>
But I have not tried to conceal the fact that I dislike gardening, that I am 
addicted to sex and violence on television, that I attend Philharmonic 
concerts, the opera and the theater, and that I am an indifferent traveler. 
</P>
<P>
Not a great deal there to like, I admit; on the other hand, I do not think of 
myself as a wholly unlikeable person, and especially not as a cold one. 
</P>
<P>
As I say, however, if one writes about anything at all, one cannot help 
exposing his innermost nature, if only indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
So perhaps reader Frank Biro of Van Nuys is correct when he complains that "I 
wonder if at home you are cold and formal with your family and pets?" 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Biro notes that I apparently expect my wife to do the housework, and 
consider that I have done more than my share if I place a TV dinner in the 
micro. 
</P>
<P>
I'm afraid Mr. Biro has struck close to the truth on that point. It is true 
that my wife does most of the housework, what little is left by our 
one-day-a-week housecleaner. She often consults me on what TV dinner to put in 
the micro, but the actual act of placing the dinner in the micro is usually 
left to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I was under the impression," Mr. Biro goes on, "that marriage was 
cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it is. Having been married 51 years, I suggest to Mr. Biro that that 
fact alone implies that there has been a great deal of cooperation. I may not 
cook, but my contributions to our mutual well-being have been too numerous to 
list. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there are your sons' wives. They call you 'Mr. Smith.' Do your 
grandchildren also stay forbidden to call you 'Grandpa'?" 
</P>
<P>
Only my French daughter-in-law calls me Mr. Smith. My Italian daughter-in-law 
calls me Jack. My five grandchildren call me "Grandpa," or "Grampa." In my 
French daughter-in-law's family, a father-in-law was called monsieur. She does 
not care to defer to American tradition in that respect. I am not foolish 
enough to forbid any of them anything. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that my wife and I do not use terms of endearment. I call her Denny, 
she calls me Jack. We have never used honey or dear or love or any other such 
words. If that implies that we are cold, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Biro's criticism of my treatment of animals is somehow more galling. "If 
you feed them they are fortunate," he says. "If they disappear . . . joy . . . 
no more requirements for you. . . . For the sake of all who share your private 
life, have a little humanity." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Biro evidently refers to my report on the disappearance of our mixed 
Yorkie, Fluff. Fluff was at least 15 years old, deaf, blind and disoriented. 
Evidently she had even lost her sense of smell. She simply vanished. We never 
found any trace of her. Fluff's joy in life had long since ended, and I was not 
overcome with grief at her probable demise. 
</P>
<P>
I asked my wife if she thought I was cold. She laughed mischievously. The 
difference between us, I think, is that my glass is half empty, hers is half 
full. 
</P>
<P>
I asked my French daughter-in-law if she thought I was cold. She said she knew 
I was not cold, but sometimes I seemed to be off in another world. 
</P>
<P>
That's it exactly. I may sometimes seem aloof, or distracted, not because I am 
cold, but because I am always thinking about the higher things. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I tend to speculate on our origins, on the consolations of religion, 
on the deterioration of our planet, on the greed that corrupts our society, on 
the meaning of infinity, on the state of my cardiovascular system, on the curse 
of racism, on the uncertainty of life, for dogs and human beings alike. 
</P>
<P>
When caught up in these musings I may seem cold, especially if I am in the 
midst of gaiety; but I assure Mr. Biro and anyone else who cares, that I am 
none the less high-spirited, good-natured, generous, warm and vulnerable, and 
all anyone has to do is offer me a glass of wine to bring me around. Sometimes 
I'm the life of the party. 
</P>
<P>
I do think it might be more dignified, however, if the kids called me 
grandfather.

'Little Mermaid' a Little Racy?: Who says you can tell a kid's movie by its 
cover? A Phoenix supermarket chain pulled copies of Disney's animated movie 
"The Little Mermaid" off its shelves last week when a customer complained that 
artwork on the cover contains an offensive phallic symbol. Michelle Couch of 
Mesa said that her husband pointed out the offending artwork to her. 
</P>
<P>
She said she complained to the chain, Bashas', only after being ignored by 
Disney. Tanya Steele, vice president of publicity for Buena Vista Home Video, a 
Disney subsidiary, said that about a dozen people have complained about a 
phallic symbol they believe is part of a golden castle drawn on the cover of 
the video tape. But she added it is not likely that the drawing will be 
changed. GREG BRAXTON

Say It Ain't So, Joe!: There doesn't seem to be a new dawn for NBC's troubled 
"Today" show and its three hosts -- Bryant Gumbel, Deborah Norville and Joe 
Garagiola. Despite a revamped format and the return of Garagiola as co-host, 
"Today" last week suffered its lowest ratings in nearly seven years, according 
to Nielsen audience estimates. 
</P>
<P>
While ABC's "Good Morning America" won its 29th consecutive ratings victory 
with a 4.2 average, "Today" was well behind with a 2.9, its lowest average 
since the week of Aug. 6, 1983, when it had a 2.8 average. "CBS This Morning" 
remained a distant third with a 2.2 average. (Each ratings point represents 
921,000 homes.) "Today" is attempting to recover from a ratings slide that 
began in January after 13-year veteran Jane Pauley left the show. She was its 
co-host when it hit its previous ratings low in 1983. GREG BRAXTON

THREE KINDS OF METAL, PRECIOUS LITTLE LUSTER;

POP MUSIC: CROSSOVER SHENANIGANS ARE PLAYED AT THE SANTA MONICA CIVIC.

If a band gets played on metal stations, flashes its chests in metal fanzines, 
has its T-shirts worn by Metallica and its videos played on "Headbangers' 
Ball," you might logically assume that the band in question plays metal. 
</P>
<P>
But a whole lot of punk and alternative bands have decided that shaggy locks 
and guitar solos aren't so bad after all -- ask Top-20 "metal" band Faith No 
More. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, metal's just a marketing niche, man. 
</P>
<P>
And the sold-out Danzig-Soundgarden-Corrosion of Conformity concert at the 
Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on Saturday night was a state-of-the-art survey 
of crossover shenanigans, three ways to approach sort-of-metal. Slam dancers, 
clean-cut college kids and extremely tattooed thrashers showed up in droves. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina's Corrosion of Conformity, the spectacularly intense, hard-core 
trio that broke up a while ago, recently sprouted splendid manes of hair, 
recruited a few new members and became reborn as a speed-metal quintet looking 
for a major-label deal. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, singer Karl Agell aped the asthmatic three-note moaning of early 
Metallica, occasionally stopping between songs to recite a bit of apocalyptic 
poetry, while his guitar players alternated standard speed-metal wham-wham-wham 
with minor-key half-speed goth straight out of the Ozzy songbook. Agell's 
famous hypnotic stare barely made it past the stage apron. These days, CoC 
seems less corrosive than conforming. 
</P>
<P>
Hot off a Grammy nomination and the headlining spot on a tour with Voivod, 
Soundgarden is still less a metal band than an art band with hard-rock 
influences, still more influential on college radio than on commercial 
hard-rock stations. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Cornell is one of the few guys in alternative metal who can actually sing 
-- the standard comparison is to Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant, though Cornell's 
piercing wail has a plangency Plant's never approached -- and Kim Thayil's 
noisy, droning guitar sounds something like a postgraduate Fred (Sonic) Smith 
-- dissonance that rocks. 
</P>
<P>
But this was one of Soundgarden's first gigs in a venue much larger than a 
club, also one of the first with a new bassist, the third within a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Civic's boomy acoustics swallowed the complex arrangements, and its huge 
stage swallowed its onstage chemistry -- the tempos seemed close to collapsing 
at times. Even Cornell, the most charismatic front man in alternative rock, 
looked lost. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Danzig, leader of Danzig, since his earliest days in the horror-punk 
Misfits has had a talent for wrapping his mainstream music in extreme 
packaging. In fact, if you hadn't been looking at the 15-foot horned skull the 
band uses as a drum riser -- or listening to the hail-Satan lyrics -- you might 
have mistaken Danzig for a vanilla fluff-metal group instead of the underground 
cult heroes they are. 
</P>
<P>
Danzig's growly voice, like an old blender, has two settings: hi and lo, mostly 
hi, which made for a monotonous set. 
</P>
<P>
When he got to a chorus, big REO-Speedwagon power chords let you know. And he 
plugged his singles and MTV videos between numbers, just like Warrant. This was 
metal -- of the most banal sort.

'MULTICULTURAL MAN' IS HIGH POINT FOR JAPAN AMERICA SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Choreographer Donald Byrd introduced one of his extraordinary works Saturday on 
the "Celebrate California" series at the Japan America Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
In a too-infrequent visit to the Southland, Byrd also brought his troupe, the 
Group, to the program split with Lula Washington's Los Angeles Contemporary 
Dance Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd's new piece, "Multicultural Man," is less a solo for him than a 
multivalent collaboration with composer Mio Morales. Morales, dressed in a 
scientist's white frock coat, crazy keyboard-design pants and electronic 
headset, stands juxtaposed to Byrd, who wears a kind of tribal outfit (grass 
skirt, orange jacket and kerchief). 
</P>
<P>
The pairing of technology and primitive culture tips in favor of scientific 
control at first, as Byrd repeats the Svengali-like movements of Morales, whose 
breathing, speech, song and cries are electronically manipulated to provide the 
sound score. But new relationships emerge between them, and throughout, Byrd's 
strength and vulnerability prove compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Morales also composed the music for "Bolla Blu," a battle-between-the-sexes 
duet introduced to Los Angeles and danced with power and sensitivity by Ruthlyn 
Salomons and Juca Dumont. 
</P>
<P>
Also new to Los Angeles was Byrd's "What Makes Samantha . . ." a continuation 
of his rich exploration of ballet, with Wendi Lees Beckwitt as the punk 
ballerina, Jeremy Lemme as the flying imp and Andre George and Robert 
Logan-Mayo as other partners. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Washington offered works that dug into ideas, but not too deeply. 
"Tasting Muddy Waters," her solo now passed on to daughter Tamica Washington, 
at one point suggests sexual allure as a strategy against the chains of 
slavery, but ends in a shallow, sensual strut. 
</P>
<P>
Her new group piece, "Raw" (to music performed live by Robert Dale) attempts to 
evoke the problem of narcissistic fixation; even so, Washington's spoken 
remark, "South Africa is still not free," emerged as an appendage. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's "A Duke for the '90s," previously reviewed, completed the program.

A GIFTED, ORIGINAL GUITARIST JOINS FRIESEN AT MCCABE'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A surprise was in store for the few dozen David Friesen fans who showed up 
Friday at McCabe's. The bassist's partner was Uwe Kropinski, a guitarist who 
defected three years ago from East Berlin to Cologne. 
</P>
<P>
Not since Stanley Jordan has a guitarist offered such an array of original 
ideas. Kropinski plays both gut-string and steel-string guitars, alternates 
between finger style and plectrum solos, and, like Jordan, is capable of 
playing with his left hand only. 
</P>
<P>
His guitars are equipped with additional high-register frets that extend beyond 
the O-holes of the instruments. Kropinski uses this extra range to create 
dazzling octave-jumping runs. 
</P>
<P>
Most remarkable of all is his use of the guitar as a percussion medium. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of merely tapping on wood, he creates complex rhythms, often with both 
hands, that would defy the ingenuity of most bongo players. At times he would 
switch back and forth between lightning guitar lines and wild percussion 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
On one tune, Friesen played a bowed solo on his curious Oregon bass while 
Kropinski went into a right-hand tremolo that never let up for two or three 
minutes, while his left hand changed chords continuously. 
</P>
<P>
During the second set, the duo's novelty aspect went overboard. Friesen tried 
to show that he too could be a percussionist, on the sounding board of his 
bass; he tried to play a Shakuhachi flute, then indulged in grotesque "Laughing 
Bass" sound effects with his bow. Kropinski, wetting his fingers, stroked the 
guitar to simulate the wound of a Brazilian cuica. 
</P>
<P>
The repertoire, consisting of originals by Friesen and Kropinski, involved some 
clever interplay between the two men but generally was less interesting than 
the spontaneous inventions by this fascinating German visitor. 
</P>
<P>
His visa expires soon, but it seems inevitable that he will return to establish 
himself as the sensation in this country that he has already become in Europe.

JARVI, GOLABEK IN BOWL BEETHOVEN SPECTACULAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some words get overused. At Hollywood Bowl for the last 22 summers, spectacular 
has been worked over regularly and frequently. But some nights, the word is 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, at the first of two performances of the sometimes annual Beethoven 
Spectacular, the fireworks show at the Bowl lived up to its advance billing. 
</P>
<P>
Multicolored visions, kaleidoscopic lighting effects and splashes of lively 
images in the night sky reawakened one observer's visual imagination. 
</P>
<P>
No matter that the aural subject of this vivid show-for-the-eye was the 
composer's embarrassing pastiche, "Wellington's Victory." It worked, 
nonetheless, in tandem with the Los Angeles Philharmonic's careful treatment of 
this meretricious material. Michael Hackett staged the work, using costumed 
soldiers, swordsmen, townspeople and, of course, cannons. 
</P>
<P>
And the preceding performances, also conducted by Neeme Jarvi in his fifth and 
final Bowl program of the summer, proved similarly circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
Most jolly was Mona Golabek's stylish and authoritative playing of the 
wonderful solo part in the composer's "Choral" Fantasy, in which she, Jarvi and 
the Philharmonic were assisted by the Los Angeles Master Chorale. It's a part 
that thrills pianists and mystifies everyone else, but genuine Beethoven 
nonetheless, and, in its way, terrifically grateful for the soloist. With her 
usual panache, Golabek made it live. 
</P>
<P>
Violinist Mark Baranov was the other soloist of the evening, stepping out of 
his seat in the orchestra to play the Romance in G (on Saturday, Mark Kashper 
was scheduled to play the F-major Romance at this spot in the program), which 
he did with neatness and elegance, if some timidity. The evening, reportedly 
attended by 17,753 listeners, began with a bright run-through of the Third 
"Leonore" Overture. DANIEL CARIAGA

KID BEAT: SERENDIPITY AT THE CORONET: A YEAR-ROUND CHILDREN'S THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles will finally have a full-time, year-round resident professional 
children's theater in a permanent space. 
</P>
<P>
The Coronet Theatre, a mid-size Equity house in West Hollywood, will become 
home to the Serendipity Theatre Company in August. 
</P>
<P>
That announcement was made by Jody Davidson, executive director of the newly 
formed children's theater, who is leaving her job as general manager of the 
Laguna Moulton Playhouse in Laguna Beach, as of Dec. 30. The Serendipity 
artistic director will be her husband, Scott Davidson, who will leave his post 
as youth theater artistic director at Laguna Moulton on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The Davidsons plan to begin contract negotiations this week with Actors' 
Equity. They will take possession of the Coronet on Aug. 10, in preparation for 
an October opening. 
</P>
<P>
The initial season includes Judy Blume's "Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing," 
Arnold Lobel's "Frog and Toad," Aurand Harris' "Androcles and the Lion," Suzan 
Zeder's "Doors" and a Chinese version of "Nightingale." There will also be a 
Christmas show, "Merry Christmas, Strega Nona." 
</P>
<P>
"It has always astounded me that in the heart of the entertainment industry, 
there is no full-time professional theater for youth," Jody Davidson said. 
"You've got communities much smaller than Los Angeles that have generated some 
of the best children's theater in the country: Minneapolis, Seattle, Honolulu, 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to produce quality children's theater in a major area," she said, 
"but we've been on hold with our plans because a facility was not available. 
When we found out the Coronet had become available, it was fate." 
</P>
<P>
Coronet owner Petrie Robie explained why she picked Serendipity as her 
leaseholder: "I need consistency. Jody Davidson was the first person who showed 
she was not just talking. She's a realist, she's very credible and she has a 
theatrical background. It may not be mainstream theater, but I think it's going 
to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Robie said people don't remember that "very good children's theater came out of 
the Coronet" when it was first built in 1946 by her mother. "She wrote, 
produced and trained young people, so it's kind of come around again, and I 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother's still living," Robie added quietly, "but she has Alzheimer's 
disease, so it's too bad that she won't know about it." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson said that the Coronet Theatre is in a "prime area, central to the 
industry and to communities where parents are supportive of the arts. It's a 
nice area where people can bring their children and feel reasonably secure. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are going to try it. Then it'll be up to the quality of our 
work to hold them." Serendipity won't be an "elitist" organization, she added. 
"Ticket prices will allow families to buy a season without breaking their 
backs." 
</P>
<P>
A full six-play season will cost $50 per adult and $30 per child. A three-play 
subscription is also planned. Individual ticket prices will be $6 per child, 
$10 per adult. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going for a variety of theater styles, subject matter and sources, and 
we're working with scripts by some of the best new playwrights, with classics 
and adaptations of modern children's classics," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a strong network with playwrights and other producing organizations. 
'Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing' is coming to us from the Seattle Children's 
Theater, 'Frog and Toad' from the Emmy Gifford Theatre in Omaha. We're working 
to get the rights to another show from the Minneapolis Children's Theater." 
</P>
<P>
The Davidsons refused to talk about their break with the Laguna Playhouse, but 
Scott Davidson said that he's looking forward to being in a theater "strictly 
devoted to children's theater, as opposed to being a facility where you're the 
second or third cousin and if something else comes up you get bumped to a 
lesser facility." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Playhouse business manager Katy Realista said that the Davidsons left to 
go "on to bigger and better things. It was time for them to move on. The youth 
theater was outgrowing its space here. They needed more weekends -- the main 
stage sells out 97% of each year," and a planned second theater "never came 
through." 
</P>
<P>
Jody Davidson stressed that she and her husband are not first-timers in the 
field. She has a master's degree in children's theater, 10 years of creative 
and administrative experience with the Rainbow Company youth theater that she 
created in Las Vegas, and more than four years in Laguna as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Davidson acted and taught at the Rainbow company. Under his tenure in 
Laguna as children's theater artistic director, the Laguna Playhouse Youth 
Theatre was named the outstanding new amateur children's theater of 1989 by the 
American Alliance for Theatre and Education.

THE OUTRAGEOUS 'RIVERA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There ought to be a good film in the life of Diego Rivera. He was one of those 
over-life-size artists who erupted from the soil of modernism. His voracious 
ego and appetite matched Picasso's even if his talent did not. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his penchant for igniting scandal, Rivera was one of the most 
popular and notorious of the revolutionary Mexican muralists, but his 
reputation fell into the shadows after his death in 1957. His style, like that 
of Thomas Hart Benton, was stigmatized as a throwback. His communism did not 
play well in McCarthy's America. 
</P>
<P>
Today the climate has reversed. Communism appears on the brink of quaintness. 
Art has re-engaged politics and feminism discovered the quirky genius of 
Rivera's third wife, Frida Kahlo. Their story, not unlike that of Jackson 
Pollock and Lee Krasner, crackles with infidelity (mainly his), obsessive love 
and masochistic self-sacrifice (mainly hers). 
</P>
<P>
It's the stuff of contemporary historical drama so you'd think an enterprising 
documentary filmmaker could make something of it. Mary Lance and Eric Breitbart 
have tried in the hourlong "Diego Rivera: I Paint What I See" (through Tuesday 
at the Nuart). Artniks will attend because it is the first film profile of the 
artist. Everybody else might want to wait until it turns up on television -- it 
has that sort of scale. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera was an an outrageous embroiderer of his own legend. Perhaps that's why 
the filmmakers took such an over-corrective, flat-fact approach to the story. 
There's a lot of wonderful vintage footage of Rivera and Kahlo, of Cubist Paris 
and revolutionary Mexico. We see the obese, pop-eyed artist at work on the 
Rockefeller Center mural that would be destroyed for including a portrait of 
Lenin, as well as the Detroit mural that was saved by a member of the 
capitalist Ford family. 
</P>
<P>
There's a real historical charge in seeing Leon Trotsky as Rivera's house guest 
in Mexico and real poignancy in watching the tiny, crippled Kahlo paint. She 
said she did not regard herself as an artist but only worked to have something 
to do while Diego was busy with his brush and his bimbos. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Lance and Breitbart were trying for the kind of laconic tension that 
"Frontline" gets with its monosyllabic voiceover. Maybe they were intimidated 
into excessive conventionality by their monstrous, fascinating subject. Funny, 
a recent feature film on Kahlo called "Frida" captured all the fetid hedonistic 
poetry of their intimate lives but lost the facts in a sea of surrealism. Maybe 
a nice double bill would provide us and opportunity to blend them in the Mix 
Master of the mind.

GEORGIA SATELLITES HAVE YET TO REACH POTENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the unaffected good-rockin' they may represent, the sad truth is that 
most actual bar bands are numbingly commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly some groups elevate party music to a high art, but the Georgia 
Satellites at first didn't seem to be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
When this band hit in 1986, it seemed unworthy of the attention brought by its 
left-field hit "Keep Your Hands to Yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The Satellites' Saturday Coach House show, however, had moments that suggested 
the quartet may yet attain the sublime. 
</P>
<P>
While the songwriting, singing and playing that went into the 24-song show 
didn't offer much in the way of individuality or virtuosity, some points go to 
Rick Richards for his snarling slide guitar work, which helped pump plenty of 
spirit into several of the songs. 
</P>
<P>
The Beatles' "Don't Pass Me By" became a hard-rocking hot rod in their hands, 
matched by their own "Shake That Thing" and "Saddle Up." 
</P>
<P>
Richards fronted a smoldering ballad version of the current "All Over but the 
Cryin' " while co-singer/guitarist Dan Baird led an uproarious, free-flying 
"Dan Takes Five." 
</P>
<P>
If more of the band's delivery was as unfettered, the Satellites might vie for 
greatness, but those moments were spread thin over a two-hour show. 
</P>
<P>
And it was ultimately fatiguing hearing a group whose cultural matrix begins 
and ends with the Faces. JIM WASHBURN

'PROBLEM CHILD' SHRIEKS BUT DOESN'T AMUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Junior Healy, of "Problem Child" (which opened citywide Friday), is the Kid 
from Hell, an evil-minded 8-year-old who wreaks havoc everywhere: setting fire 
to his bedroom, torturing cats, shooing wild bears onto his camp mates and 
unleashing an escaped serial killer on his whole adoptive family. 
</P>
<P>
The film begins with a frenzied montage where he's progressively dropped in a 
basket on four successive doorsteps -- all increasingly lower on the 
socioeconomic scale -- and finally stowed at an orphanage, where he tries to 
incite food riots and mutilate nuns. 
</P>
<P>
Sound funny? The filmmakers here think so. They've jacked this loud, lame 
shrieker of a movie up to the highest decibels, both aural and visual, and 
rammed it in our faces with almost numbing aplomb. All the actors are snowed 
under, including that normally empathic farceur, John Ritter -- though Michael 
Oliver (as Junior) actually has moments and Jack Warden (as irascible Gramps 
Healy), walks through this atrocity with the offhand contempt it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
The movie begins with Junior urinating all over his first prospective foster 
parent -- he has great aim for a baby -- and ends with a low-angle shot of 
cow-dung about to be dropped right in our faces. That about sums up the humor 
at the writers' disposal: Their joke repertoire seems limited to No. 1 and No. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
In between the scatological drollery, the writers (Scott Alexander and Larry 
Karaszewski) try to mainline a little "heart" into things, by setting up a 
struggle for Junior's affections between his good, kind, liberal, 
there's-no-such-thing-as-a-bad-boy dad (Ritter), and the Bow Tie Killer, a 
grungy homicidal maniac (Michael Richards) to whom Junior has been writing fan 
letters since his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"Problem Child" (MPAA rated PG -- an absurd judgment about which parents should 
think twice) plays like a long, rich-kid nightmare. At one point, it's 
suggested that Ritter's Ben is being horribly mistreated because he won't get 
to inherit his dad's money and land. Given the moral level of this movie, 
disinheritance may pass for a mortal sin, while serial killing is only a "cute" 
venial one.

U.S. AUTHORITIES FEAR DRUG ROUTES ARE SHIFTING TO WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS JEHL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ALAMEDA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South America's cocaine smugglers are moving their U.S. operations westward in 
an attempt to catch American drug interdiction forces off-balance, according to 
military and law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
The most brazen example of the shift showed up on U.S. radar screens in April, 
when U.S. Customs Service scanners spotted an unprecedented five-plane convoy 
of Colombian drug planes taking off to the west and heading over the Pacific 
Ocean on the way to Mexican landing sites within striking distance of the U.S. 
border. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no indication yet that the smugglers have begun using the new 
route directly to penetrate the United States, authorities concede that the 
drug lords' ploy is posing a major challenge to U.S. enforcement efforts. With 
previous drug smuggling operations concentrated primarily in the Caribbean, 
America's drug war defenses have been skewed badly out of balance, with far 
more resources allocated to the Atlantic staging area than to the Pacific back 
door. 
</P>
<P>
A new Pacific-based military task force established here last year primarily to 
guard against heroin smugglers at sea has had to call for help from an Air 
Force base in Oklahoma simply to obtain the AWACS radar planes needed to patrol 
the new cocaine hot spot off Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
The makeshift arrangement may already be showing the strain. In the April 19 
assault, only a lone AWACS aircraft was available to scramble after the five 
drug-smuggling planes, and it lost track of three of them when the convoy split 
up over the Gulf of California. 
</P>
<P>
The American plane did help guide Mexican authorities to the two remaining 
planes. But U.S. officials warn that their already-limited resources are being 
stretched thin: The sophisticated Oklahoma-based radar plane was running short 
on fuel, and no reinforcement was available. 
</P>
<P>
"He was low on gas, and he had to head home," a counternarcotics official 
shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
But now, with the military taking the lead role in America's effort to detect 
and monitor narcotics traffic worldwide, the shortcomings in U.S. surveillance 
in the Pacific raise new questions about the Pentagon's ability to adapt to new 
enemy tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the steady increase in smuggling traffic, the Alameda-based Joint Task 
Force 5 controls no AWACS (Advanced Warning Airborne Command System) aircraft 
at all and has only one four-ship naval task group that is dedicated to drug 
interdiction -- all this in a territory that covers 100 million square miles of 
ocean from the West Coast to India. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the permanent lookout in the Caribbean includes four Puerto 
Rico-based AWACS planes and at least two Navy task groups, which stop and 
search dozens of suspicious-looking vessels each month. The unit received more 
than $30 million in supplemental financing this year -- providing it with 
nearly double the funding that its Pacific counterpart receives. 
</P>
<P>
In his headquarters on the shore of San Francisco Bay, the Joint Task Force 5 
commander, Coast Guard Adm. William P. Leahy, insists that his superiors at the 
Pacific Command have given him all the tools he needs to do the job. But the 
crusty admiral warns that "if we don't push back the cocaine and look out to 
the west of us," heroin will be flooding in as well. 
</P>
<P>
Other military experts agree. In the current issue of Proceedings, a leading 
Navy journal, Navy Cmdr. William J. Lahneman noted that the ability of the 
joint task force to undertake significant anti-drug surveillance "depends on 
its ability to obtain permanent control of a number of suitable platforms." 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the Navy officer noted with understatement, "allocations have been 
small." 
</P>
<P>
And other military officials familiar with the region say the mounting pressure 
from the south has already caused the Pacific-based task force to limit its 
scope, concentrating most of its missions on a handful of anti-cocaine patrols 
off the coast of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In its first year of operations, the four-ship task group -- which constitutes 
the military's primary force for interdicting heroin shipments -- has stopped 
fewer than 20 suspect vessels. None was carrying drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawaii-based Pacific Command declined to provide details of the operations 
on grounds that its missions are classified. Leahy says only that the 
stop-and-search operations -- which were carried out in international waters 
off the United States and Mexico -- focused on vessels that met a "profile" for 
drug smugglers or were targeted by intelligence information. 
</P>
<P>
But Leahy points out that U.S. personnel have been intercepting more drug 
vessels -- with four operations in the last month alone. And he argues that the 
improvement in military intelligence efforts is enabling enforcement officials 
to keep tabs on heroin shipments even during periods when ships and planes are 
concentrated on cocaine smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
"I have assets that don't float or fly. . . ." Leahy said. "We're responding to 
whatever we have to respond to." 
</P>
<P>
The admiral conceded that task force operations have not been stepped up at all 
in recent months. That appears to contradict what the Pentagon earlier this 
year announced as a major upsurge in anti-drug sailing and steaming hours in 
the region. The Pacific Command refused -- for security reasons -- to provide 
more details on where intensified operations are taking place. 
</P>
<P>
Critics are concerned that a beleaguered task force may have too little time to 
focus on vessels carrying heroin from South Asia's Golden Triangle, where a 
recent explosion in opium production has already sent shipments to the United 
States soaring. 
</P>
<P>
Also potentially worrisome to counternarcotics officials is that traffickers 
may begin using the new Pacific route to fly cocaine directly into the West 
Coast, as they once did into the Southeast and Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't happened yet. An estimated 70% of U.S. cocaine supplies is routed 
through landing strips in northern Mexico. But the shift still represents a 
fundamental step in sending the flights on an arduous journey up the long -- 
and remote -- west coast of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The diversionary ploys by the smugglers aren't new. Drug traffickers frequently 
have been able to change their tactics more quickly than the United States has 
been able to respond. 
</P>
<P>
Smugglers who in the early 1980s plied the waters and airways of southern 
Florida found an alternative staging area in Bahamian keys after they were 
driven offshore by an American law-enforcement crackdown. When Colombian 
cartels later diverted drug flights toward new access points in northern 
Mexico, American anti-drug forces were still concentrating on interdiction in 
the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the latest shift westward may signal a new wave of increasingly 
sophisticated and long-range smuggling operations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not quite a true flip-flop," says Paul F. Nelepovitz, the Customs Service 
liaison to Joint Task Force 5. "But it's a significant increase with a 
significant decrease on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
Despite stepped-up surveillance near Colombia by the Panama-based U.S. Southern 
Command, the region remains out of routine range of American military patrols 
-- particularly the Air Force AWACS, which are the military's most effective 
weapons against airborne smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the gap is that, mainly because of Mexican political 
sensitivities, U.S. drug enforcement patrols have not been as aggressive in 
patrolling the area around Mexico. So delicate is the situation there that U.S. 
officials even refuse to provide any details about patrols conducted in 
international airspace off the Mexican coast. 
</P>
<P>
And, with no AWACS planes regularly on station on the Pacific Coast, the task 
force must plead with the Colorado-based North American Aerospace Defense 
Command (NORAD) in Colorado for even temporary use of the plane based in 
Oklahoma, which itself is several hours' flying time from the coast. 
</P>
<P>
The Customs Service has an alternative advanced radar plane, the P-3 AEW, 
equally far afield in Corpus Christi, Tex., that has been permitted to take a 
shortcut to the Pacific through approved Mexican air corridors. But there are 
some suggestions that the Mexican government recently revoked that permission. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, U.S. commanders now rely primarily on less-effective Navy E-2s 
based at North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego for the offshore sweeps 
designed to track Colombian flights as they make their way up the Mexican 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
And even when luck is with them, drug raiders often find that the paucity of 
resources can limit their options severely -- as it did on April 19, when the 
radar operators aboard a Customs Service P-3 AEW based in Panama first spotted 
the five-plane drug convoy leaving Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
According to NORAD officials, drug force commanders dispatched a borrowed AWACS 
operating over San Diego to a position south of Baja California, where its 
radar soon picked up the track of the oncoming Colombian planes. 
</P>
<P>
The AWACS plane maintained its vigil as the targets headed over the Gulf of 
California, still flying in a tight group. The cluster broke apart as the 
planes neared Hermosillo, in mainland Mexico, and the AWACS relayed coordinates 
that guided a joint team of Mexican authorities and U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents to their landing site. The take: two planes and nearly 
3,000 pounds of cocaine. NORAD officials say the other three planes were "lost" 
-- disappearing from the 250-mile-radius radar and presumed to have landed. 
</P>
<P>
But other military officials suggested that the AWACS, now short of fuel and 
unable to call in reinforcements, was unable to conduct a full search -- 
unintentionally enabling the quarry to get away. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy insists there could have been "many reasons" for the lapse, but another 
official is not as politic. "Let's put it this way," he said, "if there had 
been as many AWACS out West as in the Atlantic, they might well have had better 
luck."

Cocaine: The Westward Shift 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine smugglers have begun shifting much of their trade westward to the 
Pacific in an attempt to expoit American vulnerabilities along the West Coast, 
military and law enforcement officials say. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Air Force radar operators were stunned in mid-April when their screens 
showed an unprecedented five-plane convoy of Colombian drug planes taking off 
to the west and heading over the ocean on the way to Mexican landing sites with 
striking distance of the U.S. border. 
</P>
<P>
While military AWACS aircraft are permanently based in Puerto Rico to combat 
Caribbean smuggling, the military was not prepared for the Pacific Coast 
activity.

LEGISLATORS DIDN'T SEE LOOMING BUDGET CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: THEY FAILED TO TAKE THE PROBLEM SERIOUSLY ENOUGH SOON ENOUGH, MANY OF 
THEM NOW ADMIT.

<P>
Bitter, weary and heavily criticized after creating havoc by missing the state 
budget deadline by six weeks, many legislators now admit they did not take 
their problem seriously enough soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We failed early-on to recognize the depth of our problem and our limited 
number of options," conceded Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, 
echoing the view of many colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-three days after they had been required by the state Constitution to pass 
a budget for the fiscal year that began July 1, the Legislature finally, 
grudgingly broke its record deadlock late Saturday night and sent a compromise 
$55-billion spending plan to Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
That tardy action, coupled with Deukmejian's signing of the budget sometime 
before Wednesday, will assure the state government's legal authority to again 
write checks and end the paralysis that has gripped the Capitol for a month. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the lawmakers passed a budget that looks very much like proposals 
that had floated around the Capitol for weeks. It will provide the full funding 
for education that is required in the state Constitution, but it cuts deeply 
into health, welfare and social programs. Business will pay higher taxes 
through changes in state income tax codes, and a variety of fees will hit 
everybody from out-of-state college students to campers at state parks. 
</P>
<P>
The budget-cutting is not over yet. It is anticipated that Deukmejian will 
slice more than $400 million from targeted programs before he signs the budget. 
</P>
<P>
With revenues failing to keep pace with the rising cost of operating the state, 
traditional political positions had to be altered to accommodate a new 
political reality. Republicans, including Deukmejian, had to accept tax 
increases and Democrats had to live with cuts in social programs. It was a hard 
shift that some lawmakers foresee continuing into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"What you see is a new approach to state budgeting for the next 10 years -- 
substantial cuts and new revenues going hand in hand -- that ultimately will 
lead to structural changes, but painfully and slowly," observed Assemblyman 
Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento), who offered the outline of what became the 
final budget. 
</P>
<P>
Maddy agreed. "Isenberg was right," Maddy said. "He saw it (the problem) early. 
He helped convince me that Roberti (Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti 
of Los Angeles) and I should start talking." 
</P>
<P>
How did things get so out of control? Why were the Legislature and the governor 
unable to accomplish what ordinary citizens in private businesses routinely do 
every year in meeting a budget deadline? 
</P>
<P>
There is no single answer, except perhaps for a shortage of leadership in the 
state Capitol. And there is no assurance that the budget-making process won't 
bog down again in the future. Although the politicians failed to see the 
developing crisis, there were plenty of warning signs: 
</P>
<P>
* There was no sense of urgency as the new fiscal year approached. Legislators 
believed they had been through all this before, many times. In seven of the 
previous 12 years, they had routinely ignored deadlines and caused state 
government to enter the new fiscal year without a budget. Government did not 
grind to a halt. Prison gates did not swing open. Freeways did not close. They 
got away with it. When necessary, courts came to the rescue and ordered the 
state to make benefit payments. Most important, no legislator was defeated at 
the polls because a budget had not been passed on time. 
</P>
<P>
* There was the combination of an iron-willed Republican governor -- insisting, 
in his last year in office, on two prisons in Los Angeles County and a 
mechanism to curtail automatic growth in welfare spending -- versus a 
Legislature firmly controlled by combative Democrats. This prescription for 
deadlock is exacerbated by a requirement, which few other states have, that any 
budget or tax bill be passed by a two-thirds vote. Mixed into this quagmire are 
uncompromising, extremist politicians elected in gerrymandered districts 
designed to be safe havens for one party. 
</P>
<P>
* During the critical month of May -- as a $3.6-billion budget deficit emerged 
-- key Democratic legislators turned their attention toward raising campaign 
money to defeat two Republican-backed reapportionment initiatives that 
threatened their ability to retain power. Major legislation, including the 
budget, was all but ignored. Meanwhile, Deukmejian devoted himself to 
campaigning for voter approval of an $18.5-billion transportation package. 
</P>
<P>
* Legislators in recent years had become accustomed to a "May miracle," when a 
looming, projected budget deficit suddenly was transformed into a surprise 
windfall of tax revenues. But no miracle occurred this year. The state's fiscal 
situation only got worse. Faced with cutting programs and raising taxes, 
lawmakers procrastinated. 
</P>
<P>
* Voters, using ballot initiatives, gradually have eroded the power of the 
Legislature and the governor to apportion tax money and raise revenues. This 
started with Proposition 13, which made it much harder to raise taxes, and 
continued with ballot measures imposing government spending limits and 
requiring that 40% of state general fund money be spent on schools. The result 
is that the flexibility of elected representatives has been substantially 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
* A Legislature does not operate like a private business that must make speedy 
decisions in order to survive. For instance, state legislators usually are in 
session only from noon Monday till noon Thursday; then they knock off for a 
long weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, some legislators believe the budget deadlock may have sown the 
seeds necessary to help avoid a similar crisis in the future. They maintain 
that a new "trigger" device imposing automatic cuts when revenues do not meet 
expectations will provide the political impetus to head off a repeat disaster. 
The "trigger" was one of the Democratic concessions to Deukmejian in return for 
the governor's support of tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats also are talking about sponsoring a ballot measure to eliminate 
the two-thirds vote requirement for passage of a budget. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all of the factors leading up to this year's stalemate, if there had 
been stronger leaders able to recognize the danger signs, the crisis probably 
could have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic leadership failed to recognize the seriousness of the dilemma," 
said conservative Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks). "Our party 
failed to identify budget alternatives. The governor can be faulted for 
breaking a very emphatic campaign promise -- 'no new taxes.' " 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Assembly Democratic floor leader Thomas M. Hannigan of 
Fairfield agreed there was a shortage of leadership, particularly when talks 
between Deukmejian and legislative leaders broke off early. "It's difficult to 
solve a budget problem when you do not have all the elements meeting to find a 
solution," Hannigan said. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor contributing to the stalemate was Deukmejian's trademark 
hands-off style in dealing with the Legislature on budget matters. In the past, 
he usually would sit back and wait for the budget to reach his desk, then "blue 
pencil" veto any spending he opposed. This time, he needed the Legislature to 
pass separate bills authorizing certain program cuts -- such as in health and 
welfare benefits -- that he could not legally make on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"The blue pencil didn't work this time," Republican Maddy noted. "The governor 
had to have us. I think that was a key." 
</P>
<P>
A chief obstacle to compromise was the deeply fractured Assembly composed of 
many die-hard ideologues, such as McClintock on the right and liberal 
Democratic Ways and Means Chairman John Vasconcellos of Santa Clara on the 
left. Both represent factions strongly committed to their views and resist 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), frequently 
portrayed by his enemies as the ultimate big-spending liberal, blistered both 
left- and right-wingers. He called their refusal to compromise a "classic case 
in which two extremes can paralyze a democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Adding yet another hurdle to passage of a budget was the so-called "super 
majority," or two-thirds vote requirement. This allows Republicans to block 
passage of the budget unless its demands are met because Democrats do not have 
a two-thirds majority in either house. 
</P>
<P>
Charging that "a small, crazy band of anarchists dictate to a majority of the 
citizens," Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) announced that he will sponsor a 
ballot initiative to reduce the voting requirement to a simple majority. 
Lockyer and others noted that Congress enacts budget bills with a majority 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
One hang-up in trying to reach a compromise was Deukmejian's instance on 
"structural" reforms to eliminate the problem of revenues failing to keep pace 
with the spending habits of a rapidly growing state. He finally settled for the 
"trigger" device, a mechanism that pleased neither conservative Republicans nor 
liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise, patterned after the federal Gramm-Rudman law, automatically 
will enable future governors to cut up to 4% of most state programs when 
projected spending exceeds revenues by at least one-half of 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, legislators reported that their telephone lines during the deadlock 
were burning up with angry calls from state employees, welfare recipients and 
others who depend on a state check for their livelihoods. But there was little 
response from other members of the public, they said.

<P>
Muslim rebels still held the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago and at least 
38 other hostages Sunday as negotiations to end the twin-island nation's crisis 
stalled amid reports of widespread looting and an early morning gun battle at 
one of the hostage sites. 
</P>
<P>
News agencies, quoting an executive of Trinidad's state-owned television 
station, said that Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson had offered to resign and 
call early elections in return for the hostages' freedom. But there was no 
confirmation of that report from other government sources. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Muslim group attempting the coup said that a final 
agreement on amnesty for the armed rebels was close. But a government source 
quoted by the Caribbean News Agency (CANA) in Barbados said that the 
negotiations were snagged over legal terms and by reservations being voiced by 
Trinidad's police and armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
No further mention was made Sunday of reports that Robinson and other hostages 
had been wired to explosive devices and threatened with death in the event of 
any armed rescue attempt. Robinson and 11 Cabinet ministers and members of 
Parliament are captives inside Trinidad's Red House, the Parliament building in 
downtown Port of Spain, the capital. Between 26 and 28 other captives are being 
held in two buildings of the state-run Trinidad and Tobago Television and Radio 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
A gun battle between the police and members of the armed Jamaat al Muslimeen 
rebel group broke out early Sunday at the television station, CANA reported. It 
quoted the station's news director, Jones P. Madeira, himself a hostage, as 
saying that two of the Muslims were wounded. A shortwave radio broadcast, 
purportedly made by Robinson, appealed for a cease-fire, CANA said. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency also quoted extensively from an interview with Yasin abu Bakr, 
leader of Jamaat al Muslimeen, Arabic for "Group of Muslims," in which he 
denied "malicious propaganda" that his movement was supported by Libya's 
radical leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi, and that the rebels had asked to be flown 
to Libya. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we going to Libya for?" the CANA interview quoted Abu Bakr as asking. 
"We are all Trinidadians, that is why we are here, that is why we are fighting 
in any case, because it is our country. There is nothing to do with Libya." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking by telephone to CANA from the television station, Abu Bakr said that 
the armed uprising was launched because "something had to shock us into 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
The offer that Robinson reportedly made to step down and call early elections 
was described by TV news director Madeira, according to an Associated Press 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"My information is that Prime Minister Robinson has agreed to step down and 
that an interim government of major political parties will run the country 
until elections are held in 90 days," Madeira was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson won the parliamentary elections by a landslide in 1986, and the next 
elections are not scheduled until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Bakr's group of 200 to 250 followers and their families, organized about 
six years ago, has long been viewed with suspicion by the government as violent 
outlaws. Abu Bakr, a former police officer in his mid-40s, has in turn accused 
the government of corruption, squandering state money and failing to focus on 
hunger and health care. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Robinson, who was shot in the leg when he refused to sign a 
document that some reports described as a letter of resignation, Abu Bakr told 
CANA, "All is well at the Red House," the Parliament building where the prime 
minister and other officials are held captive. "There has been a great spirit 
of compromise between our members and Mr. Robinson and some of the members of 
Parliament," Abu Bakr was quoted as saying. "Hopefully the country will be back 
on its feet in a couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
Two other political leaders, National Security Minister Selwyn Richardson and 
Parliament member Leo Des Vignes also were shot in the legs, according to a 
news report from Port of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, officials said that U.S. and Trinidadian officials have 
consulted in the past two days on the possibility of sending State Department 
experts in hostage negotiations to the island. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Sean Walsh said Sunday that the United States is "willing 
to entertain any proposal by the government of Trinidad and Tobago, and will 
examine any request carefully." But Walsh said that Trinidad has made no formal 
requests for assistance and that officials in Washington believe that Trinidad 
hopes to resolve the crisis itself. 
</P>
<P>
Any U.S. military assistance was considered highly unlikely, officials said, 
both because Trinidad is not likely to request such help and because Washington 
probably would not approve such a move. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ransacking and pillaging of stores and shopping centers in what 
has become the virtual no man's land of downtown Port of Spain continued 
Sunday, according to news reports reaching here. Acting Police Commissioner 
Leonard Taylor acknowledged that "our best efforts haven't provided the desired 
results," but he warned of "stronger measures which will certainly be injurious 
to some citizens." 
</P>
<P>
In a radio appeal to end the looting, Anglican Bishop Clive Abdullah said he 
had been told that whole convoys of vehicles were loading up on refrigerators 
and videos. 
</P>
<P>
A Port of Spain businessman was quoted as complaining that too many of the tiny 
island country's 1,500 military troops and 5,000 police were concentrated at 
the hostage sites, leaving the city wide open to the looters. As the crisis 
entered its third day, he estimated losses at more than $50 million. At least 
27 people, including police and military personnel, have reportedly been killed 
in the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Abdullah, Roman Catholic Archbishop Anthony Pantin and Anglican 
clergyman Knolly Clarke have been acting as middlemen in the negotiations 
between the Muslim group and the government. In exchange for ending the crisis 
peacefully, the rebels reportedly have asked for a total amnesty, including 
legal pardons from the Commonwealth country's president. 
</P>
<P>
"All the principles have been agreed, and the final arrangements for conducting 
the amnesty are being concluded with the assistance of Archbishop of Port of 
Spain Pantin and Anglican Bishop Abdullah," said the Muslim group's spokesman, 
Bilal Abdullah, in a telephone interview with CANA from the TV station. 
</P>
<P>
A strict 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew continued in Port of Spain. Although Piarco 
International Airport, the country's main link to the outside world, was 
technically reopened during daylight hours Sunday, international and local 
Caribbean airlines refused to resume service until the crisis is resolved. 
Charter pilots on nearby Caribbean islands such as Barbados and Grenada also 
refused to fly to Port of Spain.

California's gasoline price, a slave in recent years to fluctuations in crude 
oil markets and bottlenecks at the nation's refineries, on Wednesday is going a 
nickel-a-gallon higher. 
</P>
<P>
But this time neither flighty markets nor overburdened refineries will shoulder 
the blame. We did it to ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
The increase comes from a voter decision June 5 to approve Proposition 111, a 
ballot measure that triggered a 9-cent-per-gallon hike in gasoline taxes. Five 
cents of that increase will go into effect Wednesday. The rest of the increase 
will be phased in over the next four years with 1-cent tax hikes becoming 
effective every Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
To those who harbor hopes that petroleum retailers or wholesalers will soften 
the financial blow by absorbing some or all of the increase, the answer from 
gasoline dealers is emphatic. 
</P>
<P>
"No way," said John DeWitt, owner of J. E. DeWitt Inc., a gasoline wholesaler 
in South El Monte who also owns some retail stations. "The delivery costs from 
the refinery to the station, trucking costs and overhead, so many government 
rules, regulations and fees make that impossible."

Assn., said a few stations may introduce the tax hike gradually but "you can 
bet in a very short time everybody's going to be up 5 cents a gallon." 
</P>
<P>
So on Wednesday most California motorists will see new prices at their corner 
gas stations. Where the night before self-serve unleaded gas may have sold for 
$1.08 a gallon, or regular for a bargain 99 cents a gallon, prices will be 
$1.13 for unleaded and $1.04 for regular. 
</P>
<P>
"You tell me one other industry that has it prices out there in three-foot-high 
letters on the street," complained Gigoux. "People complain about $1 a gallon 
for gasoline but they think nothing of going into the grocery and spending a 
lot more than that for water in a fancy bottle." 
</P>
<P>
The tax hike was designed by the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian to help 
finance a 10-year, $18.5-billion transportation program that they hope will 
ease traffic congestion, repair crumbling highways and bridges and provide 
better access to rail transit. 
</P>
<P>
For consumers, it means the total federal and state taxes paid on a gallon of 
gasoline in California will be about 30 cents. 
</P>
<P>
It works out this way: Customers already pay a 9-cent federal tax and a 9-cent 
state tax. Then there will be the extra nickel as of Wednesday. But California 
motorists actually pay a tax on a tax in the form of a sales tax, ranging from 
6 1/4% to 7 1/4% depending on the area of the state, that is added on top of 
the state and federal gas taxes. 
</P>
<P>
So in addition to the $5.3 billion in new revenue the state expects to garner 
from the gas tax hike in the next five years, it will also collect $220 million 
from its share of the sales tax that is levied on that tax. 
</P>
<P>
While the new tax is expected to produce some grumbling from customers, Gigoux 
said the real complaints are coming from gasoline distributors who must forward 
the tax to the State Board of Equalization, the agency responsible for 
collecting it. 
</P>
<P>
He said the new tax contributes to cash flow concerns because distributors pay 
the tax before they deliver gasoline, but they may not be paid by the 
commercial account that receives the delivery for another 10 to 30 days. An 
additional tax, he said, means that much more they have to carry until payment 
is made. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an additional strain on an already strained cash flow," said DeWitt. 
"The industry is already operating with a lot of trusses and unfortunately when 
you get another injury, sometimes there aren't enough trusses to hold it in." 
</P>
<P>
But neither DeWitt nor Gigoux expect the tax hike to have any effect on the 
habits of the buying public. "Mom is still going to go play bridge, pop's going 
to take the kid to Little League and he's still going to go to his Saturday 
golf game," said Gigoux. 
</P>
<P>
By now, both say, California customers are accustomed to price changes prompted 
by the rise and fall of crude oil costs and a shortage of refinery capacity 
that often makes the petroleum processing plants unable to keep pace with 
demand. While prices have fluctuated over the last few years, American 
Automobile Assn. surveys show a slight rise in California since Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
At the Board of Equalization, officials do not expect any major problems to 
develop with collections as the new tax increase goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on our past experience, we expect it all to go smoothly," said Delena 
Bratton, tax service specialist for the board. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the state increased the gas tax was in 1983 when it went up 2 
cents, from 7 to 9 cents a gallon.

AMERICAN ALBUM: WHO'S ON FIRST? NO QUICK ANSWERS IN THIS GAMEIN THE FINNISH

There were lots of reasons why Jimmy Piersall was known as a flake back when he 
played major league baseball, but one of the best came the day he hit a home 
run as a New York Met and ran the bases backwards. 
</P>
<P>
All of which has little to do with the subject of this story except to 
illustrate the maxim that what may seem like buffoonery in one setting could 
make perfect sense in another. Had Piersall been playing in, say, Helsinki 
rather than Queens, he might have fit right in. 
</P>
<P>
Yes. Baseball has been Finlandized. 
</P>
<P>
The Finns call the game pesapallo and are so crazy about it that it's 
considered their national pastime. Of course they do it a little differently. 
They don't actually backpedal their way from base to base ala Piersall but, 
looking at it from a chauvinist American perspective, they do take a backwards 
route around the basepaths. 
</P>
<P>
First base is where third base ought to be, second is sort of around where 
first should be and third is somewhere out in left field. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, Abbott. Who isn't on first. I Don't Know is. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Finnish emigres have spread the game to Scandinavia, Canada and even 
Australia. And over the weekend they took their first crack at the toughest 
market of all -- the United States, the guarantor of all that is pure and noble 
about baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Michigan's rugged Upper Peninsula, the heart of Finnish America, two 
Canadian pesapallo teams squared off Saturday in a demonstration game before 
thousands of slightly befuddled spectators at an ethnic festival. In a real 
slugfest, the Toronto Sisu eked out a 16-15 win over the archrival Thunder Bay 
Repais. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the annual FinnFest say that they hope to field enough domestic 
talent to stage home-grown pesapallo matches at future gatherings. Already, the 
Hancock High School baseball coach is talking about teaching the Finnish 
version to his team. 
</P>
<P>
The main selling point of pesapallo, devotees say, is action. There are no long 
pauses between pitches, the ball is almost constantly in play and both fielders 
and runners are forever scampering all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
"In American baseball, a runner on second is in scoring position but in our 
game he's just tired," winked Jari Leinonen, who plays for the Repais. "Usually 
when we get out there, we pack a lunch." 
</P>
<P>
The Abner Doubleday of Finland was Lauri Pihkala, a professor who apparently 
was mesmerized by baseball during early 20th-Century study tours in the United 
States. He combined the American game with some native ball-playing sports and 
pesapallo was born. 
</P>
<P>
Both baseball and pesapallo feature four bases, three outs an inning, nine 
innings, nine players on a side, a hard ball, mitts and a bat -- although the 
Louisville Slugger of Finland is called a Jarvinen Kanuuna. It's also safe to 
say that neither game will have Roseanne Barr sing the opening anthem in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
That's where the similarities end. The pesapallo pitcher, for instance, stands 
next to the plate and tosses the ball up in the air, varying his delivery not 
with curves or sliders but by the height the ball goes. (Orel Hershiser please 
note: if the shoulder surgery doesn't work, a career could still beckon in 
Finland.) 
</P>
<P>
Instead of waiting in a dugout, teammates of the batter stand around what's 
roughly equivalent to the batter's box and scream out advice whether to swing 
or not at a pitch. The batter can hit as many as three fair balls before he has 
to run. And the route around the basepaths sort of zigzags first to the left, 
then the right, then the left again. 
</P>
<P>
Confused? Try this. A three-base hit is a kunnari, or home run. The batter 
scores, even though he's allowed to stay on third and score again if somebody 
knocks him in. But getting a kunnari is not easy because a ball that's knocked 
out of the park -- about 300 feet from home to the farthest point of the 
pesapallo outfield -- is considered a laiton (foul). 
</P>
<P>
When an outfielder catches a fly ball, that doesn't necessarily mean the batter 
is out. He might just be haava (wounded), a sort of purgatory state for 
sluggers that requires them to forfeit the turn at bat but doesn't exactly 
count toward ending the inning. And when someone does make an out, he's not 
just out, he's pallo (killed). This is no game for wimps, that's for sure. 
</P>
<P>
There's one other important difference. At the end of the game, American 
ballplayers hit the showers. "When we're done," said Thunder Bay shortstop 
Pavli Kaki, "we go off to the sauna."

SEEKING POLITICAL ADVANTAGE: Some liberal Democrats and abortion-rights 
activists are gearing up for a major effort to challenge Judge David H. 
Souter's nomination to the Supreme Court, but their leaders concede they will 
be hard-pressed to block the appointment. Instead, they will try to create an 
issue for state election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
While Souter has kept his personal opinions to himself, many abortion-rights 
advocates assume that the New Hampshire judge's conservatism will mean trouble 
for them, and plan a vigorous fight against his nomination, if only to build 
political capital for campaigns for state offices and congressional seats. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to hold him up as an example of what can happen if we're not diligent 
on Election Day," one key strategist says. One potential target: the North 
Carolina U.S. Senate race, pitting Republican incumbent Jesse Helms against 
Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt. 
</P>
<P>
California's Sen. Alan Cranston, for one, believes his fellow Democrats are on 
the right track. "Wherever there is a reasonably close Senate race in which a 
vote for Souter was cast (by the Republican incumbent), it will give an 
advantage to Democrats," Cranston says. 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET BLUES: White House budget strategists are becoming increasingly worried 
that President Bush will have to order sharp cuts in federal spending, as 
required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, on Oct. 1. Such a move 
could eventually spark a political firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Bush's veiled threat to keep Congress in session through late summer to 
pursue efforts to reach agreement on the federal budget, Democrats showed 
little sign of being able to agree among themselves on a counter offer to the 
White House's opening gambit late last week -- proposals to increase taxes on 
alcoholic beverages and to limit deductions on federal tax returns for state 
and local taxes paid. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, lawmakers proposed to convene budget negotiators for a few sessions 
during the August congressional recess, but House Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.) has privately expressed fear that a compromise might not be 
reached before October -- too late to avoid mandatory spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing isn't going well," one budget-watcher says. "What we need here 
is a crisis -- and we may not get one until it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
MORE THAN ROUTINE: Let's Make a Deal may be the theme at the State Department 
on Aug. 9 and 10, when Secretary of State James A. Baker III has his first 
formal meeting with Israel's new foreign minister, David Levy. 
</P>
<P>
Although the session is billed as a get-acquainted meeting, U.S. officials say 
it is of more than routine significance. Levy, with an important domestic 
political base of his own, may hold the key to jump-starting the stalled Middle 
East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
By U.S. standards, Levy is hardly a peacenik when it comes to policy toward the 
Arab states, but at home he is regarded as a man who, like Baker, is willing to 
compromise.

ARMENIANS DEFY GORBACHEV'S DECREE ON SURRENDERING ARMS

Armenian lawmakers have voted to defy President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's decree 
that armed groups must turn in their weapons and disband, a local activist said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers Saturday gave preliminary approval to a resolution that would suspend 
Gorbachev's decree on Armenian territory, as well as in the disputed region of 
Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, according to a spokesman for the Armenian 
National Movement. 
</P>
<P>
The measure will be discussed further at the legislative session today, said 
the spokesman in a telephone interview from Armenia's capital of Yerevan. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who declined to give his name, said the lawmakers believe the 
presidential decree contradicts the Armenian constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev issued a decree Wednesday giving illegally armed militants across the 
country 15 days to turn in their weapons or risk having them confiscated by 
local police, officials of the republics or Interior Ministry troops. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin said Friday that if armed groups 
disobeyed the order, military force would be used. He referred specifically to 
armed groups in Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Armenia, Bakatin said illegally armed groups also operate in Moldavia, 
Georgia, Azerbaijan, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the republic of Georgia, hundreds of protesters demanding 
immediate registration of political groups for multi-party elections were 
blocking trains at a railroad hub. 
</P>
<P>
The protest, which began Thursday, has stranded 30 passenger trains and 90 
freight trains laden with wheat, oil, sugar, meat and gasoline at the Samtredia 
railway junction of the trans-Caucasian railroad, the Communist Party newspaper 
Pravda said. 
</P>
<P>
The junction is about 125 miles northwest of Tbilisi, the Georgian capital. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters -- numbering about 700, according to the unofficial Postfactum 
news service -- are demanding that the Georgian Parliament convene immediately 
to adopt a law to register groups for Oct. 28 elections.

VACATIONING HUNGARIANS SKIP ELECTION

The nation's Socialists lost their bid for a political comeback Sunday when 
voters killed a referendum on direct presidential elections by failing to go to 
the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Coming at the height of summer vacation season and on a brilliantly sunny day 
with temperatures in the 90s, the issue opposed by Hungary's main political 
parties had been considered to have little chance of passage. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 14% of the country's 7.8 million eligible voters cast their ballots 
on whether the head of state should be popularly elected. That turnout was far 
short of the 50% needed for validation, although a solid majority of those who 
did show up voted in favor of direct elections. 
</P>
<P>
With 80% of the vote counted by midnight, 86% had supported direct elections. 
</P>
<P>
The center-right governing coalition under Prime Minister Jozsef Antall had 
opposed holding a direct presidential election, arguing that another campaign 
would be too time-consuming and costly. 
</P>
<P>
The governing Hungarian Democratic Forum and the main opposition force, the 
Alliance of Free Democrats, were in unusual agreement on the issue, apparently 
joining forces to prevent the Socialists -- formerly the Communists -- from 
gaining the prestigious, though largely ceremonial office of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
A recent public opinion poll showed former Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth, a 
Socialist reformer, to be the most popular politician in Hungary, trailed by 
his successor, Antall. 
</P>
<P>
Nemeth and Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn, the former foreign 
minister, were considered likely candidates and potential winners in the event 
voters were asked to choose the president. 
</P>
<P>
While the Socialists hold less than 10% of the seats in Parliament, individual 
members like Nemeth and Horn, who spearheaded Hungary's peaceful "revolution 
from above" to oust hard-line communism, remain respected and influential 
figures in the eyes of voters. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarians had endorsed the idea of direct elections for the presidency in a 
November referendum, although they agreed to put off the vote until after the 
parliamentary ballot conducted in March and April. 
</P>
<P>
But once the Parliament was seated in May, the Forum and the Free Democrats 
orchestrated a behind-the-scenes deal to install writer Arpad Goncz as interim 
president and change the constitution to give Parliament the right to appoint 
the head of state in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Goncz, a Free Democrat, enjoys support across party lines because of his role 
in the 1956 Hungarian uprising against communism, for which he was jailed by 
the Communists for six years. Goncz is expected to be named official head of 
state, now that the bid for popular election has failed. 
</P>
<P>
Socialist and independent members of Parliament pushed for Sunday's referendum, 
in the hopes that the public would demand that it be allowed to choose the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
An independent member of Parliament, Zoltan Kiraly, organized the collection of 
170,000 signatures, forcing the issue to a public referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Kiraly had been considered a contender. But after being accused of pursuing 
personal ambitions to be president in pressing for the referendum, Kiraly told 
Parliament last month that he would not run if voters chose to have direct 
elections.

HOUSING PROPOSED FOR SOVIET IMMIGRANTS; 
</P>

<P>
Housing Minister Ariel Sharon introduced his controversial housing plan for 
Soviet immigrants at a Cabinet meeting Sunday, but action was delayed because 
of opposition from Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon proposed buying 50,000 mobile homes and 40,000 prefabricated houses in 
the next two years, calling on the government to build another 60,000 units 
each year over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon's plan is mainly designed to accommodate Jewish immigrants from the 
Soviet Union. Some Israeli officials estimate that as many as 1 million Soviet 
newcomers could arrive within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Director General Aminkam Oren of the Housing Ministry said projections indicate 
that 200,000 families will be homeless in two years if a new building program 
is not begun quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Objections to Sharon's crash housing program were made by Finance Minister 
Modai, who argued that the government could not afford such a massive plan, 
estimated to cost $13.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Modai said after the meeting that a huge housing program would not leave any 
money "to create job opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
The finance minister and other officials have suggested that immigrants be put 
up in hotels, guest homes and hostels while awaiting permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon's plan has also run into opposition from the local housing industry, 
which objects to the use of prefabricated units, most of which would have to be 
imported. 
</P>
<P>
But senior Israeli officials are trying to figure out a way to head off 
conflict between the new Soviet arrivals and resident Israelis who have seen 
the cost of housing soar in recent months with immigration suddenly rising. 
</P>
<P>
Some Israelis have moved into tents, declaring they could no longer afford to 
pay the steep rentals for apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Small tent cities have sprung up around the country, and inhabitants plan a 
large demonstration in Jerusalem on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Cabinet sources said after Sunday's meeting that budgetary officials will 
present their own plan for new housing at the next Cabinet meeting on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight Arabs were being held Sunday as suspects in Saturday's bomb 
blast on a Tel Aviv beach that killed a 17-year-old Canadian girl and wounded 
18 others. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb was set off during the Sabbath afternoon and caused widespread panic. 
The explosion killed Marnie Kimmelman, of suburban Toronto, a member of a group 
of university students touring Israel in a trip sponsored by the Canadian 
Zionist Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Four Arab passersby were also injured when they were beaten up by enraged 
Israelis after the blast. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Tel Aviv Mayor Shlomo Lahat called the beatings of the Arabs "a 
disgrace, a shame." He said security officials are doing all they can to 
protect the beaches and streets against such random bomb attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian students said they will continue their tour of Israel as planned. 
</P>
<P>
In the occupied territories, Palestinians observed a general strike to mark the 
10th anniversary of Israel's formal annexation of East Jerusalem, wire services 
reported. Most activities were closed down, Palestinians said. 
</P>
<P>
The army closed the offices of Faisal Husseini, the leading Arab nationalist in 
the occupied territories and named by the army as one of the key figures of the 
Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The orders, valid for a year, said the action was being taken to protect public 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
A nationalist from a prominent family with roots in Jerusalem extending back 
centuries, Husseini this year has concentrated on seeking backing among liberal 
Israelis for Palestinian self-determination.

Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid said he will move up parliamentary

in February, 1987, is completely controlled by the National Liberation Front, 
which won only 28% of the popular vote in the June elections.

BUDGET WINNERS AND LOSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Max Boot, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the last month of fiscal debate, state programs big and small came under 
the budget knife. Some took heavy cuts, some took fatal wounds and some were in 
danger but ducked in time to survive intact. A few programs, such as prisons, 
will gain funds from the 10% spending increase this fiscal year. But Gov. 
George Deukmejian this week is expected to target at least $418 million in cuts 
in addition to the $2.3 billion already cut by the Legislature when it approved 
the $55-billion budget plan Saturday. As of now, the casualty and survival 
roster of key programs looks like this: 
</P>
<P>
SPARED 
</P>
<P>
* Education: After intense lobbying by state school officials, Deukmejian 
dropped a plan to reduce by $800 million the 42% of the budget that education 
is guaranteed by Proposition 98. As a result, spending on K-12 schools will 
grow by about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
* Media: Deukmejian also dropped a Senate plan to extend a 6% sales tax to 
newspapers, periodicals, advertising and movies that would have produced $54 
million in new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
* Sick and disabled: The governor first proposed, then rescinded, a cut of $5 
million from 28 Independent Living Centers that help the disabled live on their 
own. Deukmejian also switched and said he will not slash $4 million for 
Alzheimer's diagnostic treatment centers. 
</P>
<P>
* Prisons: Although the governor agreed to slash about 800 extra prison guard 
slots from the budget and delay the opening of two new prisons, the corrections 
budget will still grow by about 12% and the number of prison guards will 
increase by about 2,100. 
</P>
<P>
* Child-abuse training: Two programs dealing with child abuse have survived so 
far. Deukmejian has said he will leave intact the $10 million Child Abuse 
Prevention, Intervention Program, which deals with the effects of child abuse. 
But the governor has said he will slash a separate $10-million appropriation 
for the Child Abuse Prevention Training Program, which teaches children to 
guard against sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
HURT 
</P>
<P>
* Business: The state expects to raise $560 million by bringing the state tax 
code into conformity with changes in federal law dating from 1987. Business 
will feel the pinch because allowances and credits for business lunches, 
pension fund earnings and corporate dividends will be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
* Local government: Reduced by $600 million the level of state support for 
local functions such as operating trial courts and redevelopment agencies. 
</P>
<P>
* College students: The state expects to raise $31.1 million by increasing fees 
for resident students at Cal State and the University of California by 10% and 
by 9% for non-resident students. Merit pay for UC and Cal State employees will 
also be reduced, for a savings of $72.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Out-of-state vehicle owners: A $300 fee will be imposed on out-of-state 
vehicles registered for the first time in California, raising an expected $75 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* Welfare: The automatic cost-of-living adjustment for the poor, disabled and 
aged will be suspended this fiscal year for a savings of $259 million. A family 
of three receiving $726 per month will get the same level of aid instead of an 
expected $32-a-month increase. The cost-of-living adjustment will also be 
suspended for in-home care workers, saving the state about $3.1 million. And a 
$364 million program that provides education and job-training for welfare 
recipients will be slashed by $109.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Health: The state expects to save $209.5 million by decreasing health care 
funding, including funding for county health programs, the purchase of drugs 
and medical supplies under Medi-Cal, and long-term care. Another $45.6 million 
will be saved by suspending the cost-of-living adjustment for Medi-Cal 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
* Government operations: The state will save $31.9 million by cutting the 
operating budget of the Legislature, governor and other executive branch 
officials such as the controller and attorney general. An additional $200 
million will be saved by across-the-board reductions of 3%-15% in agency 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
* Park users: The state expects to raise $16 million by raising campground and 
day-use fees at state parks by 15%. 
</P>
<P>
* Renters: The renter's tax credit will be cut, from $137 to $120 a year for a 
couple. That will save $52 billion annually.

SKELETON UNEARTHED AT DEFUNCT HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A landscaper working in the courtyard of an abandoned mid-city hotel unearthed 
the skeletal remains of a person wrapped in a blanket, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The worker was turning over soil with a pick at 11:30 a.m. Saturday when he 
struck an orange blanket buried in a planter box of the building at 1250 S. 
Western Ave., said Officer Frank Ramirez of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Wilshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
"He tugged hard on the blanket and a skull popped out," Ramirez said. "It 
landed face-up on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
"He was very concerned about it," Ramirez added. "He ran to tell his boss, who 
notified police." 
</P>
<P>
Homicide investigators called to the scene found an entire skeleton, Ramirez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The skull had buck teeth and several other teeth missing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office was expected to determine the age and sex of the remains 
later in the week, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The building, which was abandoned 18 years ago, has been undergoing renovation 
for at least two years for use as an 90-unit apartment building, Ramirez said.

DECKING THE HULLS WITH HOLIDAY CHEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
They say that Christmas only comes once a year. 
</P>
<P>
But not in Oxnard's Mandalay Bay neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 dinghies festooned with garlands, lights and at least one Santa Claus 
cruised the canals of the 800-household marine neighborhood spreading some 
out-of-season holiday cheer Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas is so cold you can't enjoy it, so we said, 'Let's just get crazy in 
the summer,' " said Skip Harkson, who has organized the event for the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Harkson, dressed in red pants and a green shirt, said the celebration also 
serves as a block party and gives neighbors a chance to visit. 
</P>
<P>
The parade of decorated dinghies started from a dock near Oldham Circle about 7 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
June Bandy said she and her husband, Doc, love the summer Yuletide celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The couple rigged their dinghy with a white Christmas tree that twinkled with 
small lights powered by an on-board generator. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't just have Christmas in December," said Bandy, her eyes alight beneath 
her red felt cap. "We have it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Barton, dressed in a red nightshirt and stocking cap, said he has 
participated in the parade for three years because he just can't wait for 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Barton said Christmas and Halloween are his favorite holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should have two Halloweens a year," he said, as Christmas carols 
blared from a speaker on the dock. 
</P>
<P>
Barton, who said he came to the parade in drag last year, decorated his boat 
not only with holly and Christmas lights but with a giant, blowup beer bottle 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
But the event was not only for people on the decorated boats. 
</P>
<P>
Curious onlookers motored by in their boats. Some slowed to take photographs of 
the assorted characters. 
</P>
<P>
Harkson said about 25 people had called to find out about the best vantage 
point to watch the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Rene and George Aney of Sunland were camping in Ventura with their 
granddaughter Christine when they learned of the parade and headed over. 
</P>
<P>
"We were interested to see what they had to offer," Rene Aney said. 
</P>
<P>
After striking up a quick friendship with one boat owner, they hopped aboard 
and joined the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Elder of Oxnard said she had come to watch the parade in years past. 
</P>
<P>
"We love it," she said. "It's a real fun thing." 
</P>
<P>
Others were a tad more skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"It's different," said Rob Woodson, 24. "I'll say that." CAROL WATSON

PLAN'S DEMISE COULD ARREST DEVELOPMENT; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA CLARITA: PUBLIC OUTCRY OVER RAMPANT GROWTH FORCES THE CITY TO REJECT THE 
SANTA CATARINA CONDOS-FOR-ROADS PROPOSAL, AND THE DECISION MAY AFFECT POLITICS 
AND PLANNING IN THE AREA FOR YEARS TO COME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a debate that, in the words of Santa Clarita Mayor Jo Anne Darcy, has 
"literally torn this community apart." 
</P>
<P>
After five months of lengthy and often rancorous public meetings, the Santa 
Clarita City Council last week killed a controversial project in which a 
developer at one point agreed to provide $55 million in road improvements in 
exchange for being allowed to build 1,452 condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Although some City Council members originally hailed the plan as a way to solve 
traffic problems, they finally bowed to intense public pressure from homeowners 
who said the project was poorly planned and environmentally unsound. 
</P>
<P>
The political repercussions of the decision will reverberate for some time, 
setting the stage for new conflicts that may guide planning, growth and 
politics in the city for years to come, according to those involved in the 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
The fall of the Santa Catarina project could influence the fate of a 
growth-control initiative now in the works, the proposed recall of one 
councilman and the overall way developers conduct business in the Santa Clarita 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Santa Catarina acted as a political lightning rod, drawing 
together various forces in the city, all of which are tied to discontent with 
the rapid development of the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The various movements -- for a recall and for growth controls -- were 
symbolically united in the fight over Santa Catarina. "It all started to come 
together," said Kevin La Sota, a spokesman for homeowners opposing the project. 
</P>
<P>
As Councilwoman Jill Klajic sees it, the lesson of Santa Catarina is quite 
simple: "The lesson is, the community out here is sick and tired of 
development. The community wants to see some control, some restraint." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Catarina project took many forms over the months, but G. H. Palmer 
Associates initially proposed building 1,452 condominiums on 135 acres in 
Canyon Country, north of Soledad Canyon Road and southwest of Ermine Street. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Catarina was just one part of a complex deal that would have allowed the 
company to build two other housing projects in the city in exchange for 
millions of dollars in road improvements that Santa Clarita engineers said the 
city could not afford to build. But homeowner activists said the project was 
too large and unsuited for the site, and they charged that the Santa Clarita 
City Council was willing to let developers run roughshod over the city just to 
get some roads built. The activists also questioned the need for the roads, 
saying the new thoroughfares would encourage even more growth in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The activists even enlisted the aid of the state attorney general's office, 
which in May said the city should compel Palmer Associates to revise the 
environmental impact report for the project. The report, prepared by a 
consultant for Palmer Associates, "inadequately, inaccurately or altogether 
failed to address a number of significant issues," the attorney general's 
office said in a letter to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Council members tried to placate homeowners by saying that they would allow no 
more than 800 dwelling units on the site. But when the developer said he could 
not afford to scale back the project, the council said it would allow up to 
1,292. The council later changed its position again, saying the new cap was 
1,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Dan Palmer, trying to save the deal, said Tuesday night that he could 
build the project with only 800 units after all. But by then, council members 
said there was no way they could swiftly resolve the environmental concerns 
raised by the attorney general and homeowners. What's more, they said the deal 
had become too complex and unwieldy to handle. They voted it down 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council, after months and months and months of public hearings, 
finally decided to listen to the people," said John O'Dwyer, a homeowner who 
was a popular and colorful figure at Santa Catarina hearings, blasting the 
project with humorous speeches, poetry and even flash cards. O'Dwyer attended 
council hearings wearing a T-shirt that said: "Just Say No to Devious 
Planning." 
</P>
<P>
La Sota, who said he did not think that Santa Catarina would be defeated, said 
he was encouraged by the outcome because it proved that the City Council was 
willing to respond to the public. Three of the council members -- Darcy, Howard 
P. (Buck) McKeon and Carl Boyer III -- had tried for months to forge a 
compromise to save the roads-for-condos deal. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as you have the facts, you can fight City Hall," La Sota said. 
</P>
<P>
Marsha McLean, a civic activist who watches City Hall closely, agreed that the 
council's decision to scuttle Santa Catarina would enhance its reputation. "I 
think that's to their credit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But for Boyer, the lone council member to vote against killing off Santa 
Catarina, the repercussions could be far more serious. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Tuesday's vote on the project, Boyer was formally presented a 
notice by a citizens group calling for his recall. The notice said Boyer 
ignored the will of residents and promoted bad planning. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of Santa Catarina, meanwhile, has buoyed the hopes of a citizens 
group that hopes to place a growth-control measure before city voters, perhaps 
by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it just makes us even more convinced that we're going to win," said 
John Drew, spokesman for the group known as Citizens Assn. for a Responsible, 
Residential Initiative on Growth, or CARRING. 
</P>
<P>
The group was recently encouraged by a public opinion poll, commissioned by the 
city, that found that 60% of those surveyed would support a slow-growth 
initiative. The initiative is still being drafted, but Drew said it would 
probably place limits on the number of units that could be built each year and 
set forth the criteria that would be used when the council considers a 
development proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The activists who opposed the Santa Catarina project formed a grass-roots 
organization that wisely used the expertise of citizens who are lawyers, 
engineers or planners, Drew said. These professionals were able to pick apart 
the project's environmental impact report, a move that lead to the project's 
demise. CARRING is confident that it can duplicate that strategy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of Santa Catarina also puts developers on notice that they will 
have to win the support of homeowners if they expect to get their projects 
approved, Klajic said. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, homeowners will demand that developers build parks, donate money 
for schools or build roads as the price of their support. "This is a good 
message to the developers -- that they're going to have to give a lot more than 
they have been giving to develop here," McLean said. "And that's a good 
message." 
</P>
<P>
Developers are already unpopular in the Santa Clarita Valley, a city that 
incorporated in part because of the fear of overdevelopment. But the Santa 
Catarina debate lowered their stature even further. O'Dwyer, La Sota and other 
critics regularly charged that Palmer Associates treated homeowners with 
disrespect and disdain. Company officials said they were frank and responsive 
with residents. 
</P>
<P>
"They poisoned the well not only for themselves but for the rest of the 
development community," said Allan Cameron, a planning and political consultant 
for developers in the valley. Cameron said developers will have to work hard to 
overcome the stigma of Santa Catarina. 
</P>
<P>
Other developers, meanwhile, said Santa Catarina could scare off builders who 
otherwise might want to annex into the city of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few hours after the Santa Catarina proposal was killed, Gary Cusumano, 
chief operating officer of Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co., the valley's leading 
developer, told the City Council that he did not want to have company property 
west of the Golden State Freeway annexed into the city. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a considerable amount of unrest in this community," Cusumano told the 
council. The defeat of Santa Catarina, coupled with the initiative drive by 
CARRING, sets the stage for growth controls that could inhibit Newhall Land's 
future building plans, he said.

IN DESERT, WIND IS A DIRTY WORD; 
</P>
<P>
ANTELOPE VALLEY: DRY CONDITIONS, FEWER CROPS AND CONSTRUCTION HAVE KICKED UP 
CLOUDS OF DUST, ALONG WITH RESIDENTS' IRE.

Carolyn Kott and many of her neighbors on the east side of Palmdale feel like 
they're fighting a losing battle. The enemy is dirt, and they say they can't 
seem to keep it out of their homes, off their cars or from muddying their 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since developers several months ago stripped the vegetation from several 
large lots nearby, residents in the Antelope Valley neighborhood say they have 
had to live with clouds of dirt blown by the high desert's winds. Housecleaning 
has become virtually futile. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just gotten so disgusted," said Kott, standing with her husband on their 
dirt-covered back-yard patio. "It doesn't do any good. I'll clean this up, and 
it will be like this again in a few days. You just can't seem to keep ahead of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Although severe, the problems in Kott's Palmdale neighborhood are hardly 
unique. Few places or people in the high desert this year have escaped being 
blanketed by the onslaught of dirt and sand that residents say is the worst 
they have seen in decades. 
</P>
<P>
Blustery winds are nothing new to the high desert, but this year they have 
combined with a record fourth year of drought, a decline in the amount of 
acreage devoted to crops and the clearing of land for development to strip the 
soil from the valley. 
</P>
<P>
This past week, the South Coast Air Quality Management District conducted a 
public hearing about the desert's dust problems and decided to extend for 
another 18 months its monitoring of air quality in the area. AQMD officials 
said, however, that the amount of dust in the Antelope Valley's air does not 
exceed federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the 40 valley residents who attended the meeting disagreed with that 
sanguine assessment and said the experts' monitoring techniques have failed to 
detect the seriousness of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In developed parts of the valley, where other structures or landscaping offer 
some protection from the wind and dirt, residents still have been forced to 
cover their pools and cars, and weatherproof their houses. Contact lens wearers 
have suffered from irritated and watery eyes. 
</P>
<P>
In areas exposed to the open desert or near construction sites, the problems 
have been more severe, forcing people indoors and covering their houses, 
furniture and floors with a layer of fine-grained dust and sand. For some, it 
has caused health problems to worsen. And for almost everyone, it's meant a lot 
of cleaning up. 
</P>
<P>
"The dirt gets on the sidewalks and the entrance way, and all over the house," 
said George Greene, a retired Lancaster aerospace engineer who blames 
developers for the severity of the dust problems and officials in Lancaster and 
Palmdale for failing to respond. 
</P>
<P>
The worst conditions have arisen near the rapidly growing area's many 
construction sites, where the ground cover has been removed and loose dirt is 
piled next to excavations. Residents say their complaints, however, aren't 
bringing any action. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley's two largest cities, Lancaster and Palmdale, have 
ordinances requiring construction sites to be dampened with water to control 
dirt and dust. But residents say the cities are slow to respond to complaints, 
and watering is, at best, a temporary solution. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they and developers do what they can but admit it's 
difficult. "Out here, trying to keep dust down in heavy winds is impossible. 
It's a fact of life unless you stop all of the construction" or plant grass 
everywhere, said Roy Stilson, a Palmdale public works inspector. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some city and construction industry officials complain that another 
cause of the sandstorms has been animals that destroy vegetation by overgrazing 
vast areas of rangeland in the far west Antelope Valley. Occasionally powerful 
westerly winds then sweep up the dirt and deposit it miles away on city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The drought also has been a major factor, leaving the region bone-dry and 
choking off desert vegetation that might otherwise have kept the topsoil in 
place. As a result, large sections of the valley have become virtual sand 
dunes. 
</P>
<P>
The same phenomena also have occurred this year in other Southern California 
desert areas. Because of unusually strong winds and dry conditions, heaps of 
blowing sand have closed roads and frustrated residents in the Riverside County 
communities of Palm Desert, Cathedral City and Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Already this year in the Antelope Valley, at least half a dozen windstorms with 
gusts up to 60 m.p.h. have raised towering clouds of sand and dirt and reduced 
visibility in some places to near zero, causing dozens of traffic collisions. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions have also alarmed officials at Palmdale's commercial airport and 
the area's two military airports, Plant 42 in Palmdale and Edwards Air Force 
Base to the north. Officials there fear the blowing dirt could interfere with 
flight and testing activities. 
</P>
<P>
Large sandstorms have swept over the entire valley sporadically this year. But 
localized dust problems have occurred far more frequently near construction 
sites where even average-strength winds can pick up dirt exposed by 
excavations. Although smaller in scale, the dirt problems near construction 
sites can be intense, with mini-sand dunes piling up almost over night on front 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Wells said she knew nothing about such phenomena when she and her husband 
moved from the South Bay to buy their first home in Lancaster about 1 1/2 years 
ago. The young couple picked a house built across from a vacant lot and soon 
discovered open spaces aren't always an amenity. 
</P>
<P>
Dirt kicked up by a house builder on that property enveloped the neighborhood 
and forced the family to spend thousands of dollars to seal windows, replace 
carpeting and drapes and even repaint their new home's sandblasted exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Wellses and 10 other families were each awarded $1,850 in what 
Lancaster officials said was the first criminal case in the region in which a 
developer had been ordered to pay homeowners for damages caused by blowing 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Harold Smith of the Costa Mesa-based Rialto Development Co. pleaded no 
contest to one misdemeanor count under the city's ordinance and was ordered to 
begin paying each of the families in $100-a-month installments. But Wells said 
the families have yet to receive any of the money. 
</P>
<P>
In Kott's neighborhood in Palmdale, meanwhile, some residents are talking about 
gathering signatures on a petition spelling out their complaints that they 
would then present to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Kott said the blowing dirt and sand have worsened her husband's emphysema. 
Nearby resident Sylvia Williams said her family soon is going to have their 
pool redone for the second time in two years because sand has damaged the 
surface. Their plants seem to be suffering from the dirt as well. 
</P>
<P>
And neighbor Mary Massarella, a 26-year resident of the area, said she's almost 
given up on cleaning her house, which is downwind of several construction 
sites. "It's gotten to the point where I'm tired of fighting it," she said. "I 
don't even walk barefoot in the house anymore."

Battles raged around a radio station in Monrovia's suburbs while rebel fighters 
attacked government army positions in the Liberian capital. 
</P>
<P>
Automatic machine-gun fire clattered for several hours around the government 
radio station about six miles from central Monrovia. The radio station has not 
broadcast for several weeks, although government troops were reported still 
holding out there. In Monrovia, two rival groups of rebels were pushing toward 
the heavily defended seafront mansion of President Samuel K. Doe, who has vowed 
to fight to the finish.

<P>
A 50,000-gallon, five-mile-long slick of oil from two damaged barges in 
Galveston Bay was moving away from shore as cleanup crews worked to deflect it 
from environmentally sensitive waterfowl habitats, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Other vessels were backed up in the Houston Ship Channel, closed since the 
barges collided Saturday with the Liberian tanker Shinoussa. One barge was 
sinking and the other was listing; oil from the nearly sunken barge escaped to 
the surface, while leakage from the other was mostly trapped in absorbent pads. 
A second, smaller slick also developed about a mile from shore, near the site 
of the accident, Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene said.

Looting broke out for a second night on Chicago's West Side, where stores were 
ransacked following a power outage Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they arrested 49 people on looting-related charges Saturday after a 
generating plant fire knocked out power to 40,000 customers. About 15 stores 
were ransacked. There were sporadic reports of looting Sunday, but no arrests 
were made, police said. "We've got enough troops now. We've got them on the 
run," said police Sgt. John McDonald, adding that the number of police on 
streets in the affected area had been increased to 300 from 100 on Saturday 
night. Power was restored to about 20,000 customers by 4 p.m. Sunday.

Cool, moist air tended to restrain the growth of wildfires in central Alaska, 
officials said, but in eastern Alaska more than 1,000 firefighters continued to 
battle an 87,800-acre blaze. The total amount of land burned was expected to 
hit 2.2 million acres today, an area equivalent to three times the size of 
Rhode Island. Officials at the Interagency Fire Coordination Center said 119 
fires were still active.

Right-Wing Tabloid Says It Speaks for 'Silent Majority' 
</P>
<P>
And now a new voice crying in the wilderness of San Diego politics. 
</P>
<P>
The Leader: The Voice of America's Finest City, a twice-monthly tabloid with a 
conservative slant, just put out its fourth edition, complete with Old Glory on 
the front page and poll results on which City Council member is most likely to 
be recalled (Bob Filner). 
</P>
<P>
The publisher is Americana Affiliated, whose principal is Robert Tharp, son of 
retired Superior Court Judge and Republican Party stalwart Ross Tharp. The 
judge is also an investor. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to provide things not found in other papers. 
</P>
<P>
Like a scalding review of the redistricting flap ("Can We Trust The Gang of 
Five?"), reprints from American Rifleman about gun-bearing folks defending 
themselves, and a contrarian look at Nelson Mandela ("Mandela Madness"). 
</P>
<P>
Retired judge Ed Butler, in a commentary, says the redistricting map rivals the 
contortion that gives rise to the term gerrymandering: 
</P>
<P>
"In San Diego, what do we call it? A Hartleymander? A Filnermander? A 
Councilmander? We now have here in San Diego an exercise in raw politics." 
</P>
<P>
Judging from its stories, The Leader is pro-NRA, pro-MADD, anti-abortion, 
anti-drug, anti-flag burning, anti-tax increases, and pro-growth. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-thousand copies are spread freely around locations in Point Loma, 
Hillcrest, Mission Hills, Pacific Beach, Clairemont and downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Managing editor Viki Barefoot says the paper figures to be in the red for at 
least a year. Advertising is picking up. 
</P>
<P>
Who will follow the Leader? 
</P>
<P>
"The middle-class, silent majority that is always getting shafted and has no 
way to yell back," says Phil Acker, former city clerk and a Leader volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
A mayoral preference poll of Leader readers found 20% for Roger Hedgecock, 16% 
for Councilman Ron Roberts, 10% for newspaper editor Neil Morgan, and 4% for 
anchorman Mike Tuck. 
</P>
<P>

Wackenhut Inc., the Florida firm that the San Diego City Council may hire to 
run the state's first private jail, is no stranger to San Diego.

When the Union-Tribune Publishing Co. brought in the Tennessee law firm King 
&amp; Ballow to handle its contract negotiations, K&amp;B fired all the U-T 
security guards and hired spiffy new guards from Wackenhut. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing on Wackenhut is standard procedure when K&amp;B enters a newspaper

NAVY TO ROLL OUT THE RED CARPET AS SOVIET WARSHIPS VISIT SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Navy will welcome three Soviet navy ships when they arrive Tuesday 
morning at the 32nd Street Naval Station, where a traditional Soviet ceremony 
will kick off a 5-day visit to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The visit -- the first time Soviet military vessels have docked on the West 
Coast -- is the latest in a series of reciprocal exchanges that brought another 
Soviet navy contingent to Norfolk, Va., last July. 
</P>
<P>
The visit -- intended to foster goodwill -- will "improve dialogue, 
understanding and confidence" between the United States and the Soviet Union, 
said Vice Adm. John Fetterman, commander of the Pacific Fleet's naval air 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the pageant-laden week will include a visit to the U.S. Grant 
Hotel Tuesday night, where the Soviet Song and Dance troupe will perform; trips 
to Sea World and the San Diego Zoo; a flight demonstration at Miramar Naval Air 
Station; and a rodeo at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The most somber event occurs Wednesday afternoon, when the Soviet contingent, 
led by Pacific Fleet commander Adm. Gennadij Alkesandrovich Khvatov, will lay a 
wreathe at the Rosecrans National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
A very lucky and relatively small number of San Diegans, judging from the 
demand for free tour tickets, will be allowed to board one of the two visiting 
destroyers, the Admiral Vinogradov or Boyevoy, that will be docked at the naval 
station's Pier 2. An oiler, the Argun, will also be docked there. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pritchard, a Navy spokesman, the 8,000 tour tickets 
were given away in 1 1/2 hours Tuesday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy, which had set up a temporary booth in a Marine Corps recruiting 
vehicle, said they had to turn many people away. Some had waited in line from 6 
a.m. to 11 a.m. for a chance to secure tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"They went as fast as we could hand them out," Pritchard said. 
</P>
<P>
Tours are from 12:30 p.m to 5:30 p.m. Tuesday and from noon to 5 p.m. Wednesday 
through Friday. Visitors are allowed to bring cameras aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard recommended that people taking the tours travel by trolley to the 
Pacific Fleet stop, but he said parking will be available at 32nd and Main 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the tours, the best chance to see the Soviets will be during their 
visits to Sea World and the San Diego Zoo Wednesday and Thursday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Song and Dance troupe that will entertain at the invitation-only 
Tuesday night reception will perform at several locations throughout the week, 
with all shows free and open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday afternoon, they will be at Sea World's City Streets from 12:15 to 
1:15; Thursday they will perform at the Balboa Park's Spreckels Organ Pavilion 
from noon to 1 p.m. and later at San Diego State University's Open Air Theatre 
from 6:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, they will be back at the Spreckels Organ Pavilion from noon to 1 p.m. 
and at Tidelands Park in Coronado from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 300 of the 800 Soviet sailors making the trip will leave the pier 
during any single excursion. 
</P>
<P>
Those staying behind will mingle with U.S. sailors from the guided-missile 
frigate McClusky, the guided-missle cruiser Leahy and the destroyer Merrill, 
which are the host ships. 
</P>
<P>
Adm. Charles Larson, commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet, is the visit's 
official host. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, it's mainly "a social call," said Benjamin Lambeth, a Soviet 
expert with the Rand Corp., a think-tank which does work for the military. 
</P>
<P>
But these visits are significant, he said, because while civilian exchanges 
occur, the military-to-military meetings allow both sides to penetrate the 
hyperbole and stereotypes that dominate attitudes about the more secretive 
military segments of each society. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get to see them first-hand. It has the effect of breaking down the 
stereotypes people have," said Lambeth, director of the international security 
and defense policy program at Rand. 
</P>
<P>
Lambeth likens the visit to one he made to the Soviet Union, where he flew in 
the Mig-29 fighter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real three-dimensional, hands-on perspective. It makes you gain 
respect for your Soviet (counterparts)," he said. "(Meeting them) is certainly 
better than reading about them." 
</P>
<P>
The groundwork for the visit was laid in 1988 by Adm. William Crowe, former 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and by former Soviet chief of staff 
Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, who is now national security adviser to Soviet 
President Mikail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Soviet visit to Norfolk, Va., U.S. ships visited the Black 
Sea port of Sevastopol last August, and in September, U.S. Pacific Fleet ships 
will visit Vladivostok, the Soviet Union's chief Pacific port. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pritchard, off-base security for the visitors will not be unusual. 
He said the Soviets' escorts will also double as their security. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I can characterize the off-base activities as the Soviets being 
teamed up with their host ship sailors and a cadre of interpreters." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, he said, the San Diego Police Department and the security 
personnel at each event will play large roles. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard said the Navy office responsible for coordinating the press alone has 
been staffed with 40 people who were expecting about 200 journalists from 
across the country to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been meeting since (since June) . . . on a regular basis to get ready 
for this," he said. He estimated "several hundred" Navy personnel had been 
directly involved in the planning and execution of the visit. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials are aware that several groups -- ranging in diversity from the 
John Birch Society to Greenpeace -- are considering plans to demonstrate during 
the visit. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a free and democratic society and that's their right," said 
Pritchard. 
</P>
<P>
"Should they decide to express those rights we hope they will do so in a manner 
consistent with the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One San Diegan anticipating the Soviet arrival is Lowell Strombeck, president 
of Citizen Diplomacy of San Diego, who visited Vladivostok last month with a 
group of local artists. 
</P>
<P>
There they received an unusual invitation. 
</P>
<P>
The officers of the Boyevoy, who had heard the San Diegans were in the city, 
called on them to come aboard the ship. There, said Strombeck, they were 
quizzed about San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked us a lot of questions about San Diego," he said. "They were really 
quite excited about their trip." 
</P>

Among other things, he said, the officers were curious about Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor and about what kind of clothes they would need to take.

Strombeck said he sensed the visit to San Diego could be particularly timely 
for the Soviet officers, from whom he got the impression were having to adjust 
to interacting with a freely elected civilian government in their home port.

"I think they'll be asking the Navy all kinds of questions about what it's like 
to relate to a government that's freely elected," he said.

"It's a whole new ballgame for them now."

SUMMER STUDENTS SPARK TO 'JUMP-START' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After years of desultory and limited remedial offerings that failed to turn on 
students and teachers, new excitement is stirring in summer schools across San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 sixth- and seventh-graders in Donna Somerville's enrichment class at 
Memorial Junior High School have talked with a space-station designer, went 
behind the scenes at the zoo, used microscopes to explore the structure of 
cells, and written dialogue for a play on Macintosh computers. 
</P>
<P>
Somerville's students are among 350 scattered throughout nine elementary and 
secondary schools in Southeast San Diego who are participating in a new magnet 
enrichment program. The program is made possible through a federal, multi-year 
grant awarded to the city school district. 
</P>
<P>
The 33 or so first-graders assigned to Lois Jacobs' class at Field Elementary 
in Clairemont for extra reading help don't know that they're part of a new 
district effort to try to make remediation -- long the staple of summer school 
instruction -- pay off better when the students return to classes this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs and her aide, Kathy Tronerud, both from Fremont Elementary, are using 
new literature books, "magic circle" groupings of children working with other 
children, storyboard drawings and a host of other new curriculum offerings to 
"jump-start" the academic performance of these students, all of whom have been 
judged to be at risk of falling behind their peers even at their early age. 
</P>
<P>
No longer are the several thousand elementary students who need more work in 
basic skills being asked to use the same textbooks and teaching style that 
proved lacking in getting them adequately prepared the first time. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the innovations in the skills classes are happening largely at the 
elementary level. 
</P>
<P>
Junior- and senior-high students needing to repeat a course to make up a 
failing grade still receive the same material during a concentrated four-hour, 
six-week period that leaves creativity and changes in teaching styles up to the 
individual teacher. 
</P>
<P>
District educators believe that the changes already made -- as well as others 
anticipated in the future -- can only improve long-term academics. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Stevens, who oversees the regular summer school program for the San Diego 
Unified School District, says that making summer school "fun" will increase 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
The element of fun is central to the enrichment classes, which are being 
offered for the first time in almost a decade. Until this summer, parents 
interested in having their children receive such instruction had only the 
private Gateways program in University City as an option. 
</P>
<P>
Program coordinator Carolanne Buguey said there are 350 students, about the 
maximum allowed under the funding, about equally divided between elementary and 
secondary levels. Any student at a magnet city school -- a school with special 
curriculum designed to promote integration by attracting students from outside 
the immediate neighborhood -- was eligible to apply. Most of the secondary 
students who are participating signed up for a course to prepare for college 
entrance examinations. 
</P>
<P>
At Oak Park Elementary, teacher Peggy Araiza has organized her six-week program 
around an "animal kingdom" theme, drawing in elements of science, literature, 
writing and fine arts as a way to expose her 20 students to new ideas and 
experiences, as well as strengthening their writing, reading and math skills. 
</P>
<P>
Her aide, Monica Pernell, a Serra High School senior who is part of a 
future-teachers program, said that the enrichment class is "a real eye opener. 
These kids have so much going on that they don't have time to sit around and 
talk." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, each day the students launch enthusiastically into a 10-minute chorus 
of poems and songs, ranging from "Little Orphan Annie" by James Whitcomb Riley, 
to the Gettysburg Address of Abraham Lincoln, and the "I Have a Dream" speech 
of Martin Luther King Jr., as soon as they finish the morning Pledge of 
Allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
"All the students have varied interests and you have to stay on top of each 
individual child" to get the maximum result, Araiza said. "For some, you have 
to prepare them for enrichment, dangle a lot of carrots in front of them, like 
the chance to do calligraphy, to pick out a special book, and by doing so, 
boost their attitudes so that they'll then sit down with their times 
(multiplication) tables and work on that as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important (at this age) because many are getting ready for middle 
school . . . I want to have as much impact on their lives as possible, to give 
them as many tools for leaning as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Memorial's Somerville had her students preparing reports on animals last week 
in anticipation of their visit to the zoo. Each read their report orally in 
front of a video camera as preparation for performing a play in front of an 
audience later in the course. 
</P>
<P>
"I want them to bond, to have better self-esteem, to have positive peer 
pressure for achievement, to make this summer count so that it will make a 
difference in their lives," said Somerville, a resource teacher during the 
regular year at Memorial, an oasis of learning in the midst of one of the 
toughest barrios in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Somerville worries that some of the students could eventually succumb to the 
barrio pressure to not do well in school, especially as they move into the 
secondary years. 
</P>
<P>
But for the moment, she is exhilarated about the summer class. 
</P>
<P>
In general, while the enrichment classes have no more than 20 students, the 
regular summer classes can range from 25 students to almost 40, making the 
"jump start" effort of teachers even more difficult because it limits the 
personal attention they can give students. 
</P>
<P>
But Stevens hopes that the new literature-based curriculum written especially 
for summer-school use and which emphasizes hands-on learning, will address more 
of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought that if we did something different to promote fun, not fun and 
games, but excitement about learning, we might short-circuit some of the 
failure syndrome that these kids otherwise get into," said Pat Meredith, a 
resource teacher who helped write some of the summer-school literature lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy. We realize that there are skills these children need and they 
haven't learned them well enough the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs would readily agree. 
</P>
<P>
Considered one of the district's stellar teachers, Jacobs sometimes feels she 
has moved mountains at the end of the four-hour summer instructional day. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students still struggle to read basic sentences, and their previous 
lack of success leads quickly into short attention spans and horseplay as 
Jacobs cajoles them to think about "Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile," the book they are 
reading together. 
</P>
<P>
She has the students talk together about crocodiles, to write a word or two 
about their own feelings toward the animal, to play around with paper strips of 
sentences to try to arrange them in the order of a story. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad because for some of these kids, learning has no meaning and school is 
anything but fun," said Tronerud, Jacobs' aide. "Some of these kids already 
feel they are failures, but they don't have to be." 
</P>
<P>
To help turn around their attitudes, Jacobs cooks for the students each Friday, 
showing them how to use their arithmetic to measure weights and liquids in 
making brownies or fruit cocktails or homemade ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that they are picking up some vocabulary," Jacobs said. "The new 
(literature) curriculum has made a difference" compared to controlled-word 
reading texts traditionally used in the district. 
</P>
<P>
The new curriculum, which emphasizes writing and literature discussions 
especially at the upper elementary grades, has made Sheila Barron's task much 
easier with her fourth- and fifth-graders at Lee Elementary in Paradise Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a big library, we have bought a lot of new books, we are working to 
get kids to see reading not as a task but as a joy," Barron said. To that end, 
she constantly throws out ideas and observations to the students, asking them 
to think about how they might change the plot, encouraging them to write a 
letter to one of the story's characters, to speculate on where the next 
chapters of the novel might take the plot. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the student seem to be more interested" than they are in the 
traditional textbooks, Barron said. "There actually does seem to be a lot of 
thinking and listening going on."

CARE PROGRAM AIDS CHILD ABUSE FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: TEAMS EDUCATE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS ABOUT WARNING SIGNALS. BUT ITS 
FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN BECAUSE OF STATE BUDGET CRUNCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
These days, Louise Gagne is sometimes haunted by the face of a little girl who 
was in her class at a well-regarded private school a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize now she was severely sexually abused, but I just couldn't recognize 
it at the time," said Gagne. Now a teacher at Micheltorena Street Elementary 
School in Silver Lake, she is part of the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
highly praised anti-child-abuse program. 
</P>
<P>
As a participant in CARE (Child Abuse: Recognize and Eliminate), Gagne is part 
of a team at the school that has been specially trained to recognize the often 
elusive signals of neglect and of sexual, physical and emotional abuse. She and 
her peers are well-grounded in when, what and how to report suspected 
incidents. The team works with staff members and parents to help head off or 
defuse problems at earlier than usual stages. Perhaps most important, they 
teach children how to protect themselves, including ways to fight the 
life-scarring psychological effects of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most comprehensive, thoughtful and efficient school-based program 
anywhere," said Dr. Michael Durfee, coordinator of child abuse prevention 
programs for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Durfee was among those who helped persuade Board of Education members in June 
to leave the CARE program untouched when it needed to cut $220 million from the 
district's budget. 
</P>
<P>
However, the program faces a much bigger problem. Nearly 75% of its annual 
$800,000 funding comes from a $10.1 million state program Gov. George 
Deukmejian has said he wants to eliminate to help solve California's own budget 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unconscionable for the governor even to propose such a thing," Board 
President Jackie Goldberg said Friday. She said it would be very difficult for 
the district, which is likely to face even more cuts as a result of events in 
Sacramento, to find the money to save the CARE program. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly would want to," Goldberg added, "but I don't know how we could." 
</P>
<P>
The funds were intact in the budget approved by legislators on Saturday, but it 
was uncertain whether they would survive the governor's expected veto of 
specific budget items this week. 
</P>
<P>
Developed by former teacher Shayla Lever, now director of the district's Child 
Abuse Prevention Unit, the CARE program began in 1980 and has grown to include 
152 of the district's 414 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Lever's office provides intensive training for a small, handpicked team of 
staff members at each participating school, along with some basic education in 
program principles for other staff members, curriculum materials, student 
instruction and parent workshops. The program is designed so each school, once 
training is completed, can operate nearly autonomously, freeing the 10-member 
office to monitor program effectiveness, provide teaching for new staff members 
and other support services, and concentrate on bringing more schools into the 
fold. 
</P>
<P>
"We have managed so far to provide the training to every school that has asked 
to be included and still maintain a high level of service," said Lever, whose 
project has drawn the interest of several other school districts in California. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that victims of child abuse often grow up to be deeply troubled, 
sometimes antisocial adults, who in turn abuse their own children, Lever argued 
that cutting prevention program funds is a false economy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more tangible measures of the program lies in the statistics 
tabulated annually on reports of suspected child-abuse cases from all of the 
district's more than 600 schools. CARE schools, on average, submit about six 
times the number of suspected cases as non-CARE schools. About 6% of those 
reports are deemed unfounded by the agencies who receive them, while that 
proportion ranges anywhere from 40% to 70% for the other schools. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires principals, teachers and others to immediately report 
suspected cases to a child protective agency: in Los Angeles, the county 
Department of Children's Services or the local police department. Those who do 
not risk facing criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Child abuse is sometimes so hard to recognize that, despite the district's 
widely disseminated instructions, many cases that should be reported are not, 
while some incidents are submitted that turn out to be without merit, Lever 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers of reports filed -- an average of 14 per school last year -- 
remains fairly constant for CARE schools. From July, 1989, through June, 1990, 
those schools accounted for 2,129 of the 6,168 cases reported districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
"An issue overall is simply one of correct information," said Lt. Steve Day, 
former head of the Los Angeles Police Department's child protection section. 
"We can generally tell if the reporter is a graduate of the CARE program." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the state reporting law, Day added, "teachers and others tend to err 
on the side of reporting. The potential to clog the system (with unwarranted 
reports) is there." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled the months after teacher Terry Bartholome's arrest in 1984, and 
eventual conviction, for molesting students in his elementary school classes. 
"You had institutional paranoia then," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1985-86 school year, the number of reports from the district zoomed to 
7,011. Nearly 5,500 of those came from non-CARE schools and most were 
determined to have been without basis. 
</P>
<P>
"The fallout from that was really, really detrimental," said Lever, not only 
because innocent people were accused but also because, in the resulting loss of 
credibility, "abused children went by the wayside." 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist and child-abuse expert Dr. Roland Summit of Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center said the CARE program has many other benefits, including an emphasis on 
teaching children that they are not to blame and are not unworthy if they are 
unable to fend off the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Another benefit comes from the heightened awareness and skill of CARE school 
staff members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It provides more avenues of support, and it gives teachers a way to get more 
comfortable (in dealing with child abuse) on an ongoing basis. That's much more 
effective than bringing in a consultant for a few hours of training and then 
moving on." 
</P>
<P>
In 10 years, only three schools have dropped out of the program. Despite the 
track record, the principals at most of the district's elementary schools have 
not joined. They include those at the two schools Bartholome taught, and the 
one at which another former teacher, Don Ray Moore, has been accused of 
sexually abusing fifth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
Lever said the reasons range from an unwillingness to make the required 
substantial commitment in time and staff, to a lingering unfamiliarity with the 
program, to a reluctance to acknowledge child abuse as a widespread problem. 
(Experts estimate that, nationwide, at least one in five youngsters suffers 
some form of abuse.) 
</P>
<P>
At Micheltorena, Principal Eugene Sabin is so enthusiastic about the program 
that he has included himself in the five-member project team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have learned a lot about the needs of our students. I've been 
surprised at the extent and depth of some of the problems," said Sabin, who 
said his main criteria in assembling the team was to pick dedicated, energetic 
teachers who had the respect of their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Stephanie Buehler, a member of the CARE team since the program started 
at Micheltorena two years ago, said she believes the whole staff, including 
bilingual classroom aides and clerical workers, works in a coordinated way to 
help children and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a strategy, and everyone knows what it is," Buehler said, reciting the 
principles the program aims at young abuse victims: Say no; get away if you 
can; tell someone; it's not your fault; it will not always be like this; and 
there are people who care and can help. 
</P>
<P>
"The child knows there is a whole support network here, and many times we are 
able to help parents before a situation reaches the point of abuse," agreed 
teacher Donna Kusumoto. 
</P>
<P>
She cited the case of a kindergartner who began crying as the teacher passed 
out projects the youngsters had crafted for Mother's Day gifts. After some 
gentle questioning, the child said her mother had threatened to throw the 
offering in the trash. During a hastily arranged, informal talk, the frazzled 
young working mother confided she felt under a lot of pressure and had once 
told her daughter, "I wish you'd run away." 
</P>
<P>
Kusumoto said the CARE team lined up some counseling and other help for the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, what happens after an incident is reported becomes as crucial as 
stopping the abuse in the first place, team members said. They related a recent 
case of an 11-year-old girl who said she was being molested by an uncle living 
at her home. The report was investigated and the uncle was ordered by 
authorities to leave the house. 
</P>
<P>
Then the child suffered the anger of her parents, who had counted on the uncle 
to help them pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard at home. They're blaming me," the girl often tells her 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working a lot with her, trying to build up her self-esteem, assure her 
that she did the right thing," Kusumoto said. "We want her to know that she is 
more important than the rent, no matter what she is being told at home."

An inherited human disorder that causes retardation and skeletal abnormalities 
has been cured in mice by the injection of a human gene, a researcher said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The technique cannot now be used in humans, but the experiment demonstrates 
that gene replacement is feasible for treating an important group of human 
disorders, said Edward Birkenmeier of the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Me. 
</P>
<P>
"It works remarkably well," Birkenmeier said. "You can completely cure the 
mice." 
</P>
<P>
The mice carried a genetic mutation like that seen in the human disorder called 
mucopolysaccharidosis type 7, or MPS-7, which occurs in about one in 25,000 
births. The seven forms of MPS are characterized by genetic defects that leave 
the body without an enzyme needed to break down and dispose of waste products. 
</P>
<P>
Birkenmeier has eliminated the symptoms of MPS-7 in afflicted mice in two ways. 
In the first, he injected the human gene into fertilized mouse eggs, which were 
then grown into healthy mice. In the second, he removed bone marrow cells from 
afflicted mice, inserted the gene into the cells, and put the cells back into 
bone marrow, where they replicated and produced the missing enzyme.

CYSTIC FIBROSIS CLUES SURFACE 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A newly discovered cluster of genetic flaws responsible for a small fraction of 
cystic fibrosis cases may provide valuable clues to finding a treatment for the 
nation's most common inherited fatal disease, a U.S.-Canadian research team 
reported last week in the British journal Nature. The four genetic defects 
together account for about 7% of cystic fibrosis cases in whites and 5% in 
American blacks. 
</P>
<P>
The new research suggests that the genetic mutations lie in a region of the 
gene that appears to be the blueprint for a protein that binds to a chemical 
fuel called adenosine triphosphate or ATP, said Dr. Gary Cutting of Johns 
Hopkins School of Medicine, who collaborated with researchers at Toronto's 
Hospital for Sick Children. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers previously speculated that the cystic fibrosis gene is the 
blueprint for a protein that may act as a pump to carry chloride out of cells. 
Chloride is important for regulating cells' water balance, and upsetting that 
balance may be what causes mucus in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients to 
thicken, impairing breathing. 
</P>
<P>
ATP is not directly involved in the transport of chloride in and out of cells, 
which prompts researchers to speculate that the cystic fibrosis protein may 
pump something other than chloride. Exactly what that substance is remains a 
mystery, but researchers said it could have an indirect effect on movement of 
chloride in the body.

ALZHEIMER'S LINK DISCOVERED

<TEXT>
<P>
The discovery of a genetic defect linked to Alzheimer's disease could someday 
lead to a treatment, a researcher reported last week. In a presentation at the 
Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Me., Allen Roses of Duke University said his 
study of 32 families with a history of Alzheimer's revealed a common defect on 
chromosome 19, one of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes. 
</P>
<P>
The progressive neurological disorder afflicts about 4 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The finding surprised most researchers studying the disease's genetics because 
it had previously been thought to be linked to an abnormality on chromosome 21. 
That defect is associated with a rare, early-onset form of Alzheimer's in which 
memory loss and other symptoms begin to appear around age 40. 
</P>
<P>
Roses speculated that the early-onset form of Alzheimer's is a different 
disease. He used his genetic samples to search for a defect on chromosome 21 in 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease and could not find it.

Certain people appear to be genetically susceptible to developing chronic 
arthritis from Lyme disease that does not respond to treatment, researchers 
reported last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
A high proportion of people who develop long-term Lyme disease-induced 
arthritis have proteins known as antigens in their blood that act as genetic 
markers indicating a high susceptibility to arthritis, said Dr. Allen Steere, 
director of the Lyme Disease Clinic at the New England Medical Center in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
In a study of 80 people with Lyme disease arthritis, Steere and his colleagues 
found that 25 of 28 patients, or 89%, whose arthritis had lasted between one 
and four years had one or both of the genetic markers known as HLA-DR4 and 
HLA-DR2. By contrast, only six of 22 people, or 27%, with arthritis lasting 
between one to five months had the markers.

CHANCE TO START ISN'T WASTED BY SCHROEDER

Bill Schroeder doesn't lament his limited playing time, not after a sore elbow 
kept him on the disabled list until July 2 and nearly convinced him his time 
was up as a major league catcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel frustrated at all," Schroeder said Sunday after hitting two home 
runs and guiding Jim Abbott through seven strong innings in the Angels' 6-2 
victory over Seattle at the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to be in the position I am," Schroeder said. "A month and a half 
ago, I never thought I'd be in this position. I don't feel frustrated -- I feel 
pretty lucky." 
</P>
<P>
For Schroeder, the satisfaction of playing so impressively ran deep. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point of my career, that's my role (catching behind Lance Parrish) and 
I'm happy with it," said Schroeder, who hit a fastball off Seattle starter Matt 
Young (5-11) that barely cleared the right field fence in the fourth inning to 
give the Angels a 3-1 lead, and who provided the fifth run with a drive off 
Gene Harris in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"Six weeks ago, two months ago I didn't think I'd be able to even do this. I'm 
tickled to death to be able to go out there." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott (7-9) was glad to have Schroeder as his mentor. Led by Schroeder to use 
his slider and curveball more than he might have been inclined to on his own, 
Abbott was in command throughout and showed poise in escaping a bases-loaded 
jam in the first inning and a second-and-third, one-out situation in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Bill had a great game. He called a great game, and the fact that he 
got two home runs was a bonus," said Abbott, who walked four and struck out 
three. "He's a solid catcher, and I'm real comfortable working with him. We 
probably hadn't worked together in a long time, but he was really solid." 
</P>
<P>
He was better than that, according to Manager Doug Rader. "The work he did 
behind the plate was extremely good," Rader said. "Abbie used all his pitches, 
and Bill blocked the ball well. I don't take him for granted. A guy may have 
done the job 1,000 times, but when he does it the 1,001st, you've got to 
remember to be grateful for it." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott got single runs in the first, third and fourth innings. 
</P>
<P>
In the first, Brian Downing and Donnie Hill walked and Downing scored when 
first baseman Pete O'Brien couldn't handle Dave Winfield's shot. 
</P>
<P>
Hill scored from second base in the third inning when Harold Reynolds misplayed 
a double-play ball hit by Winfield, throwing wildly to first. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they've been struggling scoring runs," Young said. "Pete O'Brien makes 
that play 99 out of 100 times. The ball just took a funny hop. And in the 
third, Winfield hit a routine double-play ball that could easily have gotten us 
out of the inning. These things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's home run in the fourth barely cleared the fence, to Schroeder's 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw it because of the lights," said Schroeder, whose only other home 
run this season was in the Angels' 20-7 humiliation July 8 at Milwaukee. "I was 
jogging to first. It's a good thing it went out, because I would have been 
standing on first. The second one was the only one I knew was out as soon as I 
hit it." 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette preceded Schroeder with a home run to left field, his 13th of 
the season, and the Angels added another run in the ninth inning on a walk to 
Downing, a double by Hill, an intentional walk to White and Winfield's 
fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way we used to play the game . . . ," before the proliferation of 
those rotisserie leagues," Downing said of the Angels' opportunistic innings. 
"It kind of gets lost in the shuffle. If you make a pitcher throw enough 
pitches to you over and over, it can make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott was sharp and confident. He had yielded a run in the third inning on a 
walk, Jeffrey Leonard's single and Alvin Davis' sacrifice fly, but the game 
hinged on Abbott's mastery in the sixth inning. With Davis on third base and 
Edgar Martinez on second, Abbott threw six consecutive sliders to strike out 
David Valle and get Omar Vizquel to fly to center and preserve a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more worried about Vizquel hitting something over somebody's head," 
Schroeder said. "I had talked to Lance a lot about what he had been doing (with 
Abbott's repertoire), and he said they'd been going with curveballs and 
changeups and that's basically what we were doing. He was throwing the ball 
hard and he had a real good slider and we used six sliders for two outs." 
</P>
<P>
While Schroeder was sidelined because of the surgery he underwent last 
September, he never counted himself out. "I'm healthy and my arm feels good, 
better than all of last year," he said. "I want to get the opportunity at some 
point to catch a few days in a row and prove I can do it. . . . I'm not saying 
my arm feels 100%, but I'm able to do what I have to do every day." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Harvey relieved Jim Abbott in the eighth inning after a single by Jeffrey 
Leonard and a double by Alvin Davis and gave up a sacrifice fly to Scott 
Bradley that scored the Mariners' final run. Harvey allowed one hit over two 
innings to earn his 12th save, one behind club leader Mark Eichhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Bert Blyleven, who shaved his beard after losing at Oakland last 
Wednesday, is growing it back because of popular demand. His teammates' demand, 
that is. "They said, 'Cover that face!' " Blyleven said. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Dave Winfield, a native of St. Paul, Minn., will participate in the 
groundbreaking of a $5.5 million indoor softball facility in the Twin Cities 
suburb of Lino Lakes Tuesday. Winfield is a consultant and adviser to the group 
funding the venture, Inside Sports, Inc. Winfield, who still has a home in the 
Twin Cities, today will play host to a lunch for his Angel teammates and 
several of his relatives.

DODGERS ESCAPE BRAVES, 4-3, PULL WITHIN 8 OF REDS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: MARTINEZ EARNS HIS 13TH VICTORY AS THE CLUB GAINS GROUND ON 
CINCINNATI FOR THE SIXTH CONSECUTIVE DAY.

<P>
During spring training, Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda told Ramon Martinez he was 
capable of winning 15 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked at me," Lasorda said, "like I was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
That is the same look Lasorda has received when he has said his Dodgers still 
are in the pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last week, he is being taken more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' 4-3 victory over the Atlanta Braves Sunday at Dodger Stadium 
before 34,975 was the club's fourth in a row and sixth in the seven games of 
the home stand. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, 51-48, picked up ground on the slumping Cincinnati Reds for the 
sixth consecutive day. Thirteen and one-half games back at the low point, the 
Dodgers are eight behind, the closest they've been since May 31. 
</P>
<P>
In the next 11 days, the Dodgers will play the teams ahead of them five times 
each. The Reds will start a two-game series tonight at Dodger Stadium. The 
second-place San Francisco Giants will follow for a makeup game. Then, the 
Dodgers will play four in Candlestick Park and three in Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were losing, people were walking around with their heads down," Dodger 
third baseman Lenny Harris said. "But we've played too much baseball to fall 
down now." 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, the Dodgers beat the Braves despite leaving a club-record 25 men 
on base. Saturday, they won despite trailing by three runs with two out in the 
ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, a key blow was a pop fly in the fifth inning by Alfredo Griffin that 
Atlanta second baseman Mark Lemke lost in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"Right from the start, I didn't judge it right," said Lemke, who was filling in 
for the injured Jeff Treadway. "By the time I looked up, I had lost it in the 
sun. You don't want to lose sight of the ball."' 
</P>
<P>
When he did, it fell behind him for a single that gave the Dodgers two base 
runners with one out and the score 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez sacrificed to advance the runners before Stan Javier hit a two-run 
single. After Javier stole second, Mike Sharperson singled him home. 
</P>
<P>
Sharperson had scored the Dodgers' first run in the first inning. His double 
had been followed by ball hit by Kal Daniels that bounced over Lemke's head. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez (13-4) struck out nine in eight innings and walked only one. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw some high pitches," Martinez said. "Today, I did not feel like I felt 
before. So, I tried to throw some breaking balls." 
</P>
<P>
Those high pitches produced only two groundouts all afternoon. And the Braves 
teed off on several. Jimmy Kremers tripled to right in the third inning and 
scored Atlanta's first run on a sacrifice fly by Lonnie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The other two Brave runs came on home runs: Jim Presley's 17th of the season 
deep into the left field pavilion in the seventh inning and pinch-hitter Tommy 
Gregg's fourth to right field in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Crews took over for Martinez in the ninth inning, but the Braves didn't go 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Gant opened up the final inning by laying down what looked like a perfect 
bunt. 
</P>
<P>
But home plate umpire Ed Rapuano motioned Gant back, indicating the ball had 
hit him. 
</P>
<P>
Gant had to be restrained as he went after Rapuano. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the game, Gant remained incensed. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the ball) didn't touch me," he insisted. "When he called me back, I 
thought the ball had rolled foul. But it didn't come close to me. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, from where (Rapuano) was standing, he couldn't see anything. The 
third-base umpire called it fair. He or the first-base umpire could see, but 
not the guy at home plate. He must have been in a hurry to get the game over. 
That's the only explanation I can think of." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long after that. Gant bounced to third, Presley flied to right 
and Dale Murphy struck out. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Dodgers were this close to the division lead, they also were 
playing Cincinnati. The Reds then won three in a row, outscoring the Dodgers, 
15-5. 
</P>
<P>
"The Reds don't mean a hill of beans to me," said Daniels, a former Red. "They 
are just another ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Starter Charlie Leibrandt (4-4) took the loss for Atlanta. . . . Although he 
continues to struggle, the Dodgers will give Terry Wells another shot at the 
fifth spot in the rotation. He has been announced as the starter for 
Wednesday's game against the Giants.

This is what happens when you don't care enough to send the best. 
</P>
<P>
This is what happens when the heart of your national collegiate champion, Larry 
Johnson and Stacey Augmon of Nevada Las Vegas, take their invitations, wad them 
up and bank a couple of three-pointers into the circular file. 
</P>
<P>
This is what happens when the best amateur jump-shooting talents in the land -- 
Dennis Scott, Jeff Fryer, Steve Smith -- never make it to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
This is what happens when a 7-foot rim-crusher named Shaquille O'Neal is 
dispatched to terrorize teen-agers at the Olympic Festival but not the 
Europeans at the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
Losses to the Soviet Union happen. 
</P>
<P>
Losses to Yugoslavia happen. 
</P>
<P>
Silver medals happen. 
</P>
<P>
In case the events of Seoul '88 were forgotten, Sunday night's gold-medal game 
at the Goodwill Games reminded all involved that the days when the United 
States could suit up the B team and still win international tournaments are 
long gone. When Yugoslavia beats the United States, 85-79, on the Americans' 
home court and looks impressive doing it, you know the rest of the world has 
caught on to the Americans' game. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia beat the United States without its two top players -- Vlade Divac 
and Drazen Petrovic -- and after a third, Zarko Paspalj, went down in a heap in 
the first five minutes because of a badly sprained ankle. What kind of losses 
were these? Divac (the Lakers), Petrovic (Portland Trail Blazers) and Paspalj 
(San Antonio Spurs) all played in the NBA last season. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the rest, 6-11 center Dino Radja, scored only nine points after 
sitting out most of the second half because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
So, Yugoslavia pretty much was down to the junior varsity -- and the United 
States still had to look up on the victory stand. 
</P>
<P>
If U.S. Coach Mike Krzyzewski got off the plane in Seattle, looked around and 
was satisfied with the backcourt he brought north, pass the blame his way. The 
Americans played the entire tournament without a legitimate shooting guard; 
when Arkansas' Lee Mayberry proved a bust, forward Todd Day replaced him in the 
starting lineup. And when All-American point guard Kenny Anderson succumbed to 
a severe case of spotlight jitters, the U.S. outside game went out to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
No team in the eight-country Goodwill field shot as poorly as the United 
States, which finished the five-game tournament at 38%. And the Americans saved 
the worst for last. Sunday, the U.S. backcourt was a combined six for 27. Day 
was one for 12. Anderson was four for 10. Mayberry, who missed all five of his 
shots in Tuesday's upset loss to the Soviets, made only one of five shots 
against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
The United States trailed most of the game -- by three points at halftime and 
by 72-65 with six minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Yankee ingenuity hit a new low. 
</P>
<P>
Jurij Zdovc, Yugoslavia's leading scorer with 21 points, missed a free throw. 
The Americans couldn't wait to rebound. Mark Randall came crashing in from the 
left side. Doug Smith powered in from the right. 
</P>
<P>
Both players tipped the ball -- into the basket. 
</P>
<P>
For the Americans, it was the play of the tournament -- the definitive play of 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Through Yugoslav foul attrition -- first Radja fouled out, then Radisav Curcic 
(10 points) -- the United States hung in long enough to pull within 81-78 with 
1:48 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia missed a shot. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans rebounded and passed to Doug Smith, who drove inside and missed. 
Billy Owens rebounded and whipped the ball back to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The ball hit Smith in the hands and bounded out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
The clock showed 42.2 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia retaliated with a basket by Zoran Savic, its lead was 83-78 and the 
Americans were on their way to their second defeat in four games. 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski blamed the defeat on the Americans' youth and the Yugoslavs' savvy. 
He used the same routine after the loss to the Soviets. He said his team was 
using the Goodwill Games to tune for next month's world championships in 
Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
But by then, Divac and Petrovic will be back in Yugoslav uniforms. And the 
Soviet Union expects to regain one or two of its Lithuanian gunners. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy anymore.

CARBAJAL IS VALEDICTORIAN OF U.S. BOXING CLASS OF '88

Michael Carbajal stopped Thailand's Muangchai Kittikasem in the seventh round 
of a battle of unbeaten 108-pounders Sunday afternoon and became the first 1988 
U.S. Olympic boxer to win a world professional championship. 
</P>
<P>
And afterward, nearly everyone was predicting this bout would be the start of 
something big for boxing's little guys. 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal, a Seoul silver medalist who was fighting before his hometown fans in 
Veterans Memorial Coliseum, drew 8,221 to see him win the International Boxing 
Federation light-flyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
The gate was $250,732, easily an Arizona pro boxing record and believed to be 
the largest U.S. gate ever for a light-fly or flyweight fight. 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal, who earned $75,000 plus about another $20,000 as his share of 
proceeds exceeding $150,000, beat a rugged champion who seemed to run out of 
gas as the fast-paced bout proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
Kittikasem, 10-1, had great difficulty making 108 pounds at Friday's weigh-in. 
He arrived in Phoenix July 20 weighing 119 pounds, weighed 114 Friday and was 
109 1/2 two hours before the 5 p.m. Friday weigh-in. For two hours before the 
weigh-in, he jumped rope wearing a rubber sauna suit in 104-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very strong early in the fight, but later I could feel him weakening," 
said Carbajal, who has no problem making the light-flyweight limit. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, talk was of a big-money match with Mexico's Humberto (Chiquita) 
Gonzalez (28-0), the World Boxing Council light-flyweight champion, or with the 
South Korean World Boxing Association titlist, Yuh Myung Woo (34-0). 
</P>
<P>
Kittikasem, who earned $150,000 from promoter Bob Arum, will make another 
$50,000 from Thai television and yet another $50,000 when Arum buys back 
Carbajal's first-defense option for which Kittikasem signed. 
</P>
<P>
After Carbajal had his championship belt Sunday, Arum talked boldly of 
maneuvering Carbajal into a $1 million purse when he meets Gonzalez in 
mid-1991, providing both keep winning. 
</P>
<P>
By the third round Sunday, Kittikasem was flatfooted and relatively immobile, 
but he remained a dangerous puncher to the end. Several times he rocked 
Carbajal with short hooks to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal, slightly taller and with a longer, slightly more effective jab, 
knocked Kittikasem down four times, the final time 14 seconds into the seventh 
round when Tucson referee Bob Ferrara stopped it. Kittikasem was also down 
twice in the fourth round and once in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
By far the stronger, busier fighter at the finish, Carbajal, 22, said will and 
conditioning made him a champion. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no stopping me today. . . . I've been waiting for this day since I 
was six," he said. "I expected a tough fight and it was. He was tough, he kept 
getting up. But I was in great shape." 
</P>
<P>
Kittikasem, who was defending his title for the fifth time, scored several 
times to Carbajal's head midway through the sixth round, but never hurt him. 
Seconds later, Carbajal had moved out of the corner and flattened the champion 
with a hard right to the chin. Kittikasem went down on his back, got up with a 
vacant stare, took an eight-count and was taking more punishment when he was 
saved by the bell. 
</P>
<P>
Between rounds, Danny Carbajal, the new champion's brother and trainer/manager, 
told his fighter to jump on Kittikasem quickly in the seventh. Carbajal doubled 
up the Thai with a body shot, then followed with two lefts and a right to the 
head. Kittikasem crumpled, and Ferraro quickly waved Carbajal off. 
</P>
<P>
"The body shot was the punch that finished him. I really dug it in and he 
doubled over," Carbajal said. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of Kittikasem's strength-draining struggle to make 108 seemed 
apparent early in the fourth round. He had Carbajal backed up on the ropes but 
missed him badly with wild punches, after which he simply backed up, fists 
down. Shortly after that, Carbajal put him flat on his back with a straight 
right to the chin. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment when he became a champion, Carbajal leaped to the bottom strand 
of ropes and waved happily to his 3-year-old nephew, Danny, at ringside. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to wave first to my nephew Danny because this was his first trip to 
one of my fights," he said. "After every one of my fights, he's been the first 
one to greet me at the door. He'd see me coming and he'd yell: 'Let's get ready 
to rumble!' " 
</P>
<P>
For the shy Carbajal, that's a speech. He was asked who was the best of the 
three unbeaten light-flyweight champions. 
</P>
<P>
"Me," he said.

LEWIS WINS 100, CAPS RELAY VICTORY;

TRACK: ATTEMPT FOR WORLD RECORD GOES BY THE WAYSIDE WHEN HE SUFFERS FROM

<P>
Carl Lewis anchored the Santa Monica Track Club's 400-meter relay team to 
victory and won the 100-meter dash at the New York Games Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After taking a poor baton pass from Floyd Heard, Lewis began the final 
100-meter leg about a half-meter behind Tony Dees of the Florida Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
But about 40 meters later, Lewis was in the lead. Instead of bursting through 
the tape, however, Lewis slowed before it and the winning time was 38.18 
seconds, short of the world record of 37.83 set by the 1984 U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
The meet's promoters had offered a $50,000 bonus to a relay team breaking the 
world record. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Witherspoon led off for Santa Monica and was followed by Leroy Burrell, 
Floyd Heard and Lewis. The team had won in 37.93, the world's best time this 
year, at Barcelona, Spain, July 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little tight going into this race," Lewis said. "I tightened up and 
cramped. I still thought we had a chance at the record, but I'm happy we won." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, with Andre Cason, Daron Council, Michael Johnson and Dees, 
finished second in 38.25. 
</P>
<P>
About two hours before the relay, Lewis fought a 15-m.p.h. headwind and won the 
100 in 10.38 seconds, far slower than his world record of 9.92. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Lewis trailed early before spurting ahead near the 60-meter mark and 
beating Santa Monica teammate Mike Marsh by about 1 1/2 meters. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the fourth in five starts for Lewis this year, his only loss 
coming against Burrell in the 100 meters last week in the Goodwill Games at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, two-time world champion Greg Foster overcame the strong headwinds to 
win the men's 110-meter high hurdles, beating two-time Olympic gold medalist 
Roger Kingdom.

GARRELTS MISSES NO-HITTER BY ONE OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the San Francisco Giants this season, it has been a case of as Scott 
Garrelts goes, so goes the team. 
</P>
<P>
Garrelts, who was the earned-run average leader (2.28), and with a 14-5 record 
also had the best winning percentage (.737) in the National League last season, 
was off to a horrible start. So were the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Garrelts is sizzling and so are the Giants. They even won a game the other 
night when Garrelts, as a pinch-runner, scored the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the 28-year-old right-hander missed by one out Sunday at San Francisco 
of becoming the eighth pitcher in the majors to pitch a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Paul O'Neill lined a single to center to spoil the no-hitter, but the red-hot 
Giants beat the faltering Cincinnati Reds, 4-0, before 55,792, the largest 
Candlestick Park crowd of the season, to sweep the four-game series. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds have lost seven in a row. The sweep enabled the Giants to pull to 
within 5 1/2 games of Cincinnati in the National League West. It's the closest 
San Francisco has been since April 24 and the Reds' smallest lead since June 
12. 
</P>
<P>
A two-run home run in the eighth gave Garrelts (9-7), who has won eight of his 
last nine decisions, breathing room in a tight battle with Jack Armstrong 
(11-7). 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, who were 11 games behind after losing to the Dodgers Tuesday night, 
have won five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most surprising thing about Garrelts' performance was that it came 
at Candlestick Park. He has pitched most of his worst games there this season. 
With the win, he is only 3-6 at home. His first five starts were at Candlestick 
and he didn't win any of them. His first win was May 12 at Philadelphia and he 
didn't win at home until he held the Reds to four hits in seven innings in a 
6-1 victory June 5. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not as disappointed as you might think," Garrelts said. "I just wanted to 
throw strikes and win the game. The no-hitter was definitely secondary to the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"O'Neill hit a fastball right down the middle. If my arm felt better I'd 
probably shot for the corners more. But my arm started stiffening earlier and I 
had a tough time keeping the ball down." 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark singled in a run in the first and singled and scored in the sixth, 
but Reds Manager Lou Piniella thought Kennedy's homer was the big blow. 
</P>
<P>
"That home run was really big for them," Piniella said. "If the score's only 
2-0 at that point, anything could have happened in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the way we're playing, but the consolation is that we are still 
in first place and have to be caught. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a game of peaks and valleys, but we've been in the valley too long. 
Right now we're at the desert's floor, but we're not in Death Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Giant Manager Roger Craig wasn't ready to gloat. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't get much better than winning four in a row from the club you're 
trying to catch," he said. "All the games were exciting, but Garrelts 
performance was the topper." 
</P>
<P>
While there have been six no-hitters in the American League already this 
season, the Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela has the only one in the National 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Garrelts, in his seventh season, never had better than a three-hitter before 
his one-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 2, Philadelphia 1 -- The Pirates turned to their most effective 
pitcher, Doug Drabek, to stop their skid. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates had lost four in a row and were in danger of being swept at home by 
the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Drabek had a problem with his control, but the Phillies couldn't hit him. 
Drabek (13-4) gave up just two hits, one Darren Daulton's sixth home run, but 
he walked seven and was in constant trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Drabek struck out eight and improved to 8-2 after Pirate losses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to me every fifth day," he said. "Everybody goes through slumps. I was 
in one for a month and everybody picked me up. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, I didn't care how bad I looked as long as we won. It was a hot day (88 
degrees), probably the hottest I've worked. I was glad to I was able to get 
through it. I probably was tired, but I wasn't aware of it. I was concentrating 
on winning." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds drove in one run with a single in the fourth and Jose Lind drove in 
the other with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 2, Montreal 1 -- Rookie Mike Harkey followed his worst start with a 
solid performance at Montreal. He gave up four hits in 7 1/3 innings and the 
Cubs slowed the Expos bid to get into the race in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday at St. Louis, Harkey retired only one batter before being chased. He 
gave up six hits, two walks and eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 4, Houston 3 -- Jack Clark hit a two-run homer off bullpen ace Dave 
Smith in the eighth inning at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros led, 3-2, there were two out and Tony Gwynn was on base when Smith 
was summoned to face Clark. The count went to 3 and 2 before Clark drove the 
ball over the left-field fence for his 17th home run. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Harris (5-5) got the victory, although he gave up a run in the top of the 
eighth that gave the Astros the lead. 
</P>
<P>
New York 6, St. Louis 0 -- This win at New York meant more than just keeping 
the Mets a game ahead in the East. 
</P>
<P>
It proved that there was nothing wrong with Dwight Gooden. Gooden, who delayed 
his start two days because of a strained shoulder, pitched a strong seven 
innings to improve his record to 11-5. He gave up six hits. 
</P>
<P>
His task was made easier when catcher Mackey Sasser hit a grand slam in the 
fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Willie McGee had one of the hits off Gooden to extend his hitting streak to 20 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden was concerned because a shoulder problem forced him to miss the second 
half of last season. DAN HAFNER

The Baltimore Orioles traded outfielder Phil Bradley to the Chicago White Sox 
for first baseman Ron Kittle, Oriole spokesman Bob Miller said late Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, a 31-year-old right-handed hitting outfielder, is in the last year of 
his contract with the Orioles and was eligible for free agency at the end of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, hitting .270 with four home runs and 26 RBIs, had expressed 
displeasure at the course of recent contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said both players are expected to report to their respective new teams 
in time for tonight's games.

NEWSWIRE: FALCONS DON'T WANT TO SHARE DEION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Atlanta Falcons threatened "enormous financial consequences," including the 
return of a $2-million signing bonus, if cornerback Deion Sanders signs a 
contract with the New York Yankees to play baseball through the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Falcon President Taylor Smith said he told Sanders' attorney, Eugene Parker, 
during a meeting in Atlanta Sunday that the Falcons were "prepared to take all 
action necessary to enforce our rights" under the four-year, $4.4-million 
contract Sanders signed last September. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' base salary for the upcoming football season is $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Parker nevertheless "indicated to us that Deion Sanders was close to 
a deal with the New York Yankees that would require him to play out the entire 
1990 season and the entire 1991 baseball season." 
</P>
<P>
A new baseball contract would mean that the earliest the .153 hitter could be 
available for a regular-season football game would be the Falcons' Oct. 7 
meeting with New Orleans, their fourth game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees reportedly have offered Sanders a contract with a base salary of $1 
million.

ROBINSON LASHES OUT AT HOLDOUT SLATER; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: VETERAN GUARD IS SEEKING TO RENEGOTIATE CONTRACT, WHICH REPORTEDLY IS FOR 
$550,000 THIS SEASON. HE'S BEING FINED $1,000 A DAY UNTIL HE REPORTS. 
</P>

<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson, using his strongest language to date, reprimanded 
14-year veteran tackle Jackie Slater on Sunday for holding out of training camp 
while being under contract. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson also said that Slater, a team captain and six-time Pro Bowl selection, 
is being fined $1,000 per day during his holdout, which began last Wednesday 
when Ram veterans reported to camp at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a contract and has violated the terms of that contract," Robinson said. 
"I think he's out of line in what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Slater, who has been unavailable for comment, is trying to renegotiate his 
contract for 1990, which reportedly will pay him $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said Slater's reputation as a team leader and his years of service to 
the organization do not excuse his absence from camp. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a very responsible player here, a very responsible person here," 
Robinson said. "But his responsibility continues. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because he's been a great player, and an outstanding person in the past, 
he still has a responsibility to this team to be here. In my view, the tact 
he's taking is not going to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Slater, 36, said he plans to play two more seasons. If he does and remains 
healthy, he will break franchise records for most seasons, 16, and games 
played. 
</P>
<P>
Slater enters his 15th season with the Rams, tying him on the team's all-time 
list with Charlie Cowan and Joe Scibelli. 
</P>
<P>
As for games played, Slater, with 194, trails only Merlin Olsen (208), Cowan 
(206), Jack Youngblood (202), Scibelli (202). 
</P>
<P>
If Slater plays 16 games in each of the next two seasons, he'll finish with 226 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Bern Brostek, the team's first-round draft choice from the University of 
Washington, signed a five-year contract and reported to camp. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal were not available. The Rams had reportedly been offering 
Brostek the same four-year, $1.8-million deal they gave Cleveland Gary last 
year. The two sides compromised by adding another year to the length of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Brostek, who was drafted as a center/guard, will be used exclusively at center 
this season, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have time to learn two positions," Robinson said. "We feel good 
about our guards -- (Joe) Milinichik, (Duval) Love, and (Tom) Newberry. If we 
ever have a disaster, I think (center) Doug Smith is probably more equipped to 
play guard than Brostek, rather than asking a guy to do both." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating his signing, Brostek flew from his home in Hawaii to California 
late Saturday night. Brostek said he never wanted to hold out for one minute, 
let alone 18 days. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be here on the first day (July 11), he said. "It's time to play 
some football." 
</P>
<P>
Brostek, the heir apparent to eventually take over veteran center Smith's 
position, will spend his first season in a learning role. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have to come in and fill a hole," Robinson said. "He's here in a 
support role initially, we hope, and feel from what we've seen, that he's 
capable of playing in a responsible way in the NFL his first year, which 
doesn't happen very often for offensive linemen. He's probably just as well off 
to be in a support role." 
</P>
<P>
Brostek, 6-feet-3 and 300 pounds, said he hopes to catch up with his teammates 
quickly. He spent one month after the April draft working out with the team in 
Anaheim. He's ready to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever they want me to play, I'll play," he said. "I heard center. I'll help 
any way I can." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Receiver Flipper Anderson bruised his tail bone Sunday and was held out of the 
evening practice. . . . The Rams have yet to sign their second-round draft 
choice, safety Pat Terrell, and four veterans -- defensive end Kevin Greene, 
safety Michael Stewart, defensive lineman Doug Reed, and tight end Damone 
Johnson. Running back David Lang, the team's 12th-round choice, is also 
unsigned, but he probably won't play this season because he's serving out a 
prison sentence for receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
With Brostek's signing, the team must release one player to meet the roster 
limit of 80. The Rams depart for Berlin, Germany, next Saturday for an Aug. 11 
exhibition game with the Kansas City Chiefs.

Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball, convicted of manslaughter two years ago 
when he drove his car into a crowd and killed two teen-agers, says he feels 
constant remorse about the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while, I've been wanting to come forward, but it's very difficult to 
talk about these things. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't take it in stride," Kimball told The Tampa Tribune in his first 
interview since being sentenced to 17 years in prison in January of 1989. 
</P>

Kimball has served 19 months of his sentence for the Aug. 1, 1988 incident in 
Brandon, Fla., that killed two and injured six. He was legally drunk at the 
time his sports car rammed into the group. Kimball pleaded guilty and never 
spoke publicly about his feelings -- leading families of the teen-agers to 
believe he didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview at Marion Correctional Institution in Ocala, Fla., Kimball, 27, 
also said he was a drug abuser at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Primarily cocaine, marijuana and alcohol is what I used. I was cross-addicted 
to all those," Kimball said.

POTENTIAL CUP DEFENDERS FACE NEW FEES

<P>
Any euphoria that the four survivors felt last month when the America's Cup 
Defense Committee excused other potential defenders has vanished. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was being seeded into the semifinals. Instead, the four "licensed" 
syndicates learned by mail the next day that they would have to come up with 
$50,000 by Wednesday and another $50,000 by Oct. 1 to support Partnership for 
America's Cup Technology (PACT), the committee-backed design research group, 
and must provide proof by Oct. 1 that they have a minimum of $6 million in the 
bank to build their boats. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, two or three of the excused groups who failed to show an 
"ability" to raise $6 million by the initial June 28 deadline are refusing to 
quit -- and the committee said they could rejoin the game if their financial 
prospects dramatically improve. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, nobody is really in or out at this point. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do it," said Larry Klein, skipper and leader of the Triumph America 
Foundation, "but it bothers me that the rules are changed." 
</P>
<P>
Rival Peter Isler said: "The October deadline was news to us. I guess they want 
to ensure they have a strong defense." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry LaDow, president of Dennis Conner Sports Inc., said: "The syndicates feel 
they've been blindsided. The 50-50 just came out of the blue. We're not happy 
about it. It shouldn't be a deal-breaker for anybody, but it's an irritant. You 
wonder, what's next?" 
</P>
<P>
Bob Spriggs, chief executive officer of the Beach Boys USA syndicate, said: 
"I'm not seriously concerned. I don't have a signed contract with any major 
sponsor in hand, (but) I don't think the (committee) is going to be in position 
to really play hardball at that point." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what if there are no $6-million men out there on Oct. 1? Wouldn't the 
committee look a little silly with its deadlines? 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Tom Mitchell said: "I don't think there's any doubt that we're going 
to play hardball with 'em. We don't have time to fool around. Look at the 
date." 
</P>
<P>
It takes about six months to build one of the new America's Cup class boats; 
none of the Americans has started, and the first world championships are 
scheduled off San Diego next May, a year ahead of the Cup defense. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Ehman, executive director of the committee, indicated that he is more 
interested in results than hard-luck stories, adding: "Keep in mind, the 
defender has lost the last two times out -- forgetting (the catamaran defense 
in) '88." 
</P>
<P>
Isler is also concerned that encouraging the excused syndicates to continue to 
promote themselves is diluting the available corporate sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's enough to support five superpower-level syndicates," he 
said. "Maybe only three." 
</P>
<P>
Isler has one major backer, Hewlett-Packard. Conner recently signed Cadillac 
for $3 million, putting him well ahead of the others. 
</P>
<P>
But the Beach Boys are contributing only their name and talent -- no money -- 
to their effort, and Klein has yet to announce a major supporter. 
</P>
<P>
There also are misgivings and confusion about PACT, which has the defense 
syndicates sharing information from research on computerized fluid dynamics 
applicable to the new class. PACT was the brainchild of John Marshall, Conner's 
former design chief who thought the overall defense would be better served by a 
combined effort in the preliminary design work. 
</P>
<P>
"PACT is not designing a boat," LaDow said, "(but) the basic question is when 
does PACT stop? (At some point) syndicates are not going to want to share." 
</P>
<P>
Some seem already near that point. "We're told to donate $100,000 to PACT 
whether we like it or not," Klein said. "We feel there is something of value in 
there for us, but we're doing this (research) on other fronts, too." 
</P>
<P>
Isler said: "The first round of PACT was really valuable. It honed our 
computational tools. Now it's a different game. By October we'll have a boat 
under construction. I have a feeling that PACT will dissolve as a matter of 
course." 
</P>
<P>
The defense syndicates also have been put on notice to ante up a $150,000 
performance bond by July of next year or fold. 
</P>
<P>
It is no surprise that Conner is ahead in fund-raising, capitalizing on the 
national perception that he is the America's Cup as he hustles potential 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't understand that Dennis isn't necessarily going to be the defender," 
Klein said. "He loves that confusion, and the (committee) isn't doing much to 
clear up that confusion." 
</P>
<P>
Ehman denied that. "We have made it clear to every (potential) sponsor that 
it's sharks in the tank. Nobody has any guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
The Beach Boys will help raise money for developer David Lowery's team, but 
Isler is skeptical of that syndicate, despite the presence of veteran Cup 
campaigner John Bertrand of Newport Beach as skipper. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather sail against the Beach Boys than Bertrand," Isler said. "But 
they're just getting started. I'm waiting and seeing." 
</P>
<P>
Just to cover himself, Isler is saying, I'll see your Beach Boys and raise you 
one. He has enlisted David Crosby and Graham Nash of Crosby, Stills and Nash, 
along with James Taylor, to promote his team. 
</P>
<P>
Will that mean harmony, at last, in the America's Cup? 
</P>

<P>
Nance Frank, who already has posted her U.S. Women's Challenge entry for the 
1993-94 Whitbread Round the World race, is leading the first foreign crew to 
compete in the All Union Onega Cup Regatta on Lake Onega east of Leningrad. The 
race started July 26 and is scheduled to end Aug. 5. Frank, unable to compete 
in the recent Whitbread for lack of money, plans to continue to train with a 
Soviet all-woman crew until the '93 event. . . . Oaxaca, Jim Ryley's Santa Cruz 
50 from Santa Cruz, was the overall winner of the West Marine Pacific Cup from 
San Francisco to Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, correcting out to 9 days 4 hours 27 
minutes 57 seconds from an actual time of 9:11:21:57. It was the first ocean 
passage for Ryley but the 20th for his navigator, Skip Allan. Gene Twiner's 
Santa Cruz 70 sled Kathmandu was first to finish in 8:15:11:08, about 3 1/2 
hours ahead of Tim Clark's Meridian, with Oaxaca next. . . . The Ullman 
Sails/PHRF championship Regatta is scheduled for Aug. 10-12 out of the Seal 
Beach Yacht Club, with Alamitos Bay YC the co-host. The event is open to all 
boats with ratings between zero and 276. Entry fee: $45 before Aug. 1, $60 
after Aug. 1.

STREET SMART: AIRPORT OFF-RAMP THEORY WON'T FLY; 
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC: SOUTH COUNTY RESIDENTS HAVE ONLY SINGLE-LANE ACCESS FROM THE SAN DIEGO 
FREEWAY TO JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT. COULD IT BE RETRIBUTION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: On July 7, you discussed improvements to provide better 
access to the Orange County Airport from the north -- and how nice they will 
be. 
</P>
<P>
Now how about those you missed? Everyone who comes from the south won't see any 
improvement. There is only one lane off the interstate, even though it looks 
like there could be two with some restriping. Or is this "punishment" inflicted 
because those in the south are fighting an airport in the area? 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Wilson 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano 
</P>
<P>
Hmmmm. Conspiracy theories are always intriguing, but it sure would be picayune 
of the powers who control our roads to pound on all those southerners just 
because they don't want commercial jets buzzing their red clay-tile roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the California Department of Transportation in Orange County say 
the MacArthur Boulevard off-ramp, the major conduit to the airport for folks 
headed north, has not had problems funneling traffic off the San Diego Freeway, 
something that couldn't always be said for the southbound off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, if the number of cars using an off-ramp exceeds 1,500 an hour, the 
agency will add an additional lane to funnel traffic off the freeway, Caltrans 
officials said. The northbound off-ramp to MacArthur Boulevard just doesn't top 
that threshold, they maintain. 
</P>
<P>
The off-ramp is most heavily used during the morning rush hour. Between 6 and 7 
a.m., nearly 1,000 cars exit there, but that total rises to about 1,400 for 
each of the subsequent hours, Caltrans said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a majority of those cars are actually turning right, heading toward 
the office parks straddling MacArthur Boulevard and away from the airport. 
During the peak hours between 6 and 8 a.m., about 1,500 cars turn left toward 
the airport, while about 2,250 typically turn right, according to Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, most residents of South County would probably love an exit similar 
to the new transition road off the southbound Costa Mesa Freeway, which ferries 
motorists right to the new airport terminal. The Costa Mesa Freeway was 
selected for that special exit because studies showed that far more drivers 
traveling to the airport were coming from the central county, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
So South County motorists will have to contend with the MacArthur Boulevard 
exit as it is -- and feel pleased that there's not an airport in the back yard 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
It's always been the sort of sage advice that Grandpa passed on: Buy a big car 
because the small ones aren't as safe in an accident. Now there's some proof. 
</P>
<P>
An analysis conducted by the Highway Loss Data Institute found that small cars 
were three times more likely to be declared a total loss after an accident than 
were large cars. The rate of total loss for mid-size cars was twice that of the 
large models, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
The Yugo had the highest percentage of total losses for 1988 model cars, with 
one out of every five collisions involving a total loss, the study reported. 
Others with high rates of total losses include the Ford Festiva and Chevrolet 
Sprint. The lowest rate was recorded by the Lincoln Town Car, with fewer than 
one out of 50 collisions resulting in a total loss. 
</P>
<P>
Before you run off and trade in your Toyota for a Cadillac, remember that small 
cars have their advantages aside from being a bit flimsy in a crash. They 
typically deliver far better gas mileage and, in some cases, performance.

RUDE AWAKENING FOR 'DREAM HOUSE' BUYERS; 
</P>
<P>
LAND DISPUTE: OWNERS OF 100 HOMES BUILT ON 96 ACRES THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO 
REMAIN OPEN SPACE ARE WAITING TO SEE HOW THE SITUATION IS RESOLVED. DESPITE 
REASSURANCES, THEY REMAIN UNEASY.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Marina Hills resident Rick Mortensen opened his newspaper one morning and 
found a front-page story with a map of his neighborhood, it was "kind of a 
novelty." But as more articles appeared almost daily, Mortensen began to worry. 
</P>
<P>
Especially troubling to Mortensen were accounts of a stormy City Council 
meeting at which angry environmentalists demanded that the public be 
compensated for the loss of 96 acres of land which had been set aside in 1985 
as open space to buffer the Salt Creek Corridor Regional Park from development. 
</P>
<P>
Since May the Orange County district attorney has been trying to find out how 
the land wound up in the hands of Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd. 
Mortensen and his wife, Fayme, own one of about 100 homes that now stand on the 
disputed land. 
</P>
<P>
"I read about the people pounding the table and saying, 'I want my 96 acres 
back. . . .' " Mortensen said. "I'm just afraid people will forget about the 
people who live here." 
</P>
<P>
Mortensen and his wife managed to save enough to "squeak in" to their first 
home in April. They paid $300,000 for their "dream house": a two-story, 
red-tile-roofed home that sits on a corner lot, a bike ride from the ocean, 
with three bedrooms and fourth room that will "hopefully" become a nursery. 
</P>
<P>
"You can really see the stars at night and it's crisp and clear," the 
29-year-old computer consultant said. "We lived in an area in L.A. that was 
near a sewage plant and a petroleum plant. You wouldn't even want to go out at 
night." 
</P>
<P>
The land dispute now hangs over them like the smog they left behind in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago Laguna Niguel officials announced plans to sue Taylor Woodrow 
over the property and to try to take back the land not yet built upon. The 
council also imposed a moratorium on new building permits for the property. 
Council officials have assured homeowners like Mortensen that they will take no 
action against them and that the controversy will in no way cloud the title to 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Executives from Taylor Woodrow and the title insurance company that backed the 
purchase of their homes gave similar assurances at a meeting last week with the 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Mortensen is uneasy. "I just hope that things work out, that we get to 
keep title to our house, that the powers that be recognize there's a bunch of 
little people that could get hurt by all this." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is 96 acres lying just north of the Salt Creek Corridor Regional Park. 
It was set aside as open space in a 1985 deed to the county from AVCO-Bredero 
Niguel, then the major developer in the area. The county later passed its 
rights to the land to the Laguna Niguel Community Services District. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1988, Laguna Niguel Councilman James F. Krembas, then the district 
vice president, signed a deed to Taylor Woodrow relinquishing the public's 
right to the land. Krembas has said he signed the deed under the mistaken 
belief that it was part of another transaction. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, company executives have maintained that the transaction was 
approved by other members of the district board as well as county officials. 
The land transfer has become the focus of a criminal inquiry, in part because 
Krembas' wife was hired by Taylor Woodrow three months after Krembas signed the 
deed. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the company requested a rehearing before the City Council in an 
attempt to stave off the threatened suit and to rescind the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Caught in the cross-fire are the homeowners who live on the property in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little shocking to read about it and then look at a map and realize 
your house is in the area they're talking about," said Eric Moore, a 
32-year-old fire battalion chief who moved into his Calella Street home in May. 
"Here you are in a house you think is your dream house and all of a sudden 
you're in a controversial thing." 
</P>
<P>
When Eric Moore hears other citizens demand a return of their parkland, he 
worries. "I just hope other people know we are victims," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sandy and Mike Brown, who moved in two months ago, said they were reassured 
by the meeting last week with Taylor Woodrow President Gordon Tippell and a 
representative of the title insurance firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the development," Mike Brown said. "I just think there was a 
miscommunication." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said some of his neighbors worry about a "worst-case scenario" in which 
the city would take back the land, despite its assurances to the contrary, and 
the residents would lose their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners were disturbed to learn at the meeting last week that, should the 
city seize the land, the title insurance company would reimburse them only for 
the price they paid for the home, and not for any appreciation or money spent 
on home improvements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That made everybody a little uneasy," Brown said, but he added, "I just don't 
think the city would do anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from the Browns live Amy and Ronald Zitka and their three 
children. Had he known of the land controversy earlier, Ronald Zitka said, he 
would have reconsidered the move. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be caught up in any controversy," Zitka said, and then 
wondered aloud what effect the dispute might have on resale value: "Will that 
have a negative impact on the sale here if they're continuing to fight it out?" 
</P>
<P>
Standing amid a garage full of boxes, Gerrie Glossip, whose home backs up to 
Salt Creek, said the parkland behind her home is her main concern. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason we bought this is because that was supposed to be park and we 
want it to stay that way," said Glossip. "I don't want to pay extra for this 
home because it looks out over a park and it not be a park." 
</P>

UCI OPENS SCIENCE LABS TO MINORITY STUDENTS

<P>
Sitting around their teacher in low-slung yellow and blue chairs at UC Irvine 
last week, the kindergartners sang in Spanish: "There is a little sea star at 
the bottom of the sea." 
</P>
<P>
Beside a sunny window in another room, third-graders in tiny white lab coats 
picked up a sea cucumber to peer at its underside and learn how an anemone 
feeds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, high school students in a science lab kept their eyes on a gadget 
that measured the time it took for an enzyme to cause a chemical reaction in 
liquid. 
</P>
<P>
In halls of learning usually reserved for young adults, the students, mostly 
Latino, are spending part of their summer in "Kids Inventing and Discovering 
Science," a novel UCI program that brings minority students to a college campus 
to turn them on to the excitement of science. 
</P>
<P>
In English and in Spanish, they are learning about the world around them, from 
sea creatures to the fundamentals of microbiology and natural gene selection. 
For three weeks, 60 children from kindergarten to third grade have been taking 
field trips to the beaches and the tide pools of Orange County, and 60 high 
school students will be immersed for six weeks in sophisticated laboratory work 
that makes their regular studies look like first-grade homework. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, it's hard," said Coleen Mahone, an 11th-grader at Sherman Indian High 
School near Riverside. "But when you go back to school, you'll be ahead of 
everybody else, and you'll know what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
The program was the brainchild of Dr. Eloy Rodriguez, a UCI professor of 
biology and phytochemistry widely known for his research in plants and 
medicines. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that while he does not normally work with children, he is 
interested in programs that "socialize" Latino and other minority youths to 
science in the hope that they may see it as a potential career. Even more 
important, he said, is to encourage them to see themselves as learners and 
thinkers in a society where alarmingly high numbers of Latino children drop out 
of school. 
</P>
<P>
The elementary school children are mostly the sons and daughters of maintenance 
workers at UCI or the children of the Irvine Co. laborers who live in an Irvine 
mobile home park. They are all Latino. 
</P>
<P>
The high school students, all from ethnic minorities but not necessarily 
Latino, were chosen from applications from a variety of high schools throughout 
Southern California. Many were not faring well in their regular schools, 
Rodriguez said, but so far enthusiasm and participation in the program have 
been high. 
</P>
<P>
Funded by several grants, including one from the Howard Hughes Biomedical 
Research Foundation, the program tries to provide a delicate balance of 
elements that Rodriguez believes are missing in other school settings. 
</P>
<P>
A native of south Texas, Rodriguez recalled that his high school counselor 
advised him to enroll in a vocational trade school instead of college, even 
though he skipped one year of school after scoring well on tests and graduated 
in the top 5% of his class. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have minorities in the classroom at many schools around here, these 
are kids who are generally not called upon by the teacher to answer questions," 
he said. "There is some stereotyping about them. We believe that with time and 
attention paid to kids, they will do well. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the parents came up to me the other day and wanted to know what we 
were doing to their kids, because on the weekends their kids were actually 
asking, 'When are we going to go back to school?' " 
</P>
<P>
Recently, U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos attributed the failure 
of Latino students in school to lack of parental participation. Rodriguez said 
his program is showing that parents of Latino children are eager to take part 
if school officials approach them in the proper way. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, when the elementary school children went on a field trip to the 
tide pools at Corona del Mar State Beach, parents were invited, and many of 
them went. They also were encouraged to ask questions about the sea life their 
children were studying. 
</P>
<P>
Many of their questions were asked -- and answered -- in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents are an integral part of what we're doing," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
All of the teachers working in the program are bilingual, and most of them are 
Latino. They were deliberately selected, Rodriguez said, to provide the 
children with role models from their own cultures. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the workshop, the children were asked to draw a picture of 
a scientist. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them had men with beards; some of them wore lab coats," Rodriguez 
said. "But not one of them drew a woman scientist. We're going to ask them to 
do the same thing at the end of the program, and I'll bet you the drawings will 
be very different." 
</P>
<P>
At the elementary-school level, the children had classes on insects, plants and 
marine life. 
</P>
<P>
But the primary approach is to get the children to study real-life objects, 
such as sea creatures, around them and to consider theories and concepts of 
science, said teacher Mercedes Merrell. 
</P>
<P>
"This is hands-on science," she said. "They are also learning critical 
thinking, which teaches them to remember things longer, process it faster and 
utilize it in other situations." 
</P>
<P>
By looking for plants, insects and sea animals in their natural habitats, 
handling them or dissecting them to view under a microscope and then discussing 
how they fit into the broader food chain and evolutionary scale, the children

"The resources at the university are tremendous," Merrell said. "They have the

<P>
The three Japanese surfers who walked into Jack's Surfboards didn't bat an 
eyelash at the $360 price tags for new surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
They just pointed to a dozen shiny new boards displayed on a rack and, without 
haggling over prices, told the salesman, "We want that one, that one and that 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Traveler's checks were hurriedly signed for the amount, which, with tax, came 
to $1,150. That business finished, they then asked, "Which way is Trestles?" 
</P>
<P>
"They always say they want to go to Trestles," said store manager Shawn 
Shehadeh, who drew the visitors a map and sent them on their way down Pacific 
Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Once a rare sight, today hundreds of Japanese, Australian and Brazilian surfers 
and other surfing travelers make a point of visiting Orange County each year, 
according to surf shop owners and industry experts. Many are not leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"To the foreign traveler, California is a paradise. But aside from surfing, a 
lot of them come here because of the lifestyle," said Thomas K. Brimer, owner 
of the Frog House surf shop in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, more than any other location in the world, is a surfing mecca. 
More surfboard makers and more manufacturers and distributors of surfing 
apparel, wet suits, body boards and related water equipment are in Orange 
County than anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"I think California is the most modern of all the surfing places in the world," 
said Emerilson (Gio) Gil Emerin, 21, who left his native Brazil and has been in 
Huntington Beach for a year. "It's got the best equipment in the world, the 
surf here is good, it's got the best girls, and the best people. 
</P>
<P>
"You walk in a surf shop in Brazil, and you find maybe one or two different 
kinds of wet suits. Here, you get 10 kinds of wet suits and 10 different 
manufacturers," Gil Emerin said. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese arrive hoping to turn a small profit from their California trips. 
Like eager traders eyeing pork bellies, the Japanese buy surfboards low and 
sell high, taking advantage of a phenomenal demand in Japan for U.S.-made 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
With gasoline at $3.82 a gallon, other petroleum-based products such as 
surfboards are exorbitantly expensive in Japan. In addition, having few 
surfboard shapers -- people who sand and shape a surfboard blank into the 
finished product -- means that California-made boards sell for $800 to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan," said Tokyo-born Takayuki Wakita, 18, who is staying in San Clemente 
for two months, Japanese-made "surfboards sell for $700. Everything is 
expensive and everybody wants an American-made surfboard." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese come with tons of money. They are well-versed on surfing and 
surfing lore, although they have trouble pronouncing the surf spots, and they 
"try and buy anything" related to surfing, Shehadeh said. 
</P>
<P>
"They buy an off-the-rack board for $360, use it for two months while they're 
visiting here, then sell it in Japan for $800, and it helps pay for their 
trip," Shehadeh explained, adding: "They're willing to pay for the big names 
with big bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Current favorite surfboard models among the Japanese include those by Channel 
Islands Surfboards of Santa Barbara. The board's popularity stems in part from 
several visits to Japan by Channel Islands Surfboard owner Al Merrick and by 
Tom Curren, one of the world's most popular professional surfers, who is 
sponsored by Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
To the Japanese, surfing in Orange County is a serious business. But to the 
Brazilians, Orange County is a fun place to party. For the Australians, it's a 
combination of everything. Cultural perspectives can often get ruffled, said 
Brazilian Gil Emerin, who told a story about the time he took a girlfriend to 
Huntington Beach late at night. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting on the beach around midnight and all of a sudden we hear this 
loud voice saying: 'The beach is now closed. Go home!' I said, 'What do you 
mean, the beach is closed?' 
</P>
<P>
"Then a Jeep pulls up and this cop tells us again, 'The beach is closed. You 
have to leave.' I argued. I mean, who can close a beach? In Brazil, our beaches 
are open . . . all the time. Only God can close a beach." 
</P>
<P>
For surfer Robert Bogie from Bell's Beach, Australia, his native land's rural 
coastline and natural beauty beats California's, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But in California, it has a certain je ne sais quoi (I don't know), a certain 
little something extra," Bogie said. 
</P>
<P>
Bogie, a 27-year-old accountant, landed at Los Angeles International Airport 
six weeks ago. Typical of most surf travelers, he didn't know anyone and had no 
place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed overnight on the beach in Santa Monica with the homeless people. The 
next day I hitched a ride to a surf shop at Zuma Beach. I bought a board, 
surfed and met two women from Perth and West Germany. A week later, we drove 
down to Newport Beach, and we've been sharing expenses ever since," Bogie said. 
</P>
<P>
Bogie has surfed in Portugal, Bali and Hawaii. But when he first visited Orange 
County three years ago, he remembered what it was like to see the pier at 
Huntington Beach for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a reputation because it was featured in some of the (surfing) 
magazines. I think that the Huntington Beach Pier, in regards to the California 
surf scene, represents a certain amount of nostalgia, and it's that nostalgia 
you feel while sitting on the pier with the wind on your face and the sun 
shining on you. It's a buzz to realize that all the world champions of surfing 
surfed here."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; 
</P>
<P>
BICYCLIST, 7, INJURED WHEN STRUCK BY CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 7-year-old bicyclist remained hospitalized Sunday after he was hit by a car, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Cruz of La Habra was taken by helicopter to UCI Medical Center in Orange 
shortly after the collision about 8:15 p.m. Saturday, La Habra police said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy suffered internal injuries and massive trauma to one leg and was 
scheduled to undergo surgery late Saturday night, Lt. Joe Milazzo said. 
Hospital officials, however, declined to discuss the boy's condition Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told investigators that the boy was traveling south on Ipswich Street 
on a 15-speed Huffy bicycle shortly after dusk Saturday when he rode into the 
path of a Ford Pinto traveling west on Keene Street, Milazzo said. 
</P>
<P>
The speed of the car had not been determined Sunday, but witnesses told 
investigators that there were no lights operating on the bike or reflectors at 
the time of the crash. Police said there were no traffic signals or stop signs 
at the intersection of the two residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Pinto, a 77-year-old La Habra man, was not cited pending 
further investigation, Milazzo said.

PROPOSED TREE PANEL FAILS TO TAKE ROOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a recent public furor over plans to remove almost 100 trees, a proposed 
committee to oversee the city's thousands of trees has died for lack of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have enough people to commit the time," said Director of Public 
Works Robert Beardsley. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an extensive campaign to spur interest, only four residents applied for 
the positions. At least five members were needed to form a quorum, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff had proposed the committee to help deal with the hundreds of 
calls the city gets each year regarding trees. 
</P>
<P>
During the past four months, 55 people complained to the city about property 
damage caused by parkway trees. Other callers asked about trimming schedules 
and tree removal, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent decision to remove nearly 100 trees for a redevelopment project caused 
an outcry in the community. Because of the outcry, the building project was 
postponed until the tree committee could be formed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the City Council will act as the committee, Beardsley said. 
</P>
<P>
The council will review each project before it goes out to bid, giving 
residents the chance to state their concerns. During the next few months, major 
plans for tree removal and sidewalk repair are expected to be completed.

NONPROFIT GROUPS MAY EASE DEARTH OF AFFORDABLE HOMES; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: ORGANIZATIONS DEDICATED TO BUILDING HIGH-QUALITY, LOW-COST UNITS ARE 
EMERGING AS A SECOND-TIER REAL ESTATE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRADLEY INMAN, Bradley Inman is a columnist who specializes in California 
housing issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a disease with no cure, finding solutions to Orange County's and 
California's affordable-housing mess has baffled policy-makers for at least a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of the breakdown are grim. The homeownership rate in the state 
has fallen below 50%, more than 700,000 Californians live in overcrowded 
conditions, and 1 million residents pay 40% or more of their income on rent. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has a simple explanation: Personal incomes can't keep up with the 
cost of housing. Solutions are more elusive. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, California residential real estate values increased by nearly $75 
billion. But incomes only grew an estimated $12 billion. Include $1 billion in 
state, federal and local housing aid, and $62 billion was added to the state 
housing deficit last year alone. 
</P>
<P>
Fat with equity, homeowners benefit from this trend, but finding solutions for 
people who are stuck renting is one of the state's most pressing challenges. 
This gap is dramatic in Orange County, where the median home price is $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, remedies to the housing malaise involve taking one of two tacks: 
increasing the supply of housing, or forcing developers to offer affordability. 
</P>
<P>
At real estate industry conferences, "supply, supply, supply" is proffered as 
the panacea for high housing costs. The build-your-way-out-of-the-problem 
approach holds that increasing supply to meet demand will stop the price spiral 
and wipe out the affordability gap. 
</P>
<P>
Another scenario mandates that private property owners and developers come to 
the rescue. The theory says that since real estate interests benefit from 
property inflation, it's fair to require developers to include a certain 
percentage of affordable homes in every new project. Rent control also fits 
into this strategy. 
</P>
<P>
However, neither of these two approaches -- leave it to the free market or 
redistribute the wealth -- have done much to solve the state's housing ills. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a third approach is taking shape that may hold out hope for 
long-term solutions to the current muddle. 
</P>
<P>
With government aid and corporate philanthropic contributions, nonprofit groups 
are popping up all over the country with a mission to produce high-quality, 
low-cost housing. A second-tier real estate market is emerging that specializes 
in affordable homes and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are now between 1,500 and 2,000 community-based housing 
development groups. Organized as tax-exempt, public-purpose groups with special 
access to government funds, they have built nearly 125,000 housing units. 
</P>
<P>
These grass-roots organizations have become the darlings of state and federal 
lawmakers. Every major housing bill approved in the last several years has 
targeted money for nonprofit housing groups. In the coming years, they will 
have exclusive access to more than $1 billion in state and private funds that 
are earmarked for housing in California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very political, palpable way to privatize the job of building and 
managing low-cost government housing," says Michael Yaki, an aide to Rep. Nancy 
Pelosi (D-San Francisco). "By letting community-based groups do it, you 
eliminate layers of bureaucracy, and they tend to humanize the design of the 
units and give the residents more control over their homes." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most successful residential developers is a nonprofit corporation. 
Bridge Housing Inc. of San Francisco has no stockholders, no earnings and no 
profit, but its developments suffer few vacancies, frequently win design awards 
and are affordable to entry-level home buyers and low-income renters. 
</P>
<P>
Credited with building 3,000 units in the last seven years, Bridge ranks as the 
37th largest builder in Northern California. The organization is expanding its 
operation to Southern California with projects planned in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
By vowing to use government funds exclusively for the production of low-cost 
housing, nonprofit groups also promise long-term affordability. They own and 
maintain the units that they produce, guaranteeing that they remain affordable. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, government aid programs were used to give incentives to private 
developers for building low-cost housing. But requirements on affordability 
often lasted no longer than 10 to 15 years. Nonprofit groups, on the other 
hand, often guarantee permanent affordability. 
</P>
<P>
These new organizations don't replace the private market. Home builders will 
continue to build to the middle and upper income groups, and private firms will 
often join in ventures with nonprofit groups for the part of the market that is 
too often ignored.

WHEN THE PARTY'S OVER, WHO CLEANS UP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORNA COHEN, Lorna Cohen is a writer in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the tea party in "Alice in Wonderland," Alice is baffled at the number of 
place settings per number of guests until the Mad Hatter explains: "It's always 
tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles." 
</P>
<P>
"Then you keep moving round, I suppose?" said Alice. 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly so," said the Hatter: "as the things get used up." 
</P>
<P>
Here in Laguna Beach, and all over Orange County, things are getting used up. I 
have a number of friends who have dealt with that problem by the Mad Hatter's 
method. They have moved round. They have bailed. As in, "I'm outta here." 
</P>
<P>
Some of my friends were prescient about things getting used up in Orange County 
while the rest of us were still too busy having a great time at the tea party. 
But now with the traffic congestion, and the houses marching over the hills 
into the ocean, I've started to think about bailing too. 
</P>
<P>
But there are problems. My friend who moved up to Carmel over a decade ago, 
claiming she couldn't breath the air down here, now writes to say she's bailing 
to Oregon or Washington. Carmel is used up, she says. She sounds a lot like the 
Hatter: "I want a clean cup, let's all move one place on." I hear the same 
refrain from my friends who bailed to Santa Fe and Mendocino. Things are 
getting used up there too. 
</P>
<P>
If you're going to bail, you'd better be sure to bail far enough away from your 
fellow bailers to avoid landing on them, lest the place one bails to begins to 
look just like the place one bailed from. 
</P>
<P>
Why do the bailers re-create the very conditions they seek to escape? It's 
simple. You can't get away from it all because you are it. You can't not take 
it with you. 
</P>
<P>
I have tried to convince myself that I would be the exception. I would bail to 
the one remaining pristine spot on Earth and bring the drawbridge up behind me. 
Of course, it would have to be someplace that no one else found very 
attractive, or else I'd risk landing on fellow bailers. Once there, I would be 
sure not to despoil the land. I would buy green, and recycle everything. But 
even if I could get used to the idea of being a dog sled ride from the store, 
not to mention poppy seed bagels, repertory theaters and carnitas (you need 
population for these), I still don't think I'll bail. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you move on several times, eventually you'll be back to your own seat 
again. Alice realized this. "But when you come to the beginning again?" Alice 
ventured to ask. "Suppose we change the subject," the March Hare interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
But suppose we don't. What does happen when you come to the beginning again? Or 
your children do? The planet isn't large enough to offer everyone a clean plate 
at the buffet of life. Eventually someone's got to do the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
I can understand why the people in Washington and Oregon are upset with 
California immigrants who cash in on their metropolitan homes and metropolitan 
incomes and move on to greener pastures which they then turn brown. 
</P>
<P>
I'm upset with the bailers too. What I'm upset about is that they came to the 
tea party and left before time to clean up. That's why I'm not bailing. 
Somebody's got to do the dishes.

FAMILY OF 3 CAN'T COME HOME AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
A SINGLE MOTHER WHO LEFT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH HER SONS TO EARN A MASTER'S 
DEGREE TRIED TO RETURN LATER AND FOUND THE COST OF LIVING HAD CLOSED THE DOOR 
ON HER FAMILY.

<P>
Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine we would leave Southern California 
again and return to Utah State University in Logan, Utah, where I had graduated 
in 1971. Going backward felt uncomfortable. But I wanted to earn a master's 
degree in communications and knew, as a single parent paying $630-a-month rent, 
it would have been impossible to do at home. 
</P>
<P>
So I accepted a graduate teaching assistantship at USU. The job paid $400 a 
month plus tuition and I was told we could find a furnished two-bedroom 
apartment for about $275. Student loans would also help. The boys, then 9 and 
12, helped move all our belongings into storage and we headed out of Orange 
County east on the Riverside Freeway toward the Intermountain West -- where the 
living was cheaper and easier. 
</P>
<P>
The three of us looked forward to our new adventure. We were a little 
battle-weary of the chaotic Southern California lifestyle: the bumper-to-bumper 
traffic, the smog, the crowds. But like many native Californians it was our 
home, and we knew we would be back in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State University lies in beautiful Cache Valley surrounded on three sides 
by the majestic Wasatch mountains. 
</P>
<P>
For two years we enjoyed the simplicity and the beauty of this lovely 
university town. School became my whole life. The boys were content in their 
new, safe environment. 
</P>
<P>
When I finally graduated, I felt a sense of pride in my accomplishment, and the 
boys were proud of me too. We were ready to return home, find a new place to 
live in Orange County and reap the financial rewards commensurate with my 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
To my complete and naive surprise, I found it wouldn't be quite that simple. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, professional communications jobs in Orange County are highly 
competitive. I applied for a public relations position in Newport Beach that 
pulled in 300 applications. Though I made the top 16 who were given interviews, 
I did not make the final cut. 
</P>
<P>
I was offered a full-time reporter's job on a weekly newspaper for $9,600 a 
year and a technical writing job at a computer company for $16,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
How could anyone survive in Orange County on salaries like those, unless they 
were still living at home with parents? Housing costs had gone sky high in the 
two years we had been away. 
</P>
<P>
Without realizing it, I had let the door to Southern California quietly close 
behind us. 
</P>
<P>
We've been gone five years now and I still don't see any way in the near future 
of getting back. Let's face it, even if I were to find an opening in my field, 
the salary would probably not cover the high cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
In Utah, we've been able to maintain a fairly decent lifestyle. As director of 
public relations at Logan Regional Hospital, my career is blossoming. 
Financially we are getting back on our feet. 
</P>
<P>
But not without regrets. No matter how hard we try, Utah doesn't feel like 
home. Perhaps if I knew then what I know now about the difficulties of 
returning, we might never have left Southern California. I don't know. But I do 
know that no matter what the developers do to it, or how crowded, frenzied or 
expensive it becomes, the energy, the diversity that makes California special, 
also makes it home.

MIKE PENNER: YUGOSLAVS SEND BEST, BEAT U.S.

This is what happens when you don't care enough to send the best. 
</P>
<P>
This is what happens when the heart and soul of your national collegiate 
champion, Larry Johnson and Stacey Augmon of Nevada Las Vegas, take their 
invitations, wad them up and bank a couple of three-pointers into the circular 
file. 
</P>
<P>
This is what happens when the best amateur jump-shooting talents in the land -- 
Dennis Scott, Jeff Fryer, Steve Smith -- never make it to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
This is what happens when a 7-foot rim-crusher named Shaquille O'Neal is 
dispatched to terrorize teen-agers at the Olympic Festival -- the Olympic 
Festival -- and not the Europeans at the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
Losses to the Soviet Union happen. 
</P>
<P>
Losses to Yugoslavia happen. 
</P>
<P>
Silver medals happen. 
</P>
<P>
In case the events of Seoul '88 were forgotten, Sunday night's gold-medal game 
at the Goodwill Games reminded all involved that the days when the United 
States could suit up the B team and still win international tournaments are 
gone, gone, long gone. When Yugoslavia beats the United States, 85-79, on its 
home court and looks impressive doing it, you know the rest of the world has 
caught on to the Americans' game. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia beat the United States without its two top players -- Vlade Divac 
and Drazen Petrovic -- and after a third, Zarko Paspalj, went down in a heap in 
the five minutes with a badly sprained ankle. What kind of losses were these? 
Divac (the Lakers), Petrovic (Portland Trailblazers) and Paspalj (San Antonio 
Spurs) all played the NBA last season. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the rest, 6-11 center Dino Radja, scored only nine points after 
sitting out most of the second half because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
So, Yugoslavia pretty much was down to the junior varsity -- and the United 
States still had to look up on the victory stand. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball all around the world has grown up," said Dusan Ivkovic, coach of 
the turbo Yugos, "and now is very, very close with American college basketball. 
American people must understand that now." 
</P>
<P>
American people may not understand how Coach Mike Krzyzewski got off the plane 
in Seattle, looked around and claimed to be satisfied with the backcourt he 
brought north. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans played the entire tournament without a legitimate shooting guard; 
when Arkansas' Lee Mayberry proved a bust, forward Todd Day replaced him in the 
starting lineup. And when the All-American point guard, Kenny Anderson, 
succumbed to a severe case of spotlight jitters, the U.S. outside game went out 
to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
No team in the eight-country Goodwill field shot as poorly as the United 
States, which finished the five-game tournament at 38%. And the Americans saved 
the worst for last. Sunday, the U.S. backcourt was a combined five for 31. Day 
was one for 12. Anderson was three for 10. Mayberry, who missed all five shots 
in Tuesday's upset defeat to the Soviets, proved to be no fluke and came back 
with a crisp one for five against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
The United States trailed most of the game -- by three points at halftime and 
by 72-65 with six minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Yankee ingenuity hit a new low. 
</P>
<P>
Jurij Zdovc, Yugoslavia's leading scorer with 21 points, stood at the free 
throw line and clanked a foul shot off the heel of the basket. The Americans 
couldn't wait to rebound. Mark Randall came crashing in from the left side. 
Doug Smith powered in from the right. 
</P>
<P>
Both players tipped the ball . . . into the basket. 
</P>
<P>
For the Americans, it was the play of the tournament -- the definitive play of 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they should have tried the same thing when one of their guards cast off 
one of their bricks. 
</P>
<P>
Through Yugoslavian foul attrition -- first Radja fouled out, then Radisav 
Curcic (10 points) -- the United States hung in long enough to pull within 
81-78 with 1:48 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia missed a shot. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans rebounded and passed to Doug Smith, who drove inside and missed. 
Billy Owens rebounded and whipped the ball back to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The ball hit Smith right in the hands and bounded out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
The clock showed 42.2 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia retaliated with a basket by Zoran Savic, its lead was 83-78 and the 
Americans were on their way to their second defeat in four games. 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski, of course, blamed the defeat on the Americans' youth and the 
Yugoslavs' savvy. "Our kids are young and still not cohesive," he said. "I 
think it's fine for the U.S. to (expect the gold medal) and work towards that, 
but we also have to be realistic and know that there are foreign players in the 
NBA and that the foreign players are men and that there's a possibility we 
could lose to them." 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski used the same routine after the Soviet defeat. He said his United 
States team was using the Goodwill Games to tune up for next month's world 
championships in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Divac and Petrovic will be back in Yugoslavian uniforms. The Soviet 
Union expects to regain one or two of its Lithuanian gunners. 
</P>
<P>
Tune up? Has Krzyzewski considered trading in this lemon? 
</P>
<P>
Good thing the Olympics remain two years in the distance. By then, the 
Americans plan to arrive, for the first time ever, with NBA players on the 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson ought to be able to take care of that 
backcourt problem.

SATELLITES STAY IN BAR-BAND ORBIT AT COACH HOUSE 
</P>

<P>
Life is too short to drink bad beer, the saying goes, and a similar maxim 
should apply to bar bands. Along with whatever unaffected good-rockin' they may 
represent, the sad truth is that most bar bands are numbingly commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
There are certainly some groups that elevate party music to a high art, but the 
Georgia Satellites seemed more fated to rank as just another band when they hit 
in 1986, unequal to the attention brought by their left-field hit "Keep Your 
Hands to Yourself." Their Coach House show Saturday, however, had moments that 
suggested the quartet may yet attain the sublime. 
</P>
<P>
While the songwriting, singing and playing that went into the 24-song show 
didn't offer much in the way of individuality or virtuosity -- some points go 
to Rick Richards for his snarling slide-guitar work -- they pumped plenty of 
spirit into several songs. The "White Album" Ringo track "Don't Pass Me By" 
became a hard-rocking hot rod in their hands, matched by their own "Shake That 
Thing" and "Saddle Up." Richards fronted a smoldering ballad version of the 
current "All Over But the Cryin' " while co-singer/guitarist Dan Baird led an 
uproarious, free-flying "Dan Takes Five." 
</P>
<P>
If more of their delivery were as unfettered, the Satellites would vie for 
greatness, but those moments were spread thin over a two-hour show. It was 
ultimately fatiguing hearing a group whose cultural matrix begins and ends with 
the Faces, with even such roots staples as "Great Balls of Fire" and George 
Jones' "White Lightning" filtered through a '70s crunch-rock sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
And like many a corner bar band, their covers of such songs as the Ramones' "I 
Wanna Be Sedated," Elvis' "Suspicious Minds" and the Stones' "Let It Bleed" and 
"No Expectations" did nothing to wrest the tunes away from their original 
owners. Richards did earn one distinction with the latter song, though, when he 
stuck two burning cigarettes on his guitar's peghead, one more smoke than even 
the most stellar British guitar heroes have attempted. 
</P>
<P>
Opener Private Life was an unspectacular, metal Lite outfit. Guitarist Danny 
Johnson had a nicely edged, distorted tone and some speed runs that recalled 
the band's album producer, Eddie Van Halen. Singer Kelly Breznik had a workably 
shrill post-Benatar voice. Combined, they provided a version of Van Morrison's 
"Domino" that could likely put Morrison to sleep and then give him nightmares.

Friday's "Battle of the Saxes" to benefit the area's homeless didn't end up 
benefitting very many people -- other than those who were paid to help out. 
According to Earline Carroll, who organized the benefit concert in which 
saxophonists Big Jay McNeeley and Chuck Higgins squared off at the Saddleback 
Inn in Santa Ana, 125 tickets were sold for a total of $1,875. 
</P>
<P>
But when the costs of entertainment ($1,600), venue ($400), advertising ($270) 
and other incidentals were added in, Carroll found herself about $400 in the 
red. Carroll wasn't discouraged, though. She said she plans to begin organizing 
another benefit soon. "I came out a little short on this one, but that's OK," 
she said. "I'm going to go back next time and do it right." She added that no 
"name" entertainment will likely be asked to contribute next time.

'CHORUS LINE' TO LEAD PERFORMING ARTS CENTER'S BROADWAY SERIES

<P>
Productions of five Broadway musicals, including the first touring versions of 
two current hits and the "farewell" tour of the longest-running show in 
Broadway history, have been announced by the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center for next season. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with "A Chorus Line" in November, the Center's 1990-91 Broadway 
Series will include "Grand Hotel" in April, "Meet Me in St. Louis" in May, "Les 
Miserables" in June and "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" in July. 
</P>
<P>
The series, to be announced today in a prepared statement, is being touted by 
Center officials as a coup because of the acclaim garnered by the original 
productions and the fact that key artistic personnel will remain connected with 
several of the costly touring versions. 
</P>
<P>
Center officials also point to what they call the relatively fresh currency of 
the shows, which has not always been the case at the Center. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Tune, who won two Tony Awards earlier this year for directing and 
choreographing "Grand Hotel" on Broadway, will re-create the $5-million musical 
for the road production, which itself will cost several million dollars to 
launch, according to a spokeswoman for the tour's New York producers. It is 
expected to go on the road in November, beginning in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"Grand Hotel," which won three other Tonys besides Tune's (though not for best 
musical), opened on Broadway eight months ago and is still running. Set in a 
luxury Berlin hotel in 1928, it tells the story of a lonely ballerina and her 
jewel-thief lover and is based on both the novel and play by Vicki Baum that 
also inspired the famous 1932 movie starring Greta Garbo and John Barrymore. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Robbins, who won a 1989 Tony for directing "Jerome Robbins' Broadway," 
has re-created his Broadway production (which is still running) for a 
multimillion-dollar touring version, to commence a four-month engagement at Los 
Angeles' Shubert Theatre in October. The show will then go to Japan for several 
months and will return to this country on an itinerary that will bring it to 
the Center next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerome Robbins' Broadway," which garnered a total of six Tonys (including best 
musical), is a song-and-dance anthology of numbers taken from the 
director-choreographer's work in shows dating back to the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
The producers acknowledge that Tony Roberts, who will star in the Los Angeles 
and Tokyo productions (as he did on Broadway, replacing Tony-winner Jason 
Alexander), has not yet committed to touring with the show on its return to the 
States. Nor have Debbie Shapiro and Scott Wise, who will re-create their 
Tony-winning featured roles in Los Angeles and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The national farewell tour of "A Chorus Line," which closed in New York in 
April after a record 6,137 Broadway performances, will retain the services of 
Laura Gamache, who starred in the production for the past year in the key role 
of Cassie. 
</P>
<P>
Although Michael Bennett's 1976 Tony-winning musical has become familiar to 
theatergoers nationwide through previous tours, a Hollywood movie, various 
professional stagings and uncounted amateur versions, both the tour producers 
and Center officials claim that theatergoers will flock to their production, 
which begins touring Oct. 1 in Cupertino. 
</P>
<P>
"Meet Me in St. Louis" is expected to cash in on nostalgia for the 1943 movie 
by Vincente Minnelli that is best remembered for Judy Garland's performance. 
It's a period piece, about the domestic adventures of an all-American family 
living on Kensington Avenue in turn-of-the-century St. Louis. The score, 
considerably expanded from the movie's, includes such tunes as "The Boy Next 
Door" and "The Trolley Song." 
</P>
<P>
The $4.2-million touring version of "Les Miserables" coming to the Center has 
been on the road since November and currently is playing in San Antonio, its 
67th booking. By the time it reaches Costa Mesa it will have played in 100 
theaters around the country, according to a spokesman for the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Subscriptions to the five-show series range from $95 to $209, up from last 
year's prices of $90.50 to $195). Single tickets for weekend performances also 
will go up, and will cost from $21 to $42 (last year the range was $19 to $40). 
Performances on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays will cost from $19 to $40. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

<P>
This is a cautionary tale, but I still haven't figured out what the moral is. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, I got a call from an associate of Holly Hughes, a New York 
performance artist whose work I reviewed last year when she appeared in Santa 
Monica. The woman on the phone told me that Hughes' National Endowment for the 
Arts grant proposal had been recommended for funding by the NEA's Theater Arts 
program. 
</P>
<P>
However, a story that had just appeared in the right-wing Washington Times said 
that NEA chairman John Frohnmayer was about to deny funding to Hughes and three 
other artists -- Tim Miller and John Fleck of Los Angeles and Karen Finley of 
New York -- because he wanted to mollify political opponents of the Endowment. 
Work by all four artists frequently involves imagery frankly intended to 
provoke middle-of-the-road viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' associate said she was calling various critics to ask them to write 
brief statements testifying to the artistic validity of Hughes' work, to be 
submitted to Frohnmayer. I had enjoyed the sly sexual humor of the text of 
Hughes' "World Without End" -- a piece she reprised this past weekend at 
Highways in Santa Monica -- and I found Hughes to be a witty and able 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
Before I composed my statement, I read the Washington Times story. It called 
Hughes "a solo performer and writer of theater skits." Apparently quoting from 
a review (whose author was uncredited), the story said that in Hughes' work, 
"World Without End," she "demonstrates how her mother imparted the 'secret 
meaning of life' by displaying her body and . . . placing her hand up her 
vagina." 
</P>
<P>
Her works "are less concerned with male-female relationships," the story 
continued, than "with lesbian desire" -- the latter words taken out of context 
from another uncredited review of Hughes' "Dress Suits to Hire." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with such descriptions -- sure to raise the hackles of many readers, 
including conservative members of Congress -- it seemed that I ought to 
describe Hughes' work in such a way that even someone who (let's say) secretly 
despised Lesbians might view it as eminently palatable and broadly humanistic. 
</P>
<P>
So my statement, which I faxed to Hughes in New York, said: "Holly Hughes' work 
involves a poetic transformation of the everyday activities of women into 
gestures that reveal the elemental sexual nature shared by all of humanity. She 
strips away social veneer to uncover the primal essence of her characters. This 
is art that treats the human condition in a metaphorical way, with lyricism, 
warmth and humor." 
</P>
<P>
Well, as you probably know, nothing anybody wrote in Hughes' defense seems to 
have made much difference. Without explanation, the NEA decided to withhold 
awards to the four artists. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a story in the Los Angeles Times reported that the NEA's advisory 
council is considering awarding Hughes and another member of the "NEA four" 
grants from an Inter-Arts program called Artists Projects: New Forms. But 
subsequently it was revealed that two members of the "peer review" panel which 
initially awarded the Theater Arts grants were also collaborators on Hughes' 
and Finley's proposed projects. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone involved apparently made a full declaration of potential conflict of 
interest at the appropriate time, and this situation is common in the tiny 
world of progressive art forms. (There simply are not that many "peers" to draw 
from at any given time.) But to the outside world -- and to some members of the 
independent commission appointed by President Bush to scrutinize the NEA's 
performance -- the situation smacked of impropriety. It hardly could have come 
at a worse moment in the life of risk-taking art forms. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, during the past few months of right-wing hysteria over 
non-mainstream art, I've become increasingly concerned about the problems 
involved in writing for "polite society" about visual and performance art that 
exists primarily to unsettle this society. 
</P>
<P>
One problem is that, while all good art is complex and takes time to fully 
explore, journalism -- as well as the hectic pace of contemporary life -- 
favors information that comes across with a minimum of elaborate and involved 
explanations. 
</P>
<P>
It is much easier to condemn a work by brandishing loaded words and phrases 
such as "lesbian desire" than to praise it by evoking the dense web of imagery 
-- achieved through words, movements, sounds and facial expressions -- that a 
performer can muster in her art. 
</P>
<P>
But even in attempting to write supportive commentary, reviewers are obliged to 
pick and choose the images we wish to discuss. And here's where we are 
increasingly in a bind. Do we tactfully ignore the aspects of a work that are 
deliberately disgusting or sexually frank in order to plead for the "universal" 
appeal of the work as a whole? 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that radical art is not about reaffirming the comfortable truths 
we already hold. 
</P>
<P>
Such work does make us uncomfortable from time to time. If we are heterosexual, 
we may be embarrassed at the degree of empathy we feel for homosexual feelings 
or experiences. Rooted in our self-defined notion of sexuality, whatever it may 
be, we may shy away from acknowledging "the other" in ourselves. We may laugh 
nervously at evocations of extreme states of human behavior, embarrassed to be 
eavesdropping so intently at such intimate or repellent scenes. 
</P>
<P>
But the works that make viewers uncomfortable or angry or both are provoking 
them to ask themselves, What do we really believe and why? Why do we act the 
way we do? Are we so imprisoned within the self-righteous paths we lay out for 
ourselves that we cannot for a moment consider a radically different point of 
view? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are works that are "on the edge" but also (we reviewers may 
think) bad art. Nowhere is it written that the further out you go, the better 
you get. But in condemning such work, we may worry that we are being 
misunderstood, that readers feel relieved to be spared "such filth" rather than 
simply a half-baked work of art. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that the more the arts have become enshrined as culturally 
mainstream activities, the more layers of misunderstanding have embalmed them. 
In decades past, avant-garde works of art, in particular, were seen and debated 
by tiny coteries. The rest of the world generally ignored them. 
</P>
<P>
But in our time, a Pageant of the Masters-style notion of the pleasantly 
"uplifting" role of art has been trumpeted by the media as well as well-meaning 
publicists at purse-weighing arts institutions throughout the land. In a way, 
it seems sadly unremarkable that people with no art background whatsoever are 
now complaining about the moral fitness of obscure work they normally would 
never see -- or even hear about -- if self-appointed right-wing crusaders had 
not spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the nay-sayers are said to be incensed about awarding of tax money 
(via the NEA) to art deemed objectionable. But many infinitely more far-ranging 
and expensive activities supported by our tax dollars have been objectionable 
to portions of the populace, from the development of the MX missile to the 
bailout of savings and loan institutions. It is utterly bizarre that people can 
be so distressed by the deliberately marginal activities of an artist with 
whose work they and their children probably will never come in contact. 
</P>
<P>
As I said, I don't have an answer to all this. I'm just brooding and waiting 
for better days. 
</P>

OPEC Action to Affect Gas Prices: Retail gasoline prices at the pump will 
either rise or stay level the rest of the year -- instead of falling as they 
normally do -- as a result of the OPEC cartel's agreement Friday to curb oil 
output, analysts said. Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, which pumps more than a third of the world's crude, agreed 
to hold output, which had risen to 24.6 million barrels daily in April, to 22.5 
million barrels.

Shevardnadze Calls IMF Timing Right: The time is right for the Soviet Union to 
join the International Monetary Fund, said Foreign Minister Eduard 
Shevardnadze. "Our country regards its membership of the IMF as a logical 
continuation of its policy of wider involvement in global economic 
cooperation," Shevardnadze told IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, 
according to the Tass news agency. Camdessus responded positively to 
Shevardnadze's proposal for talks, Tass said.

Private Saturn Ceremony: General Motors Chairman Roger B. Smith is scheduled 
today to drive the first production car off the $1.9-billion Saturn assembly 
line in Spring Hill, Tenn., but there will be no reporters and no politicians 
around, and only company photographers will record it. Bruce MacDonald, 
Saturn's vice president for communications, claimed that employees wanted a 
private ceremony alone with Smith, who retires as chairman on Tuesday. Industry 
analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Bros. Inc. said keeping the 
ceremony private might also be an effort by GM to lower expectations about the 
new nameplate.

BILL CALLS FOR HEALTH WARNINGS IN ALCOHOL ADS

Spuds McKenzie, the black-and-white dog that peddles a brand of beer, could be 
headed for the endangered species list if industry fears about a measure now 
before Congress come true. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation by Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., would require that all print, 
radio and television advertisements and promotional displays for alcoholic 
beverages include prominent health and safety warning messages detailing 
specific risks related to drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"As a society, we seem to be unwilling to even give the basic warnings," 
Kennedy said. "We'll let tens and tens of thousands of ads be shown on 
television to our children to have them think if they want to win that race, if 
they want to get the good car, find the prettiest girl, they have to drink. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's take advantage of the brains that God gave us and recognize that if 
there's some problem with a particular product, we probably ought to use it 
moderately or avoid it under certain circumstances," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
But groups representing the alcohol, broadcasting and advertising industries 
have massed in opposition to the plan. They say it would effectively lead to a 
ban on virtually all forms of advertising for beer, wine and liquor. 
</P>
<P>
Saying alcohol is a factor in half of the nation's motor vehicle deaths and 
homicides, Kennedy said his legislation is designed to combat alcohol abuse by 
giving the public the ability to make a "balanced and informed choice." 
</P>
<P>
James Sanders, president of the Beer Institute, called the legislation 
"prohibitionist." The trade association represents firms that produce and sell 
about 90% of the nation's beer, including industry giants Anheuser-Busch, 
Miller, Stroh's and Coors. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can tax it enough, if they can eliminate advertising, if they can mix 
it in with the drug war, then they will have achieved a prohibition without 
passing a prohibition amendment," Sanders said. "They feel that alcohol is the 
problem, not the people who drink it." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation calls for a rotation of five warnings in ads: 
</P>
<P>
* "Drinking during pregnancy may cause mental retardation and other birth 
defects." 
</P>
<P>
* "Alcohol impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery." 
</P>
<P>
* "Alcohol may be hazardous if you are using any other drugs such as 
over-the-counter, prescription or illicit drugs." 
</P>
<P>
* "Drinking alcohol may become addictive." 
</P>
<P>
* "It's against the law to purchase alcohol for persons under age 21." 
</P>
<P>
In print advertisements, the warnings would include a toll-free telephone 
number operated by the Federal Trade Commission to give information about 
alcohol abuse. In broadcast advertisements, the warnings would have to be read 
"in an audible and deliberate manner and in a length of time that allows for a 
clear understanding." 
</P>
<P>
Companion legislation sponsored by Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., is pending in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer groups and substance abuse experts have given strong support for the 
measure. The American Civil Liberties Union, however, has expressed its doubts 
about the constitutionality of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Health warnings have been required on alcohol product labels since last year.

Walt Disney Pictures Accused of Age Bias: A suit filed Wednesday by the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission accuses Walt Disney Pictures of 
discriminating against a 58-year-old executive assistant because of her age. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court suit, filed in Los Angeles, alleges that Sheila Barnes 
was discharged when a new, 36-year-old vice president of motion picture 
production told her she was being replaced because of a "generation gap" that 
existed between them. Barnes, who has more than 25 years of experience, was 
told to report to a lower-level position into which a 19-year-old with two 
years' secretarial experience eventually was hired, says the suit, which seeks 
reinstatement, back pay and damages. (Filed July 24, 2990. Case No. 90-3900)

Government Sues Grower Accused of Slavery: The Labor Department filed a lawsuit 
Wednesday against a Ventura County flower grower indicted on slavery charges, 
alleging that he owes at least $1 million in unpaid wages to about 400 illegal 
aliens. The U.S. District Court suit was filed against Griffith-Ives Co., an 
ornamental flower business, and its owner, Edwin M. Ives of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ives, his company and seven others are awaiting trial on 15 counts of slavery 
at the 50-acre farm in Somis, Calif. The civil suit alleges that about 400 
workers were grossly underpaid in violation of federal labor laws. The suit 
claims that Ives made inflated deductions from workers' pay for virtually 
everything -- including toilet paper and haircuts -- and seeks double the 
amount of back wages owed to workers. (Filed July 25, 2990. Case No. 90-3932)

Tool Orders Rose in June: Orders for U.S.-made machine tools rose 27.2% in June 
from the previous month, an industry trade group said in a report to be issued 
today. 
</P>
<P>
In the Assn. for Manufacturing Technology reported that machine tool orders 
totaled $262.7 million in June, up from $206.5 million in May, and up 9.1% from 
$240.7 million in June, 1989. Although the industry is relatively small, its 
activity is a key indicator of the strength of industrial production and is 
used by economists to gauge capital spending by manufacturers. Machine tools 
are used to make metal products ranging from cookware to complex weaponry.

SECURITIES: THE WILY FINANCIER IS A TAKEOVER VETERAN, BUT INVESTORS DON'T 
ALWAYS BENEFIT. NOW HE'S AT IT AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anybody who knows anything about the traps that await the unwary on Wall Street 
knows that to avoid disaster, you should follow three rules: Don't do big home 
repair jobs when the hardware stores are closed. Don't spit into the wind. And 
never, never, never become Meshulam Riklis' junior partner. 
</P>
<P>
There may be exceptions to Rules 1 and 2. But Rule 3 is ironclad. 
</P>
<P>
Most people who recognize Riklis' name know him from the gossip pages, where he 
is portrayed as the indulgent, elderly husband of Hollywood personality Pia 
Zadora. But to investors, Riklis is much less benign. Anyone who has owned 
stock or bonds in a Riklis company knows that Riklis somehow ends up with the 
cash and high-grade assets, and you end up owning paper that drops sharply in 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Riklis, who at age 66 has been playing takeover games for more than three 
decades, is at it again. This time, he's trying to take control of American 
Real Estate Partners LP, a big master limited partnership whose units trade on 
the New York Stock Exchange. AREP, as it's known, is run by the now-bankrupt 
Integrated Resources, which is trying to raise money to help pay its creditors 
by selling the company that controls AREP. 
</P>
<P>
Why am I reasonably sure that Riklis is up to mischief here? Because he's 
offering a price that isn't rational unless he plans to change AREP to his 
advantage -- and to everyone else's disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
Let me explain a little. AREP is the successor to 13 limited partnerships 
peddled by Integrated that actually turned out to have real value. The 
partnerships owned more than 300 properties leased to tenants, including such 
blue chips as K mart and Duke Power. In 1987, Integrated persuaded the limited 
partners to swap their units for units in AREP. As a master limited 
partnership, AREP has partnership units that trade on the NYSE like stocks, so 
they can be easily bought and sold. The other big sweetener was that Integrated 
promised that the units would pay $2 a year, which they have done. 
</P>
<P>
Integrated, in its typical fashion, shortchanged the investors somewhat by 
taking about 1.25 million units when the partnerships were transformed into 
American Real Estate Partners. That was in payment of future fees. Integrated 
also owns AREP's general partner, which controls the partnership and owns 1.99% 
of it. It's virtually impossible to dislodge the general partner, thanks to 
some cute provisions that Integrated stuck into AREP's charter. 
</P>
<P>
The units that Integrated owns produce about $2.5 million of distributions a 
year, and the general partnership interest produces about $600,000. How much 
would you pay for that $3.1 million a year, given that it has little chance of 
increasing? Not much more than $30 million. But Riklis is offering $40 million. 
That's almost $10 million more than the high bid, submitted by former AREP 
Chairman Richard Ader, at an auction that Integrated ran a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Riklis offering so much money? What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
AREP's charter allows the general partner to do deals with affiliates. That was 
fine when Ader ran the show, but it's a whole different thing if Riklis runs 
it. Riklis' proposed deal with Integrated has loopholes big enough to siphon 
millions of dollars through -- and AREP's assets are worth $250 million more 
than its debts. Starting in 1992, by my reading of the documents, Riklis could 
eliminate AREP's $2 distribution or sell his own assets to AREP at fancy 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
If you think I'm being unfair, remember that the last time we looked at Riklis, 
in January of this year, we saw how he had trashed the bondholders of E-II 
Holdings by taking cash out of the company and substituting properties and 
paper of questionable value. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing a Riklis raid, money managers Glen Bigelow of New York and Charles 
Jones of Shrewsbury, N.J., whose clients own AREP units, are circling the 
wagons and reaching for their guns. In other words, they have sued everyone in 
sight and are even trying to figure out a way for AREP's holders to buy out 
Integrated themselves. Which is how I came to hear about this deal. 
</P>
<P>
Bigelow, especially, is vehement on the subject of Riklis. He recalls that in 
1968, when he was a student at Harvard Business School, Riklis told the 
school's finance club that when he was a stockbroker, he would call people at 
random and say that a particular stock would rise in price and call other 
people to say it would fall. At the end of the day, then, Riklis had some 
potential clients who thought he was a genius. "I realized that this was a man 
who would say anything or do anything to get his hands on your money, and would 
then do whatever he wanted with it," Bigelow says. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know Riklis' side of this, because he wouldn't talk to me. Neither 
would Integrated Chairman Stephen Weinroth, who used to handle both the 
Integrated and Riklis accounts during his days as an investment banker at 
Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the bankruptcy court would have let this deal sail through, because 
Riklis was offering the highest price for an Integrated asset. But U.S. 
Bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman III is obviously trying to do what's right, 
instead of blindly approving the deal. He has appointed a special 
representative, New York Law School Prof. Karen Gross, to tell him whether 
limited partners in Integrated's partnerships have any rights in the bankruptcy 
proceedings. A hearing is set for September. 
</P>
<P>
Had AREP's buyer been someone with a better reputation, Bigelow and Jones would 
probably not have sued, and the deal would have gone through. But this time, 
Riklis' reputation has hurt him, and it might actually cost him the deal. Which 
proves that sometimes, a bad reputation is bad business.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE BEACON THAT WAS MURROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This . . . is London." 
</P>
<P>
Those famous words have crackled through history just as they did across the 
airwaves when Edward R. Murrow spoke them from a city aflame from German bombs 
in the early years of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Just as his voice then provided Americans with a daily link to the suffering of 
England, so does the mere mention of his name today connect us to the glory 
days of news broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Before he became the golden icon of television news, Murrow used radio to 
redefine war reporting, transforming his microphone into an electronic ear and 
informing listeners not about soldiers but about the unsung heroism of 
civilians. He spoke of death and destruction, of Londoners routinely filing 
into underground air raid shelters to escape the blitzkrieg, of "those 
black-faced men with bloodshot eyes . . . fighting fires." 
</P>
<P>
These days, of course, it's television news -- the business that Murrow 
literally invented while at CBS -- that's in flames. 
</P>
<P>
The point is vividly made in the two-part "American Masters" documentary 
"Edward R. Murrow: This Reporter." It's important and impressive. (The first 
part airs tonight at 10 on Channel 28, at 8 on Channel 50 and at 9 on Channel 
15, with Part 2 on Aug. 6. KVCR Channel 24 is running the programs on Friday 
and Aug. 10.) 
</P>
<P>
Murrow's reputation as a bold, innovative and steely principled journalist 
embraces not only his war reporting on radio, but even more so his TV series 
"See It Now," which became the prototype of the in-depth documentary when it 
ran on CBS in prime time from 1952 to 1955. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no such thing in life as a 100% hero, but if you're half a hero, 
that's a lot of heroism, and he was more than that . . . ," Eric Sevareid says 
glowingly tonight about the man who gave him his first job in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Murrow has been dead 25 years now, and our memories of him tend to be highly 
selective. Whether man and legend match, however, is not all that important. 
</P>
<P>
What is important is Murrow the symbol and beacon. Even for those who can't 
recall quite what it was he did (this documentary should remedy that), his name 
evokes awe and a high standard against which all other TV journalism is 
ultimately measured. Murrow was the industry's Abner Doubleday and Babe Ruth 
rolled into one, and no one in TV news since has even approached his hallowed 
status as a sort of divine spirit haunting the consciences of those who 
followed him. 
</P>
<P>
Many are guilty consciences, you'd suspect. 
</P>
<P>
In her first major documentary, Susan Steinberg opens up a time capsule for us, 
fusing a multitude of interviews, archival film and TV footage into a narrative 
seldom less than compelling. There's not much about Murrow the private man 
here, but as Steinberg remarked by phone recently, "He was his job, in a way." 
</P>
<P>
It was in response to the rising drum roll of war in Europe that CBS sent 
Murrow to London in 1937 to organize a network of correspondents there. These 
men would become known as "Murrow's Boys" -- they included Sevareid, Charles 
Collingwood, Howard K. Smith, Bill Shadel, Richard C. Hottelet, Larry LeSueur 
and William Shirer -- while joining their mentor on the front lines of World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
The radio segments selected by Steinberg are mesmerizing. For example, try 
closing your eyes and listening to Murrow describing one of the night bombing 
missions he flew over Berlin ("The small incendiaries were going down like a 
fistful of white rice thrown on a piece of black velvet"). 
</P>
<P>
Actually, his postwar TV career became white rice against black velvet -- from 
when he and producer Fred Friendly literally learned on the job while making 
"See It Now," a powerful commentary on social issues, to his contributions to 
"Harvest of Shame," the landmark 1959 documentary about the plight of migrant 
farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
It was "See It Now" that perhaps first dramatically showed the power of TV by 
forcing the reinstatement of an Air Force man unjustly discharged on grounds 
that his father and sister were Communist sympathizers. And later it was 
Murrow's most famous "See It Now" program -- an indictment of Joseph McCarthy 
-- that accelerated the decline of the Senate's infamous Red-hunting demagogue. 
Although Murrow was not the first to publicly rebuke McCarthy, this 1954 
program was an extremely courageous gamble given the Communist paranoia and 
blacklisting of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's hour ends with Murrow nearing a collision with CBS management, in 
part because of controversy generated by his McCarthy program. He left CBS in 
1961 to become head of the U.S. Information Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it's not for "See It Now" that Murrow is probably best remembered 
by the general public, but for "Person to Person," the breezy interview series 
that he hosted on CBS from 1953 to 1959. He would sit in the studio before a 
screen on which celebrities would give him tours of their homes. "That was 
innovative," Barbara Walters declares in the second installment. Like some of 
Walters' celebrity interviews, it was also empty. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there is no consensus here on just how Murrow reconciled the 
harmless hokum of "Person to Person" with his serious intent as a journalist. 
Almost paradoxically, though, Steinberg does provide evidence of his 
disillusionment with the medium that made him as famous as the stars he 
interviewed. Television, he bitterly charged in a 1958 speech, is "decadence, 
escapism and isolation from the realities of the world in which we live." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Moyers, who personifies the very best of TV journalism in the post-Murrow 
era, says here that Murrow once cynically warned him about the industry's 
management hucksters: "Sooner or later, they'll get you." 
</P>
<P>
If Murrow were alive today, he might think "they" got just about everyone and 
everything. When it was determined that TV news could be an important profit 
center, "they" decided it was too important to leave in the hands of 
newspeople. Hence the TV news age of choreographers and manipulators, resulting 
in a business almost totally driven by technology, pictures and personalities 
which, in turn, drive the minds of viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed hired people for not how they spoke, but for what they said," Hottelet 
recalls tonight. People like Sevareid and Shirer, with whom Murrow later had a 
falling out, are evidence of that. 
</P>
<P>
Now the wheel has turned, not only in the most obvious place -- the expanding 
circus in most of local news -- but also at the networks themselves, where news 
seems to be every bit the flaming holocaust that Murrow described from London. 
</P>
<P>
At NBC, for example, Tom Brokaw frequently hits the road not for journalistic 
reasons -- no matter what the network says -- but solely to get viewers to 
notice him. And the best and brightest that the news division now has to offer 
-- so it seems from the way they're constantly promoted on the air and given 
prime-time documentaries to front -- are Jane Pauley and Deborah Norville. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the occasional scintillating piece on "60 Minutes," whose executive 
producer, Don Hewitt, once worked at Murrow's side, the "See It Now" tradition 
is long dead. And so is the tradition of the commercial TV documentary meant to 
do more than divert or entertain. 
</P>
<P>
"My first exposure to Murrow was when I was 10 or 11," Steinberg said on the 
phone. "I had seen 'Harvest of Shame,' and it stayed with me forever." So she 
decided to end her documentary with footage of it being viewed this year by 
students of Edward R. Murrow High School in inner-city Brooklyn. Based on their 
reactions on the screen, the kids were deeply affected. 
</P>
<P>
With TV news increasingly becoming the province of corporate, sales and show 
people, such risk-taking documentaries haven't been made in years. And the 
television that Murrow called "the biggest classroom in the world" is now what 
David Halberstam tonight calls "the greatest cash register in the world." 
</P>
<P>
This . . . is Hollywood.

PHOTOGRAPHY: A SMALL MUSEUM IS THE FINAL DESTINATION OF THE TOURING EXHIBIT 
THAT HAS AROUSED BITTER CONTROVERSY AND A MAJOR POLITICAL ROW.

<P>
The Institute of Contemporary Art is small by most museum standards. 
Technically it isn't a museum at all, since it doesn't have a permanent 
collection. It's located in the Back Bay section of town, adjacent to a 
brownstone firehouse that was once a police station. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the institute's gallery space is in shambles as it prepares for a 
new show. The place is a clutter of letters and paint buckets, exposed 
electrical outlets and barrels of litter. Still on the walls are remnants of 
"Diamonds Are Forever," a show dedicated to stylish baseball memorabilia. But 
there won't be many Little Leaguers at the next exhibit, which opens Wednesday. 
It's titled "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment." 
</P>
<P>
Boston is the final destination of a seven-city tour that has aroused bitter 
controversy and a major political row in Washington. In the balance hangs 
artistic freedom and even the very existence of the National Endowment for the 
Arts. And worse, the last institution to house the Mapplethorpe show -- in 
Cincinnati -- now has its director facing a trial on misdemeanor obscenity 
charges. Yet the Cincinnati Contemporary Art Center attracted the largest 
attendance in its history for the Mapplethorpe photographs. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is sure: the ICA and its director, David Ross, are on the right side 
of the law in Boston. On July 3, Massachusetts Atty. Gen. James Shannon was 
asked by a reporter whether the Mapplethorpe show was obscene and he opined, 
after viewing a catalogue of the show, that it wasn't. Shannon's official 
declaration effectively precluded any prosecution by zealous local officials. 
During the first week of July, a private group also asked Mayor Raymond Flynn 
to cancel the show. The group calling itself the Catholic League for Religious 
and Civil Rights charged that the ICA was housed in a city-owned building. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bruce Rossley, commissioner for the mayor's office of arts and 
humanities, denies that the building belongs to the city, and adds that no 
taxpayer money -- even for police -- will be used in the Mapplethorpe exhibit. 
(Rossley added, for the record, that Mayor Flynn will not attend the show.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite having the upper hand, the ICA's director believes that the 
Mapplethorpe exhibition has been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"The big lie of the radical right is that this exhibition is homosexual 
pornography and pedophilic pornography," said Ross. "It's been told so many 
times that, like all the big lies in history, it's begun to take place as a 
truism. It's not even a debated issue among people of a broad range of 
intellectual and ideological backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit organizers may still have to face a battle from the state legislature. 
With the Mapplethorpe show and the controversial photographs of Andres Serrano 
(whose photograph of a crucifix dipped in a glass of urine sparked earlier 
local protests) in mind, the Massachusetts House of Representatives passed a 
last-minute amendment to bar state funds to any institution that displays 
artwork that is "offensive" to a religious group or depicts the sexual 
exploitation of children. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation written by Rep. Thomas Finneran (D-Dorchester) was passed by a 
2 to 1 margin in a late-night vote on May 22. It is currently bottled up in 
conference with the state Senate, which defeated the measure. Finneran's 
legislative aide, John Regan, said, "I venture to say this will not be a high 
priority" at ongoing conference sessions. 
</P>
<P>
In the Boston City Council, conservative councilman James Kelly wrote an open 
letter to Mayor Flynn declaring that the Mapplethorpe photographs are designed 
"to stir the minds of pedophiles." Kelly asked that the directors of the ICA be 
charged with violations of the child pornography laws if they don't comply with 
police demands to remove the photographs of nude children. So far, the mayor 
has not responded, but a spokesman from the attorney general's office said that 
the photos violate child pornography laws only if they are "lewd and 
lascivious" and that the attorney general doesn't believe these photographs 
are. 
</P>
<P>
Even moral support for the opponents of the Mapplethorpe show -- who say they 
"want the same thing to happen in Boston as in Cincinnati" -- has been lagging. 
The archdiocese newspaper, the Pilot, condemned the exhibition but acknowledged 
Mapplethorpe's artistic abilities. Even the conservative Murdoch-owned tabloid, 
the Boston Herald, long the champion for conservative causes, wrote an 
editorial on July 10 that stated "No one -- repeat -- no one is going to take 
people by the hand and force them into Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art. 
No one is going to impress innocent bystanders." 
</P>
<P>
And recently, eight managers and directors from Boston's oldest and largest 
arts institutions wrote to "affirm our support for the Institute of 
Contemporary Art." 
</P>
<P>
With their legal strategies blocked, opponents of the Mapplethorpe show only 
have acts of civil disobedience and vocal demonstrations left in their arsenal. 
Already there have been arrests at the Robert Klein Gallery, located near 
Boston's South Station where Serrano's "Piss Christ" was on display. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Murphy, assistant director at the gallery, said that she was present on 
June 19 when "five individuals came into the gallery and stood in front of 
'Piss Christ' with their rosary beads and stood there silently and prayed. They 
wouldn't speak to me. At the end of the day they went home. But they were 
standing directly in front of the photograph. On Wednesday, three people came 
back and again were standing in front of the photographs. They were trespassing 
and Robert (Klein) called the police to have them removed. They didn't 
acknowledge the policemen and they ended up being arrested. But we didn't press 
charges." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters failed to identify any group affiliations.

UNDISCLOSED GRANTS FOR ARTS RAISE ISSUE OF FAVORITISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are public grants awarded by the much-heralded Los Angeles Endowment for the 
Arts subject to private political pressures, either real or imagined? 
</P>
<P>
That unfortunate question surfaced Saturday, when documents obtained by The 
Times showed that $352,000 in previously undisclosed discretionary grants had 
been awarded to 32 area organizations by the city's Cultural Affairs 
Department. By far the largest of these awards -- $50,000 -- was made to a 
museum whose regular application had been turned down for funding by a duly 
appointed peer-review panel, but whose board of trustees includes a prominent 
city councilman. The undisclosed grant was also for substantially more money 
than any award made by the peer-review committee. 
</P>
<P>
Misconduct has been adamantly denied. The Cultural Affairs Department has 
explained that a late-term increase in its budget, received long after regular 
applications had been reviewed by review panels, made additional funds 
unexpectedly available for awards. Department staff, reportedly responding to a 
request from the City Council, decided to distribute those funds to a variety 
of organizations, including unsuccessful applicants, chosen by themselves and 
by City Council recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
These discretionary grants may well have been made with perfectly benign 
intent. Heaven knows, there are dozens of worthy cultural organizations that 
desperately need the money. And from the list of both peer panel and 
discretionary grants I've seen, the unusual $50,000 grant at issue is for a 
program of the very highest merit, both in its own right and in comparison to 
those the panel did recommend for funding. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the episode leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. The reason is that even 
the appearance of cronyism jeopardizes the integrity of the new Los Angeles 
Endowment for the Arts and of the system of peer-panel review that is its very 
lifeblood. 
</P>
<P>
Peer-panel review means an independent jury of peers selects grant recipients 
on the basis of disinterested evaluations of merit. Cultural Affairs Department 
staff obviously cannot be regarded as impartial observers; nor could the City 
Council or any other political office. Like my own impression of the relative 
merits of specific grant recipients and rejects, their opinions are largely 
academic -- and ought to remain that way. 
</P>
<P>
The July 11 announcement of peer-panel awards came at a crucial moment in the 
cultural life of the nation. The peer-panel system is at the center of the 
political assault on the National Endowment for the Arts. Chairman John E. 
Frohnmayer's cancellation of grants awarded by peer-review to four 
controversial performance artists is widely seen as an appalling capitulation 
to the endowment's political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the situation would seem to be quite different. At first 
glance, it appears grants are being distributed more widely, not withheld. But 
distributed to whom? Discretionary grants are not, after all, given to 
everyone; ipso facto they're "withheld" from some. 
</P>
<P>
The important question is: Who is doing the giving and withholding? A jury of 
artistic peers? Or politicians and insiders? 
</P>
<P>
In the past, arts grants administered by the Cultural Affairs Department were 
widely perceived in the visual arts community to be a joke. With panel 
recommendations regularly ignored, the department's grant allocation was 
commonly regarded as a fund for councilmanic districts, all under the 
unassailable guise of cultural beneficence. 
</P>
<P>
But the July 11 press conference announcing recipients of the L.A. Endowment 
peer-panel awards, at which Mayor Tom Bradley loudly blasted political 
interference in the NEA's system of peer-panel review, signaled something 
unusual. Clearly, the outcry over the political manipulation of the national 
endowment was being used to assert and bolster the necessary independence of 
the youthful local program. Things appeared to be looking up. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they're looking out of whack. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Los Angeles Endowment is in its infancy, unforeseen hazards should 
be expected to arise. And only time brings experience. Refinements of procedure 
ought to develop out of practice rather than theory. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it now seems silly to have big, internationally known institutions 
like the Museum of Contemporary Art competing head-to-head for exhibition funds 
with, say, the Boys and Girls Club of Venice, as was common in the current 
round of grant deliberations. It's apples and oranges. 
</P>
<P>
And because independent peer-review is crucial to the process, it is important 
that, in the future, panelists be drawn from outside Los Angeles as well as 
from within. The breadth of informed decision-making should be maximized, 
parochialism minimized. 
</P>
<P>
In the resolution of these and other issues more than one solution may be 
appropriate. In its happy dilemma over unexpected surplus funds, doling out 
discretionary grants was not the only resolution available to the Cultural 
Affairs Department. An emergency peer panel -- composed, say, from the chairmen 
of those that did the initial review of applications -- could have been 
convened to figure out what to do. Or, each organizational recipient of a 
peer-panel grant could have been given an unrestricted windfall, based on a 
percentage of its individual grant equal to the ratio of surplus funds to total 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, still other solutions existed. But the one chosen was inapt. 
</P>
<P>
A disinterested rather than discretionary method should have been found. 
Discretionary grants open wide the door to favoritism. If indeed the city has a 
legitimate interest in geographic distribution of its cultural funds, or in the 
health and welfare of this or that specific institution, then clear and 
accountable structures for addressing those aims need to be developed. Ad hoc 
handouts just won't do.

KNBC ADMITS FACE-CREAM REPORT 'MISTAKE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LEE MARGULIES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KNBC Channel 4 has acknowledged that a news report it broadcast about a 
cosmetic cream whose manufacturer says it can remove facial wrinkles failed to 
note that one of the users seen offering positive comments about the product 
was the president of the company that makes it. 
</P>
<P>
After inquiries from The Times, KNBC News Director Nancy Valenta said that "we 
made a mistake" in the July 10 report by medical reporter Dr. Bruce Hensel. 
</P>
<P>
Management had not previously known of the error, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hensel appeared on the 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts Friday with a 
"clarification," advising viewers that a man who had extolled the benefits of 
the product in an interview, Jim Wood, "is the president of ImmuDyne, 
manufacturer of the wrinkle cream NAYAD -- a point I failed to mention." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to clear up what he called "possible misunderstanding about the 
use of NAYAD," Hensel also said on the air Friday that state health officials 
are concerned that if NAYAD is used in conjunction with Retin-A, a medically 
approved wrinkle cream, "it could produce a toxic effect." 
</P>
<P>
Hensel, an associate professor of medicine at UCLA, had said flatly in his 
original report that the two products could be used together, even though he 
noted then -- and reiterated Friday -- that there have been no controlled 
studies done on the safety or effectiveness of NAYAD.

<CORRECTION>
<P>
FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Affiliations clarified -- Because of mistakes in biographical material supplied 
by KNBC Channel 4, articles in Calendar last Saturday and Monday incorrectly 
stated Dr. Bruce Hensel's affiliations with UCLA and Century City Hospital. 
Rather than a tenured professor, Hensel is an assistant clinical professor at 
the UCLA School of Medicine, an unpaid position that allows him participation 
in some areas of the teaching process. Hensel serves as co-director of the 
Century City Hospital Emergency Department, sharing the responsibility for 
overseeing the emergency ward on a part-time basis with two other doctors. A 
KNBC spokeswoman blamed the errors on the station's public relations 
department, which wrote Hensel's three-page biography. She said that Hensel, 
who has served as a medical reporter at Channel 4 since 1987, was hired by the 
station before he secured either the UCLA or Century City affiliations.

COUNTERPUNCH: ENDANGERED SPECIES: STRONG BLACK ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB JOHNSON, Johnson is president of the Black Entertainment Network. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We already know that the black male is an endangered species in American 
society. As the troubling statistics released at the recent NAACP convention 
point out, one in four black men is incarcerated or on probation or parole; the 
murder rate for black males is 10 times that for white males; black males are 
the only demographic group in the United States that can expect to live shorter 
lives in 1990 than they did in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The black male is also an endangered species in Hollywood ("Few Blacks Ever 
Reach the Studio Front Office," by David J. Fox, July 10). 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that the people who make programming decisions, and who produce 
and write programming, are a very small group. It's a select club of people. 
And it hasn't been opened up to ethnic diversity as much as it should be. These 
people write from their experiences, or what they know about, and they don't 
write things that they might be uncomfortable with or are indifferent to. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout film, television and video, the black male is shown to be, by my 
definition, non-threatening. Even though he may be a villain, the villain knows 
that the power is arrayed against him, and he will be brought to justice or 
killed. If he is a comedian, even though he may have power, he is basically 
still in a comedy role in terms of exercising that power. If he is a buddy or a 
sidekick, he may also be in a position to threaten whites, but only as a buddy, 
sanctioned by his white counterpart, not as an individual avenger. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases where the black has been cast as a primary dominant character in 
a threatening role, those shows have never survived television. You could say 
that the audience killed the programming. But I would argue that this type of 
programming is never given as much of an opportunity to succeed as other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Cop shows, for example, have been a television staple for a very long time, and 
many white cop shows or shows where whites are law-enforcement officials have 
been tried and failed and brought back again and again until they succeed. This 
does not happen with black shows. They don't get the number of times at bat and 
they also don't get the better time slots ("TV's Shame: Lack of Dramas on Black 
Life," by Rick Du Brow, June 6). 
</P>
<P>
The impact on real-life society is tragic. Because blacks are the largest users 
of TV and heavy users of film and video programs, this paucity reinforces the 
lack of dominant or positive black male role models. So what you have is young 
black kids going to movies and seeing no blacks in leadership roles. The 
consequence is that blacks seem to not have any kind of direct guidance for 
male roles other than what they get from television, and in most cases the 
black male is either weak -- as a comedian -- or he is put in a situation of 
being a criminal, so he can be exterminated by the powerful authorities who 
happen to be white, or he is put in the position of a buddy, which means he is 
controlled and consequently non-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
This can only be remedied by opening up to blacks the doors of the writing pool 
and the ranks of people who can "say yes" to what gets on screen. 
</P>
<P>
We need more people who see the black male as an integral part of society. To 
do that, you have to have more blacks as an integral part of television 
production. If that's not going to happen -- for economic reasons or because 
you can't change people's attitudes -- then I think blacks have to take over 
their own destinies, create their own images, and project those images to their 
own population. 
</P>
<P>
There are blacks who control billion-dollar economies in cities and blacks who 
control the armed might of the U.S. government. Gen. Colin L. Powell is 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and William H. Gray III is House 
majority whip. There are black mayors such as Tom Bradley. Why aren't we 
putting these people in powerful, dynamic roles in our films? 
</P>
<P>
I don't think you can lay at Hollywood's feet all of the problems and ills 
plaguing black society. Hollywood is just a microcosm of the whole society. 
There's racism in Hollywood just as there is racism in the shoe industry. But 
Hollywood should come under closer scrutiny, because it is a powerful purveyor 
of ideas and images. And in any society where images are projected against the 
body politic, there is an impact on attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood cannot escape the facts. Some may say that films are purely artistic 
endeavors with no meaning and no basis in reality. But the fact of the matter 
is that everything we do comes out of our experience, and everything in our 
experience affects attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States today, I see racial separation increasing, not decreasing, 
and racial polarization increasing. I don't think we're advancing. At best 
we're running in place, and at worst, we're moving backward.

COUNTERPUNCH: THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF BOTTLES FOR OLD WINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BUSHNELL, Bushnell is artistic director of the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sylvie Drake's review of recent productions of Henrik Ibsen's "The Wild Duck" 
at the Los Angeles Theatre Center (July 13) and of William Inge's "Bus Stop" at 
the Pasadena Playhouse (July 17) raise the perennial issue of directorial 
license in the production of "classic" plays and the even broader issue of 
"realism" as an aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
In reviewing "The Wild Duck," Drake notes that the production makes use of a 
set designed for "effect rather than functionality" and complains that the 
resulting spatial arrangement "parts company with sense." With puzzling logic, 
she also asserts that the production treats the play with "no embellishments, 
no untoward fuss," an approach she disarmingly suggests "should be a plus in a 
well-made play. . . ." Her clear bias toward realism and period fidelity is 
evident. 
</P>
<P>
In her review of "Bus Stop," she singles out the "period perfect" set for 
praise and rhapsodizes over its "full appointments . . . a telephone pole and 
patch of sky above the roof, softly falling snow and evidence of gale-force 
winds rattling the diner door." 
</P>
<P>
The attractions of such full-blown realism (to producers as well as critics) 
are beyond question, but the history of the modern stage production may be read 
as the record of the attempt to subvert, explode, transform, demystify and even 
banish such conventions -- ironically, the product of an aesthetic Ibsen 
himself helped to institute. Theater artists now know, at the end of nearly a 
century of anti-realist experimentation, that there are many kinds of bottles 
for old wine. 
</P>
<P>
If, in the LATC production of "The Wild Duck," an obviously non-realistic or 
impressionistic set was used, then the aim must not have been to settle for 
realistic "sense," but to undermine, or play with, that very demand. One cannot 
criticize the production for failing to attain a standard it clearly did not 
strive for. 
</P>
<P>
A more responsible (and responsive) review might have addressed the 
production's unusual deployment of actors in space (a space created by the 
"effect" of the set) in terms of the impact of this deployment on the play's 
action and meaning. If the set looks like "a furnished landing strip," at some 
point, so be it. The question is one of intent. What was the director, an 
experienced and renown theater artist, after? 
</P>
<P>
But Drake was unfortunately content to assume that productions of "The Wild 
Duck" are best served by conventional realism. No wonder she was disappointed 
when the production did not unilaterally comply with her expectation. 
</P>
<P>
There were other troubling aspects of her review. She complains that Ron 
Campbell is "pretty much wasted" in his "minor role" as a drunken theologian. 
Is she suggesting that gifted actors should not play minor roles or that 
Ibsen's smaller parts are unworthy of a director's best efforts in casting and 
staging? It is excusable to want to see as much of Ron Campbell as possible, 
but productions, like football teams, are best served with talent at every 
position. 
</P>
<P>
The review also complains that "director (Stein) Winge never quite got a handle 
on his Victorian countrymen." These Victorian countrymen exist, of course, only 
as words on the page, and they can be embodied only in the present for the 
present. The past itself is unknowable. 
</P>
<P>
The staging of a classic is always stretched between two poles of 
representation: the conventions and practices of the era that gave the play 
birth, and those of the era in which it is revived. The tension is usually 
invigorating and provides a reason to see the classics restaged in the first 
place. The director may emphasize the "pastness" of a classic, if he so 
chooses, or he may bring the work crashingly into the present; but either 
approach is purely interpretive. There are no "Victorian countrymen" to get a 
handle on, only a sketchy framework of theatrical conventions embedded in the 
text. To move beyond this framework, or even to make sense of it, is the task 
of the director, and his recourse must be to his imagination, not some 
nonexistent standard for the behavior of Victorian Norwegians. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the review asserts that the "ideas in the play are fascinating, but 
dated." Besides the fact that "dated" and "fascinating" would seem to be 
mutually exclusive, one must wonder exactly which ideas Drake finds too 
irrelevant. Is it teen suicide brought about by a combination of idealism and 
parental rejection? Is it Ibsen's condemnation of the power of greed? Is it his 
analysis of marriage? Is it the notion of an ideological zealot interfering, to 
tragic effect, in the personal lives of others? Ibsen's theatrical conventions 
are certainly not timely -- classics are always dated in that sense -- but it 
is hard to defend (and Drake doesn't) the notion that Ibsen's ideas have lost 
their currency. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism is a difficult trade, and Sylvie Drake is one of our most experienced 
reviewers, but L.A.'s theaters struggle in difficult and unsettling times and 
deserve more than unexamined assumptions and careless reasoning.

COUNTERPUNCH: MEEK BROADCASTERS HELP FCC OVERSTEP ITS BOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF POLLACK, Pollack is chief executive officer of Pollack Media Group, an 
international media consulting firm.

<TEXT>
<P>
The FCC's passing of a 24-hour indecency ban on radio, giving the commission 
the right to interpret what is decent or indecent material without regard to 
the differences in mores from city to city ("FCC Upholds 24-Hour-a-Day Ban on 
'Indecent' Broadcasts," July 13), is the latest in a series of setbacks for a 
country admired around the world for our history of allowing creative and 
artistic freedom to flourish. As new freedoms are embraced in Eastern Europe 
and the U.S.S.R., a chill wind is sweeping across the U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
Americans take our freedoms, the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press 
in particular, for granted, which is why this latest setback has occurred. The 
latest ruling by the FCC to ban "indecency" on radio 24 hours a day can be 
directly attributed to the meek response by broadcasters and the ineffective 
lobbying efforts of their representative organization, the National Assn. of 
Broadcasters, to last year's fining of 12 radio stations by the commission. 
Encouraged by their submissive reaction, the FCC has now taken a further step 
in its bid to become national interpreters of what is acceptable on American 
airwaves -- even as the case is still pending in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Today's electronic press is under siege, confronted by a commission that is 
once again overstepping its bounds in trying to act as parents for millions of 
America's children. This attempt to dictate acceptable public entertainment, 
never an FCC brief, is interfering in an area that is strictly a community and 
family affair. 
</P>
<P>
Children simply cannot be protected from the potentially harmful external 
influences facing them every day at home, in schools, from their friends or on 
radio and TV unless the parents have established the kind of relationship with 
their children that allows them to teach the difference between right and 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the FCC ruling is symptomatic of a government that increasingly 
accedes more to the wishes of the vocal minority than to the silent majority. 
If millions of people listen and enjoy controversial radio personalities, a few 
hundred letters should not constitute grounds for the FCC to scrutinize and 
fine radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, civil libertarians everywhere have decried the incoherent and 
vague indecency fines leveled by the FCC, but the talk has been cheap. Standing 
on the sidelines hoping this hysterical McCarthyism will go away plays into the 
hands of the headline-grabbing groups and elected officials who assume that an 
attack unchallenged is an attack agreed to. So, if we believe that the FCC 
fining some "dirty" deejays and "indecent" stations isn't a part of the grander 
scheme to control and edit what music, art, film and other entertainment is 
made available to Americans, we haven't been paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
Radio stations should not pay fines, but instead should challenge the FCC in 
court to prove that they have aired "indecent" content. Any officials and 
businesses that attempt to censor or muzzle creativity and the inherent right 
of Americans to the freedom of expression should be singled out and held 
accountable. 
</P>
<P>
America is a country based on diversity, not conformity. If you don't like it, 
don't listen to it or watch it. But don't restrict anyone else from choosing 
for themselves.

LIBERIANS MASSACRE 600;

MONROVIA, Liberia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an outburst of tribal killing, government troops today broke into a refugee 
camp in Monrovia and massacred about 600 people, many of them women and 
children, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The government denied responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
One witness who visited the Lutheran Church compound in the Sinkor district of 
the beleaguered capital said he saw women with their heads smashed open or 
blown to pieces by bullets, babies still tied to their backs. 
</P>
<P>
Bodies of other people were hanging from the window frames of the church 
building, apparently killed while trying to escape, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw dead bodies all around," the source said. "This is genocide." He spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees at a Methodist church across the street fled when they heard the 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of refugees fleeing the civil war between rebel forces and the 
crumbling government of President Samuel K. Doe are crowded into refugee camps 
in the area. Their numbers have swelled recently as rebel troops have stormed 
into Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
The witnesses said soldiers broke into the church compound at about 2 a.m. when 
the refugees were asleep. There was no telephone in the compound, so the 
victims had no way of calling for help. 
</P>
<P>
Most refugees are members of the Gio and Mano tribes, which form the main 
support for the rebels. Most of Doe's troops are from his Krahn tribe and the 
Mandingo tribe. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees sought protection at the church at the end of May after government 
soldiers attacked them at U.N. headquarters in Monrovia. The soldiers killed an 
unarmed security guard and abducted about 30 men. Many of their bodies were 
later discovered on the outskirts of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar withdrew all U.N. staff from 
Liberia in protest, halting an emergency program to aid war refugees. The U.N. 
chief said in New York that he reacted "with horror and dismay" to today's 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
The White House condemned the massacre as a "senseless act of terror." But it 
said the United States was not about to send in any troops. "At this point we 
don't believe that would be a prudent course of action," White House Deputy 
Press Secretary Steven Hart told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
As street battles raged in downtown Monrovia, rebel leader Prince Johnson 
seemed more preoccupied with his power struggle with a rival leader than with 
victory over Doe. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson told two Western photographers Sunday that the rival rebel leader, 
Charles Taylor, is "a criminal and a rogue." 
</P>
<P>
"He contacted Libya to bring communism here, and Moammar Kadafi gave him $8 
million to stage the Liberian revolution," Johnson alleged as he met the 
photographers in a small cafe in a Monrovia suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has consistently denied reports he received aid from Kadafi and claims 
to be a die-hard capitalist.

RAY BUCKEY TO SUE HIS ACCUSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer for Ray Buckey said the 32-year-old former teacher at the McMartin 
Pre-School intends to sue police and parents of former McMartin students as 
soon as a judge disposes of the eight undecided molestation charges filed 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
"To have this young man in jail for five years with no bail is very sad. . . . 
It has to be corrected," said Buckey's lawyer, James Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-year-old criminal case could come to an end Wednesday when the charges 
against Buckey are expected to be formally dismissed. On Friday, a Superior 
Court jury deadlocked on eight counts lodged against Buckey, and prosecutors 
said they would not seek a new trial. Buckey had been cleared by a previous 
jury on 40 other molestation counts. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Buckey's suit will be tacked onto lawsuits already filed by Buckey's 
mother, grandmother and sister.

3 KILLED AFTER BIG RIG OVERTURNS ON GOLDEN STATE IN BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three people died this morning when a tractor-trailer traveling southbound on 
the Golden State Freeway in Burbank overturned, causing a multivehicle crash, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred just north of the freeway's Verdugo Road exit about 10:40 
a.m., California Highway Patrol Officer Monty Keifer said. 
</P>
<P>
Police closed the roadway to traffic going both ways until 11:20 a.m., when 
they opened the northbound lanes. The southbound lanes were not expected to be 
reopened until at least 3 p.m., Keifer said. 
</P>
<P>
The two-trailer truck was carrying tomatoes when it overturned, Keifer said. A 
motor home traveling southbound also became involved in the accident, bursting 
into flames, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keifer said he suspected that additional vehicles were involved in the crash. 
He said he did not know the identities of the three who died, which vehicles 
they were traveling in, or whether additional people were injured or killed. 
</P>
<P>
At least 100 gallons of diesel fuel leaked from the truck's tanks, Keifer said, 
prompting the CHP to dispatch a hazardous materials cleanup team. The CHP has 
also begun a special investigation because of the high number of fatalities in 
the crash, Keifer said.

6 OVERCOME BY SULFURIC FUMES AT MITSUBISHI CYPRESS COMPLEX

Modeling clay used for making prototypes of new automobiles overheated in 
baking ovens and unleashed a noxious gas today that overcame six people at the 
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America complex in Cypress, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Four firefighters and two Mitsubishi employees were treated and released at Los 
Alamitos Medical Center after the 7 a.m. incident. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County fire officials evacuated more than 600 employees from the 
sprawling complex in the 6400 block of Katella Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Workers were not to be allowed back in until after hazardous materials response 
teams conducted air tests inside a Mitsubishi design studio where the gases 
were concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigation this morning found that the modeling clay was 
inadvertently left baking in industrial ovens in the design studio all weekend, 
resulting in the release of a sulfuric gas, Orange County Fire Department 
spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
Four Orange County firefighters who responded to the studio this morning on a 
report of smoke suffered dizziness and shortness of breath after being overcome 
by the gases as they entered the building. 
</P>
<P>
The two Mitsubishi employees, identified by fire officials as Dave O'Connell 
and Paul Sckluna, suffered the same symptoms after being among the first to 
report for work there this morning, Fire Department spokesman Dennis Shell 
said.

COOK SURVIVES 14 DAYS IN QUAKE RUBBLE;

PHILIPPINES: HE TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE BEFORE HIS RESCUERS FOUND HIM IN THE 
SHATTERED HOTEL.

<P>
A cook entombed for 14 days with corpses in the rubble of an 
earthquake-shattered hotel said he tried to kill himself before he was pulled 
from the rubble today. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I would not make it. I don't think I could have lasted one more 
day," said Pedrito Dy, 27, who survived two weeks without food by drinking his 
own urine and drips of rainwater. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to commit suicide several times by banging my head against the 
concrete beams because I could not take it any more," he told reporters before 
being flown to a hospital in Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Dy was the third survivor found in the last four days under the rubble of the 
Hyatt Terraces Hotel in Baguio, 120 miles north of Manila. A man and a woman 
entombed for 11 days in an elevator shaft of the hotel were rescued Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel was among dozens of buildings toppled by a strong earthquake that hit 
the northern Philippines on July 16, killing at least 1,650 people in Baguio 
and nearby provinces. 
</P>
<P>
"My pillows were the broken arms and the corpses of my dead companions," 
doctors at a Baguio hospital quoted Dy as saying after his rescue. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say this is a miracle because he had no food for two weeks and yet 
survived," said Rogelio Bay-an, a doctor at the Baguio General Hospital where 
Dy was being treated. 
</P>
<P>
Dy, who was suffering from dehydration and bruises, said he did not think any 
of the 60 or so people whom hotel officials believe are trapped in the ruins 
could be alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm the last person they would get alive from the hotel," Dy said. 
</P>
<P>
Dy, a cook who doubled as a body-building instructor at the hotel, said he was 
working out in a gym with 11 people in the hotel basement when the earthquake 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of his companions were killed immediately, and the two others died of 
injuries over the weekend just before rescue came. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly they (the two) stopped talking. It was then that I knew they were 
dead," Dy said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign rescue experts left Baguio a week ago saying there was no chance of 
finding anyone trapped in the ruins alive.

TEENS KILL GRANDMA ON BIRTHDAY

<P>
Two Belgian teen-agers murdered their grandmother on her birthday -- but it 
took them several attempts to do so, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
They first gave Solange Deval a present of chocolate eclairs laced with Valium, 
but she did not die. 
</P>
<P>
They then forced the 62-year-old woman to inhale tear gas from a small canister 
used by women to fend off attackers. But again she did not die. 
</P>
<P>
They finally killed her when they knocked her out with chloroform, beat her 
with a broom handle and strangled her, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Gravedigger Frans Mahau, the father of the pair, had confessed under 
questioning to plotting with his children to murder Deval at her home in the 
southern town of Charleroi on July 21, the spokesman said. "This was a family 
plot of the most macabre kind," he added.

EC PUSHES FARM SUBSIDIES CUT

The European Community made a surprise proposal today to break almost four 
years of deadlock in farm trade talks, challenging world trading partners to 
cut subsidies to farmers by 30% by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
Ray MacSharry, farm commissioner for the 12-nation EC, sprung the plan at a 
closed-door meeting of agriculture ministers from Australia, Canada, Japan and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has been at loggerheads with the EC over farm trade 
reform, appeared taken aback by MacSharry's proposal, which would take into 
account any subsidy cutbacks made since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter, who has called on the community to 
overhaul its agriculture policies, said Washington will not officially respond 
to the offer until it is formally made at world trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a negotiation," Yeutter said, referring to the meeting here. It 
had been billed as informal, and no dramatic initiatives were expected.

Eight months after suspending publication, Ms. magazine went back to the 
newsstand today without advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine also has a slightly new name, Ms.: The World of Women, which its 
backers say better reflects its worldwide scope. 
</P>
<P>
The first issue of the redesigned magazine is selling for $4.50 a copy. 
Subscriptions are $40 a year for six issues. 
</P>
<P>
The cover of the first issue shows a tiny globe nestled between two women's 
hands. "Collector's edition," it says across the top. "No advertising, 
editorially free. Ms. Lives." 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Ms. suspended publication after the November, 1989, issue. Its 
new owner is Dale Lang, who also publishes Working Woman, Working Mother, Sassy 
and Success magazines.

JAPANESE PRESS FOR RICE IMPORT

Japan should offer to liberalize its closed rice market before the scheduled 
end of global trade talks in December, a group of 20 top Japanese academics 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to play our own card on reform, because if the current talks on 
reforming farm trade fail to bear fruit, Japan's farm sector will receive a 
major blow," Yujiro Hayami, professor of international economics at Aoyama 
Gakuin University and chairman of the Forum for Policy Innovation, told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has come under heavy international criticism for its ban on all 
commercial imports of rice, which it defends on the ground that it must remain 
self-sufficient in the national staple grain for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The academics proposed that Japan start liberalizing by importing 200,000 tons, 
or 2% of its total annual demand, in 1992, and that this quota be increased by 
10% a year to 300,000 tons.

U.S. fast-food giant McDonald's unveiled plans today to open its first outlet 
in East Germany but found its global hamburger empire was not to everyone's 
taste. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and city politicians hostile to the move snuffed a planned 
blaze of publicity, ensuring that not a single Big Mac made it across the 
Berlin Wall to accompany the news. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a successful restaurant chain offering quality products, not some 
wandering snack bar," Walter Rettenwender, chairman of McDonald's Germany, said 
at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agreed. 
</P>
<P>
East Berlin's City Council refused permission for a mobile McDonald's burger 
stand in the Alexanderplatz, saying it wanted to cut down on street traders in 
its main square. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's canceled a five-star press reception in an East Berlin hotel, 
fearing disruption from ecologists who say the company is bad for health and 
the planet. 
</P>
<P>
Even plans to hand out burgers at the news conference went wrong. Journalists 
had smoked-salmon sandwiches instead.

SPIDER-MAN SNARES COMIC BOOK HONORS

Dick Tracy has a gang of funny-faced bad guys on the run in movie theaters and 
Bart Simpson rules television airwaves and T-shirt sales, but the summer 
belongs to Spider-Man for comic book fans. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two weeks after its release in June, the first issue of a new Marvel 
Comics series, titled simply "Spider-Man," became the best-selling comic in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
And the wisecracking web-slinger snared "favorite character" honors in the 
annual Comics Buyer's Guide readers poll. The wall-crawler defeated Batman, 
last summer's box office sensation and titleholder since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Spidey's success has Hollywood sniffing around for a movie deal. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes right down to it, I can be pretty awesome if I want," 
Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, said in an introspective moment in the 
first comic in the new series, "Spider-Man No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
He debuted in 1962 as an unpopular teen-ager whose life changed when he was 
bitten by a radioactive spider. Today, he's a graduate student in biophysics 
who shares a New York loft with his glamorous actress-model wife. 
</P>
<P>
"He's changing with the times, but still contains a lot of the stuff that 
attracted (people) to the character in the first place," said Spider-Man's 
editor, Jim Salicrup. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian cartoon artist Todd McFarlane, 29, gets much of the credit for the new 
comic book series' success. Previously, he drew for "Amazing Spider-Man," the 
title of the original comic book series. In 1988, he redesigned the costume to 
add a "creepier" feel. 
</P>
<P>
The new series' first run of 2.35 million copies sold out, so Marvel is 
printing another 400,000, said Pamela Rutt, a spokeswoman for the country's 
largest comic book publisher.

Sotheby's will sell Greta Garbo's art collection in its New York galleries in 
mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
The collection, estimated in excess of $20 million, includes major 
Impressionist and modern paintings, in addition to fine European furniture and 
decorative works of art. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the late actress' collection is a group of important 
Impressionist and modern paintings that will be offered during Sotheby's major 
evening sale Nov. 13. These paintings include three intimate scenes by Renoir: 
a tender portrait of the artist's nephew, Edmond, from 1889; "Gabrielle and 
Coco Lisant" from 1906, and "Confidence" from 1893. 
</P>
<P>
The Garbo collection is rounded out by a significant group of paintings by such 
20th-Century artists as Andre, Atlan, Van Dongen, d'Espagnat, Lhote, Poliakoff 
and Valtat, among others, which will be offered in conjunction with Part II of 
Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern paintings on Nov. 14.

Jerry Harrison, keyboardist and guitarist for Talking Heads, says the band is 
"officially in hibernation," but no one is resting. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, 41, said he had hoped Talking Heads would put out an album this year, 
but "I didn't get my way." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not through as a band, but we're not doing anything this year," he said 
in the Aug. 6 issue of People magazine. The band's last album, "Naked," was 
released in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison has another band, Casual Gods, which just released its third album, 
"Walk on Water," and is touring this summer with the Tom Tom Club, led by 
fellow Talking Heads members Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth. 
</P>
<P>
The other Talking Heads member, David Byrne, recently completed a concert tour.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES TYPICALLY COST LESS OUTSIDE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOE GRAEDON, AND TERESA GRAEDON

Question: When I was in Canada visiting my son, I ran out of my blood pressure 
medicine Dyazide. My son's physician was kind enough to write me a prescription 
for a month's supply. 
</P>
<P>
To my amazement, when I got the prescription filled, it cost only half as much 
as it would have at home. I specifically asked the pharmacist if this was a 
generic drug instead of the brand name, but she showed me the bottle of Dyazide 
she had used to fill it. She said that drugs are less expensive in Canada than 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Americans spend more for their medicines than virtually anyone else. We 
have received letters from people who have traveled to Mexico, Canada and a 
number of European countries and discovered that the drugs they were taking 
cost far more here. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign governments often control the prices of pharmaceutical products. This 
usually means their citizens pay 30% to 50% less. 
</P>
<P>
Next time you visit your son, you might want to consider stocking up. You can 
bring back up to three months' supply of your medication, but go equipped with 
a letter from your doctor and a signed statement of your own promising that the 
medicine is for your personal use. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I was alarmed when I read about how heat and humidity can wreck medicine. I 
do not have air-conditioning and the temperature has gone over 90 degrees this 
summer. Should I be keeping my pills in the refrigerator? 
</P>
<P>
A. Check with your pharmacist. The refrigerator is too cold for some 
medications and too humid for others. The pharmacist can check on storage 
requirements and tell you if the heat is likely to do your pills any harm. 
</P>
<P>
If he suggests you keep your medicine in the refrigerator, make sure your 
container is airtight so it can keep out moisture. If it has a child-proof cap, 
the container should be sealed in a plastic bag to protect the pills from 
humidity.

LIZ SMITH: GORDY TELLS HIS VERSION OF SUPREMES' BREAKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAST WEEK we told you about an upcoming book titled "All That Glittered: My 
Life With The Supremes" written by the late Florence Ballard's friend and fan, 
Tony Turner. This behind the scenes tell-all didn't have many nice things to 
say about Diana Ross and Berry Gordy Jr. and about Motown's efforts to control 
or silence the volatile and bitter Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
Now Gordy has given his first in-depth interview in 20 years to Rolling Stone, 
an issue due on newsstands Aug. 7. And in light of this latest bashing that he 
and Ross are about to endure, what Gordy has to say to Michael Goldberg about 
the breakup of the Supremes is very interesting indeed: 
</P>
<P>
"It had gotten to the point, as it does in so many groups, when there's a total 
miscommunication between the two factions. The ones in the background were 
having conflicts with the one in front. Diana never wanted to leave the girls, 
particularly. She was more or less pushed out, but that's what happens when a 
person is out front, and people are telling the background singers that she's 
stealing the show. . . . I made the choice who sang lead, and my opinion was 
always that Diana had the magic and Mary Wilson didn't. But Mary felt she 
should be the one, and I said no and favoritism was charged. And it was perhaps 
favoritism because Diana was a favorite of mine." 
</P>
<P>
It must be noted that Berry does not mention Ballard in his overview of the 
rise and fall of The Supremes. Perhaps that is just as well. They parted as 
enemies and Flo was never able to reconcile herself to the fact of Diana Ross's 
charisma, and that it was Ross's appeal that propelled the group to 
super-stardom. 
</P>
<P>
JOHN GOODMAN is possibly the busiest and most popular actor around right now. 
He's currently exterminating spiders in "Arachnophobia," just finished up 
Universal's "King Ralph I" in London and will soon return to the set of ABC's 
hit series "Roseanne" (that is, if his co-star Roseanne Barr, doesn't 
completely self-destruct). 
</P>
<P>
Now comes word that it will be John Goodman in an upcoming big-screen movie 
about the life of baseball legend Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Film and sports buffs may recall it won't be the first time Ruth's life has 
been given the Hollywood treatment. In 1948 William Bendix portrayed baseball's 
great star in "The Babe Ruth Story." 
</P>
<P>
KEVIN COSTNER is putting the final touches on his "Dances With The Wolves" 
epic, a film which he produced, directed and stars in. While doing this, and 
preparing for his Robin Hood role in "Prince of Thieves," he is mulling over an 
offer from Orion for a sequel to his big hit "Bull Durham."

Barrett, while pitching for the Boston Braves, set the record for the fewest 
pitches in a nine-inning game in 1944 when he faced 27 batters and threw only 
58 pitches in a 2-0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
He was voted the International League's most valuable player in 1942 and was 
named to the National League All-Star team in 1945. He pitched in the World 
Series for St. Louis in 1946 and for the Braves in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett, who died Saturday, also pitched for Cincinnati and compiled a career 
record of 69-69 with an ERA of 3.53.

In a baseball announced today, White Sox slugger Ron Kittle joined the 
Baltimore Orioles and right-handed outfielder Phil Bradley went to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is in the last year of his contract and is eligible for free agency at 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, hitting .270 with four home runs and 26 RBI, had expressed displeasure 
at the course of recent contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Kittle, a first baseman, both came to the major leagues in 1983, 
and Kittle was named rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley played with the Seattle Mariners from 1983 to '87 and spent one season 
with the Philadelphia Phillies before joining the Orioles in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Kittle played with the White Sox until he was traded to the New York Yankees 
during the 1986 season. He was sent to Cleveland in 1988 and rejoined Chicago 
as a free agent before the start of last season. 
</P>
<P>
Kittle is batting .245 with 43 RBI and a team-leading 16 home runs. He is 
fourth on the White Sox all-time home run list.

Two members of the West German show jumping team today ducked questions about 
their involvement in alleged cruelty to horses. 
</P>
<P>
German champion Otto Becker said he "was not allowed to comment" on the 
allegations against his employer, Paul Schockemohle, because of the police 
investigation into whether the three-time European champion had violated animal 
protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
Becker arrived in Stockholm for the Show Jumping World Championships that open 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The organizing Swedish Equestrian Federation has called for the withdrawal of 
Schockemohle as coach plus three nominated team members, including Becker. The 
move was triggered by the release this month in the German magazine, Stern, of 
a videotape showing Schockemohle hitting young horses legs' with a wooden stick 
over jumps. The method is banned in international competition and some 
countries, while allowed in others. 
</P>
<P>
After the footage was shown on German television, Schockemohle was reported to 
police for cruelty to animals and an investigation begun.

MELVIN DURSLAG: SHELL PUTS A TEAM WITH NO HOME BACK IN FAMILIAR TERRITORY

Coaching the Raiders requires a gift for detachment. 
</P>
<P>
The coach must, to begin with, detach himself from the litigations pervading 
the everyday life of the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
He must detach himself from contract problems involving the help, leaving these 
matters to a higher god. 
</P>
<P>
And where the team will be located is an issue with which he can't be 
concerned, either. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a final detachment connected with his job, it would be in the area 
of that style of football the Raiders choose to play. 
</P>
<P>
That decision, too, rests with a higher god. 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder Art Shell is delighted with his position as head coach of the 
Raiders, who have just landed in London for an exhibition next Sunday with the 
New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Art's mind needn't be clouded with detail. 
</P>
<P>
"I pay attention to injuries and to what happens on the field," Art says. "It 
is my job only to implement Raider football as we have known it over the 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Raider football was known for something not prevalent today. It 
was wins. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to rectify this distressing problem, management changed coaches in 
1988, bringing in a young gentleman from Denver named Mike Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
Erring in his belief that the Raiders belonged to him, he changed the offensive 
concept. He changed team rules; a Raider, for instance, no longer could grace 
the sideline sitting on his helmet. 
</P>
<P>
He also changed the coaching staff, attempting at one point to fire nine 
assistants. That represented a lot of assistants, considering the staff 
consisted of 11. 
</P>
<P>
Among those recommended for dismissal was Shell, an offensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Shanahan was permitted the luxury of four firings, after which 
ownership fired Shanahan, replacing him with Shell after the fourth game last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the offense introduced by Shanahan went out the door with him, the 
Raiders returning to the type of game they embraced through their happier 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Will you resort to the short passing game so popular today in the NFL?" Shell 
was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally," he answered, "our policy will be to look deep first and look short 
second. We favor what is called the horizontal game. We did an awful lot of 
winning with it." 
</P>
<P>
The horizontal game, of course, is the longtime choice of the team operator, Al 
Davis, who will tolerate change in the system, but not upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking upheaval, Shanahan came to his finish. Shell will be more discreet. 
</P>
<P>
Talking privately to Raider players about their coach, you get the feeling they 
like him in ways not related to tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"Having played for as long as he did (15 years)," says one, "he has a good 
understanding of guys' problems. And one of his best qualities is that he isn't 
petty. He pays attention only to important things. He doesn't pick at players 
and impose a lot of . . . rules." 
</P>
<P>
In the 12 games he coached last year, Shell won seven, handicapped throughout 
the season with player injuries. Coaching a total of 20 games with the Raiders, 
his predecessor, Shanahan, won only eight, leading to his departure. 
</P>
<P>
If he had done more winning, the changes he tried to introduce might have been 
acceptable. But ripping up an organization, and losing, is a combination few 
are able to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Shell feels blessed not having to deal with contract problems involving his 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came into pro football," he recalls, "my agent was my college president 
at Maryland State. He sat down with Al Davis and negotiated my initial 
contract. He asked no fee. Thereafter, I never had an agent, even when I became 
All-Pro." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you feel you were shorted?" he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all. I probably did better than I should have. I would say to Al Davis, 
'Al, you're my agent. You deal with yourself as if I were your client.' I 
always got what was coming to me. And I had far fewer headaches than players 
have today." 
</P>
<P>
Art thought about this for a moment, then continued: 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of agents create unhappiness among their players by making them believe 
they are worth more money than they ever will get. They are working on the 
players' egos. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they don't get the money the agents have suggested and they feel 
cheated. I never had the grief that players experience today." 
</P>
<P>
"Is it upsetting to you and your players not knowing whether the Raiders will 
be playing in L.A. next year, or even this year?" 
</P>
<P>
"I own a home here (in Palos Verdes) and I have children in school," he 
answered, "but those problems are standard in professional sports, as well as 
other businesses. If your company moves, you move with it. You survive, 
especially if you have a good job. I think the players are a little uneasy over 
their team's status, but not uneasy enough to play bad football. If we lose, in 
other words, we can't blame it on the moving plans of the club." 
</P>
<P>
Encamped in London, where they will meet the Saints at Wembley Stadium, the 
Raiders have brought over their dancing troupe, the Raiderettes, and will 
tender a helpful suggestion for the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
They will recommend Roseanne Barr to sing "God Save The Queen." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, folks wouldn't have been so upset if they had come to savor 
Roseanne's beauty, not her voice.

ENDANGERING A SPECIES OUR OWN;

<P>
THE ACT SHOULD BE AMENDED SO HUMAN WELFARE COMES FIRST.

<P>
If Shakespeare's Marc Antony were to examine the Endangered Species Act of 1973 
and the spotted owl contretemps, he would be compelled to reiterate from Julius 
Caesar's funeral oration: 
</P>
<P>
 O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts / And men have lost their reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The act propagates a pestiferous imbalance between the earthbound benefits of 
economic growth and human well-being, and the protection of endangered or 
threatened fish, wildlife and plants. Wholesale amendments are required to 
stand the public interest upright, as President Bush and Secretary of the 
Interior Manuel Lujan Jr. have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the act blocks any federal action, including leasing, 
selling or licensing, that might jeopardize the existence or critical habitats 
of endangered or threatened species. (A species is "endangered" if extinction 
is impending; it is "threatened" if extinction is likely in the foreseeable 
future.) 
</P>
<P>
But why should the nation shield endangered or threatened species en bloc from 
such valuable federal activities as the sale of timber, or of oil and gas 
leasing, or the licensing of hydroelectric projects? Concededly, Congress 
decreed that these species are invariably of "aesthetic, ecological, 
educational, historical, recreational, and of scientific value to the nation 
and its people." But a decree is no substitute for empiricism. 
</P>
<P>
Does the spotted owl possess aesthetic, educational, historic or scientific 
value in its natural habitat that could not be duplicated in captivity? What is 
the ecological benefit of the snail darter? Is every plant root or mollusk 
important to science or pleasure? What is the contribution of the red squirrel 
to ecological balance? These salient questions are foolishly unasked in the 
Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous species of fish, wildlife and plants in the United States perished 
before 1973 because of economic growth without ushering in the Four Horsemen of 
the Apocalypse. The act falsely postulates that, after 1973, the consequences 
of extinction would be disastrous; it erects an indomitable legal fortress 
around all endangered or threatened species, and it generally forecloses any 
inquiry into the benefits of protecting species in their natural habitats. 
</P>
<P>
The act robotically garlands endangered or threatened species in lieu of 
federally assisted economic or scientific activity -- even if also 
environmentally beneficial -- but for two thin exceptions: the secretary of the 
interior may consider economic impact in specifying the critical habitat of a 
threatened but not an endangered species, and a five-member majority of a 
seven-member endangered species committee may authorize an exemption from the 
act under super-strict conditions. Only one exemption has passed the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, tens of thousands of jobs are at stake, illustrated by the timber 
cutting curtailed by listing the spotted owl as a threatened species. Workers 
should not be insouciantly sacrificed for a handful of lyrical worshippers of 
pristine life who obtain visual delight from an occasional glimpse of the owl. 
California's Board of Forestry further insulted worker interests by slashing 
private timber production to exalt the spotted owl with no proof of its 
contribution to either ecology or science. 
</P>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act should be amended so that human welfare ordinarily 
is preferred to the welfare of lesser species. To overcome the presumption, it 
should demand hard proof that a particular endangered or threatened species 
brings aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational or 
scientific benefit in its natural habitat that clearly outweighs the economic, 
scientific, or environmental benefit of federal agency action. 
</P>
<P>
A reversal of the act's priorities is further justified by the primitive state 
of science used to identify a species as endangered or threatened. Thus, the 
snail darter was initially listed as endangered, but subsequent discoveries 
discredited the listing. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many federal actions that may adversely affect an endangered or 
threatened species are environmentally friendly. The construction of 
hydroelectric power dams reduces the danger of global warming, acid rain and 
air pollution. Oil and gas leases reduce the volume of tanker traffic in U.S. 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
Revising the Endangered Species Act to reflect a measured balancing of the 
competing ends of mankind would honor the banner of reason in Congress. As 
President Bush and Secretary Lujan recognize, much of contemporary 
environmentalism is nothing but nonsense on stilts.

THESE BEARS PREFER FISHING TO FIGHTING;

CREATING A NATURAL VIEWING ENVIRONMENT FOR VISITORS.

ON THE McNEIL RIVER, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's easy to fall into a sense of complacent security at the McNeil River 
Falls, even when surrounded by the scores of brown bears that come to feed 
during the salmon spawning runs each summer. 
</P>
<P>
Although bears and visitors mingle without barriers, the bears seem far more 
interested in having fish for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
But suddenly, the mood changes and the visitors find themselves facing several 
agitated bears, at arm's length. Some cubs have become separated from their 
mothers, and the sows are searching for their them -- all milling frantically 
around the open viewing ledges. 
</P>
<P>
The incident lasts less than a minute but reminds a visitor that he is dealing 
with creatures that could ruin his day. He is on their turf, at their mercy. 
</P>
<P>
That no visitor has suffered harm in the 18 years that the Alaska Department of 
Fish and Game has been conducting tours to the site is part of the wonder of 
McNeil. The spectacle, in a remote, treeless area of Kamishak Bay on the east 
coast of the upper Alaska Peninsula, is the greatest gathering of bears in 
North America, perhaps the world. 
</P>
<P>
During this day 71 were seen feeding within a 100-yard stretch. There were 50 
at one time. 
</P>
<P>
The bears concentrate at the one stretch of the river where the falls make the 
fish most vulnerable. Here they are called brown bears, although they are 
members of the same biological family -- Ursus arctus horribilis -- as the 
grizzly bears that reside inland. They aren't quite as large as the Kodiak 
bears on nearby Kodiak and Afognak Islands, which are the largest land 
carnivores in the world, but they are big enough. Males will grow to nine feet 
and more than 1,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
A bear is usually angered by violation of his personal space, which in his mind 
is considerable. When approaching blind turns in a trail, hikers are advised to 
make human sounds, such as hailing, "Hey, bear!" so the bear will have a chance 
to avoid a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
However, bears are curious. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one thing that gets them into trouble with people," says Larry 
Aumiller, who has been supervising the McNeil visits for 15 years. "It's part 
of their food-gathering behavior. They check out everything." 
</P>
<P>
The average bear doesn't want trouble and won't create trouble with the 
average, sensible tourist. But Aumiller says there are two types of bears: 
"Those that are habituated to humans and those that are not." 
</P>
<P>
The McNeil bears are habituated to humans, but only at McNeil. The arrangement 
works because Aumiller is careful not to overwhelm the bears with large numbers 
of visitors -- the daily limit is 10 -- or alarm them with unpredictable 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors can eat their lunches in peace because the bears, unlike the black 
bears at Yellowstone, have never been fed by man and don't associate people 
with handouts of food. Besides, they're more interested in fishing. 
</P>
<P>
However, all rules are off away from the falls. As they lead visitors through a 
tundra of alder bushes and wildflowers to and from the falls, Aumiller and his 
wife, Colleen, carry riot shotguns. They have never had to fire them, but . . . 
</P>
<P>
As the commotion settled down and the sows sorted out their cubs, Aumiller 
quietly reached for his weapon and advised Colleen to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"That's kind of unusual," he said of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Colleen Aumiller explained, the problem resulted from a spat 
between the two sows. They are fiercely protective of their cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"The one with two cubs got spooked by the other mother," she said. "The cubs 
freaked out and ran from the other bear." 
</P>
<P>
When the cubs found their way blocked by visitors, they stood up on their hind 
legs in confusion. One tried to run through a viewing area but Larry Aumiller 
grabbed a stool to block him, fearing a sow might follow, and inadvertently 
pushed him over a ledge. 
</P>
<P>
"Cubs are not afraid of people," Colleen Aumiller said. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, one sow returned downstream to resume her fishing, 
seemingly content but with only one of her two cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one thing we've learned about bears," Colleen Aumiller said. "They 
can't count." 
</P>
<P>
And cubs sometimes have difficulty identifying their mothers, although this one 
eventually found his way back. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Fish and Game receives almost 2,000 applications a year from those who 
want to visit McNeil. Only 140 permits are drawn, each good for four 
consecutive days. But because a third or more of the permit days aren't used, 
standbys have a good chance of getting in. 
</P>
<P>
That morning, Aumiller had checked in six permittees, meaning there were four 
spots left for standbys. He spread a deck of cards on a table in the cook cabin 
-- high cards win. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter drew the three of diamonds, but John Hechtel, a Fish and Game bear 
biologist from Anchorage who had drawn a better card, graciously offered his 
spot so as not to break up a group that had come by boat from the Chenik Brown 
Bear Camp the day before. 
</P>
<P>
Even Fish and Game employees get no special treatment at McNeil. Hechtel would 
go the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Aumiller timed the departure and return for low tide because the shortest route 
was across a tidal mudflat, where only a few bears fished. The party -- Larry 
Aumiller in front, Colleen in the rear, shotguns slung on their shoulders -- 
marched single-file, arriving at the falls in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
There were only 15 to 20 bears feeding through the early afternoon, but after 4 
the rush started until all the best fishing holes were taken. 
</P>
<P>
All brown bears do not look alike. Some are light brown, others dark brown, 
some a mix. Others are easily identifiable by old battle scars. Bears lock 
their jaws when fighting, and one at McNeil has a broken jaw that never set 
right. 
</P>
<P>
The Aumillers know all the adult bears by sight. They have logged and named 84 
as current regulars at McNeil, along with 42 cubs. 
</P>
<P>
There is a pecking order at McNeil. Groucho, a large, dark male, commands the 
prime site, sitting on his haunches all day in a small pool in mid-stream where 
salmon more than two feet long must pass his claws and jaws to get upstream. 
Lesser bears wait respectfully for the established bears, like Groucho, to 
catch and eat their fill. 
</P>
<P>
As a bear called Rusty approached his usual spot, another bear -- Cecil -- 
captured a large salmon in his claws and departed in the opposite direction, 
avoiding a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
The Aumillers are concerned about Rusty, who is probably in his mid-20s and 
past his prime. 
</P>
<P>
"He's losing weight," Colleen said, "and he may be losing his sight and 
hearing. Once he mistook Larry for a bear." 
</P>
<P>
Groucho was originally one of an obviously named trio, Harpo and Chico having 
long since disappeared to uncertain fates. Groucho might allow them to fish his 
site, but it is doubtful. Certainly, any other potential intruder arouses a 
rise to all fours and a hard, withering stare. Nobody challenges his claim. 
</P>
<P>
While the other bears retire fish-in-mouth to atop a nearby rock to feed or 
amble up the slopes to hide in the alders, Groucho eats his catch on the spot, 
secure in his status. He will consume 30 or more fish in a day. 
</P>
<P>
At the other extreme is Ted, the forlorn, fainthearted son of Teddy, who is 
something of a celebrity around McNeil. Teddy, with her light head and darker 
body, has been pictured on the dust covers of three books about bears and was 
most recently cover girl for National Wildlife magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"Teddy's our old favorite," Colleen Aumiller said. "She's so good and 
protective." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Aumiller told of a time a few years ago when he was tempted to break his 
own rule: never touch a bear. He had left the door of his cabin open to nab a 
bold squirrel that had been causing problems. Instead, Teddy started to walk 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"She had both front paws inside the door," Aumiller said. "I could have reached 
out and given her a pat on the head, but I just said, 'No bears allowed in 
here.' She slowly backed out. Ted was with her." 
</P>
<P>
Poor Ted probably hasn't caught a fish in his life, preferring to sneak up on 
other, smaller bears and steal their catches. When a large bear approaches, Ted 
heads the other way. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, among bears, the bigger bear rules, although behavior also is 
important -- if a bear is easily bluffed. Ted is easily bluffed, but he isn't 
the only one that is easily intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"They're continually testing one another," Aumiller said. "If one bear can get 
another to break and run, Bear One becomes dominant. It can change, depending 
on how hungry they are, but size is the main criterion. 
</P>
<P>
"Little guys have a heck of a time getting in there and getting a fish. Most of 
them are very nervous. They spend a lot of time looking (from the banks)." 
</P>
<P>
Fossey, a small sow barely larger than her two cubs, arrives at the top of the 
falls, stands and claps her paws to announce herself. 
</P>
<P>
"That's unique to her . . . a little show of aggression," Colleen Aumiller 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Fossey is named for the late Dian Fossey, the naturalist whose work with 
wildlife inspired her 1983 book and the motion picture, "Gorillas In the Mist." 
</P>
<P>
Fossey quickly catches a fish in her paws. "Now you're gonna see some carrying 
on, when the cubs get to her," Larry Aumiller says. 
</P>
<P>
Fossey races up the slope with her cubs in pursuit, and there is much growling 
and tugging for the catch. 
</P>
<P>
Another sow approaches from high on the opposite bank, but her tiny cub clings 
to her legs, holding her back. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen, mimicking the cub, says: "Hey, mom, look at all those bears down 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Each bear has his own style of fishing. Some younger, inexperienced ones thrash 
about. Others sit by the side and try to swat fish out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
Groucho sits motionless, then clutches with his claws in quick thrusts. Rusty 
grabs the fish that slip back from trying to climb the falls. Goggles arrives 
at 5:40, methodically studies the situation, then sits down in a large pool, as 
if settling onto a bar stool. 
</P>
<P>
One bear, unidentified, strolls into the pool until he's almost submerged, then 
dips his head underwater and "snorkles" for his fish. 
</P>
<P>
All seem oblivious to the visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hechtel, the state bear biologist: "This is the greatest place in the 
world for seeing bears. This is like the Vatican for me." 
</P>
<P>
The concentration of bears at McNeil was discovered in the 1950s, and as word 
spread -- assisted by an article in National Geographic -- unsupervised 
visitors came to watch, and incidents resulted in the killing of two bears. 
</P>
<P>
The state declared McNeil a game sanctuary in '67 and in '73 instituted the 
visitor quota program now in place. It seems to have worked. 
</P>
<P>
"Bears are dangerous," Hechtel said, "(but) they're basically playful, amicable 
animals. Breeding, eating and feeding their young are their concerns. People 
say bears are unpredictable, but that's not true. Bears are generally more 
willing to live with people than vice versa. (At McNeil), they haven't gotten 
food from people and the people haven't been threatened by bears, so there 
haven't been any problems." 
</P>
<P>
It bothers Hechtel and the Aumillers when a "rogue" bear is destroyed for 
harming or threatening a person. Usually, the person has unwittingly provoked 
the bear in some way. Larry Aumiller said: "We've tried to create a situation 
where the bears won't be wary of us, (but) we don't want them to be aggressive, 
either. In time, the bears came to realize we are not a threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Bears and people can live together. We have this innate fear, but we also have 
the intellectual capacity to do it. Just don't kill them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO SEE THE BEARS AT THE McNEIL RIVER 
</P>
<P>
Applications for four-day permits to see the bears at the McNeil River in July 
and August may be sent, with $50, to: Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game, 333 
Raspberry Road, Anchorage, Alaska, 99518-1599. Applications must be received by 
May 1. The 140 permittees are selected by lottery. Those not selected receive a 
refund, less a $10 application fee. Applicants should be conditioned to outdoor 
activity. Minimum age is 12. 
</P>
<P>
Since many permits and permit-days are not used, standby applicants ($25 fee) 
may camp at McNeil River base camp for up to seven days to await daily 
openings. Air transportation from Homer is $255. Also, all arrangements, 
including transportation, food, camping and accommodations at the nearby Chenik 
Brown Bear Camp, may be made through the Kachemak Bay Wilderness Lodge, China 
Poot Bay, P.O. Box 956, Homer, AK 99603.

BEACH BOY WILSON ON NEW WAVE OF SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Wilson, the reclusive Beach Boy who has been credited for much of the 
celebrated rock group's success, made a rare public appearance Saturday 
afternoon at the Hard Rock Cafe in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was the dedication ceremony of a gold star honoring the group's 
contributions to pop music. The three-foot-by-three-foot star, set in black 
terrazzo, will be embedded in the sidewalk outside the cafe's front door on the 
corner of Fay Avenue and Prospect Street. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe officials say the star will be the first in a series to be placed in what 
will become a "walk of fame." 
</P>
<P>
Looking fit, trim, and healthy, Wilson, 48, was decidedly out of character. He 
joked, shook hands, signed autographs, and even posed for photographs next to 
the star -- hardly what you'd expect from the shy introvert he's long been 
described to be. 
</P>
<P>
A recluse plagued with drug and alcohol problems during much of the past two 
decades, Wilson has made a significant comeback in recent years. When his first 
solo album, titled "Wilson," came out last year the national rock press went 
wild, with many critics proclaiming it the best thing he's done since the Beach 
Boys' landmark "Pet Sounds" album in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
He's currently working on his second solo album, which will feature such 
prominent guest musicians as Tom Petty, Paula Abdul, Jeff Lynne, and David Lee 
Roth's band. It also reportedly will include Wilson's first rap song, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recording sessions are scheduled to be completed sometime next month; Warner 
Brothers Records is hoping to release the record either this fall or next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has not always appeared so calm and collected. Although he has been 
appearing in concert with the Beach Boys, including six recent Canadian 
concerts, he made a surprise appearance last May, when he walked in on a press 
conference his cousin, Stan Love, had called to discuss a court petition Love 
filed requesting to become the singer's conservator. 
</P>
<P>
In his petition, Love claimed that Wilson has been "brainwashed" by a former 
psychologist who has taken "extensive control" of Wilson's recording 
enterprises -- and his life. 
</P>
<P>
At the May press conference Wilson angrily denied Love's claims, telling 
reporters, "I feel great and my life is back on track. I see who I want to see 
and I am in charge of my own life." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson denied those claims again in an interview with The Times immediately 
following the brief dedication ceremony at the Hard Rock Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson admitted that Eugene Landy is his songwriting partner, his business 
partner, his guidance counselor, and his constant companion. 
</P>
<P>
But he reiterated that the former psychologist doesn't control him; he said he 
motivates him. And he said it's been that way right from the very start of 
their controversial relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"He took the pressure off me -- the pressure that had been holding me back, for 
so many years -- and I got going, I started creating and everything," Wilson 
said. "It wasn't just Gene -- I also had to motivate myself -- but the 
collaborative effect between he and I gives everything I do a special glow. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows how to get me going, he knows what I'm like -- he just knows. He's my 
executive producer, the guy who motivates me and comes up with the concept of 
what I'm doing. I carry it out, and somehow, it works -- I don't know how, but 
it does. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's really all there is to it." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the interview, Wilson sat sandwiched between Landy and Landy's 
mother-in-law. Before answering each question, he turned to Landy, as if for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
And on one occasion, Wilson referred to Landy as "my boss," then quickly 
corrected himself by saying, 'He's not my boss, he's my teacher.' 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's comeback has come since he began receiving treatment from Landy in the 
late 1980s, after nearly two decades of being criticized for mediocre 
songwriting. During the 1970s and early '80s he also made only infrequent live 
appearances with the Beach Boys and was continually unsuccessful in his 
attempts to conquer his drug- and alcohol-induced illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
During the past two to three years, Wilson has stepped up his touring schedule 
with the Beach Boys, playing upwards of 30 dates a year. And he has become 
sober, thanks, he says, to 24-hour-a-day therapy with Landy. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson appeared pleased with his new projects, and he expressed optimism about 
his work: "The new album, even at the stage it's in, is better than the first 
album," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a knockout. I just got done listening to the tracks we've 
cut, and I felt proud. It was a tense moment in my life, because I'm very 
self-critical about my art and the stuff we (he and Landy) do together, 
collaborating and everything -- it's quite an endeavor to do that," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"So it was a very tense moment, but at the same time, it was very beautiful. 
The first ten minutes of any songwriting are the hardest, but once you get 
through those ten minutes, once you conquer that original doubt, if you do 
conquer it, then you can go on, and that makes you feel proud." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is also working on his autobiography, which he's co- writing with People 
magazine's Todd Gold. The book's working title is "Love and Mercy," and it is 
scheduled to be published by Harper and Row in the fall of next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to be a person who had no ability to communicate with people," Wilson 
said. "I was a loser person in life, but now I'm a new person. I'm positive, I 
burn off positive energy, I give positive music to the people and it works, I'm 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
"Gene helped me realize that life is not a thankless job, which is what I used 
to think. Life is giving -- in my case, giving music -- and that's your reward, 
right there."

TALL TALES AND LEGENDS SIDETRACK SCHOLARS IN SEARCH OF FACTS ON BILLY THE KID

LINCOLN, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation was stunned in spring, 1881, when a 21-year-old condemned outlaw 
blew away two deputies at the old courthouse here, stole a horse and rode off 
into the rugged Capitan Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Just three months later, Henry McCarty, a.k.a. Billy the Kid, was dead, shot 
down by Sheriff Pat Garrett in the darkened bedroom of a Ft. Sumner ranch 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The Kid has yielded none of his claim on the popular imagination 109 years 
after meeting his violent end. Yet he remains as elusive to would-be 
interpreters as he was to the lawmen of his day. 
</P>
<P>
Scholars in recent years have sought to set the record straight, separating the 
historical Kid from the extravagant legends that grew up around him. 
</P>
<P>
But serious historians must contend with a multitude of movies and novels that 
continue a long, if tarnished tradition of using the Kid's exploits as the 
basis for spinning a profitable yarn. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very much alive, much more so than most of us will be after we're gone," 
says Paul Andrew Hutton, a history professor at the University of New Mexico 
who has studied books and films about the Kid. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 films somehow have included the Kid, including the likes of John 
Wayne's "Chisum"; "The Outlaw," with Jane Russell, and "Bill and Ted's 
Excellent Adventure," in which time-traveling high school students meet the 
outlaw to prepare for a history quiz. 
</P>
<P>
Recent novels on the subject include Larry McMurtry's "Anything for Billy" and 
N. Scott Momaday's "The Ancient Child." 
</P>
<P>
While interest in the Kid has waxed and waned over the years, his cinematic and 
literary portrayals tend to reflect the times in which they are produced, 
Hutton says. 
</P>
<P>
The first films about the Kid, made in the 1930s, rendered him a 
Depression-era, monopoly-busting idealist. By 1972, when "Pat Garrett and Billy 
the Kid" debuted, the Kid had become a violent, if charming anarchist. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the films "Young Guns" and the soon-to-be-released sequel, 
"Young Guns II," starring Brat Pack actors Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland 
and Lou Diamond Phillips, have breathed new life into the Kid's legend, even as 
they have cast him in a new light, Hutton says. 
</P>
<P>
"During our own time, he's sort of a hip young gang leader -- the Crips come to 
New Mexico," Hutton says. 
</P>
<P>
Historian Robert M. Utley, whose 1989 book, "Billy the Kid: a Short and Violent 
Life," has sold briskly, counts the Kid among those "rare flexible characters 
who can be whoever you want them to be." Indeed, there is not even agreement 
about the Kid's real name, which many had believed to be William Bonney but 
which Utley has established through records to more likely be McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
Utley has sorted through the myths about the outlaw, whom he has come to view 
as a likable, clever post-adolescent who easily lost his temper and acted 
impulsively. The Kid's resort to violence was not unusual for the times, Utley 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not the premiere outlaw he has been portrayed in legend," Utley says. 
The Kid, like other rootless drifters living on a lawless frontier, made do 
primarily with gambling and occasional cattle rustling, Utley says. 
</P>
<P>
By Utley's count, the Kid definitely committed only four killings and may have 
joined in up to six others. Legend has long held that he killed 21 men. 
</P>
<P>
The Kid found notoriety during the brief, bloody Lincoln County War of 1878, 
which had its roots in a contest between Englishman John Tunstall and local 
businessmen J. J. Dolan and L. G. Murphy for the right to sell provisions to a 
nearby Army post and Indian reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Tunstall's murder led to a series of revenge killings between his followers, 
known as the Regulators, and the Dolan-Murphy forces. 
</P>
<P>
In following months, the Kid joined other Regulators in the ambush slaying of 
Sheriff William Brady and led a daring escape from a burning house following a 
five-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually caught and convicted of Brady's murder, the Kid was jailed on the 
second-floor of the courthouse, awaiting execution, when he shot down two 
guards and made his getaway on April 28, 1881. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, an acquaintance of the Kid's, ran him to ground at Pete Maxwell's 
ranch a few months later, on July 14. 
</P>
<P>
The Kid's legend began to take shape when territorial newspapers dubbed him 
Billy the Kid in the wake of his jailbreak. 
</P>
<P>
A year after the Kid's death, Garrett and ghostwriter Ash Upson published an 
"Authentic Life of Billy the Kid," a heavily embroidered tale that tainted most 
subsequent writing about the outlaw. 
</P>
<P>
In 1926, Chicago newsman Walter Noble Burns revived interest in the Kid when he 
wrote "The Saga of Billy the Kid," portraying him as an Old West Robin Hood. 
</P>
<P>
In Lincoln, where descendants of Sheriff Brady and other participants of the 
war still reside, questions about the Kid's conduct and who wronged whom during 
the deadly conflict are of more than academic interest. 
</P>
<P>
The village's three dozen or so adobe buildings, lining a quiet, 
juniper-studded canyon along the Rio Bonito, are little changed since the last 
century. Through the Lincoln County Heritage Trust, residents have established 
a walking tour and several museums that explore the area's rich history. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Ft. Sumner, a ranching town on the Pecos River 90 miles to the 
northeast, no garish billboards advertise the Kid's exploits. In fact, Lincoln 
has established an historical district that restricts all home remodeling and 
construction in the interest of authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of fraud in this business," says trust director Robert Hart. 
"There are lots of people trying to sell something." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of "Young Guns," and seeking to promote serious scholarship about 
the Lincoln County War, Hart got the trust to sponsor a computer study of old 
photographs thought to be of the Kid. The trust holds in its collection the 
only authenticated photo of the outlaw, an 1879 tintype taken while he was at 
Ft. Sumner. 
</P>
<P>
The project, scheduled for completion in 1991, has already demolished the late 
Ollie "Brushy Bill" Roberts' claim to be the Kid. Roberts, who died in 1950 in 
the West Texas town of Hico, maintained Garrett had shot the wrong man. A 
computer comparison of Brushy Bill's and the Kid's facial features found few 
similarities, but that hasn't persuaded a small number of Brushy Bill 
die-hards, Hart says. 
</P>
<P>
Hart agrees with Utley's explanation for the public's continued fascination 
with the Kid: "You've got 180 degrees here," Hart says. "You've got Billy the 
angel and Billy the demonic killer."

HOMECLUB CHAIN'S NEW BOSS HAS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM

<TEXT>
<P>
James F. Halpin talks above the scream of buzz saws and the pounding of nails 
at HomeClub Inc.'s corporate headquarters in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems appropriate that the sounds of construction, rather than piped-in 
music, should ring through the halls of HomeClub's nerve center. For the chain 
is where many contractors and homeowners alike go to to find lumber and nails 
-- as well as Christmas lights, garage doors and daffodils. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction noise was the result of changes ordered by Halpin, who is 
already making an imprint after two months on the job as president of the 
membership home-supplies company. 
</P>
<P>
 HomeClub, a unit of Natick, Mass.-based Waban Inc., introduced the latest 
twist to the home-center concept that developed during the postwar boom in 
suburban tract home construction in Southern California. HomeClub and its 
archrival, Home Depot, are warehouse-type stores offering a wider variety of 
items than an ordinary home center at discount prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Their stores look like warehouses, with concrete floors, open rafters and 
merchandise stacked on pallets to the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 The formula has spelled trouble for some home-supply chains that haven't 
adopted the warehouse concept. Citing competition from HomeClub and Home Depot, 
National Lumber &amp; Supply Inc., a small chain of home-supply stores in 
Southern California, was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing fierce competition in the industry, Halpin has more than his share of 
challenges ahead. He is the fourth HomeClub president in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Halpin joined HomeClub in May from his job as president of BJ's Wholesale 
Club, a chain of membership discount department stores in the East. He was vice 
president and general merchandising manager of the chain from 1987 to 1989. 
From 1982 to 1987, he was vice president and senior merchandise manager of the 
Zayre Stores Division of Zayre Corp., an East Coast retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with Times staff writer Chris Woodyard, Halpin discussed 
his plans for HomeClub's continued expansion and what he views as the key 
ingredients to the success of home center chain.

<P>
 Q. What is your impression of the home center industry in Southern California? 
</P>
<P>
A. I've been in retail for 20 years. Right now I'm entering the most exciting 
phase of my career. We have 62 stores. Home Depot has 120. And the country 
could hold 1,500. It's a $100-billion industry that's wide open. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about other, non-warehouse home centers? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are a lot more home centers. But they are typically 30,000-35,000 
square feet. But the format I'm talking about is the power format of 110,000 to 
140,000 square feet. You walk downstairs in our Fullerton store and I'll build 
you a house. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why does the warehouse formula work so well? 
</P>
<P>
A. Because of what you are giving the customers: wide selection, price, some 
service and (products that) are always in stock. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why is that more efficient than a smaller operation? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's a one-stop shop and we have lower gross margins. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Competitors charge that the warehouse-type home centers are too big, 
impersonal and that it's difficult to find a particular item. 
</P>
<P>
A. We're making them more personal. What we're all doing is evolving to more 
service. As our volumes grow, we can throw off more gross profit dollars and 
add service without increasing our prices. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you make it easier to find things? 
</P>
<P>
A. We have people who will help you find it. We have a projects center. We have 
a computer that will help you design an entire kitchen. We're moving more and 
more toward that in the power format. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But home centers have been around since World War II. What makes the 
warehouse concept so exciting all of a sudden? 
</P>
<P>
A. Let me compare it to another industry. There have been toy stores since the 
beginning of time. Why is Toys R Us exciting? Isn't that what we are? Aren't we 
the Toys R Us of the building supply industry? 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you judge what the best size for a store should be? 
</P>
<P>
A. We're learning. At one point, we opened them up at 80,000 (square feet) and 
thought that was optimum. Then we went to 110,000 and thought that was optimum. 
Over time, we'll evolve to 140,000-square-foot stores. We'll get bigger 
nurseries and bigger lumber yards. As our volumes grow . . . we'll have to keep 
on increasing the size of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the most profitable centers of a home center store? 
</P>
<P>
A. Kitchen cabinets, any custom goods. Your margins are better but you eat them 
because you have to offer a lot of service. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there a particular part of your stores that is more profitable than 
others? 
</P>
<P>
A. No, the overall format makes money. For example, at Price Club, what is 
their most profitable area? It is their hot dog cart. Does that mean everyone 
should put in hot dog carts? No. Price Club makes money because of its overall 
format. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Aren't profit margins extremely low in the home center industry? 
</P>
<P>
A. They are extremely low for us and for Home Depot. One of the things that has 
validated our concept is the industry had higher profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Has the trend been toward a "low-price every day" concept? What is the 
advantage of that? 
</P>
<P>
A. Consistency. You know, we do a big business with contractors. They have to 
know what the Sheetrock is going to cost every day. It can't be $2.99 one day, 
$4.29 the next day, so that they run over to Builders Emporium. It's a 
convenience, and it's real. Why do people run ads? They run ads to disguise 
their high prices. They run loss leaders to hook (customers) in. (Home Club's 
strategy is to) give them a low price every day . . . and let them do all their 
shopping with us rather than getting their drywall from us, screws from 
somebody else and a Stanley tape (measure) from somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the disadvantages of the every-day low-price policy? 
</P>
<P>
A. The thing that can happen is someone can sell things below cost or have loss 
leaders that make you seem high-priced. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the advantages of having a membership store? 
</P>
<P>
A. Lower prices, because typically your members will spend more. The higher 
average transaction reduces your operating costs, therefore reducing your need 
for gross margins. It takes almost as much time to ring up a $20 sale as it 
does to ring up someone spending $50. By having membership, we have a more 
committed customer. They are spending more. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the disadvantages of membership? 
</P>
<P>
A. Some people (who aren't members) think they can't come in. It's not true. 
Anyone can come in; it's just that non-members pay 5% more. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What do you think of HomeClub's concept of having the store open to both 
members and non-members? 
</P>
<P>
A. I'm not sure. I've only been here two months. I'm studying it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you happy with the way the format has worked? 
</P>
<P>
A. HomeClub has got to do a better job of service. I believe these formats have 
to do a better job of servicing customers. I grew up with two rules. First, the 
customer is always right. The second rule is that, when the customer is wrong, 
go back to number one. The way you're successful is giving the customer what 
they want. The customer in this business wants service and needs service. We 
are trying to expand the do-it-yourself market. I'm trying to get (the 
customer) to do projects that he never thought he could do. You probably never 
thought you could build a deck. I want us to have the level of service that 
will talk you into building a deck. If we can get you to build a deck, we may 
get you to build a garage. And once you build a garage, we'll get you to put on 
a roof. I want to expand our customer's base of knowledge, and I need service 
to do that. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Isn't it hard to find employees with that kind of expertise? 
</P>
<P>
A. They come trained. This is a wonderful place for some of our senior citizens 
-- a retired carpenter or a retired plumber. They can come to us and work and 
do the training. They can work at the project desk. Some of them can look at a 
key and cut it with their eye; they don't need the machines. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Doesn't that increase your costs by spending on training? 
</P>
<P>
A. There is training that has to be done. We spend a lot of money on training. 
But what we have to our advantage is the volume that we're doing. When you look 
at these units doing $25 million or $30 million (a year in sales), there's 
enough gross margin there to train people. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you describe yourself as a hands-on manager? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yeah. It's the only style I know. . . . On weekends, I'll travel stores in 
jeans and a T-shirt. Since they don't know me, if I'm happy with the store, I 
stop and introduce myself and have a nice meeting with the store manager. If 
I'm not happy, I won't introduce myself. And the reason I don't introduce 
myself is that, hey, I want my first meeting with this store manager to be a 
pleasant one. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How can you tell if you are reaching the customer's needs? 
</P>
<P>
A. One of the things you need is state-of-the-art computers to keep spinning 
information for you different ways. I believe that, in the long term, we 
merchants have to change our thought process. Typically, all merchants want to 
think about is whether a particular item is profitable. I don't care about the 
item. I don't want to know about the item. I want to look at our customers. 
</P>
<P>
When I was at BJ's -- BJ's is like a Price Club -- we discontinued cheesecakes 
in Hialeah, Fla., because we were only selling five cheesecakes a week, so they 
weren't profitable. I got a call from the owner of a restaurant. He said, 'I've 
been buying five cheesecakes a week from you for the last year and you 
discontinued them. Why are you doing that to me?' I pushed a button on the 
computer. He was doing $120,000 of business a year with us. Now, was that 
cheesecake profitable? I would say it certainly was. So we have to go beyond 
looking at the profitability of the item. We have to look at the profitability 
of our customers. 
</P>
<P>
That's why I'll study our contractor, our roofer or our plumber to find out how 
to enhance their business. If I have a contractor coming in once a week, I have 
to figure out what he needs. I have to start looking at the plumber as a 
business, and not only look at sales of a particular item.
