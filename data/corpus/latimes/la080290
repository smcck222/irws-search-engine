AL MARTINEZ: REQUIEM FOR A GOLDEN GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She was a Malibu golden girl, the kind you see running along the beach, as 
natural as sunlight on the surf. 
</P>
<P>
She had an outdoor look you can't buy in a beauty parlor, and a tan you don't 
get lying under lights. 
</P>
<P>
Combine those traits with an ebullience that glows like the first day of spring 
and you have a woman whose appearance turns heads. 
</P>
<P>
That was Tracy Clarke, a golden girl par excellence . . . but she was more than 
that. Taking care of everybody's grandma was her speciality, and she did it 
well. 
</P>
<P>
That's what struck me about her. 
</P>
<P>
She should have been modeling bikinis or posing as a poster girl for milk, not 
tending to the needs of the aged. You don't bury her kind of beauty beneath the 
woes of people who can hardly walk. 
</P>
<P>
I realize that's stereotyping. Looks don't determine compassion anymore than 
age determines value. 
</P>
<P>
But when I met Tracy a year and a half ago, I had to wonder: What in the hell 
is a woman who looks like she stepped out of a dream doing distributing food to 
old people? 
</P>
<P>
When I asked her that she laughed and said, "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
I wrote about her then and I can still hear the laughter as I write about her 
today. But the context is different. The laughter has been stilled. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Clarke, age 26, was killed last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It was on one of those mornings you sometimes get along the ocean, where God 
paints glory in the sky and strews diamonds on the waves. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy was bicycling with three others along Pacific Coast Highway, getting 
ready for an Iron Man Contest in British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The car came out of nowhere, a kid behind the wheel, and it picked the Golden 
Girl out of the line of riders and tossed her 80 feet through the air. 
</P>
<P>
She was probably dead by the time she hit the ground and lay there like a 
broken doll. 
</P>
<P>
The car dragged her bike a mile before it stopped. The driver, a 20-year-old 
named Danilo Herrera, was charged with manslaughter and driving under the 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy's death has stunned Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
She was the kind of person everyone seemed to know. Hundreds have telephoned 
their sorrow to her mother, her husband and her grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of those calls came from a retirement village in Thousand Oaks where 
Tracy worked as an activities director, and from an Agoura Hills senior center 
where she taught elderly people to swim. 
</P>
<P>
In between, she worked as a lifeguard at the ocean, one of the few able to pass 
the rigorous tests to save lives in a surf that can pound with thundering force 
along the curving shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
She ran, bicycled or swam every morning of her life, and she looked it. 
</P>
<P>
"Tracy was always busy," her grandmother said. "She loved people so." 
</P>
<P>
But why old people? 
</P>
<P>
Her mother answered: "She never really said why. Someone created the interest 
and she pursued it." 
</P>
<P>
She holds no animosity toward the young man who caused her daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what damage alcohol can do. Tracy's father died of it. My heart goes 
out to that boy. He'll have to spend the rest of his life knowing he killed 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
I met Tracy as she was distributing cheese to needy old people at an Agoura 
Hills country club. Columnists feed on situations like that. 
</P>
<P>
Poor people in a community where the average household income is $50,000 a 
year? Food distribution at a country club? 
</P>
<P>
And then there was the dichotomy of Tracy and the old people, a golden girl 
caring about the silver-haired. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't really the kind of food they ought to be having," Tracy said to me as 
we stood in the sunlight. She was wearing a pink skirt, white blouse and 
sandals. She looked Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, I thought she might say they ought to be giving the people sushi 
or Cajun chicken wings, but that wasn't it at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheese is high in salt and fat," she said, frowning with concern. "They 
deserve a healthier food." 
</P>
<P>
I learned something that day. You don't have to be homely and come from a 
ghetto to care about others. You don't have to have lived a life of poverty to 
be concerned with the impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy was a person whose compassion reached beyond the lines of age, economics 
and cosmetic beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Giving was intrinsic to her nature, and many are the poorer for her death. 
</P>
<P>
More than 22,000 men, women and children died last year in the United States in 
alcohol-related traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy's mother wants her daughter's legacy to be an awareness of that fact. 
Even in death the Golden Girl of Malibu will continue to serve the people she 
loved. And that's about as beautiful as anyone ever gets.

The dime novels always talk about cops putting people on the hot seat, but 
c'mon. 
</P>
<P>
A self-contained trailer fitted out with six solar-powered bathrooms will be 
delivered next week to the Los Angeles Police Department from a Riverside firm 
whose proud motto is, "We offer luxury seating." 
</P>
<P>
The man who coordinated this for the LAPD's tactical planning unit is Sgt. Stan 
Roberts, and the guys have given him quite enough ribbing about "Stan's cans." 
</P>
<P>
The city had been looking for some time for a portable system it could use in 
outdoor operations like an earthquake, for example. This one they can trundle 
out to "situations like Operation Rescue (daylong mass arrests)," Roberts said, 
"and field emergency operations where there's no hand-washing facilities 
available, and no power sources. These things run on their own solar-charged 
cells." 
</P>
<P>
Sam R. Torres created Solar Sanitation Systems three years ago, and now his 
potties are invited to all the best places, like the opening of the Nixon 
Library in Orange County and PGA tournaments. His are rather like airline 
bathrooms, and more sanitary than hole-in-one portable toilets, he says. The 
solar power provides lights as well as running water for flushing and for the 
stainless steel sink. He added a bit of carpeting, after golfers' cleats 
scarred the linoleum. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy has ordered some, and so, says Torres, has the Soviet Union, 
where people are used to standing in line for everything. 
</P>
<P>
But, is it Art? No, it's Jonell -- Jonell Gomez, a painter photographed on his 
way to a job in a Hollywood building. Pictures can deceive: Gomez was not the 
art critic responsible for the comment painted above the graffiti on the 
building's exterior. His job is to paint the interior. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, our answer to the graffiti question is, No, we can't read it. Can 
you? We hear so much about slum dwellings that we now pause for some anecdotes 
about the high-priced spreads. 
</P>
<P>
The current Southern California Real Estate Journal invited property managers 
to unburden themselves in its pages, and they bewail luxury condo and 
office-building tenants who have: 
</P>
<P>
 -- used the sauna to thaw frozen turkeys; 
</P>
<P>
 -- hung meat in the elevators to harass other tenants; 
</P>
<P>
 -- shut down one elevator at the same time every day to have sex between 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
One tenant with a fancy aquarium demanded to be reimbursed 20 fins per fish 
(that's $100 in old street slang) after some of them died when the 
air-conditioning failed. The property manager noted that the lease offered no 
provision for that, and the tenant relented, but sniffled, "It would have been 
nice if you had sent a condolence card, or went to the funeral." 
</P>
<P>
That special phone number Todd Witteles asked for last year because it was 
"easy to remember," the one with 7777 as the last four digits -- it's been 
rather too easy. 
</P>
<P>
First, giggly schoolgirls happened onto it, and now call up daily to hear 
Witteles' ever-changing messages on his answering machine in Rancho Palos 
Verdes. Then, "every little baby in the area seems to pick up the phone and 
randomly dial my number," the result being endless recordings of "a lot of 
babbling, then some father yelling 'Hang up that phone!' " 
</P>
<P>
The worst, though, came not long ago, when some investment house ran a 
newspaper ad with the same phone number, preceded by "this very small 800." So 
small that several hundred readers didn't even see it, and all called Witteles 
for investment information. 
</P>
<P>
Never seek financial advice from a ticked-off 18-year-old. Witteles said he 
left a "nasty message" on his machine, and within days, a new ad appeared, with 
a new number to call, and the 800 part printed "real big." 
</P>
<P>
Seen dockside: Adel Nasrallah, also known as Eddie Nash, awaiting a new trial 
after a mistrial in the quadruple 1981 Laurel Canyon murders, had his day in 
someone else's court on Wednesday. Nash, held without bail and wearing jail 
blues, testified during the penalty phase for Linell Dumas, convicted of 
murdering the mother of a sheriff's deputy. Nash appeared as a character 
witness.

Your article was appalling. I found it to be inaccurate and misleading. You 
based your information on facts from one class and only a few others spoken to. 
</P>
<P>
First, not everyone who attends GAIN falls under the categories written about. 
I volunteered to participate in this program. I am neither illiterate nor 
uneducated to the point of not knowing how to add or subtract. 
</P>
<P>
I do not use drugs. I have not been to jail or have any type of record or 
history of violence or an attitude problem. 
</P>
<P>
Our school is not a school of last resort. It is a second chance for us to 
better ourselves and our life situations. I sincerely suggest you recheck your 
facts and stop prejudging others. This prejudging causes prejudice, which can 
hurt this valuable program.

The total disregard for anything positive was distressing to the majority of 
students at the school. 
</P>
<P>
I, myself, was distressed by this because I see the positive every day. 
</P>
<P>
I am an instructional aide with the Oxnard Adult School and have been employed 
at the GAIN School for two years. Prior to this job I had been on and off of 
welfare at different times for the past four years. I was not made to attend 
classes at GAIN because I was employed most of the time, but I can relate to 
the students and sympathize with their point of view. 
</P>
<P>
It is not fair to create such a narrow view of the GAIN students. The majority 
work very hard and have many successes. The article seemed, judging from the 
title, to be about the whole school, which in fact it was not. Mr. Reynolds did 
not interview the entire staff or the students. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't speak with me, and I run the computer lab. The lab is a place where 
you see the students make strides. They learn to use the many programs 
including typing, word processing and, more importantly, for some to overcome a 
fear of technology. Most have never been close to a computer and soon they are 
mastering a program such as Wordperfect 4.2. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, I could go on and on about the students here at the GAIN 
School. I enjoy working with them; their successes I share as well as their 
shortcomings. I hope that in the future perhaps I will read an article in your 
newspaper about their successes.

ANNIVERSARY OF COLUMBUS' DISCOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rodriguez asks us not to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Christopher 
Columbus' great adventure, which he prefers to call "genocide." 
</P>
<P>
Forget for the moment that Spain's attitude towards the indigenous peoples of 
America was no different than it was toward non-Christians at home, and in the 
same year that Columbus sailed into the unknown the Jews were driven out of 
Spain, forced to leave all of their property behind them, and that the horrors 
of the Inquisition were in full control of the lives of the people of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
No, Mr. Rodriguez, we are not going to celebrate genocide, but rather the 
accomplishment of one rather courageous individual, whose adventure still 
stands as the greatest voyage of mankind, including Neil Armstrong's walk on 
the moon. In truth, a parallel would have Armstrong pleading with the President 
-- over a period of eight years -- for use of a castoff spaceship and the 
company of a few criminals and debtors to go with him on a voyage that he would 
plan and carry out alone. 
</P>
<P>
Columbus' serendipity -- a new world instead of China and Japan -- brought 
lesser men after him, and when he punished a few Spanish gentlemen for 
murdering Indians he was himself removed from power and returned to Spain in 
chains.

KILLING OF DOG ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing with a sense of deep outrage about the deliberate killing of a dog 
run over by members of the California Highway Patrol on the Harbor Freeway 
(Metro, July 20). 
</P>
<P>
The dog must have been in a state of terror and confusion after 20 minutes of 
(efforts) to catch it. These are people who are supposed to represent law and 
order, sanity and not insanity and certainly not outright cruelty toward a 
helpless, frightened creature. 
</P>
<P>
It was an appalling, vicious act and no excuses about the safety of those 
people driving on the freeway are in order here. The traffic could have 
remained stopped until the dog was out of harm's way.

ANNIVERSARY OF COLUMBUS' DISCOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a commentary published by The Times on July 23, Roberto Rodriguez underlines 
all the negative aspects of the 500th anniversary of the first voyage of 
Christopher Columbus to America, and the subsequent exploration and 
colonization of the continent by Spain. 
</P>
<P>
In Spain the 1492 anniversary is not officially denominated "celebration" but 
"commemoration." Although we are celebrating the spirit of enterprise and the 
human and technical resources that made possible the encounter between the Old 
and the New World, we are not necessarily proud of everything that happened in 
the subsequent colonization of America. Every conquest, would it be the Roman 
conquest, the Arab invasion of Spain or the more recent colonization of Africa 
by European states -- brings with it almost certainly acts of violence and 
injustice. 
</P>
<P>
As Rodriguez rightfully points out Bartolome de Las Casas, a Dominican, was the 
first Spanish friar to denounce the acts of abuse and violence in the early 
period of the conquest. Although it is historically proved that Las Casas, 
maybe in good faith, underscored the darkest side and multiplied the number of 
casualties, not only were his charges freely published and recognized by the 
Spanish authorities, but the friar was appointed Bishop of Chiapas, and the 
Spanish Crown took his claims in consideration when drafting the legal Corpus 
known as the "Leyes de Indias" (Laws for the Indies) aimed to protect the 
native welfare. However, Las Casas writings were to be used by the colonial 
rival powers of Spain in what has been known, for the last four centuries, as 
the Spanish "Black Legend." 
</P>
<P>
When Rodriguez repeatedly condemns the Spanish "Black Legend" as "the 
philosophical basis that makes possible the celebration of the Quincentennial," 
"the Black Legend serves the purpose of absolving Spain of guilt by claiming 
that its colonization was humane" he is either ignoring the basic historical 
background in which the events should be discussed or confusing it with the 
"White Legend," which is the Spanish response to the "Black Legend." 
</P>
<P>
When approaching 1992, it is the purpose of the democratic government of Spain 
to accept the different perspectives on the issue, encourage, dialogue and make 
this anniversary a good opportunity for historical revision, without trying to 
ignore the negative sides of the conquest.

shepherd from the Harbor Freeway, why didn't they call Animal Control? Perhaps 
someone trained to humanely capture animals could have handled the matter in a 
more professional way.

PERSPECTIVE ON LATIN AMERICA; 
</P>
<P>
STRIKE NOW WHILE COCA IS HURTING; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH'S LATIN TRADE PLAN IS ADMIRABLE AND THRIFTY. BUT IT FAILS TO ADDRESS THE 
DRUG ISSUE, EVEN THOUGH THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR ECONOMIC CURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GUSTAVO GORRITI, Gustavo Gorriti is a journalist based in Lima, Peru. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush initiative calling for hemispheric free trade took Latin America by 
surprise. That's what good strategy is supposed to achieve. The initiative had 
excellent timing and even a vision -- except that it forgot the war on drugs -- 
offering as a common goal for the Americas a Hemisphere ruled by the voting 
booth and the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, if behind the initiative you perceive the brains of a statesman, you'll 
also notice the heart of an accountant, as the resources committed to put it in 
motion couldn't be faulted for lacking thriftiness. Not that one should expect 
to find George Marshall's spirit inspiring George Bush's White House. But 
President Bush has amazed millions of people -- from the freedom-stricken 
masses of Warsaw, Prague and Budapest to the poverty- and violence-stricken 
masses of Bogota, Rio de Janeiro and Lima -- by telling them how many lofty 
things he expects them to achieve with so little. What is even more surprising 
is that he not only gets away with it, but does so to the sound of applause. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's Latin American initiative announced at the end of June was widely 
welcomed because many Latin Americans feared, and many U.S. academics and 
politicians had announced, that in the new world order, Latin America would 
become increasingly irrelevant -- a big geographic and demographic expanse left 
largely untouched by increasingly freer and more sophisticated trade, and by 
dynamic and highly prized investment capital. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush had, it appears, a more objective vision. Latin America is bound 
to increase in importance for the United States in the near future, and the 
reciprocal is true. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the issues that have simultaneous domestic and hemispheric significance 
-- immigration, the environment -- will probably increase in scope. They are 
what the Inter-American Dialogue's Abraham P. Lowenthal has called,accurately 
if not poetically, the "intermestic" issues, both international and domestic. 
You have to credit Bush for understanding what perestrioka-bedazzled academics 
and politicians failed to see. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush initiative did, however, fail to address the one "intermestic" area, 
the war on drugs, that is most in need of an innovative, better-designed 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
Bush showed innovation, for instance, on the environmental front. The U.S. 
economic initiative recommended the creation of "environmental trusts" to be 
funded through interest payments on U.S. government loans, a low-cost form of 
the currently trendy "debt-for-nature" swap. The funds would finance 
environmental preservation programs in debtor countries. 
</P>
<P>
But this positive reinforcement approach, which takes into account the economic 
dimension of the problem, has been and still is entirely lacking in the drug 
war, the one that should have been fought primarily in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, positive reinforcement policies are easier on the environmental 
front, where governments are essentially given incentives to keep things (the 
environment) as they are. In the case of the drug war, we are trying to change 
things into what they should be. A major undertaking indeed, considering that 
hundreds of thousands of people depend directly on the coca economy, and that 
the national economy of even a virtually bankrupt country such as Peru (where 
about 60% of the world's illegal coca is cultivated) depends to a significant 
extent on the hard-currency income that cocaine exports bring. 
</P>
<P>
But probably for the first time since the cocaine boom began in the 1970s, 
market conditions are adverse to illegal coca production. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, 1989, coca leaf, cocaine paste and cocaine base prices in the 
source countries have stayed below the break-even point. In Peru's Upper 
Huallaga Valley, the world's most important coca production region, the price 
of one kilogram of coca leaf ranges now from 22 to 53 cents, down from $2.64 to 
$3.52 during the first seven months of 1989. The break-even price, according to 
both coca farmers and U.S. Embassy officials in Lima, is 65 cents per kilo. 
Cocaine paste prices range from $110 to $180 per kilo (from $450-$600 during 
the first half of last year.) And cocaine base prices go from $400 to $450 
(from $1,000 to $1,300). 
</P>
<P>
During the last few months, the Shining Path rebels made the mistake Marxist 
movements are bound to commit and tried to order producers not to sell below 
the prices it set, about 30% above the going rate. The Shining Path has failed 
so far to enforce its price, even with executions, which is at least an 
embarrassing loss of face for the guerrilla organization. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, with cocaine stockpiles apparently depleted, cocaine prices 
have begun to climb in the United States for the first time in many years. 
</P>
<P>
This is certainly a transitory situation, but it is also a historical 
opportunity to really reduce coca supply through vigorous efforts to develop 
legal economic alternatives in the producing areas. Most of the well-organized 
Upper Huallaga coca producers are now more than willing to engage in legal 
alternative economic projects. They tried to get in touch with Bush during this 
year's Cartagena summit, but were rejected out of hand by image-conscious drug 
warriors. They have also written letters, so far unanswered, to "Jorge" Bush. 
</P>
<P>
So, to seize the opportunity: why not a strategy strongly centered on 
developing legal alternative economies in the cocaine-producing areas, using 
security forces only as an adjunct? Throw out the military-centered approach, 
which the U.S. government keeps pressuring the Andrean countries to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
And as part of it, why not a debt-for-drugs swap? This could be used, for 
instance, to finance the Peruvian or Bolivian contributions in joint efforts 
with the United States and other cocaine- market countries to create viable 
legal economies in the coca-producing areas. Rural development experts estimate 
that the cost of developing an alternative legal economy in the Upper Huallaga 
would be about $1 billion over five years of which about $800 million would be 
in long-term, low-interest credit and about $200 million in straight economic 
assistance. This assumes, of course, that people in the area have the will to 
participate in such a program, which is now the case. 
</P>
<P>
A debt-for-drugs program would give otherwise bankrupt economies a way to 
participate meaningfully in coca-economy substitution efforts. And the cost is 
modest when compared with the military resources now enlisted in the drug war. 
Which is something not only a statesman but even an accountant would approve.

AMERICANS HAVE HAD ENOUGH; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS POLLUTED WITH FILTH CAN MAKE A SOCIETY SICK UNTO DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. BUCHANAN, Patrick J. Buchanan writes a syndicated column from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Referring to Roseanne Barr's rendition of the national anthem, before the San 
Diego Padres-Cincinnati Reds game, Johnny Carson joked, "I haven't heard a 
sound like that since I had my cat neutered." 
</P>
<P>
As Barr finished shrieking out the verses of "The Star-Spangled Banner," 30,000 
fans stood and booed. She then grabbed her crotch and spat. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Roseanne's patented crudity didn't play; she went too far. Players 
and fans alike were revolted by her swinish mockery of a ceremony Americans 
take as a sign of reverence for their country. The singing of the national 
anthem is a moment of patriotic unity, of suspended disagreement, before 
athletic rivalries ensue. The booing at Jack Murphy Stadium spoke not only for 
the President, who found her conduct outrageous, but for the country. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, just maybe, Americans have had enough. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the rutting music of 2 Live Crew, lyrics to which are so vile they 
cannot be printed here, got a Ft. Lauderdale distributor charged with obscenity 
-- to general applause. 
</P>
<P>
The National Endowment for the Arts has become a standing joke around every 
political campfire for funding an exhibit of the late Robert Mapplethorpe's 
photographs that featured a shot of him with a bullwhip sticking out of his 
rectum, for funding the "Piss Christ" of Andres Serrano, for funding the 
performances of one New York lady who masturbates and urinates on stage. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 12 months, America has begun to react as a healthy body ought when 
slowly fed poisons that can kill it. But reaction is not enough. Conservatives 
need to exploit this mood of national rage against filthy and blasphemous art, 
against general coarseness and crudity, to rally a movement to recapture 
America's culture. 
</P>
<P>
"Seventy years ago," James Cooper writes in American Arts Quarterly, "the 
Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci . . . wrote (that) the important mission for 
Socialism was to 'capture the culture.' By the end of World War II, the liberal 
Left had managed to capture not only the arts, theater, literature, music and 
ballet, but also motion pictures, photography, education and the media." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere was the capture more complete than the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, in Washington, there appeared a new sculpture -- rows of oil drums, 
protruding from the ground at 45 degrees, up to 15 feet in the air, painted 
gold. Someone said the meaning of the work has to do with the price of oil. 
</P>
<P>
It is minimalist junk of a kind to be found today in front of virtually every 
federal building in Washington. Where did this junk come from? How did this 
happen, when conservatives have won five of six national elections, and, 
presumably, had a voice in what kind of "art" went in front of our federal 
buildings? 
</P>
<P>
To most Americans, as long as the art is not outrageous, it is irrelevant. This 
is a mistake. Just as water polluted with mercury will slowly destroy the 
brain, drinking for decades from a culture polluted with modernist dreck can 
make a society sick unto death. 
</P>
<P>
"(W)hile conservatives have kept alive a political alternative to Marxism 
(capitalism)," Cooper writes, "they abandoned cultural standards that might 
serve as an alternative to modernism. 
</P>
<P>
"In the words of Samuel Lipman, publisher of the New Criterion, 'the Right 
voted with their feet.' Conservatives returned to moneymaking and Cold War 
strategies, straightened out their George Stubbs engravings of English 
thoroughbred horses on their office walls, and forgot about the whole matter. 
After all, they reasoned, how important is culture? 
</P>
<P>
"They made little connection between the decline of education and family values 
and a subsequent rise in the crime, drugs (and) violence destroying society 
with its nihilistic anti-Americanism. 
</P>
<P>
"Conservatives seemingly never read Mao Tse-tung on waging cultural war against 
the West. Such essays were prescribed reading for the Herbert 
Marcuse-generation of the 1960s, who now run our cultural institutions." 
</P>
<P>
It is not enough, then, to protest. Anger and outrage against the gross and 
blasphemous need to be channeled into a plan to recapture the culture. If the 
NEA is not defunded, it should be taken over and cleaned out, beginning with 
Chairman John Frohnmayer, extending to every review panel that passed on the 
disgusting art. And Bush and his Cabinet officers ought to order the junk 
outside the Cabinet departments dug up, put on the auction block and replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Why should we go abroad and be awed by the public art of once-great nations and 
have to return home to be embarrassed by the public art of the greatest nation 
on Earth?

IF THINGS ARE BAD, HOW SWEET CAN IT BE FOR BUSH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD REEVES, From Richard Reeves' syndicated column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Bush is going to be a one-term President. 
</P>
<P>
People will vote their pocketbooks in 1992, as they have in about 48 of the 50 
presidential elections we've had so far. 
</P>
<P>
If things are looking up, the ones who make the difference will stick with what 
they've got, which has been the Republicans for more than 10 years now. If 
things are bad, they'll change -- and put in a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
It looks as if things will be bad. The savings and loans are gone with a lot of 
our money. Real estate prices are collapsing, trapping sellers in their homes 
or forcing them to default. The cycle of mortgage foreclosures and no buyers 
will soon enough lead to bank failures around the country. 
</P>
<P>
A political analyst named Bush said in 1988 -- this was one of the true things 
he said -- that for the Democrats to do well, America has to do badly. That 
appears to be happening now in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Well, bad luck for Bush. He has been an extraordinarily lucky candidate and 
President up to now. But in 1992, a lot of voters will abandon him. That is not 
because they like Democrats, or any particular Democrat, all that well. Nor do 
they particularly like politics or government, either. 
</P>
<P>
But it is becoming obvious to almost everybody that this bunch of Republicans 
did not really want to stop what government does; they just wanted to control 
what it did or did not do. They did that and failed miserably at a lot of it.

HEAT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS RESULT IN INCREASED AWARENESS OF SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have followed the Heat for two years and over the past year, have seen 
tremendous changes take place. 
</P>
<P>
I have seen the crowds more than double in size, have seen a family atmosphere 
develop as well as an increase in enthusiasm for the team. 
</P>
<P>
I think these developments can be attributed to General Manager Jill Fracisco 
and her staff. A lack of dedication certainly would not result in such a 
positive change. 
</P>
<P>
Militello pointed out some valid methods of how to increase attendance and 
interest in the club, but the negative manner in which he expressed his ideas 
does anything but spark interest in the club or the sport of soccer.

HEAT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS RESULT IN INCREASED AWARENESS OF SOCCER

Thomas Militello's suggestions on how to promote soccer (Times, July 26) have a 
lot of strength behind them, but I would like to point out some of the programs 
that the Los Angeles Heat have been involved in to increase awareness of the 
sport in the past year: 
</P>
<P>
* The team donated time to an anti-drug program. It did over 100 school 
assemblies promoting "Soccer is a Kick, Drugs are a Drag." 
</P>
<P>
* It offered free clinics to club and American Youth Soccer Organization teams 
in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
* Press releases about the team are distributed to over 120 reporters, which 
has resulted in increased media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
* Ticket packages have been put together in an attempt to increase attendance 
at home games. 
</P>
<P>
This past year the team went through management changes and it wasn't until 
March when a new management team was in place. It led to a great loss of time 
in promoting the 1990 season. But our attendance has increased over 60% from 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
As for a public-address announcer, if you know of someone who loves and 
understands the game of soccer and can show enthusiasm over the microphone 
while still sounding professional, please send some references to us.

development company reported second-quarter income of $164.7 million, 
contrasted with a $5.9-million loss for the year-ago period. Revenue was up 26% 
to $1.15 billion, boosted largely by sale of the company's General Casualty 
subsidiary. Profit gains were registered by its title and mortgage insurance 
units, but soft pricing and a loss of $9 million from fire damage in the recent 
Santa Barbara-area disaster were blamed for lower profit in property and

THE RETURN OF THE GREAT TOMATO; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S BIG, IT'S RED AND IT TASTES GOOD TOO. SUN WORLD INTERNATIONAL'S NEW DIVINE 
RIPE IS A BREAKTHROUGH IN TOMATO TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No fruit or vegetable has been more maligned than the modern tomato. 
</P>
<P>
And with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
The wonderful varieties that were sold in farmers' markets and roadside stands 
are, for the most part, gone from today's grocery store. The rich flavor, deep 
color and juicy texture of the classic beefsteak are distant memories. 
</P>
<P>
But now a major breakthrough in tomato technology is occurring in Orange 
County. The season's inaugural harvest of Sun World International's DiVine Ripe 
began a few days ago on Irvine Ranch. This may be the finest tomato ever grown 
commercially. 
</P>
<P>
"Commercial tomato's flavor has traditionally been unacceptable," says David 
Marguleas, marketing vice president for Sun World. Durability and shelf life -- 
two attributes highly prized by growers -- are probably responsible for the 
tomato's decline in quality. The vast majority of fresh tomatoes is harvested 
green and treated with ethylene gas to hasten color development. Only a small 
percentage of the crop is actually vine-ripened. 
</P>
<P>
Sun World, one of the produce industry's most innovative firms, decided to 
change that. The Indio-based company began its search for tomato perfection in 
the late '70s. They discovered that Israeli researchers were in the initial 
stages of developing what was to become the patented DiVine Ripe seed. 
</P>
<P>
The original challenge facing the researchers was to isolate the exact 
constituents of superb tomato taste. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any instrument that will tell you whether a tomato's flavor is 
good or bad," said Yakov Ben-Zion, President of LSL Biotechnologies, Inc., in 
San Diego. (Under the current agreement, LSL conducts the research on DiVine 
Ripe while Sun World handles production and marketing of the fruit.) "It takes 
eight or nine painstaking years to develop a variety such as this." 
</P>
<P>
Good tomato flavor is achieved by balancing the levels of sugar and acidity in 
the fruit. Vine-ripened varieties are better than those picked green because 
the sugar levels are not cut short by an early harvest and are allowed to 
increase naturally. 
</P>
<P>
Having attained the preferred flavor elements, the scientists were faced with 
an equally difficult task: developing the proper firmness so that the tomatoes 
could withstand the rigors of shipping. 
</P>
<P>
"Vine-ripened is the way to go, but if you harvest at that stage of maturity 
(partially red) then there are great difficulties in shipping the fruit," said 
Marguleas. "Unless you can breed in the right amount of firmness, then all the 
flavor achievements are for naught because you can't get the tomatoes to 
market. Flavor and firmness are critical." 
</P>
<P>
Ben-Zion is quick to point out that a firm tomato is not necessarily a bad one. 
"You don't want the tomato so hard that it is like a rock," he says, "but it 
still must hold its texture (in the week or more required to reach supermarket 
shelves after harvest)." 
</P>
<P>
The decade of research tailored the DiVine Ripe to temperate climates such as 
Irvine's, which lacks extreme heat or wild temperature fluctuations. Orange 
County is not as unusual a choice as it may seem: The 65,000 acre Irvine Ranch 
has 10,000 acres designated as agricultural. "Southern California," Marguleas 
said, "is one of the best growing areas for tomatoes in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the success of the project is evident in the lush rows of five-foot-tall 
vines bulging with fruit. Workers cut and gently place the tomatoes in wooden 
crates lined with plastic bubble wrap. The tomatoes are then taken to a 
processing shed where the fruit is washed, sorted for size and color 
variations, adorned with a Sun World sticker and then packed for shipment. 
</P>
<P>
The name may look familiar because the trademarked tomato was briefly available 
twice in the past. In 1986 and again in 1988, Sun World distributed the 
forerunner of the current variety. But although customers acclaimed the tomato, 
the firm was not satisfied with the product. "The original DiVine Ripes were 
not as perfect as we hoped," says Marguleas. "One of the imperfections was that 
the tomato was (too) susceptible to cloud cover and it didn't color evenly." 
</P>
<P>
The original varieties were also damaged by insects native to other crops in 
the Irvine Ranch area, and yield per acre was disappointing. None of these 
problems are surprising: Tomatoes are notoriously difficult to grow 
commercially. "They had an awfully good tomato the first time around," says 
Richard G. Spezzano, produce vice president for The Vons Companies. "But they 
didn't get the consistency they were looking for." 
</P>
<P>
The harvest of DiVine Ripe will continue through October, when the growing area 
will be switched to Baja and other Mexican venues. By 1991, Sun World hopes to 
have year-round national distribution of its tomato. 
</P>
<P>
Sun World is not alone; a number of competitors are trying to develop a better 
tomato using biotechnology. Other, less genetically intense programs are also 
underway. The Vons Companies, according to Spezzano, are now offering a 
vine-ripened tomato for the second year. They do this by contracting 
wholesalers at the Los Angeles produce terminal each day to select the best 
tomatoes available in terms of size, firmness and taste. 
</P>
<P>
"The Vons' vine-ripened X-large," says Spezzano, "is a tomato we're quite proud 
of." He indicated that he would consider offering the new Sun World tomatoes at 
Vons as well. 
</P>
<P>
As for the DiVine Ripe -- this is only the beginning. "It doesn't end here," 
says Ben-Zion. "There is no end in the quest for perfection." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers can expect to see DiVine Ripe at gourmet or specialty stores in the 
next two weeks. National distribution in selected supermarket chains will begin 
in mid-August. Prices are expected to be between $1 and $2 per pound.

This year is the 100th anniversary of the invention of peanut butter, which was 
originally a health food, later became a grammar school treat and recently has 
made a comeback among adults for some unclear mixture of health food and 
nostalgia reasons. Between one thing and another, the Peanut Advisory Board 
reports that sales have doubled over the last 25 years. Americans eat more 
peanut butter than any other people in the world -- nearly four and a half 
12-ounce jars per person per year.

Porky Pumps Up 
</P>
<P>
Pork has had this image problem, so over the last 10 years breeders have 
created a New Pig for a leaner New Age, aiming for lower-fat porkers and 
providing them with carefully controlled diets. Even more credit, says 
University of Missouri Extension swine specialist Ron Bates, goes to butchers, 
who are trimming these leaner pigs more severely. A South Dakota State 
University researcher recently traveled around the country buying pork in 
big-city supermarkets and found that it averaged 44% less fat than the USDA 
reported in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that pigs are being raised leaner, meat processors want them 
to be larger because they want to give consumers the same-size cuts they did 10 
years ago, so today's pig is 20 pounds heavier. But that's solid muscle, pally. 
Go ahead, punch a pig in the stomach. Come on, give it your best shot.

The Garlic Smash, available in many gourmet stores, is a return to either the 
Stone Age or the '60s, a Totally Natural kitchen utensil consisting of a 
smooth, flattened stone and a circular wooden block. It makes a lot of sense, 
actually. Garlic presses give you garlic that is not exactly pureed but more or 
less riced. In a mortar you can pound garlic to a paste, but you spend a lot of 
time chasing the slippery cloves around with the pestle. Out on this block they 
can't get away, and you can rock the, well, rock around and squash them to 
garlic paste with surprising efficiency.

In Seattle, a company called EnvirOmints is selling chocolate wafers stamped 
with the images of six endangered wildlife species. The symbolism of eating an 
endangered animal is peculiar, but EnvirOmints promises to donate half its 
profits to environmental causes once its initial debt is erased.

Meanwhile, in Marin, Fantastic Tempura reports that it has reformulated its 
tempura batter mix with organically grown whole wheat, brown rice and corn 
flours and that its package is now printed on recycled board with non-polluting 
inks. When we dip our high-calorie, high-cholesterol shrimp in this tempura 
batter and deep-fry them in mass quantities of oil, we shall do so with 
consciences as clear as a summer sky.

"How can single gourmets meet other single connoisseurs?" asks the leaflet. 
"One answer is Gourmets &amp; Friends. This new service is designed to 
discreetly introduce single gourmets and other friends of good food 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Gourmets &amp; Friends, P.O. Box 11652, Houston, Tex. 77293, is intended, as 
the leaflet says, "to provide single gourmets with information needed to reach 
out to others for possible friendships, romance and business contacts." A fine

Natural snack sales rose 22% in 1989, reports "Progressive Grocer." Pretty 
good, since candy sales have taken five years to rise 19% per capita and soft

gallons of soft drinks and 19.7 pounds of candy a year.

Now that good-tasting tomatoes are back, turn to recipes that take advantage of

So-called "Italian" tomato sauce is as American as John Philip Sousa. He once 
composed a spaghetti recipe involving a sauce seasoned within an inch of its 
life and simmered for 5 1/2 hours. You can find that recipe in "The Stag Cook 
Book," a 1922 compilation "written for men by men," with contributions by such 
worthies as Rube Goldberg, Warren G. Harding and Booth Tarkington. 
</P>
<P>
We've been eating thick, pungent sauces like Sousa's ever since the Depression, 
when spaghetti joints became fixtures in every sizable town. Visiting Italians 
are often known to wonder whether we're crazy. It's not that they don't make 
tomato sauce in Italy. It's just that they have other ideas about how to handle 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing can stop me from occasionally tackling a plate of spaghetti and 
meatballs drowned in one of those heavy, cooked-to-a-fare-thee-well sauces. But 
I would never make any such sauce out of scarlet garden tomatoes in August and 
September. Long cooking destroys their lovely late-summer immediacy. Sauces 
from fresh seasonal tomatoes should taste like fresh seasonal tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
There are literally dozens of ways to turn any harvest of tomatoes into good 
sauce: thick or thin, chunky or smooth, lightly or heavily seasoned, uncooked 
or cooked. Most parts of Italy have versions that are simmered for just a short 
time -- 15 to 20 minutes at most. 
</P>
<P>
The easiest and most summer-tasting sauce of all doesn't even need cooking. For 
this sauce, the tomatoes are invariably peeled and seeded. It doesn't matter if 
the sauce is soupy as long as the tomatoes are the real McCoy. The tomatoes 
must have absolutely full, vivid, first-class flavor, for there's nothing in 
the simple seasonings or the cooking to mask insipidity. Incidentally, if you 
can possibly avoid it, never refrigerate tomatoes; it dulls their flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Don't believe recipes that say canned tomatoes will do for these delicate 
sauces. They are best served with small, thin pasta shapes such as angel hair, 
vermicelli or thin-cut egg pasta, and they should be made in small batches and 
used quickly. Like all tomato sauces, they should be cooked in non-aluminum 
saucepans because the acid in the fruit reacts with aluminum to produce 
discoloration and a metallic off-flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The larger family of sauces that simmer somewhat longer -- anywhere from 40 
minutes to an hour -- have a little more body and a richer amalgamation of 
flavors. The first step in many of these tomato sauces is preparing a kind of 
flavor underpinning in the form of finely chopped aromatic vegetables such as 
onions, carrots and celery sauteed in olive oil, butter or a small amount of 
fat like that rendered from prosciutto. 
</P>
<P>
Cut-up tomatoes are then added -- skins, seeds and all, if the sauce is to be 
pureed after cooking; peeled and seeded if it is to be served as is. Canned 
tomatoes are never as vivid in flavor as peak-season fresh ones, but for 
longer-simmered sauces they will do better than the expensive excuses for fresh 
tomatoes found in most stores after the season has ended. 
</P>
<P>
A longer-cooked sauce suits the thick, stubby varieties of pasta or hollow 
shapes such as rigatoni better than the uncooked or lightly cooked sauces. It 
should not be reduced to as thick a consistency as many Americans expect. On 
the other hand, it is meant to be ristretta (concentrated) and bene addensata 
(well-thickened) -- enough to coat pasta more luxuriously than the fresh 
sauces. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the amazing variations in flavor and, especially, juiciness that 
fresh seasonal tomatoes exhibit from region to region, season to season, and 
variety to variety, there can be no exact rule on how long to cook them. There 
is also no hard and fast rule saying Italian plum tomatoes are better than 
American globe tomatoes; both have their advantages and disadvantages. 
</P>
<P>
In general, juicy tomatoes have more flavor than meaty ones; they do, however, 
take more cooking to achieve the body many people want in a sauce. More cooking 
means a more cooked flavor -- good for some sauces, all wrong for others. 
</P>
<P>
Making tomato sauce always means playing off the claims of flavor -- which 
comes more from the juice than the pulp -- against the claims of that bene 
addensata consistency. I have a strong prejudice on this subject: Gloriously 
slurpy tomatoes give unsurpassed flavor to all sauces, over-liquid or not. On 
the other hand, I find the so-called "meaty" tomatoes uninteresting in taste. 
</P>
<P>
The moral: evaluate every batch of tomatoes before you start cooking. To do 
this, peel and seed a few tomatoes and either measure or roughly estimate how 
much juice you are getting. Two parts of pulp to one or more of liquid is 
extremely juicy. Six parts pulp to one part liquid is very dry. 
</P>
<P>
If the tomatoes are soupy, you had better reserve some of the liquid and add it 
to the sauce as you see fit during cooking. (Any that isn't used makes a fine 
addition to other sauces and soups.) All sauces will thicken faster when cooked 
in wide, shallow pans to promote evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
When tomatoes don't have much juice, the problem is not an over-thin sauce but 
often one that tastes uninspiring. Fiddle as necessary with the seasonings, but 
unless the tomatoes are absolutely hopeless, your aim should be to boost their 
flavor rather than administer artificial resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
Between one teaspoon and two tablespoons of canned tomato paste enlivens dull 
tomatoes, but don't use it routinely on good ones; it overpowers them. A little 
salt also helps bring out tomato flavor. A mild, flavorful vinegar can jazz 
things up a bit; so can using shallots instead of onions. 
</P>
<P>
Acidity -- something many people complain about with both globe and plum 
tomatoes -- can be offset in all sauces if you add a tiny dash of sugar or 
increase the amount of carrot and onion in recipes calling for them. A 
tablespoon or two of olive oil stirred in at the end helps smooth out a 
slightly harsh taste. 
</P>
<P>
The recipes that follow, arranged from least to longest cooked, don't come 
close to exhausting the repertoire of tomato sauce possibilities in Italy, to 
say nothing of the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
A complete head count would have to include things such as the peppery 
hazelnut-tomato romesco of Spain, a mishmash of Southeast Asian dipping sauces, 
some Mexican salsas, the wonderful cold (but fiery hot) tomato sauce described 
in George Lang's "The Cuisine of Hungary," the rich tomato jams in some North 
African meat dishes and some new inventions using sun-dried tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
I think, though, that the continent hopping that took tomatoes from Central 
America to Italy and eventually returned the results to America have produced 
about as much happiness as any lucky accident in history. Given a bushel of 
these tomatoes at their dead-ripe, fire-engine-red summer best, the following 
recipes are what I'd first think of doing with them after I'd eaten half a 
dozen out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
To Peel and Seed Tomatoes: Immerse tomatoes in boiling water for 15 to 20 
seconds to loosen the skins, then peel. Cut the peeled tomatoes in half 
crosswise, squeeze out the contents of the seed chambers over a bowl and 
roughly chop the pulp. (This boiling-water method tends to remove the 
extra-tasty layer of pulp just under the skin, but you can salvage some of the 
flavor by wringing out the peels a fistful at a time.) 
</P>
<P>
A Note on Amounts: Usually 2 cups of sauce will do for 1 pound of pasta, but 
not always. For uncooked sauce, which is more delicate than cooked, count on at 
least 3 cups per pound of pasta. Rich, long-simmered sauces can be served in 
ratios of 1 1/2 cups per pound of pasta. Most of the following recipes are for 
larger amounts, yielding leftovers for future use. All freeze well except the 
uncooked sauce; to keep that one -- at some sacrifice of flavor -- freeze the 
fresh pulp by itself and add the garlic and onion after thawing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh, simple sauces go with thin pasta shapes. Don't try to make them with 
anything less than ripe tomatoes. If the tomatoes are very juicy, add a few 
more than are called for and drain off some of the liquid. 
</P>
<P>
UNCOOKED TOMATO SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
1 small onion 
</P>
<P>
1 medium clove garlic 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 to 2 pounds ripe tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
2 to 4 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
1 to 3 teaspoons balsamic vinegar or lemon juice, optional 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Cooked angel hair pasta 
</P>
<P>
Chopped fresh basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
Mince together onion and garlic. Peel, seed and coarsely chop tomatoes. Place 
onion, garlic and tomatoes in bowl along with 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil. Add 
more olive oil and balsamic vinegar, if desired. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Let stand unrefrigerated 1 to 4 hours. Serve with cooked angel hair pasta, 
sprinkling few chopped basil leaves over each portion. Makes about 3 cups thin 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 This sauce is best used at once, but it can be made up to two days ahead, 
refrigerated and reheated a few minutes before serving. In that case, or if the 
sauce is to be frozen, do not add basil until the sauce is reheated. 
</P>
<P>
QUICK-COOKING TOMATO SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds ripe tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
1 large clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
12 leaves fresh basil, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Cooked vermicelli, spaghettini or other thin pasta 
</P>
<P>
Peel, seed and chop tomatoes. Lightly drain if tomatoes seem watery. 
</P>
<P>
Heat olive oil in wide, shallow non-aluminum pan over medium heat. Saute garlic 
until tender. Add tomatoes and basil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Bring to boil and cook briskly, uncovered, 10 to 15 minutes, occasionally 
stirring and crushing tomatoes with wooden spoon. Sauce should be just slightly 
thickened. Serve with vermicelli. Makes about 2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 The nomenclature of Italian sauces often puzzles Americans. It is usual to 
mention the name of the pasta and add "with," or "in the style of," some 
identifying element in the sauce or its place of origin. A well-known Roman 
dish is penne (quill-shaped pasta) all'arrabbiata ("fighting-mad style"), made 
with a quick-cooking tomato sauce laced with hot peppers. The degree of heat 
can be varied to taste, but this sauce is not supposed to be thermonuclear. 
</P>
<P>
"FIGHTING MAD" SAUCE FOR PENNE 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons olive oil or mixture of olive oil and butter 
</P>
<P>
3 large cloves garlic, quartered or lightly crushed 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped, or 1 (28-ounce) can whole 
tomatoes, undrained 
</P>
<P>
2 to 3 small, dried hot red chiles, crushed and seeded or 1/2 teaspoon red 
pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
Fresh basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Cooked pasta 
</P>
<P>
Freshly grated Romano cheese, preferably imported Italian pecorino Romano or 
imported Parmesan 
</P>
<P>
Heat olive oil in large, wide, non-aluminum skillet over medium heat until not 
quite smoking. Quickly brown garlic, then remove cloves with slotted spoon. Add 
tomatoes, chiles and few torn basil leaves. Season lightly with salt and 
pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Bring to boil and simmer, uncovered, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring frequently and 
crushing tomatoes with wooden spoon. (Sauce should be just lightly thickened 
but still loose enough to slurp nicely into hollows of pasta.) 
</P>
<P>
Just before serving, toss together sauce and pasta with 2 to 4 tablespoons 
freshly grated Romano cheese. Garnish with basil leaves and pass more grated 
Romano at table. Makes 2 to 3 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 This sauce is loosely adapted from a recipe for basic tomato sauce in the 
Italian kitchen bible, Ada Boni's "Il Talismano della Felicita" ("The Talisman 
of Happiness"), a wonderful book that has never received a good English 
translation. Note the chopped mixture of aromatic vegetables and herbs or 
odori, which is characteristic of much Italian cooking. 
</P>
<P>
SIMPLE TOMATO SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
4 pounds unpeeled tomatoes, coarsely cut up, or 2 (28-ounce) cans whole 
tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
1 medium onion 
</P>
<P>
1 large carrot 
</P>
<P>
1 large celery stalk with leaves 
</P>
<P>
Small handful fresh parsley leaves 
</P>
<P>
8 to 10 fresh basil leaves or dash dried oregano 
</P>
<P>
4 to 6 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Lightly drain tomatoes if they seem watery. Finely chop together onion, carrot, 
celery, parsley and basil. Heat olive oil in large, wide non-aluminum saucepan 
over medium heat. Add tomatoes and chopped vegetables. Cover and simmer about 
30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Increase heat and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, another 10 to 15 
minutes (or longer as needed) until sauce is slightly concentrated. Puree using 
food mill or food processor. Return sauce to heat. Season to taste with salt 
and pepper and let simmer few more minutes. Makes about 1 quart, depending on 
amount of juice in tomatoes and rapidity of evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Translators gnash their teeth over "sugo," which can mean anything from "sap" 
to "pithy idea." Applied to sauces, it usually, but not always, indicates 
something infused with rich meat juices. The point of "finto" ("false," "mock") 
is that you are supposed to get a fine meaty flavor without the expense of 
using fresh meat. This recipe is another adaptation from Ada Boni. 
</P>
<P>
SUGO FINTO (Mock Meat Sauce) 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped, or 1 (28-ounce) 
can whole tomatoes, undrained 
</P>
<P>
1 medium carrot 
</P>
<P>
1 medium onion 
</P>
<P>
1 medium stalk celery 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon olive oil or butter 
</P>
<P>
2 ounces pancetta or prosciutto fat or salt pork 
</P>
<P>
1 large clove garlic 
</P>
<P>
Small handful parsley leaves 
</P>
<P>
1 to 1 1/2 cups water, white wine or juice reserved from tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
Large dash dried oregano, optional 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Drain tomatoes in colander over bowl. Chop together carrot, onion and celery 
very fine or coarsely puree in food processor. Heat olive oil in wide, shallow 
non-aluminum pan over medium heat. Gently saute carrot, onion and celery until 
fragrant and tender. 
</P>
<P>
Mince pancetta with garlic and parsley until almost paste. Or process mixture 
to coarse paste in food processor. Add mixture to vegetables. Cook over low 
heat, uncovered, stirring frequently. After few minutes, as fat begins to 
render out of meat, add few tablespoons water to juice and let boil away. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually add remaining water, few tablespoons at time, simmering 10 to 15 
minutes longer or until liquid has been absorbed and vegetables are soft paste. 
(Aim is to let flavors infuse while ingredients lightly braise without 
scorching.) 
</P>
<P>
Add tomatoes and oregano. Simmer, uncovered, 20 to 30 minutes, occasionally 
stirring and crushing tomatoes with wooden spoon, until sauce has good 
consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Makes about 2 1/2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 All sauce-makers who have handled first-class American globe tomatoes at the 
peak of ripeness know that these tomatoes really want to be soup. So, on 
occasion, do American plum tomatoes. Many years ago I paused in the middle of 
cursing my too-liquid sauce and said, "Why not?" and served it as tomato soup 
-- the best I'd ever eaten. Proportions are unimportant as long as the tomatoes 
are the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
FRESH TOMATO SOUP 
</P>
<P>
3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil plus additional for flavoring 
</P>
<P>
3 medium onions or 1 large, chopped, or 3 to 4 large shallots, minced 
</P>
<P>
4 medium or 2 large cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
5 pounds very ripe tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Large dash dried oregano or marjoram or small sprig fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon balsamic or other mild vinegar or to taste, optional 
</P>
<P>
Dash sugar, optional 
</P>
<P>
Heat 3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil in large, non-aluminum saucepan over medium 
heat. Saute onions and garlic 7 to 8 minutes or until tender and translucent. 
Cut unpeeled tomatoes into quarters or eighths and add to pan. Cover and simmer 
over low to medium heat about 5 minutes or until tomatoes begin to give off 
their juice. 
</P>
<P>
Increase heat slightly and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until 
tomatoes are completely tender and swimming in own juice, about 15 to 45 
minutes, depending on quantity and how crowded pan is. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully put soup through food mill. Force through as much tomato mixture as 
possible. (Alternatively, tomatoes can be pureed in batches in food processor, 
but texture will not be as good.) 
</P>
<P>
Return pureed tomatoes to pan and bring to simmer. Season to taste with salt, 
pepper and oregano. Simmer 5 to 10 minutes to amalgamate flavors. Taste to 
adjust seasonings. If bland, add balsamic vinegar or other mild, rich-tasting 
vinegar. If necessary, take off any acidic edge with dash of sugar and whisk in 
another 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil just before serving. Makes 2 quarts or 6 
to 8 servings.

<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: Would you have a recipe for the barbecue pork that is served in 
Chinese restaurants? 
</P>
<P>
 -- MRS. C.G. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MRS. C.G.: We do. 
</P>
<P>
The surface red color is developed from the catsup used in combination with soy 
and hoisin sauces. The pork is a staple for soups, stir-fry dishes, as well, a 
filling for steam buns. 
</P>
<P>
CHINESE BARBECUE PORK 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds boneless center-cut pork loin 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 tablespoons rice wine 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon catsup 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
Remove most of fat and gristle from pork loin and discard. Cut meat with grain 
into strips about 3 inches thick. 
</P>
<P>
Place meat in mixing bowl. Combine hoisin and soy sauces, rice wine, sugar, 
salt, catsup and garlic. Add soy mixture to meat in bowl and let marinate 4 
hours or overnight in refrigerator, turning occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange meat strips on rack in roasting pan and roast at 375 degrees 45 minutes 
or until pork is cooked inside and outside is brown. Cool slightly, then slice. 
Makes about 2 pounds.

THE GREAT TOMATO; 
</P>
<P>
HOT DAYS OF AUGUST BRING THE PICK OF VEGETABLE CROPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIMMY SCHMIDT, Schmidt is chef-proprietor of the Rattlesnake Club in 
Detroit. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
July is hot; August is hotter. What we get from all this heat are the most 
magnificent vegetables of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
This is the time of year when a vegetable's biochemical activity is in full 
swing. The ripening process -- achieved mostly by enzymatic actions -- converts 
the vegetable starch into sugar as the cell walls soften. Scent and flavor 
develop in the process, too. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, eggplants, tomatoes and peppers come alive in the heat with 
intense flavors and vibrant colors. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the good it does, the August heat can also lead to overripe and 
overdeveloped vegetables. Overripe vegetables turn mushy; overdeveloped 
vegetables appear wonderfully large but the flavors are usually diminished. 
That's why it's important to watch your garden carefully: larger vegetables 
grow very quickly, with weight gains of up to 20 ounces a day. The saying that 
you can hear the corn growing in August is not that far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
Pick your vegetables in the early morning, while temperatures are still cool; 
if it is hot, refrigerate them immediately, uncovered. The cold refrigerator 
will slow the biochemical activities. The picked vegetables are still alive, so 
make sure they get enough air when they're being stored. 
</P>
<P>
GRILLED EGGPLANT AND TOMATO SALAD 
</P>
<P>
1 large eggplant 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup kosher salt 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Black pepper 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1 large sweet red pepper, roasted, peeled and seeded 
</P>
<P>
1 small jalapeno chile, roasted, peeled and seeded, optional 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
2 ears white corn 
</P>
<P>
1 large red tomato, cut into 4 slices 
</P>
<P>
1 large yellow tomato (or another red tomato), cut into 4 slices (or substitute 
another red tomato) 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup fresh-picked cilantro leaves 
</P>
<P>
Peel eggplant and slice 1/2-inch thick. Sprinkle all surfaces of eggplant with 
kosher salt and place in colander. Allow salt to draw out moisture 1 hour. 
Rinse off eggplant slices under cold running water and pat dry with paper 
towels. Rub eggplant with 1/2 cup olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
Place eggplant on grill over hot coals, searing well, about 4 minutes. Turn 
over and cook until tender, about 4 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Cut eggplant slices into 8 (5x3-inch) pieces. Transfer to dish. Season to taste 
with black pepper and cumin. Add 1/2 cup olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
Combine vinegar and roasted red pepper in blender and puree until smooth. 
Slowly add remaining 1/2 cup olive oil. Add roasted jalapeno chile and season 
to taste with plain salt. 
</P>
<P>
Blanch corn in boiling water 4 minutes, then drain. Cut kernels from cob and 
season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
To assemble each individual serving, arrange 1 piece eggplant on each plate. 
Top with 1 slice red tomato, then another piece eggplant. Top with yellow (or 
red) tomato slice. Spoon pepper sauce around eggplant and tomatoes. Scatter 
corn over sauce. Sprinkle cilantro across eggplant and tomatoes. Makes 4 
servings.

'JAPANING' OF EUROPE AT FULL TILT; 
</P>
<P>
COMPANIES RUSH FOR A FOOTHOLD BEFORE THE 1992 INTEGRATION OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITY. ALSACE IS A CASE IN POINT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
RIBEAUVILLE, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story begins with life falling to pieces for an expatriate Japanese 
businessman in Dusseldorf. His small trading company goes kaput. His wife 
abandons him, taking their 10-year-old daughter back to Tokyo and leaving him 
and the family dog behind. 
</P>
<P>
The man then ventures off on an aimless drive through the German countryside 
and strays across the border into France, where the heavy hand of fate 
intervenes. He crashes his car into a haystack in a tiny Alsatian village with 
the imponderable name of Niedermorschwihr. 
</P>
<P>
There, amid the half-timbered medieval houses, this fugitive from Japan's 
economic front lines falls in love with a pretty Japanese art student, who 
happens to be staying in the village. 
</P>
<P>
So goes the plot of "The Blue Skies of Alsace," a television series that aired 
in Japan in late 1985. Ratings were lackluster, but the show marked the 
beginning of a Japanese infatuation with this picturesque region in 
northeastern France. The tourists started coming, followed by a rapid and 
remarkable influx of Japanese capital into the industrial base of Alsace. 
</P>
<P>
Sony made the first move. Lured here by a local development agency chief with a 
Japan vision, Sony chose the vineyard town of Ribeauville to construct a 
sprawling high-tech factory that makes videocassette recorders, compact disc 
players and 8-millimeter camcorders, and now employs more than 1,000 Alsatians. 
</P>
<P>
Other big manufacturers like Yamaha and Ricoh, and even some small 
electronic-component makers, have since arrived. Japanese restaurants cropped 
up in the cities of Colmar and Strasbourg. A Japan-Alsace Friendship Society 
was born. And an idle local convent was resurrected as a Japanese boarding 
school, its chapel converted into a kendo martial arts hall. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden "Japaning" of Alsace is part of a process being repeated in one 
fashion or another in regions scattered all across Europe these days, from the 
rust pockets of England to resurgent and soon-to-be-reunified Berlin. Direct 
investment is booming as Japanese companies scramble to get into position by 
1992, when the 12 nations belonging to the European Community will integrate 
themselves into a single market of 320 million consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The fear is that the new Common Market has the potential to become a "fortress 
Europe" that might make a habit of imposing anti-dumping duties or otherwise 
crimping imports from Japan. To get around that, the basic Japanese strategy is 
to establish a foothold inside the ramparts in the next two years and enjoy the 
EC's privileges of free trade. 
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, the number of Japanese manufacturers with operations in Europe 
leaped by 22% to a total of 529 companies, according to a survey by the Japan 
External Trade Organization. Statistics from the Finance Ministry in Tokyo show 
that during the fiscal year that ended March 31, Japan invested $14.8 billion 
in Europe -- representing about one-third the cumulative total of all of its 
investment in the region since 1951. 
</P>
<P>
The scale is still relatively small compared to investment from the United 
States, which has been pumping capital into Europe for decades. In Britain, 
target of more than a third of Japan's European investment to date, Americans 
own about 3,000 manufacturing enterprises. The Japanese have 130. 
</P>
<P>
But the intensity of Japan's pre-1992 stampede to Europe appears to be arousing 
suspicions that a scheme of economic conquest is in the works -- much in the 
same terms that the specter of U.S. economic domination was viewed from this 
side of the Atlantic some 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The French have been the most vitriolic in sounding the alarm, even though 
France ranks second among Common Market countries (after Britain) in hosting 
Japanese plants, and even though local development agencies -- like the one in 
Alsace -- are bending over backward to woo further investment. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing nervous industrialists, the French news media are making statements 
such as "The Japanese Are Killers." That was the headline of a Jan. 12 cover 
story in the reputable journal Le Nouvel Economiste, which went on to 
characterize Japan's corporations as predators bent on destroying Occidental 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Another French publication, Challenges, which bills itself as "the most 
European of economic magazines," published a special issue in June titled: 
"Japan: The Secrets of the New Masters of the World." 
</P>
<P>
French officialdom has helped stain the atmosphere with a little hyperbole of 
its own, particularly where the automobile industry is concerned and especially 
when Edith Cresson, the razor-tongued Cabinet minister in charge of European 
affairs, is speaking. In an interview with a Los Angeles Times reporter last 
year, for example, she compared the Japanese to "ants." 
</P>
<P>
In Alsace, however, outright Japan-bashing has not been conspicuous -- yet. 
Perhaps the strongest sign of tension so far was when the regional newspaper 
L'Alsace reported earlier this year that "the Japanese" had bought the 
Haut-Landsberg castle, a government-protected historic landmark. The article 
was published on April Fool's Day, and most readers are assumed to have gotten 
the joke. 
</P>
<P>
Lest any suspicions linger, though, Sony has faithfully carried out its policy 
of "localizing" operations at the Ribeauville plant, its third manufacturing 
facility in France and now its second-largest in Europe after a television 
factory in Wales. The plant manager here is a Frenchman -- hired away from 
Motorola -- and he vaguely outranks the sole Japanese executive at the site. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not invaders," said Yasuya Takaura, the so-called No. 2 man who also 
carries the title of "senior general manager in charge of audio-video 
manufacturing" for Sony Europa GmbH, the parent company of Sony France SA. 
"This is a French factory, a European factory. That is our policy." 
</P>
<P>
For Takaura, who supervised the team of technicians that invented the Sony 
Walkman in the late 1970s, the assignment in Ribeauville is a bittersweet one. 
Like the hero of the "Blue Skies" television drama, he is separated -- but 
amicably -- from his wife, who remains in Japan with his children. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he confesses to enjoying the good life here. In a corner of his office 
sits a hefty set of golf clubs, which he lugs along on business trips to 
Switzerland and Germany. The portly engineer also has acquired a taste for 
Alsatian cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
"My middle name is foie gras," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Tournet, Sony France SA's plant manager, said he is struck with deja vu 
whenever he hears complaints about Japan's threat to French industry. 
</P>
<P>
Tournet recalled that he was just out of college and job hunting 21 years ago 
when "The American Challenge," by French journalist Jean Jacques 
Servan-Schreiber, became a best seller. The controversial book warned of a U.S. 
"assault on Europe" and reasoned that America's competitive advantage was in 
its system of business management, not in superior technology. Tournet started 
his career with an American multinational. 
</P>
<P>
Now he does things the Japanese way, right down to the gasoline station-style 
uniform jacket he wears over his executive dress shirt and tie. He takes great 
pride in the factory's quality performance, one of those American management 
concepts the Japanese perfected. His plant currently stamps out CD players at a 
rate of more than 1.1 million units a year, and it is expanding. By the end of 
1990 Sony will have made a cumulative investment of $90 million in Ribeauville 
and have 1,200 workers on Tournet's payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Sales are roughly doubling annually, Tournet noted, while pointing to a map of 
greater Europe with Alsace at its exact center. 
</P>
<P>
"We are right on the spot, at the heart, especially now with the opening of 
Eastern Europe," Tournet said. "We have 200 million potential customers within 
a 500-kilometer (310-mile) radius, and our aim is to be as close as possible to 
them so we know what their needs are." 
</P>
<P>
Sony's venture in Alsace -- called a "greenfield" investment in the jargon 
because the company acquired a patch of ground and built from scratch instead 
of buying an up-and-running concern -- represents a recent trend that was oddly 
allegorized in the "Blue Skies of Alsace" story. 
</P>
<P>
More and more companies are choosing to venture off into uncharted territory in 
Europe, as opposed to clustering in well-established Japanese enclaves. 
Dusseldorf, from whence the fictional bankrupt trader came, is one such 
enclave, as are London and Wales. 
</P>
<P>
But it should be noted that the "Blue Skies" scriptwriter's choice of 
Niedermorschwihr as a site for the crash into the haystack was no accident. 
That was engineered by the same man who brought Sony to Ribeauville: Andre 
Klein, director of the Alsace Development Agency, who might be described as the 
impresario of most Alsace-Japan connections. 
</P>
<P>
Klein opened a branch office in Tokyo in 1982 -- an aggressive move that 
provoked the ire of Datar, the central government's commercial service, because 
Alsace was not classified as underdeveloped or having high unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
There were no tax incentives to dole out. All Alsace had to offer was a 
diligent work force, the "Germans among the French." (Alsace and neighboring 
Lorraine have been hotly contested in modern wars and forced to switch 
sovereignty several times, leading to another Alsatian virtue: adaptability.) 
</P>
<P>
"We have a traditional relationship to the Germans and the Swiss -- it shows in 
work well done, our social consensus and reliability," Klein said. "Our wages 
are also 20% to 25% lower than in Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Klein's logic eventually worked on Sony, whose European operations have their 
headquarters in Cologne and are run by a Swiss chief executive. Klein did a few 
other smart things, too. He sent his son to Japan for the summer, and the 
Japanese consultant who runs the agency's Tokyo office placed the younger Klein 
in an internship with Fuji Television -- which happened to be looking for a 
European location for its new adventure-drama series. 
</P>
<P>
Klein also invited a reporter from Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's top economic 
newspaper, to visit Alsace and persuaded him to write a story about an empty 
convent in the medieval village of Kientzheim that might make an ideal campus 
for a Japanese prep school. A dozen schools saw the article and contacted 
Klein. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Tokyo's prestigious Seijo Gakuen, an institution that educates 
free-thinking Japanese from kindergarten through university, opened its first 
overseas branch at the site, Lycee Seijo d'Alsace. Enrolled are 180 junior high 
and high school students, about two-thirds of whom are children of Japanese 
expatriates in the vicinity or in Europe, Africa, Australia or the Soviet 
Union. The rest come from Japan for an "international experience." 
</P>
<P>
The curriculum is all in Japanese and exactly the same as at Seijo's head 
campus in Tokyo, and that's the point, said headmaster Jokichi Moroga. 
</P>
<P>
The deepest anxiety of overseas Japanese is the vexing problem of how to 
properly educate their children so that they can pass the highly competitive 
entrance examinations at elite Japanese universities. Seijo gets around that by 
offering a feeder system to its distinguished college. Similar programs are 
operated by private Japanese schools in London and New York. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a little Japan, like a desert island," Moroga said. "There's no 
problem as long as they're here. But culture shock sets in during vacations, 
when they go to be with their parents in Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Lycee Seijo students have some exposure to French children during sports 
exchanges, but on the whole they remain isolated at the former convent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of fun, but there are some drawbacks," said Gosuke Kubo, 18, son of 
a steel merchant from Kobe. "Like, I've been here for four years and I can't 
speak any French."

DIVIDED SENATE APPROVES CAMPAIGN FINANCE CURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate, bitterly divided along party lines, approved a broad overhaul of 
campaign finance laws Wednesday night after voting to bar senators from 
accepting outside speaking fees known as honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic-sponsored measure, adopted by a vote of 59 to 40, is aimed at 
cutting the soaring cost of Senate campaigns and the growing use of special 
interest money in them. 
</P>
<P>
"The President certainly will veto a bill in this form, and I'm sure a veto 
will stand up," said Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). 
</P>
<P>
The legislation calls for voluntary spending limits that would vary according 
to a state's size. Candidates who accepted the limits would be rewarded with 
taxpayer-funded broadcast subsidies, mail discounts and -- if an opponent 
rejected the limits -- direct cash infusions. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also would outlaw political action committees, or PACs, the 
much-criticized money-giving arms of business, labor and other special interest 
groups. In addition, the measure would restrict "soft money" and "bundling," 
two practices widely used to get around existing federal limits on campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Soft money refers to contributions made to state parties but spent on federal 
campaigns and exempt from federal restrictions. Bundling refers to a method by 
which interest groups evade the $10,000 limit on PAC contributions by gathering 
checks from individuals in the group and delivering them in a bundle. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is rapidly losing confidence in the federal election process," said 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). "It is clear we have gotten 
to the point that the worst alternative is to do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Senate Republicans sought a PAC ban and some limits on contributions 
from out of state, while favoring looser curbs on individual donations to 
political parties on the assumption that they are a healthier source of 
campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush and the Republicans strenuously objected to the Democratic measure, 
arguing that spending limits would boost the Democrats' hold on Congress and 
that public funding would further bloat the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
House Democratic leaders are expected to bring up a similar bill in that 
chamber Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-23 vote on an amendment to ban senators' honorariums reflected a growing 
sensitivity about ethics. But for the time being, the proposed ban may be more 
symbolic than real because of the dubious future of the campaign finance bill. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Senate leaders said a ban was inevitable. They indicated that 
they hoped to couple it with a pay raise for senators after the congressional 
elections in November. Such a move would bring the Senate in line with a ban on 
honorariums that goes into effect for the House and the executive branch on 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"The practice of accepting honoraria is fundamental to the continuing erosion 
of public trust in this representative democracy," Sen. Robert C. Byrd 
(D-W.Va.) said shortly before the Senate vote to ban the fees effective Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Senators accepted a total of $2.7 million in honorariums last year, keeping $2 
million of it to supplement their $89,500 salaries and donating the rest to 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
House members decided last November to stop accepting honorariums Jan. 1, 1991, 
in exchange for two hefty pay raises -- 7.9% this year and 25% next year, 
boosting representatives' salaries to $120,750. 
</P>
<P>
But senators, fearful of voter reaction against big pay increases, chose a 
different course last year. They elected to phase out their honorariums over 
several years as a 10% pay raise and cost-of-living adjustments took effect. 
Thus, senators' salaries are due to increase to about $100,000 on Jan. 1, while 
their honorarium limit drops to about $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, pressure to impose a total ban on senators' honorariums steadily has 
mounted over the last several months as the Senate Ethics Committee probed the 
conduct of seven senators and as outside groups criticized the influence of 
money in politics. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Senate formally denounced Minnesota Republican Dave Durenberger 
for cheating on honorarium limits, among other things. On that charge, he was 
ordered to make restitution of $95,000 plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Senate accepted the honorarium ban proposed by Sen. Christopher J. 
Dodd (D-Conn.), the issue stirred up a multitude of frustrations. As a result, 
the Senate immediately adopted, by 51 to 49, a Draconian amendment that was 
widely viewed as merely mischievous and unlikely to become law. 
</P>
<P>
That amendment, offered by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), called for 
limiting senators' outside income -- including dividends, interest, rents and 
capital gains -- to 15% of their official salary. 
</P>
<P>
Voting against it were most of the Senate's two dozen millionaires, including 
Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), John Heinz (R-Pa.), Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and 
Pete Wilson (R-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
"Some senators voted for the amendment on outside income because they don't 
like their honoraria being taken away, and they're worried they would be 
earning less than House members," explained a senator who requested anonymity. 
"Others were mad at the wealthy senators who don't understand why the rest of 
us need a pay raise. And others just wanted to add something that would help 
sink" the underlying campaign finance bill. 
</P>
<P>
In a floor statement, Moynihan said that he did not understand how the Senate 
could vote to limit outside earned income "while leaving untouched the large 
amount of unearned income based on accumulated capital and property . . . that 
is rather concentrated in this body." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I ask that in order that there be a level playing field, let 
everybody be a little equal in the Senate. It doesn't mean you have to have 
equal numbers of houses and cars, but income will be equal, earned or 
unearned." 
</P>
<P>
His amendment did not spell out what senators would have to do if their 
interest, dividends and other such income exceeded the 15% limitation. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd said that he had wanted to combine his honorarium ban with an offsetting 
pay raise, but was told by leaders that votes for a raise were lacking in this 
pre-election period. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment to ban honorariums was supported by 53 Democrats and 24 
Republicans, including Cranston and Wilson. It was opposed by 2 Democrats and 
21 Republicans.

HOSTAGES FREED, REBELS GIVE UP IN TRINIDAD 
</P>

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The five-day hostage crisis that devastated the capital city of Trinidad and 
Tobago ended Wednesday with the surrender of 112 black Muslim rebels who were 
holding 46 captives in two besieged downtown buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Minister of Planning Winston Dookeran, who led the government's negotiating 
team, said the hostage takers surrendered unconditionally and are being 
detained under heavy guard at the Teteron army barracks, 10 miles west of Port 
of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if the government had deceived the rebels into believing they would 
be pardoned and released, Dookeran evaded a direct answer and simply repeated 
his assertion that the capitulation was unconditional. 
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Gregory Shaw had earlier suggested that the rebels could 
face charges of treason and murder for crimes that included the bombing deaths 
of at least two policemen. But Dookeran, who was himself a hostage for the 
first day of the five-day ordeal, would go no further than to say that 
"appropriate charges will be laid after an investigation." 
</P>
<P>
"The government condemns this abhorrent crime," Dookeran said at a press 
conference late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dookeran announced that Parliamentary Secretary Leo Divine died of gunshot 
wounds to the leg, received during the violent takeover of the Parliament 
building. 
</P>
<P>
He added that ailing Prime Minister Arthur N. R. Robinson, who was released by 
the rebels on humanitarian grounds Tuesday, was hospitalized in good condition 
and "there is no intention for him to resign." 
</P>
<P>
But some rebels of the group known as Jaamat al Muslimeen insisted that the 
government had promised them amnesty and that they were to be allowed to return 
to their controversial religious commune just north of Port of Spain. They said 
part of their supposed deal included Robinson's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels, a number of whom appeared to be of East Indian descent, looked more 
like prisoners than pardoned men as they filed out at gunpoint, one at a time 
through a drenching tropical rain, to tightly guarded buses outside the 
Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT) building, where 29 of the hostages had 
been held. 
</P>
<P>
The leader of the attempted coup that led to the hostage taking, Yasin abu 
Bakr, was spread-eagled against the wall of a building near the TTT 
headquarters and searched before being prodded toward a bus. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Bakr, clad all in white and with hands clasped atop his head in surrender, 
smiled broadly and called "Allah is the greatest" to journalists. Earlier, he 
had walked out of the television building, placed his rifle in the street and 
then stood at attention as his followers came out singly at two-minute 
intervals, holding weapons over their heads. He submitted to a search only 
after all his followers had been searched first, face down on the concrete or 
up against a wall, and then loaded aboard the buses. 
</P>
<P>
A few hostage takers spoke to reporters from the windows of the buses that took 
them away, with one crying out, "We succeeded in our goal of exposing the 
corruption of this island." Several insisted that the government had promised 
to abide by an agreement to grant them full pardons, let them return to their 
homes at a Black Muslim enclave north of the capital and call elections in the 
near future to form a new government. 
</P>
<P>
Three hours later, as darkness settled over the no-man's land around Red House, 
the Parliament building where 17 top government officials had been held, the 
hostages there filed out singly, applauding with relief. 
</P>
<P>
Several, including Minister of National Security Selwyn Richardson, limped out 
of the Parliament building to a waiting panel truck. Richardson and Robinson 
had suffered gunshot wounds to the leg during the violent takeover last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although most hostages and all but three hostage takers appeared unhurt, there 
was no official word on their medical condition. The hostages were taken to the 
army's Camp Ogden for physical and psychological examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what development had led to the breakthrough Wednesday that ended the 
crisis, government spokesman Shaw replied, "I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said, "As far as the government is concerned, (the surrender) is 
unconditional. The hostage situation is over." 
</P>
<P>
As to what would now happen to the rebels, he said, "I know nothing about what 
their prospects or their future will be like." But he added that "they could be 
charged with treason and murder." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw insisted that the government had "made no agreement" with the rebels. 
During the past three days, there had been authoritative reports that an 
agreement detailing a staged release, as was finally achieved, had been at the 
heart of hostage negotiations and tentatively accepted by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Trinidadians interviewed during the hostage release expressed shock 
when they heard rebel claims that they had been promised amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
"Any agreement made under that kind of duress will not stand up legally and 
must not be honored," said Bonny Patrick, a Port of Spain businessman. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis began at 6:10 p.m. last Friday when the rebels drove an 
explosives-laden car into the enclosure of the country's central police 
station. The station was demolished and the policemen died when the car bomb 
exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Almost simultaneously, two groups of rebels assaulted the Parliament and 
television buildings, trapping the government officials, including the prime 
minister, employees of TTT and others. A handful of the captives in Red House 
were allowed to go free during the early hours of the siege. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with the hostage takers began early Saturday and were carried out 
mostly through the mediation of an Anglican clergyman, Rev. Knolly Clarke.

CONFEREES OK BILL ASSISTING AIDS PATIENTS

<P>
House and Senate negotiators announced an agreement Wednesday on new AIDS 
legislation that for the first time would provide significant federal 
assistance for the clinical care of AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990, named after 
the late Indiana teen-ager who crusaded against AIDS discrimination after he 
contracted the disease through treatment for hemophilia, is expected to quickly 
pass the House and Senate. The House may vote on the bill as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation authorizes the government to spend up to $875 million in the 
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 on four new AIDS programs that would help 
states, cities and private health care facilities diagnose and treat those who 
have the disease. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, most of the $1.7 billion that the Bush Administration is seeking 
for AIDS spending in the next fiscal year would be set aside for research and 
education. The Ryan White measure would provide funding over and above the 
Administration request. 
</P>
<P>
"Cities and states are struggling to keep their health systems from collapsing 
and they deserve federal aid," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), a member 
of the conference committee and co-author of the Senate version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that the federal government is directing money toward 
the whole range of services that go along with the care that is going to be 
needed," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), a member of the conference 
committee and author of the legislation passed by the House. 
</P>
<P>
"The most significant issue for the future of this epidemic is treatment," said 
Thomas B. Stoddard, executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and 
Education Fund, the nation's largest gay rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the most promising developments in the laboratory will have no 
significance if our health care systems can't deliver them to the people most 
in need," Stoddard said. "This bill at least begins to address that problem." 
</P>
<P>
Both the House and Senate earlier had approved by wide margins different 
versions of the AIDS relief measure, despite Administration opposition. Waxman 
said he believes that President Bush will sign the legislation because of the 
overwhelming support it has received in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
A White House official, who asked not to be identified, agreed that a veto is 
unlikely. However, the official said that Congress will be hard pressed to find 
all the money needed to pay for the programs authorized by the Ryan White 
legislation.

The "disaster relief" portion of the bill would provide up to $275 million in 
aid to those cities that have been hardest hit by the 10-year AIDS epidemic. As 
of June 30, more than 139,760 Americans had developed AIDS, and 85,430 had 
died. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for federal aid, a community would have to be in a metropolitan area 
with more than 2,000 reported cases of AIDS, or an incidence of at least 25 
AIDS cases per 10,000 people. West Coast cities that would be expected to 
receive grants under the program are Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A second program would authorize another $275 million in grants to states, 
using a formula based on the number of reported cases over the previous two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, $305 million would be set aside for grants to states or private 
clinics to provide early intervention services, including testing for the human 
immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, patient counseling and prescription of 
drugs that have been shown to delay the onset of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also would authorize $20 million for a special research project 
to benefit children with AIDS.

Republican Pete Wilson has out-banked Democrat Dianne Feinstein about 6 to 1 
going into their fall campaign for governor, but California's 2-year-old 
campaign finance reform law still puts enormous fund-raising demands on both 
candidates during the remaining three months of the contest. 
</P>
<P>
As of June 30, Wilson had $3.9 million cash on hand and Feinstein had $645,344, 
according to reports filed with the secretary of state's office. Wilson 
out-raised Feinstein by 2 to 1 during the latest reporting period, May 20-June 
30, and he had spent $5.4 million for the year even though he had no 
substantial opposition in the June primary. Feinstein, with a tough primary, 
spent $5.5 million in the first half of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson aides declined to say how much they have budgeted for the fall campaign, 
but campaign director Otto Bos said, "We are about $50,000 over our budget 
projections. We think we are very close to where we want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Feinstein campaign have said the former San Francisco mayor 
hoped to raise $10 million to $12 million for the fall stretch. To come near to 
that goal, her campaign would have to collect about $3 million a month from 
here on. She took in only about $1.5 million in the last six weeks, Feinstein 
told a press conference in Los Angeles on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for Feinstein was that she raised that much without relying on 
further loans from her husband, Richard Blum, a wealthy investment banker who 
advanced the Feinstein campaign about $3 million to help her defeat state Atty. 
Gen. John K. Van de Kamp in the June 5 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first statewide election being conducted under the restrictions of 
Proposition 73, an initiative approved narrowly by state voters over a rival 
campaign reform plan in 1988. A major provision of the law, sponsored by 
conservative Republican Assemblyman Ross Johnson from La Habra and independent 
Sen. Quentin Kopp of San Francisco, limits contributions and loans to campaigns 
from an individual to $1,000 for each fiscal year. There is no restriction on 
what a candidate can contribute or lend to his or her own campaign. 
</P>
<P>
With her treasury depleted by the primary battle, Feinstein spent most of the 
following four weeks out of public view, primarily talking to potential 
contributors. Wilson spent some of his reserve during that time on television 
ads that went unmatched by the Feinstein campaign. This strategy led some 
experts to conclude that Feinstein missed an opportunity to capitalize on the 
public exposure and momentum she got out of the primary victory. But the fiscal 
year calendar of the campaign finance law made it imperative that Feinstein 
raise as much money as possible before June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Until Proposition 73, there was no contribution limit on individuals or 
businesses. In the 1986 election for governor, incumbent Republican Gov. George 
Deukmejian raised more than $13 million. His unsuccessful opponent, Democratic 
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, collected a little more than $6 million. A 
single group, the Western Growers Political Action Committee, gave Deukmejian 
more than $100,000 in one two-month period in 1986, and Bradley had a number of 
contributions in the $10,000-$15,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73 has curbed the check-writing abilities of the big givers. But 
the reforms have not necessarily reined in the soaring cost of elections in 
California, or reduced the influence of a candidate's most trusted money men 
and women, veteran campaign officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Garrett, Feinstein's campaign chairman, explained it this way: "The 
$1,000 contributor becomes the sine qua non of the effort. Before, you didn't 
think of amounts. You did a lot of $500 events and you'd get $5,000 from a 
giver. . . . Now you have to make that kind of contributor into a fund-raiser. 
As a result, the take is down." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, instead of paying for a 10-place table and allowing the campaign to honor 
select friends or potential givers by seating them for free, the contributor 
now is asked to find nine friends or associates to write their own checks. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73 does not limit the total spending for a single office, and it 
prohibits public financing of campaigns. It also banned large in-kind 
contributions, a feature that bothers even the Wilson camp although the senator 
supported Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, it was common for law firms and accounting offices to lend talent 
to campaigns to handle the considerable legal and bookkeeping services required 
in running for election. Firms also lent planes and buses for candidate travel. 
During 1986, for example, the Bradley campaign received in-kind contributions 
valued at more than $62,000 from one law firm and $9,248 in copying machine 
services from two firms. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the biggest complaint is that it takes more bookkeepers and more 
attorneys," Bos said. "It drives up the cost of the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Bos also said Proposition 73 can discourage grass-roots campaigning. 
Businesses, labor unions and other organizations used to donate office space in 
California's smaller cities and towns for use as local campaign headquarters. 
But Bos said, "This doesn't happen much any more because you've got to pay up 
front. I'm not convinced that kind of reform is good reform." 
</P>
<P>
Most campaign veterans believe, however, that the greatest effect of 
Proposition 73 is to force candidates to spend much more time collecting money. 
One prominent Los Angeles fund-raiser who asked not to be quoted by name 
commented, "It's a total perversion of the process. The (1,000) dollar figure 
doesn't bear any relation to the cost of campaigning." 
</P>
<P>
The result is that the candidates have less time to spend in public discussing 
real campaign issues, added another political expert, Robert M. Stern, 
co-director of the California Commission on Campaign Financing. 
</P>

CAMPAIGN REPORTS 
</P>
<P>
 The following chart shows the amount of money raised by the major candidates 
for statewide office this year through June 30, as reported on their latest 
campaign reports. Also noted is the amount of cash that each candidate had on 
hand at the end of the reporting period, as they prepare for the fall general 
election. Several of the candidates, in the aftermath of bruising primary 
campaigns, reported substantial debts. The campaign reports were filed this 
week with the secretary of state's office in Sacramento.

MEDFLY MAY HAVE GAINED HOLD IN 1988; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: UC SCIENCE PANEL FINDS STATE FAILED TO ERADICATE WEST LOS ANGELES 
OUTBREAK. POSSIBILITY OF EARLIER ORIGINS STILL UNDER STUDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The current Medfly infestation in Southern California probably originated with 
a small West Los Angeles outbreak that agriculture officials failed to 
eradicate in 1988, a scientific panel reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The group of eight scientists, convened by the University of California to 
investigate Southern California's infestation, said the Medfly boom this year 
even may be linked to a single fly found in the same West Los Angeles 
neighborhood in 1987. Agriculture officials implemented no eradication efforts 
after that find. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists said the apparent failure to destroy the last vestiges of the 
Medfly in 1987 or 1988 allowed the pest to spread and multiply over hundreds of 
square miles in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley entomologist Robert A. Van Steenwyk, the panel's chairman, said his 
group could not decide if the current infestation traces its origin even 
further back. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the group expects to continue its work and, with the help of 
genetic analysis, may be able to resolve the controversial theory that the 
current infestation is actually an outgrowth of a Medfly infestation in 1975 or 
outbreaks in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"This initial report is what we feel comfortable with," Van Steenwyk said. "But 
this is not the end." 
</P>
<P>
The UC task force was formed in early March to resolve a furious dispute 
between state eradication officials and UC Davis entomologist James R. Carey, 
one of five scientists serving on the state's Medfly Science Advisory Panel. 
</P>
<P>
Carey proposed in March that the Medfly outbreaks in Southern California were 
not isolated introductions of the pest as the state maintained, but connected 
infestations that possibly stretched back to the 1975 outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
Carey claimed that the repeated trapping of Medflies in the same neighborhoods 
over the last 15 years suggested that past eradication efforts have not worked 
and that small colonies of Medflies have been able to breed undetected because 
of the state's porous fly trapping network. 
</P>
<P>
State officials maintained that each infestation was an isolated outbreak 
caused by immigrants or travelers who illegally brought infested fruit into the 
state. They argued that the Medfly breeds so quickly that even a tiny 
population could not escape discovery for long. 
</P>
<P>
Van Steenwyk said the UC report does not resolve the dispute, but does support 
parts of both views. 
</P>
<P>
Carey said the report "affirms my theory that these Medflies are not being 
eradicated. They've linked two or three years. That's a start." 
</P>
<P>
Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of Agriculture entomologist and chairman of 
the state's Medfly Science Advisory Panel, said he was satisfied with much of 
the report's conclusions, saying it backed up the state's contention that the 
current infestation did not originate in 1975 or the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the report, the UC panel also came up with a series of 
recommendations to improve the state's eradication program, including 
increasing research on Medfly breeding habits, fly-trapping efficiency and 
genetic analysis, which could be used to determine the origin of individual 
Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also recommended the creation of an independent committee to improve 
the use of sterile flies to eradicate the Medfly.

FEW FUME OVER NEW 5-CENT GAS TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's new gasoline tax went into effect Wednesday with few apparent 
hitches, drawing resigned grumbles from motorists as nearly 12,000 service 
stations across the state began collecting an extra nickel for each gallon of 
gas they sell. 
</P>
<P>
Spot reports from service stations and dealer associations throughout Southern 
California and the rest of the state indicated that most motorists came 
prepared to pay more for gas when they pulled up to the pumps throughout the 
day Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 111 -- a ballot initiative designed to use a 9-cent gas tax hike to 
ease traffic jams, repair worn freeways and bridges and pay for more public 
transportation -- was approved by 52% of the state's voters in June. After 
Wednesday's tax hike, a 1-cent increase will be added to the five-cent tax each 
year until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
There were scattered accounts of panic buying in the last hours before the tax 
went into effect at midnight Wednesday morning and reports that some dealers 
raised prices even higher than the 5-cent increase. And a few Los Angeles 
service stations angered motorists by raising prices two hours before the 
deadline fell. 
</P>
<P>
But at most service stations, drivers simply came up with the extra change -- 
whether they liked it or not. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we've heard, it was met by a well-prepped public," said Stephen R. 
Shelton, executive director of the Southern California Service Station Assn., 
which represents 1,900 stations. "People voted for it -- they should expect 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite repeated public warnings about the impending tax in recent weeks, 
there were some who arrived blissfully ignorant of the new prices. Mike Murphy, 
a 19-year-old college student who drove up to a Santa Barbara gas station to 
fill up his Toyota station wagon for a day of surfing, was startled by the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
"What tax?" he asked. Told that California voters had voted in favor of the 
measure to pay for transportation improvements, Murphy was still befuddled: 
"What vote?" 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a more detailed explanation was provided. "You mean the tax started 
this morning?" he asked. "Bummer. . . . I should have filled up last night." 
</P>
<P>
Many did, saving a few cents a gallon for a few minutes spent in gas lines 
reminiscent of those that lasted for hours during the oil crisis of 1973. In 
Ventura County, station owners and managers said business at their pumps 
increased more than 20% on Monday and Tuesday as people tried to get in their 
last tank of gas before the price change. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Cortez, manager of a Union 76 station near the Los Angeles Country 
Club, said that drivers lined up to save money on gas Tuesday night. "We sold 
8,000 gallons of gas," he said. "That's 500 more gallons than usual." 
</P>
<P>
Two hours before the deadline, drivers filling up at a Unocal station on 
Sherman Way in Van Nuys complained to Los Angeles police that they were forced 
to pay the nickel tax before it had officially started. 
</P>
<P>
A manager who represents independent Unocal dealers in the Los Angeles area 
confirmed that many Unocal stations -- including the Van Nuys station -- raised 
prices early. The manager, who declined to give his name, said the stations had 
only two employees on duty after 10 p.m. and would have had difficulty changing 
prices on meters while motorists waited to pay for their gas. 
</P>
<P>
Service station association officials said they hoped that most of their 
members would not try to take advantage of the tax increase. But they 
acknowledged that some might. 
</P>
<P>
In the Northern California town of Redding, near the Oregon line, one gas 
station owner, Bill Swigart, said he had no choice but tack an extra cent a 
gallon onto the 5-cent tax. 
</P>
<P>
"If I just go up five cents, I get hurt," he said, explaining that he would 
only break even if he raised his price by a slightly higher fraction of a cent. 
To round the price off, he added the full extra cent. "My rep said it would 
hurt me, but my customers aren't balking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to the Oregon line, industry officials worried that service station 
owners in towns such as Yreka and Henley might lose business because of the tax 
hike. 
</P>
<P>
"If their customers can go over the state line and get cheaper gas, this could 
end up hurting them bad," Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
One San Francisco Bay Area gasoline distribution company executive said she was 
bracing for a motorist backlash. "I just hope that the consumers understand 
what's going on here," said Bonnie Addario, senior vice president of Olympia 
Oil Co. "They voted for it, but they'll be the first ones to complain about 
it."

IN A FIRST, GROUPS PITCH PRIVATELY FUNDED ROADS, RAIL LINES; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: CALTRANS WILL SELECT FOUR OF EIGHT PROPOSALS, GRANTING RIGHTS OF WAY 
BUT LEAVING CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE WORK TO THE WINNING COMPANIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the first bids of their kind in California, eight private business groups 
Wednesday submitted proposals to Caltrans for road or rail projects to which 
the state would contribute only the rights of way, and all construction and 
maintenance would be paid for privately. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals, of which Caltrans will select four for franchises next month, 
range from an 80-m.p.h. magnetically powered rail line from Los Angeles 
International Airport to Palmdale, to an array of toll highways in Orange, San 
Diego and other counties. 
</P>
<P>
An aura of secrecy surrounded many details of the proposals after officers of 
some of the private firms said they had been warned by Caltrans against saying 
how much their projects would cost or what tolls or fares would eventually be 
charged the public. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans Director Robert K. Best later denied this. He said Caltrans wanted to 
be cautious about releasing details of the projects for proprietary reasons 
affecting the various businesses involved, and to avoid public pressure during 
its selection process. But, he said, each firm was free to say what it wanted 
about its proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, officials of a consortium including the Perini Corp., the firm 
of Daniel, Mann, Johnson &amp; Mendenhall and the HSST Corp. insisted, however, 
that Caltrans had told them not to say how much their magnetic-levitation rail 
system would cost or give other specific details. 
</P>
<P>
The result was that when Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and other area officials 
appeared at a San Fernando Valley news conference to endorse what is the only 
Los Angeles County project being proposed, they had to admit they were 
supporting it without being told what it would cost, how much the fares would 
be or what freeway disruptions might result from the construction process. 
</P>
<P>
These were the projects proposed Wednesday, as described by the various firms, 
under legislation enacted last year to facilitate privatization of road and 
rail projects to supplement publicly funded freeways and other transportation 
systems: 
</P>
<P>
The Perini-led consortium would build the magnetic rail line, using Japanese 
magnetic-levitation technology, to Santa Clarita by 1997 and extend later to 
Palmdale and a possible connection with the proposed Anaheim-to-Las Vegas 
high-speed magnetic line. That line, however, is supposed to use German 
technology, which would necessitate a change of trains in Palmdale. 
Intermediate stops in the initial Santa Clarita phase would be at Jefferson 
Boulevard, Wilshire Boulevard, Victory Boulevard and Chatsworth Street. 
</P>
<P>
The California Toll Road Development Group, composed of Parsons Municipal 
Services Inc., two French companies and an Australian company, would build a 
$1.2-billion, 90-mile toll road from Fremont to Vacaville in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The California Private Transportation Corp., consisting of CRSS Commercial 
Group Inc., Citicorp and several other firms, would construct extra toll lanes 
for private vehicular traffic along the Riverside Freeway from the Riverside 
County line to the Route 55 interchange in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
PrivaCAL, a joint venture of the Bechtel Corp., D. J. Smith Associates Inc. and 
William R. Gray &amp; Co., would build a toll road in San Diego County from 
California 54 in southeast San Diego to California 905 close to the Mexican 
border through a region now being developed. 
</P>
<P>
California Transportation Ventures Inc., including Parsons Brinckerhoff 
Development Group Inc., Fluor Daniel Inc., GIE Transroute of France and 
Prudential-Bache Capital Funding, has a competing proposal for a San Diego toll 
road, but a spokesman for the group would not disclose exactly what route it 
would follow. Caltrans indicated it would largely follow the route PrivaCAL 
wants to use. 
</P>
<P>
The Perot Group Consortium, composed of Greiner Engineering Inc. and seven 
other companies, would extend the 57 Freeway in Orange County in a toll road 
southwest along the Santa Ana River bed. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Systems Associates, including T. Y. Lin International, 
Morrison-Knudsen Engineers, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. Inc. and GTM 
International of France, would build a two-mile $125-million Embarcadero 
expressway in San Francisco, either on the surface or below it, to replace the 
earthquake-damaged Embarcadero Freeway, which is now closed. Company officials 
said that unlike the other proposals, theirs would not be a toll road. 
Construction costs would be redeemed by selling airspace above the expressway. 
</P>
<P>
Enserch Corp., with Ebasco Services Inc. and six other companies affiliated, 
would build a toll road from California 126 at the Los Angeles County line, 
running southwest in Ventura County to Tapo Canyon Road, with a second phase to 
carry the project to the 118 Freeway west of the Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans Director Best said he wants to avoid as much as possible popular 
agitation for or against the proposals while his agency decides which four to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
He said that there would be plenty of time for public discussion later during 
environmental studies and that all projects would be subject to the later final 
approval of Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Best spoke in a telephone interview, Mayor Bradley and Assemblyman 
Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) tried to exert pressure on behalf of the Perini rail 
proposal through the San Fernando Valley, declaring at the news conference that 
Caltrans should definitely accept the only project proposed from the state's 
most-populous county. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley proclaimed himself a big supporter of so-called maglev technology, 
under which a train runs on a cushion of air, powered by electromagnetic 
currents. He said he had seen it run on test tracks and viewed it as unique. 
</P>
<P>
The original legislation, sponsored by Assemblyman William P. Baker 
(R-Danville), requires Caltrans to select among the four approved projects at 
least one Northern California and one Southern California proposal. It then has 
a choice of the others.

Here is a brief chronology in the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over oil 
production and their common border. 
</P>
<P>
July 17: Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses Kuwait and the United Arab 
Emirates of flooding the oil market and driving prices down. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue. 
</P>
<P>
July 18: Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of oil from wells 
along disputed border with Iraq and seeking to wreck Iraq's economy by 
overproducing oil and pushing down prices. 
</P>
<P>
July 20: Kuwaiti officials suggest Iraq's sudden outburst of belligerence is 
aimed at getting its creditors -- including Kuwait -- to write off billions of 
dollars in debts from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. 
</P>
<P>
July 24: The U.S. Defense Department announces that Navy warships and aircraft 
are holding a "short-notice exercise" in the Persian Gulf with the United Arab 
Emirates, about 600 miles southeast of the Kuwait-Iraqi border. Kuwait goes on 
state of alert. 
</P>
<P>
July 25: Baghdad says that it will not be intimidated by U.S. pressure in its 
oil dispute with neighboring Kuwait, and Hussein summons the U.S. ambassador 
for talks. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt says Iraq and Kuwait will meet in 
Saudi Arabia for talks. 
</P>
<P>
July 26: OPEC ministers in Geneva agree to halt overproduction in hopes of 
pushing up the price of crude oil. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates pledge 
to abide by the agreement.

oil and border dispute. Diplomats say Iraq has 100,000 troops on Kuwait's 
border; Kuwait army numbers about 20,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 1: Unconfirmed reports say Iraq has moved more troops toward the Kuwaiti

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today he has asked Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to have the Soviet Union halt arms deliveries 
to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state said he learned of the movement of Iraqi forces into 
Kuwait just before his final meeting with Shevardnadze today. 
</P>
<P>
"We condemn this (Iraqi invasion) and we call on Iraq to withdraw," Baker told 
reporters on his plane on a flight from Irkutsk to the Mongolian capital of 
Ulan Bator " . . . Coercion and intimidation is not the way to resolve 
disputes." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he had told Shevardnadze about the Iraqi invasion and the Soviet 
foreign minister "was not pleased." Baker did not say he had obtained any 
commitment from Shevardnadze to halt the Soviet arms delivery. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Administration official on Baker's plane said that Baker had spoken 
with National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft about the Mideast situation. 
Baker said no decision had been made yet on whether he should return to 
Washington early from his planned three-day stop in Mongolia, during which he 
had arranged a hunting and fishing expedition.

TOKYO STOCKS FALL, YEN BOUNCES AS OIL CUSTOMER REACTS

Tokyo stocks plummeted in early afternoon trading today and the yen fluctuated 
wildly against the dollar as Japan monitored news of an Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is hugely dependent on Persian Gulf oil supplies and a Foreign Ministry 
official said of the attack: "We deeply regret (the development) because it 
involves military actions. 
</P>
<P>
"The conflict, if further aggravated and prolonged, would have significant 
impact on Japan in various forms, especially in terms of oil supplies." 
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the key Nikkei index -- which had fallen 255 
points in the morning session, partly over gulf tensions -- plunged almost 
another 400 points in the first 25 minutes of afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
It stood at 30,199.64, just over 638 points down on the day or 2.07%. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo currency dealers were also anxiously watching gulf developments with news 
of the fighting between the two oil producers boosting the dollar by nearly a 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was incredible. The market was thin, but it just went wild," said Yuko 
Fukakusa, assistant manager at Tokai Bank. "The dollar's safe-haven status is 
still alive and well." 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fluctuated violently between its morning low of 146.50 yen and high 
of 148.15, reached after frenzied buying after a Japanese translation of the 
news appeared. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was at 147.70 yen at midday. 
</P>
<P>
Yen-denominated gold futures rose sharply.

HOUSE PASSES $28-BILLION HOUSING PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: BUSH THREATENS A VETO UNLESS THE FINAL BILL CONFORMS TO CHEAPER 
SENATE VERSION. SHORING UP FHA INSURANCE FUND IS A KEY ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House overwhelmingly approved the first major renovation of federal housing 
policies in more than a decade Wednesday, but Republicans warned that President 
Bush will veto the $28-billion bill unless substantial changes are made. 
</P>
<P>
Although a number of the GOP lawmakers said that their support was conditional 
on changes being made during negotiations with the Senate, the omnibus housing 
authorization bill swept through the House on a vote of 378 to 43. 
</P>
<P>
It now must be reconciled with a Senate-passed $17.8-billion plan that the 
Administration supports. That process could be difficult because the 
differences between the bills are not only technical but philosophical, 
reflecting the two parties' sharply contrasting views as to the direction that 
the nation's housing policies should take. 
</P>
<P>
Like the bill passed by the Senate on June 27, the House measure represents a 
major effort to redesign federal housing policies to make them more effective 
in meeting the needs of the homeless and of low-income renters who are being 
squeezed out by rising prices and a declining supply of affordable public 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the House 
Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, would increase funds for current 
housing programs and spur building of low-income rental units, and it contains 
several initiatives to help first-time buyers realize the increasingly elusive 
American dream of owning a home. 
</P>
<P>
The House version differs from the Senate bill, which was the product of a 
compromise with the Administration, in the greater emphasis it places on money 
for new construction and rehabilitation of low-income rental units. Moreover, 
the two bills take very different approaches to plans for rescuing the Federal 
Housing Administration's troubled mortgage insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
The House bill would be costlier than the Senate's, authorizing 65% more money 
for fiscal 1991 than was appropriated for housing programs in this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the sharply different approach to shoring up the FHA's mortgage 
insurance program that provoked the most controversy about the House bill and 
kept it under the cloud of a White House veto. 
</P>
<P>
With the savings and loan crisis haunting the election-year thoughts of 
legislators on both sides of the aisle, the financially troubled FHA fund 
emerged as the focal point of the housing debate after a study found that the 
fund could become insolvent. Defaults are expected to result in losses of $350 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, alarmed by warnings that another "baby S&amp;L crisis" was in the 
offing, included in its housing bill an Administration proposal to bolster the 
fund through more stringent financing requirements, including one that would 
require buyers to make larger down payments. 
</P>
<P>
House Democrats rejected the Administration's approach. They said it would shut 
out as many as 100,000 potential buyers who would not be able to come up with 
more than $1,400 in additional closing costs and insurance premium payments to 
buy their first FHA-insured homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal supported by the Administration would turn the FHA program on its 
head," Rep. Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.) said. "We are debating not only the future 
of the FHA program but of many young families who would like to purchase a 
home." 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' counterproposal, which, in the end, won broad bipartisan 
support, would hold payments to current levels but prohibit FHA insurance 
coverage of a loan exceeding the market value of the mortgaged property. 
</P>
<P>
That provision was approved, 418 to 2, late Tuesday night, but, when the debate 
was resumed Wednesday, Republicans warned that Bush would still veto the bill 
unless the more stringent FHA proposals in the Senate version are adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill needs a stronger FHA provision," said Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie 
(R-Ohio), the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee. Wylie said that he 
was voting for the bill because it was better than current law, but he warned 
that GOP leaders would work to sustain Bush's veto unless it is modified in 
conference.

PANEL VOTES TO OPEN DOOR TO IMMIGRATION; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: HOUSE MEMBERS SEEK TO INCREASE ANNUAL VISAS TO 775,000 FROM 
540,000. THE ACTION IS INTENDED TO BENEFIT EUROPEANS AND AFRICANS.

Congress took a long stride Wednesday toward enacting major immigration changes 
that would allow entry of at least 90,000 more foreigners each year and open 
the door wider to Western Europeans, who have been all but shut out for a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
The House Judiciary Committee voted, 23 to 12, for legislation that would 
increase the overall number of annual visas issued to legal immigrants to 
775,000 from the 540,000 in current law and the 630,000 proposed in a 
Senate-passed measure. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first revision of legal immigration laws in 25 years and would 
follow the enactment in 1986 of a statute aimed at stemming the influx of 
illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
While continuing a family reunification policy that has predominantly benefited 
Latinos and Asians, the House bill places new emphasis on work skills and 
establishes a new category for "diversity immigrants" to broaden the mix of 
nationalities admitted to the country. 
</P>
<P>
Both changes are intended to significantly increase immigration of Europeans 
and Africans -- and, not incidentally, to expand political support for the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
Other changes include a streamlining of applicant procedures for businesses 
seeking to bring in workers with particularly needed skills. A key amendment 
sponsored by Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) would prevent deportation 
of spouses and minor children of people who were given legal status under the 
amnesty provision of the 1986 law. 
</P>
<P>
A bill passed by the Senate a year ago has a similar thrust but on a smaller 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders expressed confidence that action can be completed this 
year, despite an Administration veto threat over the proposed immigration 
increases and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic sponsors argue that "reasonable increases" of legal immigrants are 
needed to reduce huge applicant backlogs, to balance out the numbers from 
source countries and to provide the skilled workers needed to make the United 
States more competitive in world trade. 
</P>
<P>
"The business community is getting the things it wants. Labor unions are 
satisfied. The family-based and diversity immigration groups are on board," 
said Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.), primary sponsor of the measure. "It is a 
bill that has enough benefits and improvements for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, including both Republicans and Democrats, object that inflating 
immigration levels would unduly burden social services, take away jobs from 
American citizens and generally degrade the "quality of life" enjoyed by 
American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
On the House floor, critics will seek to have the proposed increases focus more 
on employment skills and less on family-based considerations. 
</P>
<P>
In committee debate, Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) said that while "most 
immigrants have made solid citizens," there are "some limits to unbridled 
generosity." Noting that schools and hospitals in his district are already 
strained by immigrants, Moorhead said that "if you force them on us faster than 
we can assimilate them, we will not be able to keep up our quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
Berman rejoined that studies show legal immigrants quickly "produce jobs and 
create money for the public treasury." 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that thousands of people would be affected by the Berman 
amendment aimed at keeping together family members of newly legal immigrants. 
The amendment would liberalize a "family fairness" policy announced by the 
Immigration and Nationalization Service last year. 
</P>
<P>
Under that policy, only spouses and minor children who entered the United 
States before Nov. 11, 1986, are protected from deportation. Berman's proposal 
moves the cutoff date to Jan. 1, 1990, responding to protests from Latino 
groups that many family members who would eventually qualify for legal status 
are being unfairly deported during the waiting period.

RESTITUTION PAYMENTS READIED FOR OLDEST WW II INTERNEES

All Japanese-Americans over 80 years of age who are believed to have been 
interned or relocated during World War II have been contacted by a special 
Justice Department unit concerning $20,000 restitution payments, officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
With as much as $500 million in payments to begin in October, the Office of 
Redress Administration has sent more than 24,000 letters about potential 
eligibility and has readied 19,000 cases for payment, according to Robert 
Bratt, administrator for redress. 
</P>
<P>
The funds for the restitution have been appropriated and appear to be "safe" 
from problems that could arise from the fight over budget-paring, Bratt said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, each Japanese-American who was 
evacuated, relocated or interned during the war is eligible to receive $20,000. 
The law stipulates that payments be made in the order of age, starting with the 
oldest eligible recipients. 
</P>
<P>
All those born before 1910 for whom ORA has found a current address have been 
contacted, a spokesman for the office said. The $500-million appropriation 
could also reach "some 69-year-olds," Bratt said, depending on how many 
additional persons in the 70-to-79 age bracket come forward between now and 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Although ORA believes that it has reached all those who are eligible and over 
80, anyone who is overlooked may write: Office of Redress Administration, Over 
Eighty, P.O. Box 66260, Washington, D.C. 20035-6260. The letter should include 
the applicant's full current name and address, name at time of internment, date 
of birth and telephone number.

ATLANTA ARCHBISHOP QUIT OVER RELATIONSHIP, CHURCH CONFIRMS

The resignation last month of Atlanta's Roman Catholic archbishop was prompted 
by the discovery of his two-year relationship with a woman, his successor 
confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Eugene A. Marino, 56, who was the nation's highest ranking black 
Roman Catholic, resigned July 10 for what he said were health reasons and the 
need for "spiritual renewal, psychological therapy and medical supervision." 
</P>
<P>
He had relinquished his duties in May because of severe stress and a near heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
But Atlanta television station WAGA reported Wednesday that Marino's 
resignation followed the church's discovery of a relationship between the 
archbishop and a lay minister, Vicki R. Long. Marino's temporary successor, 
Bishop James P. Lyke, said the former archbishop gave permission Wednesday to 
confirm the relationship after the television station's report. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the television station nor Lyke said whether the relationship was 
sexual in nature. 
</P>
<P>
Lyke said that church officials were told in March that Marino was involved 
with a woman. He defended the decision of the archdiocese to withhold the 
details of Marino's resignation. He said Marino was the only one who could 
"call the shots." 
</P>
<P>
Father Peter Dora, Atlanta Archdiocese spokesman, said church officials would 
not comment further until a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Long filed a $2.3-million paternity suit against a priest, Donal 
Keohane of Columbus, alleging that he fathered her child. The church is paying 
child support, but denies that Keohane is the father of child. 
</P>
<P>
Long declined to comment about the allegations involving Marino. 
</P>
<P>
The television station reported it had obtained photographs of Marino and Long 
attending various functions together and a flight insurance policy for a trip 
to Mexico taken by Marino. Long was listed as the archbishop's beneficiary on 
the policy.

YOUTH TESTIFIES HE DID NOT ATTACK JOGGER; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: DEFENDANT YUSEF SALAAM TELLS COURT HE WAS IN CENTRAL PARK BUT NEVER SAW

In a dramatic gamble, defendant Yusef Salaam took the witness stand on his own 
behalf Wednesday to deny that he participated in the gang rape and assault that 
almost killed an investment banker while she was jogging last year in New 
York's Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
The brutality of the attack on the 29-year-old jogger, who was left to die in a 
puddle of mud and her own blood, horrified New Yorkers and became a national 
symbol of urban fear and violence. 
</P>
<P>
Salaam, 16, who testified despite the vigorous objections of lawyers for two 
other defendants, said he entered the park the night the crime was committed 
with a group of 50 youths, but soon split from the group. He said he carried a 
12-inch-long metal pipe that was given to him by a friend for safekeeping and 
that he saw several youths beating someone near the jogging track. 
</P>
<P>
Salaam said he also stumbled on a bum he thought was dead, but ran away without 
notifying the police. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had touched that person, my fingerprints would have been on him," the 
tall forcefully spoken teen-ager said in response to a staccato, skeptical 
cross examination by Assistant Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Lederer. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you call for help?" the prosecutor asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Salaam said. 
</P>
<P>
"You stayed in the park?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I did," the witness replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it true that the reason you're testifying today is because you don't 
want to take responsibility for a woman you damn near killed," the prosecutor 
asked, glaring at the defendant who glared back. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't try to kill anybody," Salaam said. 
</P>
<P>
Salaam said that soon after entering the park he left his 50 companions as they 
were climbing a hill because, "I got tired." 
</P>
<P>
He said he never saw, touched or attacked the jogger the night of April 19, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember a female jogger being assaulted," he testified. "That would 
have stood out most in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
The defendant was asked why he entered the park at night. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be fun," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
His statements directly contradicted previous testimony by Detective Thomas 
McKenna that Salaam had confessed to hitting the woman jogger twice with the 
pipe and had fondled her breasts. Unlike two other defendants, Antron McCray, 
16, and Raymond Santana, 15, Salaam did not sign a statement or make a 
videotaped confession. All three defendants are charged with 13 criminal 
counts, including attempted murder, rape and sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives stopped questioning Salaam when they learned he was only 15 years 
old, not a year older as his bus pass indicated. Under New York state law, a 
witness under 15 can not be questioned without a parent or guardian present. 
</P>
<P>
Salaam said he first met the other defendants when they were together in a 
holding pen in a local police precinct after being arrested after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Salaam told the jury Wednesday he carried the bus pass with a false age to 
attract girls. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I'm tall, I would tell the girls I was older than the age I was," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His testimony was a high risk strategy by his lawyer, Robert Burns. When Burns 
decided Tuesday to put his client on the stand, his fellow defense lawyers 
pleaded angrily with him in the hallway outside the seventh floor courtroom not 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
In the courtroom, Burns asked: "Did you see a female jogger?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I never saw a female jogging," Salaam answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you tell Detective McKenna you saw a female jogger in the park?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," the defendant said. 
</P>
<P>
These answers were received skeptically by Lederer who sought to hammer home to 
the jury several points: That detectives initially believed Salaam was 16 
because of the altered bus pass, that he carried the pipe into the park as a 
weapon, and that he realized the gravity of what had happened in the park while 
he was being questioned.

VIEWS ON GOVERNOR'S FISCAL LEGACY VARY WIDELY; 
</P>
<P>
STATE BUDGET: DEUKMEJIAN ANTICIPATED CRITICISM OF HIS SPENDING PLAN VETOES. THE 
LEGISLATURE IS UNLIKELY TO OVERTURN THEM. A LATER EFFORT TO RESTORE PROGRAMS IS

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's performance as the iron-fisted manager of state 
finances came in for fresh reviews Wednesday as aftershocks from the heavily 
retrenched new state budget rippled through California. 
</P>
<P>
"George Deukmejian has put California's future on hold," said Democratic Senate 
leader David A. Roberti, who has both devised compromises and jousted sharply 
with the Republican governor over the past 7 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
But maverick GOP Sen. Ed Davis of Santa Clarita observed that unsettled 
political and economic realities are so pervasive that in recent years "no 
governor has left with a great legacy of being actually on top of the fiscal 
curve." 
</P>
<P>
Legislators and observers weighed in with assessments of Deukmejian's legacy as 
a fiscal manager a day after he signed a long overdue compromise $55.7-billion 
state budget. At the same time, he substantially vetoed funds for education, 
mental health and local services. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining his vetoes, Deukmejian anticipated the criticism they would 
bring, asserting in a prepared text: "The big spenders won't be satisfied. They 
never are. But I'm proud that we have protected the interests of the average 
taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
And looking ahead to what historians might say of him, the governor added: 
"While I inherited a budget deficit in 1983, I am leaving my successor a 
balanced budget, a prudent reserve and long-term structural budget reforms." 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature and the governor had agreed to many of the cuts. But after he 
got the budget, Deukmejian went even further with his blue-pencil vetoes. Since 
his brief televised remarks on Tuesday, Deukmejian has not made himself 
available for elaboration on the vetoes. 
</P>
<P>
But gubernatorial chief of staff Michael Frost defended the spending plan, 
noting that the portion of the budget over which the Legislature and governor 
have direct control grew by 7.6% over last year's program. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at states like New York, which only had a 2% increase in the 
budget, I think it is a little unfair to say that this is so much of a 
devastating budget," Frost told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted that from the outset Deukmejian had intended to make as "fair and 
even" cuts as possible to keep the state within its income, but was prevented 
from doing so by the insistence of Democratic budget leaders that $800 million 
in voter-approved Proposition 98 education money was not on the negotiating 
table. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't allowed to make these cuts fair and equitable across all the 
programs because one major program, (Proposition 98) representing 42% of the 
budget, is off limits," Frost said. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the Legislature is likely to uphold Deukmejian's vetoes, as 
painful as they may be. Roberti and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) both predicted that any attempts by the Legislature this year to 
override the vetoes will fail. 
</P>
<P>
"But in January, efforts will be made to restore the various programs, 
regardless of (whether Democrat Dianne Feinstein or Republican Pete Wilson) 
wins the governorship," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The reassessments of Deukmejian's fiscal performance came from longtime friends 
and foes alike and some political observers outside of Sacramento. Few gave him 
a ringing endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of his legacy, he has not, unfortunately, been a leader," said 
retired Legislative Analyst A. Alan Post, who worked with Deukmejian as a 
legislator in the 1960s and 1970s. "As governor, he stressed partisan political 
prejudices . . . instead of comprehensive, thoughtful, courageous attacks on 
the highest priority needs of the state." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said during the Deukmejian Administration the skies have turned 
smoggier, schools more crowded, freeways more congested and the homeless more 
numerous on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"California has gone through quantum change in eight years," he said. "George 
Deukmejian hasn't changed. During the whole Deukmejian Administration, we never 
sat back after three or four years and made a plan for the future to move 
forward. That's my quarrel." 
</P>
<P>
Republican Davis said he, too, yearns for some long-range budget planning 
procedure that would enable state policy makers to help make decisions beyond 
the current one-year budget. But he said the inherent optimism of Californians 
about the good health of the state's economy may be a stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
"We are so rah-rah about California that it is difficult for us to accept the 
fact that there could be anything but a burgeoning economy for us. No place has 
that forever," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks, a conservative Republican who 
sharply disagreed with Deukmejian when the governor embraced a gasoline tax 
increase last summer as a means of financing the Proposition 111 transportation 
plan, credited Deukmejian's prison construction program as a "solid 
accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
But he charged that overall the Deukmejian fiscal legacy would be remembered as 
a "new era of major tax increases" and as "eight years of muddling through 
without any clear idea of where he wanted the state to go." 
</P>
<P>
From academia came the view of Bruce Cain, assistant director of the Institute 
of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley, who said he believed Deukmejian did his 
best to implement his conservative principles of less government and taxation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Deukmejian would say that given how he was stuck with a Democratic 
Legislature and given how he had to deal with Brown and Roberti for eight 
years, it was about all he could do. He's probably right," Cain said.

ART AND POLITICS MIX TO CELEBRATE LEGISLATURE'S RESCUE OF POOL MURAL

Artists and politicos mixed Tuesday at a pool side bash to celebrate the 
Legislature's decision to rescue a hip hotel's underwater mural from swimming 
safety laws requiring pool bottoms to be solid white. 
</P>
<P>
New York artist Francis Forlenza, who painted an "aquamural" full of colors and 
curlicues for Chip Conley, owner of San Francisco's Phoenix Inn, said the 
salvation of his work represents a victory for art and a defeat for 
fuddy-duddies the world over. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think art can only be on a four-by-four canvas in an art 
gallery," the 32-year-old painter said. "Little kids don't want to go to an art 
gallery, but they see art this way. It's fun." 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix Inn's 45-foot egg-shaped swimming hole, which sports pale-blue 
"stylized waves" that look like sixes and nines on a navy blue base, became the 
second pool in the state to be exempted from the law. California lawmakers in 
1988 spared a pool painting done by British artist David Hockney at the 
Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who whisked the exemption bill 
through the Legislature, and San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos were among about 200 
supporters of the Phoenix Inn underwater mural who attended the evening pool 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Innkeeper Conley said he staged the soiree to celebrate what he once thought 
was a lost cause. He didn't know about the state law mandating white pool 
bottoms when he commissioned Forlenza in January to paint the pool at his 
44-room motel. The underwater Pop Art was to be the finishing touch in Conley's 
transformation of a once-seedy motel into a trendy inn now frequented by such 
pop stars as Tracy Chapman, Sinead O'Connor and Linda Ronstadt. 
</P>
<P>
"I was almost sure that we were going to have to paint it over," said Conley, 
who avoided trouble with the law by briefly closing the pool to swimmers this 
spring until San Francisco Supervisor Terence Hallinan, Agnos and Brown pledged 
to fight to save Forlenza's painting, titled "My Fifteen Minutes/Tumbling 
Waves."

INTERFERON FOUND EFFECTIVE AGAINST HEPATITIS B

Interferon is the first treatment to relieve and cause remission of lingering 
hepatitis B infections, the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and one 
of the world's biggest killers, researchers have found. 
</P>
<P>
A study found that injections of the natural protein can stop the hepatitis B 
virus from destroying the liver in almost half of the people who are 
chronically infected. One in 10 undergoes remission. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, there has been no treatment for the hepatitis B virus. While 
interferon clearly does not help everyone, having any therapy at all is 
considered to be an important step in controlling the infection. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an encouraging result. All of us would feel a lot happier if we had a 
better treatment. This spurs us on to find that," commented Dr. Baruch S. 
Blumberg of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. He won the Nobel Prize 
in medicine in 1976 for identifying the hepatitis B virus. 
</P>
<P>
The latest research, conducted on 169 people at 12 hospitals, is the first 
large-scale comparison study of interferon for hepatitis B. It confirms several 
smaller studies suggesting that the treatment works. 
</P>
<P>
Other studies have also shown that interferon works against hepatitis C, 
another serious but less common variety of the virus. On Tuesday, an advisory 
committee of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended that interferon 
be marketed for hepatitis C. 
</P>
<P>
"We can be relatively sure what doctors will find in practice, said Dr. Robert 
P. Perrillo of the St. Louis Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the principal 
author of the study. Perrillo said that 10% of hepatitis B patients will 
undergo remission "and 40% or 50% will be made better and their liver disease 
will be stopped in its tracks." 
</P>
<P>
The results were published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. An 
estimated 1 million to 1.5 million people in the United States are long-term 
carriers of the virus, and at least half of them have liver disease. Worldwide, 
300 million people, or 5% of the population, are chronically infected.

ANOTHER BLOW TO DODGERS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: ROOKIE NEIDLINGER PITCHES WELL, BUT CARTER HOMERS OFF HOWELL IN THE 
NINTH AS GIANTS WIN, 2-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
That unlikeliest of occurrences, a pitchers' duel involving the Dodgers' fifth 
spot in the rotation, came to pass Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Neidlinger, making his major league debut and trying to fill the spot that 
has troubled the staff since Orel Hershiser was injured, threw six innings of 
one-run ball and assured himself of another start. 
</P>
<P>
However, two veterans dampened the rookie's opening night when Gary Carter hit 
a leadoff home run in the ninth inning off Jay Howell to break a 1-1 tie and 
Don Robinson threw a complete-game four-hitter to beat the Dodgers, 2-1, before 
a Dodger Stadium crowd of 36,453. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who moved back into the National League West race on this home 
stand, suddenly take a two-game losing streak onto the road, where they have 
had problems. The loss dropped them 3 1/2 games behind the second-place Giants 
and nine behind the division-leading Reds, while the Giants remained 5 1/2 out. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, improving to 8-1, was hurt only by Mike Scioscia's fifth-inning home 
run. The Dodgers' only other uprising came in the ninth, when Kal Daniels 
disputed a third strike hotly enough to be ejected. Robinson retired the last 
nine batters. 
</P>
<P>
Neidlinger's effort was followed by two perfect innings of relief by Tim Crews. 
But the resurgent Carter -- playing first base with Will Clark nursing a 
strained groin -- hit Howell's third pitch of the ninth into the left-field 
pavilion, his second homer in two games. Howell's next nine pitches were 
strikes, but the damage was done. He fell to 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the players in the ninth all I need is one run," Robinson said. "I had 
everything working tonight -- the curveball, the fastball. Knowing the Reds had 
already won, we needed a win." 
</P>
<P>
Neidlinger worked six solid innings before being lifted for a pinch-hitter in a 
1-1 tie. The slender right-hander, who has always given up more hits than 
innings pitched in the minors, allowed seven hits but was in real trouble only 
in the third, when the Giants scored the game's first run. 
</P>
<P>
Neidlinger, who struck out three -- all called -- walked only one batter, but 
paid for it. Brett Butler drew a one-out walk in the third and scored on 
consecutive singles by Mike Kingery and Rick Leach. But Neidlinger got the 
Giants' most dangerous RBI man, Matt Williams, on a grounder and struck out 
Carter to get out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants threatened again in the sixth when two of the first three hitters 
singled, but Neidlinger coaxed Robby Thompson to hit into a double play to end 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I had butterflies, but after the first couple of pitches I treated it like 
another game," the 25-year-old Neidlinger said. "I tried to get ahead of the 
hitters and not walk anybody. I really didn't try to envision anything. I think 
it will probably all hit me later, the first game and all that." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said Neidlinger "will start five days from now when 
we need a fifth starter. He did a real good job. You give that club one run in 
six innings, you've done a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia said he remains encouraged by the Dodgers' recent play despite the 
past two games. "The pitching has come around," he said. "Jay Howell is still 
one of the premier relievers in baseball. It's not good to lose ground, it's a 
half-step backward, but not something we can't turn around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Giant Manager Roger Craig branded his team "amazing" for continuing to win 
despite injuries to Clark and Kevin Mitchell, and said the Dodgers are still a 
factor, especially if they do well in the four-game series in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gonna be a tough run," Craig said. "We have a chance to catch (the Reds). 
The Dodgers are still in it, too. They always play us tough." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Don Robinson played tougher. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
X-rays of Juan Samuel's sprained left ankle were negative, injured in Tuesday's 
game against the Reds, but Samuel didn't suit up or take batting practice 
Wednesday. He's listed as day-to-day. . . . Mike Morgan, also nursing an ankle 
sprain, is expected to make his scheduled start Saturday. . . . Giant slugger 
Kevin Mitchell missed his fourth consecutive start Wednesday. He received an 
anti-inflammatory shot in his sore wrist last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Giant pitcher Don Robinson narrowly avoided a bizarre injury in the fourth 
inning when he was so intent on fielding Kirk Gibson's grounder that he almost 
didn't notice Gibson's broken bat hurtling toward his head. He ducked away just 
in time. . . . Mike Scioscia's fifth-inning home run was his 10th, tying his 
career high. . . . Eddie Murray hit .357 with seven home runs and 18 RBIs in 
July. Murray extended his hitting streak to 12 games Wednesday. . . . Mike 
Sharperson hit .348 in July. . . . The oft-maligned Dodger bullpen has a 1.37 
earned-run average over the last 52 2/3 innings and has allowed only 10 runs 
over that period. 
</P>
<P>
They were still talking about Kal Daniels' near home run Tuesday night, a line 
drive caught by the Reds' Eric Davis in deepest center in the seventh inning. 
It would have given the Dodgers a lead in what turned out to be a 5-2 loss. 
Batting instructor Ben Hines, who mans the first-base coaching box, said it 
would be tough to hit a ball harder. "I thought it was gone. In the first base 
box I said, 'Yeah!' . . . (then) nothing," Hines said. "He must've hit it so 
flush it didn't have any backspin and stayed down. That ball was smoked." 
Daniels was so sure the ball was going out he jumped in frustration when his 
former teammate caught it. Said Davis: "If it stayed in the ballpark I knew I 
had it. I was a step from the wall. He hit it good, but not good enough."

THINKING MAN'S PLAYER IS MISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Ekern looked more like a straight line than a linebacker. How he survived 
13 seasons in the National Football League with his body remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern was a walking sandwich board against steroid use. He wasn't fast, strong 
or quick. You worried when Ekern stuck his face into the line of scrimmage to 
make a tackle. Most times he made it, though. In 1988, his last season with the 
Rams, Ekern, then 34, led the team in tackles with 93. Four times in his career 
he made more than 100 in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern succeeded with brain, not brawn. The team listed him at 6-feet-3 and 228 
pounds in the program. That was in full uniform, soaking wet. 
</P>
<P>
In a game against San Francisco two years ago, Ekern lost 15 pounds of 
perspiration on a humid day in Anaheim. In the locker room afterward, the 
doctors hooked him up to an intravenous machine. 
</P>
<P>
When Ekern was named to his only Pro Bowl in 1986, most considered it a 
lifetime achievement award for survival. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern was the team's captain and coach on the field. In his time, he would log 
as much film time in a dark room as Woody Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern was a coach's dream: smart, selfless, giving. He never understood why 
anyone wanted to interview him. 
</P>
<P>
In his mind, he was a dock worker. Each day, he put on his hard hat and went to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
He never was caught up in the trappings of his sport. He drove a beaten-up, 
orange Volkswagen bug to Rams Park, always crammed with various debris and 
wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
Never secure with his future, Ekern played the last year of his career for a 
guaranteed $200,000, rather than risk losing a larger, non-guaranteed salary if 
he was released. 
</P>
<P>
No one was more devastated by Ekern's death Wednesday morning than Ram 
defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur, who held Ekern up to a different light. 
</P>
<P>
"He was probably one of my favorite people in the world," Shurmur said. 'I 
don't know of a guy who gave any more of himself to the game and to the job 
when he was playing. He took very little and gave a hell of a lot. There hasn't 
been a guy in the history of the game that prepared to play the game any better 
than he did." 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur always said Ekern was the smartest player he ever coached. Had Shurmur 
received the head coaching job at Phoenix this year -- he was a finalist -- 
Ekern would have joined his coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
When the Rams drafted linebacker Larry Kelm in the fourth round in 1987, 
Shurmur saw an heir apparent to Ekern. 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur ordered Kelm to follow Ekern around camp to, in a football sense, 
absorb him. Kelm did and has since taken over Ekern's position as defensive 
signal-caller. 
</P>
<P>
"He always had time to spend with me," Kelm said. "We spent a lot of time 
watching film together after practice; 6, 7, at night. He basically groomed me. 
I always enjoyed watching him work, because he had such a tremendous work 
ethic. He worked as hard as anyone around." 
</P>
<P>
Coaches are calling Kelm the new Carl Ekern. "For me to be compared to him is 
great," Kelm said. "He really applied himself, he was always working to be the 
best he could. Sometimes a big heart will overcome what you don't have in other 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
Ekern, a volunteer coach with the Rams last season, recently accepted a 
position coaching juvenile delinquents in football at a youth camp in Nevada. 
Wednesday was to be his first day on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Ekern dropped by the Rams' training facilities at UC Irvine 
to see old friends and pick up some training tips from the team's strength 
coordinator, Garrett Giemont. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern sat in on a Rams' team meeting Tuesday night before beginning a long 
desert drive from which he would not return. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to him last night," veteran center Doug Smith said. "He just started 
doing some work with juvenile delinquents to get them out of the problem 
lifestyle. I wished him well with it, and those were the last words I said to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Ekern was not a saint. He was working on his second marriage. He also 
enjoyed his share of beer, which makes one pause until the Kern County 
Coroner's toxicology reports have been completed, although there is no 
indication that the accident is alcohol-related. 
</P>
<P>
But on a football field, Ekern squeezed more from less than seemed imaginable. 
To him, football was as much a science as a contact sport. There's no telling 
how much of that knowledge he might have passed on to others. 
</P>
<P>
In one quick moment, he is gone. Those who knew him had difficulty coming to 
grips with that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like you don't want to believe it," said linebacker Mel Owens, who 
played eight seasons with Ekern. "He was out here yesterday, you saw him, 
talked to him. It can't be. I just saw him yesterday. He was a great man, a 
great leader, a person who would always help you. It's almost unbelievable, 
like it's not really true."

HORSE RACING: THANKS TO SATELLITE WAGERING, DEL MAR BECOMES NO. 1 MEETING IN 
THE COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was a strange feeling, said Joe Harper, as he recalled his first brush with 
the phenomenon of the invisible horseplayer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be sitting in my office, watching the pool totals come across the 
television screen," said the president and general manager of the Del Mar 
Thoroughbred Club. "They were huge. Then I'd go outside to walk around. And I 
saw about six people!" 
</P>
<P>
That was the summer of 1988, when Del Mar began broadcasting its races to a 
variety of sites that included the major metropolitan tracks of Los Angeles 100 
miles to the north. The move effectively stunted the steadily growing 
attendance and pari-mutuel numbers at Del Mar; but the new revenue rolling in 
from its several betting "satellites" -- including Santa Anita and Hollywood 
Park -- seemed to more than offset any losses. 
</P>
<P>
"We were making money," said Harper. "But I was awfully lonely counting it." 
</P>
<P>
He's still counting. Today, Del Mar has become the nation's most successful 
race track in terms of pari-mutuel handle. On any given afternoon, more people 
are watching the races at an off-track locale, rather than fighting the summer 
traffic to see the live show at Del Mar. And, without exception, the off-track 
crowd will out-bet the live crew by a bundle. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar is reaping the rewards of State Senate Bill 14, signed into law by Gov. 
Deukmejian in September of 1987. Overnight, the pari-mutuel industry of 
Southern California was transformed from a one-track grind into a far-flung 
network of off-track opportunities. As Santa Anita president and chief 
operating officer Cliff Goodrich said at the time, "It was getting harder and 
harder to bring people to our product, so we had to take our product to the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
The product -- legal gambling on horse racing -- is available to practically 
everyone south of Pismo Beach, north of San Diego and west of the Coachella 
Valley. Live in the high desert? There's an off-track site in Victorville. The 
Inland Empire is covered by San Bernardino. Up the coast there are way stations 
in Ventura, Santa Barbara and Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
There are 12 betting satellites, with No. 13 ready to launch at Los Alamitos 
when the Orange County racing fair ends its meet later this month. All of the 
money pours directly into a common pool, with the takeouts, the payoffs and the 
profits consistent throughout the system. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, $187.5 million was bet on the Del Mar races throughout the off-track 
system. This year's business is on a pace that should easily pass $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
Events of last weekend proved once again that Del Mar has the most profitable 
sports television show in Southern California. Spurred on by a pick-six 
carryover of $1.1 million, fans shattered off-track records everywhere while 
chasing after Sunday's jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
In Victorville, 596 hardy souls bet $103,489 on the televised events, 130% more 
than their 1989 average. At Fairplex Park on the L.A. County Fairgrounds, 2,640 
patrons bet an average of $271 each. The combined Santa Anita and Hollywood 
Park attendance Sunday was 21,287, with nary a thoroughbred in site. Compare 
that to the 18,260 who showed up at Belmont Park to see New York's Easy Goer 
win the 1989 Jockey Club Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Southland last Sunday, a record $6,958,869 was churned through 
hundreds of American Totalisator machines, while another $4,519,124 was bet by 
the 24,218 fans packed into Del Mar. Although the $11.4-million total did not 
challenge Santa Anita's regional record of $15.4 million bet on the 1988 
Breeders' Cup program, it did eclipse the former Del Mar mark by more than a 
million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
With Santa Anita and Hollywood Park converted to off-track status in the 
summer, Del Mar is by far the largest beneficiary of the off-track betting 
boom. Del Mar ends up with the best of all worlds: a direct tap into the 
broadest possible market and a reduction of attendance pressure on its 
53-year-old grandstand and over-stressed facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita and Hollywood Park officials are more than happy about their 
off-season cash flow. But from the beginning there has been an underlying tone 
of polite resentment. Del Mar, once considered the backwater country cousin of 
L.A.'s major tracks, suddenly was the No. 1 meeting in the country, at least in 
terms of betting enthusiasm. Santa Anita was No. 2 and the Hollywood summer 
meet was No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita, which moved temporarily back to the No. 1 spot after its meeting 
this year, issued a recent news release that generously predicted record 
betting totals for Del Mar . . . with Santa Anita's help. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to call it a little friendly rivalry," Santa Anita's Goodrich said. 
"It's obvious they have the advantage of the entire L.A. market." 
</P>
<P>
When SB14 was being hammered out, the L.A. majors tried to scale back Del Mar's 
percentage of the off-track profits. Harper and the Del Mar board of directors 
held firm. As a result, each host track -- where the races are actually run -- 
gets 2.65% of off-track straight bets (win, place and show) and 4.25% of 
off-track exotic bets (doubles, triples, exactas and pick six). 
</P>
<P>
"We had studies that indicated there would be immediate decreases of 33% in 
handle and 26% in attendance when off-track betting began," Harper said. "We 
needed to protect against that. At the same time, we had to hope that people 
would continue coming to Del Mar." 
</P>
<P>
The downside would have gutted most race tracks and sent management packing. By 
the end of 1989, Del Mar's on-track handle was down 26% and attendance was off 
17% from the high-water mark of 1987. Concessions, parking and admission fees 
suffered badly. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it cut our L.A. market in half," Harper said. "Either half of them 
decided never to come here again, or all of them decided to come half as often. 
Probably somewhere in between." 
</P>
<P>
Save the tears, though. Because of simulcasting, Del Mar has been able to set 
aside about $6 million a year that will go toward construction of an 
$80-million grandstand after the 1991 meeting. And it doesn't hurt to have 
become No. 1 in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that Del Mar has benefited more from satellite wagering than 
any of the other host tracks," said Don Robbins, Hollywood Park executive vice 
president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, basking in a $7.5-million per day average this season, merely shrugs 
and smiles when prodded by his executive counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago, when there was only a little piece of meat out there for all 
of us, everybody wanted as big a bite as they could get," the Del Mar executive 
said. "Now that the piece of meat is bigger, seems like the appetites tend to 
increase as well." 
</P>
<P>
There's a new place at the table. Lloyd Arnold, the principal owner of Los 
Alamitos Racecourse, will be taking off-track bets on the Del Mar races 
beginning Aug. 19, the day after the Orange County Fair meeting ends its 
nighttime run. 
</P>
<P>
The move has not delighted Santa Anita officials, who consider Orange County to 
be part of their market area and plan an advertising blitz to retain their 
customers. But Arnold is not fazed, and the letter of the law is on his side. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to test this market," Arnold said. "I believe we've been spending 
our time serving a lot of people out in the boondocks. At the same time, we've 
been dancing around a tremendous amount of people right here in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Harper is hopeful that Los Alamitos will open an untapped market for off-track 
betting. He is not pleased, however, with Arnold's plans to offer early betting 
on his night harness meeting, beginning Aug. 24, during the Del Mar afternoon 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are our people in there betting our races," Harper said. "What he's 
talking about is a 'rent-a-crowd' kind of deal, and that's something we've 
always been opposed to. The law is probably not clear on that." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold further predicted that Los Alamitos would someday be taking bets on the 
Hollywood and Santa Anita programs, even though the off-track law would need to 
be amended to change the 45-mile buffer zone. Asked if Santa Anita would 
support an off-track site barely 30 miles from its doorstep, Goodrich replied 
with an unequivocal, "No." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold's response was one of weary patience. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame them for being reluctant," he said. "But sooner or later it's 
going to hurt these tracks if they don't take advantage of the entire Orange 
County market. They (Santa Anita management) say that Los Alamitos would drain 
a million dollars a day from their on-track handle. That's $40,000 to them, and 
I guarantee they won't get hurt any part of that amount when they see the 
potential here." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins agreed that an Orange County simulcast outlet seems to be an 
inevitability. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be willing to discuss options of expanding the system (in Orange 
County)," Robbins said. "However, we're pledged to neutrality on the issue by 
the terms of our sale of Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is very sensitive to their own situation. But as simulcasting becomes 
a more and more important part of the overall revenue picture, we owe it to our 
shareholders to look at anything that will help the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"It is still the on-track numbers that need the most attention. That's what the 
long-term health of the game depends on." 
</P>
<P>
To the people who run the off-track outlet in San Bernardino, healthy means a 
$100,000 night of quarter-horse betting, or a Kentucky Derby simulcast when 
more than 4,000 fans jam into three special rooms of the National Orange Show 
grounds. Although the atmosphere does not compare to the live action at Santa 
Anita or Del Mar, San Bernardino has emerged as the most popular of the 
year-round satellites. 
</P>
<P>
During the 67-day Hollywood Park meeting that ended on July 23, the San 
Bernardino averages were 2,116 in attendance and $397,882 in handle. That was 
double the numbers from Ventura, the next best full-time satellite site. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Randall, the state-licensed manager of the San Bernardino facility, 
describes his patrons as "serious gamblers" who fit the profile of the typical 
race-track customer: a middle-aged male who wants fast service, a good 
television picture and a clean, fairly comfortable place to do his 
handicapping. They could care less about the beauty of a thoroughbred in 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd prefer to be known as a place of entertainment for the 18-and-up crowd," 
said Randall, who has lived in the Inland Empire for 25 years. "We certainly 
have room to expand our market. But in spite of all the advertising we do, 
there are still people out there who don't even know we're here." 
</P>
<P>
Inside an off-track site, the amenities vary. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara took two years to build a decent facility at the Earl Warren 
Fairgrounds. Then, not long after its successful opening, it was pressed into 
service as a temporary shelter in the wake of the devastating fires in June. 
</P>
<P>
The spartan entrance of the Bakersfield betting room at the Kern County 
fairgrounds once was adorned with the warning, "No knives." The Cabazon tribe, 
already sophisticated in marketing bingo, provides a relatively cushy 
atmosphere for its handful of patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Off-track gamblers can make the same bets that the fans at the host track make. 
The only difference is the lack of live sport. 
</P>
<P>
And though there are vast differences in the aesthetics of Del Mar, Santa Anita 
and Hollywood Park, a similar image is developing. With so many people sitting 
at off-track sites, absorbing the sport through closed-circuit television, the 
view of the game has been rendered small and two-dimensional. Except for the 
occasional glimpse of background or unique paddock angle, everything looks the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
"To a certain extent that's true," Don Robbins said. "You'll find that the more 
sophisticated handicappers will recognize the tracks have different courses and 
play them accordingly. But for the most part, these are the same horses running 
everywhere, and the same jockeys riding them." 
</P>
<P>
Off-track betting also has forced the various racing associations and 
owner-trainer groups into a necessary spirit of cooperation, a state of strange 
grace never before witnessed in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
All parties convene regularly to handle off-track betting business under the 
banner of SCOTWINC (Southern California Off-Track Wagering, Inc.), co-chaired 
by Marje Everett of Hollywood Park and Ray Rogers of the Oak Tree Racing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"If nothing else, this has forced us to communicate," Robbins said. "We see 
each other's problems up close, and therefore appreciate them more. And we're 
no longer in a perpetual state of confrontation with the horsemen. We all have 
a vested interest in making simulcasting successful." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there has been some friction over the presentation of the 
product. The host track is in control when it comes to the type of races it 
cards, the menu of bets offered, the contents and delivery of the daily 
programs, a generic advertising campaign, and the quality of simulcast 
television program, which includes announcers giving information and 
handicapping analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be a little frustrating," Robbins noted. "This year, for example, we 
thought we had the program problem with Del Mar ironed out. Instead, we had the 
same glitch we've had for the last two years, and they were late on opening 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar's Harper sympathizes with the satellite operator who is faced with a 
different racing program every time the host track rotates. Each track has a 
different first post time and a different set of exotic bets, not to mention 
inconsistent quality of television broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
"There's also a lot of frustration over the kind of promotion the satellites 
can do," Harper added. "We've increased the amount they can have for 
advertising in their individual market areas, and that's a good step." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Harper and his fellow Del Mar officials are resisting the 
temptation to beat the drum too hard over their ascent to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of downside to that step," Harper said. "I've always been more 
comfortable being a track that was struggling. It's always easier to win coming 
from behind. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what the numbers say, but I don't feel like we've got to hang on by our 
fingernails to the top, because we're nowhere near where we want to be," Harper 
noted. "We've got an old, aging grandstand that needs replacing. We've got a 
very energetic five-year strategic plan. It's like we're coming from behind 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at it this way," Harper concluded. "Del Mar ended a 20-year lease as 
No. 1 in the country. We've got a new 20-year lease and a lot of things we want 
to accomplish. And I'm looking at it like we're starting over."

<P>
If Joe Torre gives them the same insight he did viewers of Angel telecasts, the 
St. Louis Cardinals will improve. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Not a single deal was made Tuesday before the major league trading deadline, a 
sign of these times of free agency and complicated contracts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers and Giants should be aware that 18 of the Reds' next 20 games will 
be played in Cincinnati. . . . 
</P>
<P>
ESPN alienated viewers the way it handled coverage of Nolan Ryan's 300th 
victory. The game wasn't supposed to be shown because of some crazy rule. But 
my cable service carried the first inning and a half from Milwaukee, and then 
switched to the Baltimore-Toronto game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven, who has 279 victories, is the next pitcher with a shot at 300. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
People dressed in suits at ballgames try to look like fans by wearing caps, but 
it doesn't work. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The good news about former Dodger top draft choice Bill Bene's last start at 
Vero Beach is that he gave up only one run and three hits in eight innings. The 
bad news is that he walked nine. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now that Eric Dickerson has signed with agent Leigh Steinberg, does that mean 
he will become a quarterback? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Student-athletes or athlete-students? Colorado and Tennessee opened football 
practice Tuesday, six weeks before the start of classes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the PGA is serious about improving human relations, it will refuse to stage 
any tournament at a private club that has discriminatory policies. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One of Ron Cey's 24 career stolen bases was shown on Diamond Vision the other 
night as the Penguin was saluted during the Dodgers' 100th anniversary 
celebration. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Think Detroit Tiger president Bo Schembechler would like to sign a former wide 
receiver named Kirk Gibson next season, even if he did play at Michigan State? 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is at another record attendance pace, due in no small part to 
reasonable ticket prices. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You know the Cubs are in trouble when the third hitter in their lineup, Mark 
Grace, has only 36 runs batted in. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now we get a lot of Dodger and Angel road games on TV, but all home games of 
the Hollywood Stars and Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League used to 
be televised by Channel 9. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Last manager to move from the broadcasting booth to the dugout was Jerry 
Coleman, whose San Diego Padres finished last in the National League West in 
1980. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Saints reportedly want Steve Wisniewski and a No. 1 draft choice from the 
Raiders for Bobby Hebert. That sounds too steep, especially for a team that 
gave up another offensive lineman, Jim Lachey, for another quarterback, Jay 
Schroeder, two years ago. . . . Word from the Green Bay Packer camp is that 
Tony Mandarich's pass blocking techniques are rapidly improving. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Stefan Edberg has become a gate attraction. The Wimbledon champion drew a 
capacity crowd of 7,866 for a first-round match in the Volvo/Los Angeles 
tournament at UCLA on a Tuesday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The future of Mary Slaney, 31, again is in doubt now that she has undergone 
Achilles' tendon surgery. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Several jockeys are working a double shift these days, afternoons at Del Mar 
and evenings at Los Alamitos. . . . 
</P>
<P>
El Paso-based adviser Ron Weathers has done a terrific job orchestrating George 
Foreman's comeback -- the right opponents, the right paydays and the right 
publicity. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Buster Douglas and Dexter Manley. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Julio Cesar Chavez and Don King, of all people, were seen in Steve Wynn's 
office at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas Tuesday. Possibilities for late 
November are a Chavez-Meldrick Taylor rematch or a Chavez-Hector Camacho bout. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento, home of International Boxing Federation junior-lightweight champion 
Tony Lopez, will try to claim another world title when Loreto Garza challenges 
World Boxing Assn. junior-welterweight champion Juan Coggi, Aug. 17 in Nice, 
France. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Hambletonian, which will be raced at the Meadowlands Saturday, had more 
appeal when it was held country-style at Goshen, N.Y., and Du Quoin, Ill. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Golden State got more from Philadelphia -- a first-round draft choice -- than 
Manute Bol was worth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McHale will be seen in an episode of "Cheers," next season as a ringer 
for the saloon's basketball team in a game against rival Gary's Old Town 
Tavern. . . .

A presidential election -- expected to generate a hotly contested three-way 
race -- will be the highlight of the U.S. Soccer Federation's annual general 
meeting, beginning today in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting will end Sunday with the election of officers. The 
presidential election is especially significant, since whoever is elected will 
preside over the 1994 World Cup, to be held in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
There are three announced candidates for president: current USSF President 
Werner Fricker, USSF Treasurer Paul Stiehl, and former Clipper president Alan 
Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
The elections are expected to set the agenda for soccer in this country for the 
next four years. JULIE CART

Steffi Graf led a seeded charge into the third round of the $500,000 Players 
Challenge tennis championships Wednesday, with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Monique 
Javer in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Showing no ill effects from recent surgery to correct a chronic sinus problem, 
the 21-year-old, top-ranked West German defeated Javer in 49 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, third-seeded Katerina Maleeva of 
Bulgaria and sixth-seeded Jennifer Capriati advanced on a day that saw the 
top-10 seeded players reach the third round. 
</P>
<P>
The 13th-ranked Capriati, who along with the top eight seeded players received 
first-round byes, dazzled fans in her Canadian debut with a 6-4, 6-0 victory 
over U.S. qualifier Lisa Green. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini cruised past American baseliner Kathy Rinaldi, 6-0, 6-3 in 69 minutes 
and Maleeva faced only two break points in her 6-0, 6-2 victory over New 
Zealand's Belinda Cordwell. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva advanced when her opponent, the youngest of the 
three Maleeva sisters, Magdalena, retired in the first set with a rib injury. 
It was the first time the two sisters had faced each other in a professional 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Libor Nemecek reached the quarterfinals of the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships, 
by rallying to a 5-7, 6-1, 6-4 victory over Sandon Stolle in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Czech, who upset eighth-seeded Kevin Curren in the opening 
round, lost the first set after leading 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
But he came back in the second set to even the match, then battled to 4-4 in 
the final set, before his deep returns and aggressive forehands ended it for 
Stolle. 
</P>
<P>
Nemecek was joined in the quarterfinals by fifth-seeded Richard Fromberg, a 
4-6, 6-1, 6-4 winner over Jaime Yzaga of Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Brad Gilbert was upset by Argentina's Horacio de la Pena, 6-2, 
6-4 in the second round of the Austrian Open, in Kitzbuehel, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Boris Becker had little problem with Claudio Pistolesi, defeating 
the Italian, 6-2, 6-1.

SAMPRAS PIERCES OPPONENT'S POOR SERVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brad Pearce may have reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, where he lost to 
top-seeded Ivan Lendl, but that didn't make him any more formidable in the eyes 
of Pete Sampras, a first-round loser at the All-England Club. 
</P>
<P>
After beating Pearce, 6-2, 2-6, 6-4, in a second-round match at the Volvo/Los 
Angeles tournament Wednesday at UCLA, the third-seeded Sampras admitted that 
the match was "a little tougher than I thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
Why so confident? 
</P>
<P>
"Because he doesn't have a serve that's going to overpower me," Sampras said of 
Pearce, a former UCLA All-American from Provo, Utah. "It's kind of a serve he 
kind of just gets in, and then (he) gets to the net. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like (Boris) Becker's serve, where he's going to ace me two or three 
times a game. It's kind of a serve that, it was only a matter of time before I 
connected on some returns, and that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
After Pearce broke him twice in the last three games of the second set, then 
held serve in the opening game of the third, Sampras held serve without losing 
a point in the second game, then broke Pearce in the third, aided by a double 
fault by Pearce at 15-30. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras served out the set to advance to the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was just a matter of time before I was going to break him again," 
Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
Told of his opponent's comments, Pearce said: "I'm sure he did feel that way 
because I wasn't really serving that consistently. You might have seen the 
percentages." 
</P>
<P>
They showed that Pearce put his first serve into play 52% of the time and lost 
on 54% of his second serves. 
</P>
<P>
"I know when I'm playing somebody who's serving like I was today, I'd feel the 
same way he did," Pearce said of Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
Only a concentration lapse kept him from an easier win, Sampras said. "I got a 
little frustrated with some line calls." 
</P>
<P>
It's the mental part of his game, Sampras said, that needs fine-tuning as he 
prepares for the Aug. 27 start of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
After overpowering Pearce in the first set, twice answering with aces at break 
point in the eighth game, Sampras seemed to lose interest in the second, losing 
the sixth game of the second set at love. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty evident out there today," said Sampras, two weeks shy of his 
19th birthday. "I played a good first set, then lost my concentration. And 
before I knew it, I'd lost the second set." 
</P>
<P>
What can he do to correct it? 
</P>
<P>
"You can't practice it," he said. "You've just got to stay focused the whole 
match and it's very tough to do. (Jimmy) Connors was probably the best ever at 
that. But look at the top guys -- Becker and (Stefan) Edberg. They still have a 
tendency to lose their concentration. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm doing it much more than they are." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Michael Chang beat Andrew Sznajder of Canada, 6-2, 6-3, and will 
rest today. After winning three three-set matches in as many days last weekend 
to win the Canadian Open, Chang played an exhibition against Andre Agassi 
Monday night in Lake Tahoe, then played at UCLA Tuesday and Wednesday. What 
does he plan to do today? "Just kind of veg out," he said. Actually, he said 
he'll probably practice for about an hour. . . . Dan Goldie, a former NCAA 
singles champion from Stanford, upset sixth-seeded Jean Fleurian of Paris, 6-7 
(7-3), 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, overcoming a 5-1 deficit in the second-set tiebreaker. 
Goldie will play Chang Friday in the quarterfinals.

Pete Peterson, general manager of the New York Yankees, said he expects Hank 
Steinbrenner to take an active role in the team's baseball affairs, as his 
father, George Steinbrenner, did. 
</P>
<P>
"If I want to make a move, a trade or player acquisition, or bring a player up 
from triple A, I'll talk to Hank and then we'll make a decision on the 
direction we want to go," said Peterson, who runs the team's front office along 
with George Bradley, the vice president of player personnel.

Oklahoma running back Mike Gaddis has not recovered from a knee injury that cut 
his season in half last year and will miss the entire 1990 football season, 
Coach Gary Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on my observation and some conversation with the doctor and Mike, I 
don't feel he will be ready to participate at all this coming season," Gibbs 
said. "He's not nearly where he needs to be. He has a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Gaddis, a junior from Midwest City, will have one year of college eligibility 
remaining because he used 1987 as a redshirt year. 
</P>
<P>
Gaddis was the nation's second-leading rusher last season through six games 
with 829 yards when he injured his knee against Texas.

The Florida Athletic Commission is investigating the management team of Olympic 
silver medalist Roy Jones Jr. in connection with an impostor Jones knocked out 
July 14 during a fight at Pensacola, Fla., the panel's chairman says. 
</P>
<P>
State Attorney Curtis Golden has filed fraud charges against the manager for 
Anthony Waddles, the boxer who impersonated another fighter, and a matchmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Golden has found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Square Ring Inc., a 
Pensacola company that manages Jones, but the Athletic Commission is looking 
into possible non-criminal violations, Chairman Richard Wittcoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Waddles, 19, of Norman, Okla., a loser in his only three professional fights, 
allegedly posed as Derwin Richards of Houston, the junior middleweight champion 
of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 21, knocked out the impostor at 2:02 of the first round of the fight in 
Pensacola, Jones' hometown, to run his record to 9-0. Officials didn't realize 
the floored boxer wasn't Richards until two days later. 
</P>
<P>
Waddles is cooperating with authorities and has not been charged with any 
crime.

The word a few months ago was that Wayne Lukas had a 2-year-old filly in his 
well-populated stable he thought was capable of winning the Breeders' Cup 
Juvenile Fillies later this year in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not Cuddles is successful Oct. 27 at Belmont Park remains to be 
seen, but the Mr. Prospector filly is off to a good beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Nine days after breaking her maiden by seven lengths at Hollywood Park, Cuddles 
became a stakes winner when she won the $81,525 Junior Miss Stakes here 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden confidently by Pat Valenzuela, the even-money favorite tracked 
pacesetter Profit System, then took command in the final eighth of a mile to 
win by three lengths in 1:09 3/5 for the six furlongs. Dragonetta, a 6-1 shot, 
rallied to finish second, beating Profit System a neck. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second victory in three starts for Cuddles, who is owned and was 
bred by William T. Young's Overbrook Farm. In her June 16 debut, she broke 
poorly, then raced greenly and was sixth, beaten 14 lengths by Garden Gal, who 
went on to win the Landaluce and was second Wednesday in the Schuylerville 
Stakes at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very good filly," Valenzuela said. "I had worked her for Wayne 
before she ever ran and I told him I really wanted to ride her. But the week he 
entered her, I was suspended. I begged Wayne not to run her, but he said she 
needed a race. So, he ran her and she didn't run well. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to him and asked him if I could ride her back when she ran the next 
time. He let me and she won easy on closing day at Hollywood. I knew the way 
she finished the other day, she'd be double tough today. I knew I had (Profit 
System) because this filly really kicks in when you ask her." 
</P>
<P>
Lukas left Wednesday for Chicago, where he will saddle Steinlen in Saturday's 
Arlington Challenge Cup, so assistant trainer Randy Bradshaw greeted Cuddles in 
the winner's circle. Two races earlier, the barn had staged a 21-1 upset when 
Nimitz came from far back to win a $50,000 maiden contest. 
</P>
<P>
"The filly ran well," Bradshaw said. "She stumbled a little leaving the gate, 
but she was content to rate off the pace, and when (Valenzuela) called on her, 
she finished very well. 
</P>
<P>
"She was kind of small and immature at first, but she's steadily developed and 
gotten a lot better. It looks like every time she starts, she gets better. 
We'll probably keep her here and go through the stakes schedule (the Sorrento 
Aug. 15 and the Debutante Sept. 2)." 
</P>
<P>
Profit System, who was Bill Shoemaker's first stakes starter as a trainer, 
couldn't quite hold off Dragonetta after showing the way through :21 4/5 and 
:44 1/5 fractions. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, she's quick," said David Flores. "The first time I rode her, she really 
came out of there, but today, she really surprised me with her speed. She can 
really go. She got tired the last part, but the race will help her. She'll be 
better next time." 
</P>
<P>
Nice Assay, a maiden, was fourth, then came Unstrained Silver, Lite Light, 
Freedom Cry, Passion For Poker and Sawsan, who turned in her second bad race in 
a row after winning her first two starts.

17.9% RISE IN COUNTY MURDER RATE MIRRORS NATIONAL TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County's murder rate soared 17.9% during the first six months of 
this year, part of a nationwide trend that is projected to break a decade-old 
record for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Chief Medical Examiner Lawrence Cogan told the U.S. Senate Judiciary 
Committee this week that the escalating rate of murders -- 1,168 in the first 
six months of 1990, as contrasted with 991 for the same period last year -- 
does not appear to be slowing down in July and August. He said the county has 
about 2,000 homicides a year. 
</P>
<P>
Cogan generally blamed the availability of highly lethal assault weapons, drugs 
and social factors -- such as youth gangs -- for the rising murder rate. 
Statistics, he told the committee, don't convey the "human suffering of 
families when they experience a sudden violent death," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't convey the retaliatory, youth-gang killings and random drive-by 
shootings or the deaths of bystanders caught in gunfire," Cogan said in 
testimony Tuesday in Washington. "They don't address the drug involvement 
either directly . . . or indirectly." 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the problem, Cogan displayed an article in The Times 
describing the variety of about 25,000 weapons collected annually by law 
enforcement agencies in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Cogan's testimony dovetailed with a report by the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The panel blamed the abundance of assault weapons and cocaine trafficking for 
the record pace of murders across the nation. If the killing continues, the 
committee projected that 23,220 people will be murdered this year, exceeding 
the record of 23,040 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The current national murder rate of 10.5 per 100,000 residents makes the United 
States "the most murderous industrialized nation in the world," the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said that if the homicide rate continues to 
soar it will make 1990 the "bloodiest year in American history." 
</P>
<P>
Biden urged the House to approve a Senate-passed bill banning nine 
semiautomatic assault weapons and imposing the death penalty for 34 federal 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Cogan's report on Los Angeles County's murder rate was based on monthly 
statistics collected by the coroner's office. He offered no breakdown of 
statistics from individual communities.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICER HIT WITH TAINTED BLOOD WINS 
$250,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury has awarded $250,000 to a Long Beach policeman who sued the county for 
emotional distress after he was hit in the eye with blood contaminated with the 
AIDS virus, his attorney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court jury also awarded homicide detective Ron Pavek's wife 
$67,500. 
</P>
<P>
John Murphy, Pavek's attorney, said that although the detective has tested 
negative for the AIDS virus, Pavek fears that he could pass the disease on to 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Pavek was splashed with the blood during a May, 1987, autopsy on a corpse 
infected with the HIV virus, which causes AIDS. At the time, Pavek was not 
given protective clothing or a mask, Murphy said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW AGENCY CREATED FOR GROUND WATER PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Water officials in the San Gabriel Valley announced Wednesday the creation of a 
new governmental body to help cope with extensive ground water pollution in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
The Main San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority, which represents the 
combined jurisdictions of three key water districts in the region, plans to 
coordinate efforts to solve the contamination problem. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local environmentalists criticized Gov. George Deukmejian for 
cutting $1 million from the Department of Health Services budget that was to 
have paid for the cleanup of badly contaminated water in Azusa and Baldwin 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame, it's unfair," said Maxine Leichter, head of a water quality task 
force of the Sierra Club's Angeles Chapter.

LODGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state civil rights investigation into allegations that the Van Nuys Elks 
Lodge discriminated against black applicants has been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's nine-month investigation found no evidence of racial 
discrimination, Deputy Atty. Gen. Louis Verdugo said Wednesday. Officers of the 
260-member lodge claim that the result vindicated the lodge, but Verdugo said 
the probe was hampered by the organization's secretiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"They take an oath of secrecy as to what goes on when those doors are closed. 
That's part and parcel of who they are," Verdugo said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the lodge admitted two black men recently, making it difficult to prove 
"a pattern of discrimination," he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN CHARGED IN $1-MILLION SCHEME TO FLEECE 
IRS 
</P>

<P>
A West Los Angeles man has been charged with filing false income tax returns 
using real people's names and Social Security numbers as part of a plan to 
fleece the IRS out of more than $1 million, U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Lourdes G. Baird said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Frederic N. Flenner, 48, faces as much as 75 years in prison and $1.8 million 
in fines after his indictment on seven counts of filing false tax returns and 
eight counts of mail fraud, Baird said. 
</P>
<P>
Flenner, who could not be reached for comment, entered a plea of not guilty 
Monday before U.S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Flenner created fictitious W-2 forms and sent them in with 
fraudulent tax returns.

SUIT CHARGES ILLEGAL DELAYS IN PROCESSING MEDI-CAL APPLICATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE 45-DAY DEADLINE IS OFTEN VIOLATED, TWO PUBLIC-INTEREST LAW GROUPS 
SAY. THEY ALLEGE DIRE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Alleging that pregnant women and newborn children are waiting as long as 14 
months for their Medi-Cal applications to be processed, two public-interest law 
firms filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court Wednesday against Los 
Angeles County and the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the delays, many poor women in Los Angeles County are going 
without prenatal care and are giving birth to sickly, underweight babies, the 
suit alleges. Once born, many children are going without immunizations and 
other medical care, it says. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires applications to be processed in 45 days. In March, 
however, 17,000 Medi-Cal applications filed at county offices had been pending 
for 60 days or longer, according to statistics compiled by legal-aid attorneys 
from county records. 
</P>
<P>
"When pregnant women apply for Medi-Cal to cover their prenatal care and still 
have not received a decision on their application by the time their newborn 
babies are 6 months old, there's something seriously wrong with the system," 
said Byron Gross, an attorney for the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, 
which filed the suit along with the Western Center on Law and Poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys with the two law firms said they will seek a preliminary injunction 
requiring the county to process applications within the statutory 45 days. 
Listed as the defendants in the suit are the county Board of Supervisors, the 
directors of the county Department of Public Social Services and the county 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Matsui, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Social Services, 
declined to comment, saying the department had not yet been served with the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Carnevale, principal deputy county counsel, disputed the figures 
cited by the attorneys. He said 87% of the approximately 21,000 Medi-Cal 
applications handled by the county in March were processed on time. 
</P>
<P>
Carnevale added that in most cases a delay past the 45-day waiting period has 
"a minimal effect on the client. Whether or not they're eligible for Medi-Cal 
doesn't mean they won't get medical care. They can get free medical care at a 
county facility." 
</P>
<P>
But Lynn Kersey of the Los Angeles Homeless Health Care Project said that if 
economically disadvantaged patients are denied Medi-Cal, the quality of health 
care they receive declines dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with county health workers who tell them that they will be billed for the 
services, many pregnant women decide to put off preventive, prenatal health 
care, Kersey said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that without Medi-Cal many of her clients are unable to afford 
prescribed medicines such as ear drops to treat their infants' infections and 
vitamins needed during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Four children and their parents are named in the suit as plaintiffs. Edith 
Estrada, 31, has been denied her Medi-Cal eligibility since last November, even 
though she met all the program's eligibility requirements, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint said that as a result, Estrada was unable to receive prenatal 
care during the last three months of her pregnancy. Her daughter, Rubi Garcia, 
was born in January underweight and is classified by doctors as "high-risk." 
Still, the 7-month-old baby and her mother have yet to receive their Medi-Cal 
eligibility, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-area attorneys who work with the poor said they began to notice a 
dramatic increase in Medi-Cal processing delays about a year ago when Medi-Cal 
rules were changed to make more people eligible for the program. 
</P>
<P>
Gross said he and other public-interest attorneys had been meeting with county 
health officials to discuss the delays for the last few months. When the talks 
failed to correct the situation, he said, the attorneys moved to file the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Gross said a hiring freeze -- lifted earlier this year -- at the Department of 
Public Social Services may be partly to blame for the delays. He cited a 
department study that showed the number of pending Medi-Cal applications had 
increased from 7,451 in January, 1988, to 21,806 in December, 1989.

DEBATE RAGES OVER HOTEL PLANNED FOR BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to build a luxury hotel on Santa Monica's public beach has divided 
this coastal city politically, producing more than 15 hours of City Council 
debate over three days with more than 100 speakers marching into City Hall to 
air their views. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members were expected Wednesday night to debate language for a 
fall ballot measure so voters can decide whether the 160-room, $300-a-night 
hotel should be built. 
</P>
<P>
The $42-million hotel, proposed by celebrity restaurateur Michael McCarty and 
hotly opposed by state Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), would be 
constructed on a parcel of beach owned by the state and managed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
By late Wednesday night, city officials had not decided whether to give their 
final approval to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the upscale hotel say it would provide $1 million a year in 
revenue to help clean up the beach and provide, at no cost to the city, a 
community center, an arts and environment center and public showers and 
bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
They also say it would increase public access to the beach in part by replacing 
a private beach club, the Sand and Sea Club, that has occupied the Pacific 
Coast Highway site since the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, testimony from speakers in the council chambers stretched 
into the early morning hours, forcing council members to postpone their 
decision until Wednesday. That hearing was a continuation of one that lasted 
six hours the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the project say the city should not allow a $300-a-night hotel to 
be built on public land. They also claim that the project would add to traffic 
congestion and air pollution and would not provide true public access to the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden, who said he fears that the project would transform the city into 
another Miami Beach or Waikiki, made a rare appearance before the City Council 
Tuesday night to plead his case and offer alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
At times shouting with council members, Hayden said he could persuade the 
county Board of Supervisors to pass a bond measure to raise $3 million to clean 
all county beaches, including Santa Monica. He said he would sponsor a 
statewide initiative drive for the 1992 ballot to create a permanent fund to 
clean all state beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden was a co-sponsor of a provision in the state budget that would have 
allowed the Sand and Sea Club to remain standing until all permits are approved 
for any new development on the site. The governor, however, vetoed that 
provision on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council also was expected to debate whether to include a rent-control 
measure on the fall ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords are pushing for placement of an initiative on the Nov. 6 city ballot 
that would allow rents on apartments vacated voluntarily to increase to market 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights, a political group of tenants that controls 
the council majority, has been forced into proposing significant increases to 
counter the landlords' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The council Wednesday night was considering the exact wording for a measure 
that would allow rents on voluntarily vacated apartments to increase a certain 
amount, and increases of at least 10% for units already at those levels. The 
increases would come in exchange for specific maintenance standards.

CHILD SUPPORT AMNESTY DECLARED; 
</P>
<P>
LEGAL POLICY: DIST. ATTY. REINER DOES AN ABOUT-FACE AND GIVES PARENTS 60 DAYS 
TO PAY OFF DEBTS TO AVOID ARREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a remarkable policy and political turnabout, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner on 
Wednesday announced a two-month child support amnesty program in which 
"delinquent dads and moms" can pay off their outstanding debts to avoid arrest 
and jail. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, appearing at an afternoon press conference with a longtime nemesis, 
feminist attorney Gloria Allred, said delinquent parents will have until Sept. 
30 to settle their accounts before being subjected to intensified enforcement 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner's aides say that about 85,000 parents are delinquent in child support 
payments, many of them more than $1,000 in arrears. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, whose collection efforts have been criticized as inadequate by women's 
groups, for years had refused to implement an Allred-proposed amnesty program. 
He said amnesty would unjustly tread on the judicial system and instead held 
highly publicized "delinquent dad" roundups, resulting in more than 200 arrests 
each Father's Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
At least three times since 1985, Allred led sit-ins of feminists in Reiner's 
office in unsuccessful efforts to meet with the district attorney on the issue. 
Reiner, in the midst of his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic state attorney 
general nomination, finally met with Allred last year and appointed her to 
co-chair a district attorney's child support committee. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he had changed his mind on amnesty, Reiner told reporters, "Well, 
we'll try anything and see if it works. There is a history to this program (in 
other California counties). It's had some success." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner also made no bones about what strange political bedfellows he and Allred 
were. Smiling as the Westside attorney pinned a large button with the words 
"Call the DA" on his lapel, Reiner laughed and told news photographers, "Now, 
here's a snapshot for your scrapbooks." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Reiner put his arm around Allred's shoulder and quipped, "We're off to 
the Middle East to straighten things out. That will be a piece of cake." 
</P>
<P>
Allred, for her part, said only: "I'm very happy to work with the district 
attorney and I'm also very happy to work with anyone else who wants to improve 
the child support program in any county in this nation." 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the program, which took effect immediately, delinquent parents 
can bring their back payments to the district attorney's office without fear of 
arrest or prosecution for being in arrears. In addition, those who can 
adequately demonstrate their inability to pay their full obligation can make 
arrangements to pay in installments. "But it has to be in good faith and has to 
be verifiable," Reiner emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
Delinquents wishing to settle up can contact the district office in which their 
case is pending or call the district attorney's office at (213) 728-1000. 
Defendants with outstanding arrest warrants are advised to contact Reiner's 
Bureau of Investigation at (213) 725-5072. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-day effort -- officially dubbed the District Attorney's Child Support 
Amnesty Program -- was one of several recommendations made by the advisory 
committee Reiner established last December. The committee, made up of equal 
numbers of Reiner's aides and private citizens, also suggested that delinquent 
child support accounts be reported to credit reporting agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The program had initially been scheduled to begin on Father's Day, June 17. But 
Reiner, who suffered a defeat at the hands of San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo 
Smith in the June 5 primary, was unavailable that week, according to Allred. 
Announcement of the program was then pushed back to Aug. 1, the traditional 
kickoff of national child support month. 
</P>
<P>
During the attorney general's race, Reiner, who lost by fewer than 100,000 
votes statewide, was criticized repeatedly by Smith and women's groups for 
having the worst child support collection record in the state. Fewer than 10% 
of missing parents were located in Los Angeles two years ago, compared to 48% 
in San Francisco, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner's top aides countered that Los Angeles has special problems because of 
its size. Nonetheless, they added, the district attorney's office collected 
$104.6 million last year, more than any other metropolitan jurisdiction in the 
West.

2 TEENS ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF PASTOR IN CHATSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two teen-agers were arrested in the shooting death of a Pacoima pastor who was 
gunned down in his Chatsworth home in a dispute over a minor traffic accident, 
Los Angeles police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dana L. Singer, 18, and Philip J. Dimenno, 19, both of Northridge, were 
arrested on suspicion of murder Tuesday, two days after the body of Carl White, 
54, was found on the floor of his home on Citronia Street. 
</P>
<P>
White was pastor of the Apostolic Temple Church, a storefront church in Pacoima 
with a handful of members. He also was a house painter and a driver for the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Michael Brandt said investigators found recent damage to the rear of 
White's car and learned that he had been in a minor traffic accident Friday 
night. Other evidence led police to the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all based on a minor traffic accident," Brandt said. "It's the craziest 
thing. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason to it. " 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said White had been driving home about 11 p.m. Friday when he slowed his 
car at Winnetka Avenue and Superior Street, about a block from his house, 
because a fatal accident in the intersection had clogged traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Dimenno and an unidentified friend were riding in Dimenno's Mustang behind 
White's car, Brandt said. The friend, who was driving the Mustang, was 
distracted by the accident scene and rear-ended White's car. 
</P>
<P>
Because damage to both cars was minor, no police report was taken and the two 
car owners exchanged information from their driver's licenses. But Dimenno's 
car was uninsured, meaning he could be charged with illegally operating the car 
and be sued by White's insurance company if the pastor reported the accident, 
Lt. L. A. Durrer said. 
</P>
<P>
About 6 a.m. Saturday, Dimenno and Singer -- who had not been in the Mustang 
during the accident -- allegedly went to White's home uninvited in an attempt 
to persuade him not to report the accident, Durrer said. 
</P>
<P>
White's wife, Margaret, was visiting relatives in Canada at the time, and the 
only other person home was an elderly relative who was bedridden and did not 
see or hear what took place when the two men allegedly visited. 
</P>
<P>
"The two suspects just showed up at the house," Brandt said. "We believe it 
started out as a talking situation. They didn't want Pastor White to notify his 
insurance company about the accident. The situation deteriorated and Pastor 
White was shot and killed." 
</P>
<P>
The suspects fled from the house after the shooting, police said. White's body 
was not discovered until the following night when members of the Apostolic 
Temple Church became concerned after he did not show up for Sunday services. 
The bedridden relative was found unharmed in her room and in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe Singer brought a gun with him and shot White. They 
said the gun was seized after the two men were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Both young men lived with their parents, police said, declining to reveal other 
details about them or whether they had criminal records. Singer and Dimenno 
were being held without bail and were expected to be arraigned on murder 
charges in San Fernando Municipal Court today. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret White, who returned from Canada and arrived at her home Sunday night 
as police were investigating her husband's death, said services had not yet 
been set. 
</P>
<P>
The Whites, who were well-liked by neighbors, put their home of five years up 
for sale last month and had planned to move back to Kentucky, where Carl White 
was born, said a real estate agent handling the listing.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: THE BROAD BENEFITS OF AIDS RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The question may be curious or hostile, but it's increasingly being asked: Are 
we spending too much money on AIDS research relative to other diseases? 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, this question seems reasonable. In reality, it's useless. That 
this question is part of the AIDS debate and the inspiration for an emerging 
AIDS funding backlash is potentially tragic. 
</P>
<P>
The responsibility -- the fault -- for this rests squarely with the biomedical 
research community and AIDS activist groups. They have done a truly lousy job 
of articulating the extraordinarily broad range of medical breakthroughs and 
benefits that AIDS research can yield. Instead, they have consistently opted to 
position AIDS in the policy arena purely as a "special interest" disease 
requiring extraordinary measures and an equally extraordinary budget. 
</P>
<P>
No one can rationally argue that combating AIDS doesn't require extraordinary 
efforts. But as AIDS-related research consumes a rising portion of the federal 
biomedical budget, it's increasingly clear that we need to aggressively explore 
the impact of this research beyond AIDS. Although AIDS and its HIV virus is an 
infuriatingly elusive and deadly disease, it is not something wholly separate 
and distinct from other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The biomedical research establishment must start viewing AIDS research as more 
of a gateway into the nature of viruses, the immune system and molecular 
biology. AIDS activists must start building up coalitions with other segments 
of the disease research community -- and not just building up budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"The constituents and advocates in HIV research are just now starting to 
realize the more global aspects of HIV research," says Dr. Anthony Fauci, who 
runs the nation's war on AIDS as director of the National Institute for Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases. "We've reached the point that we're not going to be 
able to say, 'We need more for AIDS' and get more; we have to be able to show 
other benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Although Fauci has personally pointed to spinoff benefits of HIV research, he 
acknowledges that the research community has been so consumed in AIDS research 
itself that there have been few formal efforts to transfer AIDS-gleaned 
insights to other fields. An Office of Technology Assessment survey published 
earlier this year confirmed the obvious: Researchers believed that there would 
be significant spinoffs from AIDS research. Unfortunately, there's consistently 
been a "take it for granted" and "by the way" quality to the discussion of 
spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"AIDS is such a lightning rod," says Fauci. "Spinoffs get lost in the commotion 
and smoke of all the controversy." 
</P>
<P>
But it is Fauci's responsibility -- and the responsibility of the AIDS activist 
community -- to see that they do not. It is in no one's interest to narrowly 
define the impact of AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
The Nixon Administration's War on Cancer failed to generate a "cure" for 
cancer; instead, it spawned the knowledge infrastructure of molecular biology 
that made biotechnology possible and put us in the position to begin to deal 
with diseases such as AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that diseases are not all tucked away in neat, discrete 
compartments. Fundamental structures and interactions make medical research 
more interdisciplinary today than at any other time in history. Precisely 
because we are investing so much into AIDS research, we must take every step 
possible to make sure that the results have as far-reaching an impact as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Virus research in general has become completely dominated by HIV," says David 
Baltimore, the Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist who is president of 
Rockefeller University. The research "has given us a much more precise 
understanding of viral interactions with cells. . . . The one area where it may 
drive technology is in drug design and vaccine design." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Baltimore says, the research is "almost certain to tell us that 
there are types of genetic controls in normal cells that we have never 
imagined." 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a lot of spadework to do in basic research," Fauci says. "We 
have to understand a lot more: the expression of the viral gene and the 
interaction with the cellular gene function." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of basic research has the broadest possible implications. It's like 
learning how to read: Once you can read a short story, learning to read poetry 
or novels is less of a challenge. Fundamental insights into the HIV virus and 
the immune system should be directly transferable to insights into other 
diseases. Fauci argues that AIDS research can't help but offer insights into 
degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis and auto-immune diseases like 
lupus. The opportunistic infections that attack people with AIDS also attack 
people who aren't infected with the HIV virus. 
</P>
<P>
The point is simple: AIDS has become the engine for critical biomedical 
research in this country. The issue isn't, "Are we spending too much on AIDS 
research?" We could ask that of any budget for any serious disease, be it lung 
cancer or Alzheimer's. It is, "Are we getting the maximum return for the 
maximum number of people?" 
</P>
<P>
As Dr. Leroy Hood, the Bowles Professor of Biology at Caltech and director of 
the National Science Foundation's Science and Technology Center in 
Biotechnology, says: "If we're going to spend this much money on AIDS research, 
the mission should be a very broad one." Hood and other researchers want to see 
AIDS money set aside for developing new technologies to enhance viral 
diagnostics and intervention. 
</P>
<P>
None of this should reduce the primary focus on AIDS. On the contrary, a flow 
of spinoffs should consolidate this society's willingness to commit resources. 
Fortunately, even the most radical segments of the AIDS activist community are 
beginning to understand that it can acquire more resources to fight AIDS less 
by stressing the uniqueness of the disease than the insights it offers for all. 
</P>
<P>
"The real bottom line is that we're going to have to make common cause with 
those other (disease lobbying) groups to enhance all of the biomedical budget," 
asserts Mark Harrington, a member of the treatment and data committee of the 
AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT-UP). 
</P>
<P>
"The need to institutionalize the AIDS research process and transfer it to 
other efforts is clear," says Jean McGuire, who runs the AIDS Action Council in 
Washington. "It is a necessary part of building support." 
</P>
<P>
People who challenge the level of AIDS research funding should appreciate that 
an investment in AIDS research isn't an investment in a special interest group 
but an investment in the public health. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for the National Institutes of Health, Congress, the Administration 
and AIDS activists to aggressively encourage a wide array of research spinoffs 
to reinforce that.

REGULATORS PUSH FOR SPEEDIER SALE OF FAILED S&amp;LS, ASSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agency created to oversee the savings and loan bailout said Wednesday that 
it plans to speed up efforts to sell the troubled S&amp;Ls and real estate 
assets it has acquired in hopes of paring inventories by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., said the agency 
hopes to trim its stockpile of thrift institutions by 130 during the next five 
months, leaving it with 337 S&amp;Ls on the federal books. Eventually, he said, 
900 institutions could pass through government hands. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said the RTC also plans an international auction Nov. 15 aimed at 
finding private buyers for $300 billion in real estate acquired in the bailout 
and that it will open a national sales center to help out. 
</P>
<P>
On the block will be some of the RTC's plum holdings, including a golf course 
in Corpus Christi, Tex., and a 300-room hotel in San Antonio, as well as office 
buildings in San Diego, Pomona, Redwood City and Walnut Creek, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a great sale," Seidman told a news conference designed to 
call attention to the stepped-up efforts. "The fall inventory-reduction sale 
has ambitious goals. We certainly intend to go on an all-out effort to make 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson warned 
separately that any "major political storm" over S&amp;L sales the government 
made in late 1988 is likely to "scare buyers and sellers" of insolvent thrifts 
and disrupt the bailout process. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a huge political sound and light show," Robson said, "and the 
potential buyer says: 'I'm a good guy, lived here in Omaha all my life, run a 
good business . . . boy, they haul these guys up and hang 'em in the village 
square, and I don't need that.' 
</P>
<P>
"On the sellers' side, you've got people in government . . . and they look at 
people getting hauled up and shot at and they say: 'Golly, I better dot every 
'i' and cross every 't,' and . . . the process slows down." 
</P>
<P>
Robson said he sees no evidence that criticism over the government's S&amp;L 
deals has had such an impact yet but warned that the scenario is "speculative, 
but not unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Robson also rejected any suggestion that the Bush Administration fears the U.S. 
banking system is on the verge of failure or that the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. fund will not cover expected bank failures. 
</P>
<P>
"The condition in the real estate market . . . is probably the single most 
identifiable element with respect to the banks," Robson said. "But I don't 
think that we or the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) . . . are going around in a 
state of anxiety or alarm." 
</P>
<P>
In separate testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs 
Committee, the General Accounting Office's top S&amp;L expert, Assistant 
Comptroller General Richard L. Fogel, cautioned lawmakers to be wary of 
inflated estimates of how much fraud was involved in the S&amp;L debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning from panel members, Fogel noted that, although fraud 
apparently was a factor in a high percentage of S&amp;L failures, it was a 
major cause or contributor only in a small proportion. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman, too, was cautious in his assessments on that issue, pointing out that 
"where there is fraud, there's usually mismanagement" as well. He said that 
fraud often was a factor, "but not the majority factor" behind the failure of 
many S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
RTC officials said the new national sales center that the agency is 
establishing to handle disposition of its real estate and other assets will 
have offices in Washington and 14 other sites around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas P. Horton, the center's director, said the group plans to have some $500 
million worth of securities, real estate and other assets up for bidding by the 
end of the year. "We're on a fast track here," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC has been under pressure to speed up liquidation of assets it acquired 
in taking over troubled S&amp;Ls. Unless it sells more of those assets soon, it 
must continue to pay interest on them without receiving any income. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the agency faces a companion dilemma: If it moves too 
quickly, it could depress real estate values. 
</P>
<P>

PATAGONIA CATALOGUE JOINS TREND TO RECYCLED PAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Since its 1971 founding, Patagonia Inc. has advocated a "be kind to Mother 
Nature" approach to the outdoors while selling colorful clothing for upscale 
mountain climbers, skiers, hikers and sailors. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Ventura-based company has taken another step designed to win points 
with the increasing number of ecology-minded Americans. It has printed its 
oversize fall catalogue, set to drop into customers' mailboxes later this 
month, on recycled paper. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know how to answer to our customers if we didn't go to recycled 
paper," said Kevin Sweeney, a Patagonia spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia joins a handful of direct marketers, most of them far outside the 
mainstream, that are being prodded by social consciousness or concerned 
customers to get into the environmental swing of things. 
</P>
<P>
Among bigger companies considering a shift to recycled paper for catalogues are 
Eddie Bauer, L. L. Bean and Carter Hawley Hale Stores, the Los Angeles-based 
owner of the Broadway and the Emporium department store chains. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Direct Marketing Assn., it took a spontaneous outpouring by 
customers after Earth Day, April 22, to get most catalogue companies moving. 
The message from customers was loud and clear: Cut down on the "junk mail" and 
the waste of trees or risk losing our business. 
</P>
<P>
"Direct marketers are hearing what's being said," said Lisa Caugherty, a 
spokeswoman for the New York trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the direct mail industry sent out 13.4 billion catalogues in the 
United States, or about 54 catalogues for every man, woman and child. The vast 
majority ended up on the nation's already overloaded scrap heaps. 
</P>
<P>
A few companies and organizations have begun addressing the concerns: 
</P>
<P>
* Esprit de Corp. of San Francisco, which sells its trendy casual clothes in 49 
stores but markets them in big, eye-catching catalogues, earlier this year 
began using recycled paper and is mailing out fewer copies of its catalogues 
for fall than it did for spring. 
</P>
<P>
The company also has hired two people for an in-house "Eco-Desk" charged with 
educating employees and the public about ways to help the environment. Earlier 
this summer, Esprit placed a startling advertisement in the Utne Reader, a 
general-interest magazine, urging customers to "buy only what you need." 
</P>
<P>
* Gardener's Supply Co. in Burlington, Vt., a company that promotes products 
for organic gardeners and mails 7 million catalogues a year, has devised what 
it calls a program for environmental responsibility. It includes funding for a 
catalogue-and-magazine recycling program in Burlington, backing for a nonprofit 
tree-replanting program in Costa Rica and development of a computer program 
that will make it easier to eliminate from rented mailing lists the names of 
customers who don't want more catalogues. The company also is testing a 
recycled paper for its catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
* Artventure, a small marketer of natural fiber clothing based in Berkeley, has 
used recycled paper in its catalogues for three years despite higher production 
costs and lower-quality reproduction, according to founder Tom Asher. 
</P>
<P>
* The Direct Marketing Assn. in February formed a task force on environmental 
issues. It will study problems relating to recycling and packaging, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Many catalogue companies say they have been looking into switching to recycled 
paper for years but have been stymied by the lack of options available from 
paper suppliers. Much of the recycled paper on the market is already spoken 
for, so that catalogue companies attempting to get on the bandwagon now could 
find it difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The companies add that color photos of clothing and other products usually do 
not reproduce as well on the lower-quality recycled papers. 
</P>
<P>
In its new catalogue, Patagonia explains the change to customers in a block of 
italic type over a photograph of rusted, abandoned fuel drums in the Antarctic 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"This (catalogue) is printed on recycled paper. It's not as slick as our former 
(catalogues); the clothes and the photographs may not look as clear and crisp 
as they have in the past. But when we translated the savings into real numbers 
we knew our customers would join us in a willingness to sacrifice some detail 
and clarity." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, a sharp eye would notice a difference between the slightly muddier 
photos in the new catalogue and the crisp, sharp colors in glossier catalogues 
of the past. But the catalogue still has the familiar aura of faraway places 
and outdoorsy types, so it is doubtful that sales will suffer as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia claims that the shift to recycled from virgin paper will save in one 
year 3.5 million kilowatt-hours of energy, 6 million gallons of water and 
14,500 trees. Peggy Bernard, catalogue director for Patagonia, said the paper 
cost was roughly the same. 
</P>
<P>
But even environmentally conscious catalogue companies are finding that there 
are no clear-cut answers. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Newman, president of Seventh Generation, a 2 1/2-year-old company in 
Colchester, Vt., that sells solar flashlights, organic flea powders and other 
"ecologically correct" products, said recycled papers are not a panacea. A 
member of the Direct Marketing Assn.'s environmental task force, Newman said 
recycled papers generally must be bleached with chlorine, which produces toxins 
in the air and water. 
</P>
<P>
"We would take virgin paper that has not been bleached with chlorine over 
recycled paper if we (were assured that the source forests) were being 
replenished," he said. 
</P>
<P>
THE DIRECT-MAIL DELUGE 
</P>
<P>
Companies selling their wares through catalogues send out more and more pieces 
of mail each year, and shoppers respond, to the tune of $25 billion to $35 
billion in purchases by mail or phone. 
</P>
<P>
Estimated number of catalogues mailed in U.S., in billions 
</P>
<P>
1980: 5.8 billion 
</P>
<P>
1989: 13.4 billion

NEWPORT BEACH COIN DEALER UNDER INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hannes Tulving Rare Coin Investments, one of the nation's largest coin dealers, 
said Wednesday that it is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission 
and the California Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Both agencies are looking into the Newport Beach firm's pricing practices as 
well as its guaranty and warranty programs, said Hannes Tulving, the company's 
owner. No charges have been filed against the company, which had sales of $30 
million to more than 4,600 clients in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigations don't bother me," Tulving said in an interview. "We've run 
a clean ship, a clean house." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the FTC would neither confirm nor deny the investigation. 
California Department of Corporations officials could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Tulving said the FTC has been inquiring about the company's operations for 
several months. He said state investigators had made inquiries along the same 
lines as federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the investigations, the Tulving firm was suspended in late April 
by the Coin and Bullion Dealers Accreditation Program, a trade association that 
issues the coin industry's seal of approval. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Stuppler, chairman of the trade group, said it took the action after 
receiving 30 to 40 complaints about Tulving allegedly overpricing coins and 
reneging on a buyback policy. Tulving is the only firm ever to be suspended by 
the trade group, Stuppler said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of March, numerous Tulving clients have seen their investments go 
bad. For instance, the value of coins held by a Newport Beach company's pension 
plan fell from $254,670 on March 1 to just $110,035 on May 25, according to 
financial statements from Tulving. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who are real nervous," said the company's owner, who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Tulving, 35, blamed the price drops on an industrywide slump in the rare coin 
market. He and others say the slump began March 26, when several market makers 
on a national computerized coin trading exchange suddenly stopping bidding, 
causing coins to slip 15% in value. 
</P>
<P>
Among issues that investigators are examining are complaints that Tulving had 
overpriced coins, causing the market drop to be magnified. 
</P>
<P>
"There was something seriously wrong because the value of the coins published 
by Mr. Tulving did not correspond at all with the value of the coins on the 
market," said L. J. Chris Martiniak, an attorney representing several trust 
funds that recently sued Tulving. The case, which alleged fraud and 
misrepresentation, was settled out of court this week. 
</P>
<P>
Some people in the coin industry contend that Tulving unilaterally set higher 
bid and ask prices, thereby keeping customers happy and insulated from market 
fluctuations -- as long as they traded within his system. But with the market 
drop in late March, a rush of sellers short-circuited the system, the critics' 
theory goes. 
</P>
<P>
Tulving denies the allegation and says his firm may actually have underpriced 
coins. Tulving said he studied 676 randomly selected coins and said they were 
sold for $141,834 but were actually worth $192,045 using a relatively new 
national standard for "grading," or assessing a coin's condition. 
</P>
<P>
Besides pricing, investigators are looking at the company's decision to rescind 
a 10-year promise to buy back coins. Customers were notified of the policy 
change in a letter dated four days after the rare coin market fell into a rut. 
Tulving's policy was that it would repurchase any coin for a price consistent 
with its grade. The company also decided to drop a 60-day return privilege as 
well as a one-year guarantee of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in a number of lawsuits against the company, buyers charge that they were 
misled. 
</P>
<P>
"None of this was disclosed to investors," said Martiniak. 
</P>
<P>
Tulving said the decision to change the buyback policy was made well before the 
market drop, even though customers did not find out about it until afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it would be better to change the policy beforehand, rather than be 
forced by some agency to do that," said Tulving. "We were never told by anyone 
we shouldn't be making that kind of guarantee." 
</P>
<P>
He said the coin market has changed dramatically in the last year, including a 
new emphasis on a grading standard and the introduction of a computerized 
trading system. To survive, Tulving said, his firm decided that it had to 
change the way it did business. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot dominate and control the coin business," he said.

PARRETTI DROPS BID FOR VAUNTED FRENCH STUDIO

French film group Pathe Cinema, at the center of a bitter fight for control, 
landed safely in French hands Wednesday after Italian businessman Giancarlo 
Parretti dropped his two-year-old battle for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe Cinema director Jean-Rene Poillot said Parretti had agreed to sell his 
46.5% stake in the film group to Chargeurs SA, a French holding company with 
interests in entertainment, textiles and transport. 
</P>
<P>
Poillot said Chargeurs would pay $206 million for Parretti's stake plus a 
separate 52.4% stake in Pathe Cinema it earlier said it was buying from 
France's Groupe Rivaud. 
</P>
<P>
Chargeurs also said it would buy -- for a 16% premium -- the remaining 1.1% of 
Pathe Cinema that is publicly held. The Paris stock exchange had suspended 
trading in the shares after the acquisition of the Rivaud stake was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe Cinema is not to be confused with Pathe Communications, the Beverly Hills 
company Parretti is using in his attempt to buy MGM/UA Communications Co. 
Market analysts said Parretti could be in need of funds as he pursues MGM/UA, 
but Parretti spokesman Craig Parsons said the French sale should have little 
impact on that. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether the funds will be used toward MGM/UA or not, I can't say," Parsons 
said. "But whatever the dollar amount is, it doesn't seem to be of major 
magnitude compared to the $1.3-billion (MGM/UA purchase price)." 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the French deal, the Beverly Hills company will be allowed 
to continue using the Pathe Communications name, Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Parretti's stake in Pathe Cinema marks the end of a 25-month tussle 
of wills between Parretti and the French government, which was determined to 
keep an intrinsic part of France's cultural heritage out of the Italian 
businessman's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe Cinema, which produced such cinematic masterpieces as Luchino Visconti's 
1963 film, "The Leopard," and Federico Fellini's "La Dolce Vita" in 1959, has a 
library of 250 films and a network of 150 movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Parretti was to take a stake in Pathe Cinema in 1988, when Rivaud agreed to 
sell 52.3% to Max Theret Investissement, in which Parretti holds about 30%. But 
the French government blocked the deal, and Rivaud took back the stake in 
November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Last May Rivaud agreed to sell its stake in Pathe Cinema to Pathe France 
Holding. But Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said during a parliamentary 
debate on drug money laundering that he wanted more information on the origins 
of Parretti's money before deciding on the deal. Finally, on June 15 he 
torpedoed the takeover, saying it might "threaten public order." 
</P>
<P>
The "public order" clause is one of the few grounds on which the government is 
allowed to block a bid from within the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Chargeurs is not new to the world of entertainment. It sold a stake in a French 
television channel in May but retains a 13% stake in British Satellite 
Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
It also owns part of AMLF, a film distribution network, and 50% of film group 
Renn Productions. The brother of Chargeurs Chairman Jerome Seydoux, Nicolas 
Seydoux, is chairman of Gaumont, a leading French film company. 
</P>
<P>
Chargeurs is flush with cash after selling a large stake in UTA, a domestic 
French airline, to Air France earlier this year.

Two Ex-Hughes Employees Indicted: The Justice Department and the Arizona 
Attorney General's Office said two former employees of Hughes Aircraft were 
charged with conspiring to defraud the Environmental Protection Agency by 
concealing information about hazardous waste accidents. The two, Robert E. 
Morrison of Longmont, Colo., and Jay L. Barnett of Tucson, worked at a Hughes 
Aircraft Missile Systems Group factory in Tucson. Hazardous waste was released 
into the environment from treatment units that the two men allegedly were 
supervising, the indictment said.

ECONOMIC INDICATORS SHOW ONGOING SLOWNESS, NO RECESSION

The government's main economic forecasting gauge failed to budge in June, the 
Commerce Department said Wednesday in a report that analysts said portended a 
listless economy in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The department's index of leading economic indicators, designed to forecast 
economic activity six to nine months in advance, was unchanged for the second 
month this year. It had risen in March and May and fallen in February and 
April. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists had expected a small increase in June. If the index were to 
fall for three straight months, it could signal a forthcoming recession. 
</P>
<P>
"This meandering is consistent with what is happening in the economy," said 
economist Darryl Delano of Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass. "It all nets out 
to basically nothing." 
</P>
<P>
David Berson, chief economist with the Federal National Mortgage Assn., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, what we've seen over this year is small increases, small decreases, 
with everything averaging around zero," Berson said. "The economy is going to 
continue in its slow-growth path." 
</P>
<P>
But other analysts, such as David Jones, an economist with the New York 
securities dealer Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., expressed deeper concern. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have got is an economy that is slowly sinking into possibly a mild 
recession by either late this year or early next," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration predicted earlier this month that the nation's economy 
would grow 2% this year. 
</P>
<P>
But the growth rate as measured by the gross national product was just 1.7% in 
the first quarter and 1.2% in the second, meaning the economy would have to 
expand at an annual rate of 2.9% during the second half of the year to meet the 
Administration's prediction. 
</P>
<P>
Few economists expect that amount of growth. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the National Assn. of Purchasing Management released a survey Wednesday 
showing that the manufacturing economy slumped in July for the first time in 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
And the Commerce Department, in another report Wednesday, said construction 
spending in June was flat after falling during the previous two months. 
</P>
<P>
The purchasing managers index fell to 47.7% in July from 51.1% the previous 
month, ending three months of increases. A reading below 50 indicates that the 
manufacturing economy generally is declining. 
</P>
<P>
The index, a composite of survey results on order levels, prices, inventory and 
other areas, had been below 50 for 11 straight months. It averaged 48.8% in the 
first seven months of 1990. July's reading was the lowest since 45.2% in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
The decline was the sharpest since the index fell about nine percentage points 
in early 1984, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
Orders from manufacturers tumbled to 46.2% from 54.9% in June. The rate was the 
lowest since January "and will undoubtedly weaken, if not decrease, the recent 
modest growth in production," the association said. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department's construction spending report showed that spending on 
new construction was unchanged in June at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$447.5 billion after falling in each of the two preceding months. 
</P>
<P>
Spending had dropped 0.3% in May and 1.9% in April. 
</P>
<P>
Both the building and manufacturing sectors have borne the brunt of high 
interest rates as the Federal Reserve attempted to stem inflation by slowing 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The June leading indicators report dashes almost all hope that the economy 
will pick up steam later this year," said Richard W. Rahn, chief economist with 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"The weak industrial sector will get even weaker by year's end as 
manufacturers' new orders fall and growth in unfilled orders wanes," Rahn 
added. "It would take only a mild amount of order cancellations to stop growth 
in industrial production and turn a weak economy into recession." 
</P>
<P>
Both manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and unfilled orders were 
among the negative statistics in the June report. Others were a decline in the 
money supply, a drop in an index measuring consumer confidence, a decrease in 
orders for new plants and equipment and an increase in weekly unemployment 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence index also was negative in May, leading some analysts 
to fear that consumers were retrenching. Consumers account for two-thirds of 
the nation's economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, only four of June's leading indicators were positive: an increase 
in the price of raw materials, higher stock prices, an increase in building 
permits and slower business delivery times. The length of the average workweek 
was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The various changes left the index at 146.0% of its 1982 base of 100 and up 
1.4% from its level a year ago.

U.S., JAPAN OK TELECOMMUNICATIONS PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The United States and Japan forged an agreement Wednesday to open the Japanese 
market to further inroads by U.S. telecommunications firms. 
</P>
<P>
The detailed pact, based on a March 30 accord that helped Japan avoid the 
threat of U.S. trade sanctions, is designed to allow foreign manufacturers to 
provide sophisticated international telecommunications services and equipment 
in the largely closed Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators faced an Aug. 1 deadline for reaching the final agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications accord would open the Japanese market for products known 
as network channel terminating equipment, used by computers to talk over phone 
lines. It would eliminate many of the obstacles that Japan has erected to 
prevent U.S. companies from providing communications networking services, such 
as voice mail and electronic banking, directly to Japanese companies involved 
in international communications. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement only applies to international communications in and out of Japan, 
which is not required to open up its domestic market to foreign 
telecommunications firms. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials estimated that American companies, which serve only about 4% of 
the market for Japan's international telecommunications, could win a 
substantial share of a services market expected to grow to more than $2.5 
billion annually during the next few years. They also expect U.S. firms to make 
strong inroads into the $750-million market for equipment as well. 
</P>
<P>
"This agreement represents an important step toward giving U.S. firms in Japan 
access comparable to the access Japanese firms enjoy in the United States," 
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies will be able to communicate electronically -- internally, among 
affiliates and with regular customers and suppliers -- essentially free of 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, U.S. manufacturing, financial and other firms that do business 
with Japan should be able to run those operations more easily and 
economically," Hills said. 
</P>
<P>
She said Japan also promised to take safeguards against anti-competitive 
conduct in the telecommunications services sector. 
</P>
<P>
"These agreements will play a growing role in maintaining the competitiveness 
of American firms in providing benefits for consumers worldwide," Hills said.

PPG TO PAY $80 MILLION FOR CHROMIUM CLEANUP

A chemical maker has agreed to clean up homes and businesses contaminated with

PPG Industries Inc. of Pittsburgh also consented to pay a $2.5-million fine and

go a long way toward revitalizing Jersey City." 
</P>
<P>
The state blamed the company and two other firms for the chromium contamination 
of homes and businesses in Jersey City. 
</P>
<P>
Exposure to chromium can damage lungs, livers and kidneys.

HIGH TECH TO STREAMLINE PROBATE IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the first efforts nationwide to achieve a "paperless courthouse," the 
probate department of Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana has purchased a 
$1.3-million computerized document processing system. 
</P>
<P>
Made by Costa Mesa-based FileNet Corp., the system uses a scanner to 
electronically store huge volumes of paper documents on an optical disk storage 
system, which can be used to index the files in a database and retrieve 
appropriate documents within seconds of a request. 
</P>
<P>
Estate examiners, lawyers and litigants often have to wait in line to view 
wills, estates and other documents. Court officials say, however, that the 
FileNet system will allow more than one person to view a document at the same 
time and, for courtroom staff, eliminate the tedious task of filing and and 
retrieving documents. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first court we're aware of that will use an imaging system," said 
Ted Smith, chairman and chief executive of FileNet. "It can improve the 
efficiency of the criminal justice system." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Granville, county clerk, described the system as "a first step toward a 
completely paperless courtroom. As such, it represents a breakthrough not only 
in streamlining our operations but also in controlling costs." 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 cases are filed each year in the probate department. When the 
system goes on-line in February, about 8,500 active files made up of roughly 
844,000 pages will be available for viewing and printout within seconds. The 
system has the capacity to store more than 14 million pages. 
</P>
<P>
FileNet will install 40 terminals throughout the probate, mediation, 
investigative services and the county mental health departments. Three 
terminals will be available for public use in the probate department starting 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
FileNet officials said the processing system could be used as a model for other 
courts around the country. The Federal State Justice Institute has commissioned 
a study and a cost/benefit analysis on the impact of the technology on court 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Slater, executive officer of the Orange County Superior Court, said he 
hopes to install the system in all county courts. Eventually, he hopes legal 
professionals will be able to access the records from their offices via 
personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
"Paperless courthouse may be a misnomer," Slater said. "But there certainly 
will be a 'less-paper' environment." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that the idea of a "paperless office" has not advanced as far as he 
originally expected when he first formed FileNet in 1982. But he said the 
industry is on the edge of exponential growth and analysts estimate it could be 
a $3.2-billion market worldwide by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
FileNet has installed more than 350 document processing systems in 28 
countries. The applications span 18 different industries from banking to 
manufacturing, but the company focuses on selling to businesses or government 
agencies that are paper-intensive.

RTC CHIEF BACKS OFF $500-BILLION FIGURE FOR S&amp;L BAILOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Resolution Trust Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, seeking to reverse an 
impression he left earlier this week, disagreed Wednesday with estimates by 
private forecasters that the savings and loan bailout will cost $500 billion 
once all the bills are in. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, he agreed with projections by the Administration that the 
cost of the bailout could run $90 billion to $130 billion, plus $70 billion or 
so in interest costs. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman told a television interviewer Monday that he agreed with estimates by 
the General Accounting Office and some private forecasters that the total tab, 
including interest, could climb "in excess of $500 billion." 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday the RTC chairman told reporters that he was merely trying to 
suggest that "you can come up with any number you want" if you stretch out 
interest payments enough. "I would not say the cost is in excess of $500 
billion, and I don't believe I said that," he said.

ART BUCHWALD: ROUNDING UP SUSPECTS IN S&amp;L HEIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Numerous questions are now being asked in this country about who is responsible 
for the half-trillion-dollar savings and loan scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Before we continue the witch hunt, we have to realize that there are many who 
are innocent until presumed guilty -- but there are even more who are guilty 
until presumed innocent. 
</P>
<P>
The White House is dealing with the problem like an adult by blaming the fiasco 
on the Democrats. The reason the White House is so sure that the Democrats are 
behind the S&amp;L loss is because this is going to be a big issue in the fall 
elections. The President's position is that, when you have a disaster of this 
magnitude, there is never enough political blame to go around. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats are certain that the Republicans destroyed the nation's mortgage 
banking system when they deregulated the S&amp;Ls and permitted them to give 
money to anyone who wanted to build a chocolate bunny factory. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that the Democrats intend to lay the S&amp;L boondoggle on 
the Republicans' doorstep, even if it means blaming the President's son. 
</P>
<P>
There is so much mudslinging about this scandal because no matter where a 
congressman or senator comes from, there was at least one S&amp;L down the 
block. Some of our politicians' best friends were also some of the politicians' 
most generous contributors. 
</P>
<P>
To quote bank robber Willie Sutton for the 1,000th time, "The reason that 
members of Congress gave the S&amp;Ls everything they wanted was because 
'That's where the money was.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows the amount of campaign funds that changed hands during the '80s, 
when the S&amp;Ls were permitted to do anything they wanted. But there is no 
doubt that the relationship between the banks and elected officials was warm, 
sympathetic and user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
If it's true that there will be a war between Republicans and Democrats over 
the multibillion-dollar deficit, then this is the kind of rhetoric we can 
expect to hear. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican TV commercial would go something like this: pan to a man opening 
a safe which turns out to be empty. 
</P>
<P>
He says, "This savings and loan bank has been cleaned out. Who, you ask, did 
it? Well, I'll tell you who. Willie Horton stole your savings. The Democrats 
have been soft on S&amp;Ls for years, and that's why it's going to cost every 
man, woman and child in the U.S. $4,000 each, so that Willie can get a weekend 
furlough to go to Disney World." 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic commercial would show a bunch of fat S&amp;L owners with grease 
all over their faces eating legs of lamb with their bare hands. The voice-over 
would say, "This is a $10,000-a-plate dinner for the National Republican Party 
given by the savings and loan industry. If it hadn't been for Reagan 
deregulation rules, we wouldn't be eating lamb while you eat Alpo this evening. 
Let's make the government get onto the S&amp;Ls' backs once again. If you add 
up what it will cost you, flag burning is no longer this country's burning 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
The White House is very sensitive about the S&amp;L bailout, and this is 
because the President's son, Neil, is involved with an S&amp;L scandal in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that no one understands, the Democrats are making hay with this 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week a Democrat called me. He told me that he had heard the White 
House was going to install drive-in S&amp;L deposit windows at 1600 
Pennsylvania Ave. for the convenience of lobbyists trying to get their message 
to the President. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, everyone is agreed on one thing: The guilty should be punished 
and, at the very least, be ex-communicated by Cardinal O'Connor.

MAGAZINES: LETTER OF LAW APPLIED TO PRO BONO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many observers would agree that the scales of justice in America are easily 
tipped by cash. To help elevate inequities, law firms are supposed to offer 
freebie service to deserving but impoverished clients and causes. 
</P>
<P>
That's what they're supposed to do. 
</P>
<P>
For the past five years, American Lawyer has charted the country's most 
lucrative law firms, listing them according to how much cash they bring in -- 
in some cases, more than $1 million per partner. 
</P>
<P>
This year, though, the editors also decided to check up on how much pro bono 
publico ("for the public good") work the firms do. 
</P>
<P>
Their conclusion: "Every firm claims to be deeply committed to doing pro bono. 
In practice, many of the richest and most successful firms are doing the 
minimum." 
</P>
<P>
Here in Los Angeles, the big firms are even more parsimonious with their time 
than are firms elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
American Lawyer rated 100 of the nation's most prosperous, prestigious law 
firms on a scale of A to D, based on the number of hours of work donated per 
lawyer and the number of lawyers in a firm involved in doing 20 hours a year or 
more of pro bono work. 
</P>
<P>
Not a single Southern California firm made an A on the list, "a troubling sign 
from a city that has housing and homeless problems that compare with New York's 
and a burgeoning population of refugees and illegal aliens who need assistance 
in seeking asylum or legal immigration status," the editors write. 
</P>
<P>
The prestigious firm of Latham and Watkins (gross revenues of $223.5 million) 
reported only 16 pro bono hours per lawyer (rating: C), while Irell &amp; 
Manella, O'Melveny &amp; Meyers and McKenna, Conner and Cuneo received B 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers' pro bono work comes in all varieties, from defending poor criminals to 
major "impact litigation" cases designed to change the system. The stories of 
legal altruism in defense of persons with AIDS, the homeless, poor immigrants, 
and death row inmates are inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in a statement issued last April, New York's Committee to Improve the 
Availability of Legal Services stated: "It is grotesque to have a system in 
which the law guarantees to the poor that their basic human needs will be met 
but which provides individuals no realistic means with which to enforce that 
right." 
</P>
<P>
In an amusing accompanying story, "Deep Pockets and Weak Excuses," lawyers from 
some of the nation's top firms try to weasel out of their responsibility, make 
sniveling excuses and openly attack their competitors' records. One lawyer even 
snitches on a competitor who counted the hours he spent getting a green card 
for his housekeeper as pro bono time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REQUIRED READING 
</P>
<P>
* The 1980s saw a "renaissance of racism," complete with old-fashioned bombings 
in Alabama and Georgia. Now it's time to reverse the trend, Julian Bond writes 
in September's Exposure. In an essay anchoring a chilling gallery of 
photographs of racial hatred from Bensonhurst, N.Y., to Pulaski, Tenn., Bond 
denounces "Trickle down racism," in which "thought becomes word; word becomes 
act; act becomes confrontation, and someone dies." 
</P>
<P>
* Get off your collective duffs, Hollywood. There's still time to whip out a 
made-for-TV-movie before the gubernatorial election. It might be called "The 
Dianne Feinstein" story. It could be based on Sidney Blumenthal's darn-near 
adoring profile of the candidate in the Aug. 13 New Republic. But what actress 
could play this woman, this "resolved personality," who, shaped by a life rich 
in tragedy and drama, has fused "empathy and self-control, warmth and 
coolness," into a "mature equilibrium"? 
</P>
<P>
* More than 2.6 million Latinos in the United States now have household incomes 
of $50,000 or more, reflecting better than a 200% increase from 1972. According 
to an article in the August American Demographics, Honolulu has the highest 
percentage of affluent Latinos (25.3%), while the Anaheim, Santa Ana, Garden 
Grove area ranks No. 7 at 14.2%. Los Angeles ranks No. 17, possibly because the 
large numbers of recent immigrants bring down the income averages. 
</P>
<P>
* As the head of Nintendo Corp., Hiroshi Yamauchi is a very rich man. His 
Nintendo stock alone is worth $2 billion. His rising share-price and dividends 
bring in another $4 million a year. But Yamauchi is no Akio Morita (the 
gregarious head of Sony) or Ryoei Saito (the Japanese magnate who's been buying 
up Renoirs and Van Goghs). Rather, Yamauchi's home in Kyoto is relatively 
modest, and in an interview in the August Business Tokyo, he remains aloof, 
almost irritable in discussing the company whose video games have conquered 
America. Of the antitrust cases pending against Nintendo in the United States, 
for instance, he says: "I'm not the judge, so I'm not going to sit here and 
debate it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW ON NEWSSTANDS 
</P>
<P>
* Last year, the classic back-to-nature publication Mother Earth News found new 
owners, got a city-slick make over and moved to New York, leaving a seasoned 
staff in Mountain Home, N.C. Now the old gang has started a new publication 
they call BackHome. Dedicated to "hands-on, down-to-earth, how-to information 
for independent family living," the quarterly is geared to rural folk 
possessing individualism and community spirit. The group editorial photo hints 
at the publication's hippie heritage. But the content eschews pie-in-the-sky 
communal Earth Goddess blather in favor of nuts and bolts pragmatism. 
</P>
<P>
There are articles on the trials of an owner-builder, controling weeds without 
poison, a case study of a citizen's group that fought an incinerator and a 
primer on tool rental. BackHome also features an article, "Ode to a Toad," 
which reveals that, in three months, the average toad eats 9,936 insects. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
RECREATION: WILD FOOD OUTINGS OFFER EVEN CASUAL HIKERS THE CHANCE TO DISCOVER 
WHICH PLANTS AND INSECTS ARE SAFE TO EAT -- EVEN IF THEY AREN'T EXACTLY 
APPETIZING. 
</P>

<P>
Christopher Nyerges pulled a small jar of seasoning salt from his backpack and 
sprinkled some on the salad he had just concocted of weeds. 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked, "Isn't that cheating?" It was halfway into one of Nyerges' Wild 
Food Outings, the time he and his hikers sit down to eat the leaves, stalks and 
berries they have gathered along the trail. 
</P>
<P>
Nyerges, 35, who leads these edible outings every weekend or so, took the 
cheating question seriously. "Everybody always asks something like that," he 
said. "But I don't go by any rules. I usually carry salad dressing, but I 
forgot it today." 
</P>
<P>
Because he tells hikers which wild plants are safe to eat, Nyerges said it is 
often assumed he is trying to make a statement about survival in the 
wilderness. He is, but it may not be the statement one expects. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you live off the land? Of course you can. But that's not what I'm telling 
people they must do. I'm not saying you shouldn't grow your own food or buy it 
at the store," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to promote the idea that there is a lot of food, and actually 
a lot of resources besides food, that goes to waste -- resources you can use to 
save money, that you can use to improve your diet, certainly that you can use 
if you get lost outdoors. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Nyerges, a teacher at L.A. City College and author of the books "Urban 
Wilderness" and "Wild Greens and Salads," began leading wild food walks around 
the Los Angeles area in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Saturday morning, a small group met at an Upper Arroyo Seco trail 
head, at the end of a suburban block in Altadena. Nyerges often leads his 
edible outings in this area because it's an easy canyon to get people in and 
out of without strenuous climbing. 
</P>
<P>
The groups generally include six to 30 walkers of all ages who pay $10 each for 
the privilege of sharing Nyerges' hiking and edible-hunting expertise. Nyerges 
tailors his presentation to the participants' level of outdoor sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing he pointed out on this tour was a common plant in the area: 
poison oak. He taught the walkers how to recognize the plant's distinctive 
leaves, which were turning red and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
"You can touch the bare stalks even in the wintertime and get a rash," he said. 
Yet Nyerges eats poison oak without ill effects. "Many of the Indian tribes ate 
it also and developed immunity. I usually eat the young, tender leaves that are 
newly emerging. But I'm not recommending it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the history of his tours, he said, only four hikers have suffered reactions 
to their trail-side meals, none of them serious. One, a hiker with an allergy 
to tomatoes, got sick from ingesting some tomato-like berries; three others 
developed rashes after rubbing laurel on their skin. 
</P>
<P>
"When I used to experiment years ago, I vomited up my share (of plants and 
berries)," Nyerges said. "I no longer experiment. (And) I recommend that people 
do not experiment, period. You either know what it is or you leave it alone." 
</P>
<P>
There is a lot to learn, and after two to three hours of walking in Nyerges' 
tracks, amateur outdoor gourmets realize just how much they don't know. 
</P>
<P>
As the group walked by a mugwort plant, Nyerges borrowed some matches from a 
hiker and showed how to rub the leaves into a little ball and light them. 
</P>
<P>
Nyerges, who studied for 12 years with an Iroquois medicine man, demonstrated 
how Indians made huge smoldering mugwort cigars to move fire from one 
encampment to another. 
</P>
<P>
When Nyerges began adding western black nightshade berries to the growing 
collection of leaves and berries in the plastic soon-to-be-lunch bag he was 
carrying, several hikers looked shocked. 
</P>
<P>
"Nightshade is always considered poisonous, but it's no more poisonous than a 
garden tomato plant," said Nyerges. "If you eat the green fruits or raw leaves, 
you'll get sick, but no one even considers eating garden tomato leaves," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Further up the trail, Nyerges pointed out a truly poisonous plant, the lantana, 
which can look dangerously like a raspberry bush. 
</P>
<P>
Nyerges maintains you can use wild plants from your yard or neighborhood for 20 
to 50% of your diet with no significant change in your lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Carob, for example, is a rich source of calcium, and carob trees are common 
throughout Southern California, said Nyerges. Another weed that's found all 
over the world is purslane. Nyerges added a bunch of purslane to his salad bag. 
"I've had it with eggs. I've had it in soup. I've sauteed it with cheese. 
Purslane has a good crisp flavor. And the entire above-ground plant is edible." 
</P>
<P>
When the group reached a small stream in the canyon, the hikers took out their 
bowls, cups and eating utensils. Nyerges showed everyone how to fill their cups 
from the flowing part of the stream, which he has tested and found to be safe 
for drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"But, uh, which bugs are edible?" asked one hesitant hiker. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually all of them," said Nyerges. "But you'll probably eat more aphids 
when you have a salad from a top hotel than you will here." 
</P>
<P>
He took a cutting board and knife from his backpack and chopped up all the wild 
plants he had collected in his plastic bag. He added a piece of a prickly pear 
cactus: "It's got a nice crunch, like a green pepper." 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to say, 'Well, this kind of looks like at home, it doesn't look 
like a lot of slop.' And if you have a bottle of salad dressing, well, suddenly 
it's a real salad," said Nyerges, who concedes that he most always carries 
onions to add to the salad. 
</P>
<P>
While Nyerges tossed the salad, his hikers talked about survival. Could they, 
as individuals or as a group, survive in this canyon for a year? No doubt about 
it, said Nyerges. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're hoping to survive up here totally, there are fish and animals, and 
there are also grass seeds. If you combine grass seeds with legumes, such as 
wild peas, you get a complete protein," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, said Nyerges, people in cultures around the world have used this 
sort of information to help them survive when they were lost or forced to 
evacuate their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Nyerges thinks of wild food collecting as more than something to do with a 
Saturday morning. It is a skill that every city dweller ought to develop, he 
said, noting that all the edibles found on his walks, with the possible 
exception of watercress, can be found on city walks as well. 
</P>
<P>
"People have the idea that somehow in order to collect good wild plants you 
have to go far away from home," said Nyerges. "That's a false idea. I often do 
outings in vacant city lots." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Snider, 40, of Pasadena, has been on several wild food outings. He said 
that even if Nyerges talks about the same plant more than once, he has another 
story about it for each retelling. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't necessarily use what I learn, but I file it away," said Snider. "I've 
taken backpacking classes and amused the other people by grazing on the plants 
as I go. You discover that when you're in a pinch, there's always something out 
there. That's good to know." 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming Wild Food Outings, conducted by Christopher Nyerges and his 
assistants, are scheduled for the following dates and places: Aug. 11, 8 a.m., 
Upper Arroyo Seco, Altadena; Aug. 18, 8 a.m., Millard Canyon, Altadena; Aug. 
25, 8 a.m., Upper Arroyo Seco, Altadena; Sept. 1, 9 a.m., Switzer's Camp. Each 
outing lasts 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Bring a cup, bowl, canteen of water, eating 
utensils (or you'll make chopsticks on the trail) and notebook. Dress 
comfortably. Reservations are necessary. Send $10 (half price for seniors and 
hikers under age 14) per outing to: Survival Services, P.O. Box 41834, Los 
Angeles, Calif. 90041. For more information, call (213) 255-9502.

YOUR WHEELS: A SOOTY MARK ON DEALER DIAGNOSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I was wondering why my car has to have spark plugs put in every two 
weeks? The plugs are coated with black soot and black soot also comes out of 
the tailpipe. It uses a lot of gasoline for a four-cylinder car. The "check 
engine" light comes on, but the diagnostic computer at the dealership says 
there isn't anything wrong with the car. But I know there is. The car is a 1981 
Chevrolet Chevette. -- T.L. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: This is another case of people needing to be smarter than computers. 
Unfortunately, too many mechanics are either incapable of knowing how to use 
modern diagnostic equipment or they don't have the mechanical skills to 
outsmart a computer when it is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The symptoms you describe point to a classic case of the engine getting too 
much fuel. The sooty spark plugs are an indication of unburned or partially 
burned fuel. The black soot coming out of the exhaust pipe is a telltale sign. 
</P>
<P>
Your problem seems to be so severe that it has even degraded your fuel economy. 
If the engine is getting too much fuel and not completely burning it, then you 
obviously are going to lose fuel economy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the easiest ways a motorist can monitor the health of a car's engine is 
to frequently check the gasoline mileage rate. A dropoff will let you know 
something has gone wrong. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of causes of excess fuel being sent to the engine. If your car 
has a carburetor, the float could be stuck or improperly set. The carburetor 
could be otherwise fouled. The choke, which is supposed to give the engine more 
fuel when it is cold, could be stuck and flooding the engine with fuel when it 
is hot. The problem could be as simple as the air cleaner being dirty and 
clogged. 
</P>
<P>
If the engine's computer command system is triggering a "check engine" light on 
the dashboard, it could be indicating the source of the fuel problem or some 
other problem altogether. It could be that the fuel problem is causing a 
secondary problem that is being picked up by the computer. For example, the 
oxygen sensor could be coated with soot, which will trigger the check light. 
</P>
<P>
Solving the problem should be relatively easy. The hard part may be finding a 
good mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please tell me if anyone makes a waterproof car cover. If not, what is the 
reason? C.C.R. 
</P>
<P>
A: To my knowledge, a waterproof cover is not made. Most of the covers are 
nylon, cotton or a synthetic blend that allow water to soak in but also to 
evaporate through. The reason simply is that condensation would accumulate 
under the car and foster rapid corrosion. The best types of covers have a soft 
texture, but heavy body. They should be thick enough to block the sun's 
ultraviolet rays.

CRITIC AT LARGE: ANOTHER LIFE FOR KATZ FILM ENCYCLOPEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ephraim Katz is alive and well and living in New York and, at long last, 
working on a revised edition of his monumental "The Encyclopedia of Film." 
</P>
<P>
These tidings will probably not be universally understood or hailed, but to 
thousands of serious film fans and film journalists, the news is very good 
indeed. The Katz encyclopedia, first published in 1979, is widely regarded as 
the best one-volume compendium on film information there is. 
</P>
<P>
The late Leslie Halliwell's "Filmgoer's Companion," with its far more numerous 
but skeletal entries, is an irreplaceable quick-check on film dates and 
credits. Halliwell, being English, was particularly strong on British actors 
and directors. His own quirky, acerbic personality shines through his choice of 
illustrations, random quotations and really terse (three to five words) 
summations of careers. The "Companion" has also, very use fully, gone through 
several updatings. 
</P>
<P>
The encyclopedist's own personality is largely invisible in "The Encyclopedia 
of Film," but Katz's essays, their length measuring the importance of the 
subjects, are masterfully objective interpretive biographies of the lives and 
work of the men and women of the movies. Other entries deal with technologies, 
terminologies, whatever you always wanted to know about the movies, but didn't 
know whom to ask. 
</P>
<P>
The double-columned pages in small type offer 85 inches on D. W. Griffith, 55 
on Welles, 36 on Hitchcock and 24 on John Ford. 
</P>
<P>
The frustration has been that the world of motion pictures changes with 
unrelenting speed, and Katz's heroic work, unrevised or updated, has had a 
declining usefulness. My list of missing names, scrawled on the endpapers, 
includes Barry Levinson, Peter Shaffer, Alan Parker, Michael Apted, Richard 
Donner and Andre Konchalovsky among several others. 
</P>
<P>
When I read not long ago that a new printing of the encyclopedia was due out, I 
checked to see if it was a revision. It isn't, but there's one coming, as I 
discovered when I tracked down the author to see what the prospects are, and 
how he wrote the encyclopedia in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Katz, who is 58, came to the United States in 1959 from Israel, where he had 
been a precocious film journalist, writing reviews when he was still in his 
teens, working also as a reporter and feature writer. In New York he began 
making documentaries for CBS television and later NBC. One, "The Taste of 
Sunday," he thinks may have been the first color documentary CBS ever ran. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to pursue advanced film studies at NYU, with an eye to teaching. It 
was there he discovered there was no single film reference book that pleased 
him. He took the idea of an encyclopedia to publishers, who were interested. 
Even he, Katz admits, didn't fully realize what he was letting himself in for. 
</P>
<P>
"It was before computers," he says, "I typed it all myself. And I'm a lousy 
typist." 
</P>
<P>
The publishing history has been tangled: Random House was first involved but 
the book went to Crowell and Harper &amp; Row before it actually came out. 
Putnam's did a paperback edition under its Perigree imprint in 1982 and now 
Harper-Collins has reacquired the rights for a fresh paperback edition. It has 
also, at last, authorized Katz to go ahead with a revised edition. The original 
has sold consistently well over the decade and still does. 
</P>
<P>
"It's long overdue, I admit it, and very frustrating for me," says Katz. "This 
time I want to do it all on the computer for them, but so far they just want 
hard copy. But the computer can make it so much easier to update the book. I 
don't think publishers realize how much readers demand current information. 
Movies are such a lively art, you've got to be up to date." 
</P>
<P>
Katz says he's now working 16 or 17 hours a day. He has one principal helper, a 
retired furrier named Benjamin Laba, who like Katz is a lifelong movie fan. One 
of Katz's daughters, who started helping with the book when she was 9, is now 
away at university and unavailable to lend a hand. His other daughter is an 
actress, busy with her own career. 
</P>
<P>
"What I love is satisfying my curiosity, tracking down a fact and saying, 'Aha, 
elementary my dear Watson.' " He once estimated that it takes him 10 hours of 
research to get to an hour's worth of writing. The thing about using a 
computer, he says, is that you never want to stop writing. 
</P>
<P>
There is much to write. The encyclopedia has entries on national cinemas and, 
Katz says with some embarrassment, "I left out Spain. How could I do that? And 
Australia. Poor Australia, just when all those exciting things were happening 
in the movies down there. Don't think I haven't heard about that. They 
complained bitterly." 
</P>
<P>
In the dozen years since he was compiling the book, much has changed. "The bulk 
of the personalities in the book are no longer with us," he says sadly. "Cary 
Grant, Fred Astaire, Welles. . . . For the domestic people getting the 
information is no problem. For the people abroad there is only Variety." 
</P>
<P>
A significant change, Katz says, "is that there now there are hundreds of 
directors who have made only one film, or maybe two. That's very much a 
reflection of the times. The same thing is true of screenwriters, another 
reflection of the times." 
</P>
<P>
He isn't a monopolist at heart, Katz says, but he finds there was much to be 
said for the studios owning theaters so they were assured of at least a basic 
level of income for their pictures. And the studios had their stables of 
writers and directors, who gave even the B pictures a high level of competence. 
"It was reliable entertainment. I don't find the movies as thrilling as in the 
days when the directorial talent manifested itself, and the writing. Now 
someone says, 'We've got Kevin Bacon for a movie,' and an accountant says OK." 
</P>
<P>
Before he got the go-ahead for the revised edition, Katz had begun work on a 
new book, a compendium of information on 5,000 to 7,000 films, less extensive 
than Halliwell's "Film Guide" but, like the Encyclopedia, offering much more 
information on each entry. "Everything I can find out about the making of the 
film will be there -- conflicts, injuries, difficulties, anything special, a 
Herculean task," he says, with the satisfied smile of a man who would settle 
for nothing less. He has put it aside for now, but he'll get back to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Revising the encyclopedia is heartbreaking in one way," says Katz. "I'll have 
to sacrifice some of the people who are in it now. There's no way I'll have 
room for them." The new edition is due out late in 1991 and, as they say, not a 
moment too soon.

LARROCHA, ZINMAN AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strength and delicacy, substance and lightness, steel and gossamer -- the 
familiar antipodes in the musics of Mozart and Ravel -- correspond exactly, one 
has learned over the years, with the achievements and predilections of both 
Alicia de Larrocha and David Zinman. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish pianist and American conductor again revealed these virtues at the 
Hollywood Bowl Tuesday night in a Mozart-Ravel program of uncommon thrust and 
accomplishment. Even those harboring antipathy to outdoor concerts might have 
been moved by this demonstration of expertise at work -- on a night when the 
sound system was unobtrusive, few aircraft passed over or hovered, and 
extraneous sounds, in general, were at a minimum. The Los Angeles Philharmonic, 
playing at its higher standard of attention, care and musicality, proved a 
worthy partner to these distinguished guests. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's transparent and affectionate readings of "Alborada del 
gracioso," the "Pavane pour une infante defunte" and the Second Suite from 
"Daphnis et Chloe". 
</P>
<P>
What came before was no mere warm-up, however. The Overture to "Die Entfuhrung 
aus dem Serail" has exposed weaknesses in many an arrogant orchestra. This 
infectious and clarified performance exposed only Mozartean joys. 
</P>
<P>
Larrocha's latest Philharmonic appearance showed the pianist, a beloved musical 
icon in Southern California years before Ivo Pogorelich was born, maintaining 
her Olympian standards as ever. 
</P>
<P>
She brought to the aristocratic C-major Concerto, K. 503 -- previous 
generations used to call it the Concerto No. 25 -- elegance, articulation, a 
generous palette of colors and perfect weight of statement. 
</P>
<P>
And she did all this within tempos her younger colleagues might dispute as 
lacking bounce or propulsion; in fact, her moderate pacing let the work speak 
as it seldom does, and lent a sense of unhurried inevitability to all 
movements, but especially to the often-rushed finale. May Larrocha -- whose 
playing at 67 still projects the no-nonsense air of the dissatisfied 
middle-aged genius -- be with us another 35 years. We still have much to learn 
from her.

THE OTHER HALF OF SUMMER; 
</P>
<P>
A NEW WAVE OF ISSUE-ORIENTED, OFFBEAT MOVIES ARE READY TO ROLL INTO THEATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT H. BROESKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the summer's high-profile, major-studio movies have been released -- 
most to lesser enthusiasm than expected -- the industry is eyeing the "smaller" 
remaining films with new optimism. Nearly two dozen movies will be released 
between Friday and Labor Day, many of them from independent distributors who 
have patiently waited for the faster horses to lose some speed. 
</P>
<P>
So, along with heavily promoted titles like Tri-Star Pictures' "Air America," 
starring Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr., and much-anticipated projects like 
Paramount Pictures' Jack Nicholson-directed "Chinatown" sequel, "The Two 
Jakes," moviegoers can look forward to a range of issue-oriented or offbeat 
films. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always room for quality and that idiosyncratic film," said Sandra 
Ruch, marketing president of New Line Cinema. Home of the surprise spring hit, 
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," New Line will be releasing "Pump Up the 
Volume," a story about a high school loner (Christian Slater) whose underground 
radio show becomes the focus of a small-town crisis, and "Metropolitan," a 
story of Angst among New York preppies. 
</P>
<P>
"You do the best you can to carve out your own niche," explained Ron Wanless, 
senior vice president of worldwide marketing for the Samuel Goldwyn Co., which 
will attempt to carve out its niche with Cannes Film Festival Gold Palm winner 
"Wild at Heart," which is expected to get a big boost from the success of 
director David Lynch's offbeat TV soap, "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
"Wild at Heart," which stars Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern as young lovers on the 
run, will be launched Aug. 17 with a strong $7-million to $8-million marketing 
campaign. TV spots will be heavy, said Wanless. "And yes, we will take some 
time during 'Twin Peaks.' We're very confident in the film." 
</P>
<P>
In touting "After Dark, My Sweet," Avenue Pictures' chairman and chief 
executive officer Cary Brokaw says, "After an overabundance of action movies, 
we think we have a smart, different, bold sort of movie -- a sexy thriller for 
thinking people, if you will." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the novel by Jim Thompson, whose murky writings are undergoing a 
rediscovery, the film is directed by James Foley ("At Close Range") and stars 
Jason Patric, Rachel Ward and Bruce Dern as three odd people brought together 
by a kidnaping scheme. 
</P>
<P>
According to Brokaw, Avenue will spend close to $3 million to launch the film 
"in its first couple of waves." Pointing to research studies that have shown 
the film has slightly more female than male appeal -- an important element in a 
summer that's been largely dominated by male-oriented movies -- Brokaw 
admitted, "In a slight way, we're kicking ourselves for not opening the picture 
a little earlier. If we'd have known what was going to happen this summer . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the smaller companies have come up lucky with late summer 
entries. 
</P>
<P>
"Teen Wolf" (1985) became one of Atlantic Releasing's top-grossing titles, with 
domestic ticket sales of $33 million. "Dirty Dancing" grossed $63.4 million for 
Vestron Pictures in 1987. In 1988, "Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream 
Master," grossed $49.3 million for New Line. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, while "Batman" and other hits were rewriting the box-office record 
books, Miramax scored a coup with "sex, lies, and videotape," which was last 
year's big winner at Cannes. Filmed for $1.2 million, "sex, lies, and 
videotape" went on to gross $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
"And we only spent $2.5 million on prints and advertising," said co-chairman 
Harvey Weinstein, adding, "What do you think? Isn't that better than spending 
$60 million to make a movie, and another $30 million on prints and advertising, 
and then grossing $120 million?" 
</P>
<P>
"The Unbelievable Truth" is another low-budget film that Miramax hopes will do 
strong late-summer business. The film, made in 11 days on a budget of $200,000, 
is playing exclusively in New York right now where, according to Weinstein, it 
grossed "one-fifth of its budget" during its opening weekend. Miramax, which 
has had remarkable success recently marketing such specialty films as "Cinema 
Paradiso," "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover" and "Tie Me Up! Tie Me 
Down!" is releasing "The Unbelievable Truth" with a campaign underscoring its 
underdog status. 
</P>
<P>
A recent trade ad for the film, which is about the relationship between a 
fatalistic small-town woman and the ex-con who returns to face his past, 
trumpeted: "This summer the seven major studios have spent over $700,000 on 
film negatives. In order to compete, Miramax is unleashing an Unbelievable 
secret weapon . . . negative cost $200,000." 
</P>
<P>
The smaller companies can afford to do some crowing, considering that the 
majority of the big studio's big guns didn't perform as anticipated. Currently 
stalled at the box office: Paramount's "Another 48 HRS." ($76.7 million in 
ticket sales) and "Days of Thunder" ($69.3 million) and Orion Pictures' 
"RoboCop 2" ($40.7 million). 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a handful of titles that were considered alternatives to the 
slam-bang school of filmmaking are making headlines -- especially Paramount's 
surprise sleeper, the romantic fantasy "Ghost" ($51 million in 17 days), as 
well as Warner Bros.' recently released courtroom thriller, "Presumed Innocent" 
($11.7 million during its opening weekend) and the Walt Disney Studio's spider 
thriller "Arachnophobia" ($23.8 million after 12 days). 
</P>
<P>
All of which gives credence to hopes that Hollywood may yet come up with a 
Happy Ending to the brutally competitive summer -- with movies that weren't 
originally considered to be strong enough to survive the shoot-out. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is not to get caught in the cross fire," said Tom Sherak, president 
of marketing and distribution for 20th Century Fox, which released "Young Guns 
II" on Wednesday, and has "Exorcist III: Legion" upcoming. As Sherak points 
out, the original "Young Guns" defied the current odds facing the Western genre 
to gross nearly $45 million when it was released in the summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Fox is banking on the film's cast of "recognizable young stars," led by 
Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips, as well as the 
first film's success -- including on videocassette (300,000 cassettes were 
shipped) -- to rope moviegoers. As an added plus, the sequel is rated PG-13 -- 
making it more "accessible" than its R-rated predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, to promote "Exorcist III" Fox and the production company, Morgan 
Creek, won't be reminding moviegoers of the 1977 title, "Exorcist II: The 
Heretic," which remains one of Hollywood's most notorious clinkers. "Oh, was 
there a 'II,'? deadpanned Sherak, who goes on to stress that William Peter 
Blatty, who authored the original "Exorcist" and wrote and directed the latest 
sequel, "had nothing at all to do with 'II.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, while the 1974 "Chinatown" remains one of Hollywood's most revered 
films, Paramount must market "The Two Jakes" largely as if it isn't a sequel. 
As Barry London, Paramount's motion group president in charge of distribution 
notes, "Its predecessor was so many years ago that it's hard to equate this 
movie as a sequel in the marketplace. It has to stand on its own two feet." 
</P>
<P>
To reach the action crowd for the Chuck Norris sequel, "Delta Force 2," MGM/UA 
is planning a saturation TV campaign that could cost "as much as $5 million," 
said marketing chief Barry Lorrie, who adds candidly, "I don't think what the 
critics think is going to make any difference." 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Warner Bros. are hoping that their Steve Martin-Rick Moranis 
comedy, "My Blue Heaven," will find the kind of audience waiting a year ago for 
late summer comedies "Parenthood" and "Uncle Buck," two Universal releases that 
grossed more than $160 million between them. 
</P>
<P>
"With an August release, you can count on two to three weeks of solid summer 
business -- and then, if the movie's good, you can go into the fall," said 
Robert Friedman, Warners' president of worldwide advertising and publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Warners also has an art-house entry on the way, "Akira Kurosawa's Dreams." 
Friedman said the film will open in two or three cities, then roll out. "And if 
the gods are with us, (it) will hopefully still be playing in September or 
October." 
</P>
<P>
Other summer hopes are being pinned on the children's movie "The Witches" 
(Warner Bros.), the sci-fi thrillers "Darkman" (Universal) and "Flatliners" 
(Columbia), comedies "Taking Care of Business" (Hollywood Pictures) and 
"Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael" (Paramount) and Spike Lee's "Mo' Better Blues" 
(Universal).

NEA PANEL SEEKS CONSENSUS AS TIME PRESSURE BUILDS; 
</P>
<P>
HEARING: MEMBERS OF THE BIPARTISAN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION HEAR TESTIMONY ON 
AGENCY REFORMS. THE GROUP'S REPORT MUST BE FINISHED BY EARLY SEPTEMBER IF IT IS 
TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION ON NEA MEASURES.

National Endowment for the Arts reforms -- ranging from altering grant-review 
panels to assuring that the NEA chairman is exposed to "salvos" but not 
"potshots" from critics -- were proposed Wednesday to a commission searching 
for a consensus to save the federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals by a panel of arts policy experts are expected to be the final 
testimony before the Independent Commission prepares its report to Congress. 
The 12-member body has until approximately Sept. 7 to deliver the report, 
commission officials said, if its work is to have any role in the arts agency's 
struggle to avoid legislative emasculation. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment faces political difficulty in negotiating simultaneous 
legislative actions to extend its life for another three to five years and to 
appropriate money for its operations in fiscal 1991. Its legal franchise 
expires on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Bills in the House and Senate to extend the NEA probably must be acted on 
before Sept. 7 or face being put off until 1991, officials said. Delay is 
likely to make Congress skittish about voting on the controversial arts issue 
so close to election day, they said, and Congress will face a traffic jam of 
other bills before recess at the end of the month.

Appropriation bills to keep an expired NEA alive pending congressional action 
to renew it also will face crucial committee and floor action. 
</P>
<P>
Legally, the endowment can expire but not die; it can be sustained almost 
indefinitely by appropriation bills or what Congress calls "continuing 
resolutions" that maintain funding at current levels. A continuing resolution 
strategy for defusing the NEA controversy has come up for discussion repeatedly 
over the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members, staff and the panel's co-chairmen agreed that the 
bipartisan, ideologically diverse group may find it difficult to reach a 
consensus that will carry weight with the arts endowment's supporters and 
detractors. 
</P>
<P>
The co-chairmen, New York University president and former Democratic Rep. John 
Brademas and Republican Washington attorney Leonard Garment, said Wednesday 
they hope to present a solidified position in which the entire panel presents a 
single set of recommendations -- with minimal public dissent. 
</P>
<P>
Some commission observers said that they were concerned about disharmony 
between the co-chairmen, but Brademas and Garment said Wednesday they have 
developed a productive and cordial working relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Brademas and Garment made their remarks in a brief conversation before the 
meeting began here, in which both men agreed that a report ripped by dissenting 
views or from which some commission members disassociated themselves would risk 
doing further political damage to the NEA. But, they said, a consensus document 
could become a political rallying point -- especially if the report contains a 
practical set of realistic changes in NEA procedures. 
</P>
<P>
John T. Agresto, president of St. John's College in Santa Fe, N.M., and the 
commission's most doctrinaire conservative, indicated that he has no plans to 
propose abolition or surgery radical enough to alter the NEA's fundamental 
mission and appearance. In an interview before the meeting Wednesday, however, 
Agresto indicated he will work for major changes in endowment grant-approval 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
* Stephen Weil, a Hirshhorn Museum &amp; Sculpture Garden official prominent in 
arts-policy analysis, proposed that the arts endowment's function be clarified 
to establish that NEA funding/sponsorship of an exhibit or an artwork does not 
amount to endorsement of it. 
</P>
<P>
Weil also proposed alteration of NEA legislation to make the agency's chairman 
unable to reject individual grants -- leaving him or her the alternative of 
turning down or endorsing entire categories of grants. Having turned down an 
entire category, the chairman would be required to reconvene a panel of outside 
reviewers to screen the applications again. Questioned skeptically by several 
commission members, Weil insisted that the change would have prevented the 
controversies that have befallen NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer when he 
canceled or rejected at least five individual grants since he took office in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless this is done, there will be no end to the sniping" at the NEA head, 
Weil said. Weil said the policy was intended to make it more difficult to fire 
"potshots" at Frohnmayer, but, he said, "my remark about potshots doesn't mean 
the chairman ought not to be subject to (higher-caliber) salvos" of broader 
criticism of his stewardship. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mulcahy, a Louisiana State University political science professor, urged 
major restructuring of the NEA that would do away with the endowment's 
traditional organization scheme, in which the NEA's divisions mirror the major 
segments of the arts. Instead of separate dance, visual arts, music and theater 
programs, Mulcahy proposed NEA divisions organized on the concept of supplying 
multimedia support for a small number of broad arts-related missions, including 
arts education, fellowships, public programs and the like. 
</P>
<P>
Mulcahy also called for opening NEA grant-review panels to non-artists. The 
proposal has been bandied about in public debate over the arts agency since its 
inception in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision-making responsibility of a grant panel is not the same as that of 
a jury at a show at an art gallery," Mulcahy said. "Artistic excellence should 
be important, but not controlling. It's like saying war is too important a 
public policy to leave to the generals. To say public culture should be decided 
on by artists is like saying Pentagon policy should be turned over to defense 
contractors."

'Rockford' Legal Files: The creator of the 1970s "Rockford Files" TV series has 
sued Universal Studios, claiming he is owed $5 million in profits.

The Los Angeles Superior Court suit claims Roy Huggins originated the series 
concept, and was promised 25% of net profits from the detective show. Huggins 
claims the show, which ran from 1974 to 1980, grossed more than $120 million. A

'Aliens' Fight in Court: Sigourney Weaver, along with the director and 
producers of "Aliens," have sued 20th Century Fox Film Corp. claiming the 
studio withheld their shares of the movie's net profits. 
</P>

The Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit claims the film company has breached 
contracts with Weaver, writer-director James Cameron, producer Gale Anne Hurd 
and executive producer Gordon Carroll. Weaver claims she was entitled to 10% of 
the film's net profits. Cameron was entitled to 10.5% and Hurd to 5 %,

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: A BEASTLY LOOK AT THE MARQUIS DE SADE IN UCLA SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight at 8, the UCLA Film Archives will premiere "Marquis," by 
writer-director Henri Xhonneux and co-writer-designer Roland Topor ("Fantastic 
Planet"). This recent French film is all but indescribable -- at least in a 
family newspaper. Let's try anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine a collaboration between Pier Palo Pasolini and the late Czech puppeteer 
Jiri Trnkacq, who have decided to adapt, unbowdlerized, the works of the 
Marquis de Sade, as interpreted by anthropomorphic animal-puppets, their faces 
subtly humanized but their "bestial" natures now transparent. In this conceit, 
"The Marquis" is a spaniel, his jailer a rat, Justine a cow, the prison 
governor a rooster and the hypocritical Jesuit priest a dromedary. The film is 
thoroughly lewd, bawdy, shocking, but often weirdly charming. 
</P>
<P>
And, offensive or "sadistic" as some will find "Marquis," it's not really 
pornographic, since the effect of the puppet-masks, high-style delivery and 
fairy-tale settings renders the idea of sexual license as absurd as possible. 
(One of the characters is the Marquis' organ, with which he has jocular and 
philosophic conversations.) Obviously, Xhonneux/Topor's "Marquis" is both 
exclusively for adults -- and unique. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 206-FILM. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, LACMA's Vincente Minnelli retrospective catches the director at a 
bad moment -- the disastrously cut 1962 inside-Hollywood movie, "Two Weeks in 
Another Town," and a career high point: 1958-59, the years of the 
multiple-Oscar-winning "Gigi" and "The Reluctant Debutante" (Friday) and "Some 
Came Running" (Saturday). 
</P>
<P>
In all these films, especially "Gigi" -- with Leslie Caron as the most fetching 
of Colette's gamins and Maurice Chevalier as the charmingly avuncular 
boulevardier who watches her consort's progress -- Minnelli's craft is mellow 
and assured, even when materials or cast (Sandra Dee as the debutante) don't 
exactly suit him. 
</P>
<P>
"Some Came Running," which began as an adaptation of James Jones' 
writer-come-home novel and turned into the first and best of the "Rat Pack" 
movies, is a particular tour de force. Frank Sinatra makes an alarmingly 
plausible writer and his lowlife buddies top him. As gambler Bama, who never 
removes his hat, Dean Martin has rarely been better. And, as Ginny, a 
threadbare floozy with a skirt too tight and a smile too quick, Shirley 
MacLaine gives one of the most moving and brilliant performances of her whole 
career.

</P>
<P>
BALLET: BEGINNING TUESDAY, THE BOLSHOI WILL BE AT THE SHRINE WHILE THE 
AUSTRALIAN BALLET MAKES ITS FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE SOUTHLAND SINCE 1971. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Local balletomanes have endured a pointe-less summer since the Joffrey departed 
at the end of May. But all that changes on Tuesday, when two major classical 
ensembles open Southern California engagements: the Australian Ballet at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa and the Bolshoi Ballet at 
Shrine Auditorium in downtown Los Angeles. Each has announced its casting. 
</P>
<P>
Last seen locally in 1971, the Melbourne-based Australian Ballet is bringing 
two programs of Franco-Russian repertory staples: the two-act "Giselle," Serge 
Lifar's ensemble showpiece "Suite en blanc" and David Lichine's caractere romp, 
"Graduation Ball." For modernist contrast, there's also Jiri Kylian's intense 
"Return to the Strange Land" and the West Coast premiere of "Catalyst" by 
company member Stephen Baynes. 
</P>
<P>
Back after a three-year absence, the Moscow-based Bolshoi will dance the local 
premiere of Yuri Grigorovich's full-length historical epic "Ivan the Terrible," 
as well as two more familiar Grigorovich works and a program of Bolshoi 
highlights. 
</P>
<P>
Bolshoi principals include a number of artists prominently cast in 1987 -- most 
notably Ludmila Semenyaka, Alexei Fadeyechev, Nina Ananiashvili and Yuri 
Vasyuchenko. In addition, Gediminas Taranda (absent in 1987 but pictured on 
that tour's posters and souvenir programs) and Los Angeles' own Michael Shannon 
are scheduled to dance during the engagement -- but not Irek Mukhamedov, who 
recently joined England's Royal Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Major casting for both engagements is listed below. Performances are at 8 p.m., 
except as indicated.

'PALLADIUM': DIAL 'S' FOR A WINNING SWINDLE AT COURT THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lenore Carlson was on the money when she subtitled her play, "Palladium Is 
Moving," "A Nasty, Vicious Comedy." But surely her tongue was in her cheek as 
she scrawled those words. Half the fun of this "Palladium" at the Court Theatre 
in Hollywood is watching a sleazy bunch of telemarketers get theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The other half is watching them get each other on the way to getting theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The idea isn't entirely new to the stage. David Mamet came up with something 
like it in "Glen Garry Glenn Ross" and so did Keith Reddin -- at least as the 
jumping-off point for his "Life During Wartime" which closed Sunday at the La 
Jolla Playhouse. Carlson's intent is a touch less serious than Mamet's or 
Reddin's (she does call it a comedy), but it's a fiercely funny epitaph to the 
gods of swindle, written in hot ink and stemming (according to the author's 
program note) from some real-life encounters with the breed. 
</P>
<P>
Her setting is simple: a "phone room" operation, somewhere in the vast open 
spaces of Greater Los Angeles. Four telemarketing cowboys are riding herd on 
their preys, reaching out and touching their someones, bilking them out of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars with a mere turn of the dial. Make that 
thousands of dollars. This is not a high-class operation. 
</P>
<P>
It's Nick's operation (Carmen Argenziano), a peripatetic leader of the pack who 
is not happy unless everyone is busy. His "team" includes a fast-talking sleaze 
named Freddie (Gregg Henry) who is into this to support a coke habit; a prickly 
character named Brad (Glenn Plummer) for whom the telephone squeeze is just one 
of several enterprises, and a rookie named Malcolm (Anthony Starke). 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm is at once the most and least interesting -- least to the audience, 
most to the boiler room veterans who can't quite believe how wet this kid is 
behind the ears. Ostensibly, he is an unemployed actor trying to make ends meet 
between jobs. But is he cut out for the roughness of this trade? 
</P>
<P>
Carlson's play has a straightforward spine that eventually pivots on the 
suspense of pondering that last question. For a long time, plot is not the 
issue. Interaction is. She has a talent for muscular, salty language that would 
make Mamet proud. And she fills in the blanks of each character she paints not 
quite by the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
There are fewer surprises in who these people are than in how vividly this 
hand-picked cast brings them to life. Argenziano's Nick is a typically driven, 
coiled, unfocused, sometimes hysterical boss, who is not happy if he isn't 
having a knockdown-drag-out with someone. Henry's unkempt Freddie is vulgarity 
incarnate -- a loud, oily, scared, mean man whose blow-by-blow description of 
how he likes to live is hilarious and repulsive. 
</P>
<P>
So far so good. Most of the first half is designed to humorously establish the 
noxious environment of the room. The real suspense walks in with Plummer's Brad 
-- a bristling sliver of a guy, watchful as a cat and lethal as a stiletto. You 
don't mess with him, although Nick tries to and, to a lesser degree, so does 
Malcolm -- the famous Malcolm, the fish in the wrong pond about to be devoured 
by these sharks. Starke brings a tremulous innocence and vulnerability to the 
role that eventually explode in ways one only partially anticipates. 
</P>
<P>
It's a raw, precipitous tumble to the play's conclusion over hairpin turns. 
</P>
<P>
James Carhart has supplied a neutral office interior, brightly lit by Brian 
Gale. Lisa James' vigorous staging meets this material head on. It's direct and 
punchy, though one might wish for a quicker start out of the gate. That 
problem, however, is as much the writer's as the director's. Carlson's play, 
like a roller coaster, is slow to build in its pull to the top of the curve, 
but swift enough once it's unleashed on the downslope. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson diligently keeps the nasty and vicious going to the end, but to her 
credit, the comedy, which has a surprisingly moral outcome, never sinks into 
self-righteousness. If you're looking for new insights on the subject of sleaze 
or greed, however, you won't find them here. "Palladium" is to be taken at face 
value. It may not be searing satire, but it is clever, gutsy entertainment 
whose well-observed spoofing makes mincemeat of some of today's 
all-too-recognizable realities.

NEW SONDHEIM REVUE OPENS NEW ACTORS ALLEY HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actors Alley found a perfect inaugural song for its new home at the former Main 
Stage Theatre in North Hollywood: Stephen Sondheim's "Invocation and 
Instructions to the Audience" from "Frogs." But the gods invoked in this witty 
ditty were not always doing their job during the rest of the opening night. 
</P>
<P>
The song opens "You're Gonna Love Tomorrow," a new Sondheim revue, not to be 
confused with "Side By Side By Sondheim" or "Marry Me a Little" (though it does 
share three songs with the former and one with the latter). 
</P>
<P>
The first block of tunes, following that exuberant opener, is from Sondheim's 
unproduced first show, "Saturday Night." Though the cast is clad in black 
formal wear, a casual, youthful spirit is evident, especially in the men's 
ensemble performances. But the section was marred by the strain apparent in 
Bonnie Bailey's voice during her solo "This Is Nice, Isn't It?" Her voice 
continued to waver throughout opening night. 
</P>
<P>
Following two intriguing but awkwardly placed "Poems" from "Pacific Overtures," 
Karen Reed returned to "Saturday Night" for "What More Do I Need?," a spirited 
tribute to love blooming in the middle of the New York madness. It was followed 
by Sandy Rosenberg's rousing rendition of the more familiar but well-matched 
"Another Hundred People" from "Company." 
</P>
<P>
During "The House of Marcus Lycus" from "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to 
the Forum," a little joke was made out of the women -- and then one of the men 
-- portraying enticing courtesans in their black formal wear. The men added a 
brisk "There's Something About a War" from the same show and did well by the 
enigmatic "Someone in a Tree," from "Pacific Overtures." "You're Gonna Love 
Tomorrow," from "Follies," closed the first half on a jaunty upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
The second half draws heavily on recent Sondheim shows that weren't represented 
in the other two revues: "Sunday in the Park With George," "Merrily We Roll 
Along" and "Into the Woods." 
</P>
<P>
"State of the Art/Putting It Together," from "Sunday," seemed stiff in Gordon 
McManus' staging, and Gregory Franklin didn't have every last lyric of this 
difficult number firmly in place. But the show rolled along smoothly with the 
grand music from "Merrily" and "Woods." The odd inclusion of individual songs 
from "Company" and "Follies" in the middle of this later material netted uneven 
results, with Joe Garcia doing a condensed but adroitly staged "Buddy's Blues" 
and Christy Botkin delivering a lackluster "Being Alive." 
</P>
<P>
The choral work was generally superior to the solo work, though Gary Reed 
carried off his solos in high style. Musical director Marjorie Poe's piano 
accompaniment occasionally sounded insecure on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
The lighting operator was slow on the draw at several moments. Speaking of 
lights, someone should find a better way to illuminate the house before the 
show than with a bright light pointed directly at the entrance; I felt as if I 
were entering an interrogation chamber instead of a gracious small theater. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, we were told that the house was not wired until 6 p.m. on 
opening night; perhaps some of the technical problems will disappear with time. 
The songs have enough class to make up for the most of the flaws in the 
presentation. It's just too bad that someone didn't catch the typo in the 
program: Sondheim's "songs are the most varied, consistently challenging body 
of work over written for the American musical stage." That's the sort of line 
that will make Sondheim detractors sit up and snicker.

Newport Landing has that slightly glitzy look you can't seem to escape in 
Newport Beach. On the other hand, you get a great view of Newport Harbor and 
the ferries shuttling back and forth from the Balboa Peninsula (where you are) 
over to Balboa Island. 
</P>
<P>
The waitresses are friendly if a trifle slow sometimes, especially when the 
place is busy. It's busy quite a lot. This is a great place for parking 
yourself on a Sunday afternoon. Get there early so you can grab one of those 
seats on the deck. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd tends to be well-but-casually-dressed, the drinks moderately 
expensive and the bar menu mostly undistinguished, with the exception of a 
couple of really good items (the fried calamari and the Cajun fries -- not 
recommended, however, as the base for a night of serious drinking). 
</P>
<P>
The music is usually pretty good; it runs to the two-guys-with-acoustic-guitars 
kind of thing, but that seems just right for this place. Extra bonus attraction 
on weekends are the fabulous Girls, three very talented women who can jump from 
Motown to Bonnie Raitt without any mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
On a scale of three, give it a two-and-a-half for the view and the Girls. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Landing, 503 E. Edgewater Ave., Newport Beach (on the Balboa Peninsula 
overlooking the Balboa Ferry). Open daily till 2 a.m., Mondays through Fridays 
from 11:30 a.m., Saturdays from 8 a.m., Sundays from 9 a.m. (714) 675-2373.

"Cutter's Way" (1981), director by Ivan Passer. 109 minutes. Rated R. The story 
of a crippled veteran, his best friend and their efforts to solve a murder, 
this is also one of the best introspective character studies to come along in 
years, a welcomed island of reality in Hollywood's sea of fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
"Orphans" (1987), directed by Alan J. Pakula. 120 minutes. Rated R. Albert 
Finney as a blustery Chicago gangster who is abducted by a crazed, third-rate 
thief and held in the dilapidated house the thief shares with his younger, 
backward brother. With his Midwestern gangster slang and alcohol-tainted good 
manners, Finney parodies both American films and American values, uproariously. 
</P>
<P>
"The Killing" (1956), directed by Stanley Kubrick. 83 minutes. No rating. A 
band of very serious thugs plan the biggest score of their careers. An urgent, 
no-nonsense, unrelenting film by the man who went on to direct "Dr. 
Strangelove," "2001" and "A Clockwork Orange." DOUG LIST

VIDEO DISCOVERY: BLOODLESS CHILLS AND THRILLS? TRY 'THE HAUNTING' FOR ITS 
PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK HAMILTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it possible to scare the holy geebees out of someone without the use of 
elaborate special effects, fake decapitations and gallons of make-believe 
blood? It is, and it's called "The Haunting." This black-and-white gem, based 
on the late Shirley Jackson's best-selling novel, "The Haunting of Hill House," 
just may be the best supernatural movie ever made. 
</P>
<P>
You never even see the malevolent spirits. Director Robert Wise ("West Side 
Story," "The Day the Earth Stood Still") works the viewer's imagination with 
chilling sounds, suburb cinematography, weird camera angles and dark and light 
shading. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is simple: An anthropologist (Richard Johnson) wants to prove once and 
for all that there are such things as ghosts. So he finds a 99-year-old haunted 
house in New England and enlists the help of two psychics -- Julie Harris and 
Claire Bloom (talk about mega-casting) -- and a wisecracking skeptic, played by 
"West Side Story" and "Twin Peaks' " Russ Tamblyn. The viewer ends up with 112 
minutes worth of sweaty palms, elevated blood pressure and just about 
everything a scary movie should deliver. 
</P>
<P>
A few suggestions: Watch it at night -- the later the better -- with the lights 
out. And, if possible, watch it with someone who doesn't mind having his or her 
arms gripped. 
</P>
<P>
"The Haunting" (1963), directed by Robert Wise. 112 minutes. No rating.

MAX JACOBSON: POLLY'S AND PAPA'S -- AMERICAN AS PEACH PIE AND MOOSE HEADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Polly's Pies and Papa's Pantry (quick, say it fast as you can 10 times) dish up 
solid American comfort foods at bargain prices. No wonder lines spill out the 
door at both places during peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
Polly's has had a substantial following for years, but the new Los Alamitos 
location, No. 7 in Orange County, is attracting the biggest crowds yet. It's a 
bright, sunny spot with the clean, scrubbed look of an upscale candy store. The 
interior is a bright, summery peach color, and if you visit a Polly's in the 
next few weeks, you'll catch their nine-inch fresh peach pies, too. Go early -- 
they're often sold out by late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Before dessert, there are plenty of ways to convince Mom that you're eating a 
balanced meal. Rotisserie chicken is one -- a superbly juicy roast chicken 
cooked on the restaurant's Hardt rotisserie, a high-heat system that causes 
excess fat to drip off judiciously. The BBQ bacon burger is another: lean beef 
on a cracked wheat bun, topped with crackling bacon and a sticky-sweet barbecue 
sauce. It's a sloppy, indulgent burger, and I can't imagine how it could be 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of things are sweet here in the pie palace, even too sweet. The Oriental 
chicken salad is alleged to have sesame oil dressing, but all I could taste was 
sugar. Polly's chili, with ground turkey standing in for the usual ground beef, 
may be what the menu calls "heart smart" but it's tongue foolish. It's 
discordantly sweet, and you'd need scientific instruments to detect any spices. 
</P>
<P>
But, oh, those pies. First there is the flaky house chicken pie, a sumptuous 
offering filled with shredded chicken meat, celery, potato, carrot and fresh 
peas. The crust is rich and buttery, and the pie comes smothered in an 
old-fashioned gravy. And then there are the dessert pies: creams, 
double-crusted specialties and fresh fruit pies. These are unquestionably the 
best pies produced in quantity that I've tasted in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
Now that it's summer, there are lots of fresh fruits -- strawberries, 
raspberries, ollallieberries and peaches -- heaped onto Polly's rich, flaky 
crusts, then bound with a sugar and pectin glaze. The peach is gorgeous with 
its majestic yellow hues, and the heavily glazed strawberry pie comes in two 
varieties, plain or artificially sweetened. (The sweetener used here is Equal, 
making this the lowest in calorie content of any pie they make.) And then there 
is my personal favorite, the raspberry pie, slightly tart, wonderfully light 
and totally refreshing. It's practically perfection. 
</P>
<P>
Polly's is inexpensive. Burgers, sandwiches and hot dishes are $3.15 to $6.25. 
Pies are $2.65 a slice. 
</P>
<P>
Papa's Pantry is a dinner house with a Western twist. Though located in a 
Huntington Beach shopping mall, it manages to look exactly like a steakhouse in 
western Montana. The walls are covered with real moose heads and cowboy hats, 
nooses hang from the dark ceiling like stage lights, tables are draped in 
checked cloths -- brown and white ones, as you'd see in a frontier saloon. It 
all has an oddly mystical effect, as if the present had suddenly vanished and 
become a Rod Serling teleplay. 
</P>
<P>
But the food here, while tasty, is far too ordinary to be served in the 
Twilight Zone. It's mostly Western-style grub with all the fixin's -- nothing 
unusual to be sure, but competently prepared. All dinners come with a choice of 
soup or salad, a choice of potato (ask for the crispy potato pancake) and hot 
garlic bread. These are trencherman potions, so bring a hefty appetite. Or a 
friend who looks like Hoss Cartwright. 
</P>
<P>
Start with a giant bowl of the house soup, either thick vegetable beef or the 
even thicker clam chowder. Salads come with a choice of homemade dressings; the 
Caesar is particularly good, with an egg-rich dressing that completely coats 
the greens. Appetizers such as onion rings and battered zucchini are good here, 
too. The onion rings, big enough to collar a horse, come in a crunchy cornmeal 
breading. Fried zucchini is served in big battered sticks that Teddy Roosevelt 
would approve of. 
</P>
<P>
The inexpensive main dishes -- prime rib, fried chicken and fresh liver, to 
name a few -- are surprisingly good. The prime rib is a tasty bargain at $7.95. 
Liver is grilled to order, with sweet sauteed onions and crisp bacon. Chicken 
(four pieces) comes in a crunchy crust and is virtually greaseless, and, if you 
like, they will charbroil it at no extra cost. Steaks come in all shapes and 
sizes, prepared just the way you want 'em at bronc-busting low prices. I tried 
the chicken fried steak, a big piece of sirloin steak dipped in egg and deep 
fried, and enjoyed every tender bite. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything is perfect here, though. The filet mignon, at $8.95 the most 
expensive item on the menu, was so tough that Lee Van Cleef would have sent the 
thing back. And this is no place for dessert thrills. There are various 
refrigerator cakes that look better than they taste, and a couple of sundaes, 
chocolate and butterscotch. 
</P>
<P>
Papa's Pantry is inexpensive. Sandwiches are $3.50 to $5.95. Complete dinners 
are $5.95 to $8.95.

NEWSBITES: HUBERT'S IN SANTA ANA SERVES UP ECLECTIC INTERNATIONAL MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A major ribbon-cutting is scheduled for Aug. 14 when Hubert's will debut at 2 
Hutton Centre Drive in Santa Ana, where it replaces the Courthouse Restaurant. 
Hubert's will offer an eclectic mix of international cuisine, from Napa cabbage 
tacos of shrimp and sauce choron to lobster strudel with chive butter. The main 
dining room on the first floor will serve lunch Monday through Fridays, Sunday 
brunch, and dinner nightly (a la carte dinner entrees: $12-$16). Downstairs, 
Hubert's bar will offer quick lunches and hot and cold tapas, Spanish finger 
foods from grilled skatewing fish on beds of spinach to chicken and chorizo 
brochette with garlic cumin. The upstairs will contain two banquet facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The guiding light behind the new venture is Hubert Walch, a native of Austria 
who trained there and in Germany. His career in America has included service 
with the Bel-Air Country Club and the Sheraton and Hilton hotel chains. 
Hubert's can be reached at (714) 545-5060. 
</P>
<P>
Let's get oriented: Lotus Court opened last week at 181 E. Commonwealth Ave. in 
Fullerton, serving Hong Kong, Mandarin and Szechwan cuisine. There are more 
than a hundred items on the menu, but judging from the tanks of live lobster 
and crab, the accent is on seafood. Owner Pansy Law has redone the former 
Wonder restaurant in soft mauves with acoustic wall coverings and Oriental 
partitions, and has added a banquet room. (714) 738-3838. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Steaks, meanwhile, has brought Benihana-style teppan yaki fare -- 
lobster, scallops, shrimp, beef filet and lemon-chicken -- to Buena Park. 
There's also a sushi bar and a cocktail bar. It's all at 6890 Beach Blvd., 
where Imagi used to be. (714) 994-2730. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A Kaiseki dinner, a multicourse Japanese dining extravaganza, can set you back 
$50, $75, even $110 in L.A. But at Horikawa in South Coast Plaza Village in 
Santa Ana, you can experience this high end of Japanese cuisine for as little 
as $40. Your server will present small portions, each representing a specific 
way of cooking, one at a time in beautiful containers. Like the tea ceremony, 
the Kaiseki originated as a formal ritual of Zen Buddhism but has become a 
party menu for times of celebration. (714) 557-2531. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New chef in town: Gerard Vie of Les Trois Marches restaurant in Versailles, 
France, and consulting chef at Antoine in Le Meridien in Newport Beach, 
recently introduced Antoine's new chef de cuisine, Roy Breiman. Breiman -- 
would you believe? -- is a native Californian. After completing the curriculum 
at Le Cordon Rouge in Sausalito, he trained with such elite chefs as Vie, Bruno 
Tison in San Francisco and Christian Delouvier in New York, who passed on to 
Breiman what they had learned from such French masters as Roger Verge, Alain 
Chapel and Michel Guerard. Antoine is at 4500 MacArthur Blvd. (714) 476-2001. 
</P>
<P>
Here 'n' There: Le Midi at 3421 Via Lido in Newport Beach celebrated its sixth 
year -- and Switzerland's 699th -- on Aug. 1 with an a la carte dinner of Swiss 
delicacies, Swiss wine and Swiss music. The restaurant recently introduced 
"Summer Night Grazing" with 17 appetizers (two make a light meal) and desserts 
at $5.75 each. (714) 675-4904. . . . Pascal at 1000 Bristol St. in Newport 
Beach has hopped on the good-for-you bandwagon with "cuisine sante," lighter, 
low-cholesterol, low-sodium specialties. (714) 752-0107. . . .

Pringle (R-Garden Grove) said he expected to debate Umberg, but only in forums 
sponsored by independent organizations such as the League of Women Voters. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for Curtis and me to meet face-to-face in a series of 
debates throughout Orange County and the 72nd Assembly District," Umberg said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg suggested that the candidates be free to question each other. Umberg 
campaign manager George Urch said seven debates were proposed, one every two 
weeks until the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said that he debated his Democratic opponent in 1988 about three times 
and that he expected a similar schedule in this race. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, challengers like to grandstand on debates and therefore I expected 
this type of letter," Pringle said. "What he needs to know is that in this 
community they have always had debate formats and he will soon get an 
invitation from some of the established organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never turned down one of those debates and I don't intend to this 
time," he said.

A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy has been charged with assault for 
allegedly chasing down a Costa Mesa man and shooting him after the two men were 
involved in a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Cook, 40, faces a maximum 12-year prison term if he is convicted of the 
charge filed against him Tuesday by the Orange County district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Cook was charged with one count of assault, along with two special allegations 
of using a firearm and inflicting great bodily injury, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Clyde Von Der Ahe. Assault carries a maximum four-year term, but the special 
allegations increase the possible penalty to 12 years, Von Der Ahe said. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, who became a sheriff's deputy in 1977, had been working as a court 
bailiff in a downtown Los Angeles courthouse until recently, but he was 
reassigned to an administration job pending the outcome of the criminal case 
against him, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Katie Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Cook spring from an incident on the evening of April 28, a 
Saturday, when he was off duty and riding a motorcycle in Long Beach. Reginald 
Lamont Payne of Costa Mesa was driving a car on Westminster Avenue near 
Studebaker Road when he hit the back of Cook's motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Payne's lawyer, Gregory Silver, said Cook swung into Payne's lane suddenly and 
Payne swerved to avoid him, but he still clipped Cook's motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Angry, Cook pulled up alongside Payne at a traffic light and shouted a racial 
epithet, then screamed that he was a police officer and that he had a gun but 
displayed no police identification, Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
When Cook reached into his left jacket pocket, Payne became frightened and took 
off, triggering a chase into Seal Beach, Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking that maybe Cook really was a police officer, Payne slowed down and 
pulled into a lighted parking lot at the Rockwell International complex on Seal 
Beach Boulevard, Silver said. When Cook caught up to him, Payne asked how he 
could be sure Cook was an officer, but Cook shoved him against his car and 
screamed at him, Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
Payne broke free and began running, with Cook in pursuit on his motorcycle, 
Silver said. A Rockwell security guard saw Cook chasing Payne on his cycle with 
his revolver drawn and heard him fire five shots, Silver said. As Payne tried 
to climb a fence, Cook fired, hitting Payne in the foot and the leg. 
</P>
<P>
Silver said Cook's conduct violates Sheriff's Department policy, which forbids 
use of a firearm when stopping someone for a misdemeanor charge. He said the 
clash demonstrates that Cook is unsuitable for police work. 
</P>
<P>
"What we had here was a minor traffic incident which unfortunately escalated 
into what could have been a fatal shooting, all as a result of an individual 
who never should have been carrying a gun in the first place," Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
Silver said he plans to file a federal lawsuit against Cook, Los Angeles 
County, the Board of Supervisors and Sheriff Sherman Block, alleging assault 
and battery, negligence and deprivation of Payne's civil rights.

BIZARRE KIDNAP PLOT IS FOILED AS SUSPECT ARRESTED;

<P>
CRIME: UNDERCOVER AGENTS SEIZE A RIVERSIDE MAN ACCUSED OF TARGETING WOMEN FOR 
ABDUCTIONS.

Orange County sheriff's undercover agents arrested a Riverside man Wednesday 
after foiling a bizarre kidnaping plot that targeted as many as half a dozen 
women in Orange, Riverside and Kern counties. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Giles said 38-year-old Daniel A. Lesinski, a former Internal 
Revenue Service employee who once applied to become a deputy sheriff, was being 
held without bail in Orange County Jail on charges of kidnaping and 
solicitation for kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Lesinski was arrested in a Stanton motel without incident after undercover 
agents posing as his accomplices "kidnaped" another agent who was wearing a wig 
and posing as the first victim in the scheme, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
In conversations he had with undercover agents, Lesinski allegedly said he 
planned to film his victims engaged in sexual acts and then use the film to 
persuade the women not to report the abductions to police, threatening to 
release the films to pornography distributors. 
</P>
<P>
Although investigators were unable to establish a link between Lesinski and the 
intended victims, deputies said he told undercover agents that the abductions 
were in retaliation for a business deal that had gone sour and had cost him 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Lesinski, who has no criminal record, worked briefly for the IRS in El Monte in 
1984 and 1985 and at some point applied to become a deputy sheriff in 
Sacramento County, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were first tipped to the plot by female street informants in 
Stanton who said that a man had stopped his car one day and tried to hire them 
to assist in a series of kidnapings. 
</P>
<P>
The informants told the man that they did not want to get involved but knew 
some other women who might help him. They then introduced Lesinski to female 
undercover agents with the Sheriff's Department, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 14 deputies, assisted by a Sheriff's Department helicopter, worked 
on the investigation and surveillance that led to Lesinski's arrest Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
A search of Lesinski's home in Riverside on Wednesday afternoon turned up a 
pistol and police equipment, including a baton, deputies said. In Lesinski's 
car, investigators found several bags of supplies, including duct tape, rope 
and locks. 
</P>
<P>
"He was well prepared," Sgt. Giles said. "He was a meticulous planner." 
</P>
<P>
Investigator Gary W. Jones said that at one point Lesinski had planned to 
kidnap three women and hold them captive in a Stanton motel until their 
husbands came up with the ransom -- at least $30,000 each. One of the targets 
of the plot lives in Huntington Beach and another lives in Fullerton. 
Investigators declined to give their names and said the name and location of 
the third intended victim was not known. 
</P>
<P>
Lesinski allegedly told undercover deputies that the third victim "would be 
worth a lot more money, approximately $3 million." The deputies, who were to 
pose as toy saleswomen or employees of a flower shop, were promised a 5% cut of 
the ransom for helping him abduct the women after their husbands left for work. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside the homes, Lesinski told the undercover agents, they were to steal 
jewelry, credit cards and microwave ovens, authorities said. They were also 
instructed to take automated teller machine cards that would be used later for 
operating cash. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Jones said, Lesinski dropped his plan to kidnap three women and 
decided instead to only "do the Fullerton kidnap, and if that went smooth, he 
had two more to do in Riverside, one in Palm Springs and possibly two more in 
Bakersfield." 
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday, Lesinski and the undercover agents met for a final briefing on 
the planned Fullerton kidnaping, authorities said, and Lesinski gave the 
deputies shirts and hats with large sunglasses and told them to go to the home 
and kidnap the woman. 
</P>
<P>
The agents instead "kidnaped" a male sheriff's deputy posing as the intended 
target. 
</P>
<P>
The plan called for them to take the victim to a Stanton motel, where they 
would meet Lesinski later, authorities said. Sheriff's deputies arrested 
Lesinski at a nearby motel where he had another room.

WIEDER WAR CHEST SWELLS, TOPS NEUGEBAUER'S 20 TO 1; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGNS: THE SUPERVISOR HAS RAISED $319,000 FOR HER RUNOFF WITH THE 
WESTMINSTER COUNCILWOMAN, WHO REPORTS DONATIONS OF $14,542.

Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, the only board incumbent facing a 
runoff election this fall, has raised a whopping $319,000 -- more than 20 times 
the amount raised by her opponent, Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer, 
according to the most recent campaign-finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Don R. Roth, who won reelection by wide margins 
in the June 5 election, each raised about $235,000 in their respective 
campaigns, their reports show. 
</P>
<P>
The reports, which had to be postmarked no later than Tuesday under state law, 
detail campaign spending and fund-raising from May 20 through June 30, and 
include cumulative totals from earlier periods. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer, who has raised only $14,542 in her bid to unseat Wieder in the 2nd 
Supervisorial District, said she that was not discouraged by her relatively 
small war chest. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to plan my campaign to win and I don't intend to have it be a battle 
of who can raise the most dollars," Neugebauer said. "I will be relying on my 
qualifications and not someone else's dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder, who is seeking her fourth term, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer, a veteran councilwoman who served three terms as mayor of 
Westminster, noted that she spent only $8,802 during the most recent filing 
period -- which includes the final days of the June primary race -- but that 
she still won enough votes to force a runoff with Wieder. During the same time 
period, Wieder spent $145,840, according to her disclosure statement. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder garnered 47.1% of the votes cast in June to Neugebauer's 19.9%, while 
three other challengers split the remaining votes. Because no one in the race 
received a clear majority, the two top vote-getters face the runoff in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's disclosure statement shows that her campaign has $35,303 in cash on 
hand and no debts. During the latest filing period, her campaign received 
$86,085 in contributions from a variety of sources, including developers, 
architects, engineers and attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Her largest single campaign contribution for the period was $2,500, from 
Newport Beach-based William Lyon Co., one of the county's largest developers. 
</P>
<P>
Among others who contributed $1,000 to Wieder's campaign are the Building 
Industry Assn. of Southern California, the Los Alamitos Racing Assn., the 
United Auto Workers and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Also listed among Wieder's contributors is Lettuce Amuse U Comedy School Inc., 
which won an exclusive contract earlier this year from the Board of Supervisors 
to run all of the county's traffic-violator schools. The company donated $750 
to Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer reported receiving only $2,410 during the last reporting period. The 
largest cash donation reported was $400 from a dentist; she also reported 
receiving $715 in free printing services. Her campaign has $3,014 in cash on 
hand and no debts, according to the statement.

APPARENT PRANK LEADS TO GUNFIRE

<P>
The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department is investigating allegations of 
a shooting involving an off-duty Huntington Beach police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the incident, which took place Tuesday in the Hathaway Creek area of 
Barton Creek, are sketchy, Sgt. Larry Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown gave this account of the incident: 
</P>
<P>
The officer, whose name was not released at the request of the Huntington Beach 
Police Department, was traveling with a woman on California 38 to Big Bear when 
he spotted what appeared to be someone being stabbed in a group fight. 
</P>
<P>
The officer drove to a turnout about a quarter-mile away and reported the 
incident to the Sheriff's Department. He told investigators he was followed by 
a vehicle parked at the scene. Several people, including a man who was carrying 
what appeared to be a rifle, got out of the vehicle and approached the officer. 
The officer then fired several shots at the man carrying the rifle and possibly 
hit one or two people. The group returned to the vehicle and drove off, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, investigators had determined that the group fight and stabbing 
were apparently a prank staged by local youths to attract the attention of 
passing motorists. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to confirm anything," said Deputy Gus Ulloa. "It's still 
real sketchy to us. It appears to be a fake fight but we still have to verify 
the stories." 
</P>
<P>
The department has not been able to locate anyone involved in the alleged fight 
or any victims of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ed McErlain of the Huntington Beach Police Department confirmed that the 
off-duty officer was involved in the shooting and would be placed on three-day 
administrative leave while the department conducts its own investigation. GREG

SUSPECT WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY ARRESTS

A suspected gang member was grazed by a bullet fired by a Santa Ana police 
officer Wednesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Anaheim youth was wounded about 12:30 p.m. at 5th Street and 
Harbor Boulevard when he tried to elude police, who were searching for suspects 
in connection with a drive-by shooting that left two Garden Grove teen-agers 
with gunshot wounds in the legs. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim youth was treated at the scene for the minor injury and taken into 
custody on suspicion of attempted murder along with four other suspected gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"One suspect began to reach into his waistband and the officer, fearing for his 
life, fired one shot, striking the suspect in the left arm," Santa Ana police 
spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. Police said two other suspects involved in the 
incident were still at large. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were Michael Allen Bower, 19, and a 16-year-old youth, both from 
Garden Grove. Bower was treated and released at the AMI Medical Center of 
Garden Grove; the 16-year-old remained in stable condition at UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were spotted riding in a pickup truck and stopped in the 300 block 
of North Harbor Boulevard by Santa Ana police about 12:35 a.m. Wednesday after 
a description of their vehicle was broadcast. Several people then jumped out of 
the back of the truck, while the driver and a passenger fled in the truck. 
Officers pursued the running suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all part of a rival gang with the people that were shot," Garden 
Grove Police Investigator Mike Hanfield said. 
</P>
<P>
A .38-caliber revolver was found at the scene of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested in connection with the drive-by shooting, which occurred about 11:40 
p.m. Tuesday at a residence in the 12500 block of Sunswept Avenue were two 
adults, Jason Tovar, 21, of Santa Ana and Jerry Felix Cardona, 18, of Garden 
Grove, and three juveniles, one 17-year-old from Anaheim and a 17-year-old and 
a 15-year-old, both of Santa Ana. ROBERT E. PIERRE

2 THEATER WORKERS ROBBED AFTER SHIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two employees at the United Artists theater in the Brea Mall were bound hand 
and foot and robbed of a car and an undetermined amount of money early 
Wednesday morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
As the two male employees prepared to leave the building, two men forced them 
to the floor, tied them up and stole their possessions, along with the money 
from the register and box office, said Brea Police Detective Gran Gulickson. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the robbers apparently had purchased tickets and hid in the theater 
after the end of the movie before robbing the employees about 1 a.m. Among the 
personal possessions taken were a 1968 Mustang belonging to one of the 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Gulickson said one of the victims managed to free himself and call police. No 
injuries were reported.

CONVICTION IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING

<P>
A Santa Ana gang member was convicted of second-degree murder Wednesday for the 
drive-by shooting death of an 18-year-old man in February. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Joseph Salazar, 23, who had been released from prison just six days 
before the shooting, was found guilty of killing Salvador Arias as he fired 
into a crowd of people the night of Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar is a cousin of Robert P. Figueroa, one of the defendants on trial in 
Newport Beach in connection with another fatal drive-by shooting, according to 
Deputy Dist. Atty. James Marion. 
</P>
<P>
Although Salazar was a member of the 5th Street gang, there was no evidence 
that the victim had any gang affiliation, said Marion. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar could receive a maximum of 23 years to life in prison when he is 
sentenced Sept. 14 by Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan, the same judge who 
convicted him after a two-day trial. Ryan also convicted him of using a gun 
during the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 8 p.m. when a red pickup truck slowly drove by a 
home on the 5000 block of West 5th Street. Witnesses said a man positioned in 
the bed of the truck began firing a revolver into a group of about six people 
standing in front of the home and sped away, said Marion. 
</P>
<P>
Arias, a laborer, was fatally shot once in the back of the head and once in the 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, witnesses were reluctant to come forward and identify the shooter, 
said Marion. But during the trial, an 18-year-old Santa Ana man present during 
the incident testified and identified Salazar as the man who fired the gun. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution also presented evidence that indicated Salazar had a friend who 
owned a red pickup truck and had access to it. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar, however, testified in his own defense and denied shooting Arias. He 
claimed he wasn't even present and that he was home watching television during 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant's mother also testified that she was with her son that night but 
admitted she had left the house for a short period. Marion argued that Salazar 
had time to commit the crime. 
</P>
<P>
However, defense attorney Kevin Gallagher argued that Salazar was a victim of 
mistaken identity. He contended that it was too dark for anyone to have been 
able to identify the gunman.

PEOPLE: DISTANCE RUNNER: 49 ONLY A NUMBER

<TEXT>
<P>
At a time when most men are slowing down, Jurgen Ankenbrand, 49, is stepping up 
the pace. 
</P>
<P>
He recently was one of 14 men and two women out of a field of 22 who completed 
the torturous 146-mile Death Valley-to-Mt. Whitney run. 
</P>
<P>
Now he wants to visit Panama for a 50-mile race alongside the canal. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of thing I'm looking for, something different," said the 
Fountain Valley man who started competitive running only three years ago, about 
the same time that he was divorced. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to do something to use up my energy," said Germany-born Ankenbrand, who 
claims he never participated in sports as a youngster. Or for that matter, 
until he was 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always working and never had time for sports," he said in a thick German 
accent. 
</P>
<P>
Before his current job as food services director for El Acanto Convalescent 
Home in the City of Industry, Ankenbrand worked as a chef at some of the 
leading hotels in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tired of working nights and weekends. It didn't leave much time for 
other things," said the one-time food services director at Cal State Long 
Beach, where co-workers urged him to try long-distance running. 
</P>
<P>
Ankenbrand had been playing seven sets of tennis every Sunday for 20 years with 
the same partner (Don Ogden of Orange), "so they thought I was in good enough 
shape to run a marathon." 
</P>
<P>
That was three years ago and without much training, Ankenbrand has run in 16 
marathons in an average time of 4 hours and 10 minutes, finishing them all. 
</P>
<P>
But he has cut his tennis playing to only five sets each Sunday, noting that 
"tennis is now my second sport." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other marathoners, who run upwards of 100 miles a week, "I don't like 
regimented workouts. Maybe I'm lazy," he said, noting that he runs only 20 
miles a week, in training or not. 
</P>
<P>
However, at this point in his life, Ankenbrand is getting bored with marathons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no longer a challenge," he said, pointing out that 90% of all marathon 
runners finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I need something more challenging," said Ankenbrand, who has run the Los 
Angeles and Long Beach marathons and two 50-mile races this year. 
</P>
<P>
That was the reason for the 146-mile Death Valley run last month. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my most challenging race and there were times when I wanted to stop," 
he admits. "The heat was up to 115 degrees and I had so many blisters on my 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other runners in the international field of competitors dropped 
out. Most of the other athletes were in their 30s. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hurting and my body was telling me to quit, but I had the determination 
and will power you get from maturity," he said. "I just kept going." 
</P>
<P>
It's that philosophy that keeps Ankenbrand running. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a positive attitude," he said. "It has never occurred to me 
that I would not finish a race." 
</P>
<P>
And now, Ankenbrand said, all his races will be 50 miles or longer and he feels 
his age is not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 49, but I think of myself as younger than that," he said. "The number 49 
doesn't mean anything to me. It's just a number." 
</P>
<P>
And just to prove it, he plans to compete in a triathlon in August, the 
100-mile Angeles Crest Trail Run in September and the San Juan 50-Mile Trail 
Run in November. 
</P>
<P>
Ankenbrand has also learned that rewards are not substantial for long-distance 
running. 
</P>
<P>
He received a T-shirt for finishing the 146-mile Death Valley-Mt. Whitney Run. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Suzanne Schultz, who teaches special education students at 
Springbrook Elementary School in Irvine, was named Teacher of the Year by the 
school and later received a letter from Barbara Bush, lauding her for the 
honor. "Thank you for caring," wrote the First Lady.

SUSPECT SHOT BY OFFICER IN DRUG DEAL

<P>
An Irvine police officer on Wednesday shot and wounded a man who allegedly sold 
half a kilogram of cocaine to undercover narcotics officers and then fled when 
they tried to arrest him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name was not immediately available, was taken to Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana with a bullet wound in the back of his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
Another man involved in the apparent drug deal with undercover agents was 
arrested on suspicion of selling cocaine, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine police said the arrests were the result of an extensive investigation 
that led undercover officers to Santa Ana. The officers had negotiated drug 
buys with the suspects on several occasions before Wednesday's incident, which 
occurred about 6:20 p.m. near Edinger Avenue and the Costa Mesa Freeway, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After completing the alleged drug deal, the suspects fled when the undercover 
officers identified themselves and tried to arrest them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
One suspect was apprehended quickly, but the other struck an officer with his 
fist and ran down an alley in an industrial area near Edinger Avenue and 
Ritchey Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer chased the suspect and "at one point during the pursuit, the 
suspect turned (toward the officer), causing the officer to fear for his safety 
and the safety of others," Irvine Police Lt. Pat Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer fired two shots at the suspect but missed, police at the scene 
said. The suspect continued running and crossed Edinger Avenue to a dirt lot. 
The officer followed and apparently fired two more rounds at the suspect, 
hitting him in the leg, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the Orange County district attorney's office are 
investigating the incident as they do all officer-involved shootings. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the 14th officer-involved shooting in Orange County this year.

LANGSTON A WINNER AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: LEFT-HANDER ENDS HIS EIGHT-GAME LOSING STREAK BY HOLDING OFF THE TWINS 
IN AN 11-5 VICTORY AT METRODOME. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Never did Mark Langston give in to despair. 
</P>
<P>
There were, during his eight-game losing streak, days that he wondered when the 
light might break the cloud of futility that enveloped him. Langston's 
religious faith lifted those doubts and his faith in his pitching ability 
carried him past some rough spots Wednesday, when he earned his first victory 
since June 5 in the Angels' 11-5 victory over the Minnesota Twins at the 
Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
"Three starts ago, the game at home, was about as rock bottom as I got," 
Langston said, referring to a 2 2/3-inning outing against Cleveland on July 22 
in which he allowed six runs. "I'd been pitching good enough to lose, and then 
I had the blowout game at home and I was very clue-less. I was on my knees 
(praying) quite a bit that whole night trying to figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
"What answers did I come to? Just don't give in. Never give in. Each game 
you've got a chance to do it. You can go one direction or the other -- give in 
or battle and come out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Langston (5-13) battled himself as much as he battled the Twins, slipping back 
into his dangerous habit of trying to make the perfect pitch instead of the 
most expedient. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-run lead presented him by his teammates in the third inning gave him 
some leeway. It was three more runs than they scored in his last four starts 
combined. He used almost all of it, needing help from Willie Fraser and Bryan 
Harvey to preserve the victory that put the Angels back in fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
With victories in three of their past four games, the Angels finished a 4-6 
trip with renewed self-respect. For no one was that more true than Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very flustrating, the whole ordeal," he said, "but I got a win, and 
I think I needed to win a game whether it was 1-0 or today's game. I'll 
definitely appreciate wins more than I ever have in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Langston got over the hump in the fifth when he escaped trouble by showing a 
resolve he admittedly has lacked. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels finished off Minnesota starter Roy Smith (5-9) by scoring three 
times in the second and four more in the third. The highlight was Bill 
Schroeder's two-run double in the second and Schroeder's fourth home run of the 
season in the third. But the Twins, with Langston throwing them mostly 
fastballs, scored a run in the fourth and added three in the fifth on two 
singles, a triple by Nelson Liriano and a double by Kirby Puckett to cut the 
Angels' lead to 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett stood on second with none out and the fourth, fifth and sixth hitters 
coming up, creating a moment of truth for Langston. He knew the game could be 
determined by his next few pitches, and his determination to win prevailed. 
Langston got Gene Larkin to fly to left, Brian Harper to right and Kent Hrbek 
to center. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost played right into their hands," he said. "Instead of changing speeds 
and doing the things I'd been doing, I kept throwing harder and harder and they 
kept hitting it. With a big lead like that, the last thing I wanted to do was 
let them creep back into the game. I was lucky, basically, that I got out of 
the inning. It could have been even worse than it was." 
</P>
<P>
It could have been worse in the eighth, after the Twins cut the Angels' lead to 
8-5 and had runners on first and third with one out. Harvey came in and walked 
pinch-hitter Randy Bush, but Al Newman hit the first pitch for an inning-ending 
double play. 
</P>
<P>
Langston's earned-run average climbed to 4.28. And in his last three games he 
has given up 16 earned runs in 11 1/3 innings, an ERA of 12.71. That mattered 
less to him and his teammates than the knowledge that he finally succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a start, particularly since he had to sweat it out in the eighth," Brian 
Downing said. "He was a hit away from a no-decision. It's like a hitter in a 
slump who gets one bloop hit that turns it around -- maybe that'll work for 
him, too. 
</P>
<P>
"He struggled, but we got him a lot of runs and got him a win for a change. 
Maybe this is a good omen for him. It's a big negative off his back." 
</P>
<P>
Langston is positive he can again learn to enjoy winning. "It's been awhile, a 
real long while. I forgot the feeling, to tell you the truth," he said. "It's a 
real good feeling, even as bad as it was. . . . It was ugly, but I've got a 
smile on my face." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader said the club salvaged what could have been a 
disastrous trip by winning two of three games in Minnesota. "There were great 
hopes for this trip because it was very important, as is the home stand," he 
said. "The way it started out (losing three of four in Oakland and two of three 
in Seattle) we did fine, because let's face it, those first two stops weren't 
too good." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Harper's fourth-inning double for Minnesota stretched his hitting streak 
to 22 games, the longest in the American League this season. St. Louis' Willie 
McGee also has a 22-game streak. The longest streak in the majors this season 
was 23 games by the Phillies' Lenny Dykstra. 
</P>
<P>
In scoring 11 runs Wednesday and 13 on Tuesday, the Angels hit double figures 
in runs in back-to-back games for the first time since May 21 and 24 of 1989. . 
. . The Angels hit .296 on this trip (106 for 358) and scored 51 runs, but 
their pitchers gave up 49 earned runs in 86 1/3 innings, for an earned-run 
average of 5.11. 
</P>
<P>
Rader said he wasn't bothered by two runners being caught in rundowns and 
another thrown out stealing. "It's important for us to show more outward 
physical exuberance and be willing to take more chances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Polonia's second-inning single ended his 0-for-13 drought and improved his 
mood. "If I go 0-for one game I go crazy," said Polonia, whose two-for-five day 
raised his average to .302. "And look who it's against: guys like (Monday's 
starter Kevin) Tapani or however you say it. There ain't no Cy Youngs there. 
It's OK if you're talking (Mark) Gubicza, (Bret) Saberhagen and (Roger) 
Clemens." . . . Outfielder Max Venable is hampered by corns on his feet and has 
not started the past four games.

EAST COAST CHAIN GIVES O.C. FIRM A HEALTHY BOOST

<P>
In a big boost to a little south Orange County company, the nation's largest 
drug store chain has decided to carry CigArrest stop-smoking products at its 
2,400 stores. 
</P>
<P>
Advantage Life Products Inc. of Laguna Hills said Wednesday that Rite-Aid Drug 
Stores, an East Coast-based chain, has begun carrying its CigArrest gum and 
other stop-smoking products at its stores. 
</P>
<P>
Advantage Life markets CigArrest primarily as a chewing gum to help smokers 
quit their habit. 
</P>
<P>
Advantage Life President Charles Sleichter said that Rite-Aid plans to put one 
of the company's displays in each of its stores. The company also sells its 
products through some major department store chains and at airport gift 
counters. 
</P>
<P>
"The selection by Rite-Aid illustrates the continued emergence of the smoking 
cessation products market and CigArrests' leadership position in that market," 
Sleichter said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is the latest indication that Advantage Life continues to cash in on 
the anti-smoking wave.

NEC REPORTS QUARTERLY LOSS OF $6.4 MILLION 
</P>

<P>
National Educational Corp., a provider of educational and vocational services, 
on Wednesday reported a second-quarter loss of $6.4 million, compared to a loss 
of $1.5 million for the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
NEC said the losses were expected and resulted from continuing problems at its 
Applied Learning subsidiary. It added, however, that it is "pleased with the 
progress" in resolving the subsidiary's problems. 
</P>
<P>
NEC paid a $5.3-million arbitration award to former President H. David Bright 
in the second quarter. The payment was offset, however, by an insurance payment 
of $5.5-million arising from the settlement last year of a class-action lawsuit 
brought by stockholders. The net result of the two transactions was a reduction 
in losses of about $100,000 for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding those one-time events, the company was able to generate enough of a 
positive cash flow during the quarter that its lenders released it from a 
requirement to raise $10 million in working capital in return for its 
commitment to reduce bank debt by $5 million. Vice President Jeff Brill said 
the positive cash flow should allow the company to reduce its debt to $57 
million, from $62 million. 
</P>
<P>
The loss for the quarter ending June 30 came on revenue of $88 million, down 
8.3% from $96.6 million in the corresponding period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of 1990, NEC lost $14.8 million on revenue of $173.4 
million, compared to a loss of $5.5 million on revenue of $196.1 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
NEC stock closed Wednesday at $4.75, down 62.5 cents, in trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
In March, NEC announced the settlement of the class-action lawsuit brought by a 
group of stockholders who alleged that the Irvine-based company misled them 
about its financial condition by withholding crucial financial information. The 
company had maintained that the lawsuit was without merit. 
</P>
<P>
With those problems behind it, some analysts are predicting that NEC will 
return to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are in transition and that operations will improve," said Arthur 
Rade, an analyst for Merrill Lynch Research in New York. He said he expects the 
company to post modest profits for the third quarter ending Sept. 30 and 
stronger profits after that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the early phase of recovery and the changes that they have made 
are critical to long-term improvement," Rade added. 
</P>
<P>
But Seth Feinstein, vice president and senior analyst for the Newhard Cook 
division of Advest, a Los Angeles brokerage, said the vocational-training 
industry is slumping because of the nation's low unemployment rates. 
</P>
<P>
When jobs are relatively easy to find, fewer workers seek vocational training, 
he said. He added that the federal government has imposed tougher requirements 
on student loans as part of its effort to crack down on fraud in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that National Education is having problems that are particular to it. 
The industry stinks. If you look around, all the vocational schools are having 
disappointing results," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
NEC Vice President Brill disagreed, saying that vocational education is "not a 
growth area right now," but that revenue has remained fairly steady. 
</P>
<P>
NATIONAL EDUCATION CORP. PERFORMANCE 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter ended June 30, National Education Corp. reported a loss 
of $6.4 million. It attributed the loss to continuing problems in its Applied 
Learning subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Figures are in thousands except per share data.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vintage and antique bicycles will be shown at the 13th annual Whiz-In at the 
Elks Lodge in Fountain Valley on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The event will feature a ride of vintage motorbikes Saturday and a show and 
swap meet Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The show will include antique and nostalgic bicycles and all types of motorized 
bikes. Whizzers are a motorized version of Schwinn bicycles made in 1939-52, 
according to event organizer Sterling Pope. An engine kit or Whizzer could be 
bolted on to any bike of that era.

<P>
Last year, the event attracted 65 vendors of vintage bicycles and parts. 
Admission is $2. 
</P>
<P>
The event will be held from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at the Elks 
Lodge, 10480 Talbert Ave., at the San Diego Freeway in Fountain Valley. For

HOW TO GET AROUND ORANGE COUNTY WITHOUT USING A CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELENA BRUNET 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The thought of getting around Orange County in any manner other than private 
automobile is rarely considered by residents if they can avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
But there are alternatives. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* Amtrak makes stops at Fullerton, Anaheim, Santa Ana, Irvine, San Juan 
Capistrano and San Clemente. In Irvine, the trains make three northbound 
departures and another three departures southbound during weekdays; on 
weekends, there are only two departures in either direction. There is only one 
daily northbound departure from San Clemente, and two daily southbound stops. 
</P>
<P>
For information about fares or the train schedule, call (800) USA-RAIL. 
</P>
<P>
* Buses in Orange County are a surprise to many. Bus schedules are available to 
passengers and more often than not the buses arrive on time. Bus-stop signs are 
spaced every two or three blocks along the routes. The bus will stop if a 
person signals that he or she is awaiting a ride. Exact fare or a bus pass is 
required: Drivers do not carry change. 
</P>
<P>
Regular fare at all times is 90 cents. It is 45 cents for seniors and the 
handicapped during weekday peak hours (6 to 9 a.m., 3 to 6 p.m.) and 15 cents 
at all other times. The blind may ride for free. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Transit District telephone operators provide bus times and will 
also send free bus schedules. They field calls at (714) 636-RIDE from 6 a.m. to 
7 p.m. weekdays; 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekends. From south Orange County (cities 
south of Irvine) call (714) 496-4623. And TDD service for the hearing-impaired 
is available at (714) 636-HEAR or 636-4327. The information center is closed on 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
For the handicapped, the blind and the wheelchair-bound, dial-a-ride service 
has been the answer, particularly for patients traveling to or from a hospital 
or doctor. However, trip distances on dial-a-ride vans are limited within the 
boundaries of small zones, each covering a few square miles. 
</P>
<P>
Fares are 90 cents for senior citizens and the disabled per zone and $1.80 per 
zone for all others. A dial-a-ride transfer to another zone doubles the cost of 
the trip. For bus or dial-a-ride information, phone (714) 636-7433. 
</P>
<P>
* For people without a car and the desire to use public transportation, another 
answer is the car/van pool. Assistance is provided by the Transit District's 
commuter network. Information regarding schedules and home/job areas is entered 
into a computer, which then matches the starting points, destinations and work 
schedules and provides individual names and contact phone numbers. After that 
it's up to the principals to arrange the pool, including financial 
arrangements. The Transit District follows up to see if pools are working. If 
not, the computer will be asked to expand the so-called "home grid" to see if 
there are other possible matches. For information, call (714) 636-7433. 
</P>
<P>
* Laguna Beach Municipal Transit offers a trolley service within city limits. 
This service costs 50 cents and can take a passenger anywhere within the buses' 
complete circle tour of Laguna Beach. During the Festival of the Arts, the cost 
is 75 cents one way, or $2.50 for a full-day pass. For information, phone (714) 
497-3311. 
</P>
<P>
* If public transportation is inconvenient, or if you require immediate travel, 
a taxi may be the next best thing to driving your own car, if cost is not a 
hardship. Taxicabs are generally available within 15 minutes. The taxi's meter 
starts at $1.90 and 20 cents is charged for each one-seventh of a mile, 
amounting to $3.30 for the first mile; $1.60 for each mile thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Yellow Cab service for Costa Mesa, Tustin, El Toro, Westminster, Fountain 
Valley, Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Mission Viejo, Laguna Niguel, Laguna 
Hills and Irvine is available by calling (714) 546-4942 or (714) 546-1311. 
Yellow Cab service is available within specific cities; for additional numbers, 
check local telephone listings.

TEENS BUILD CONFIDENCE AT SEMINAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Focus is exactly what Mike McCaffrey hopes he has brought to the lives of 
teen-agers who have attended his seminars over the past 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
The FOCUS program has been presented to hundreds of business people over the 
years, but McCaffrey's summer conference is aimed at youths 16 to 19 years old. 
</P>
<P>
He teaches effective communication, the necessity of a good self-image, 
affirmation of goals and development of self-esteem. Last weekend's conference 
was at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Through a process of thinking, writing and analyzing, participants discover 
ways to set goals as well methods to reach them. 
</P>
<P>
"You would, perhaps, be amazed by your own initiative," said McCaffrey, 
referring to goal-setting and goal-getting. 
</P>
<P>
Although FOCUS involves a lot of work, teen-agers seem to find the four-day 
seminar fun. The personal atmosphere makes the project more enjoyable -- only 
25 are allowed in each group. 
</P>
<P>
Colin Anderson, 19 and a sophomore at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, says the 
conference was much more than he had expected. Anderson's mother took part in 
the program through her work and encouraged him to attend. "I've really learned 
a lot," Anderson said. "He (McCaffrey) taught me about goal-setting and 
communicating. It's not just talking. You've got to be a good listener too." 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Ellis, 17, attends a boarding school in Arizona and has made two trips 
to attend McCaffrey's seminar. "I've changed so much since last year," she 
said. "Because you learn so much here about trust, responsibility, 
communication . . . everything." 
</P>
<P>

Students spend nearly 10 months each year waiting for those precious and few 
days of summer. But even the most idyllic existence can be ruined by something 
as trivial as a peeling tan or parents nagging you to get a job. 
</P>
<P>
Although there may be no cure, Hot Topics wonders: "What gives you the 
summertime blues?" 
</P>

L.B. COUNCIL REFUSES TO PUT ETHICS PACKAGE ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week rejected a ballot proposal to create a local ethics 
commission to investigate allegations of improprieties against elected 
officials and other city employees. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would also have established public funding for political campaigns 
and given the five-member ethics panel the power to raise the pay of local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
In a heated meeting Tuesday that was marked by confusion and sideline 
negotiations, the council voted against sending the proposal to the voters in 
November. Council members, meeting as the Charter Amendment Committee, voted 7 
to 2 to refer the ethics package to the council's Legislative Committee for 
further work. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, that killed it," said Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, who 
supported the proposal. "The deadline to get it on the November ballot is Aug. 
10." 
</P>
<P>
Braude said after the council meeting: "Obviously, I'm disappointed. When will 
we deal with the concerns of our citizens about campaign reform?" 
</P>
<P>
Activist Bob Roxby chided the council, urging members to "stop acting like a 
bunch of politicians trying to keep your jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Roxby said residents are "mad enough" to approve a ballot initiative on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Les Robbins echoed the concerns of opponents when he said, 
"We're sitting here with a proposal that no one knows how much it will cost." 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimated that the proposal would cost the city about $500,000 
annually. But Robbins and others predicted that outside attorneys would have to 
be hired -- at $150 an hour -- raising the costs significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Warren Harwood said: "A tax-poor community that can't afford to put 
cops on the street can't afford this. We're not anti-ethics. We're practical 
people who have to deal with the problems of this city." 
</P>
<P>
Harwood also described the proposal as a back-door attempt to give the council 
a pay raise. Last June, voters rejected a proposal to double salaries for the 
part-time council to about $35,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also questioned whether the measure's public-financing provision 
could withstand a court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day that the council debated the issue, Los Angeles City Councilman 
Ernani Bernardi and others sued to block implementation of the finance 
provisions of a recently adopted ethics package in Los Angeles. They argued 
that public financing of campaigns is prohibited under 1988's Proposition 73 
campaign measure. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach measure rejected Tuesday was partly modeled after Proposition H, 
the ethics package that Los Angeles voters approved in June. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach ethics package would have created an ethics committee with 
subpoena powers and the authority to enforce conflict-of-interest and campaign 
regulations. It would also have limited individual contributions to $750 per 
candidate during each election and allowed for public campaign funding, 
although it did not specify amounts. 
</P>
<P>
The measure's fate seemed unsure throughout most of the meeting, where it 
became apparent that council members Braude, Wallace Edgerton, Tom Clark and 
Clarence Smith supported it, while council members Harwood, Robbins, Doug 
Drummond and Jeff Kellogg opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ray Grabinski held the key swing vote. During a series of straw 
polls, which are rare during council meetings, Grabinski indicated that he 
supported the measure. But as the meeting continued and it became clear that 
his vote was not firm, council members continually left their seats to argue 
among themselves, sometimes angrily. 
</P>
<P>
After one five-minute recess, Braude suggested delaying action for a week to 
discuss the measure with the city's unions, because the proposal would affect 
all employees. 
</P>
<P>
Edgerton objected, saying: "I will not be here on Monday. . . . We're playing 
games. Everybody knows where they're coming from." 
</P>
<P>
Grabinski, telling why he finally decided to oppose the measure, told his 
colleagues: "I didn't think it was a great idea for us to snap because Los 
Angeles has or presumes it has (an ethics) problem." 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mayor Ernie Kell also suggested that his veto power be 
strengthened as part of the ethics package. Several council members said that 
Kell had been lobbying for stronger veto power. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody had an agenda," Robbins said Wednesday. "Evan wanted his ethics 
commission. Tom wanted his public financing. Wally wanted a pay raise, and 
Ernie wanted a veto."

WANTED: POSITIVE IMAGE FOR A VALLEY WITHOUT ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two years and more than $40,000 ago, a coalition of San Gabriel Valley cities 
started desperately seeking an image. 
</P>
<P>
The search is still on, but the region's would-be spin doctors crept a bit 
closer to their goal Tuesday, with the issuance of a final report by the San 
Gabriel Valley Image Project Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, formed of city officials nine months ago, grew out of a 
consultants study commissioned in 1988 that recommended an all-out effort to 
promote the area as a desirable place to live, work and invest. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's report paves the way for a new nonprofit organization to come up with 
an image-making strategy. The organization is expected to be incorporated this 
week, and will be headed by a 10-member board of directors, including city 
officials, developers and investors, said Richard Zimmer, president of the 
Synthesis Group, the task force's consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer said the organization's initial budget is $141,500, including funding 
for a management firm, brochures, pamphlets, videos and a business development 
center. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, participating cities are expected to pay $78,000 for 
the first year of operation, and the business sector's share is estimated at 
$63,500. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra, Baldwin Park, Duarte, Irwindale, Monrovia, San Marino, South Pasadena 
and West Covina are expected to take part. 
</P>
<P>
There have, however, been a few dropouts since the original survey was 
commissioned in 1988. Azusa is one. 
</P>
<P>
"The project does have merit," Azusa City Administrator Fred Diaz said. "But at 
this point in time, the council is interested in social programs for youths."

CITY OFFICIALS SUPPORT POLICE MUSEUM PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHLAND PARK: BACKERS CAN BEGIN RAISING $6 MILLION TO MODIFY A HISTORIC 
STATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles officials have endorsed a plan to transform the city's historic 
Northeast Police Station in Highland Park into a museum that will house Los 
Angeles Police Department mementos and law enforcement exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsement allows museum backers to begin raising the more than $6 million 
they need to open the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Capping more than a year of debate on the future of the 65-year-old building, 
the Los Angeles City Council last week unanimously directed the city attorney 
to prepare an agreement leasing the station to the Los Angeles Police 
Historical Society for 30 years at $1 per year. The station, at 6045 York 
Blvd., has not been used by the Los Angeles Police Department since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Boasting a distinctive Renaissance Revival architecture, the station is a city 
and federal landmark that has often been used as a backdrop by Hollywood 
filmmakers. Last year, a group of police officers proposed turning it into a 
police museum. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, city officials have considered incorporating the police 
museum project into one of two rival proposals calling for construction of 
housing, offices and a restaurant in and around the historic station. City 
Councilman Richard Alatorre had said merging the museum with a commercial 
project would have provided private funding to renovate the building. 
</P>
<P>
But last week's decision will allow the museum to proceed without ties to a 
commercial project. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the only right thing you could use that building for," said Officer 
Richard Ledesma, a member of the historical society's board of directors who 
works at the Police Department's Northeast station on San Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
Museum boosters, who earlier said the project would cost about $4.5 million, 
now have raised their cost estimates to $6 million for renovation, construction 
of exhibits and staffing. 
</P>
<P>
A fund-raising consultant for the society has also recommended that an 
additional $1.5 million be raised as an endowment to offset some of the 
museum's operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
Ledesma said the historical society board is also considering construction of a 
youth recreation center on the grounds, which could cost another $1.5 million 
to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
In his motion endorsing the museum lease, Alatorre stipulated that the 
organizers must provide a progress report in two years regarding their 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Richard Kalk, president of the society and the museum's most vocal 
supporter, said the group has raised little money thus far because it has not 
had possession of the station. Now that the society has been given permission 
to use the building, he said, it will be easier to solicit donations. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has fallen into place," Kalk said. "The tentative response we're 
getting regarding donations is so positive. We're not going to have any trouble 
showing the city we can build the museum." 
</P>
<P>
He said the society would seek funding from major corporate foundations and 
then launch a public donation drive. 
</P>
<P>
The historical society has hired a professional fund-raising consultant, Culver 
City-based Netzel/Steinhaus and Associates. Jeff Conway, the firm's vice 
president, said the group will spend months preparing a more detailed budget 
and fund-raising strategy before launching a donation drive in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers believe the museum could open in about five years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced it is a very popular project," Conway said. "We're confident 
of its success." 
</P>
<P>
He said a key first step will be to expand the society's board from nine to 19 
to include members who have more expertise in construction and fund-raising and 
to make it representative of the community's ethnic and cultural diversity. 
Current board members are all active or retired police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The museum received a boost in April when Los Angeles voters approved a bond 
measure, sponsored by Alatorre, to pay for earthquake-safety repairs in 
city-owned structures. It included $1.2 million for the station. 
</P>
<P>
Before the measure was approved, friction developed between Kalk and Alatorre 
because of the councilman's concern that the museum's backers had insufficient 
funds to build the project without working with a commercial developer. 
</P>
<P>
But Robin Cramer, Alatorre's chief of staff, said a spirit of cooperation now 
prevails. She said the councilman's staff plans to shepherd the museum through 
the complex city planning approval process. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is work as a team from the get-go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tentatively, the museum will display police guns and vehicles, a tribute to 
slain and injured officers, exhibits on famous arrests and unsolved cases and a 
comparison of actual law enforcement versus its depiction on television. 
</P>
<P>
Al Fiori, whose Venice firm is the museum's design consultant, said the 
exhibits will have a strong educational component, showing youngsters the 
consequences of drug dealing and drunk driving. They will also focus on such 
crime-solving techniques as fingerprints, autopsies and fiber analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Fiori said the museum will have many high-tech interactive exhibits such as a 
police car simulator that would allow visitors to experience participating in a 
street patrol and a device for creating a composite sketch of a crime suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just going to be a static collection of police chiefs' pictures and 
badges," he said. "It's going to be a hands-on museum. This is a showcase for 
the state-of-the-art in police science."

IMAGE-CONSCIOUS INDUSTRY TOWN UNVEILS SECOND PUBLIC ARTWORK 
</P>

SANTA FE SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, this city had more hazardous waste sites than public artworks. 
There was not a piece of art to be seen in the industrial city -- unless you 
appreciate the stark outlines of oil derricks and massive storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are two sculptures -- and counting. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, city officials dedicated "Undone Abstraction" by Claremont artist 
James Mitchell in a half-acre triangle of city park on Pioneer Boulevard east 
of Alburtis Avenue. The steel-slab sculpture, six feet high on a two-foot base, 
is the latest product of a year-old ordinance. It requires builders to donate 
an amount equal to 1% of their project cost toward public art for developments 
of at least $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The city's first piece of public artwork, Utah artist Dennis Smith's sculpture 
of a little girl reading, was dedicated about a month ago in front of the city 
library in the town center. 
</P>
<P>
The public art ordinance symbolizes an ambitious exercise in image-changing for 
this town with only 15,000 residents, but more than 3,000 businesses, including 
two oil refineries and a pair of hazardous waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the city opened Heritage Park, a $4-million project. The 
6.5-acre park contains the ruins of a 19th Century estate as well as its 
restored Victorian gardens, which in the 1880s put Santa Fe Springs on the map, 
city officials say. Also restored are a carriage barn, an English-style 
greenhouse and a windmill irrigation system. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last year, the city also has opened to the public the Clarke estate, 
a long-forgotten 8,000-square-foot, turn-of-the-century mansion that the city 
bought and restored for $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The mansion's original owners departed in the 1920s about the same time as the 
city's ranching image, when geologists discovered what was then the 
sixth-largest known reserve of oil in the world, said Margaret Hammon, the 
city's cultural-resource specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The oil boom turned Santa Fe Springs into a dirty, sprawling, bustling, 
unincorporated company town surrounded by vast open spaces, where orange groves 
shared fields with oil rigs. But as the crude reserves dwindled, the 
nine-square-mile city, incorporated in 1957, has found itself with plenty of 
real estate to offer. 
</P>
<P>
"The welcome mat is out," City Manager Don Powell said of the city's well-known 
pro-business stance, which has attracted $60 million in developments annually 
for the last five years. Most of the city is zoned for heavy industry, and the 
city typically puts approval of industrial projects on the fast track. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no artist behind it, the landscape of heavy industry owns a 
beauty of its own, said Hammon, who has master's degrees in fine arts and 
public administration. On Carmenita Road below Imperial Highway, there remains 
a refinery on the east and dozens of huge storage tanks on the west side of the 
street. "At night, you should drive down that street," she said. "It's just 
beautiful. It's an interesting, glorious sight to see all those tanks lit." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, city officials and staff decided that local residents should 
benefit more directly from this commercial vitality. Hammon said the city's 
landscaped median strips and railway overpasses have long been a source of 
local pride. But City Manager Powell decided those enhancements were not enough 
and circulated the public art ordinance idea, which he said is modeled after 
similar regulations in Brea, Norwalk and Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
The program in Brea, another former oil town, has resulted in the creation of 
91 works of art since 1975. The rate now is about six a year. 
</P>
<P>
The works in Santa Fe Springs must reflect one or more of three historical 
periods: Mexican/Indian, turn-of-the-century ranching or industrial modern. 
</P>
<P>
Although only two pieces of art have been created so far, the Santa Fe Springs 
project has outproduced, by two, a similar program in Los Angeles. There, the 
City Council approved its own version of the ordinance in November, 1988, but a 
concern over possible lawsuits from developers has delayed its start, said Jane 
Kolb, a spokesperson for the city's Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
No such legal challenge was forthcoming from Jeffery Potter, the 36-year-old 
president of Potter Development Corp. Potter paid for the latest sculpture so 
he could build his just-completed, office-warehouse structure. 
</P>
<P>
Potter collects contemporary California art for his home and office. "It's like 
a little museum," he said of his Los Angeles corporate headquarters. "I never 
have enough art." 
</P>
<P>
For a city with about 175,000 fewer pieces of artwork than the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art, the match was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Potter could have placed the sculpture in front of his building, but agreed to 
the more accessible Pioneer Boulevard site, which is flanked by businesses on 
one side and a neighborhood of modest, boxy houses on the other. Potter, whose 
brief, prepared remarks at the ceremony Tuesday were partly drowned out by a 
parking 18-wheeler, said he hoped the traffic from both communities would enjoy 
the red and black painted sculpture. The developer, who said he long wanted to 
be an artist himself, contributed about $10,000 more to the artwork's creation 
than the $14,000 the city required. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Mitchell's work consists of two rectangular boxes balanced at about 
45-degree angles and connected by a circular joint. The 33-year-old Claremont 
artist, who has sold sculptures across the country, said in a later interview 
that his work represents an exercise in volume and space rather than message, 
but Mitchell noted a persistent theme in the labors of city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think of Santa Fe Springs, it's always oil derricks, industrial 
factories and railroad yards," he said. "They are trying to improve their 
image. The art program is one step in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
By 11:45 a.m. Tuesday, the dignitaries had departed, but their efforts clearly 
had the desired effect on local resident Rod Duarte, who attended the 
dedication. 
</P>
<P>
The retired 74-year-old has lived in Santa Fe Springs for 38 years and 
remembers both the open fields and the heavy industry. "I've been all over the 
world," said the Air Force veteran, "and I wouldn't move out of here for 
anything. It is the best city to live in."

FULFILLING A FARAWAY PROMISE;

8 MEN WHO FORGED A PACT IN ARMENIA START THEIR DREAM MAGAZINE

<TEXT>
<P>
Seventeen years ago, at the Polytechnic Institute of Yerevan, eight young 
Armenian students who hailed from all corners of Europe and the Middle East 
shared a dorm and a dream: 
</P>
<P>
They told each other that someday, after they all became successful in 
business, they would start a publishing venture together -- a news magazine 
like Time and Newsweek to report on events about Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
Now, their fantasy has become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
From a small office in Glendale, the eight young men have put out an inaugural 
56-page issue of Armenian International Magazine. Thirty thousand copies are 
being distributed to Armenian communities from Yerevan to Sydney, with the 
largest number going to shops and newsstands in the dozens of Southern 
California neighborhoods that are home to 250,000 Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine is a careful blending of American news magazine style with muted 
symbols of Armenian pride, rage and yearning for independence from the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
A reflective silver cover highlights the number "75," signifying this year's 
anniversary of the Armenians' expulsion from Turkey. The magazine's content is 
everything Armenian, from upbeat reports on the Armenian jewelry trade and 
architecture to sobering pieces on the homeland's economy and border strife, 
spiced with profiles of California Supreme Court Justice Armand Arabian and 
University of Nevada Las Vegas basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian. Full-page 
color ads push Russian vodka along with Armenian brandy and Royal Jordanian 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
One thing above all tells what Armenian International Magazine is about. From 
cover to cover, every word is in English. 
</P>
<P>
English, the publishers believe, is the language that will appeal to the most 
influential and prosperous in their community and at the same time establish a 
credible Armenian voice for the non-Armenian reader. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, we would like to be the source for Time and Newsweek and the Los 
Angeles Times to pick up," said Managing Editor Vartan Oskanian. "We would like 
to see the American media coming to us for correct information." 
</P>
<P>
It is no coincidence, in fact, that AIM has appeared at a time when an 
unprecedented flow of international news has come from Armenia, much of it 
confusing and politically charged. 
</P>
<P>
Even as reports of the devastating earthquake of December, 1988, were fading, 
the eruption of bloody civil strife with neighboring Azerbaijan kept the Soviet 
Armenian state on the evening news for months with hazy reports of militias and 
house-to-house fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Armenians in America were frequently displeased with the reporting, claiming 
American news media were insensitive to complex social, political and 
historical distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Armenians around the world were gearing up to commemorate the 
75th anniversary of their people's expulsion from Turkey and were lobbying 
governmental agencies for recognition of their view that the mass deaths during 
that episode constituted the century's first genocide. 
</P>
<P>
The eight former college friends thought the time was right for them to launch 
their news magazine. All were living comfortably in Southern California. Three 
were engineers, two doctors and three in business for themselves. As promised, 
they had kept in touch. 
</P>
<P>
"We just called each other and said, 'Let's do it,' " said Oskanian, a 
34-year-old Los Angeles jewelry store owner with a master's degree in 
international relations from Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, they put up $15,000 each, incorporated Armenian International 
Magazine and set up their headquarters in Glendale with pricey color computer 
typesetting and layout equipment. 
</P>
<P>
All neophytes in publishing, they recruited as executive editor 75-year-old 
Charles Nazarian, an Armenian-speaking retired editor with 55 years experience 
on American newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Nazarian assembled a staff of 44 correspondents around the world and set down a 
standard of objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
"When I edit a story, I never use 'we' or 'I,' " Nazarian said. "For the reader 
to understand that these stories are written independently, we use the third 
person." 
</P>
<P>
However, Nazarian acknowledges that there is an underlying pro-Armenian bias. 
</P>
<P>
"We must remember one thing," he said, "that we are Armenian International 
Magazine. We are going to defend and enhance the Armenian heritage. If there is 
anything derogatory on the outside about the Armenians, we are going to present 
our side. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
A different challenge to AIM's objectivity will be posed by the deep political 
and social rifts that have divided Armenians since early in the century when a 
short-lived Christian state of Armenia was absorbed by the Bolsheviks. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid the infighting that has been common among Armenian publications, many 
of which grew out of political movements, AIM persuaded the editors of five of 
the major Armenian-American newspapers to join its staff as senior editors and 
contributors, a feat that could not have been accomplished, Nazarian said, 
before the shock of the earthquake jolted Armenians toward reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a spirit of unification," Nazarian said. "Ten years ago, 15 years 
ago, I would consider them fanatics. I wouldn't even be able to converse with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The editors sit down monthly for reasoned discussions and, through AIM, are 
reaching for a pan-Armenian voice, Nazarian said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, reaction in the Armenian community has been favorable, if not 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen it in people's hands," said Berdj Karapetian, executive director of 
the influential Armenian National Committee. "I've gotten quite a few positive 
remarks about it from people." 
</P>
<P>
How the magazine will sell within the Armenian community remains to be seen. 
The initial two issues are being given away free. After that, the monthly cover 
price will be $4. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I'm hearing, the biggest challenge is going to be that it's in 
English," Karapetian said. Most influential Armenian newspapers publish in 
Armenian. 
</P>
<P>
AIM officials say that they have 1,500 to 2,000 subscribers and hope within a 
year to launch an Armenian-language version in a joint venture with a publisher 
in Armenia.

STRICTER BAN ON WOOD ROOFS URGED; 
</P>
<P>
FIRE PREVENTION: THE PROPOSAL WOULD FORCE REPLACEMENT ON EXISTING HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale Fire Chief John Montenero this week urged the City Council to give 
Glendale the state's toughest brush fire prevention law by forcing homeowners 
to replace their flammable wood roofs. 
</P>
<P>
He said this would be one way to prevent fires such as the one that damaged or 
destroyed 66 Glendale residences in June. 
</P>
<P>
Many cities, including Glendale, already prohibit flammable wood shingles on 
new residences or in a replacement roof. 
</P>
<P>
Montenero's proposal, based on a suggestion by a councilman whose son lost a 
residence in the June fire, would go a step further by requiring owners of 
existing houses to replace their wood roofs within five to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Fire experts and roofing industry officials said they were unaware of any other 
California city that requires replacement of flammable roofs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's going to cause some interesting court challenges," said Tim Green, a 
spokesman for the National Roofing Contractors Assn. "The roofers are glad to 
do the work, but from the homeowners' point of view, it's going to be a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Green said new roofs cost a minimum of $6,000, but the cost can be 
significantly higher, depending on which materials are chosen and whether the 
house needs structural reinforcement to accommodate the new roof. 
</P>
<P>
In a written report reviewed by the Glendale City Council on Tuesday, Montenero 
and Glendale Fire Marshal Chris Gray said, "The Fire Department recommends the 
city develop and adopt a retroactive ordinance for replacement of all existing 
wood shake and shingle roofs. The roof is the most vulnerable part of a 
building during a home-to-home or brush fire." 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they would discuss the wood-roof ban and Montenero's other 
fire prevention proposals at their annual retreat meeting in Oxnard on Aug. 24 
and 25. 
</P>
<P>
The fire chief said Glendale has nearly 6,000 acres where brush grows. Under 
Montenero's plan, wood-roof replacement would be tied to a residence's location 
on the city's brush area fire-hazard classification map. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners in areas designated as having medium, high or extreme brush fire 
hazards would have to replace their flammable roofs within five years, with a 
two-year extension available in cases of financial hardship. In low-hazard 
areas, homeowners would have up to 10 years to replace their roofs. 
</P>
<P>
The fire chief recommended that the city seek federal money to provide low-cost 
roof replacement loans and that it earmark some redevelopment money for new 
roofs. He also said the city should work with lending institutions to arrange 
low-interest roof replacement loans. 
</P>
<P>
"We know this -- that it takes a combination of mitigation measures to prevent 
a conflagration," Montenero said in an interview. "Conflagration risk involves 
wood roofs, proximity to brush, exterior construction, proximity to slopes and 
the added ingredient of the weather." 
</P>
<P>
The fire chief said he wants Glendale to eliminate one of those risk factors by 
requiring replacement of wood roofs. "The City Council will make that 
decision," he said. "But I'm willing to bring the issue to them." 
</P>
<P>
Montenero's plan follows a recent suggestion by Councilman Carl Raggio, whose 
son lost a hillside residence in the June 27 fire when flames spread from a 
neighboring house with a wood roof. He has argued that neighborhood safety 
should take precedence over a single homeowner's right to maintain a flammable 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we live nowadays, one next to the other, we're really responsible for 
our neighbors as well as ourselves," Raggio said at Tuesday's meeting. "If we 
put enough emphasis on prevention, we're going to have an awful lot less need 
to have the kind of response we had in the fire last June." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Zarian said Wednesday that requiring replacement of wood roofs is a 
commendable idea, but the cost may put too great a burden on senior citizens 
and lower-income families. "How do you enforce it? How do you finance it?" he 
asked. "We all want safety. Sometimes the safety is so expensive, it's 
unaffordable." 
</P>
<P>
Zarian said replacing the roof on his own residence last year cost more than 
$40,000 because of expensive engineering and reinforcement requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he supports most of the other fire prevention measures proposed 
by Montenero. 
</P>
<P>
One of these calls for speedier clearance of hazardous brush on private 
property. The city has a contract with the county to remove hazardous brush. 
But fire officials said the notification and removal process can take one year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the fire chief's proposal, the city would pay for more prompt brush 
clearance, then seek reimbursement from the property owner. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg suggested the city seek volunteers for a brush 
clearance day, similar to graffiti elimination programs. Fire officials praised 
the idea but said they would have to consult the city attorney regarding 
liability issues. 
</P>
<P>
The fire chief also called for replacing native brush on roadside parcels with 
drought-tolerant, fire-resistant vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
The chief proposed tougher building codes in fire-hazard areas. These would 
require new residences to be made of more fire-resistant materials, be equipped 
with automatic sprinklers to protect exposed floor areas and be built at least 
30 feet from an adjacent slope. 
</P>
<P>
Montenero also called for new fire education programs for the public and 
additional training to help city inspectors spot fire hazards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GLENDALE BRUSH FIRE HAZARD ZONES 
</P>
<P>
An ordinance being considered by the Glendale City Council would require all 
homeowners to replace their flammable wood roofs. If approved, residents in 
extreme, high and medium brush fire hazard areas, as defined by the map, would 
have to replace their wood roofs within five years. In low fire hazard areas, 
they would have 10 years to replace the roof.

AZUSA PUTS NEW FACE ON RENTAL UNITS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: A TOUGH INSPECTION LAW HAS RESULTED IN MAJOR REPAIRS AND RENOVATION OF 
RUN-DOWN APARTMENTS. BUT LANDLORDS SAY THE PROGRAM IS COSTLY AND UNNECESSARY.

AZUSA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What Rebecca and Glen Gordon needed when they moved from Utah to Southern 
California was an inexpensive apartment within commuting distance to downtown 
Los Angeles, where Glen Gordon was going to start his new job as an accountant. 
So they moved to Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
What they found was an old building with a lot of problems. During the four 
years they have been living at the Balboa Apartments on Cerritos Avenue, they 
have had to contend with walkways and hallways strewn with trash, broken 
windows, holes in the carport walls and a half-finished exterior paint job. 
</P>
<P>
In January, however, the city stepped in. A tough inspection law that took 
effect last year led city officials to declare the building a public nuisance. 
Slowly, repairs have been made, and it has started looking better. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while, it seemed like no one cared about this building," Rebecca Gordon 
said. "Things are not wonderful now, but there (have) been some improvements." 
</P>
<P>
It's been 14 months since Azusa began its rental inspection program, the only 
one of its kind in the San Gabriel Valley. And during this time, rental 
complexes, such as the Balboa Apartments, have been and continue to be repaired 
and renovated throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, all of the city's 6,500 rental units must pass inspection 
once a year, as well as every time a new tenant moves into a unit. The only 
other city in the San Gabriel Valley that has a similar ordinance is Pasadena, 
which conducts inspections every four years. 
</P>
<P>
During the inspection program's first year, city officials found that 82% of 
rental units failed to comply with housing codes. Problems ranged from missing 
smoke detectors and broken windows to rodent infestation and lack of hot water. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the complexes lacked proper maintenance and much of the needed 
repair work was minor. But among the city's multiunit complexes -- those with 
more than four units -- 50 have had or are going through such major renovation 
as interior remodeling, landscaping and new plumbing installation, city 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Landlord advocates criticize the rental inspection program as costly and 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just another layer of bureaucracy with very little benefit," said Trevor 
Grimm, an attorney who represents landlords. 
</P>
<P>
But to city officials, the program's benefits have been tangible. David 
Rudisel, Azusa's community improvement manager, said city records show that 
about $1.5 million in improvements have been made in rental properties since 
the law took effect in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The program grew out of the Azusa City Council's decision to attack the problem 
of rundown properties. Council members were concerned that slum conditions were 
taking root in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Rental units make up more than half of Azusa's housing stock, so it made sense 
to target that property through an inspection program. Another factor was that 
90% of complaints to city officials about housing involved apartments, Rudisel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was getting worse and worse every year," he said. "We had to do 
something. . . . We had to stop the deterioration and salvage what we had." 
</P>
<P>
Added Mayor Eugene Moses: "There was a time that Azusa was called 'junk city.' 
But the city is being cleaned up. . . . You can see the changes everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The inspection program has not only improved the look of the city, but 
officials are confident that in the long run, it also will improve the city's 
tax base. 
</P>
<P>
"As buildings begin looking better, neighborhoods will start improving, and 
naturally the resale value will go up," Rudisel said. "We have had some 
buildings that have improved their resale value by $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, landlords must immediately fix any life-threatening code 
violations. For other violations, landlords get at least 30 days to bring their 
buildings up to code. 
</P>
<P>
In cases where buildings still do not comply with the law after the allocated 
time, the city can take legal action against the owner, perform the necessary 
cleanup and bill the owner. So far, the city has been forced to sue only two 
landlords; in both cases, cleanup occurred shortly after the lawsuits were 
filed. In about 50 cases, the city has held utility connections hostage until a 
landlord repaired code violations. 
</P>
<P>
Before the program was adopted, Rudisel was the city's sole inspector. He said 
he had time to visit a property only after numerous complaints were filled. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no tools to deal with the problem," Rudisel said. "You had one person 
and a thousand and one complaints." 
</P>
<P>
To pay the salaries of the program's two additional inspectors, fees were set. 
Apartment owners must pay an annual fee of $60 per complex, plus $4 for each 
unit within the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Since the program went into effect, other cities have taken notice. Cities as 
far as Memphis, Tenn., have contacted Azusa for information about it, Rudisel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to home, Santa Fe Springs recently passed an ordinance modeled after 
Azusa's under which apartment units are inspected every year, or when new 
tenants move in. To finance its program, Santa Fe Springs charges an annual fee 
of $50 per apartment unit, plus $25 per unit for re-inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all landlords are bad, but we have found that there are many landlords who 
are not concerned about the property as long as they get their rent on time," 
said Fernando Tarin, director of housing and community preservation for Santa 
Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Landlord advocates find the inspection program's fee provision particularly 
objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Holme, president of the Los Angeles Board of Realtors, said slumlords are 
a minority in the real estate business and that it is unfair to make all 
landlords pay for their mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Running an apartment is not the city's business," added Crisostomo Flores, 
property management director for the Balboa Apartments, which was declared a 
public nuisance in January and is currently being renovated. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said all the violations cited at the complex would have been fixed even 
if the city had not intervened. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Gordon, however, is sold on the need for the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think the owners are in touch with what's going on here. This is 
an investment for them. . . . Their most pressing concern is making money," 
Gordon said. "Cities need to get involved and push the owners to set higher 
standards."

2 CLERICS FACE OFF OVER EXHIBIT IN BATTLE FOR THE 'SOUL' OF AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aside from their status as Protestant clerics, the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon and 
the Rev. James Conn have little in common, but on one thing they agree: Santa 
Monica may soon become the latest battleground in a struggle for the soul of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is an exhibit of the works of artist David Wojnarowicz, and in a 
broader context, whether the federal government's National Endowment for the 
Arts should be allowed to fund such controversial projects. 
</P>
<P>
The Wojnarowicz exhibit, titled "Tongues of Flame," opened uneventfully last 
week at the Santa Monica Museum of Art, despite an apparent effort by Sheldon, 
an Orange County-based conservative firebrand, to organize a protest among 
local church leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which touches on themes of sexuality -- particularly homosexuality -- 
was initially put together with $15,000 from the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
It is, says Sheldon, an example of "government sponsorship of hostility toward 
religion." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, the leader of the Traditional Values Coalition of conservative church 
leaders, says he is marshaling Westside church groups and expects to hold a 
news conference within two weeks to make a pronouncement regarding the exhibit. 
He will not say what is being planned, but he has plenty of time to cause a 
stir -- the show runs through Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Conn, a former Santa Monica mayor and now a United Methodist minister at the 
Church in Ocean Park, is among those opposed to any effort by Sheldon and 
others to limit the rights of Westside residents to view art or limit the 
government's role in funding controversial artists. 
</P>
<P>
Like Conn, some Santa Monica Museum of Art officials and local activists say 
Sheldon has no right sticking his nose into their business. Frankly, they say, 
they resent his attempts to drum up conflict where there is none, thank you 
very much. 
</P>
<P>
To those on both sides, the controversy goes much deeper than the conflicting 
mores of Westside liberals and Orange County conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, known throughout Orange County, in Sacramento and even in Washington 
as "Reverend Lou," claims thousands of conservative churches among his support 
base. As coalition leader, he spends much of his time shuttling across the 
state and nation opposing gay rights and urging churchgoers to oppose 
homosexuality, abortion and other modern-day "evils." 
</P>
<P>
In a confidential letter to Westside church leaders, Sheldon wrote recently 
that the NEA furor is all-important because it determines whether the 
government plays a role in the "struggle for the soul of America." 
</P>
<P>
Conn agrees that such a struggle is under way, but he defines it differently. 
"The people who do not want you to look at art," he says, "do not want you to 
look into the depths of America's soul, or they want to erase it." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the controversy over the Wojnarowicz exhibit is the fact that 
it received NEA funding when on display earlier this year at State University 
of Illinois. By displaying it, the private, nonprofit Santa Monica museum "in 
essence seems to be displaying government sponsorship of hostility toward 
religion," Sheldon told church leaders in his July 17 letter. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, it is not your run-of-the-mill family style art exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Wojnarowicz's work addresses issues of the diminishing natural environment, the 
AIDS epidemic, unfair economics, mortality, government gone awry and social 
stratification. 
</P>
<P>
Like Robert Mapplethorpe, Wojnarowicz (pronounced Wahn-uh-ROW-vich) has become 
a lightning rod for criticism among those opposed to NEA funding of 
controversial art. Already, he is in the middle of a legal battle with 
Mississippi-based Rev. Donald Wildmon over his work and has clashed with NEA 
Chairman John E. Frohnmayer as well. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is billed as the first comprehensive showing of his paintings, 
sculptures, photography and collage. Wojnarowicz, a self-styled bad-boy artist 
from New York, is a former abused child, street hustler and prostitute whose 
gay activism and personal battle against acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
appear as themes throughout his work. 
</P>
<P>
The work, the artist said in an interview, is graphic. "That keeps the blood in 
it," he said. "I like the energy of raw things." 
</P>
<P>
Such rawness upsets Sheldon. "I am told," he wrote church leaders, "the exhibit 
includes photos of men having sex with men and animals." 
</P>
<P>
Museum Executive Director Thomas Rhoads confirmed what a review of the exhibit 
indicates: that, although sex scenes are present, there are "no images of 
bestiality." 
</P>
<P>
When Sheldon got wind that the exhibit was being planned, he organized a 
gathering of local conservative ministers. The July 20 meeting at the Santa 
Monica Church of the Nazarene, held to "discuss options," drew a large turnout, 
he said. Among the possible courses of action discussed, he said, were filing a 
class-action lawsuit or engaging in other means of protest. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Sheldon is planning, he claims to have lots of company. "We have an 
enormous amount of chapters, groups and individuals in the West part of Los 
Angeles and Santa Monica," he said. "There are a lot of things in (the exhibit) 
that are offensive to many, many people for a number of reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Pastor Clarence Crites of the Church of the Nazarene declined to comment on the 
meeting or any plans concerning the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Museum Director Rhoads, meanwhile, said many people have rallied behind the 
museum for showing the exhibit, which is supported in part by private 
contributions in conjunction with the 1990 LA Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Some museum insiders and supporters said what bothered them most about the 
controversy was Sheldon's attempt to export his brand of Orange County 
conservative activism to the Westside, a place long known for embracing 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
"They're saying, 'How dare these people come into our community and tell us 
what we should see,' " said museum official Frances Balcomb. She said the 
exhibit opened to large crowds and no visible protests. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the graphic nature of the work, the museum put up a notice advising 
patrons that viewing the exhibit "is a personal and private choice." 
</P>
<P>
To some, Sheldon's intervention has been a rallying point. 
</P>
<P>
The Ocean Park Community Organization, which draws its members from the 
neighborhood surrounding the museum, circulated a statement saying: "We are 
concerned that individuals from outside our community would attempt to dictate 
what may be exhibited in our neighborhood. If the Rev. Lou Sheldon is offended 
. . . we recommend he skip this engagement." 
</P>
<P>
In response to Sheldon and his allies, Conn said he is planning a performance 
art exhibit at his church to celebrate the tolerant attitude among local 
religious organizations toward art. 
</P>
<P>
That performance, to be titled "Naked in the Church," is set for Nov. 20, and 
may feature some nude performance artists. 
</P>
<P>
In the quiet of the museum this week, the controversy seemed far away. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is very powerful," said Dr. Russell Albright, a New Orleans art 
collector, as he viewed Wojnarowicz's works. "He is a very talented artist," . 
</P>
<P>
"Some of it I like," said one woman who did not want to give her name. "But I 
don't see what got anybody upset in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Wojnarowicz, who has been in Los Angeles in connection with the opening, 
appeared to revel in the controversy and took the opportunity in an interview 
to get off a few shots at Sheldon and his county of origin. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect there is a radioactive dump down there that produces such a high 
concentration of bigots," Wojnarowicz said. 
</P>
<P>
As for why Sheldon had taken such an interest in him, Wojnarowicz said: "It's 
just another sexually insecure person trying to make life difficult for those 
of us who don't conform to his ideas of morality."

INITIATIVE REQUEST DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has refused a request from the La Verne Small Town 
Preservation Committee to put an initiative on the November ballot prohibiting 
construction of theaters and auditoriums that can seat more than 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The committee objects to a 12-screen Edwards Cinema complex proposed for the 
intersection of B Street and Foothill Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Members argued that if the council did not put the measure on the November 
ballot, the city would be forced to spend about $25,000 for a special election 
after the group collects enough signatures. Committee leader Bob Mastro said 
the group has about 1,000 of the 2,500 signatures required to force an 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Thomas Harvey said the special-election argument was an attempt 
to blackmail the council into placing the measure on the ballot before the 
group obtained sufficient signatures.

NO PROSECUTION IN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has, for a second time, 
declined to prosecute Steve Goldbaum, a King's Villages housing project 
security employee who struggled with 28-year-old Robert Earl Holloway before 
Holloway's death Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the city last week, Thomas Trapp, assistant director of the 
district attorney's branch and area operations bureau, said he agreed with a 
previous assessment by the district attorney's office that Goldbaum is not 
legally culpable. 
</P>
<P>
The security dispatcher could not have foreseen that placing his forearm 
against the back of Holloway's neck while Holloway was lying face down on the 
sidewalk could have resulted in death, Trapp wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The matter is being reviewed by the state attorney general's criminal division.

DIAL-A-RIDE VANS REPAIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mystery of the malfunctioning Dial-A-Ride vans has been solved. 
</P>
<P>
The city's six vans broke down in late June during the city's 100-degree heat 
wave, forcing the operator, MediRide, to use rental cars. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was engine heat, combined with high temperatures and reflected heat 
from the asphalt, that caused gasoline in the vans to vaporize and the motor to 
stop running, said Sarah Gallup, the city's Dial-A-Ride coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The solution was the welding of a metal plate between the undercarriage and the 
gas tank to act as a heat shield. Since the plates have been installed, all the 
vans have been put back in service and are operating without problems, Gallup 
said.

HOUSING SUIT PUT ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A legal dispute between Lewis Homes of California and the city will be on hold 
until Jan. 8, 1991, under a formal settlement agreement adopted Monday night by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement gives the city time to review a modified housing development plan 
Lewis has submitted for a tract in the foothills west of Esperanza Drive and 
north of Base Line Road. 
</P>
<P>
The company sued after the city failed to approve an earlier development plan. 
</P>
<P>
Among other changes, Lewis' new plan proposes 186 hillside houses instead of 
230, a development area of 61.9 acres instead of 75.4 and 151 acres retained as 
open area instead of 137. The plan must still go through Planning Commission 
review Wednesday, and a City Council public hearing Nov. 5.

PROBE OF PARKING STRUCTURE A 'WASTE OF TIME AND DOLLARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To ask the Los Angeles County Grand Jury to investigate the Garfield Medical 
Center parking structure (Times, Letters, July 29) is a waste of time, energy 
and taxpayer dollars as well as establishing a new high in the art of 
buck-passing by Monterey Park's officials. 
</P>
<P>
My reasons are as follows: 
</P>
<P>
1. 
</P>
<P>
The plans for the parking structure have remained unchanged since the day they 
were submitted to the Planning Department and the structure was built to the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
2. The plans were available to the public at all times. 
</P>
<P>
3. Prior to approval, testimony was given at every public meeting regarding the 
number of parking spaces and tiers in the structure. 
</P>
<P>
4. The Monterey Park zoning code defines stories, but does not define levels. 
</P>
<P>
5. A parking structure is defined by the Uniform Building Code. 
</P>
<P>
6. The Garfield Medical Center parking structure meets the requirements of the 
Uniform Building Code. 
</P>
<P>
7. The parking structure conforms to the height limit as set forth in the 
Monterey Park zoning code. 
</P>
<P>
8. Although allegations of improprieties and specifically bribe-taking by the 
staff and/or City Council member(s) have been made during public meetings, a 
thorough investigation of the charges has revealed no wrongdoing by anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, an often-heard cry at the Monterey Park City Council meetings 
is: "The sky is falling! The sky is falling!" And that is too bad because it 
prevents the real problems of the community from getting solved.

LANDSCAPING PACT MAY END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dispute between the city and its landscape contractor over piles of debris 
and compost came to the City Council, which voted to end its $1,750-per-month 
contract with the company in 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
But the council agreed to reconsider if Hacienda Landscape Inc. removes the 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners in the vicinity of Hacienda's plant on Carrey Road have complained 
that the piles are an eyesore and draw flies. A 120-signature petition 
presented to the council July 11 accused employees of urinating in public, 
drinking beer on the premises and violating city codes by beginning work before 
7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
At last week's council meeting, Abid Javaid, Hacienda's owner and president, 
promised to have the debris removed and to keep the yard clean. He also offered 
to call the Sheriff's Department if he saw employees urinating or drinking in 
public, saying it might "teach them a lesson."

Facing rising health care costs and competition from larger hospitals, the 
240-bed San Gabriel Valley Medical Center has merged with Burbank-based 
UniHealth America, a network of nonprofit hospitals in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Effective Oct. 1, the medical center will become the 12th hospital to join 
UniHealth America. 
</P>
<P>
Makoto Nakayama, president and chief executive officer of the medical center,

ASSISTANCE FOR SEA LION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Help may still be on the way for Gilly, the young California sea lion with a 
gill net slicing into its neck that has eluded attempts to capture it off 
Malibu's Surfrider Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A Malibu veterinarian has launched a fund-raising campaign to buy a net gun in 
a bid to rescue the injured animal, which often rests on a bait platform a 
quarter of a mile off the Malibu Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nancy Smith said that about $500 was raised Sunday during a benefit "dog 
wash" at the Malibu Animal Hospital, which she owns. About $3,100 is needed to 
buy the instrument, which Smith said would be donated to the county Animal 
Control Department. 
</P>
<P>
The young sea lion attracted widespread attention in February when it was first 
spotted on the platform. Experts say the animal will choke to death unless the 
monofilament net is removed. 
</P>
<P>
The net gun would allow rescuers to shoot a net over the animal at a distance, 
as opposed to trying to throw the net over it. Each time rescuers have gotten 
close to the sea lion on the platform, it has slipped into the water and 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said people interested in helping to buy the net gun may call 456-6441.

DEUKMEJIAN DELETES MONEY FROM BUDGET FOR LA CANADA'S GLOBAL STUDIES PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed global studies program to prepare La Canada High School students for 
the international world of business was among educational items cut from the 
state budget late Tuesday by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
In deleting the proposed $293,000 grant to the La Canada Unified School 
District, the governor said the "project is not as high a priority" as issues 
affecting other school districts that are too crowded. 
</P>
<P>
The grant had been written into the budget by the Legislature at the request of 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale). "I guess the governor wasn't convinced" 
that the program was important enough to retain, Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials had planned to work with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and 
Pasadena Community College in developing the program. It would have been a 
pilot project for similar programs in other districts, Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada district officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

FIRM PAYS FOR UNRULY FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wherehouse Entertainment Inc. has paid the city of Los Angeles $18,076 to cover 
costs for quelling a disturbance that erupted last March when thousands of fans 
attempted to see the British band Depeche Mode at the Wherehouse record store 
on La Cienega Boulevard and 3rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents the area, said he and Wherehouse 
President Scott Young negotiated the amount. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this will serve as an incentive to other companies to think a little 
more responsibly before they leap into ill-advised promotional events," 
Yaroslavsky said. "Because they, not the taxpayers, are going to foot the 
bills." 
</P>
<P>
More than 130 police in full riot gear were called out to disperse at least 
5,000 fans who gathered at the Wherehouse store where members of Depeche Mode 
were signing records. Seven people were hurt in the ruckus that occurred when 
excited youths tried to crowd into the store. 
</P>
<P>
Young said record store officials were shocked by the high attendance at the 
event and agreed shortly after the incident to reimburse the city. Yaroslavsky 
praised the company for "exhibiting an admirable degree of corporate 
responsibility."

ENGINEERS RECOMMENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Public Works has voted to recommend the hiring of a 
San Francisco engineering firm to conduct a hydrology study of the Venice 
canals. 
</P>
<P>
The board recommended to the City Council and Mayor Tom Bradley that the city 
hire Phillip Williams &amp; Associates to perform the $152,000 study, which is 
being paid for by the city and the state Coastal Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to consider the matter in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Public Works officials said they are recommending Phillip 
Williams because the firm had previously written a hydrology report on the 
canals for the Coastal Conservancy and is being considered for a state contract 
to conduct a tidal flushing of nearby Ballona Lagoon. The department sought no 
other bids for the project, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The hydrology study will examine the quality of water in the canals and analyze 
ways to improve water flow. City officials said the study is needed before the 
city can move forward on various proposals to restore the canals, which will 
involve improving water quality and rehabilitating disintegrating banks.

suspension from baseball for gambling, his conviction and five-month jail 
sentence for tax evasion hasn't hurt the popularity of his video, dubiously 
titled "Baseball the Pete Rose Way." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the week after Rose's sentencing, the video was checked out from the 
Thousand Oaks Library. And librarian Mike Gilman said it has been rented 
consistently over the last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it's an instructional tape and has nothing to do with his personal 
activities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeepers Creepers . . . Here's one for all the science-fiction fans out there . 
. . way out there. Tickets have gone on sale for the Ojai Film Society's Aug. 
26 showing of the 1957 movie "The Incredible Shrinking Man." Following the film 
will be a discussion on science-fiction movies past and present. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of science-fiction experts will analyze the film and compare it to last 
year's Disney film "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids." Among the speakers will be 
Richard Matheson, who wrote the original "Shrinking Man" story and screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
Film Society founders Sally and Mike Janover have arranged for special effects 
expert Tom Smith to discuss his craft. He has worked on "Honey, I Shrunk the 
Kids," as well as on two films in each of the "Star Wars," "Star Trek" and 
"Indiana Jones" series. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's Tony and Nancy Lawrence, writers and producers of some "Twilight 
Zone" and "Outer Limits" episodes, will also attend. This science-fiction fest 
will be held at Ojai's Thacher School beginning at 6 p.m. Tickets are $10 in 
advance, $15 at the door. Call 646-8946. 
</P>
<P>
You may have noticed that unlike last summer the Ojai Film Society hasn't been 
showing any movies the last couple of months. Why not? 
</P>
<P>
"No one comes," said Mike Janover. "We found that there was too much 
competition with the summer blockbusters. We tend to lose money anyway, but we 
really lose money when no one comes." 
</P>
<P>
A big problem, Janover said, is that he can only show his films at the Ojai 
Playhouse on Sunday afternoons. "In summer the days are longer. The idea of 
going to a movie at 4:30 in the afternoon when they could be playing golf . . . 
they don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
But beginning Sept. 16, with "Cinema Paradiso," the films will be playing once 
again. On the schedule are "Time of the Gypsies," "Sweetie," "Women on the 
Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," "Drugstore Cowboy," "The Man With Two Brains," 
"Raging Bull," "Longtime Companion," "Aguirre, Wrath of God," "Tom Jones" and 
"The Adventures of Milo and Otis." LEO SMITH

ART: THE GETTY EXHIBIT OF VIVIDLY COLORED ILLUMINATIONS, SOME DATING FROM THE 
12TH CENTURY, DEPICTS HUNTING, NATURE, JOUSTING AND CHESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Think of illuminated manuscripts, and you think of monks piously bending their 
tonsures over religious texts. 
</P>
<P>
But this summer, visitors to the J. Paul Getty Museum who can tear themselves 
away from Van Gogh's "Irises" can glimpse a very different kind of treasure: 
examples of illuminated manuscripts that deal not with religious concerns, but 
with such secular preoccupations as how to win when betting on a chess match. 
</P>
<P>
Ranee Katzenstein, assistant curator of manuscripts, helped organize the 
exhibit, which runs through Sept. 30. A Harvard Ph.D. who wrote her 
dissertation on Venetian manuscripts, Katzenstein chose leaves from 18 
illustrated books for the exhibit, the earliest dating from the 12th Century, 
the most recent a calligraphy manual from the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
As Katzenstein points out, the majority of medieval books were religious in 
nature. But the Getty exhibit documents some of the more worldly interests of 
the people who made and bought books before and shortly after Gutenberg's 
invention of movable type in the 15th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a real sense of people from their books, especially if you can open 
their books and see what they've highlighted and underlined," Katzenstein said. 
Among the interests reflected in the hand-written and hand-illustrated books on 
exhibit: hunting, history, literature, the law, nature, jousting and chess. 
</P>
<P>
The book of chess problems, dating from the late 1300s, is organized according 
to how many moves are required to win each game because it was the custom in 
northern France, where the book was produced, to bet on that number, 
Katzenstein said. The volume is called "Bonus socius," a reference to the 
author's description of himself in the introduction as "a good companion" -- at 
least at the gaming table. 
</P>
<P>
If the books consisted of nothing but text, they would be invaluable, but they 
are doubly so because they are illustrated. The small paintings that are part 
and parcel of the works are picture postcards from a world that no longer 
exists. As a result, she said, "we can see how the 14th Century played chess." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the illustrations in a 12th-Century treatise on canon law, we can 
also see that medieval Frenchmen sometimes wore soft shoes with filigree 
designs and pointed toes. From the painting of a pair of elephants in a 
13th-Century French bestiary, we can be fairly certain the artist never saw one 
in the flesh -- the fanciful pachyderms look like black haystacks with trunks. 
</P>
<P>
To protect the manuscripts, whose colors are more vivid than most old movies, 
the lights in the exhibit hall are kept low. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the best preserved medieval paintings are in books because they were 
kept closed," she said. Like their religious counterparts, many of the secular 
manuscripts gleam with gold leaf or paint. Some also feature ultramarine blue, 
a pigment made by crushing lapis lazuli, which was as costly as gold. All but 
one of the books shown was written on vellum, parchment made from animal skin. 
Because of its beauty and durability, vellum remained popular for lavish 
literary productions even after paper became widely available in Europe in the 
14th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The illustrations vary enormously in sophistication. Some are almost 
cartoon-like. A 13th-Century creature with an animal's head and human legs 
looks like a Maurice Sendak beast in "Where the Wild Things Are." In some 
paintings, people and objects are as flat as in the tapestries that were being 
produced in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the illuminations are extraordinarily beautiful. Among the most 
exquisite are the watercolors of flowers, insects, animals, nuts -- even a 
cooked lobster -- that Georg Hoefnagel did in the late 16th Century for a model 
book of calligraphy by Georg Bocskay. 
</P>
<P>
According to Katzenstein, Hoefnagel was a pivotal figure in Netherlandish art 
-- the last great Flemish illuminator and one of the first and most influential 
artists in the emerging field of still-life easel painting. The manuscript, a 
superb work of calligraphy illuminated with genius, "is one of our treasures," 
Katzenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Also hauntingly beautiful is the view of soldiers marching into a city at 
night, painted by an artist known as the Master of the White Initials in a copy 
of Jean Froissart's "Chroniques." The book was made in Bruges at the end of the 
15th Century, probably for King Edward IV of England, when that Flemish city 
was a major artistic center. 
</P>
<P>
According to Katzenstein, the powerful often commissioned and collected books 
that glorified the deeds of their ancestors, and the Froissart includes a 
lengthy account of the exploits of Edward's Plantagenet ancestor Richard II. 
</P>
<P>
When the oldest book in the exhibit was made, learning -- and books -- were 
concentrated in the great monasteries of Europe. Later, universities began to 
supplant the monasteries as intellectual centers. By the 14th Century wealthy 
individuals were amassing large private libraries. "There is a whole shift, 
documented in a small way in the exhibit, in who has access to information," 
Katzenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the exhibit spotlights secular matters, there is no clear-cut 
distinction between the worldly and the other-worldly in the earliest 
manuscripts, Katzenstein said. She points to a painting from a 13th-Century 
French bestiary that shows two fishermen who have built a campfire on the back 
of a whale, thinking it was an island. The whale symbolizes Satan, always ready 
to trick the unwary. "It is a characteristic of the Middle Ages that you 
moralize the natural world," she said. "Everything is a reflection of the 
divine order." 
</P>
<P>
The distinction between church and secular law was similarly blurred. On 
display is the only known copy of the "Vidal Mayor," a collection of the laws 
of Aragon in northeastern Spain compiled in the 13th Century. Besides detailing 
the laws on felling trees and other mundane matters, the code also contains 
laws of great theological import such as those on the conversion of Jews and 
Moors. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the religious values of the Middle Ages are reflected in the exhibit, 
so are the humanistic values of the Renaissance, Katzenstein said. By the 15th 
Century, wealthy scholars, particularly in Italy, were commissioning classical 
Greek and Roman works (ironically, many pagan texts were rediscovered in 
monastic libraries). 
</P>
<P>
Renaissance book-lovers liked more than the ideas and language of the Greeks 
and Romans, Katzenstein said. They also liked the clear, rounded script in 
which many of these rediscovered classics were written. This rounded writing 
style, which actually dates from the post-classical 8th and 9th centuries, not 
from Greek or Roman times, drove spiky, hard-to-read Gothic script out of 
fashion, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Evident in a 15th-Century Florentine manuscript, this script is the direct 
ancestor of how we write today.

TEMPORARY JURIST TO REPLACE AILING JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale Municipal Court officials have been authorized to appoint a temporary 
jurist to replace an ill judge who has been unable to work. 
</P>
<P>
A temporary court commissioner is expected to be named by Aug. 20 to replace 
Judge Cheryl Krott, who has been off the bench since June 22. 
</P>
<P>
The court's presiding judge, Charles E. Horan, declined to describe the 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
Krott has had two surgeries since last August, Horan said. It is uncertain 
whether or how soon she will return to the courtroom. Retired Judge Samuel 
Laidig has substituted for Krott but will leave the position Aug. 17, Horan 
said. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted July 24 to authorize a 
temporary jurist. 
</P>
<P>
Krott joined the bench in 1983 as a commissioner and was made a judge in 1986, 
court officials said.

INSPECTION PROGRAM PUTS NEW FACE ON AZUSA RENTAL COMPLEXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELENA FARRINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What Rebecca and Glen Gordon needed when they moved from Utah to Southern 
California was an inexpensive apartment within commuting distance to downtown 
Los Angeles, where Glen Gordon was going to start his new job as an accountant. 
So they moved to Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
What they found was an old building with a lot of problems. During the four 
years they have been living at the Balboa Apartments on Cerritos Avenue, they 
have had to contend with walkways and hallways strewn with trash, broken 
windows, holes in the carport walls and a half-finished exterior paint job. 
</P>
<P>
In January, however, the city stepped in. A tough inspection law that took 
effect last year led city officials to declare the building a public nuisance. 
Slowly, repairs have been made, and it has started looking better. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while, it seemed like no one cared about this building," Rebecca Gordon 
said recently. "Things are not wonderful now, but there (have) been some 
improvements." 
</P>
<P>
It has been 14 months since Azusa began its rental inspection program, the only 
one of its kind in the San Gabriel Valley. And during this time, rental 
complexes such as the Balboa Apartments have been and continue to be repaired 
and renovated throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, all of the city's 6,500 rental units must pass inspection 
once a year, as well as every time a new tenant moves into a unit. The only 
other city in the San Gabriel Valley that has a similar ordinance is Pasadena, 
which conducts inspections every four years. 
</P>
<P>
During the inspection program's first year, city officials found that 82% of 
rental units failed to comply with housing codes. Problems ranged from missing 
smoke detectors and broken windows to rodent infestation and lack of hot water. 
</P>
<P>
Most complexes lacked proper maintenance, and much of the needed repair work 
was minor. But among the city's multiunit complexes -- those with more than 
four units -- 50 have had or are going through such major renovation as 
interior remodeling, landscaping and new plumbing installation, city officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Landlord advocates criticize the rental inspection program as costly and 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just another layer of bureaucracy with very little benefit," said Trevor 
Grimm, an attorney for landlords. 
</P>
<P>
But to city officials, the program's benefits have been tangible. According to 
David Rudisel, Azusa's community improvement manager, city records show that 
about $1.5 million in improvements have been made in rental properties since 
the law took effect in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The program grew out of the Azusa City Council's decision to attack the problem 
of run-down properties. Council members were concerned that slum conditions are 
taking root in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Rental units make up more than half of Azusa's housing stock, so it made sense 
to target that property through inspection. Another factor was that 90% of 
complaints to city officials about housing involved apartments, Rudisel said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was getting worse and worse every year," he said. "We had to do 
something. . . . We had to stop the deterioration and salvage what we had." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Eugene Moses added: "There was a time that Azusa was called 'Junk City.' 
But the city is being cleaned up. . . . You can see the changes everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The inspection program has not only improved the look of the city, but 
officials are confident that in the long run, it will also improve the city's 
tax base. 
</P>
<P>
"As buildings begin looking better, neighborhoods will start improving, and 
naturally the resale value will go up," Rudisel said. "We have had some 
buildings that have improved their resale value by $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, landlords must immediately fix any life-threatening code 
violations. For other violations, landlords get at least 30 days to bring their 
buildings up to code. 
</P>
<P>
In cases where buildings still do not comply with the law after the allocated 
time, the city can take legal action against the owner, clean it up and bill 
the owner. In about 50 cases, the city has held utility connections hostage 
until a landlord repaired code violations. 
</P>
<P>
Before the program was adopted, Rudisel was the city's sole inspector. He said 
he had time to visit a property only after many complaints were filled. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no tools to deal with the problem," Rudisel said. "You had one person 
and a thousand and one complaints." 
</P>
<P>
To pay the salaries of the program's two additional inspectors, fees were set. 
Apartment owners must pay an annual fee of $60 per complex, plus $4 for each 
unit within the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Since the program began, other cities have taken notice. Cities as far as 
Memphis have contacted Azusa for information, Rudisel said. 
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Los Angeles County, Santa Fe Springs recently passed an ordinance 
modeled after Azusa's, under which apartment units are inspected every year, or 
when new tenants move in. To pay for its program, Santa Fe Springs charges an 
annual fee of $50 per apartment unit, plus $25 per unit for reinspection. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all landlords are bad, but we have found that there are many landlords who 
are not concerned about the property as long as they get their rent on time," 
said Fernando Tarin, director of housing and community preservation for Santa 
Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Landlord advocates find the inspection program's fee provision particularly 
objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Holme, president of the Los Angeles Board of Realtors, said that slumlords 
are a minority in the real estate business and that it is unfair to make all 
landlords pay for their mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Running an apartment is not the city's business," added Crisostomo Flores, 
property management director for the Balboa Apartments, which were declared a 
public nuisance in January and are being renovated. "They should just leave it 
up to the landlords; they are the experts." 
</P>
<P>
Flores said all violations cited at the complex would have been fixed anyway 
had the city not intervened. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rebecca Gordon, the renter from Arizona, is sold on the need for the 
program: "I just don't think the owners are in touch with what's going on here. 
This is an investment for them. . . . Their most pressing concern is making 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"Cities need to get involved and push the owners to set higher standards."

CYCLIST KILLED BY MOTORIST ON PCH;

<P>
TRAGEDY: SUSPECTED DRUNK DRIVER IS BEING HELD. THE VICTIM WAS A LIFEGUARD AND 
AN AVID TRIATHLETE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Tracy Clarke was always drawn to the sea, and it is there that her ashes will 
be scattered. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, a 26-year-old lifeguard and avid triathlete from Malibu, was killed 
early last Sunday by a suspected drunk driver as she and four friends started a 
70-mile bicycle ride up the Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Clarke, a good-natured blonde with an easy smile and a fondness 
for working with children and senior citizens, has stunned her relatives and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"If there ever was a symbolic person to rally around, this beautiful, athletic 
woman would be it," said Bob Carmichael, who said he only met Clarke the night 
before her death. He said cyclists have been trying to get bike paths and 
warning signs along the coast highway for years so such tragedies could be 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Condolence calls by the dozens began streaming in immediately after Clarke's 
death, said her mother, Pamela Sandmore of Calabasas. "The love that has come 
out of this child's death is absolutely amazing to me," Sandmore said. "This 
kid touched a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service for Clarke will be held Friday at 4 p.m. at the recreation 
center at Paradise Cove in Malibu. The funeral will be private, and her mother 
said her daughter's desire to be cremated will be heeded. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who graduated from USC with a degree in gerontology, was a lifeguard at 
Point Mugu and Leo Carillo state beaches, and worked at an Agoura convalescent 
home, Sandmore said. She spent several hours a day biking, running and 
swimming, and was fond of canoeing and other water sports. 
</P>
<P>
According to California Highway Patrol officers and Richard Hudspeth, who was 
bicycling alongside Clarke, the accident occurred about 8 a.m. on the 
northbound shoulder of Pacific Coast Highway just north of Decker Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was a wide expanse of road, the driver of a Datsun B210 suddenly 
drove onto the shoulder and ran over Clarke's bike, throwing her 80 feet into 
the air, said Hudspeth and CHP Officer Vicki Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke's companions "heard the noise, turned around and saw the Datsun leaving 
the scene with the bike still underneath it," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
Hudspeth said that he and a doctor who happened to be driving by administered 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation to Clarke, but that she had no pulse. Clarke was 
airlifted by Los Angeles County firefighters to Westlake Medical Center in 
Westlake Village, where she was pronounced dead on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Danilo Herrera, 20, of Los Angeles, was arrested farther up the road. He was 
charged Tuesday with four felonies: vehicular manslaughter, felony drunk 
driving, driving under the influence, and leaving the scene of an accident 
where injuries occurred, Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera "apparently had been drinking," and was on his way to the beach with a 
friend, according to Warren, who said no blood alcohol test results were 
immediately available. Bail for Herrera was set for $100,000, and he remained 
in jail Wednesday pending an Aug. 8 preliminary hearing in Malibu Municipal 
Court, Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, a member of the Team Malibu triathlon team, was bicycling Sunday as 
part of her training for a competition in Canada. She was to have left next 
Wednesday. In her place, Team Malibu will be sending three members to compete 
in her memory, including Hudspeth, a longtime friend, Warren said.

Golfer Arnold Palmer's car company has a shot at owning Claremont Auto World, 
now under the supervision of a bankruptcy trustee, if the U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
approves the proposed sale. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Proestos, Claremont economic development director, said the city 
redevelopment agency has agreed to loan $750,000 to provide working capital for 
Arnold Palmer Automotive Group Holdings Inc., whose investors include Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
Proestos said the loan agreement, which is being reviewed by attorneys for the 
agency and the buyer, includes a commitment by the Palmer firm to put up 
$750,000 of its own money and to repay the loan at 12% interest over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Once the agreement has met the approval of attorneys, it will be submitted to 
bankruptcy trustee Jeffrey C. Coyne, who, Proestos said, has agreed to 
recommend Arnold Palmer Automotive Group to the bankruptcy court as a qualified 
buyer. Proestos said she could not disclose terms of the proposed purchase. 
Neither Coyne nor officials of the Arnold Palmer Automotive Group, which is 
based in Florida, could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the auto park, which included Cadillac, Pontiac, Acura and 
Hyandai dealerships, is vital to the city's financial health because it 
provides about half of the city's $2 million a year in sales tax revenue, 
Proestos said. 
</P>
<P>
The auto park, which opened in 1986, ran into financial difficulties last year 
after it was acquired from its original owner by Joseph Wilson. General 
Electric Capital Corp. claimed Wilson had failed to meet payments on more than 
$20 million in loans from the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
The auto business was forced into receivership in February. Wilson filed for 
reorganization under the federal bankruptcy laws in April, bringing the 
business under the control of a bankruptcy trustee. 
</P>
<P>
Proestos said that although Palmer is among the new investors, the active 
participants will be James O'Neal, who is chairman of the Arnold Palmer 
Automotive Group, which operates 20 car dealerships in several states, and Don 
Massey, who heads Cadillac dealerships in Michigan and Colorado.

PICO RIVERA HIRING 'MAINTENANCE' AIDES TO CURB CRUISING BY YOUTHS

City officials are interviewing candidates to become bargain-rate soldiers in 
the war on the city's legendary cruising problem. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to hire 15 to 20 "maintenance aides" to set up or move 
traffic-control barricades at the direction of officers from the Sheriff's 
Department and California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The aides will work from about 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. on Wednesdays and weekends and 
save the city up to $200,000 in salary costs. 
</P>
<P>
Local law-enforcement agencies typically set up barriers to prevent cruisers 
from entering residential neighborhoods and to keep the traffic flowing. On a 
busy cruising night, up to 100,000 youths will descend on Whittier and Rosemead 
boulevards to show off their cars and socialize, slowing traffic to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
Pico Rivera spent about $400,000 last year to control cruising. The city had 
been paying public-works employees overtime to set up barriers. That cost the 
city about $18 an hour per worker.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: BUSY BEE CAFE; 
</P>
<P>
A TASTE OF 1940; 
</P>
<P>
IF YOU ARE HUNGERING FOR THE PAST, A MEAL AT THE BUSY BEE CAFE MIGHT MAKE YOU 
THINK TWICE.

<P>
"What's the matter?" the waitress asked. "You didn't like the eggs? 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry," she said over her shoulder as she walked away. 
</P>
<P>
I had expected better, much better, since the Busy Bee Cafe always comes up 
when discussing breakfast in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
This restaurant has been under the same ownership for at least the past 30 
years. In 1988 it was remodeled to arrive at its own version of nouveau diner, 
complete with orange Naugahyde booths, the perennial interior neon signs, lots 
of old movie posters and the usual jukebox full of oldies but goodies. 
</P>
<P>
While the Bee may be trying to give us the full flavor of the '30s and '40s, a 
meal there might make you think twice about those wonderful days of yore. As I 
watched the waitress saunter off, leaving me with a plate of eggs that reminded 
me of the stuff I might have used to patch a tire on the 1949 Chevy convertible 
I once owned, I wondered whether those old diners were really worthy of all 
this nostalgia. Yes, the portions then were hearty -- as they are at the Busy 
Bee. But the service in those good old days, if the movies tell the truth, was 
usually perfunctory, provided by a fading blonde with a heart of gold. 
</P>
<P>
A real diner, of course, served homemade food. So does the Bee. But when they 
designed the french fries they departed from authenticity -- the skins are 
still on, but I like them. 
</P>
<P>
Those old diners used lots of salt and pepper. Here the Busy Bee also takes a 
few liberties: Its potatoes, although apparently a house specialty, had almost 
no seasonings. I tried hard to find flavor in them. Even the onions couldn't 
keep them from being bland. The corned beef hash could be described the same 
way -- and it lacked even the onions. The biscuits did nothing to distinguish 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
I must admit that the chili I had at lunch one day was savory, perhaps because 
the kitchen didn't stint on the meat or the chili spicing; it was a satisfying 
dish. That was the same day I had a chocolate malt. Don't laugh, but sometimes 
I like my malts made with buttermilk. After the usual weird look when I 
ordered, they cheerfully made it the way that I wanted. It came across the 
counter cold, chocolaty and rich. 
</P>
<P>
The fried chicken, if you can wait seven or eight minutes for it to get cool 
enough to eat, is moist on the inside, crisp on the outside, just as it should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
If breakfasts are a big thing there, so are the desserts. I don't know why they 
have such a great reputation, unless it's due to their size. The bread pudding 
is watery and the giant chocolate chip cookies are overcooked and grainy. Worst 
of all, the house specialty, Beulah's hot apple dumpling, is too sweet and 
lacks that particular, doughy consistency common to good dumplings. 
</P>
<P>
The Bee's coffee probably isn't much different than it was 50 years ago -- 
except that instead of being a nickel or a dime, it's now 85 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the old diners weren't really as good as the late-night movies keep 
telling us they were. In that case, the Busy Bee is a fine replica. And to 
those who go regularly for breakfast -- or dessert -- well, perhaps what 
they're really after is the flavor of nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: Busy Bee Cafe, 478 E. Main St., Ventura, (805) 643-4864. 
Breakfast, lunch and dinner 6 a.m.-10 p.m. Monday-Friday, 7 a.m.-10 p.m. 
Saturday-Sunday. Beer and wine. No credit cards. Breakfast, lunch or dinner for

TEAMS TIPPING OFF THEIR SEASON EARLY; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL SQUADS ARE LOGGING DOZENS OF GAMES THIS SUMMER IN 
PREPARATION FOR THE NOVEMBER CAMPAIGN. 
</P>

<P>
With four starters returning and a 6-foot-11 sophomore joining the team, La 
Canada High probably will have its best basketball season during the coming 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
"Talent-wise, I think it can be (the best team)," Spartan Coach Tom Hofman 
said. "We're way ahead of where I've ever had a team. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot is going to depend on development." 
</P>
<P>
Basketball season, of course, does not begin until the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
But, like most high school coaches, Hofman does not leave much to chance. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Southern and City sections do not regulate the number of games a 
team may play during the summer, high school basketball players see voluminous 
amounts of supervised court time. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the first week in August, for example, La Canada will have 
completed a summer schedule of almost 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
"We get pretty much the max out of each summer," Hofman said. 
</P>
<P>
So do most other Glendale-area programs. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley will be in Las Vegas this weekend, putting the finishing 
touches on a 26-game summer calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Ribet Academy, the defending Southern Section Small Schools Division champion, 
played 25 games and several members of the Fighting Frogs participated in 
all-star camps. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to do it because everyone else is doing it," said Hoover Coach Kirt 
Kohlmeier, whose team played about 25 games this summer, including two 
tournaments. "If you didn't do it, it would be like losing a season." 
</P>
<P>
Hofman, who played at Pasadena High in 1969-70, said summer leagues are all the 
rage because gym space no longer is available for pickup games. 
</P>
<P>
"When I played in high school, we had open gyms where you were playing against 
good competition five nights a week," said Hofman, who has coached La Canada to 
three consecutive Rio Hondo League championships. "But now there aren't open 
gyms because of insurance liability. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids just don't have the opportunity to play pickup games like they used to." 
</P>
<P>
However, high school basketball players do pick up and go. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada, for example, played seven games in two days earlier this summer 
because of scheduling snafus in two tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans recently began a day with a game at Dorsey High in South-Central 
Los Angeles. Then they drove to Pomona College in Claremont for a game, 
returned to Dorsey for an afternoon contest and headed east again to Claremont 
for a nightcap. La Canada finished 2-2 on the day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our worst day," said Hofman, whose team was 36-9 entering this week. 
"But we lost to some good teams." 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley, a perennial playoff participant, doesn't play as many games 
as La Canada but the Falcons don't get cheated when it comes to sharpening 
their skills. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley Coach John Goffredo is one of the few coaches who conducts 
workouts during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley players practice from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., help run a youth camp 
from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., then work as parking attendants at the Hollywood Bowl in 
the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the kids are getting worn out," Goffredo said. "It's definitely more 
hectic than the regular year. 
</P>
<P>
"Every one wants to keep up with the Joneses, so no one wants to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Not all coaches, however, are even willing to start. 
</P>
<P>
Subscribing to the theory that it's better to be good in January rather than in 
the summer, St. Francis Coach John Jordan scheduled only 12 games for the 
Golden Knights this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We use it (summer league) as a gauge for individuals, not so much the team," 
Jordan said. "We also share a lot of athletes with other sports at the school, 
so we don't want to overburden them." 
</P>
<P>
From its summer program, each school will unearth a potential starter or 
contributor for next season. 
</P>
<P>
At La Canada, 6-11 sophomore Richard Mandeville will replace departed Louie 
Nieto at center and could be the player who helps the Spartans advance past the 
Southern Section 3-A quarterfinals, which have been a stumbling block in each 
of the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Christian Burgess emerged as Crescenta Valley's leading scorer 
this summer and St. Francis benefited from inspired play by sophomore guard 
Rudy Martinez and senior guard Tim Mathy. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard Dave Ulloa led a group of eight solid players at Hoover and junior 
forward Ken Vera and junior guard Tim Ramessar established themselves for Ribet 
Academy. 
</P>
<P>
"Summer basketball allows players to gain confidence in themselves because 
they've played a lot of games against bigger, stronger, and in most cases older 
kids," Ribet Academy Coach Mike Miller said. "That pays off when they come back 
for the regular season with their confidence at an all-time high."

THEATER REVIEW: 'DAMES AT SEA'; 
</P>
<P>
CHOPPY WATER; 
</P>
<P>
A PARODY OF 1930S MOVIE MUSICALS IS UNEVEN IN PLACES BUT IT SHOWS SOME PROMISE 
AS WELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Santa Barbara-based producers, operating under the name Starlight 
Entertainment, are moving their base of operations to Ventura County. If their 
first production in the area, "Dames at Sea," is any indication, they've 
seriously underestimated the average level of local theater. 
</P>
<P>
A parody of '30s movie musicals, "Dames" is not without merit. The show is 
intentionally threadbare, written to accommodate a minimum cast of four men and 
three women, all of whom sing and dance. Authors George Haimsch and Robin 
Miller have arranged things so that additional singers and dancers can 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
What the authors probably didn't have in mind is for one of the actors to play 
two different roles, a decision that leads to members of the audience wondering 
if one character is supposed to be the other's long-lost twin brother. 
</P>
<P>
Such a plot development wouldn't be too far out of range for "Dames," a show 
that was voted Best Musical of the Year (1968) by the New York Outer Circle 
Critics. The story revolves around opening night at a Broadway theater that is 
soon to be leveled and turned into a skating rink. Ruby, a young, naive, 
aspiring singer-dancer, just off the bus, lands a part in the show. Dick, a 
sailor who's also a composer and who has picked up the suitcase the ingenue 
inadvertently left at the depot, turns out to be from the same small town she 
is from. 
</P>
<P>
Will the show go on? Will boy get girl? Will other unlikely coincidences ensure 
a happy ending? If you have any doubts about the answer to any of these 
questions, you'd better head for the Ojai Arts Center immediately -- this will 
obviously be your first musical. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Korten is winning as Dick the sailor (a part he played in Santa Barbara 
several years ago), and Daniel Vivanco is capable enough as Lucky, his sidekick 
-- think Donald O'Connor, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Muir plays Mona Kent -- the star of "Dames at Sea," the 
play-within-a-play, as an amalgam of Mae West, Miss Piggy and, especially, 
Bette Midler. Juliann Lyon comes close to stealing the show as wisecracking 
chorine Joan, the Ann Sothern prototype. Like most of the rest of the cast and 
production staff, all are from the Santa Barbara area. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Arnette sings nicely but isn't particularly convincing as the small-town 
girl, Ruby. For the purposes of this production, she and Dick are from Ojai, a 
touch that's supposed to add an extra chuckle. Since they're supposed to be 
from the sticks, director and co-producer Tom Zeiher could have come up with 
something funnier -- Meiners Oaks, for instance. And Charles Triane shares the 
otherwise unrelated roles of producer Hennessey and a Navy captain. 
</P>
<P>
Austria Joy Godkin's character, Ginger, fades into the scenery -- the writers' 
fault, probably, not the actress's. 
</P>
<P>
The sets and costumes, by Korten and Lyon respectively, show some imagination 
-- except for one sequence, in which the chorus girls are supposed to be 
wearing raincoats. Instead, they're clad in nylon jackets imprinted with 
Ventura County Fire Department. That may be intended as a joke, like "Ojai." 
But since the play takes place in Manhattan, the joke makes no sense at all. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible, given the nature of "Dames at Sea," that the dancers are 
supposed to lumber somewhat. If so, Cheryl Sington's choreography and the 
dancing triumph. But much of the opening night's pacing -- with actors pausing 
for laughter that only came occasionally -- says otherwise. Both pacing and 
coordination may improve with experience, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Producers Barbara and Tom Zeiher are to be given credit for using live 
musicians -- pianist Marjorie Hutton, bassist Abbie Beauchamp and percussionist 
Emmanual (Bucket) Baker -- for the production numbers, though the show's 
overture is prerecorded. The intermission music, consisting of authentic period 
hits, is a delight. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai Arts Center Theater is a swell place to see shows, air-conditioned and 
with plenty of parking outside and an art gallery to stroll through before the 
show and during intermission. Not without charm, "Dames at Sea" is a 
semi-promising launch for a new local company. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: "Dames at Sea" plays Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and 
Saturday and Sunday afternoons at 2:30, through Aug. 11. Tickets are $14 for 
evening performances; $11 for the matinees. There's a $1-per-ticket discount 
for groups of 15 or more. The Ojai Arts Center Theater is located at 113 S. 
Montgomery St. in Ojai. For reservations or other information, call 964-3688 or

THEATER REVIEW: 'WIZARD OF OZ'; 
</P>
<P>
MUNCHKIN CITY; 
</P>
<P>
BASED ON THE 1939 MOVIE, THE SHOW AT THE ENCORE THEATER HAS INTRICATE DANCES 
AND FINE SLAPSTICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With a cast of more than 50 singers, dancers and actors, "The Wizard of Oz," 
currently playing at the Encore Dinner Theater in Ventura, is an ambitious 
production. More important to the audience, though, it's a highly entertaining 
show -- as the song goes, a whiz of a "Wiz." 
</P>
<P>
The stage production is an adaptation, by Frank Gabrielson, of the 1939 MGM 
film. All of the movie's most popular songs are included, though some 
characters are eliminated and the plot is changed somewhat to facilitate 
staging. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, we meet Dorothy, Uncle Henry, Aunt Em, various witches, the trio of 
Scarecrow, Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion, and the Wizard himself. But the 
flying monkeys we remember as henchmen to the Wicked Witch of the West have 
become "Spirits," and Dorothy seems to have misplaced her little dog, Toto. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, this production has plenty of Munchkins, those tiny citizens 
of Oz portrayed by little people in the film and by a whole passel of 
youngsters on the Encore stage. And there's a henchman for the Wicked Witch of 
the West who resembles Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster. The Sprits 
dance to Gounod's "Funeral March of a Marionette," a melody more closely 
identified with Alfred Hitchcock than with Oz. 
</P>
<P>
Prepared for those practically negligible differences, it's easy to enjoy this 
"Wizard" on its own terms. Director Gary Bruce Sayles and choreographer Aron 
Mandelbaum don't just manage to keep everybody onstage from constantly bumping 
into one another (an accomplishment in its own right), they give the characters 
interesting things to do, ranging from rather complicated dances to a fine 
piece of slapstick in which the evil spirits almost successfully divert Dorothy 
and her friends from the road to Oz. 
</P>
<P>
Shani Harriott is a talented Dorothy, winning hearts early on with her a 
cappella rendition of the verse to "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" (prerecorded 
backing tracks come in for the chorus and most of the rest of the songs). 
</P>
<P>
The trio of fellow travelers play their parts pretty much like their movie 
counterparts, with loose-limbed Kevin Davis particularly notable as the 
Scarecrow, Al Schurmann nonthreateningly bellicose as the Lion and Joseph Louis 
Garces III not too stiff as the Tin Man. 
</P>
<P>
The young Munchkins turn in commendable performances, with Merrick McMahon 
appearing as the Mayor and Casey Anderson turning in an amusing evocation of 
the movie Munchkins' tiny little voices. 
</P>
<P>
As if he didn't have enough to do, director Sayles also appears as Uncle Henry 
and an official of Oz, though nothing is made of the physical resemblance 
between some Oz people and the folks back home in Kansas, as the film did. 
</P>
<P>
The songs come across nicely, with the human voices combined with those 
prerecorded tracks. Paula Jones is credited as musical director. Also worthy of 
note is the scenery, including several backdrops illustrating numerous stops in 
Kansas and Oz. Mike Bollow is the stage manager. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: "The Wizard of Oz" plays Thursday through Saturday nights, 
with Sunday matinees, through Aug. 18. Ticket prices range from $13.95 to 
$25.95, depending on the performance. Group rates are available, as are (for 
selected performances) discounts for children under 13 and seniors 55 and up. 
Full dinners are served on Friday and Saturday nights, there's soup, sandwiches 
and chips on Thursday, and a Sunday brunch. Reservations are mandatory; call 
(805) 656-3922.

CONSERVANCY SWAPS CONTROL FOR SUPPORT; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: AGENCY AGREES TO UNUSUAL RESTRICTIONS TO GET SUPERVISORS TO PUT 
PARKS BOND MEASURE ON BALLOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has made unusual compromises with the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors that sharply limit what land it could 
buy using bond proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy, a state agency that buys land for public parks in the Santa 
Monica Mountains and other nearby ranges, agreed to the compromises in a 
last-ditch effort to persuade supervisors to place the proposed $816-million 
bond issue on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
One compromise grants supervisors veto power over certain conservancy land 
purchases; another guarantees that the conservancy will not compete with the 
County Sanitation Districts for landfill sites in mountain canyons. 
</P>
<P>
The bond measure -- thought to be the largest in county history -- would 
generate funds for a wide array of projects, from restoring beaches and public 
gardens to removing graffiti in inner-city neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is backed by an odd-bedfellows coalition ranging from Sierra Club 
members to anti-gang activists. Millions of dollars from the bonds are 
earmarked for gang-prevention projects such as building Outward Bound-style 
wilderness camps. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors Tuesday postponed a scheduled vote on whether to place the bond 
issue on the ballot. They must decide by next Tuesday in order to meet the 
legal deadline for November ballot issues. 
</P>
<P>
At least three supervisors -- Mike Antonovich, Ed Edelman and Kenneth Hahn -- 
support it, their spokesmen said. Supervisor Pete Schabarum is opposed. 
Supervisor Deane Dana, who pushed the conservancy for the compromises, remains 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy officials and other backers hope to get as many supervisors as 
possible behind the bond issue, which requires approval by two-thirds of the 
voters in November. Recent bond issues, statewide and in other counties, have 
passed by margins only slightly above 66%, and proponents of the Los Angeles 
County measure worry that opposition by powerful supervisors could damage its 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy infuriated some county officials recently by maneuvering to 
keep county sanitation officials from purchasing mountain canyons for garbage 
dumps. In December, the agency bought 145 acres of land at the mouth of Towsley 
Canyon near Santa Clarita, effectively blocking truck access from the Golden 
State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
In intense negotiations with supervisors in recent weeks, the conservancy 
agreed not to use any of the $80 million it would get from the bonds to buy 
land identified by the county for potential dump sites. 
</P>
<P>
The parks agency also agreed not to buy property astride access routes to such 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy officials further agreed to give supervisors veto power over 
conservancy efforts to buy land in unincorporated county areas using bond 
proceeds -- a move conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston called "an 
unprecedented compromise for a state agency." 
</P>
<P>
"What do we do? We're at the mercy of the Board of Supervisors. . . . If they 
don't put it on the ballot, it doesn't get on the ballot," Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the compromises give county waste-disposal officials a "big strategic 
window of opportunity" to buy potential landfill sites in canyons that the 
conservancy might otherwise try to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
Provided it passes in November, the bond measure nonetheless would provide a 
huge windfall to financially strapped public agencies seeking funds to 
rehabilitate local parks, beaches, museums and other recreation-related 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the county would receive $332 million for projects ranging from 
restoring trout streams to improving the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
Cities would receive $243 million to use for specific projects such as 
acquiring wildlife habitats, building sports complexes and improving beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The bond measure also represents a bonanza for the cash-strapped conservancy, 
which would receive $80 million directly and be eligible for another $35 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the bonds was originated by Esther Feldman, who works for an arm 
of the conservancy that provides park services in Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties. Feldman also helped run the successful 1988 campaign for Proposition 
70, a statewide bond issue that generated $776 million for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said the measure has been endorsed by 47 of the county's 86 cities, 
including Los Angeles. It is also endorsed by local Sierra Club chapters, the 
League of Women Voters and dozens of other groups. 
</P>
<P>
However, several cities oppose the measure, arguing that they would pay more to 
amortize the bonds than they would receive in bond revenues. 
</P>
<P>
James B. Hendrickson, city manager of Palos Verdes Estates, said that according 
to his calculations, only nine cities in the county would get more than they 
would pay, even without including interest costs on the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cities would receive $348 million in bond revenues, they would pay 
$744 million in bond principal alone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson said that he "can't get straight figures" from the conservancy 
about how much property taxes would have to be raised to repay the bonds and 
that he doesn't believe that backers have thoroughly analyzed the bonds' true 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said Hendrickson's complaint that only a few cities would get more than 
they pay is "highly misleading" because it doesn't take into account benefits 
that residents will enjoy from improvements in regional facilities such as 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"We all go to the beaches, regardless of what city we're in," she said. "To 
assume that the $50 million going to the county for beaches doesn't benefit you 
because the beach isn't in your city is ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said the bonds would cost the average property taxpayer an extra $8.50 
annually over the bonds' 20-year amortization period. She said different tax 
rates she gave out earlier this year were based on "a couple of assumptions 
which now have changed," including different interest rate projections. 
</P>
<P>
She said the figure for the tax rate increase was drawn up by a Los Angeles 
investment banker who favors the bond issue and who volunteered his time. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson said the county should not be issuing bonds for parks when it has 
so many other pressing funding needs, such as providing shelter to the homeless 
and improving County-USC Medical Center, which recently was placed on 
conditional accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
But, Feldman said, enhancing parks, beaches and other recreational facilities 
is a vital concern to many residents worried about increasing urbanization and 
a deteriorating quality of life in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Schabarum said he opposes the parks bond issue because it is 
only one of five property- or sales-tax increases that could be on the November 
ballot. Schabarum said the measures will not only raise taxes but add to the 
county's bond debt. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman countered that the county is in good financial health and can easily 
afford the park bonds. She said debt payments represent less than 2% of the 
county's budget, well below the 5% limit recommended by Standard &amp; Poor's, 
a nationwide credit-rating agency.

SUE SALLY HALE, A PIONEER FOR WOMEN IN THE SPORT, HAS EARNED THE RESPECT OF HER 
COLLEAGUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It's too bad that Sue Sally Hale doesn't have to write an essay on "What I Did 
on My Summer Vacation." Not many people could top this Moorpark grandmother's 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Hale, who turns 53 this month, has just spent six weeks playing professional 
league polo in France where her team won eight of nine games to finish second 
overall in the Mallet of Gold tournament at the Polo Club de Bouloy. She also 
played in a women's promotional polo tournament at Deauville for Jacomo 
perfume. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a trial by fire," said Hale, who is widely considered the Grand Dame of 
Women's polo in America. "I learned to do things that I didn't think I could do 
under the best conditions." Hale replaced her daughter, Sunny, who played for 
the first weeks of the tour but returned home to resume her duties as manager 
of the Glendale Polo Club near Chicago. Sunny had warned her mother that 
playing in France "was kind of different," adding that it might be fun, "but 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Hale confirmed that after a 20-hour flight, she found herself on a rock-hard 
field playing in games that she compared to a Monty Python event. This was 
unlike the game of strategy, which she has taught to many professional players 
and celebrities including Doug Sheehan and Parker Jamison. 
</P>
<P>
"Over there it seems that nobody knows where the ball goes. You just hit it and 
then run to find it." 
</P>
<P>
Hale said they also played on wet grass where a sudden turn at 30 m.p.h. could 
result in a fatal fall. "I was also scared to death driving a rig, with seven 
head and two trailers, 9,000 m.p.h. down those tiny roads," Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades Hale has been a pioneer in developing American 
women's polo into a recognized competitive sport, now played at several college 
campuses and equestrian clubs around the country. The latest figures of the 
United States Polo Assn.'s membership reveal 418 female members. Only 350 women 
are players with an assigned handicap, another 55 are unrated students, and 28 
are non-playing associates. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, when Hale was one of the first three women officially admitted to the 
century-old USPA, she was then rated the top woman player in the nation. She 
had a "two goal" handicap, which she now shares with only a handful of women. 
She has been the subject of several magazine and newspaper articles and her 
achievements have earned her a place in the Smithsonian Institution's section 
on Women in Sports. 
</P>
<P>
Hale and two of her daughters teach and play polo professionally. 
Twenty-one-year-old Sunset (Sunny) shares the highest indoor and outdoor rating 
for U.S. women players with her sister Stormie, and two others. Stormie, who is 
25 and the mother of Sue Sally's 10-month-old granddaughter Victoria, runs the 
family's H and H Farms. According to Stormie, their Moorpark Polo Club, 
established in 1986, is "currently the only teaching club in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Bob McConihay, a former student and a contractor from Newbury Park, said that 
"Sue Sally's place makes it possible for the average person with only one horse 
to come out and play weekend polo without owning a string of ponies and 
equipment. And you play safe here." 
</P>
<P>
"We've grown up with horses," said Stormie, who also trains polo ponies. "I 
remember when we were kids living in Carmel Valley, a lot of nights we'd sneak 
out and sleep in the barn with our ponies." 
</P>
<P>
Their equestrian enthusiasm comes from their mom. Hale showed me an ardent note 
she had written to her mother at 12 vowing to become "a bronc buster or a polo 
player." 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up like a wild Indian in the hills of Hollywood," said Hale, whose 
stepfather, actor-stuntman Richard Talmadge, became her mentor after her 
father's death. While attending Westlake School for Girls with celebrities 
including Jane Fonda and Gary Cooper's daughter, Maria, she occupied herself 
with swimming and riding. As a preteen, she qualified for the Olympics in 
swimming but chose to concentrate on riding. 
</P>
<P>
At 15, under the tutelage of polo greats Duke Coulter and C.D. LeBlanc, she 
played with men's teams at the now-defunct Riviera Country Club and at Will 
Rogers State Park. 
</P>
<P>
She would disguise herself as a boy by applying mascara to her upper lip, 
wearing a loose shirt and tucking her braids under her helmet. "After a game," 
said Hale, "it was a kick to clean up for the parties and mingle unrecognized 
with the guys I'd just played on the field with." 
</P>
<P>
At 16, Hale began applying for USPA membership, something she did annually 
until succeeding in 1972. "I had been teaching men to play polo for years," she 
said, "and I wanted to play on the field with them in official tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
Hale married Alex Hale in 1957 and moved to the Monterey Peninsula where sons 
Brooke and Trails, and daughters Stormie, Sunset and Dawn were born. In 1963 
she established the Carmel Valley Polo Club, the first such club on the 
peninsula since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Besides teaching riding and polo, Hale taught horse management and riding at 
Monterey Peninsula Community College, and wrote articles for the local 
newspaper and for national horse and polo magazines. She also became an 
emergency medical Technician and received commendations for her work as a 
volunteer firefighter. An accomplished artist, Hale majored in illustration and 
cartooning in college and has won several poetry contests. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Hale led her team to win the first USPA-sanctioned Women's Western 
National Polo Tournament. Ten-year-old Sunny played on the team as the youngest 
member of the USPA along with Stormie, who was 14. 
</P>
<P>
Never one to rest on her laurels, Hale is already scouting a sponsor for a 
women's team from Ventura County to compete in the U.S. Women's Open, which 
will be held in December at the Empire Polo Club in Indio. The four-woman team 
will consist of the three Hale women and Carolyn Anier, the highest rated woman 
player in France. 
</P>
<P>
At the Women's Open, Hale, as usual, will play "reality" not "posh" polo, 
driving her own horse trailer and sleeping under the stars during the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
And whether she is playing with men or with women, Hale adheres to a very 
strict code of ethics. She avoids rude language, keeps commitments and always 
plays fairly, safely and honestly. To prove that women players are reliable, 
she played through all five pregnancies and even finished a game after she had 
broken her leg. 
</P>
<P>
She considered it a compliment when an opponent once remarked, "There's one 
thing worse than death -- Sue Sally Hale."

THE VENTURA DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION OFFERS CHILDREN'S CLASSES IN 
SAVING THE PLANET.

<P>
If your child chides you for wasting water or tossing out a soda can, here's a 
way to channel that environmental energy. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's Department of Parks and Recreation is offering a series of four 
Saturday classes designed for children 6 to 11 years old who are tuned in to 
saving the planet. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Earth Keepers," the classes will teach children about the earth through 
games, crafts, experiments, nature walks, videos, music and special guests. 
</P>
<P>
The classes will be held at Arroyo Verde Park from 10 to 11:30 a.m., beginning 
Saturday. Each class is $5, and children can enroll in one or all of them. 
Parents are encouraged to attend the classes at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
To register, go to the recreation department at City Hall, 501 Poli St., Room 
226. Or register by telephone with a credit card by calling 658-4726. 
</P>
<P>
The first class, entitled "Rain Forests in Danger," will teach children the 
importance of the rain forests, why they are diminishing and what can be done. 
They'll see a World Wildlife Fund video called "Rain Forest Rap." They will 
also play some games, do a craft and take a nature walk -- all designed to help 
them understand better what a rain forest is. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a lot of active things -- they won't just sit around," said 
Sharol Nelson-Embry, senior recreation leader for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Endangered wildlife will be featured in the second class, Aug. 11. The children 
will learn which animals are on the endangered species list, why, and what is 
being done to protect them. Nelson-Embry said live animals, possibly a hawk, 
may be brought in for a demonstration, and there may be a slide show. The 
children will sing environmental songs by the Banana Slugs String Band, which 
was featured during Ventura's Earth Day celebration. 
</P>
<P>
In the third class, the children will delve into water conservation in a 
playful way. They'll divide into teams and compete in a quiz about water. 
They'll do experiments to see how plants use water, and they'll work on a craft 
project that relates to the water cycle. The high point of the session will be 
a visit from "Water Woman," -- alias Lana Sherman of the city's water 
conservation office -- who will appear in rain garb and talk about saving 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The last class on Aug. 25 is entitled "Saving the Planet." It will focus on a 
number of practical measures that can be taken to preserve the Earth -- 
everything from recycling and pollution to planting trees. 
</P>
<P>
Using trash, the children will create a piece of art. They will see a video, 
"The Lorax," based on a Dr. Seuss book about cutting down trees. They also will 
get a visit from "Recycling Pete," a special guest from a bottle company. 
</P>
<P>
"These are designed as parent-child classes," said Nelson-Embry. "Parents can 
come and help, and learn and interact with their kid." 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: Ventura's Department of Parks and Recreation is offering a 
series of four Saturday classes, entitled "Earth Keepers," for children 6 to 11 
years old. The class runs from 10 to 11:30 a.m., beginning Saturday. The cost 
is $5 a class. For more information, call 658-4726.

As she spoke, Kelly Bahry rolled her eyes and took on that exasperated look 
teen-agers get when they think one of their parents is doing something 
particularly un-parentlike. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time she's not on that thing is when she's working or sleeping," 
chided 16-year-old Kelly, sounding much like a parent herself. "She plays 
Shanghai by the hours. She used to play with about five other women, but now 
that's doubled. The telephone rings more for her than it does for me." 
</P>
<P>
Jo Bahry, 53, can only laugh as her daughter tells of Mom's "disease." For 
Bahry is an Appleholic, dependent on the family's Apple IIGS personal computer. 
She uses it to play games, do word processing, keep track of her nursing work 
and put together graphics displays for her husband's collectibles business. And 
when she's not tinkering with her computer, Bahry is eager to read or talk 
about computing. 
</P>
<P>
Peer pressure is partly to blame for Bahry's addiction. After buying her Apple 
three years ago, the Carlsbad resident began attending meetings of the North 
County Appleholics computer users group in Oceanside. By sharing their 
knowledge and experience with Bahry, club members soon had taught this computer 
neophyte all about bits and bytes, monitors and mice, disks and data bases. 
</P>
<P>
Bahry is one of hundreds who belong to North County computer users groups. 
These clubs, also called special interest groups (SIGs), are made up of people 
who use the same computer or software programs, or have the same computing 
interests. They meet regularly to swap information, solve problems and provide 
motivational support for each other when their machines seem to be getting the 
best of them. 
</P>
<P>
Most meetings are informal, and beginners are as prevalent as computer 
veterans. A typical meeting features a demonstration of a new software program 
or piece of equipment, either by a manufacturer's representative or a group 
member who is well-versed on the product. There is usually a 
question-and-answer session where, as one group member noted, "The only stupid 
questions are the ones you're afraid to ask." Afterward, attendees break up 
into small groups to discuss their specific interests. 
</P>
<P>
Bahry, a certified nurse-midwife at UCSD Medical Center, uses her Apple to keep 
statistics on deliveries. She credits the Appleholics with helping her master 
her machine. 
</P>
<P>
"I would make a list of all the questions I wanted to ask, bring the list to 
the meetings, and then ask away. Now I've gotten to the point where I can 
answer other people's questions. And I do a lot of networking outside the 
meetings," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bahry's husband, Ted, keeps a safe distance from the computer, 
daughter Kelly puts in some keyboard time when her mother is away, and has 
started accompanying her to Appleholics meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom was spending so much time at it that I wanted to see what the big deal 
was," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There is a range of age groups represented in the user groups, but seniors 
account for a large portion of the membership. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll see a lot of gray heads," said George King, president of the 60-member 
IBM group in Oceanside. "Seniors have the time to devote to the groups, and the 
older folks are very much into computers. But we also have a lot of young 
members, high school and college students.

"Our oldest member? I guess that would be me, at age 78." 
</P>
<P>
King, a retired editor of a Boston computer trade magazine, became active in 
the IBM group five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"My No. 1 job is to bring somebody in each meeting to discuss a piece of 
hardware or software," he explained. "On top of that, we all bring our problems 
to the meetings, and we see if others can help us find the answers. We more or 
less teach each other." 
</P>
<P>
One seniors group, the Computer Club at Leisure Village Ocean Hills in 
Oceanside, is composed of computerphiles age 55 and up. A recent count showed 
that 121 of the 1,300 Ocean Hills households had memberships in the club. 
</P>
<P>
The group has made a computer room available to other clubs at Ocean Hills, and 
members are in the process of teaching other residents how to use the word 
processing software. 
</P>
<P>
Burke Belknap, 66, who helped found the club in February, 1989, works part time 
as a marketing engineer and full time as a computer fanatic. At the July 
meeting he and guest lecturer Mel Koch, using a desktop publishing program, 
designed a logo for the club's newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Balknap proved to be a magician with the mouse, scurrying the input device over 
a rubber pad and deftly producing images on the monitor screen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an addict," Belknap said. "I now have 100 to 150 programs, but if I live 
to be 120, I will probably have only half of the ones I want." 
</P>
<P>
Belknap recalled a time when, as a member of an Orange County group, his 
computer's cursor refused to move. He phoned a fellow member at 10 p.m. and 
asked, "What the hell do I do now?" 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest days of my life was when someone first called me and said, 
'What the hell do I do now?' " Belknap said. 
</P>
<P>
While many groups take a general approach to their meetings, others are very 
specific. For example, the Personal Ancestral File Computer Genealogy group of 
Escondido is made up of people who use the PAF software program to trace their 
family trees. 
</P>
<P>
PAF users create data bases to hold and sort their genealogical research, and 
can use modems to tap into the massive genealogical library maintained by the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
"The computer doesn't do the work for you, but it certainly makes the work 
easier," said Berta Lee MacDonald, who two years ago organized the group, an 
arm of the Escondido Genealogical Society. 
</P>
<P>
"I received a disk that had 1,500 listings for people by the name of Combs, my 
maiden name. The program allowed me to compare that list with the one I already 
had. That can save a lot of time when you go to the library to look at vital 
statistics and census files." 
</P>
<P>
The success of users groups often depends on the popularity and availability of 
the computers and software they support. For example, Apple's Macintosh is a 
hot computer these days, and there are at least 14 thriving Mac groups in San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
However, the problems of Solana Beach-based Kaypro Corp. -- a wildly successful 
personal computer manufacturer in the early '80s that has since slid into 
bankruptcy -- led to the recent demise of a Kaypro users group in Encinitas. 
K-North, a band of Kaypro enthusiasts in Oceanside, has decided to open its 
doors to users of other computers, and the North Coast Kaypro group of Del Mar 
has been reduced to a one-man consulting service. 
</P>
<P>
K-North was originally for Kaypro users only, but the manufacturer's recent 
woes and the proliferation of IBM-compatible computers forced the club to 
broaden its base. 
</P>
<P>
"Our group is constantly getting referrals from Kaypro, since the company is no 
longer able to offer much support to users," said Bob Boomer, K-North 
president. "If the company doesn't survive, we'll probably have to offer all 
the support." 
</P>
<P>
Before Kaypro adopted the MS-DOS operating system, it used the CP/M (Control 
Program/Monitor) system, now considered a dinosaur. Some 45 North Coast Kaypro 
members once shared their love for the CP/M machines, but now George Guy is the 
lone member. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a very active club for a number of years," said Guy, of Solana Beach, 
"but we quit having monthly meetings about six months ago because so many 
members drifted to IBM machines." 
</P>
<P>
Although the group is inactive, Guy continues to help those who have questions 
about the Kaypro CP/M. He welcomes callers, many of whom have been referred to 
him by the company, and maintains a library of CP/M public domain software for 
others to use. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five North County owners of Texas Instruments-99 computers have banded 
together to keep their computer of choice alive. 
</P>
<P>
"The TI-99 came out about 10 years ago and was discontinued five years ago, but 
the computer refuses to die," said Rancho Bernardo resident Richard Hay, 
newsletter editor for the North County TI-99ers, who meet in Escondido. "There 
are probably 10 million people still using the TI-99, and new programs and 
equipment are still being developed for it. Very few places are sources for 
these programs, and we know where they are." 
</P>
<P>
Hay calls the TI-99 the "closet computer." 
</P>
<P>
"Our group is particularly intended for people who bought their computers years 
ago and put them in a closet because they didn't know what to do with them," he 
said. "We want to let them know there are programs for the TI-99, and that we 
can help them find and use them." 
</P>
<P>
Loyalty to a computer is nowhere stronger than with the ERACE (Electronic 
Resources Atari Computer Enthusiasts) group of Vista. There are only about 15 
members, but it is a close-knit group that believes the Atari is not getting 
the respect it deserves as a serious computer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the Rodney Dangerfields of computer users," said Atari enthusiast Steve 
Schwarz of Carlsbad. "IBM, Apple, and Macintosh are firmly entrenched in the 
minds of Americans, but Atari -- which is the No. 2-selling computer in Europe 
-- can emulate them without losing anything. People still think of Atari as 
someone using a joystick to play a game in front of the TV." 
</P>
<P>
One group that is no longer active is DIG-SIG North for the disabled. However, 
North County residents are invited to attend the San Diego DIG-SIG meetings, 
held in the North Park area. In addition to helping the disabled solve their 
computer problems, DIG-SIG also takes donated equipment and loans it to members 
who are unable to buy their own. And while 30 to 50 usually attend the 
meetings, more than 1,000 have used the DIG-SIG electronic bulletin board from 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be lost among all the technical benefits of users groups is the 
uncomplicated experience of having fun and meeting people. 
</P>
<P>
As ERACE/Ocean Hills group member Chuck Essenberg said, "When computer users 
meet, they're friends for life."

SKYLINE STILL LEADS THE CLASS IN ALTERNATIVE TEACHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARILYN TOSTADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is both a simple and revolutionary idea: non-traditional classrooms in the 
public school system. 
</P>
<P>
Although the idea is well-established at the Skyline School in Solana Beach, it 
is one that has not been championed in most school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Four classrooms at Skyline are committed to an alternative education program. 
Children of different ages and abilities are grouped in the same classroom, 
studying in an environment that pays special attention to their individual 
interests and needs. 
</P>
<P>
Parents work side by side with the teachers to keep the adult-to-pupil ratio 
low. Kids are encouraged to pursue learning at their own pace and may remain 
with the same teacher for several years. 
</P>
<P>
In Linda LaGrange's primary classroom, seven boys and girls of various ages sit 
at a large table. They are completing and illustrating this sentence. "Animals 
should definitely not wear clothing because . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"They would be too long," a small girl writes. The last child to finish prints 
laboriously, "Dogs can't wear shoes," under his drawing of a Doberman. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a girl lies on a large piece of paper. Her outline is being traced so 
she can cut it out and create a life-size paper doll of herself. It will be 
displayed on a bulletin board with the words, "ELLA, CHILD OF THE WEEK." 
</P>
<P>
A little boy in a wheelchair listens as another child demonstrates his Space 
Light Sword during Open Sharing. 
</P>
<P>
The specialized program at Skyline School was created in 1978 at the urging of 
a group of parents who wanted an alternative to the traditional classroom 
without having to leave the public school system. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in the program has remained strong in the dozen years it has been 
operating, said Berge Minasian, principal at Skyline School. This past school 
year, there were 96 students in the four alternative classrooms, with students 
from kindergarten through sixth grade. The alternative classrooms coexist at 
Skyline with traditional classrooms. Altogether, there are 553 students at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Participation in the program is voluntary and there is a waiting list to enter 
the program. Within a year or so, though, interested students usually make it 
into the program, Minasian said. For the next school year, class assignments 
have been made already. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the program accepted students from throughout North County. 
When the method of school funding for the district changed, enrollment was 
limited to residents of the Solana Beach School District -- with the exception 
of students already in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Minasian said the district, which has been recognized nationally for 
educational excellence, does not offer the alternative classes because it 
believes they are better than traditional classes, but because it believes 
parents and students should have choices. 
</P>
<P>
The right of parents to seek alternative programs at public schools is actually 
guaranteed by state law. The parent or guardian of any pupil may request the 
governing board of a school district to establish an alternative school 
program, participation in which must be voluntary. If parents are interested is 
seeing an alternative program established, Minasian urges them to first speak 
with the local principal about it. Depending on what is recommended, the next 
step might be to contact the district superintendent. Minasian said he also 
would be happy to share his experience in the program with anyone interested in 
establishing one. 
</P>
<P>
The Skyline program makes two firm requirements of parents: 1) They must come 
and observe the program before signing up their child. 2) They must agree to 
actively participate in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"If parents want enrichment, they have to come," said teacher LaGrange. "One 
teacher can't do it all. Without their help this program wouldn't be here -- I 
would be too tired." 
</P>
<P>
LaGrange worked with parents to establish the program back in 1978. "We wanted 
our children to develop as individuals. "We didn't want our kids to be labeled. 
Here they can work in small groups -- according to their ability -- not their 
age." 
</P>
<P>
One thing volunteers help with is in typing and covering the books the children 
write themselves. The young authors love to announce, "I'm ready to publish." 
Thirty self-authored books fill one bookcase. 
</P>
<P>
"These children are more aware of the diversity of human beings. They 
appreciate each other," LaGrange said. ". . . We are trying to find a place 
where everyone can do well." 
</P>
<P>
Jane Johns is both a parent and an aide in Ollie Stein's class of children, 
aged 7 to 9. "My daughter has been in the program for five years. She didn't 
feel confident about her reading at first, but she has risen above her 
difficulties. She just devours books now, and she did it on her own," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The children enjoy the camaraderie of the mixed-age groups. Everyone helps 
each other. If you can't get it, you don't feel inferior. There's not big 
pressure because you're not as smart as others. Everyone is smart in his own 
way," said Johns, who looks forward to her kindergarten-age son starting the 
program in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Mayo observes the alternative program from the room next door, where she 
tutors Spanish-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
She describes a scene from the alternative classroom of 10-to 12-year-olds 
taught by Jim Summers: "When a baby hummingbird fell out of its nest, a child 
took it to the classroom and wrapped it in Kleenex. Since the children all 
wanted to help, Jim said to the class, 'Whoever takes this bird home has to 
wake up every hour and feed it with an eyedropper.' 
</P>
<P>
"A boy who had an ornithologist living next door volunteered, nursing it until 
it could fly. When he brought it back to school the bird flew around the room, 
perched on a kite -- and flew away." 
</P>
<P>
In the spring, the students, their families and teachers went camping in the 
Anza Borrego Desert. Mayo said that, before the trip, they pitched a tent at 
the school and took turns sitting inside, planning ahead for what they would 
need. 
</P>
<P>
"These classes accommodate every style of learning. Each child can fit in, in a 
lot of different ways. Handicapped children who can benefit are mainstreamed 
into the program. All the different races are represented. Parents share 
stories of their cultures," Mayo said. 
</P>
<P>
On Fridays, there are hootenannies, led by teachers LaGrange and Stein. "The 
learning-disabled and the Spanish-speaking join the group singing American folk 
songs like 'She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain,' while one parent plays the 
banjo and another the piano," Mayo said. "It's very festive, uplifting. . . . A 
wonderful way to end the week."

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: A RAINBOW OF SUSHI AT NOBU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyway you slice it, sushi is not every man's meat. 
</P>
<P>
But these morsels of sweetened rice garnished with raw or fresh seafood, egg 
omelet, Japanese-style pickles and other tidbits do have their moments, 
especially when constructed by someone who knows that the seaweed wrapper 
should be affixed from right to left -- except on those occasions when it must 
be tied from left to right. 
</P>
<P>
Kazunobu Tsushima, formerly a sushi chef at Samurai in Solana Beach, recently 
opened Nobu in the same coastal city. He offers about 40 kinds of sushi, or 
about one for each of the 44 years he says he has spent in the trade. 
</P>
<P>
The attractively remodeled space in a small strip center on Highway 101 has 
housed many eateries in the past decade, and, although the place looks tiny 
from the outside, it opens up into two spacious dining rooms and three bars: 
One for sushi, one for the grill cooking called teppan yaki and one for 
cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
In the sushi bar one recent evening, four grade school-aged youngsters snapped 
up eel and herring roe sushi as eagerly as their peers gulp burgers and fries. 
The sushi choice is rainbow-wide (there is, in fact, a colorful offering called 
the "rainbow roll") and ranges from the simplicity of blue tuna, to sea urchin, 
octopus and salmon skin. The nigiri tray offers a good selection that suffices 
as an appetizer for two or three diners; all the various morsels sampled had a 
uniformly fresh, sweet taste and seemed carefully composed. 
</P>
<P>
The Nobu dinner menu runs to nearly exhausting length. Although it offers much 
that is familiar, it includes a number of traditional but relatively elaborate 
preparations that only a handful of local establishments go to the trouble to 
serve. Among these are shioyaki, a choice of chicken or salmon baked in salt; a 
box dinner that includes an artful arrangement of small portions of many 
different foods; the seafood soup-stew called yosenabe, and shabu shabu, an 
elegant cook-it-yourself meal whose onomatopoeic name, to the Japanese ear, 
enunciates the sound made by chopsticks swirling through simmering broth. Shabu 
shabu and table-cooked sukiyaki, however, can only be ordered in the teppan 
yaki room, so plan ahead. The teppan cooks grill up seafood, steaks and chicken 
in a meal that is a Japanese approximation of an American barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
Meals include a relatively rich version of the ubiquitous miso soup and a 
simple salad that, despite its iceberg lettuce base, is made delicious by a 
tangy, ginger-flavored dressing. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner list continues with the usual teriyaki and tempura, but expands 
pleasantly with the squid cutlet (crisply breaded and slashed into tender 
mouthfuls) and a pungent, well-executed ginger pork. 
</P>
<P>
The portions would be considered large anywhere, and are almost astonishing for 
a Japanese restaurant; an order of yosenabe arrived in a vast earthenware bowl 
that held enough broth, vegetables, transparent noodles, fish, crab legs, 
shrimp and scallops for two or three diners. This Oriental version of 
bouillabaisse featured the expected sweet broth, but it lacked any special 
character, and the seafood, on the whole, seemed overcooked. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely the same comments could be made about an order of kitchen-prepared 
sukiyaki, which, except for the paucity of meat, was served in immense 
quantity. The whole dish again seemed rather tired and forlorn, and, although 
all the right ingredients were present, they seemed unappreciative of one 
another's company. 
</P>
<P>
Other specialties include an appetizer of asparagus, wrapped in thin slices of 
beef and grilled (aspara-maki), and a nine-course "gourmet" dinner priced at 
$35 per person. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert selection consists of three ice creams, each decidedly Japanese: 
green tea, ginger and red bean. The last sounds the least likely, but is sweet 
and pleasantly offbeat.

A Soviet passenger plane carrying 30 people from Armenia to the disputed 
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh crashed into a mountain Wednesday, killing 
everyone aboard, a member of the Armenian Parliament said. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Simonyan said that wreckage from the aircraft, a Yak-40, and several 
bodies were found in rugged territory near Agdam, a town just outside 
Nagorno-Karabakh in the republic of Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian government and Soviet aviation officials declined to confirm that 
the aircraft had crashed, saying only that the plane was missing and that a 
search was continuing.

IRAQ, KUWAIT TALKS ON BORDER AND OIL DISPUTES COLLAPSE;

Talks aimed at defusing a potentially explosive oil and border dispute between 
Kuwait and Iraq collapsed Wednesday when Iraqi officials, apparently unwilling 
to ease their multibillion-dollar claim for money and territory, abruptly 
returned to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement later to the official Iraqi News Agency, Deputy Prime Minister 
Sadoun Hammadi said the delegates gave up on the talks in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, 
because they "did not see any seriousness by the Kuwaiti officials in tackling 
the major damage inflicted on Iraq due to their recent behavior and stands 
against Iraq's fundamental interests." 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti officials, clearly stung, said the talks collapsed because Kuwait 
refused to "give in" to Iraqi demands. They said they are ready to hold further 
talks in the Iraqi or Kuwaiti capitals. 
</P>
<P>
A London-based military analyst said there were unconfirmed reports that Iraq 
was moving more troops toward the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
Similar rumors circulated throughout the European oil markets Wednesday 
afternoon, and although Kuwaiti officials denied the reports, a variety of 
analysts and diplomats here said it would not be unexpected for Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein to move troops or initiate jet flights over disputed border 
territory in coming days as a show of force. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the situation is very serious," said the analyst, who specializes in 
the Persian Gulf region. "The Iraqis have just upped the ante. They will 
continue to talk. But that doesn't preclude a military operation just to scare 
the hell out of the Kuwaitis," said the analyst, who, like other sources, 
refused to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kuwait and Washington indicate that Iraq already has massed up to 
100,000 troops near the Kuwaiti border, although diplomats in Baghdad and 
reports from the region put the figure closer to 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
A Western official in Cairo with close ties to the gulf region said that Iraq, 
as recently as a year ago, moved troops to the border in an abortive conflict 
over Kuwaiti plans to build a vacation resort on disputed territory. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the talks reflects the hard bargaining stance that both 
countries have adopted in a dispute worth billions of dollars and involving 
strategic territory, particularly important to an increasingly restive Iraq, 
several analysts and diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're seeing is bargaining over the price of a carpet," one said. "The 
Iraqis today opened up with their price for the carpet. The Kuwaitis refused. 
We know the carpet is eventually going to be bought, but we don't know yet at 
what price." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which benefited from about $30 billion in Kuwaiti largess during Iraq's 
eight-year war with Iran, believes Kuwait should write off the loans and also 
compensate it for $2.4 billion in oil that it claims Kuwait illegally pumped 
from a disputed field along the border. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is also accusing Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of costing Iraq $14 
billion by pumping oil in excess of their quotas assigned by the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the dispute said it is likely that Iraq entered the talks 
Tuesday demanding full compensation plus forgiveness of the loans. Kuwait, they 
said, likely responded that it would be willing to pay some compensation, but 
would consider it as a credit against the war debt Iraq still owes Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is also believed to be unwilling to link the decades-old border dispute 
with the financial discussions, while the Iraqis are insisting on a 
comprehensive settlement, several analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
After an initial two-hour meeting, chief Iraqi delegate Izzat Ibrahim, deputy 
chairman of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council, left Jidda without holding a 
scheduled second round of talks with Kuwait's prime minister, Sheik Saad al 
Abdullah al Sabah. 
</P>
<P>
A Kuwaiti official in Jidda told Reuters news agency that the talks "have 
collapsed because Kuwait did not give in to Iraqi demands to write off the 
(Gulf War) debts and to relinquish some of its territory." 
</P>
<P>
Before departing Saudi Arabia, Saad issued a statement agreeing to Iraqi 
proposals to move the talks to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
But it was clear from the beginning that Iraq did not consider the Jidda 
meeting as a give-and-take bargaining session. 
</P>
<P>
"Without recognizing Iraq's rights and giving them back . . .," the newspaper 
of Iraq's governing Baath party said, "it is not only difficult, but 
impossible, to achieve any progress in the Jidda meeting and settle the 
differences." 
</P>
<P>
Saddam had earlier said he regarded the Jidda meeting as a protocol session to 
be followed up by substantive talks in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who have tried 
to mediate the dispute, are believed to be preparing for another round of 
talks, perhaps a summit-level discussion between the leaders of the two 
countries, in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday approved new 
restrictions on trade with Iraq, while the State Department called in Iraq's 
ambassador to encourage the talks between Baghdad and Kuwait.

The announcement, reported by the government's national news agency AIM, is 
considered a major concession that could help end the nation's 13-year-old 
civil war. "It's a positive step," Manuel Frank, Lisbon representative of the 
Mozambique National Resistance, said in Portugal. But he called for talks,

Thousands poured into the streets of Sofia, the capital, in a spontaneous 
demonstration. The election of Zhelev, 55, ended a four-week deadlock since the 
resignation of Petar Mladenov, a member of the ruling Communist Party, now 
renamed the Socialist Party. Zhelev's elevation, with Socialist support, was 
seen as a commitment to pluralism by the government.

SENATORS WEIGH RULES ON PHONE CALLER ID; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNICATIONS: MARKETERS STRESS ITS DETERRENT EFFECT ON OBSCENE OR HARASSING 
CALLS. CRITICS SEE IT AS A THREAT TO PRIVACY.

<P>
The Senate on Wednesday plunged into the growing controversy over caller ID, 
the new technology that permits a telephone customer to see the number of the 
person calling even before picking up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
The service, which soon will be introduced in Los Angeles and San Francisco, 
has raised new and complex privacy issues. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone companies have marketed the service by stressing its deterrent effect 
on obscene or harassing telephone calls. In one common advertisement, a woman 
is able to frighten an obscene caller by telling him that she knows his 
telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
But in testimony Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary's subcommittee on 
technology and the law, proponents of federal legislation to regulate caller ID 
say that the issues go beyond managing telephone obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
In opening the session, subcommittee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) asked if 
caller ID would "jeopardize the safety of desperate people seeking refuge from 
domestic violence, or inhibit the drug addict or suicidal teen-ager from 
seeking help." 
</P>
<P>
The issues often involve balancing the rights of callers against those of 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
"The competing privacy interests are most often held by the same people," said 
Janlori Goldman, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union in 
Washington. "In fact, when they see themselves as receivers of phone calls, 
most people are eager for caller ID. But, as makers of phone calls, most people 
want the power to block the display of their numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Caller ID is currently offered in New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia and West 
Virginia. But earlier this year a judge in Pennsylvania blocked introduction of 
the service there, saying that caller ID is unconstitutional under state laws 
that ban wiretapping. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell plans to introduce caller ID in California next year, along with 
other services using the same technology. 
</P>
<P>
The federal legislation under consideration by the Senate would permit 
introduction of caller ID only if telephone customers are also given the option 
of blocking the display of their number. Customers who wished to make a call 
without releasing their phone number could dial a code and the recipient would 
only see "P" or "Private" on the caller ID display screen. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to this type of "per-call" blocking, telephone companies also have 
the ability to permanently block the display of a customer's telephone line 
every time they make a call. This is usually referred to as "per-line" 
blocking. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone companies are divided over the issue. When Pacific Bell begins caller 
ID service, the company also will offer "per-call" blocking to all telephone 
customers without charge. John Stangland, Pacific Bell's assistant vice 
president for product development and management, said that the company decided 
that offering caller ID and blocking at the same time "is the most balanced 
alternative for our customers."

B-2 BACKERS URGE WHITE HOUSE TO SAVE EMBATTLED PLANE; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: CRITICS SAY THAT UNLESS BUSH ENTERS THE POLITICAL FRAY SOON, THE 
BOMBER WILL NOT SURVIVE THE UPCOMING HOUSE AND SENATE BUDGET DEBATES.

<P>
As congressional debate on defense spending has shifted into high gear, 
lawmakers who support the embattled B-2 Stealth bomber are complaining that 
White House support for the program has lacked resolve. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bush Administration seems to have been jolted to some degree by a 
committee vote Tuesday to terminate production, some supporters warn that it 
already may be too late to keep the B-2 from crashing during budget battles on 
the House and Senate floors. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the $63-billion program have been pressing the Administration for 
weeks to push its most powerful advocate -- the President -- into the political 
fray in an effort to pluck the program from death at the hands of budget 
cutters. To their mounting frustration, they continue to get what they consider 
a tepid response. 
</P>
<P>
"The White House and the secretary of defense have been dragging their heels on 
explaining the need for the B-2 to the American public," complained Sen. J. 
James Exon (D-Neb.), the Senate's leading proponent of the radar-eluding 
aircraft. "The President had better spend some political capital on this 
aircraft or it could be very, very dead -- and so stealthy that no one will be 
able to see it." 
</P>
<P>
There were some signs of action Wednesday, a day after the House Armed Services 
Committee dealt the B-2 program its most serious blow yet, adopting a 
$283-billion 1991 defense bill that would terminate production of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security 
adviser, began inviting senators to the White House to urge them to support the 
B-2. And White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk suggested that the President will 
boost the foundering program in a speech today, in which Bush "will address how 
he perceives the U.S. defense budget and U.S. force structure in meeting the 
changing demands." 
</P>
<P>
That description of Bush's coming speech, however, failed to comfort critics 
who complain that the White House is dealing with the plane as part of a larger 
package of defense modernization programs. White House sources add that the 
Administration believes it is too early for the President to go to the mat for 
the plane because Congress is at least two months away from completing its 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, as many as 17,000 jobs are at stake. For the Northrop 
Corp., the prime contractor of the beleaguered B-2, the termination of the 
program could bring serious financial trouble, according to industry and 
Pentagon analysts. 
</P>
<P>
With the Senate floor debate due to start as early as today, the House 
committee's vote to kill the B-2 was just the first of many challenges the 
plane will face. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Armed Services Committee in mid-July recommended approval of $4.5 
billion -- the Administration's full request -- to build and test two of the 
bombers. But in a White House meeting last Monday, the bomber's most 
influential Senate advocate, Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), warned 
that without strong White House intercession, he might not be able to fend off 
opponents of the program on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
As debate moves to the floors of the House and Senate, the B-2 program is 
expected to be buffeted by criticism, including some from the Administration's 
Republican allies. 
</P>
<P>
During that process, one knowledgeable source said that Vice President Dan 
Quayle, once a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, might be sent to 
Capitol Hill to whip errant Senate Republicans into line on the B-2. So far, 
however, Quayle remains on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), a staunch B-2 supporter, the Bush 
Administration decided recently that it must focus its efforts on later stages 
of the budget-writing process, including the conference between the House and 
Senate Armed Services committees and the drafting of the defense appropriations 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who are already singing at the B-2's funeral are doing so a little too 
early," warned Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
But several lawmakers, speaking privately, called the White House effort 
faint-hearted, saying that it is likely to be too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has reinforced that impression, they said, by being unwilling to 
single out the B-2 for special treatment. While Cheney has touted the plane in 
speeches and congressional hearings, Pentagon officials said that he has been 
careful not to suggest that the B-2 is a non-negotiable priority in the defense 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to resist the urge to cut side deals on special projects," said a 
senior defense official. "We're still trying to go for an overall budget," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress' final version of the 1991 defense budget leaves out the B-2, will 
Bush use his most powerful weapon -- the legislative veto -- to get the funds 
restored? 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William L. Dickinson (R-Ala.), the ranking Republican on the House Armed 
Services Committee, predicted Wednesday that Bush would veto the House bill if 
it came to him in its current form. But other proponents of the revolutionary 
plane warned that Bush cannot let the situation come to that, because it 
probably won't work. 
</P>
<P>
"You can veto offending provisions out of a bill," said one congressional aide 
who is key to the fight. "But you really can't veto something into a bill." 
</P>
<P>
Some Democratic supporters of the B-2, including Exon, said they suspected that 
behind the White House's muted support lies a more intricate strategy: to let 
Congress kill the bomber program that the Bush Administration itself has 
concluded is too costly, and then accuse the Democrats in future campaigns of 
having abandoned the nation's defenses.

STATE BUDGET CUTS TO HIT HARD IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLAKE FONTENAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sting of Gov. George Deukmejian's budget cuts will be sharply felt in San 
Diego County's health clinics, social service centers, schoolhouses and 
courtrooms, local officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian approved a $55.7-billion state budget Tuesday, but only after 
wielding his blue pencil to cut $753 million from the draft that legislators 
had passed to his office. Officials across San Diego County spent Wednesday 
crunching numbers to determine how much their programs stand to lose. Their 
preliminary findings are not optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
The program that provides health services to about 25,000 indigent adults 
annually may have been hit hardest, according to Manuel Lopez, the county's 
director of financial management. 
</P>
<P>
That program could lose somewhere between $8 million and $14.5 million, 
depending on how state leaders spread out the $175 million cut from the budget 
to treat indigent patients, Norman Hickey, the county's chief administrative 
officer, announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Unless another funding source is found, the program might be dissolved, said 
William Cox, the county's director of health services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be devastating to people who depend on this program," Cox said. 
"It's a travesty against one of the most vulnerable segments of our society." 
</P>
<P>
Cox estimated that the governor's cuts could leave his program with as little 
as $17 million. With that amount, the county could continue to fund treatment 
for some indigent patients at primary-care clinics but would be forced to 
cancel its contracts with private hospitals that provide more-extensive care 
for the poor, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Some money would be left over, Cox said, but the reimbursement to private 
hospitals could amount to as little as 10 cents to 20 cents for every dollar 
that the hospitals spend on indigent care. 
</P>
<P>
Also, health care for the mentally ill may face large reductions, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian cut $61 million from the statewide budget for mental health, but the 
director of the state's Department of Mental Health will make the decision on 
how much individual counties stand to lose, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hickey's estimates, that could mean no cuts -- or it could mean 
cuts as large as $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Cox called the cuts "a disaster in the making." 
</P>
<P>
"They have chopped into the bone of county health care programs." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, judges, court clerks and all of their supporting staff members will 
also have to tighten their belts under the governor's spending plan, according 
to Sandy Smith, a budget analyst for the county. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the trial court system will be reduced about $4.3 million, Smith 
said, adding that rather than getting a 5% increase as a cost-of-living 
adjustment, the system must instead deal with a 10% COLA decrease. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have not determined how that change will affect the system, but Smith 
said it could mean cuts on everything from office supplies to judges' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty hefty cut," Smith said. "I think the euphemism is that 'creative 
thought' is needed to solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN), a program designed to wean people from 
welfare, will lose about $1.8 million of its $20.2-million budget this year, 
said Ray Koenig, the program's director. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cut in GAIN's funding is relatively small, it will mean that the 
program can accept only about half the number of new participants its directors 
hoped to serve, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
GAIN provides services to qualified welfare recipients, including remedial 
education, vocational training and job searches, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
The program ordinarily accepts about 1,000 new participants each month, but 
that number will be halved because of the cuts and a recently adopted federal 
requirement that program administrators provide child care for welfare mothers 
who participate, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
Costs for providing the child care, along with the continuing costs of 
providing services for the program's current 11,000 participants, make reducing 
the number of new participants unavoidable, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators were also feeling the pinch Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Because the cuts eliminated some special incentives, fewer school districts are 
likely to begin operating on a year-round schedule, which would involve 
rotating staff members and students to ease crowding, said Charles Ballinger, 
the county's coordinator of year-round education. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian reduced the amount of special incentives a school district can 
receive, making the year-round format a less attractive alternative, Ballinger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the city and county school superintendents were mourning the loss of 
funding for the California Assessment Program, a widely acclaimed procedure for 
measuring students' achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a $27-billion operation," Tom Boysen, the superintendent for county 
schools, said of the statewide system. "We were spending $12 million for 
quality control (the CAP). And that just got cut."

GRUMBLING GREETS PROHIBITION ON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Prohibition came to San Diego beaches Wednesday, a day so warm and sun-kissed 
that by noon beach-goers were already thinking of ways to beat the alcohol ban. 
</P>
<P>
Suggestions included disguising the beer in paper cups, plastic jugs and 
beverage insulators, even staging a surfers' keg party offshore. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, man, I think we'll get a pontoon and anchor it a few yards offshore and 
party on the water," said surfer Miley Alaniz. "That's not the beach, so they 
can't stop us from having a beer there." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council in June imposed the six-month alcohol ban at La Jolla Shores 
Beach, next to Kellogg Beach and North Park Community Park, to determine if 
alcohol is linked to crime and drunkenness at public beaches and parks. 
</P>
<P>
The trial ban lasts until Feb. 1. Signs have been posted along the beachfront 
and in the parks; additional signs will be posted. The police beach team will 
be patrolling the shores as usual, but no additional officers will be assigned 
to the area. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has some of the few beaches in Southern California where drinking 
alcohol is legal, but restrictions have been imposed gradually in public parks 
as drunkenness and alcohol-related crime have escalated. Drinking is prohibited 
from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. at beaches north of the Mission Bay channel entrance. 
</P>
<P>
The trial ban has generated controversy among beach-goers, beach community 
residents and City Council members. All sides seem to agree that the 
alcohol-related problems are caused by a small percentage of drinkers and 
teen-agers who hang out at the beach parking lots after dark. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching a solution, however, has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The city outlawed drinking in its beach parking lots in 1987 and last year 
ordered that parking lots at South Mission Beach be closed at 10 p.m. in a move 
to curtail alcohol-related problems there. 
</P>
<P>
The six-month ban was adopted after the council reversed a decision in December 
to adopt a citywide ban of alcohol at public beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Hartley, who has voiced support for a citywide beach ban, said 
he still wants alcohol banned from all public beaches but understands the need 
for the public to be heard before such a decision is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"Drinking on the beach is a privilege, not a right, and it often leads to 
rowdiness and obnoxious behavior," Hartley said. "Most major counties in 
Southern California already ban alcohol on the beaches, and San Diego has to 
take appropriate measures to protect itself from this type of behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor remains opposed to the ban and, instead, favors 
increased enforcement of existing laws against public drunkenness, urination 
and unruly behavior to combat problems on the beach, said her press secretary, 
Paul Downey. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor feels that most people who have beer at a family picnic or some wine 
while they watch the sunset are responsible drinkers, and that it's not fair to 
punish the law-abiding citizens," Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
For the next two weeks, police will issue verbal and written warnings to 
violators before police begin enforcing the ban with $25 and $50 citations. All 
alcoholic beverages will be dumped out or confiscated. Police are empowered to 
search coolers if circumstances warrant it, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego lifeguards also will issue warnings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the word is out -- we haven't been seeing as much beer on the beach 
lately, and people have been asking us about the ban," said lifeguard Jay 
Hilton. "We'll keep our eyes open and answer questions, but we'll leave the 
ticketing to the police." 
</P>
<P>
Once ticketing begins, tourists and others who claim ignorance of the law might 
still escape with a warning, but repeat offenders will be cited until they get 
the message, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two weeks will be an informational and educational process where 
officers will warn people and explain the rules," said Sgt. Rick O'Hanlon of 
the San Diego police's beach team. 
</P>
<P>
On the ban's first day, police and lifeguards issued some warnings and dumped 
out a few cans of beer, but most beach-goers seemed aware of the ban, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have already seen some tapering off in the number of people getting drunk 
in these areas," O'Hanlon said. "We think people are getting the message." 
</P>
<P>
Few people at the beach Wednesday, however, were pleased even with the trial 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
"It stinks," said surfer Alaniz of Pacific Beach. "The surfers come back from 
the water and like to have a beer or two. Why should everybody get screwed 
because a few people cause all the problems?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's a political move," added surfer Dave Garcia of La Jolla Shores, saying 
"big-bucks" La Jolla Shores residents got the measure approved over the 
sentiments of the majority. "We're going to fight this" in February, he said, 
when the council will review the ban and vote on whether to make it permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Added surfer Donnie Iverson of La Jolla Shores: "And this ban is going to ruin 
it for the local stores that sell beer and wine and the aluminum can 
collectors. The whole thing is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the La Jolla Shores Assn., a local residents organization, 
disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We favor a permanent ban for all the city's beaches," said Sue Oxley. "Many 
people start drinking in the afternoon, and by dark they are a menace on the 
beach and the road." 
</P>
<P>
"It's out of control," said Carl Dustin Jr., a La Jolla Shores native who said 
he moved to Encinitas to escape the beach problems. "Loud parties, broken 
glass, fights, stabbings, rapes. It's ruined the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Beach patrol officers said they expect no major problem until the weekend, when 
the large crowds arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a small isolated beach so it's a good test area," said officer Sandy 
Scharnberg. "During the week, the crowds are not that big, mostly families and 
tourists. But the weekends are usually when the problems occur." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be very polite in reminding people of the ban, but the law is 
the law," said her partner, officer Ken Brown. "It's a shame that 5% of the 
drinkers have to ruin it for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Many beach-goers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It sucks," said Jon Jaggard of San Diego as he lugged his beach chair along 
the boardwalk. "It infringes on our rights. The next step is banning alcohol at 
tailgate parties at the stadium. This is just the tip of the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
The trial ban has an exemption allowing groups to obtain a city permit to drink 
alcohol.

OFFICER RESIGNS OVER ILLEGAL USE OF LICENSE TAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran Ventura police detective and community college instructor has 
resigned from the force after pleading no contest to illegally displaying on 
his 1965 Cadillac a license tag that was stripped from an abandoned automobile, 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Ronald L. Wyatt, 45, was sentenced to one year's probation and fined 
$210 by Municipal Court Judge Herbert Curtis III, who on May 23 found Wyatt 
guilty of a misdemeanor involving personal use of a license stick-on tag that 
had been assigned to another vehicle, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
A 1990 license for the 25-year-old Cadillac, which Wyatt told investigators he 
was buying from a friend, would have cost about $30, a spokeswoman for the 
state Department of Motor Vehicles said. 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt, of Moorpark, could not be reached for comment. His attorney, Charles 
Goldwasser, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Pat Rooney, spokesman for the Ventura Police Department, would not discuss 
the case except to confirm that Wyatt had resigned recently after about 20 
years on the force. 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt, a former narcotics officer, was assigned to general investigations at 
the time of his resignation, according to the department. 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt has also taught criminal justice courses at Ventura College for several 
years, including two classes -- Introduction to Criminal Justice and 
Fundamentals of Law Enforcement -- this past spring, the college confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department became aware of the illegal tag on Wyatt's car on April 
16, nearly one month after he left the vehicle in the department's parking lot, 
according to police investigative reports on file with the Municipal Court. 
Another officer assumed that the car had been abandoned and began an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt promptly moved the vehicle from the parking lot. When it was seized as 
evidence the next day, the sticker had been removed, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with police Sgt. Bob Anderson, Wyatt twice denied that he had 
placed the illegal tag on his car, Anderson reported. 
</P>
<P>
But Wyatt acknowledged that he was familiar with the abandoned vehicle from 
which the tag had been taken, saying the vehicle was kept at a Santa Paula 
storage yard operated by a friend from whom Wyatt had arranged to buy the 
Cadillac, the report said. Wyatt also acknowledged knowing the combination to 
the lock at the storage yard. 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt reportedly said he believed that the 1990 sticker on his Cadillac was one 
of several he had checked out from the Police Department. It is common 
department practice for officers on undercover and other special details to 
check out tags from seized vehicles to cover the law-enforcement plates and 
tags on their automobiles, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The department forwarded the results of its criminal investigation to the 
district attorney in late April, and Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim Gibbons filed the 
misdemeanor count May 15, records show. Eight days later Wyatt entered his 
no-contest plea.

DRIVERS GIVE PUMPED-UP GAS PRICES MIXED REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County motorists had mixed reactions to increased gasoline prices 
Wednesday, but many expressed hope that it will be cheaper to spend more money 
for gasoline if promised repairs to the county's rutty roads cut down on their 
wheel realignment and new tire bills. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know where the potholes are?" asked Santa Paula resident Norm 
Fournier, who travels among the Western states promoting a water conservation 
product. "I've got them marked from here to Oregon." 
</P>
<P>
"You want to see why we need a road tax? Just try to get to Fillmore," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The tax increase, approved by voters as Proposition 111, was designed by the 
state to help finance a 10-year $18.5-billion transportation program to help 
relieve traffic congestion and repair crumbling roadways. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Ventura County could receive more than $200 million during 
the next 10 years for roadway projects that include linking the Simi Valley and 
Moorpark freeways, widening the Saticoy Bridge and widening California 126 from 
Fillmore to the Los Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
California 118 from Moorpark to Oxnard and the Ventura Freeway between Seacliff 
and the Santa Barbara County line also would be widened. The county will 
receive about $20 million a year for new construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
Approval sparked a 9-cent-per-gallon hike in gas taxes. Five cents of the 
increase went into effect Wednesday with the other 4 cents to be phased in 
during the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
An extra few nickels is "cheaper than buying new tires," said Fournier's 
business partner Jim Balding, who was pumping gas into his car at a self-serve 
Shell station in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
A few frustrated drivers said they wished the money could come from someone 
else's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we need the roads fixed. No, I don't want to pay for it," said Tim Lewis, 
a Ventura resident and professional clown refueling his van in a clown suit 
Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Several station owners and managers across the county said business at the 
pumps increased more than 20% on Monday and Tuesday as people tried to get in 
their last tank of gas before the price change. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time gas goes up people think station owners are building another 
swimming pool or something," said Alan Dikes, whose family has operated a 
Chevron station in Ventura for 22 years. "A lot of them are coming up and 
saying 'What in the hell happened to the prices?' " 
</P>
<P>
Since the gas shortages of the 1970s, motorists have feared prices soaring 
above $2 so "people always think it could be worse," Dikes said. Once reminded 
of the voter referendum they simmer down, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Some county residents said that as a result of the gas hike, prices may also be 
increased by businesses that depend on gas guzzling cars to provide services. 
</P>
<P>
David Wagner, who uses two pickup trucks to run his Camarillo landscaping 
business, said the price hike will cost him at least an extra $25 each week, an 
extra $25 he will be forced to charge his customers. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll get passed on down to everybody. I can't afford to soak it up," Wagner 
said.

WRIGHT-BRALY RACE COSTLIEST IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and GOP challenger Hunt Braly spent 
more than $672,000 in their bitter June primary election battle, making it by 
far the most expensive state legislative race in Ventura County, according to 
final campaign reports. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates wound up in debt after the June 5 election, which Wright won by 
a 3-2 margin, said final reports released this week. 
</P>
<P>
Wright reported owing nearly $23,000. Braly owes more than $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign reports said Wright, who faces only a token Democratic challenger this 
fall in the 37th Assembly District, spent $425,000 during the 12 months before 
the primary. Braly, chief aide to state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), spent 
$247,000. 
</P>
<P>
The race was the toughest Wright, 61, has faced since her 1980 election to the 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Braly, 35, attacked her repeatedly for trying to intervene with law enforcement 
authorities on behalf of her daughter Victoria, who received 28 traffic tickets 
over a seven-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Braly said virtually all of his debt is money he personally lent his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
He made the loan, he said, with "the full expectation that, if I didn't win, 
I'd never see that money again." He said that, unlike many candidates, he plans 
no fund-raisers to retire the debt. JACK CHEEVERS

PUBLIC HEALTH GROUP RECEIVES $38,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County immunization program for infants and children will get 
$38,000 in state funds, the Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The allocation is $1,000 more than Public Health Services received last year, 
but still is not nearly enough, said Carol McSorley, supervising public health 
nurse. 
</P>
<P>
"We're grateful for what we do get, but it barely even covers the salaries," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The county has documented 25 measles cases so far this year, more than double 
the 12 cases in all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The measles epidemic in the state and the county is a big problem. . . . It's 
a disgrace to public health in this day and age, since it is a preventable 
disease," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The state also supplies $300,000 worth of vaccine, and the county contributes 
money from the general health fund. 
</P>
<P>
The county's goal is to immunize 98% of children entering kindergarten and 95% 
of infants and preschool students.

COUNTY PARES SMOG FEES FOR RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oak View restaurant developer won half his battle against paying $27,965 in 
smog fees Wednesday when the county slashed the required fee by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
Over objections from the city of Ojai, the county's Environmental Report Review 
Committee approved an environmental document for John Cuccia's application to 
build a spaghetti restaurant in Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
The revised document requires him to pay $12,082 to offset air pollution 
emissions from the restaurant's traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia, owner of Vince's Spaghetti House Inc. with restaurants in Ventura and 
Oxnard, had called the fee ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still pretty high," said Cuccia's architect, LeRoy Andrews. "I guess 
we'll have to accept it, momentarily, until I talk with my client," he told the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is the first development to run up against tightened air quality 
regulations for Ojai Valley that took effect Jan. 1. The fees will be used for 
programs to reduce traffic along California 33. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai Planning Director William Prince asked the panel to delay its decision on 
the environmental document until the city could review the recommended measures 
to offset pollution. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was not clear what benefit the measures will provide. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Thomas, county air quality specialist, said the Air Pollution Control 
District reduced the fee after learning that the 7,984-square-foot restaurant 
will be closed on Wednesdays and will average one delivery truck per day. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Barnett, chief engineer of the Casitas Municipal Water District, 
cautioned the panel that the water company has not promised water service to 
the restaurant. Under the company's current moratorium on new hookups, Barnett 
said it will be at least a year before the restaurant could be guaranteed water 
service. THIA BELL

CONSERVANCY, COUNTY TO SIGN PARK PACT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and Ventura County are scheduled to sign 
an agreement today that will allow the opening of the 3,700-acre Happy Camp 
Canyon Regional Park near Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would form the Eastern Ventura County Conservation Authority, 
which will operate the county-owned park beginning Aug. 30, a conservancy 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is scheduled to be signed at 3 p.m. at the East Valley Sheriff's 
Station in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The mountainous park, which is known for its horse trails, was obtained by the 
county in a land swap with the state in the late 1970s, said Rorie Skei, 
program manager of the state Mountain Recreation and Conservation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Because of budget restraints, the county never developed or operated the land 
as a park, she said. The county kept the land closed to visitors because it 
could not afford the liability of operating a major regional park, Skei said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the state, which oversees the conservancy, would take over 
liability and operation of the park, Skei said. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the park was delayed for several months by a debate over the 
park's entrance. The conservancy pushed for access off Broadway, an east-west 
road that intersects the land midway through the bottom 700 acres. 
</P>
<P>
But representatives of Quor Inc. of Encino, which has an option to build on 
part of the parkland, wanted hikers and horseback riders to enter farther 
north, off Happy Camp Road, so they would not interfere with future 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The county, which has final say, decided on the Broadway entrance. HUGO MARTIN

LAWNDALE COUNCIL TO VOTE ON TAX MEASURE; 
</P>
<P>
REVENUES: COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE DIVIDED ON PUTTING PROPOSED 2% LEVY ON UTILITIES 
ON NOVEMBER BALLOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A proposed ballot measure that would impose a 2% tax on water, gas, 
electricity, cable and telephone services for Lawndale residents and businesses 
will be taken up tonight by a divided City Council. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, scheduled to begin at 7 p.m., the council is also to vote on a 
no-growth budget that projects shrinking revenues. Noting this, Mayor Harold 
Hofmann and Councilman Larry Rudolph have said they would support the tax 
proposal as a way to raise revenues for the tightly squeezed city. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Carol Norman has vowed to vote against placing the measure on 
the ballot, and Councilman William Johnson said he is unlikely to support it 
unless the entire council is in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way it will fly is if every one of us wants it," Johnson said. 
"Without the entire council consensus that they want that to go, I don't think 
the voters are going to support it." 
</P>
<P>
Because there is a vacant council seat, a 2-2 vote would prevent the measure 
from appearing on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the proposed utility tax say Lawndale is the only city in the 
South Bay that does not tax its residents and businesses on at least some 
utilities. In addition, they say, the proposed rate of 2% is smaller than that 
charged by any other neighboring city. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the point right now where our revenues from every source -- the 
county, the state, the (federal government) -- are cut back," Rudolph said in 
an interview this week. "I feel we ought to put it (the proposal) before the 
voters and let them decide." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the measure, which needs a simple majority of votes to pass, 
say Lawndale prides itself on being a city with low taxes and that a utility 
tax should be considered only as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a regressive tax," Norman said. "To some people, $5 is nothing. But to 
others, it means almost a week of groceries. . . . There are other ways to 
address our problems: restructuring business licenses, adding some fees for 
things that have been free for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The tax, she said, "is a lazy way out." 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale's finance director, Judith Longman, said that the tiny, blue-collar 
city of 27,000 residents desperately needs the $240,000 a year that the tax 
would be expected to generate. 
</P>
<P>
"Most cities do have a utility users tax," she said. "It's very unusual not to 
have one at all. If the city is going to continue to maintain service levels as 
it has in the past, new sources of revenue are absolutely essential." 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the voters, the measure would go into effect Jan. 1. Revenues 
from the tax would be unrestricted and would go into the general fund to pay 
any of the city's expenses. Because it is a general tax not earmarked for any 
particular service, it only needs the approval of a simple majority of voters, 
rather than two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
A homeowner who pays $100 a month for all his utilities would pay $2 more under 
the proposed measure, Longman said. Although businesses would be charged at the 
same rate, they would probably end up paying more because their utility bills 
tend to be higher, she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a survey published last month by the California Municipal Business 
Tax Assn., Lawndale's proposed tax rate is "very modest" compared to that of 
any neighboring city, Longman said. Lawndale's proposed tax, however, would 
cover more utilities than some of the taxes imposed by other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of neighboring Hawthorne, for instance, are taxed 3.5% on their 
electricity, gas and telephone services, though not on their water and cable 
services, Longman said. Gardena residents pay a 4% tax on their electric, gas 
and telephone services, though not on their water and cable. Redondo Beach 
charges its residents a 4.7% tax on all their utilities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although each of those cities exempts senior citizens from the tax, and two of 
them exempt low-income residents, Lawndale's proposed measure would make no 
special provisions for its elderly or low-income residents, Longman said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we exempted senior citizens and low-income residents, we would exempt 
practically all the residents in town," Longman said. "This is not a young 
city." 
</P>
<P>
But Lawndale resident and community activist Nancy Marthens said the lack of an 
exemption for seniors is just one more reason she plans to campaign against the 
tax if it is placed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a last-minute (proposal) carelessly thrown together to try to 
defray budget deficiencies," Marthens said. "Most of us are already being taxed 
to the limit, as things currently stand. . . . I don't want to see (the tax) 
become a vehicle to take care of deficient budgets in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Paley, former president of the Lawndale Chamber of Commerce, agreed that 
seniors should be exempted from the tax. But, he said, he believes the tax is 
fair because the city has been relying too much on business revenue to pay for 
its operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they really need to generate some funds for the city, and that's 
probably one of the better ways to do it," Paley said.

L.A. DROPS PLANS TO DESIGNATE HEINZ CANNERY A HISTORIC SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has scrapped plans to designate one of the port's 
oldest canneries a historical monument, deciding instead that a new museum or 
plaza should launch waterfront development in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-0 decision, urged by Harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, clears 
the way for razing Wilmington's old Heinz pet food cannery, a once-bustling 
facility that traces its history to a one-story shed built in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action also puts the city and Harbor Department on record 
supporting the concept of a new commercial endeavor along Wilmington's 
waterfront, which for years has been overlooked by the port in favor of seaside 
development in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Just how the council and port will bring new commerce to Wilmington, however, 
remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to trust them," said Wilmington's Gertrude Schwab, a member of a 
port advisory board on seaside development. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the cannery, at 545 S. Fries Ave., began to draw wide interest last 
year when Heinz announced it would close the two-acre facility, allowing the 
port to add the property to its vast construction and maintenance yard. 
</P>
<P>
With the community clamoring for some waterfront development and the cannery 
awaiting demolition, Flores last August moved to designate the facility a city 
historic monument. The designation, later approved by the city's Cultural 
Heritage Commission, was aimed at prodding the port into saving the cannery 
long enough to see if it should become a part of a long-proposed waterfront 
development in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
After reports indicated that restoring the old, asbestos-filled cannery would 
be costly and cumbersome, Flores, port officials and community representatives 
continued to study the possibility of waterfront development in Wilmington. In 
January, RTKL Associates Inc., a Baltimore-based consulting firm whose projects 
include the successful Baltimore Place, outlined several proposals for 
Wilmington, among them an $11-million development of offices, restaurants and 
shops along Fries Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action Tuesday does not ensure that those specific proposals will 
move forward, but does include the port's pledge that a commercial development 
will result from the wrangling over the cannery. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have a consensus in developing a seed project that will have some 
historical components and some recognition of the port, the community and the 
canning industry," the port's Dwayne Lee, deputy executive director of 
development, said after the council's action. 
</P>
<P>
But Lee cautioned that the details of the project -- its location, scope, 
start-up date and cost -- have yet to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to call it more than a concept at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's remarks are at odds with Flores' spirited description Tuesday of what 
awaits the Wilmington waterfront now that the fate of the cannery has been 
decided. Indeed, during a brief council discussion, Flores spoke of a port 
history museum, with simulated cranes and other equipment, as well as a 
waterfront plaza -- similar to one in Alexandria, Va. -- for artists and their 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are a couple of the things we are considering," Flores told her 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Flores said the council's action would ensure that the cannery's most 
important legacy -- its equipment -- would remain in the port. 
</P>
<P>
"The part about the cannery that's going to be preserved is really the 
important part . . . and that is to actually go in and see the cans moving 
overhead into the sterilizing, the labeling," Flores said. "And all of the 
things that have such an intricate history tied with up with that community 
will be preserved, will be in a building," she said. 
</P>
<P>
How that will be accomplished also remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Since the cannery's closure, most of its conveyors and other equipment have 
been removed, according to members of the Wilmington advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
"The big stuff is gone," said Schwab, who toured the facility recently with 
other committee members. The committee has collected some smaller historical 
items, such as scales and desks, from the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Heinz officials could not be reached for comment, but Schwab said she 
understands much of the heavy equipment has been sold to a cannery in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, she and other Wilmington advisory committee members endorsed the 
council's action, figuring it at least focuses new attention on their dream of 
a waterfront occupied by restaurants and shops, not warehouses and construction 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad to see this (cannery) go," Schwab said. "However, I'm against 
preserving this structure" at the risk of losing the port's support for a 
commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Added committee Chairman George De La Torre: "This moves us in the direction we 
want to go . . . but we still have to get the project off the ground."

D.A. INVESTIGATES OXNARD COUNCIL SESSION AS POSSIBLE ILLEGAL MEETING; 
</P>
<P>
BROWN ACT: THE PANEL MAY HAVE VIOLATED STATE STATUTES WHEN IT MET BEHIND CLOSED 
DOORS TO MODIFY AN AGREEMENT WITH A DEVELOPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Ventura County district attorney's office is investigating whether the 
Oxnard City Council violated state open meeting laws when it met in closed 
session last month to modify a development agreement adopted in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Coleman, special assistant district attorney, said Tuesday that he is 
reviewing city records to determine whether the council violated state law when 
it met behind closed doors to modify an agreement made with the IDM Corp. of 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The development agreement to sell IDM a three-acre lot and permit the firm to 
build a 100-unit senior citizens apartment complex at Bard and Saviers roads 
was made in a public session in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said the council, however, might have violated a state open meeting law 
-- the 1953 Ralph M. Brown Act -- by modifying the development agreement in a 
closed session. If such a violation took place, Coleman said the council can 
resolve the matter by meeting in public session to announce the agreement made 
in closed session. 
</P>
<P>
"Assuming a violation, it would be relatively easy to resolve the matter," 
Coleman said, adding that city officials have been cooperative in providing him 
with information. 
</P>
<P>
The Brown Act requires all government bodies to discuss and decide public 
matters before the public. It has several exceptions, however, including the 
discussion of personnel matters and litigation involving the city. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig said the council did not violate the law. He said 
he told the council that it could meet in closed session because the IDM 
development agreement had become a matter of potential litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Gillig said he may consider advising the council to hold a public meeting on 
the matter if the district attorney determines that a violation took place. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a "mutual mistake" in the development agreement, the city mistakenly 
undercharged the firm $246,297 in development fees, according to a city memo 
dated July 27. 
</P>
<P>
The city had originally asked IDM for $225,253 in fees, said the memo from 
Acting City Manager John Tooker to the City Council. After a routine review of 
the agreement, city officials later determined that IDM should have been 
charged $471,550, Tooker said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Tooker said the mistake was made when IDM officials miscalculated building 
dimensions that are used to calculate fees. He said the mistake was not 
identified until after the City Council approved a development agreement with 
IDM. 
</P>
<P>
After the error was identified, Gillig said representatives of IDM refused to 
pay the additional $246,297 in fees. He said he then instructed the council to 
meet in a closed-door session two weeks ago to discuss how to resolve the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided to ask IDM to pay an additional $209,000 in fees and to 
forgo the remaining $37,297 to settle the matter, Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
The council also agreed in the private session to several modifications of the 
development agreement, including the removal of a provision that requires the 
firm to include trash compactors in the apartments, according to Tooker's memo. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted to secure bond financing for the project with the 
provision that IDM include in the apartment complex 20 low-income units for 
residents age 55 years and older, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The memo also said the modification agreement allows IDM to substitute 26 of 
the 100 garages in the project for carports, which are generally less expensive 
than garages. 
</P>
<P>
Gillig said IDM has approved the modification agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The council had voted in July, 1988, to sell IDM a three-acre lot for $950,000. 
IDM had agreed to build 88 one-bedroom units and 12 two-bedroom units. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Manuel Lopez said he was not aware of the district attorney's 
investigation but does not believe that the council violated the Brown Act. He 
said the closed session was necessary so IDM officials could not determine how 
much the city was willing to charge IDM to settle the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, we are not playing open hand poker here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the Oxnard City Council has been suspected of 
violating the Brown Act. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Ventura County grand jury report said the council violated the 
Brown Act by holding five or six private meetings in September and October, 
1989. The grand jury, however, decided not to indict the council members 
because it said there was insufficient evidence to find that the council was 
aware of a violation. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the council violated the open meeting law when it met in closed 
sessions purportedly to discuss personnel matters. Instead, the council 
discussed and took action on a budget-reduction package, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillig later denied that the private sessions were violations of the Brown Act, 
saying he simply interprets the law differently than the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman has said his office has documented at least three other occasions since 
1988 when the Oxnard City Council has allegedly violated the law by meeting in 
closed sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had more investigations concerning the Brown Act in Oxnard than any 
other agency in the county in the last five years," he said.

2 NORTHRIDGE TEEN-AGERS HELD IN PACOIMA PASTOR'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two teen-agers have been arrested in the shooting death of a Pacoima pastor who 
was gunned down in his Chatsworth house during a dispute over a minor traffic 
accident, Los Angeles police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dana L. Singer, 18, and Philip J. Dimenno, 19, both of Northridge, were 
arrested on suspicion of murder Tuesday, two days after the body of Carl White, 
54, was found on the floor of his house in the 20100 block of Citronia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
White was pastor of the Apostolic Temple Church, a storefront church with a 
handful of members that is located on Van Nuys Boulevard. White was also a 
house painter and a driver for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Michael Brandt said investigators found recent damage to the rear of 
White's car, which was parked at his house, and learned from other undisclosed 
evidence that he had been in a minor traffic accident Friday night. Further 
investigation of the accident led to the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all based on a minor traffic accident," Brandt said. "It's the craziest 
thing. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason to it." 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said White had been driving home about 11 p.m. Friday when he slowed his 
car at Winnetka Avenue and Superior Street, about a block from his house, 
because a fatal accident in the intersection had clogged traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Behind White's car, Dimenno and an unidentified friend were riding in the 
suspect's Mustang, Brandt said. The friend, who was driving the Mustang, was 
distracted by the accident scene and rear-ended White's car. 
</P>
<P>
Because damage to both cars was minor, no police report was taken and the two 
car owners exchanged information from their driver's licenses. But Dimenno's 
car was uninsured, meaning that he could be charged with illegally operating 
the car and be sued by White's insurance company if the pastor reported the 
accident, Lt. L.A. Durrer said. 
</P>
<P>
About 6 a.m. Saturday, Dimenno and Singer -- who had not been in the Mustang at 
the time of the accident -- allegedly went to White's home in an attempt to 
persuade him not to report the accident to his insurance company, Durrer said. 
</P>
<P>
White's wife, Margaret, was visiting relatives in Canada at the time and the 
only other person at home was an elderly relative who was bedridden and did not 
see or hear what took place when the two men visited. 
</P>
<P>
"The two suspects just showed up at the house," Brandt said. "We believe it 
started out as a talking situation. They didn't want Pastor White to notify his 
insurance company about the accident. The situation deteriorated and Pastor 
White was shot and killed." 
</P>
<P>
The suspects fled after the shooting. White's body was not discovered until the 
following night when members of the Apostolic Temple Church became concerned 
after he did not appear for Sunday services and went to his house. The 
bedridden relative was found unharmed in her room. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said it was unknown if the suspects had offered to pay for the damage to 
White's car or simply demanded that White not notify the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Singer was allegedly the man who brought the gun with him and shot 
White. The gun was seized after the suspects were arrested when police watched 
them enter a store in the 6900 block of Reseda Boulevard. Police declined to 
say where the gun was found. 
</P>
<P>
Police said both suspects lived with their parents but declined to reveal other 
details about them or whether they had previous criminal records. Both 
teen-agers were being held without bail and are expected to be arraigned on 
murder charges today in San Fernando Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret White, who returned home from her trip Sunday night as police were 
investigating her husband's death, said funeral services had not yet been 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The Whites, who were well-liked by neighbors, put their home of five years up 
for sale last month and had planned to move back to Kentucky, where White was 
born, said a real estate agent who was handling the listing.

DISPUTE OVER CITY COUNCIL REDISTRICTING REMAINS IN A STANDOFF; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: A FEDERAL MAGISTRATE'S EFFORT TO PROMOTE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN 2 CAMPS 
PROMPTS LITTLE MOVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal magistrate continued Wednesday to prod the two sides in San Diego's 
redistricting battle toward a possible compromise, while plans for further 
hearings on the volatile subject advanced on other fronts. 
</P>
<P>
Repeating what has become a familiar story line, there were developments -- 
though little substantive progress -- both in federal court and at City Hall 
Wednesday concerning the protracted political-legal dispute over the plan to 
redraw council district boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
At a 90-minute closed session in his chambers, U.S. Magistrate Harry McCue met 
with eight lawyers involved in the case in an attempt to focus their clients' 
debate and to search for common ground to avoid a costly, lengthy legal 
showdown. 
</P>
<P>
But, with the two sides being badly divided on several crucial points -- 
notably, whether the City Council has violated a previous legal agreement in 
its handling of the redistricting decision -- at least one city attorney 
characterized McCue's persistent efforts as well-intentioned but fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
"He tried to find a common thread running through everyone's thinking, but 
there just isn't one," said Jack Katz, a senior chief deputy city attorney. 
"When our position is that there hasn't been a breach of the settlement but the 
other side says there has been, it's difficult to find any common ground." 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to narrow the expanding debate, McCue instructed attorneys for the 
Chicano Federation of San Diego County, who vehemently oppose a redistricting 
plan tentatively approved by the council last month, to prepare a written 
summary of what they see as the central legal questions in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Though McCue set no specific dates for future hearings, that synopsis, expected 
to be prepared within several days, presumably will set the stage for 
additional negotiations in a case that has careened between City Hall and 
courtrooms for the past month. 
</P>
<P>
As he has from the start, Chicano Federation attorney Michael Aguirre 
reiterated after Wednesday's meeting that the essential legal question is 
whether the redistricting plan approved in concept by a 5-4 council vote 
significantly dilutes minority voting rights from that of an alternative map 
proposed by a council-appointed citizens' advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed by Councilman John Hartley, the plan tentatively passed by the council 
would reduce the Latino population in the 8th District from the advisory 
board's proposed 52.2% to 51% -- a numerically minor but politically 
significant reduction, according to Aguirre. 
</P>
<P>
In changing the advisory panel's plan, Hartley's proposal would eliminate 
nearly 2,000 blacks and 600 Latinos from the 8th District while adding roughly 
2,500 white voters, Aguirre said. Terming that change "outcome determinative," 
Aguirre argues that the revised composition of the 8th District would 
significantly lessen the chances of a Latino candidate winning there -- 
particularly given Latino voters' traditionally lower turnout. 
</P>
<P>
However, 8th District Councilman Bob Filner and other supporters of Hartley's 
map contend that the impact of that numerical reduction would be offset in part 
by the plan's retention of Balboa Park and downtown in the district -- areas 
that would be removed under the advisory board's proposal. Hartley's plan, they 
argue, not only maintains a Latino-majority district, but also would make the 
district more politically potent, thereby maximizing Latino clout. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's discussion, Aguirre repeated his rejection of that argument. 
</P>
<P>
"They're telling us they're going to give us more by giving us less," Aguirre 
said. "But the price tag for more political clout . . . is a change that makes 
it less likely for Latino voters' choice to be elected. Basically, we just 
don't trust them anymore. We'd rather take our chances with the advisory board 
map." 
</P>
<P>
The advisory board was an outgrowth of the Chicano Federation's 1988 lawsuit 
challenging the constitutionality of the city's electoral system. Under an 
agreement that settled the first phase of that suit, the council agreed to 
establish an advisory board to assist it with its decennial redistricting task. 
</P>
<P>
By rejecting the advisory board's map in favor of Hartley's plan, which was 
publicized only hours before its approval, the council violated both the spirit 
and the letter of the settlement agreement, Aguirre contends. As a result, 
Aguirre has asked the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to impose the advisory 
board's map on the city, arguing that doing so is necessary to protect 
minorities' voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
Describing that interpretation as premature at best, city attorneys -- as well 
as private lawyers who have been hired by some individual council members -- 
emphasize that the council has not yet taken definitive action on 
redistricting. Until a plan is formally approved, its impact on Latinos' voting 
rights and adherence to -- or violation of -- last year's settlement agreement 
cannot be determined, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the continued, largely repetitive legal maneuvering, city officials also 
announced Wednesday that the advisory board will be reconvened next Monday 
night to give it an opportunity to review the proposed changes to its 
redistricting plan. The scheduling of that hearing came in response to a 
council vote Tuesday asking the panel, which officially completed its work in 
June when it forwarded its proposal to the council, to reassemble once more to 
comment on proposed amendments to Hartley's plan and its own map. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly for a case in which legalities often blur political realities, 
next Monday's planned meeting is seen as both politically and legally 
problematical by at least some board members -- creating the prospect of a 
partial boycott. 
</P>
<P>
With the city attorney's office defending the council majority -- and, by 
extension, the Hartley plan -- several board members question whether city 
attorneys can continue to advise the board. Given the case's litigious history, 
board members said Wednesday they would be reluctant to get reinvolved until 
that matter is clarified. 
</P>
<P>
Some board members also; said they are skeptical about why they have been asked 
to give their advice again in light of the council's rejection of their 
original proposal. 
</P>

"What I wonder is whether this is an attempt to use the board to try to 
legitimize the Hartley plan," said board member Dan Greenblat. "Under the 
circumstances, you'd have to be a little suspicious."

SAN PEDRO ZONE CHANGE MAY PUSH SCRAP YARD OUT; 
</P>
<P>
LAND USE: THE CHANGES ADDRESS NORTH GAFFEY STREET NEIGHBORS' PROBLEMS WITH A 
SCRAP METAL YARD. BUT NEARBY OIL TANK FARMS APPARENTLY WILL STAY.

<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has approved rezoning of about 150 acres along 
North Gaffey Street in San Pedro to limit or phase out heavy industry, an 
action that officials believe will lead to the relocation of a disputed scrap 
metal storage yard that abuts the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous vote Tuesday brings to an end a five-year struggle by San Pedro 
homeowner groups and Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores to restrict 
operations at the Hiuka America Corp. scrap yard, which ships about 500,000 
tons of scrap through the Port of Los Angeles each year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new zoning, the 14-acre scrap yard will be allowed to remain open but 
will be declared a "nonconforming use," meaning it will be barred from 
expanding. 
</P>
<P>
The new designation will also make it easier for city officials to declare the 
operation a public nuisance, based on noise or health and safety complaints. 
The city would then have the authority to shut the scrap yard after holding a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very much a victory for the community," Flores said. "In the very worst 
scenario, if the scrap yard stays there for a long time, they know they are 
going to have to be very diligent about being concerned for the community. If 
they aren't, they'll be slapped with the nuisance" declaration. 
</P>
<P>
After objecting to the rezoning effort for years, Hiuka officials in the end 
did not fight it. No one from Hiuka addressed the council Tuesday, and the 
rezoning passed without discussion. The zoning will take effect in about two 
months, when the council is expected to approve several ordinances needed to 
enact the changes. 
</P>
<P>
Hiuka president David Creigh could not be reached for comment. But several city 
officials said Hiuka has decided simply to relocate, rather than contest the 
zoning change. A spokesman for the Port of Los Angeles said Hiuka wants to move 
the scrap yard to a new location within the port, possibly Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
"The search for alternative sites is active and ongoing," said spokesman Chuck 
Ellis. "Some sites have already been identified as having potential." 
</P>
<P>
Flores said Hiuka officials came to realize that "this is not the best spot for 
that kind of operation." She said her office has encouraged the company to find 
a location away from residential areas. "My aim never was to put them out of 
business," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Noah Modisett, president of the San Pedro Peninsula Homeowners Coalition, said 
residents as far away as Western Avenue have been bothered by noise from the 
Hiuka operation. Over the years, residents have also complained that the scrap 
yard is an eyesore, although Hiuka attempted to address those concerns by 
erecting a berm and redwood fence along the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"This has not just been a local neighborhood thing," said Modisett, whose 
coalition of 20 homeowner groups called for Hiuka's ouster in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "This has been long and hard work. We are really happy to see 
progress made." 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for West Oil Terminals and West Basin Co., which own the scrap yard 
property and lease it to Hiuka, said the two companies did not object to the 
council action because Hiuka "is hoping to move the scrap yard anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Although apparently resolving the scrap yard problem, the new zoning does 
little to address community concerns about fuel tanks in the area. Property 
west of Gaffey will be zoned for light industry, which prohibits fuel tanks, 
but the existing tank farms will not be affected because they are exempted from 
zoning laws, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new zoning places only minor restrictions on two fuel tank 
farms east of Gaffey, which residents had hoped to eliminate. The zoning bars 
the tank farms from growing "substantially," but allows the property to be 
upgraded and additional tanks to be built. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the scrap yard, which opened in 1985 because of a loophole in a zoning 
ordinance, city planning officials said the tank farms have been in existence 
since the 1920s, predating residential development in the North Gaffey area. 
</P>
<P>
Planning officials sided with West Oil Terminals and West Basin Co., which also 
own the tank farms east of Gaffey, in deciding it would be unfair to severely 
restrict use of the property. Lawyers for the owners argued at a hearing early 
this year that to target the whole area in order to close the scrap yard would 
be to take a "meat-cleaver approach" to a problem that requires a scalpel. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said she agreed to less stringent restrictions on the tank farms as part 
of a compromise with the Planning Commission, which at one point was opposed to 
rezoning the scrap yard or the tank farms. 
</P>
<P>
"The planning commission felt (the tank farms) had some proprietary rights, 
because they were there first," Flores said. "While we would prefer they be 
someplace else, the timing wasn't right to do it this time." 
</P>
<P>
Modisett, the homeowner coalition leader, said residents were more concerned 
about the scrap yard than the tank farms. He also expressed confidence that 
development trends eventually will resolve resident concerns over the tank 
farms. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing in San Pedro is a move away from heavy industry and toward 
clean industries," Modisett said. "The time will come when it just won't be 
economically feasible to keep the tanks there any more."

2 CHARGED IN DRUG-SMUGGLING CASE TIED TO COSTA RICA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two men have been charged in federal court in San Diego in connection with the 
seizure of 261 pounds of cocaine allegedly smuggled from Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
Customs agents, along with members of a task force composed of federal agencies 
and officials from Southern California law enforcement agencies, arrested the 
two men last week. 
</P>
<P>
Dirk Francis Jennings, 52, an unemployed U.S. citizen who had been living in 
Costa Rica, was arrested in San Diego. He was charged Friday with conspiracy to 
possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute, said Assistant U.S. 
Atty. John Kraemer. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Facility. 
</P>
<P>
John Daniel Cornwell Jr., 42, a shipbuilder from Manhattan Beach, was arrested 
last week in Long Beach after agents found the cocaine, worth $2 million, in 
five duffel bags in his car. He was charged Tuesday with the same offense as 
Jennings. He will be brought to the San Diego correctional facility in a few 
days, Kraemer said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a 27-foot fishing boat, which agents believe was used to smuggle 
the cocaine, was seized in Chula Vista on July 27, said customs spokesman John 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The boat had a registration number but no name. Customs agents have not 
determined who owns it, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the arrests are important because it might signal a change in the 
route that drug smugglers are using. 
</P>
<P>
"The unique thing was the distance it came from Costa Rica by water," Miller 
said. "Normally it comes through Mexico. Maybe it's an indication that drug 
smugglers are going around Mexico now." DEANNA BELLANDI

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING SET ON TORRANCE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Torrance city proposal to change the financing and timetable for a major 
redevelopment project will be reviewed at a hearing later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, on Tuesday scheduled the 
hearing for Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
There was no discussion of the proposal, which would amend the city's 
industrial redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires a hearing before the plan can be changed. The city will 
notify property owners in the redevelopment area, as well as others who live 
within 300 feet of it, about the hearing date, said Mike Bihn, senior principal 
planner. 
</P>
<P>
The city had set a ceiling of $90 million to rehabilitate 292 acres on its east 
side. But the project -- due to be completed in 2013 -- has proven more costly 
than planned. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment would allow the city to spend another $90 million on the 
project and extend the timetable 20 years, to 2033. Los Angeles County 
officials have said they would be entitled to a larger share of property taxes 
from the amended project. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was set for 7 p.m. in the City Council chambers. Council members 
could take action on the plan that night, Bihn said.

Sugar Price Supports 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 150 to 271, the House rejected an amendment to lower from 18 cents 
to 16 cents per pound the level at which the government props up the price of 
domestic sugar. Although the program sets an artificially high price that works 
its way through to consumers, it operates at small cost to the Treasury. The 
vote occurred as the House debated a five-year extension of federal farm 
programs (HR 3950). 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Jim Moody (R-Wis.) said: "To vote against this amendment is to say, 
'Down with the consumers, up with the handful of producers that benefit.' " 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jerry Huckaby (D-La.) said "the sugar program is a consumer program 
(providing) stable supplies of sugar at a solid, reasonable, predictable 
price." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to lower federal price supports and thus the market price of 
sugar.

Farm Subsidies 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 159 to 263, the House rejected a farm bill amendment to deny 
federal crop support payments to the nation's wealthiest farmers, those with 
adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 or more. The amendment would have reduced 
spending for loans, direct payments and other subsidies by $700 million 
annually. Some 20,000 individuals and 4,500 farm entities would have been 
denied payments under the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Bill Green (R-N.Y.) asked: "Is it such a harsh thing to ask that 
people who are above $100,000 a year in income come off the dole?" 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Neal Smith (D-Iowa) said the purpose of farm payments is not income 
maintenance but to stabilize supplies and prices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to end taxpayer subsidies of the nation's wealthiest farmers.

Honey Program

By a vote of 178 for and 215 against, the House rejected an amendment to phase 
out the federal honey program over four years. This put the House treatment of 
honey in the new farm bill at odds with that of the Senate, which voted (below) 
to end the 51-year-old loan program that guarantees profits to about 2,000 
beekeepers regardless of market conditions. The program cost $385 million 
during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.) called honey supports "the most ridiculous 
giveaway program to ever wriggle its way into the law books." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Glenn English (D-Okla.) said the honey program "has provided great 
benefit to not only American agriculture but the American consumer." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to phase out the federal subsidy of beekeepers.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PIT BULL KILLED AFTER BITING OFFICER

WHEEL FACTORY PARALYZED AS 800 WORKERS WALK OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA GRIEGO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 800 workers at the Rancho Dominguez factory of a Toronto-based wheel 
manufacturer have walked off their jobs to protest what they call heavier 
workloads without adequate compensation. 
</P>
<P>
The strike virtually shut down the production of aluminum wheels at the main 
plant of American Racing Equipment Inc., 19200 S. Reyes Ave. Workers crowded 
the streets and parking lots around the plant Wednesday, milling quietly in 
large groups while employee representatives from several departments met with 
plant managers. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting ended at 2:30 p.m. without an agreement being reached. 
</P>
<P>
The workers, who are not represented by a union, are demanding better working 
conditions, more pay and a more comprehensive benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
Management is "trying out new methods, making changes, and we don't like it," 
said Armando Gaipo, a mechanic at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"They have one person doing the job of three or four people," he said, "but 
they are not paying us for that extra work. . . . There is too much pressure. 
It's not safe." 
</P>
<P>
As the workload increases, so does the pressure to work faster, and some 
workers expressed concern that this could lead to accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Employees said the average starting pay is $5.30 an hour but did not say how 
big a raise they are demanding. Company representatives could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
American Racing Equipment Inc. is owned by Toronto-based Noranda Inc. and 
operates three plants employing about 2,000 people in this small industrial 
town south of Compton. Workers walked out of the main plant, in which about 
1,200 employees manufacture standard and custom aluminum wheels. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining employees, including who work at corporate headquarters and the 
steel division of the plant, refused to join the walkout, striking workers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Troubles began early this year when management hired a consulting firm called 
Synergistics, striking workers said. Employees of the firm clocked employees at 
their jobs and recommended several changes. 
</P>
<P>
Workers said Wednesday they did not know what recommendations had been made, 
but last week several employees were either fired or laid off, and the 
remaining employees were told to take over their workload. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, foundry workers, who reportedly lost several employees in their 
department, began talking to other employees of the main plant about striking. 
On Monday, the entire second shift of about 300 employees walked off the job. 
On Tuesday, nearly all employees in the plant joined them, workers said. 
</P>
<P>
The strike, which has paralyzed production, comes at a key time for the 
company, which is preparing to begin production of new rims for automobile 
companies, including General Motors and Ford. If the work orders are not met, 
the company will lose money, said Peter Olney, a coordinator for the 
International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine &amp; 
Furniture Workers. 
</P>
<P>
Olney, who said representatives of his union will be meeting with the 
disgruntled workers, said he was impressed by the size and strength of the 
strike force. 
</P>
<P>
"They are without union representation, and they succeeded in pulling off this 
type of strike," Olney said. "Some unions exist for years without showing this 
much strength." 
</P>
<P>
Almost two years ago, employees rejected union representation in a close vote, 
workers said. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time employees have walked out at the plant, striking 
workers said. In the early 1980s the plant, then under different ownership and 
called Los Angeles Modern Wheel, was hit by two job actions. Both times, 
workers said, their demands were met.

PUMPS SLOWER ON FIRST DAY OF 5-CENT-A-GALLON HIKE IN GAS TAX; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: MANY CUSTOMERS FILLED THEIR TANKS THE DAY BEFORE, BUT SOME ARE 
GRUMBLING ABOUT THE VOTER-APPROVED INCREASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
San Diego gasoline dealers said business appeared slower than usual Wednesday, 
the first day of a statewide 5-cent-a-gallon tax increase, as motorists 
grumbled and shook their heads over paying an extra nickel. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, it seems as if prices are drifting up anyway. There's been this 
gradual increase in prices, and now that's being compounded by this tax 
increase," said Bill Bleha of Carlsbad, who was filling up his tank Wednesday 
at an Encinitas service station. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ratoner, owner of a Shell station conveniently located off an Interstate 5 
ramp in Chula Vista, said his usually thriving business, teeming with tourists 
headed to Mexico, was lagging Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people took advantage of the prices on Tuesday. Even if they didn't 
need the gas, they filled up their tanks," he said. "Business is slow now, but 
that's only temporary. They have to come back and fill up eventually." 
</P>
<P>
Ratoner said Wednesday's price increase is the largest one-time increase in gas 
prices he can remember since the 1979 oil crisis. "My customers usually don't 
mind if prices fluctuate a few pennies up or down, but this 5-cent increase is 
pretty hefty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The nickel increase in California's gas tax went into effect midnight Tuesday, 
and a penny will be added each Jan. 1 for the next four years. Proceeds have 
been earmarked for the state's transportation program to repair highways and 
bridges, ease traffic congestion and pour more funds into commuter rail 
transit. 
</P>
<P>
"Our prices are so high here in San Diego anyway, it really doesn't matter 
anymore," Bleha said. "Whenever I go to L.A., I always make sure I fill up 
there." 
</P>
<P>
For the last few months, San Diego drivers have been paying higher gas prices 
on average than motorists in Los Angeles and other parts of the country, 
sometimes as much as 10 cents more a gallon. Now, that gap is closing to about 
4 cents, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Still, bargain hunters who shop around in San Diego will have a harder time 
finding good deals at the gas pump. ARCO stations around the county, which 
before Wednesday charged a thrifty 99 cents per gallon for regular gas, bumped 
that price up to $1.05, still stiff competition for other service stations 
charging as much as $1.17. 
</P>
<P>
"We were extra busy yesterday (Tuesday) because we let our regular customers 
know about the increase. Lots of people came rushing in today to try to beat 
the prices, but it was too late for them," said Letty Sanchez, a clerk at a 
downtown ARCO station. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people were shocked, but they know they have to buy gas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent and Teri Campanaro, a Phoenix couple vacationing in San Diego, said 
they were surprised at the high gas prices they found in the area. "We pay 
$1.10 for a gallon in Arizona," Vincent said, as he pumped regular unleaded gas 
costing $1.23 per gallon into his tank. "That's a big jump," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Cardenas, a traveling industrial sales representative who said he fills up 
at least twice a week and spends about $120 a month on gasoline, said he voted 
against the tax increase last June. "They should find the money elsewhere and 
cut the waste out of the bureaucracy before asking us for more money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time taxes are raised for what they say will be road improvements, it 
never gets done," Cardenas said. "I expect our gas prices to do nothing but 
keep going up." 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas and other motorists are concerned that gas prices will continue to 
climb, especially since OPEC's announcement last week of an agreement to raise 
prices, which could mean another dime-per-gallon increase. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists ticked off about dishing out an extra nickel-per-gallon Wednesday 
said they knew the increase was approved but did not expect to see prices at 
the pump go up so soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was coming, but I didn't realize it was today until I heard it on 
the radio," said Maddie Townley, a Golden Hill resident and regular customer at 
a downtown Shell station. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope the tax money goes to the road because we sure need it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Carolee Ferguson of Escondido, who was filling her tank at an Encinitas Texaco 
station, said she doesn't like paying higher prices but thinks the trade-off is 
worth it. "They're asking for the money to improve roads and relieve congested 
areas. Since we are the ones who use the roads, we should pay for it," Ferguson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most San Diego service stations tacked an extra 6 cents, not 5 cents, to their 
Tuesday prices. "We're having to add more than 5 cents to cover the federal oil 
spill liability surcharge and other taxes," said Judy Eppler, owner of a La 
Mesa Chevron station. "We would have lost one-third of a cent for every gallon 
we sold if we hadn't gone up that extra penny," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some customers out there have a feeling that the dealer is out to gouge them, 
but we're at the bottom of the pecking order. We're forced to pass on our extra 
costs to them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Eppler, who has owned the station for two years, said she didn't make her price 
change until mid-morning. "Once I switched the numbers on the sign outside, 
business slowed down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesman Jim Larson said the tax will enable the state to invest in a 
high-level transportation program. "People need to realize that the increase is 
for improvements to benefit everybody and to keep mobility on our freeways 
high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 111 was approved by voters last June, and the statewide gas tax 
should raise $15.5 billion for the state's transportation department over the 
next 10 years, according to Lisa Covington in Caltrans' Sacramento office. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County should receive $518 million over the next seven years in 
highway and transportation money, said Bill Tuomi, manager of the 
transportation program with the San Diego Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
That money will be used for construction of a $180-million interchange at I-5 
and the proposed California 56 in North County, as well as to buy a 
$110-million tract along 40th Street in University Heights to complete a leg of 
Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
Other local uses of the gas tax increase include: 
</P>
<P>
* $22 million as the state's share in creating a four-lane freeway on 
California 76, between I-5 and El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
* $21 million to widen and fix California 78, from a portion in Vista to San 
Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
* $22.6 million to widen bridges, put in median barriers and build 
park-and-ride lots on I-5, I-15 and California 163. 
</P>
<P>
* $11.7 million to upgrade six lanes on I-15, from Oceanview Boulevard to 
California 94. 
</P>
<P>
* $20 million to build truck lanes on various freeways. 
</P>
<P>
* $17 million to build a traffic operations center and additional freeway ramp 
metering. 
</P>
<P>
* $230 million to be shared by the 18 cities in the county for local street and 
road improvements over the next 10 years.

Balanced-Budget Amendment 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 279 to 150, the House failed to achieve the two-thirds majority 
needed to approve a constitutional amendment (HJR 268) requiring the federal 
government to balance its budget each year. Deficit spending was to have been 
outlawed except during wartime or if three-fifths majorities of the House and 
Senate voted to permit it. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Charles W. Stenholm (D-Tex.) said lawmakers lack "courage and guts" 
to master the deficit and therefore "we need some help, an extra tool. We need 
a balanced-budget amendment." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) said the measure "is filled with soft and fuzzy 
feel-good words that by themselves have no more legislative meaning than a 
bumper sticker that says 'Have a Nice Day.' " 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the constitutional amendment.

Balanced-Budget Statute 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 282 to 114, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 5258) 
requiring that the President and congressional budget committees draft balanced 
federal budgets each year showing the exact spending cuts and revenue hikes 
they recommend to stay out of the red. If Congress votes down the proposals, it 
would then pass a standard deficit-laden budget to run the government. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders produced the bill to counter the GOP plan (above) to balance 
the budget by constitutional amendment. They said it was important for 
balanced-budget advocates to state precisely how they would avoid a deficit. 
But Republicans denounced the bill as political cover for those who voted 
against the constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the Democratic bill.

To Cut Farm Spending 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 202 to 216, the House refused to cut discretionary spending in a 
fiscal 1991 agriculture appropriations bill (HR 5268) by 2% across the board, 
saving $150 million. Exempted from the cut was to have been a nutritional 
program for poor infants and spending mandated by law. The $50.4-billion 
measure was sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.) said the "very modest" cut would help offset 
the bill's 11.5% increase over 1990 spending. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jamie L. Whitten (D-Miss.) said he believes in a balanced federal 
budget "but not at the expense of sound and essential programs." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the 2% cut.

U.S. DELAYS CLEANUP OF ROCKWELL LAB BUILDING; 
</P>
<P>
RADIOACTIVITY: ENERGY OFFICIALS HOPE TO DECONTAMINATE THE SITE WHEN THE PROCESS 
BECOMES CHEAPER AND SAFER.

<P>
The U.S. Department of Energy said it has decided to monitor and contain a 
radioactively contaminated building at Rockwell International's Santa Susana 
Field Laboratory east of Simi Valley rather than immediately undertake a costly 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
DOE officials assured Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who represents the 
area, that Building 24 at the Rockwell site in the Simi Hills, where Rockwell 
has done nuclear work for the government for the past 35 years, poses no health 
or safety risk and requires no imminent action. 
</P>
<P>
R.P. Whitfield, associate director of DOE's Office of Environmental 
Restoration, told Gallegly that the DOE decided to postpone indefinitely the 
planned demolition of the building until new technologies are developed to make 
the process safer and less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Whitfield said he expects such methods to be available in five to eight years 
and the cleanup to be done in 10 to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the DOE will spend $15,000 a year for containment and 
twice-monthly monitoring instead of commencing a $4.4-million cleanup in the 
1992 fiscal year. The DOE had said in a draft plan in November, 1989, that the 
monitoring was a cost-saving alternative to the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Following a 45-minute meeting in his office attended by five DOE officials, 
Gallegly said he was satisfied "that there's not an imminent health and safety 
concern out there." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he told Whitfield and his DOE associates that, given intense 
public concern, "10 to 12 years, from a perception standpoint, is not 
acceptable to me" to do the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The radioactivity is in concrete vaults and a reinforcing bar beneath the 
Rockwell building, which are secured behind two padlocked doors, said Roger 
Liddle, DOE's restoration project manager at Santa Susana. The above-ground 
portion of the structure is used as a warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell has found that the amount of radioactivity outside Building 24 is no 
higher than levels that occur naturally in soil and rays from the sun, said 
Clark Gibbs, general manager for Rockwell of the Energy Technology Engineering 
Center, which Rockwell operates under contract with the DOE at Santa Susana. 
The levels within the vaults are 20 to 40 times greater than those that occur 
naturally, but the secured structure is far from any public area, Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it would be a vain waste of resources" to go in and clean it up, he 
said.

<P>
A Van Nuys woman was killed Wednesday morning when her pickup truck overturned 
on a curve on Laurel Canyon Road in Studio City, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Jean Ettinger, 20, who had recently moved to Van Nuys from Arizona, died 
instantly in the 5:20 a.m. accident on the winding canyon road about half a 
mile north of Mulholland Drive, Officer Leona Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Ettinger apparently lost control of the vehicle while driving at an 
unsafe speed on a curve. 
</P>
<P>
The pickup overturned and ejected her. It overturned several more times and hit 
a concrete block in front of a house. 
</P>
<P>
The accident closed two of the four lanes during the morning rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
Southbound traffic was backed up two miles to Ventura Boulevard.

CONVENTION FOCUSES ON BLACK CLOUT IN THE MEDIA

African Americans should not rely on Hollywood film studios to advance the 
image and economic status of blacks, TV producer Keenan Ivory Wayans told a 
gathering of journalists in the opening session Wednesday of the 15th annual 
convention of the National Assn. of Black Journalists at the Century Plaza 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to build our economic base through black corporate America," said 
Wayans, producer and star of the irreverent Fox TV program "In Living Color." 
</P>
<P>
But Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, said major 
entertainment companies also must change the way they operate. 
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility must rest with studios who have the power and the money," 
Katzenberg said. "We must take it upon ourselves to change the way we do 
business and to create opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
The comments reflect in part a response to a report by the Beverly 
Hills/Hollywood chapter of the NAACP that there are fewer executive 
opportunities for blacks in the entertainment industry than there were 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's panel, "Blacks in Hollywood," attracted about one-third of the 
1,500 conventioneers and featured none of the fireworks that punctuated a 
similar discussion at the NAACP conference last month at the Los Angeles 
Convention Center. There, some panelists charged that racist practices have 
kept black Americans from key positions in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset of Wednesday's forum, moderator Barbara Rogers, a reporter for 
KPIX-TV in San Francisco, told the audience, "We want this to be a positive 
dialogue. That doesn't mean you can't ask tough questions, but we don't want 
this to be a session that generates more heat than light." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Medavoy, chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, acknowledged some trepidation 
about appearing on the 10-member panel. He quipped that colleagues warned him 
he was "headed for a firing squad," but he felt it was important to attend.

CHARGERS' LEE WILLIAMS TO RETURN TO CAMP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pro Bowl defensive lineman Lee Williams, who left town Saturday in a contract 
dispute with the Chargers, will end his walkout this weekend and return to 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Bobby Beathard said he was informed of Williams' decision in a 
telephone conversation Wednesday with his agent, Steve Feldman of Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said Feldman told him Williams will report back to UC San Diego 
sometime Saturday. But he will not rejoin the team in time to take part in 
three days of joint practices with the Phoenix Cardinals beginning today at the 
Cardinals' training site in Flagstaff, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
"Lee is coming in because we felt we could be more productive dealing with the 
club with Lee here than out," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams left camp over what Feldman said was a broken promise to renegotiate a 
five-year contract Williams signed in 1988. Feldman said Williams was promised 
by Beathard's predecessor, Steve Ortmayer, that the team would renegotiate the 
contract if he had consecutive Pro Bowl seasons, which he accomplished last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
That contract, which runs though the 1992 season, will pay Williams 
approximately $700,000 in base pay this season, sources have said. Feldman is 
seeking a deal that would pay Williams more than $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The leaving was more a reaction than a demand," Feldman said. "Our demands 
remain the same. We're going to continue to request the club honor its 
obligation to Lee." 
</P>
<P>
But Beathard said the team has not changed its opposition to renegotiating 
Williams' contract and made no concessions to assure his return to training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of his planned return to camp came one day before Williams 
faces the possibility of a season-long suspension without pay. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said the suspension will not be imposed but that the team had not made 
a decision whether to fine Williams for his absence. Under NFL rules, Williams 
can be fined a maximum of $1,500 per day for not reporting to camp while under 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers reduced to six their number of unsigned players when inside 
linebacker Cedric Figaro signed and reported in time for the afternoon workout. 
</P>
<P>
Figaro said he agreed to a one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
Figaro has started 19 of 22 games in his two seasons with the Chargers, but 
this year he figures to be competing for playing time at inside linebacker with 
Gary Plummer, who has led the Chargers in tackles in all four of his seasons 
with the team, and Junior Seau, the team's unsigned No. 1 draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
In other negotiations, Beathard said he extended by one day, until today, the 
deadline for offensive guard David Richards to sign and report or face a 
reduction in his latest contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said he granted the extra day after talking with Richards' agent, 
Randy Vataha of Boston. Vataha said Richards had some extenuating circumstances 
that justified an extension. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said after the afternoon workout that he had not heard from offensive 
tackle Broderick Thompson, who had been given the same deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The agent for Thompson, Jeff Irwin of Scottsdale, Ariz., has said Thompson was 
told the team's offer would be reduced by $5,000 if had not signed by 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Troy Johnson was back at training camp Wednesday for the first 
time since he was hospitalized Thursday after breaking three ribs and 
puncturing a lung in a scrimmage against the Rams. . . . The Chargers have 
re-signed linebacker David Brandon and placed him on injured reserve after 
reclaiming him from waivers. Brandon is out for the season after knee surgery 
in May. . . . The Chargers next practice at UC San Diego will be at 9 a.m. 
Monday.

JENSON LEAVES TEXAS SAN ANTONIO FOR PEPPERDINE

<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine basketball Coach Tom Asbury lost the first recruiting battle two 
years ago for 6-foot-8 forward Byron Jenson, but on Wednesday Asbury won the 
second one when Jenson announced he was transferring to Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury recruited Jenson heavily when he was a senior at Salpointe High School 
in Tucson in 1987-88, but Jenson signed with Texas San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, Jenson started several games, but he played a reserve role last 
season, averaging 3.1 points and 3.2 rebounds. This spring Texas San Antonio 
changed coaches, hiring Stu Starner to replace third-year coach Ken Burmeister. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said his opinion of Jenson's ability had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
"You always take a gamble on a kid, but I'm very familiar with his background 
and I like what's in it," Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a sound, fundamental player, and I anticipate that he will be a major 
contributor to our team." 
</P>
<P>
NCAA rules require that Jenson, who contacted Asbury last week when he first 
considered transferring, must redshirt this season. He will then have two 
seasons of eligibility remaining. ERIC SHEPARD

YANKEE HATERS MAY BE AT LOSS WITHOUT BOSS TO KICK AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
George Steinbrenner is apparently out of baseball for good, and everyone seems 
happy about it. But I wonder if people appreciate the contributions the man 
made, including, of course, his efforts in the fine art of buffoonery. (What's 
your favorite episode? Mine was the phantom elevator punch in Los Angeles, 
complete with bandaged hand and arm in a sling. Talk about your memories.) 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner accomplished much in his 17 years in baseball. He hired Billy 
Martin as manager five times, which would be legacy enough for most men. He 
started the spiral of player salaries. He once made his front-office staff take 
lie-detector tests. And he got Yogi Berra angry. Come on, if Richard Nixon gets 
a library, George has to get one, too. 
</P>
<P>
But when we think of Boss George years from now, we will remember him, and 
fondly, as the man who ruined the Yankees. Yankee haters will, anyway. The 
world, it seems to me, is divided between Yankee fans and Yankee haters. People 
who root for the Yankees also root for Donald Trump, or did until his recent 
problems. They're every front-runner's favorite team, unless it's the Boston 
Celtics. Rooting for the Yankees is a lot like rooting for a bank. They were 
corporate America, back when that was a good thing to be. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner changed all that. One man did it. One man slipped cogs into every 
wheel of the once-feared machine, and he did it while everyone was watching. He 
made the pinstripes run soggy with tears. 
</P>
<P>
That is a legacy and a half. He bought the House That Ruth Built and took a 
wrecking ball to it. Let's hope he doesn't buy the Sistine Chapel next. The 
bozos you have to wonder about are the people who appointed him to straighten 
out the U.S. Olympic effort. You can bet the Russians are hoping he doesn't get 
suspended again. 
</P>
<P>
Have you seen his team play? The Yankees are not simply in last place in the 
American League East. They are the worst team in baseball, and their prospects 
for immediate return to glory are only slightly greater than the Ottoman 
Empire's. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, but it was fun to watch. We sat laughing through 18 managerial changes, 
usually made after promising that he wouldn't and often resulting in a TV 
commercial with Billy Martin. There were 13 general managers and more pitching 
coaches than anyone has ever bothered to count. Most stadiums have large gates. 
Yankee Stadium had a revolving door. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, it worked. He bought the great players who had turned free agents 
and they won together, the Los Angeles elevator incident notwithstanding. But 
as Yankee Stadium became the Bronx Zoo, players came to see that playing for 
Steinbrenner was not quite the option it seemed. The stars stopped coming. 
Unless they were old or worn out or used up. Or overpaid. Or overrated. And 
then there was Dave Winfield, who fought with Steinbrenner for nearly a decade 
and then, in the end, if indirectly, finally brought him down. 
</P>
<P>
As the Yankees grew worse and worse, the fans grew angrier and angrier, and 
maybe that was the best thing. They had to learn how the other half lived. 
Where has all the smugness gone, long time passing? 
</P>
<P>
But the anger did fuel more jokes. There was the "Saturday Night Live" bit in 
which there was a Steinbrenner health watch. The reporter would come on to 
report more bad news: George was healthy as a horse. 
</P>
<P>
At Yankee Stadium, there would be loud anti-Steinbrenner chants. The misery 
hung heavy in the air like a Pascual Perez curveball. 
</P>
<P>
Then Howard Spira, the gambler who apparently sold Steinbrenner dirt on 
Winfield, entered the scene, and now Steinbrenner, thanks to Commissioner Fay 
Vincent, has left it. He cannot run the team anymore, although he does not have 
to sell it. He cannot make any team decisions. He can't even attend Yankee 
games without written permission. This would seem to be bad news for Yankee 
haters. Vincent has said that all Yankee front-office moves for the next five 
years have to be approved by him. This would seem to be bad news for Yankee 
haters, too. 
</P>
<P>
But all may not be lost. It has been reported that Steinbrenner has nominated 
his son, Hank, to succeed him as managing partner of the team. If this move is 
approved -- and I'm guessing that Steinbrenner has already discussed the matter 
with Vincent -- do we really believe that he won't be talking to his son, 
whispering in his ear, telling him to fire whoever the manager might then be? 
Do you think there are enough safeguards to keep Steinbrenner's hands off when 
his son's hands are full? 
</P>
<P>
This is a man, you'll recall, who was convicted for contributing illegal 
campaign funds to Nixon. He's sneaky. He's conniving. And he may have a blood 
relative at the controls. What's scary is that Boss George might be back before 
he gets a chance to leave. If that brings a smile to your face, you're no kind 
of Yankee fan.

IMPROVISATION ALL PART OF MASTER PLAN IN BOWMAN'S CASE; 
</P>
<P>
FIGURE SKATING: FORMER NATIONAL CHAMPION TAKES LIGHT APPROACH TO HIS GOODWILL 
GAMES PERFORMANCE. 
</P>

<P>
Christopher Bowman couldn't resist. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a choice of playing it straight or improvising, the 1989 national 
figure-skating champion made like Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, one day before Bowman would make his Goodwill Games debut, an 
unsuspecting reporter asked him which free-skating routine he planned to use. 
</P>
<P>
Planned to use? 
</P>
<P>
We all know what happened the last time Bowman planned such an exercise. 
</P>
<P>
If not, go back to March 11 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, site of the world 
championships: 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, 23, who grew up in Van Nuys, knew he needed to score well in free 
skating. He was sixth in the compulsory figures and fourth in the original 
program. Only a spectacular effort in the long program would move him into 
medal contention. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through his final event, he decided that the routine that he, his 
coach, his choreographer and a few other advisers had worked on for months 
wasn't going well enough. 
</P>
<P>
It needed more pizazz, more difficulty. So, after considering his options for a 
few milliseconds, Bowman did what any true showman would do. 
</P>
<P>
He made the rest of it up as he went along. 
</P>
<P>
And lo and behold, he got his medal -- a bronze. But in the process, he almost 
lost his coach. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Carroll, Bowman's coach, had seen enough. Tiffany Chin and Linda 
Fratianne, other Carroll proteges, had never been so unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
"If I am going to remain Christopher's friend, I cannot be his coach," Carroll 
said. After 18 tumultuous years, they would be splitting up. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, Carroll believed, didn't take skating seriously. He was talented, but 
not dedicated. But they did not split up. At least not yet. Carroll accompanied 
Bowman to the Tacoma Dome this week, although their relationship appeared to be 
on thin ice. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll declined interview requests this week and Wednesday told a spokesman he 
had "nothing positive to say." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us back to Bowman's intentions about his free-skating program. 
</P>
<P>
His routine will be the same one he never completed at the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to do it in its original form this time," Bowman deadpanned. "People 
told me they would be real interested in seeing this program done again. They 
wanted to see the unedited version." 
</P>
<P>
So they will. Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman will compete seventh among the eight men's skaters. He follows Canada's 
Kurt Browning, the current world champion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an excellent draw because I get to see how they skate before me and then 
I can decide whether I can change my program or not," Bowman quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Typical Bowman. Always the performer. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Bowman appeared in more than 200 television commercials and had bit 
parts in "Little House on the Prairie," and "Archie Bunker's Place." 
</P>
<P>
He juggled acting, schoolwork and skating until he was 18. Then he chose to 
concentrate on skating, and he says he will do so through the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll has been with him since Bowman, at age 5, took lessons at Van Nuys 
Iceland. They clashed over the Goodwill (a misnomer in this case) Games before 
they ever arrived in Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
"(Carroll) was very reluctant about coming to this event because he felt that 
if you're not totally prepared then you shouldn't be going," said Bowman, who 
was eager to compete but trained for only two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The Goodwill Games is something that is a very elite event. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like a national championship or a world championship where everything 
is on the line." 
</P>

HANG GLIDING: TO SOAR LIKE A BIRD IS PARADISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For centuries, people have fancied flight. 
</P>
<P>
But not until 1960 -- after the Wright Brothers took off, airplane travel 
mounted and orbiting the planet became a reality -- did man achieve a flight 
this fancy. 
</P>
<P>
That was when three men from Sydney, Australia, devised a way for humans to 
soar like birds, to attain what Greek mythology described in "The Flight of 
Icarus." The men, Bill Bennett, John Dickenson and Bill Moyes, invented the 
hang glider. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as close to being a bird as a human can get," said Joe Bill Henry, 
manager of the Torrey Flight Park. "You don't have an engine. You have a wing 
and no noise, just you and the birds." 
</P>
<P>
The inventors had been towing flat kites on water skis until they read an 
article in Popular Science magazine about a wing designed by Francis Rogallo. 
The wing, attached to a parachute, was designed for NASA for space re-entry and 
made of flexible material covered over three tubes spread in a fan shape. 
</P>
<P>
The men found that by using the Rogallo wing they had stability and 
maneuverability they didn't have with the kite. They continued to tow the 
glider behind a boat. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Rogallo) designed a parachute meant to come down," said Bennett, who now 
lives in Los Angeles. "We designed the glider to go up. It's like, the man who 
invented the wheel didn't invent the car, but without the wheel you couldn't 
have the car. It's the same concept. There were a lot of trials and a lot of 
errors." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett brought the sport to the United States in 1969 by giving an exhibition 
at the National Water Skiing Championships at Berkeley. From there, Bennett 
received offers to tour and give exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was so amazed by it," Bennett said. "So many people wanted to do it." 
</P>
<P>
At the inaugural race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, Bennett, giving a pre-race 
exhibition, was being towed behind a car. When the rope suddenly broke, Bennett 
was forced to maneuver and land the glider for the first time without being 
attached. The crowd, assuming it was part of the act, gave rousing applause. 
</P>
<P>
From then, Bennett began to perfect launching and landing without the aid of a 
tow. One of his first test sites was at Torrey Pines Gliderport in La Jolla, 
now the location of one of his businesses, the Torrey Flight Park. Bennett has 
been manufacturing gliders since 1970 for Delta Wing Kites and Gliders, Inc., 
of which he is part owner. Moyes has remained his business partner and has a 
business of the same name in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
"Hang gliding is on the move with the aid of computers, and California is 
becoming the aerospace capital of the world," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
The first design cost about $325, Bennett said, but now some hang gliders cost 
just under $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
First-timers to hang gliding often take tandem lessons. After a ground lesson, 
the student goes up with the instructor for one ride. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best tool for learning," said Dave Beardslee, tandem instructor at 
the Torrey Flight Park. "It's like riding in a car before actually learning to 
drive it. You get the feel of it first." 
</P>
<P>
Beardslee, who has been an instructor for 16 years and has taken more than 
2,500 people hang gliding, said that many tandem students are tourists who just 
want to try hang gliding once. Others, however, return for a lesson to fly 
solo. 
</P>
<P>
Henry said he has had students from ages 6 to 85. The only weight requirement 
is an upper limit of 300 pounds. When learning to fly, solo students first have 
a ground lesson and are put on a simulator to get the feel of the glider. Then 
they are taken to a training hill where they progress from flat to 30 feet to 
100 feet up the hill. 
</P>
<P>
"You use certain muscles in the body like riding a bicycle, running long 
distances or swimming," Henry said. "You use the same type of physical strength 
you'd use in those sports. But the glider isn't hard to maneuver." 
</P>
<P>
To fly in San Diego at any national park without an instructor present, an 
advanced license is required. Licenses are earned through flight and 
instruction and are numbered: 1 for beginner, 2 for novice, 3 for intermediate 
and 4 for the advanced pilot. Each year, the license must be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Henry said students learn at their own pace; it usually takes about three or 
four lessons to earn a beginner's license and about 12 to earn a novice 
license. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the licensing and new features on the gliders, the sport has become 
much safer than when it first began. Pilots wear a parachute that could carry 
both himself and the glider safely to the ground in case of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Henry began hang gliding because he said he needed to try something different. 
He had parachuted in the Army, raced cars and motorcyles and tried scuba 
diving. He and a friend built a glider in a garage and taught themselves to fly 
it. From there, Henry earned his license and, later, his instructor's license. 
Now, in addition to teaching, Henry is a test pilot for Delta Wing Kites and 
Gliders, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
All gliders must be certified before they are sold. As a test pilot, Henry 
takes a new glider through quality-control tests. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, a lot of people got hurt because there were no licenses or 
regulations," Henry said. "Now it's one of the safest sports." 
</P>

AT DEL MAR, THE INSIDE TRACK IS ON THE OUTSIDE 
</P>

DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Track foreman Robert Hernandez swears the main dirt track at Del Mar is not 
slanted. Veteran handicapper Bill Murray is not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
Murray thinks it's no coincidence that, through Wednesday, nearly one of every 
four horses (24%) that starts on the extreme outside is winning. And that of 
the first 50 races in this year's meet, 27 have been won by horses starting in 
one of the three outside positions. 
</P>
<P>
"About 10 years ago, it used to be the horses on the inside that dominated, but 
that's all changed," said Murray, who has written five novels on horse racing 
and has been coming to Del Mar for almost 25 years. "We used to call the inside 
'the jet stream.' But there was a flood in (1980) and I think the track's 
surface has changed since then. The horses that start on the inside seem to be 
all used up by the stretch, and the horses on the outside seem to be fresher." 
</P>
<P>
The 'outside' trend was never more evident than on Sunday, when five of the six 
Pick Six races were won by horses that started on the extreme outside. The only 
outside horse that lost did so on the turf course. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez admitted he's noticed the early trend of outside horses running well, 
but said the track's surface has nothing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
"The track is the same depth all the way across," Hernandez said. "We could cut 
it deeper, but then it wouldn't be even. We've got a two and 3/4 inch cushion 
now and that seems to be working fine." 
</P>
<P>
But Murray thinks something should be done to make the track more uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"When tracks are dominated by a particular position, it's up to the track 
superintendent to make adjustments," Murray said. "Here, they never change 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Are bettors changing their philosophy to compensate for a possible track bias? 
</P>
<P>
"All the smart bettors definitely are watching what's happened so far," he 
said. "It's hard to ignore." 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Robbie Davis' rough start got even rougher Wednesday when he injured his 
back during a morning workout. After finishing fourth in the Del Mar jockey 
standings last year, Davis has been shut out in 32 starts through five days. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 29, was held out of Wednesday's races and will probably miss Thursday's 
card and well. His last victory came in his final race at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Perceive Arrogance, coming off a seven-month layoff, will attempt to prevent 
Bayakoa from becoming the first female to win the San Diego Handicap Saturday. 
The $150,000 Grade III race will cover 1 1/16 miles. Laffit Pincay Jr. will 
ride Bayakoa, given a high weight of 122 pounds. Corey Black will ride Perceive 
Arrogance.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS SIGN GOALIE NOGUEIRA FOR 1990-91 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Goalkeeper Victor Nogueira has signed with the San Diego Sockers, becoming the 
secondplayer the Sockers have signed for the 1990-91 Major Soccer League 
season. Branko Segota is in the last year of a multi-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Nogueira, a 10-year veteran of the indoor game and in his second year with the 
Sockers, was fifth last season among MISL goalkeepers with a 3.61 average and 
an 11-13 record. In 1988-89, he was Goalkeeper of the Year and the MISL 
Championship Series MVP. 
</P>
<P>
"Victor is a good base to begin building another championship team around," 
Sockers Coach Ron Newman said. "In his two years with the Sockers, he 
established himself as one of the premier goalkeepers in the league, and I'm 
very happy to have him back in the fold." 
</P>
<P>
The Nogueira announcement brings to four the number of players who will 
definitely be back for 1990-1991. The Sockers last week matched an offer by 
Tacoma to free agent forward Rod Castro and defender Kevin Crow said at a press 
conference last week that he had agreed to a lower salary with the Sockers, 
though neither man has signed a contract yet. 
</P>
<P>
Defender Ralph Black is still talking to the Sockers, according to Newman, 
despite rumors that he is heading to Tacoma.

<P>
BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Guard Chris McKinney has signed a national letter of intent to play at San 
Diego State, according to SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg. McKinney, 6-foot-2, 
averaged 20.9 points and seven rebounds a game in his senior year at Lincoln 
High School in East St. Louis, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney led his team to a 29-4 record and third in the state tournament, where 
he was an All-Tournament selection. He joins other Aztecs who have signed: Joe 
McNaull, Keith Balzer, Mike Ferguson and James Lewis.

YOUNG CHILDREN CAN GET FREE SPEECH THERAPY; 
</P>
<P>
LANGUAGE: PUBLIC SCHOOLS OFFER SPECIAL PROGRAMS TO HELP 2- TO 5-YEAR-OLDS 
TACKLE SPEECH PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY REACH THE CLASSROOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Christina David was only 3 1/2 when her parents realized that only her family 
could understand her speech. 
</P>
<P>
The pediatrician told her parents that Christina's frequent ear infections -- 
which limited her ability to hear -- may have contributed to her language 
problem, and recommended speech therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Her parents, Dotty and Pablo David, spent about $3,500 for a year and a half of 
private speech therapy, yet still felt Christina was difficult to understand. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Davids found out that the Los Angeles Unified School District offers 
speech and language assessment and therapy, and they tried it. Within a few 
months, Christina had made great progress, and by the time she entered 
kindergarten, she had no speech problems. Now their son Mickey, 4, is getting 
speech therapy at Morningside School in San Fernando for a similar problem. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents are not aware that the best time to catch speech and language 
difficulties is early -- at age 2 to 3 -- which is several years before 
children start school. Some may not realize that help is available through the 
public schools for children that young. 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles Unified School District offers a range of programs designed 
to meet the needs of preschool and kindergarten students. The programs are 
available free to all children in the community, even if they are headed for or 
enrolled in private or parochial schools. 
</P>
<P>
The programs are mandated by federal and state laws that specifically require 
that services be available to children ages 3 to 5 as well as to those who are 
in school. 
</P>
<P>
The programs range from five-day-a-week classes for children with severe speech 
problems to once-a-week programs for children with minor speech lags. The 
programs include classroom enrichment designed to stimulate the language 
development of children in socio-economically disadvantaged areas to more 
traditional speech therapy with licensed, credentialed speech and language 
specialists. There are 78 speech and language therapists in the San Fernando 
Valley, serving 181 elementary, secondary and special education schools. 
</P>
<P>
According to Barbara Staley, a speech and language specialist at Montague 
Avenue School in Pacoima and at Morningside School, the first step for parents 
who think their children may have a problem is to call the Valley's Special 
Education Services office (818-997-2466) to request a screening. A speech and 
language specialist, a psychologist and a motor development specialist will 
assess the child's socialization, speech, language and motor skills and make a 
formal recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Children who show a mild delay in speech and language development may be 
referred to the Early Education Program, a 90-minute, once-a-week class that 
gives children special attention designed to build language skills and provide 
parents with language-related information and a parent support group. Children 
age 3 and older with more severe speech problems may be offered one of 55 
Special Day Class programs, which give special attention to six to eight 
children in a classroom five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
When Christopher Stone, 7, started the five-day-a-week special day class at 
Dearborne School in Northridge three years ago, he had a learning and speech 
delay problem that made even saying simple words difficult, said his father, 
Alan Stone, a Van Nuys graphic artist. 
</P>
<P>
Now Christopher is starting first grade -- and doing well -- with the added 
special reading and motor skill support from the school's resource teacher. 
"The language programs are one thing the school district does really well," 
Stone said. "And it's free. Chris' teacher treated him like he was her own 
child, and gave personalized attention to all six or eight kids in the class." 
</P>
<P>
Stone said he found that the private schools he checked into didn't have the 
facilities to work with children with special needs. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said he feels Christopher was lucky that his problems were identified 
early. Many of the children in Chris' kindergarten class, he said, clearly 
would have benefited from additional speech and language training but their 
parents were either unaware of the children's special needs or they assumed 
their speech development would eventually catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents don't realize that language problems do not necessarily go away as 
a child matures, Staley said. What is considered cute baby talk for a toddler 
may not work when children are put in social situations with other children. 
The child whose speech sounds different from the others can be singled out and 
teased, or may become self-conscious, frustrated or reserved, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, failing to get speech help early can lead to failure in school. 
"Reading and writing are just another dimension of oral language, and if 
children can't hear and say the words correctly, they will have trouble 
learning to read and write," Staley said. 
</P>
<P>
Just as some parents don't move aggressively to have their children's speech 
assessed when potential problems present themselves, Staley said others seem 
overly concerned and tense about their preschooler's failure to enunciate 
perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
"Many parents want to fix things right away, they want the language problems to 
be solved immediately," she said. "But parents, while they need to have 
problems looked at, also need to relax. You can't go to the bathroom for your 
child, you can't eat for your child and you can't make them talk. You have to 
build their self-esteem and have faith that things will start to happen." 
</P>
<P>
To help speed the children's development of language skills in 
socio-economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, the school district has 
targeted 18 kindergarten classrooms for the Oral Language Development Program. 
The program is designed to build the communication skills of kindergartners who 
may not have had the benefit of such language stimulation in a preschool 
environment, said Esther Meyers, a speech and language specialist and a program 
coordinator in the Valley. Speech and language specialists work with 
kindergarten teachers to build skills that the teachers can use immediately and 
with future classes, and they work directly with the children to help them 
learn to talk in the more formal environment of the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Staley, who works with 90 children in the program at Montague, said: "Many 
children are coming from a home environment where their family always knows 
what they're talking about, and when they're in the classroom they may not 
realize that the teacher and other students don't necessarily understand what 
they are talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Staley said the program teaches children to talk in front of the class and to 
speak in complete sentences, and it enriches the children's vocabulary through 
play activities and songs. 
</P>
<P>
Once their child has been identified as having a speech or language problem, 
some parents wonder whether they should use the school district services or 
give their children private speech therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Bernice Sedlik, a private speech and language specialist in Canoga Park, said 
she always advises parents to seek services through the public schools. 
"Parents usually do contact the public schools," she said, but added that there 
are situations in which the structure or the design of the services may not 
meet the parents' or the children's needs. 
</P>
<P>
"A school schedule may not be compatible with a parent's schedule, or parents 
may have a negative view of the services they will receive in the schools," she 
said. Sometimes, parents have expressed concern that the people testing the 
children do not seem comfortable working with preschoolers, or the services 
seem inconsistent due to holiday school closures or staff meetings that 
interrupt the regularly scheduled speech therapy sessions or classes. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit of private speech therapy is that the child gets more personal 
attention, since private sessions usually involve only one child while the 
public school speech therapy sessions often include two or three children. But 
she said that if a child qualifies for the early education program, she 
recommends that program over private therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"While parents sometimes wonder if their children can improve their speech 
skills in a classroom setting, by three-quarters of the way through the year, 
the parents realize the children have learned to speak well without one-to-one 
attention. You're changing their speech environments for the rest of their 
lives, by modeling for the parents and teaching the parents how to facilitate 
speech development, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Talk, Listen to Kids 
</P>
<P>
Tips for improving your child's speech and language skills from the Special 
Education Services Unit of the Los Angeles Unified School District: 
</P>
<P>
* Don't talk to your children as if they're 30. Speak slowly, use words they 
can understand and check to make sure they understand what you are saying. 
</P>
<P>
* Stop and listen to your children. Reinforce what they say by responding to 
them, letting them know you understand them. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't correct a child's mispronunciations; try to use the word for them 
properly, but casually, so they can hear it said correctly. 
</P>
<P>
* Try to enrich your child's vocabulary in daily life. Build on the words they 
use. If a child says, for example, "Look at this pretty flower," you can say, 
"Yes, I love the shape of the petals." 
</P>
<P>
* If you're unsure about your child's speech development, seek professional 
help. For free evaluation by the LAUSD, call (818) 997-2466.

Old Times 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 30 whopping days until school starts, and you've taken the 
children everywhere that might amuse, entertain, exhaust, enthrall or otherwise 
engage their tiny attention spans. 
</P>
<P>
They want more and they want it now. 
</P>
<P>
Try taking them back in time by introducing them to local history. 
</P>
<P>
It is not true that everything in the San Fernando Valley was built the day 
before yesterday. The city of Los Angeles has a Cultural Heritage Commission 
that identifies sites of historical significance and more than 30 are 
hereabouts and reachable before anyone can ask how long until you get there. 
</P>
<P>
The Leonis Adobe, 23537 Calabasas Road, in Calabasas, is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
What young person would not love a place with real cows grazing in the front 
yard around an authentic hanging tree used in the late 1800s to string up the 
bad guys? 
</P>
<P>
You will have to explain to them that the cows are real, as is the tree, not 
props like at Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the two-story hacienda there are people who will talk about the adobe's 
past, and fill the children's heads with stories of the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
The Leonis Adobe is open from 1 to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. There is no 
admission fee. For a booklet with pictures of more than 300 Los Angeles 
historical sites, write to Nancy Fernandez, Cultural Affairs Department, 433 S. 
Spring St., 10th Floor, Los Angeles, 90013. The commission accepts donations to 
defray the cost of updating the booklet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Into the Pool 
</P>
<P>
You would like to get out of the driver's seat and into a pool -- a car pool -- 
but it just wouldn't work for you, right? 
</P>
<P>
What would happen if you were at work and one of the children got sick, or if 
you got sick, or had to work late, or. . . ? 
</P>
<P>
If you work in Warner Center in Woodland Hills, Transportation Management 
Organization will put you back into the driver's seat -- or into a taxi -- in 
an emergency through its Guaranteed Ride Home program. 
</P>
<P>
Since June, 1989, when the Guaranteed Ride Home program went into effect, any 
one of the 40,000 people who work in Warner Center and car pool or van pool, 
can get home in a hurry in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
They simply get a voucher from their company for the cab fare or rental car 
fee, and they're on their way. 
</P>
<P>
Naomi Prince, who's in group sales at Blue Cross, put the program to test last 
April. 
</P>
<P>
She had a mean sore throat when she went into work, and by 10:30 in the 
morning, she couldn't talk and was told to go to bed and rest. 
</P>
<P>
The cab ride home cost $124 -- and it was paid by the Guaranteed Home Ride 
program. 
</P>
<P>
It made a believer of her. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Lacy in Blue Cross telecommunications is another believer. 
</P>
<P>
Also in April, her daughter's school called to say that the child had been in 
an accident. Within an hour Lacy was in a cab headed for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The program paid the $43 fare by voucher. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gary Newnham of Blue Cross human resources office, emergencies 
don't happen often, but when they do, the guaranteed ride has worked perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like an expensive proposition, but Christopher Park, who 
administrates the TMO for the Warner Center business community, says the 
program is almost never used. Park said it mainly helps allay fears of people 
who may commute 60 or 70 miles and are concerned about the what-ifs. 
</P>
<P>
Although this program was funded by the city, Park said other areas or 
companies could easily set it up in agreement with a cab company and a rental 
car company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Designer Dining 
</P>
<P>
It's been six months since the Valley got an over-the-hill-gang-approved 
restaurant, the Bistro Garden at Coldwater. 
</P>
<P>
But, popular over-the-hill wisdom to the contrary, the restaurant has not had 
to rely on the Beverly Hills set for business. 
</P>
<P>
According to the restaurant's Laura Stegman, the clientele is very Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Stegman, who is a sucker for the Garden's German apple pancake and chicken 
quesadillas, although not necessarily together, says the restaurant is filled 
for lunch and dinner with the well-healed and -connected, including lots of 
studio people such as MCA chief Lew Wasserman and Mary Tyler Moore, who, if 
they don't actually live in the Valley, may pick up a paycheck here. 
</P>
<P>
Business is inexplicably slower than expected for Sunday brunch, Stegman said. 
For $25.75, you may order from an overwhelming list of goodies that include 
papaya and shrimp, wild mushroom and onion pie, all sorts of egg things, the 
apple pancake, corned beef hash, and, for dessert, all manner of sweets, 
including the chocolate souffle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Drip 
</P>
<P>
If you thought Pizza Man delivered, check out the Department of Water and 
Power. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is it willing to light up your life, it is driving home the water 
conservation message. 
</P>
<P>
You can now call the DWP, (818) 909-3000, and make an appointment to have a 
representative come to your home and show you indoor and outdoor ways to save. 
</P>
<P>
There's no charge to DWP customers, which you have to be to get the man to come 
out. 
</P>
<P>
The representative will give you a checklist of things to do, and will install 
a free water-saving shower head. He will also tell you how to get a $100 rebate 
by installing a low-flush toilet. 
</P>
<P>
If you would like to read up before the visit, go to the Canoga Park DWP office 
at 7229 Winnetka Ave. or the Van Nuys office at 6550 Van Nuys Blvd., and pick 
up reams of free information.

SOVIET SINGERS, DANCERS SAIL INTO A WARM RECEPTION

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty Soviet sailors will be singing and dancing around town this week. But 
this group won't be doing it just for fun. They're participating in a series of 
tightly orchestrated outdoor public performances in San Diego and Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-member Soviet Song and Dance Ensemble of the Pacific Fleet, and the 
Soviet band that accompanies it, sailed into San Diego Tuesday morning, just 
one component in a historic visit by three Soviet navy vessels to this 
once-forbidden territory. 
</P>
<P>
They performed Tuesday night at a private party sponsored by the Chamber of 
Commerce at the U.S. Grant Hotel. And they moved yesterday to Sea World for a 
noon show. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Soviet ships leave Saturday morning, this vivacious troupe will 
appear for one-hour performances at noon today and tomorrow at the Organ 
Pavilion in Balboa Park. They will also present two-hour shows at 6:30 this 
evening at San Diego State University's Open Air Theatre and at 7:30 p.m. 
tomorrow evening at Tidelands Park in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
What is a musical troupe doing in the company of Soviet military on this 
landmark visit to San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
"Music and art are very good for helping us understand each other," said Col. 
Nicholay Bessubchenco, a Soviet public relations officer, said. 
</P>
<P>
"Such contacts bring about peace and harmony." 
</P>
<P>
Various cultural presentations are typical during official military visits by 
any nation, Cmdr. Cheryl Duft, the U.S. Navy's local liaison for the Soviet 
ensemble, said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the nature of these official visits. When U.S. ships go to 
high-visibility foreign ports, we have bands along doing the same thing. But 
the Soviets traditionally take song-and-dance troupes as well, to give people a 
chance to learn something about their culture," she said 
</P>
<P>
"An exchange of ships is a very big deal," Anatoley Kalekin, leader of the 
Soviet troupe, said through an interpreter. "This is one way to embellish 
that." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a good cross-section of ethnic forms, but the company's primary 
charter was to provide entertainment for the troops," Kalekin said. 
</P>
<P>
On those terms -- as pure, hands-across-the-sea entertainment -- the 
song-and-dance troupe succeeds. And, as Adm. Gennadly Alcksandrovich Khvatov, 
commander of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, said laughingly in a pre-show interview, 
the performers show American audiences another side of the Soviets: "We can 
recreate and rest too." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's preview performance at the U.S. Grant was part of a reception for 
local and visiting dignitaries, and the performance was somewhat limited by a 
stage too shallow and cramped to provide a proper showcase for such a large 
ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Time constraints prevented the group from presenting its full program. Even so, 
the performance was reminiscent of another military-based song-and-dance 
ensemble -- the Red Army Chorus, which brought San Diego audiences out in 
droves last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Army Chorus, which is 200 hundred strong, dished out Russian-style 
razzle-dazzle and bits of Americana in a glitzy, show-biz package. For them, 
Ethnic authenticity was less important than flaunting bravura style and 
fostering international harmony. 
</P>
<P>
The naval equivalent of the Red Army group proved to be similar in spirit, 
though a lot more modest in scale. Tuesday's concert, which lasted 75 minutes, 
ran the gamut from traditional Soviet ethnic songs and dances, to patriotic 
military displays and standard American tunes. The latter clearly had been 
added to the troupe's repertory as a token of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
In full-length performances tonight and tomorrow, the Soviets intend to 
emphasize full-bodied dancing and cultural diversity, of which Tuesday night's 
show gave just a sampling. 
</P>
<P>
The show displayed that Soviets are interested in U.S. culture. 
</P>
<P>
The singers performed the troupe's own version of "Home on the Range," "Hello 
Dolly" and "The Man I Love." And, like the Red Army, this troupe also had the 
crowd in rapture with a rousing chorus of "God Bless America," before bounding 
into a busy finale that packed the stage with costumed performers. 
</P>
<P>
The most successful piece on Tuesday's program was a contemporary, comic dance 
routine satirizing military life. Both the Soviets and their American hosts 
were quick to see the humor of brow-beaten sailors swabbing the decks and doing 
other necessary but unrewarding housekeeping chores. 
</P>
<P>
A phalanx of male dancers stopped the show in its tracks when they came on -- 
in perfect unison -- imitating a set of gears in a well-oiled machine. Only 
this machine kept bogging down, just when the frustrated mechanic thought he 
had solved the problem to get it running in high gear. 
</P>
<P>
Of the few pure ethnic dances on the program, the flashy show of martial arts 
and sword play done by men wielding wicked-looking lances and sabers was the 
most thrilling and kinetically satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cramped space, a band of agile men flung themselves into 
mock-combat, then followed with a series squatting kicks, tumbles, spread-eagle 
jumps and other traditional Cossack-style maneuvers to wild applause. 
</P>
<P>
Six women are included in the dance ensemble. They never got a chance to shine 
on Tuesday's program, although they kept popping up in different costumes, from 
ancient ethnic wear to chic sailor suits. The singers and musicians, some 
playing ancient instruments, fared better. They were given several 
opportunities to shine, and they had the audience clapping along merrily to 
their lusty seaman songs more than once. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the rafter-raising reception the Soviets got from this audience of 
about 600, San Diegans are right in tune with the Soviet military's brand of 
entertainment. And the enthusiastic Soviet song-and-dance troupe was obviously 
just as happy to be performing their first concert here. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of the concert, the singers intoned warmly to their audience: 
"Dear Friends, let us be just good friends."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: TOP TROMBONIST ANDERSON BRINGS QUARTET 
TO ELARIO'S

Serious jazz buffs know about Ray Anderson, but a casual listener might well 
ask "Ray who?" 
</P>
<P>
Anderson finds himself in the role of the underdog, trying build a career as a 
leader around the trombone, an instrument that hasn't always fared well in a 
leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Anderson, who plays Elario's Monday and Tuesday nights, is forging ahead. 
He has been voted best trombonist in the Downbeat Critics Poll for the last 
four years. His newest album, "What Because," includes pianist John Hicks, whom 
many believe to be one of the underrated greats. Anderson is quick enough and 
imaginative enough to carry a solo as well as a trumpet or sax player. He sings 
in a raspy growl reminiscent of Louis Armstrong and has played or recorded with 
Carla Bley, Charlie Haden, John Scofield, Anthony Braxton and Henry Threadgill. 
And for years, Anderson made his living in funk-band horn sections and recorded 
an album with a group called the Slickaphonics. 
</P>
<P>
At Elario's, Anderson will be joined by pianist Amina Claudine Myers, who also 
worked with Haden, plus bassist Mark Helias and drummer Dion Parson. There will 
be two shows nightly, at 8:30 and 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist-keyboard man David Benoit proved his musical prowess once and for all 
with last year's "Waiting for Spring." On that album, he departed from his 
usual dreamy, electric light jazz for some stirring acoustic jazz. Benoit's 
next album will mark a return to the electric mode. Benoit, a staple of light 
jazz radio, plays Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay this Sunday at 7 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar guitarist Peter Sprague is everywhere this week. Today, he plays the 
San Diego Museum of Art's "Jazz After Work" series at 4:30 on the steps of the 
museum, in Balboa Park. Vocalist Coral Thuet will be featured on several 
Brazilian tunes by such musicians as Antonio Carlos Jobim, Milton Nascimento, 
Djavan and Joao Bosco. Tonight, Sprague's trio plays the Full Moon Cafe in 
Encinitas; Friday night, the city of Carlsbad's TGIF Jazz series at Stage Coach 
Park (3420 Camino de los Coches); and Saturday night, Diego's Loft in Pacific 
Beach, above Diego's Mexican restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the trio's sets include several Brazilian-flavored songs written by 
guitarist Pat Metheny, with whom a young Sprague studied in Boston during the 
late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"They have such strong melodies, they can be done in a lot of contexts," 
Sprague said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the business side of his career is on a new path. He recently signed 
with a new manager, Dick Deutsch, who formerly managed the late guitarist Emily 
Remler. Deutsch's first task will be to shop around Sprague's demo tape in 
search of an album deal. 
</P>
<P>
Top local pianist Randy Porter, who works regularly with singer Diane Schuur 
and behind several top players at Elario's, is moving to Oregon in September. 
</P>
<P>
Porter, wife Cindy and month-old daughter Rachel Emily will live in a suburb of 
Portland, which Porter thinks might be a great place to raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people wonder why, when things seem to be going so well here, I would 
want to move up there," Porter said. "It's kind of a personal thing, for 
creative growth I want to achieve, which even takes priority over playing with 
other people. Being in a natural environment for me is more stimulating. Some 
people thrive around cement, but I like being around trees. 
</P>
<P>
Porter hopes to maintain his association with the young San Diego 
straight-ahead jazz band Common Ground, which also includes Steve Feierabend, 
Dave Marr and Tim McMahon. He hopes to return to Southern California often to 
play with Schuur and others. Porter plays the San Diego Museum of Art's "Jazz 
After Work" series with saxophonist Charles McPherson Aug. 16 at 4:30. He 
appears with Schuur Aug. 9 at The Strand in Redondo Beach; Aug. 10 at 
Humphrey's in San Diego; and Aug. 11 at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
During the Korean War years, Joe Franc played French horn with the 93rd Army 
Band, attached to the AAA (Anti-Aircraft Artillery) branch of the Army. Among 
his band mates: San Diegans Rod Cradit, Tony Higgins and John Pecoraro. 
</P>
<P>
The band played military marches, but also swing jazz for USO dances. Franc is 
putting together an Oct. 18 band reunion. If you were in the band or know 
someone who was, give him a call at 279-0844. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego guitarist Hank Easton hasn't been signed by a major label yet, but 
his self-produced CD, "San Diego Sunset," has won favor from local jazz writers 
(not just this one) and airplay on KIFM. 
</P>
<P>
Easton jammed with jazz celebrity Bob James two weeks ago at the San Diego 
Hilton. James was in town for a vacation, and Easton was sitting in with San 
Diego band Real to Reel. James joined the group for a version of his theme from 
the television show "Taxi." 
</P>
<P>
Easton and his band play tonight from 6 to 11 at the Mission Bay Hilton and 
Saturday from 5:30 to 7:30 at the Coronado Ferry Landing. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Pianist Rob Schneiderman, appearing with saxophonist Jimmy Heath at 
Elario's, has a busy career of his own. A new album with drummer Billy Higgins 
and bassist Rufus Reid is due this fall. Drummer Sherman Ferguson is taking the 
place of John Guerin in the second and final week of Heath's stay that ends 
Sunday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Legendary guitarist Barney Kessel, who now calls San Diego home, may sign with 
local management group Brady &amp; Associates. Longtime KSDS-FM (88.3) disc 
jockey Tony Sidotti, who recently went to work with Brady, is working on 
cementing a deal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dick Braun and his Orchestra play Chula Vista's Music in the Park summer music 
seres at 4:30 p.m. Sunday in Friendship Park, behind the public library (365 F 
St.). . . . 
</P>
<P>
This Saturday night's edition of "Club Date," the jazz show on KPBS-TV, 
features singer Anita O'Day, backed by locals Bob Magnusson on bass, Randy 
Porter on piano and Jim Plank on drums. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most Valuable Players plays light jazz at the B St. Cafe tonight through 
Saturday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fattburger plays the "Jazz Nite" at the Catamaran Resort Hotel next Wednesday.

COOK IT LIGHT: DO-AHEAD POTATO DISH IS NO-FUSS CHOICE FOR PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When you want to get everything ready ahead of time, such as before a weekend 
party, my potato recipe is the perfect choice. These Make-Ahead Potatoes are 
first baked, then scooped out of their shells and seasoned, stuffed back in, 
wrapped and refrigerated until just before you need them. Simply allow them to 
return to room temperature, unwrap and place under the broiler for a few 
minutes, until they are hot and ready to serve. 
</P>
<P>
MAKE-AHEAD POTATOES 
</P>
<P>
3 large baking potatoes 
</P>
<P>
Canola oil 
</P>
<P>
1 medium onion, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons corn-oil margarine 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup non-fat milk 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke 
</P>
<P>
6 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
Paprika, optional 
</P>
<P>
Thoroughly scrub potatoes. Dry with paper towels. Rub skin of each potato with 
canola oil. 
</P>
<P>
Cut each potato in half lengthwise and evenly divide onion slices between 6 
potato halves. Put each potato back together, enclosing onion slices between 
halves and wrap tightly with aluminum foil. Place potatoes in baking dish or on 
baking sheet, place in center of oven and bake at 400 degrees 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
Remove potatoes from oven and unwrap. Remove onions and place in large mixing 
bowl. Scoop out cooked pulp from each potato half, being careful not to tear 
skins, then add pulp to onion. Reserve 6 potato skins. 
</P>
<P>
Add margarine to potatoes and onions. Combine milk with salt, pepper and liquid 
smoke. Mix well and add to potato mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Using electric mixer or potato masher, whip potato mixture until thoroughly 
mixed and smooth in texture. Divide potato mixture evenly between 6 reserved 
skins and, if making ahead, re-wrap in foil and refrigerate until 1 hour prior 
to serving. 
</P>
<P>
To serve, unwrap potatoes and sprinkle 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese on top of 
each potato half. Sprinkle with paprika. Place potato halves under broiler 
until warm and lightly browned.Makes 6 servings.

 Each serving contains approximately 244 calories; 4 mg cholesterol; 6 gm fat; 
454 mg sodium.

Imagine going through final exams and graduation on the same day. Thirteen 
spring graduates of the three-quarter-long Culinary Arts Professional Program, 
through UCLA Extension, did just that. They toughed out their finals in the 
kitchen at Orleans restaurant. The results -- a six-course meal for 60 -- were 
served to their families, friends and teachers at the graduation ceremony held 
in the restaurant's upstairs dining room. Of course, they wore crisp chef's 
whites and baseball hats, rather than gowns and graduation caps.

together and form little balls. Do not overprocess. 
</P>
<P>
Wrap dough in plastic wrap and shape into 2 disks. Chill 2 to 3 hours before 
using for more tender crust and easier handling. 
</P>
<P>
Roll out each dough disk on lightly floured board to 1/8-inch thickness, 
working from center out. Line 2 (7-inch) tart pans with removable bottoms by 
loosely rolling dough around rolling pin, then unrolling dough over pan and 
pressing evenly into bottom and up sides, extending about 1/2 inch. Trim any 
excess dough and crimp edges. 
</P>
<P>
Bake shells at 375 degrees 15 to 20 minutes or until golden. Makes 2 (7-inch)

diameter) with pastry bag using large plain tip into trays lined with parchment 
paper. Chill just until firm. 
</P>
<P>
Stick 2 mounds together to form ball. Repeat with remaining mounds. Roll each

WAR ON CANCER BEING WAGED ON DIETARY FRONT; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: RESEARCHERS ARE NOW LOOKING AT FOODS THAT MIGHT DESTROY CARCINOGENS OR 
AT LEAST PROTECT THE BODY FROM THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Doctors aren't writing grocery lists on prescription blanks, and no one is 
advising: "Take two cabbages and call me in the morning." But a major effort is 
now under way in the United States -- with tantalizing early results -- to 
determine whether if certain foods can protect us from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Already a variety of fruits and vegetables and hundreds of chemicals in them 
have been identified as possible shields against various kinds of cancer: 
</P>
<P>
Vitamins A, C and E. 
</P>
<P>
Beta carotene, the coloring agent in carrots, and other carotenoids. 
</P>
<P>
Sulfur compounds. 
</P>
<P>
Selenium and calcium. 
</P>
<P>
Flavonoids, indoles, coumarins and a lot of other multisyllabic chemicals found 
in plants. 
</P>
<P>
"I liken this to where we were with cigarettes and lung cancer 20 years ago. We 
didn't know for sure, but there was a lot of circumstantial evidence," says Dr. 
Sherman Gorbach, cancer researcher and professor of community health and 
medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"The preponderance of evidence, in cancer, favors a change in diet," he says. 
In Japan, for instance, where the breast cancer rate is low, women eat twice 
the fiber we do and have only 22% or 23% of their calories in fat. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are really serious about preventing breast cancer," Gorbach advises, 
"you have to reduce fats below 25% of calories and increase your fiber." 
</P>
<P>
He says that the fiber should come from soybeans and rye, which have components 
that block the cancer-causing effect of estrogen on breast cells; from 
crucifers such as cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli, which most experts believe 
may have protective qualities; and from fruits and vegetables high in 
beta-carotene and Vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know which ones are best, so we recommend mixed fiber sources," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he is more definite than many others. 
</P>
<P>
At the National Cancer Institute's Diet and Cancer branch, the attitude is also 
wait-and-see. There, Herbert Pierson, Ph.D., heads a study of the 
cancer-fighting ability of garlic, citrus, licorice root, flaxseed and 
"umbelliferous" vegetables such as carrots, parsnips and parsley -- so-called 
because they have umbrella-shaped flowers. 
</P>
<P>
His project aims ultimately at collaboration with food manufacturers in the 
development of "designer foods," processed foods enhanced with protective 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
For the present, however, Pierson is cautious: 
</P>
<P>
"The epidemiological data suggest that adding fruits, vegetables, grains and 
spices to the diet has a beneficial effect," he says. "But most investigators 
don't want to commit themselves until the hard scientific data are all in 
place." 
</P>
<P>
There is reason for the wariness. So far, the evidence comes from population 
studies, like the fat-and-fiber data from Japan, or the study of garlic 
consumption in China that shows less stomach cancer in places where people eat 
a lot of garlic. 
</P>
<P>
Whether that information really establishes cause and effect and whether it can 
be applied in the United States -- where food habits, lifestyle, environmental 
conditions and ethnic make-up are different -- is still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Animal studies are similarly inconclusive. The effect of massive doses of 
suspected anti-carcinogens in short-lived mice may be entirely different from 
the effect of smaller doses in long-lived humans. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the pathways by which the presumed anti-cancer foodstuffs work have, 
however, been decoded. It's believed that one group of protective factors, 
known as anti-oxidants, clears away potentially harmful waste products. Others 
prevent carcinogens from attaching to particular kinds of cells. And still 
others make the body produce extra quantities of powerful enzymes that 
deactivate certain carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
But it is possible that those extra enzymes could also increase the effect of 
other carcinogens. Even the much-touted crucifers -- vegetables like cabbage, 
cauliflower, broccoli and bok choy -- could, therefore, have a downside, 
because they contain factors with the enzyme-boosting effect. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, major dietary changes, aimed at cancer prevention, could affect other 
areas of health and nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
A high-fiber diet, for example, is widely recommended because its indigestible 
bulk is thought to sweep wastes out fast enough to prevent carcinogenic 
contamination of the colon. Fiber also might sweep away some natural estrogenic 
compounds believed to be associated with initiation or spread of breast cancer, 
Gorbach says. 
</P>
<P>
But fiber in the gut also tangles with dietary minerals, preventing absorption 
of necessary nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
And while low-fat is desirable, no-fat is dangerous; the body needs some for 
normal function. Besides, fat is the dietary source of vitamins A and E, both 
of which are in the protective category because of their anti-oxidant activity. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the data supporting the probability of food-borne cancer fighters 
has been mounting for decades, and has encouraged increasingly sophisticated 
research. 
</P>
<P>
At the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Dr. Gary Gordon, assistant professor 
of oncology, and Dr. Paul Talalay, professor of molecular pharmacology, have 
been measuring the ability of compounds derived from broccoli to increase 
enzymes that detoxify carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
"Multiple factors from crucifers do it," Talalay says. And what he's found is 
that they do it better when the broccoli is fresher. "It does lose its charm 
when it's been around for a while," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The broccoli in the supermarket bin might, therefore, not be fresh enough to 
provide those good factors. The broccoli in the bag in the freezer might, or 
might not, have been frozen fast enough either. "We've had no decent way of 
assessing the anti-cancer properties" of commercially available broccoli, 
Talalay says. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can he tell us yet whether to eat it raw or cooked, steamed or microwaved, 
with stems or without. "What's relevant for the housewife?" he asks. "I can't 
tell you." 
</P>
<P>
At the Institute for Hormone Research in New York City, Dr. Jon J. Michnovicz 
and H. Leon Bradlow, Ph.D., have focused on just one particular factor from 
crucifers -- a chemical known as indole-3-carbinol, or IC. 
</P>
<P>
"We know it prevents mammary tumors in mice," Michnovicz says. 
</P>
<P>
Although populations that consume a lot of crucifers have fewer cases of breast 
cancer, no one knows for sure whether IC is as protective in mankind as it is 
in mice. 
</P>
<P>
Michnovicz and Bradlow have brought us one step closer to the answer by giving 
IC to people, and in both men and women, they have found a dramatic increase in 
production of an enzyme that deactivates a form of estrogen associated with 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a possible kicker in this. 
</P>
<P>
Michnovicz says that if you give animals a whopping dose of certain other 
carcinogens, and then give IC, they may be more susceptible to tumor formation. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Hendrick, Ph.D., of the University of Iowa and a principal investigator 
in an NCI animal study of possible anti-carcinogenic nutrients, focuses on the 
crucifer connection in another way. She's measuring the activity of crucifers 
high in indoles vs. the crucifers high in a group of anti-oxidant compounds 
known as "dithiolathiones." 
</P>
<P>
But that will not tell the whole story either. Crucifers also contain Vitamin 
C, another known anti-oxidant. Vitamin C is one of the reasons NCI is 
interested in citrus, which also contains such possible anti-carcinogens as 
flavonoids, limonoids and coumarins. 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli and kale, in the crucifer group, are also especially high in an 
anti-oxidant known as beta carotene. Best known for its pigmenting effect in 
orange-colored foods such as carrots, beta carotene's effectiveness in 
population and animal studies has brought it to the point of NCI-sponsored 
trials in human beings. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that when you are eating a food, you're eating all the components 
in it," Hendrick says. And that has implications both good and bad. 
</P>
<P>
"The stage we're in now is the more we learn, the more complicated it gets. We 
don't want to push people to eat something that 10 years down the line causes 
more problems than it cures."

COOL AND QUICK SALADS FOR SUMMER; 
</P>
<P>
DINING: MAKE-AHEAD SALADS ARE THE PERFECT WARM-WEATHER ENTREES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the weather is hot, the kitchen is hot, so use the cooler evening weather 
to your advantage and do most of the preparation for dinner the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Make-ahead salads are a perfect choice. They're delicious, crunchy and 
tempting. Best of all, they are easy to prepare and so satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Take Chicken Salad Ring, for example. It's party-pretty and delicious enough to 
put in the gourmet class. While some chicken salads are too pallid to be 
interesting, this salad ring has a real zesty personality all its own, thanks 
to crushed crackers, crushed pineapple and chopped pecans. It's a hearty 
main-dish salad, perfect to serve for lunch or dinner during the warm summer 
months. Just add rolls, iced tea or coffee and fruit and the meal is complete. 
</P>
<P>
And, not only is this salad cool to eat, it's also cool to prepare if you make 
it ahead and let the flavors mingle all day. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other suggestions that follow may seem a little intimidating, but 
there's nothing quite like the elegance of an unmolded dish presented on a 
gorgeous platter. Armed with a few tips, even the novice cook can prepare 
molded salads with confidence and good results. 
</P>
<P>
Molds are simply containers that have been specially designed to shape food. 
They are often made of tin-lined copper, stainless steel, porcelain or 
earthenware and may be ring-shaped, square, rectangular or shaped like an 
animal (usually a fish or lobster) or a fruit (quite often a pineapple). 
</P>
<P>
As a rule, food with considerable texture is prepared in a relatively plain 
mold, while smoother-textured food is considered more appropriate for 
decorative molds with ribs, swirls or detailed shapes. 
</P>
<P>
A good molded recipe for hesitant cooks is Chicken Loaf Aspic, a layer of 
flavorful congealed chicken crowned with another layer of spicy tomato aspic. 
Although the two layers give it an impressive appearance, this recipe is 
actually quite simple to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
First, the aspic layer is made by sprinkling unflavored gelatin over vegetable 
cocktail juice. As the mixture heats in a saucepan, the gelatin slowly 
dissolves. Horseradish is added for flavoring and the tomato aspic is ready to 
be poured into the mold. For easier unmolding later, brush the inside of the 
mold with a bit of oil first. 
</P>
<P>
While the aspic chills, the chicken layer is prepared. This time, the gelatin 
is dissolved in canned chicken broth, then heated in a saucepan. The broth is 
then chilled until slightly thick; a mixture of finely chopped chunk chicken, 
sour cream, shredded carrot, chopped green onions and horseradish is folded 
into the broth. The thickened chicken layer is spooned onto the aspic layer to 
chill at least four hours. 
</P>
<P>
To unmold when thoroughly chilled, remove from the refrigerator and run a knife 
or metal spatula around the edges of the mold, then dip the bottom of the mold 
into a shallow pan of hot water several times to loosen this area. Take a 
chilled serving platter and place it over the open side of the mold. Hold 
platter and mold tightly together and invert. When you lift the mold, the food 
should remain on the platter. Some recommend returning the molded dish to the 
refrigerator to firm up after this process. 
</P>
<P>
Other simple molds are Pineapple-Cheese Chicken Mold and Molded Salad 
Primavera. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Iraq's powerful army claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of this 
small, oil-rich kingdom. Tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and 
government buildings, and the emir fled to Saudi Arabia, Kuwaiti officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all government buildings in 
the capital and were moving south toward the country's oil facilities. He 
appealed for U.S. military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait!" a Kuwaiti government official shouted 
in a telephone interview. Diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf estimated that 
more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein claimed that it invaded at the 
request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established "the 
provisional government of free Kuwait." Kuwait and U.N. diplomats labeled the 
coup report a farce. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad television said Iraq could withdraw its forces within days or weeks, 
depending on how quickly the situation stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
The assault followed two weeks of tension between Kuwait and Iraq, caused by 
Iraqi accusations that Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area. Saddam 
also accused Kuwait of exceeding OPEC production quotas, thus driving down the 
price of oil, a major Iraqi revenue source. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, diplomats said Iraq had massed more than 100,000 troops at the 
border. Kuwait's entire armed forces has 20,300 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in modern history that an Arab nation had invaded another 
and taken over its government. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's army was no match for Iraq, battle-hardened after eight years of war 
with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a few hours after 
crossing the border 40 miles away at dawn. Witnesses said the bombardment of 
ports and military airports by artillery and the air force was vicious. 
</P>
<P>
The invaders surrounded the palace of Kuwait's ruler, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al 
Sabah. Residents said the palace was seized after about two hours of heavy 
artillery barrages. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Sheik Fahd al Ahmed al Sabah, one of the emir's brothers, was 
killed while trying to defend the palace. 
</P>
<P>
There were about 50 tanks around the palace and the neighboring American 
Embassy, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
The al Sabah family has ruled the city-state for almost 250 years. The Kuwaiti 
ambassador said the leaders were safe in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Operating from an unknown location, al Ahmed's government responded to the 
formation of the provisional government by stating: "Kuwait is Kuwait to its 
people, led by the emir, Sheik Jabbar, and his Crown Prince Sheik Saad. God 
preserve them from all harm." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the provisional government announced through Baghdad's official 
Iraqi News Agency that it was dissolving Parliament and would hold "free and 
honest elections" at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's land and sea borders were closed, as was the airport.

2 STEAL $11,000 IN LOTTO SCAM

<P>
An elderly Bellflower man lost $11,000 to a woman who promised to sell him a 
jackpot-winning Lotto ticket but instead took his money and disappeared with an 
accomplice, leaving him with a worthless ticket, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Tafoya, 82, withdrew $11,000 from two banks to buy a part-interest in 
what he thought was a winning Lotto ticket, Sgt. Larry Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwell said a woman approached Tafoya about 3 p.m. Tuesday in a supermarket 
parking lot and confided that she had won the jackpot in last Saturday's Lotto 
drawing, but that because she was in the country illegally, she could not cash 
her ticket. Tafoya and another man, who deputies believe was an accomplice, 
reportedly agreed to buy the ticket as partners. The other man withdrew what 
appeared to be $14,000 from a bank and accompanied Tafoya to two separate 
banks, where he withdrew a total of $11,000, Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, both the woman and the suspected accomplice disappeared, Blackwell 
said, leaving Tafoya with a worthless Lotto ticket. Deputies said they had no 
suspects.

Communist guerrillas freed a kidnaped U.S. Peace Corps volunteer and a Japanese 
rural technician today after 50 and 65 days in captivity, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Swanson, 27, of Cheyenne, Wyo., was turned over to representatives of 
the International Red Cross in his Patag village home in the mountainous 
municipality of Silay on Negros Island, 300 miles south of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really glad to be out. I'm very tired; I'm going to pass out," Swanson 
said during turnover ceremonies at a rebel campfire. He said the rebels were 
"very good" to him. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson was flown to Manila later in the day. He was expected to return shortly 
to Cheyenne after a medical examination, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell him it's about time he got home," his mother, Lynne Swanson, said on 
hearing in Wyoming that her son had been released. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Leonard, said, "I don't know exactly what we'll tell him when when 
we see him, but for sure we will tell him we love him. We'll be so happy to see 
him, out of danger and home." 
</P>
<P>
Negros Gov. Daniel Lacson said Swanson's release was delayed because of the 
rugged terrain and failure by the negotiators to locate the appointed place for 
the release. But he said that before nightfall, the guerrillas came down from 
the hills with Swanson to turn him over to civilian negotiators.

Earlier today, the guerrillas of the Communist New People's Army turned over 
Fumio Mizuno, 36, to his Filipina wife and two children at a sugar plantation 
on the outskirts of nearby Murcia. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson and Mizuno, who appeared tired but otherwise in good shape, were 
examined by representatives of the Red Cross and doctors before the rebels 
released them. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson was kidnaped June 13 from Silay. On June 27, Washington ordered the 
suspension of the 29-year-old Peace Corps program in the Philippines and 
recalled its 261 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension was prompted by reports the NPA planned to kill or kidnap the 
volunteers in an escalation of its terrorist drive against Americans to press 
demands for the withdrawal of U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
Mizuno is training director of a Tokyo-based private aid group called 
Organization for Industrial, Spiritual and Cultural Advancement.

<TEXT>
<P>
Foreigners living in Kuwait said they watched from their windows or dived for 
cover when Iraq staged a lightning invasion of Kuwait today. 
</P>
<P>
Reached by telephone from Bahrain, the expatriates told of hearing gunfire, 
explosions and jets and helicopters overhead as the Iraqi troops moved in 
before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," said Catherine Baker, 37, of Illinois, who works for a British 
design firm in the small, oil-rich nation. "It doesn't seem real." 
</P>
<P>
There are about 4,000 Americans among the large expatriate community in Kuwait, 
where more than 60% of the 1.8 million residents are foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said she was shocked by the suddenness of the Iraqi strike, although 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had made threats against Kuwait in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We were totally unprepared," she said. "One feels like there should have been 
a bit of warning." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the British Embassy was hit by shellfire and that the Sheraton 
and Hilton hotels evacuated their clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy McGregor, 32, a Canadian, said one explosion was close enough to shake 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
"You know when you see a movie, when people dive for cover? We did it. The 
explosion blew inside the house, shaking it." 
</P>
<P>
"It's chaos, military jets are flying over all the time," McGregor said by 
telephone early today as she watched from her window. But in the afternoon, she 
said things had quieted down considerably. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not much noise or gunfire. I feel better with more people around 
now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some expatriates said they did not want to leave despite the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be over soon somehow," said Serge Sejournet, 30, an artist 
from Paris. "I don't think I want to get out of Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Sejournet said the Iraqi soldiers on the street in front of his home in 
downtown Kuwait were "very friendly with everyone, saying hello to all." 
</P>
<P>
Sejournet, Baker and other expatriates said they gathered together in homes of 
friends, listening to the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Anxious friends and relatives of those living in Kuwait found it difficult or 
impossible to get in touch with them. In Washington, a spokesman for AT&amp;T 
said calls to Kuwait reached 2,000 every five minutes. The spokesman, Herb 
Linnen, said only some of the calls were getting through and that there were 
long delays because of the heavy volume. 
</P>
<P>
Linnen said the company itself had managed to get only one call through to its 
employees in Kuwait today and ascertained that its several dozen employees and 
their families were safe. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T employees in Kuwait include Americans, Canadians, British, Filipinos 
and one Sri Lankan who have been working on a project with the Kuwaiti 
government to improve communications, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department, meanwhile, set up a 24-hour hot line for people seeking 
information about the safety of American relatives and friends in Kuwait and 
Iraq. The number is (202) 647-0900.

IRAQ-KUWAIT: WORLD REACTION 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Union: After a meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Siberia, Iraq's main supplier of 
arms suspended delivery of all military equipment and called for an immediate 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Israel: Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman said the invasion confirms 
Israeli warnings that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's war threats should be 
taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Britain: London joined the United States in freezing Kuwaiti assets to prevent 
Iraq from seizing them. 
</P>
<P>
United Nations: In a rare pre-dawn emergency session in New York, the body 
swiftly condemned the invasion and demanded Iraq's immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
France: Iraq's second-largest arms supplier issued a "total and unreserved 
condemnation" and demanded an immediate pullout. 
</P>
<P>
China: A "deeply concerned" Beijing appealed for an immediate halt to military 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Japan: The Foreign Ministry called the invasion "extremely regrettable." Tokyo 
depends on Persian Gulf crude oil for 70% of its petroleum needs. 
</P>
<P>
Arab League: An emergency session was convened to consider a response. Only 
Lebanon immediately condemned the invasion.

Scores of detectives and hundreds of police officers spread out across the city 
in anticipation of a fifth attack by the Zodiac killer this morning, but the 
astrology-obsessed gunman did not strike. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-dawn hours of today were considered a target night for the gunman, 
based on his pattern of striking on early Thursdays at 21-day intervals or 
multiples thereof. 
</P>
<P>
Today marked 42 days since the gunman's attack on a homeless man sleeping on a 
Central Park bench. It is also in the sign of Leo, believed to be the 
astrological sign of the gunman's next victim. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman has sent six letters to police and the media, threatening to kill 12 
people, one for each astrological sign.

EUROPE FIRM TO BUY FIREMAN'S FUND INSURANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
Allianz AG, Europe's largest insurance company, has signed an agreement to 
purchase Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. for $3.3 billion in cash, it was 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Fireman's Fund Insurance is the principal subsidiary of Greenwich-based Fund 
American Cos. 
</P>
<P>
It had gross premiums in 1989 totaling $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a perfect match," Jack Byrne, chairman of both Fireman's Fund and Fund 
American, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the total transaction, Allianz will acquire 100% of Fireman's Fund 
Insurance stock and Fund American will purchase the common stock portfolio of 
Fireman's Fund Insurance for about $2.2 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, when the transaction is closed, Fund American will repurchase all 
300,000 shares of convertible preferred stock of Fund American now owned by 
IFINT SA, a Luxembourg corporation, for $434 million in cash plus unpaid 
dividends. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction, which is subject to approval by insurance and other regulatory 
authorities and Fund American stockholders, is expected to be completed early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we can add value to (Fireman's Fund Insurance) through our 
international capabilities, but any advances would come carefully and slowly," 
said Wolfgang Muller, a member of the board of management of Allianz AG. "We 
have been looking for a long time and we have finally found the right fit and 
the best companion." 
</P>
<P>
Fireman's Fund, headquartered in Novato, Calif., was founded in 1863. In 1968, 
it was acquired by American Express Co., and in 1985 it became an independent 
company during what was then the largest initial public offering in the history 
of the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Allianz, with a worldwide premium value in 1989 of $20 billion, has 223 
subsidiaries in 45 countries.

THE POLITICS OF OIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq and Kuwait produce one-fifth of the total oil output of the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
</P>
<P>
Their oil accounts for an estimated 5% of daily U.S. consumption: the United 
States buys about 200,000 barrels of oil daily from Kuwait and 500,000 to 
600,000 barrels from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1990, OPEC produced about 23.5 million barrels of crude 
oil per day; world production outside the Soviet Union and its former 
satellites was about 52 million barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is one of the major producers of the 13-member cartel, with a daily 
production quota of 3.14 million barrels. That equals Iran's quota and is 
second only to Saudi Arabia's 5.1 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's quota is 1.5 million barrels per day out of an estimated production 
capacity of 2.2 million to 2.5 million barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 1990, the United States imported 49.9% of its oil. 
It produced 7.3 million barrels a day, the lowest in 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's huge oil reserves are backed by one of the largest financial reserves 
in the world. It has more than $100 billion in surplus petrodollars, mostly 
invested in the United States, Britain, West Germany, France and other 
industrialized countries.

<P>
Japan, despite running huge annual trade surpluses, still shelters a wide range 
of farm products and some industrial goods from foreign competition, the world 
commerce watchdog GATT said today. 
</P>
<P>
While Tokyo has made tangible progress in opening its markets in recent years, 
a hard core of high protection remains, a review of Japanese trade policies by 
the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said. 
</P>
<P>
Rice is the most deep-rooted example among farm products, with imports 
virtually banned to keep the country self-sufficient in this staple, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tariff duties on sugar, beverages, liquor and dairy products were higher than 
the average rate of 12.1% for agricultural imports, and some dairy and fish 
products were subject to import quotas. 
</P>
<P>
Although industrial tariffs were generally low, averaging 5.3% in 1989, many 
goods of particular export interest to developing countries faced duties as 
high as 60%.

Chrysler Corp. officially announced today that tentative retail prices on its 
domestically built 1991 model cars will rise an average 0.9% from final 1990 
prices, although its redesigned minivans could rise as much as 3.8% when 
compared with similarly equipped 1990 versions. 
</P>
<P>
But a base-to-base price comparison of similarly equipped models shows 
Chrysler's new car prices could rise an average of 1.3% overall, with price 
cuts placed on some of its slower-selling car lines such as the Dodge Monaco 
and LeBaron coupe to spur their sales, Chrysler Motors Chairman Bennett E. 
Bidwell said during an informal press briefing. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on its aging Jeep Cherokee have tentatively been reduced by an average 
4.4%, in answer to increased competition in the four-door sport utility vehicle 
market from new models like Ford Motor Co.'s Explorer, Bidwell said.

</P>
<P>
The concert by the English Chamber Orchestra, and a recording to be released by 
EMI, benefit the prince's charity, The Prince's Trust. The trust helps 
disadvantaged young people.

Charles commissioned one of the works by composer Patrick Doyle especially for 
his grandmother. The piece has a series of Scottish verses set to music and was 
sung by Scottish soprano Marie McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the guest of honor, the prince invited his mother, Queen Elizabeth II; 
his wife, Princess Diana, and about 300 others.

LIZ SMITH: ITALY WOWED BY PRINCE'S SECURITY, NOT HIS SHOW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MADONNA, THAT ambitious blonde, isn't the only rock star touring Europe who 
didn't bowl over Italy. Prince, who is hoping to wow the world with his new 
"Graffiti Bridge" album and film, did not exactly set Rome on fire, either. 
There were plenty of empty seats at his concert, but that's not what had the 
cognoscenti buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
No, what really amused the Italians was that Prince was surrounded by more 
security than anyone in Italy has ever seen. The hotel where Prince reigned was 
literally an armed camp of security men and bodyguards. What they were 
protecting Prince from was something of a mystery since there was not a single 
fan waiting for him outside the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
So what is it with all these bodyguards? Are stars really so afraid of being 
molested by their fans -- or those who are not their fans -- or is this simply 
part of the show, a necessary adjunct of being a superstar? 
</P>
<P>
Madonna's muscular security guys, who double as her jogging partners, were not 
favorites of the British recently, as they shoved reporters and photographers 
aside to make a path for the fanatically athletic star. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Eddie Murphy who most likely gets top honors in the bodyguard 
sweepstakes. At the opening of Spike Lee's "Mo' Better Blues" the other night, 
Murphy, whose appeal to moviegoers seems a bit on the wane, appeared with five 
times the security the mayor of New York had. 
</P>
<P>
TINA TURNER'S "Foreign Affair" concert tour of Europe has been extended for 10 
more weeks. Tina, who has more energy, stamina and sex appeal than women half 
her age, has been absolutely killing them on the Continent. She has probably 
played to the largest crowds, in the biggest arenas, in more cities than any 
other female performer. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Tina went on before 65,000 screaming fans at Woburn Abbey outside 
London last week, she was visited backstage by one very special fan -- a 
charmingly dressed down Princess Diana. Afterward, the Princess of Wales and 
her party stayed for the entire two-hour performance, watching from the 
lighting platform in the middle -- and above -- the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
BARBRA STREISAND is a woman who knows what she likes, and she wants what she 
likes right away. Just ask the delighted proprietors of the Rhett Gallery in 
Beaufort, S.C., where La Streisand is in the midst of her "Prince of Tides" 
film. 
</P>
<P>
The star, who has a fine eye for art, intended only a brief drop-in at the 
gallery. It turned into a two-hour visit. Barbra purchased at least 14 works 
that will eventually find their way to the actress's East and West Coast 
residences.

He donated $55,000 to give Reuben the chimp new digs.

Northeast Nebraska Zoo has only one chimpanzee, but the donation from "The

well as build a permanent primate exhibit, zoo officials said.

The 7-year-old chimp is housed in a fortified mobile home at the zoo in rural

Construction should begin next week on a new enclosure.

convent is being leased for 20 cents a year from church officials who wished to 
remain anonymous, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The windfall came last November when Winfrey held a benefit performance in 
Minneapolis and offered to give half of the proceeds to the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Ajax said the donation was so large that it took several months for the shelter 
to find other sources to match it.

Darryl Strawberry broke out of a slump with a two-run homer and an RBI single 
and Frank Viola became the first National League pitcher to win 15 games as the 
New York Mets beat the Montreal Expos 5-1 today. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry, who was 0-for-18, snapped a 1-1 tie with a run-scoring single off 
Dennis Martinez (7-8) during a two-run sixth inning, then slammed his 26th 
homer in a three-run eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Viola (15-5) allowed six hits, struck out seven and walked one in pitching his 
sixth complete game for the East Division-leading Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Johnson began New York's rally in the sixth with a one-out single 
against Martinez, who had blanked the Mets on three hits over the first five 
innings. Johnson stole second as Dave Magadan struck out. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Jefferies then drove in Johnson with a triple before Strawberry singled, 
making it 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McReynolds also homered for the Mets in the eighth.

Philadelphia Phillies Manager Nick Leyva and General Manager Lee Thomas have 
received contract extensions through the 1992 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The team did not disclose financial details of either contract, but The 
Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Leyva's was worth $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Phillies President Bill Giles said he was extremely pleased with Thomas, who 
initiated a wholesale reorganization of the franchise after coming to 
Philadelphia in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas took over a last-place team that won 65 games in 1988 and 67 last year. 
Through trades, free agent signings and development of a few players from a 
very thin farm system, the Phillies are playing .500 baseball this season and 
are only nine games out of first in the NL East. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited because I know that soon this club is going to be a very good 
club," Leyva said.

MURPHY CLEARS WAIVERS, MAY GO TO PHILLIES

Atlanta Braves outfielder Dale Murphy has cleared major league waivers for a 
possible trade to the Philadelphia Phillies, but the veteran slugger said 
there's a lot of talking to be done before he agrees to a deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't talked contract yet. 
</P>
<P>
No firm decisions have been made," Murphy said. He is in the final year of a 
three-year contract and could become a free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
As a veteran of more than 10 years who has been with the same team for more 
than five years, Murphy has veto power over any trade. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some discussions that have taken place. A lot of things have to be 
weighed. I really couldn't tell you when something might happen," the Atlanta 
Constitution quoted Murphy as saying in Houston, where the Braves open a series 
with the Astros today. 
</P>
<P>
The trade talk says Murphy would go to Philadelphia for right-handed reliever 
Jeff Parrett and a second player. 
</P>
<P>
Phillies General Manager Lee Thomas confirmed that such a trade has been 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
If completed, it would end a 14-year relationship between Atlanta and possibly 
its best-loved athlete of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Parrett also cleared major league waivers Wednesday afternoon. Had any other 
team claimed either player, the trade would have been off. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 34, joined the Braves in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
He is a two-time National League most valuable player and a seven-time 
All-Star.

TROUBADOR, LOBELL FAVORED IN $1.34-MILLION N.J. RACE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Royal Troubador, last year's 2-year-old trotting colt of the year, and Embassy 
Lobell, another star in Lou Guida's stable, have been named early favorites for 
the two divisions of Saturday's $1.34-million Hambletonian. 
</P>
<P>
Ten horses were entered in each of the divisions of the most prestigious 
trotting event in harness racing, and both Royal Troubador and Embassy Lobell 
drew favorable post positions for the highlight of the Meadowlands Racetrack 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Embassy Lobell, who will be looking to give Guida his third Hambletonian winner 
in four years, drew the No. 4 post position in the first division, while Royal 
Troubador, the winner of the Yonkers Trot, drew the inside No. 1 post in the 
second division. 
</P>
<P>
The top five finishers in each division will return for a third heat. If that 
race is won by either of the winners of the opening two divisions, then that 
horse is the Hambletonian winner. If a third horse wins the third division, 
then the three winners compete in one more race, with the winner capturing the 
Hambletonian. 
</P>
<P>
Embassy Lobell, who is the 8-5 favorite in his division, scored an impressive 
victory in capturing the $401,500 Budweiser Beacon Course Trot here last 
weekend, winning in a lifetime best performance of 1:56 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying he's going to win the Hambletonian, but he should be good 
competition," driver Mike Lachance said. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Troubador has started just six times this year, winning two, finishing 
second twice, and third twice for Carl Allen, the colt's breeder, owner, 
trainer and driver. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Troubador's wins have been big ones, coming in the Dexter Cup and the 
Yonkers Trot, the first leg of the trotting Triple Crown where Royal Troubador 
was a length the better of King of the Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Royal Troubador draw well for Allen, but so did Jeanne's Somolli, 
who drew the inside rail post position in the first heat. The colt will be 
driven by Rod Allen, Carl Allen's son. 
</P>
<P>
"This could not have been any better," Carl Allen said after the draw. "Things 
are falling in line. There will be a lot of prayers between now and Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne's Somolli, who won an elimination in the Beacon, is the 6-1 third choice 
in the opening division of the Hambletonian. Armbro Iliad is the 5-1 second 
choice with Ron Waples. 
</P>
<P>
The field for the opening division with horse, driver and odds is: 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne's Somolli, Rod Allen, 6-1; Remus Hanover, John Simpson Jr., 10-1; 
Backstreet Guy, Ben Webster, 12-1; Embassy Lobell, Lachance, 8-5; Meadowbranch 
Eddy, Per Erikkson, 8-1; The Devil, Lorenzo Baldi, 15-1; Crown Bones, Berndt 
Lindstedt, 5-1; Roughing It, no driver announced, 30-1; Armbro Iliad, Ron 
Waples, 5-1, and I'm Impeccable, Lachance also listed to drive, 30-1. 
</P>
<P>
The second division field is: 
</P>
<P>
Royal Troubador, Carl Allen, 5-2; Harmonious, John Campbell, 7-2; King of the 
Sea, Stanley Dancer, 8-1; Kosar, Per Henriksen, 4-1; Antwerp Hanover, Waples, 
15-1; Peddler Yorktowne, Mike Saftic, 30-1; Cheyenne Spur, Richard Stillings, 
8-1; Star Mystic, Jan Johnson, 9-2; Meadowbranch Elmer, Richard Silverman, 
40-1; and Grundy's Rambo, Jan Nordin, 15-1.

INJURED SUNDAY SILENCE IS RETIRED; 
</P>
<P>
RACING: THE DEPARTURE OF 1989'S HORSE OF THE YEAR DEALS ANOTHER SETBACK TO 
SATURDAY'S ARLINGTON CUP. WHEN THE DUST SETTLES, ONLY THREE HORSES REMAIN.

Sunday Silence, who earned 1989 Horse of the Year honors after three stirring 
victories over Easy Goer, was retired today because of a strained ligament in 
his left front foot. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best horse I've had in my lifetime, and I've had a lot of good ones," 
said Charlie Whittingham, Sunday Silence's trainer and co-owner with Arthur 
Hancock. "It's not a very bad problem, but with a horse of his caliber, you 
don't want to take a chance. He's done everything he can and we're going to let 
him retire in a dignified way." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence had been training for Saturday's Arlington Challenge Cup at 
Arlington Park when the injury occurred. The injury was diagnosed by Dr. Alex 
Harthill, who today detected "heat" in the foot of the 4-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham said there was no swelling in the leg and the horse is not lame. 
Sunday Silence will stand stud at Stone Farm in Paris, Ky., across the street 
from where rival Easy Goer is standing stud. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be able to shoot the bull for the rest of their lives," Whittingham 
said. "We'll get him to Kentucky in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a special feeling for Sunday Silence. He's got a great personality. 
There's not a bad race in his pedigree." 
</P>
<P>
With the loss of Sunday Silence, the Challenge Cup suffered another blow to 
what once was a stellar field. After the news of Sunday Silence hit, trainer D. 
Wayne Lukas, who last month withdrew Criminal Type from the event after Easy 
Goer was retired, said today he was withdrawing 1989 male grass champion 
Steinlen. Also today, Opening Verse was removed from the field because of a 
minor foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
The field for the Challenge Cup now stands at three -- Western Playboy, Beau 
Genius and Santangelo -- with the purse having been further reduced to 
$250,000. The original purse was $1 million, but when Easy Goer was retired, it 
dropped to $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence retires as the third-leading money winner of all time, with 
$4,968,554, behind Alysheba and John Henry. Sunday Silence won nine of 14 
career starts and finished second in the five other races. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Sunday Silence raced twice, winning the Californian Stakes on June 3 
at Hollywood Park and finishing second to Criminal Type in the Hollywood Gold 
Cup on June 24. 
</P>
<P>
His retirement follows the departure of Easy Goer, who retired July 18 because 
of bone chip to the right front sesamoid. The two were to meet for the first 
time as 4-year-olds in the Arlington Cup Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence will best be remembered for his thrilling battles with Easy Goer 
in the 1989 Triple Crown races. Sunday Silence won the Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness before Easy Goer took the Belmont to spoil Sunday Silence's Triple 
Crown hopes. But Sunday Silence avenged that defeat in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic at Gulfstream in November.

injury. He had a real good workout last week; he went six furlongs in 1:11 and 
change and galloped out a mile in 1:39. I wanted him to get tired and get 
something out of it. I'll probably blow him out a half (today)."

STEINBRENNER'S SON FACES HURDLES TO JOB; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HE MUST SURVIVE A SERIES OF VOTES TO SUCCEED HIS FATHER. AS FEW AS 
FOUR AL OWNERS COULD JOIN TO BLOCK THE APPOINTMENT.

<TEXT>
<P>
The path George Steinbrenner hopes to clear for his son to succeed him as 
general partner of the New York Yankees is not all that smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Steinbrenner, 33, is his father's choice to assume the role that must be 
filled by Aug. 20, in accordance with Commissioner Fay Vincent's ruling Monday 
that forces the senior Steinbrenner to relinquish control of the franchise as 
the penalty for paying $40,000 to a known gambler, Howard Spira. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent has agreed to approve the appointment of Hank Steinbrenner, but there 
are other hurdles Hank must overcome. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment must first be approved by a two-thirds vote of the Yankees' 
limited partners. Upon their approval, the matter would be brought to the major 
league ownership committee, an eight-member panel to which George Steinbrenner 
had belonged. After a committee review, the 25 other major league clubs would 
vote on the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
The requirements for passage are different in each league: In the National 
League, only a majority of votes (at least seven of the 12 clubs) is needed; in 
the American League, three-quarters (at least 10 of the 13 clubs other than the 
Yankees) must approve. As few as four nay votes in the American League would 
block the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
"People rush to conclusions, but it's not a foregone conclusion that Hank 
Steinbrenner will pass muster with the owners," one baseball official said. 
"The ordinary course is a stiff process. This is not an automatic process." 
</P>
<P>
Questions concerning Hank's qualifications for the job surely will arise. He 
worked for the Yankees on something of an intern basis in 1986. Since then, he 
has been the manager of the Kinsman Stud Farm, a 750-acre thoroughbred-breeding 
facility owned by his father. Hank lives on the Ocala, Fla., property with his 
wife, Joanie, and their daughter, Jaqueline. He would have to establish 
residence in New York City, which would be as simple as retaining a suite at a 
hotel. His father has done that the last few years at the Park Regency in 
Manhattan while maintaining the base of operations in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
With the Yankees, Hank sat in on meetings and worked closely with Woody 
Woodward, the general manager at the time, and special adviser Clyde King but 
had no official say in the organization. Among Hank's contributions, his father 
said, was the idea to name Willie Randolph and Ron Guidry co-captains. 
</P>
<P>
There was no word on when the limited partners would meet to discuss Hank's 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Said one limited partner, "We want to hear what Hank has to say and what he 
intends to do with the team. It's not going to be a rubber-stamp deal." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not, but George Steinbrenner may hold too many cards. He has 55% 
interest, and his wife, Joan, is believed to have 5%. That would leave a need 
of only 7% -- as little as two or three votes from the remaining 17 partners -- 
for approval. 
</P>
<P>
The ownership committee is chaired by Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox. 
Other members are the St. Louis Cardinals' Fred Kuhlmann, the Milwaukee 
Brewers' Bud Selig, the Chicago Cubs' Charles Brumbach, the Houston Astros' 
John McMullen, the Oakland Athletics' Walter Haas and the Dodgers' Peter 
O'Malley. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee will take an objective look," one member said. "In the last few 
situations, the committee worked hard to determine if the transfer of control 
was acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
It is the final vote of the clubs that will determine Hank Steinbrenner's fate. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia Phillies owner Bill Giles said he intends to keep an open mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Lack of baseball experience won't work against him," Giles said. "The key 
thing is who are the people they will be bringing in, the general manager, that 
sort of thing. I don't think we should decide for other owners who should be 
brought in as general manager. What we try to find out about a new owner is, 
'Does he have the common sense to hire the right people?' Who could advise us 
are those familiar with the situation and with the candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Among those familiar are King and Cincinnati Reds Manager Lou Piniella, the 
Yankee manager during Hank's brief tenure with the club. Both gave him glowing 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very dedicated young man," King said from his North Carolina home. 
"He's not real outgoing. He's very reserved. He won't volunteer opinions, but 
when he gives one he has the facts and the evidence to back it up. Those under 
him will work relaxed. He'll make the workers do their job better." 
</P>
<P>
"Hank is intelligent and gets along well with people," said Piniella, who was 
contacted in the visitors clubhouse at San Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium. "If I 
owned a club, Hank is the type of young man I'd want to run things. He's 
diligent. He listens to people. He has been involved in the baseball outskirts. 
I'm sure once he gets acclimated to the day-to-day operation of the Yankees, 
he'll do a terrific job." 
</P>
<P>
The question that remains is, will Hank Steinbrenner get that chance?

Never is the artist so naked. There he exposes more than his creative talents 
to the world; there he lays bare himself. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism that follows is about more than his art; it is of a time of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn Early, the third-year Charger receiver, painted his self-portrait last 
year. To look at him now at the end of a recent practice, lovingly holding his 
3 1/2-month-old son in his arms, it is hard to imagine he is the man depicted 
in his stark self-portrait. But he is. 
</P>
<P>
The black-and-white painting is of a football player, his face almost entirely 
hidden behind a dark shield across his helmet. His eyes are cannot be seen, if 
but the shield could be lifted, they would reveal a melancholy man. 
</P>
<P>
This was the Quinn Remar Early of last fall. A knee injury that twice required 
arthroscopic surgery limited him to six games and 11 catches. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real dark season for me," Early said. 
</P>
<P>
Only recently has he again begun to see the light. 
</P>
<P>
His first glimpse of hope came April 8 in the arrival of Quinn Cameron, his and 
wife Casandra's first child. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a great little guy," Early said. "He never cries. We take him 
everywhere, even to restaurants. The only time he cries is when his diaper is 
dirty or he's hungry or tired. The rest of the time he sits there and giggles." 
</P>
<P>
His second glimpse of hope came two weeks ago with the start of training camp 
at UC San Diego. That was when, for the first time since his second surgery 
seven months ago, Early said he felt and acted like a healthy player. 
</P>
<P>
"At mini-camp I wasn't sure how my leg was," Early said, "I still had that 
little twinge. But I worked really hard between then and camp to strengthen my 
legs. Once training camp started, I felt great." 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, he had his painting to rely on for inspiration and comfort. 
Early said he painted 30 or 40 pictures while he was rehabilitating his knee. 
Some of those works were displayed in 
</P>
<P>
a gallery in Bonita in February. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated not playing," Early said. "It was really hard on me, but on the good 
side, I had my wife and my art work." 
</P>
<P>
Early graduated from Iowa with a degree in commercial art, but his interest 
began 15 years earlier, with his older brother, Derrick. Derrick, 32, now has 
an art gallery in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"He has taught me everything I know," Early said. "Each year he teaches me 
something new." 
</P>
<P>
Much of his work has to do with sports, Early said. And he favors working late 
nights in front of the television. Not the same kind of inspiration that the 
great masters had, but it's what works for him. 
</P>
<P>
But his days once again are crowded with football. 
</P>
<P>
"Every now and then, I break out the sketch pad and maybe dabble a little bit," 
Early said. "But I am concentrating on my football for the next six months." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the indications are promising. Coach Dan Henning said Early is looking 
stronger than he did even before he sprained his knee in the fourth game last 
season. That injury, and the arthroscopic surgery that followed, kept him out 
until the final two games. 
</P>
<P>
"He is as good as he has been since I've been here," said Henning, who is 
starting his second season with the Chargers. "I don't know what he was like in 
'88, but I liked him in camp last year, then he got hurt. But I think he is 
better than he was in camp or at the end of (last) season." 
</P>
<P>
But Early was not at full strength for those final two games. His knee still 
bothered him and required a second arthroscopic surgery after the season. 
</P>
<P>
Always after such procedures, there are some doubts. Early tried to put them 
aside from the start. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go in saying, 'Well, I hope I don't get hurt,' because when you do 
that is when you do get hurt," Early said. "You have to always play as hard as 
you can, go full bore and just have confidence about yourself." 
</P>
<P>
No one probably watched this process more intently than Henning. He needed to 
see the signs that told him Early's knee was trouble-free and that he would 
play the same way. His 22 years of coaching have taught him what to look for. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a subjective thing from my standpoint," Henning said. "You get a feel 
that the guy is giving his best effort out there; that he is not tentative. 
It's little things we call body language. In a receiver, you look for explosion 
coming into cut and out of cuts." 
</P>
<P>
Now more than ever Henning needs to see those hopeful signs. Injuries to Wayne 
Walker and Troy Johnson have left the Chargers with only two receivers who have 
caught a pass in an NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
One is Anthony Miller, who went to the Pro Bowl after a sophomore season in 
which he caught 75 passes for 1,252 yards and 13 touchdowns. The other is 
Early, who in 1988 caught 29 passes for 375 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Henning would like nothing better than to see a healthy Early and Miller teamed 
up again. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that strikes you when you first work with Quinn Early is work ethic 
and determination," Henning said. "There is very little imbalance in his daily 
performance. He is always very close to the same level, and that level is 
usually high. Those are all great things to have in a football player."
