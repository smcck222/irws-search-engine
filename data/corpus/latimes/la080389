INDIANS, MISSION AGREE ON PLAN TO SCRAP HALL AT DISPUTED SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Kumeyaay Indians have reached an agreement with Mission San Diego de Alcala 
that will scrap plans for a meeting hall on a disputed mission site, an elder 
for the tribe said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's settled," Kumeyaay elder Clarence Brown said after Indian negotiators 
approved the latest proposal by the Roman Catholic parish. 
</P>
<P>
The Kumeyaay will formally announce the agreement today once both parties sign 
it, Brown said. The two truckloads of Indian remains taken from the site will 
be reburied there in Catholic and Kumeyaay ceremonies Friday and Saturday, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is similar to the compromise proposal by the office of the state 
attorney general, which rules out construction on the site "for the foreseeable 
future," Brown said. Another source close to the negotiations confirmed that 
wording. The Kumeyaay had previously demanded that the site remain undisturbed 
"in perpetuity." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which follows three weeks of negotiations, also calls for the 
diocese to give the Indians two months' notice before applying for any 
development permits for the site, Brown said. And the mission has reportedly 
agreed to designate a part of the lot as a cemetery. A source close to the 
talks confirmed these provisions, as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Certainly Good News' 
</P>
<P>
"If the Kumeyaay Indians have accepted our offer, then that's certainly good 
news," said parish spokesman William Finley. The mission had not been notified 
of the Kumeyaay decision as of Wednesday afternoon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. I. Brent Eagen, who heads the meeting hall project, could not be reached 
for comment Wednesday. Kumeyaay officials said they would not respond to 
further queries until today's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement follows a month of controversy over diocese plans to build a 
meeting hall on a site that contains historic ruins and human remains. And, 
although it represents a setback for the 10-year-old proposal, the hall's 
ultimate fate remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
A parish committee formed by Eagen to find alternative sites for the building 
met for the first time Tuesday, said committee member Janet Bartel. But the 
parishioners worry that archeological ruins and human bones will also be found 
on other prospective sites, Bartel said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Layer to Obscure Ruins 
</P>
<P>
Under the new accord, a layer of earth will once again obscure much of the 
ruins, believed to be those of an early mission church, sources said. Only one 
of the pits excavated on the site did not contain human remains and could thus 
be left open, said Joy Massa, chairwoman of a committee of preservationists 
opposing the meeting hall. Massa said her group supports the Kumeyaay demands. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also raises questions about the hearing on the controversy before 
the city council Monday. Last week, a City Hall aide said the hearing would 
proceed regardless of an accord between the Kumeyaay and the diocese because 
historic preservation issues were not addressed in the negotiations. But a 
Kumeyaay source said Wednesday that the agreement alters the tribe's role at 
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Before the agreement, preservationists had been preparing a lawsuit against the 
city and the diocese aimed at barring construction on the site. Massa said last 
week that such a lawsuit may still be filed, even if an accord is reached, in 
order to force the mission to release archeological data.

SOME PAY PRICE, BUT FOR OTHERS OCEANSIDE SPAN TAKES BIGGER TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Bob Herrera and other residents of the Murray Mission area of Oceanside, 
it's no small irony that their neighborhood convenience store beckons just out 
of reach, across the dry gulch known as the San Luis Rey River. 
</P>
<P>
Because for many homeowners, the store isn't so convenient after all. It lies 
beyond the concrete curtain, what at least one resident has called the Great 
Wall of Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
To make those last-second dinner-time runs for milk or bread, or even to buy a 
morning paper, Herrera and others must pay a 50-cent toll to cross the Murray 
Road bridge, the tiny span that is both loved and loathed in this little corner 
of North County. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, milk doesn't cost $2, it costs $2.50. Cigarettes, bread, anything 
you want to name, is also 50 cents more," said Herrera, president of the 
530-home Murray Mission homeowner's association, who can almost see the 
convenience store from his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
And, if you just plain forget something at the store, residents say, you have 
to pay a second time to cross the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"The next nearest market on this side is more than 4 miles away," Herrera said. 
"So, when your kids want milk for their cereal, you have to bite the big one 
and pay the 50 cents." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Relief From Tolls 
</P>
<P>
The venerable San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge isn't the only toll crossing in San 
Diego County. There's also the Murray Road bridge, the Coronado span's country 
cousin to the north. 
</P>
<P>
But as the North County continues its relentless growth, the 654-foot-long 
Murray Road span has become a bridge over troubled, if not downright angry, 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
Because, even as officials begin to ease the required tolls at its giant sister 
span, an end to the practice of throwing quarters at the Murray Road bridge is 
nowhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
"With this bridge, they used to just charge between 5 a.m. and 8 p.m.," Herrera 
said. "Then they increased it to 24 hours a day and put an attendant there so 
you couldn't blow them off. Instead of getting better, the tolls are getting 
more severe." 
</P>
<P>
Herrera isn't the only one chaffing over what many consider to be a pesky toll. 
The issue is routinely raised during Murray Mission homeowner's meetings, he 
said. And many of the North County commuters who use the bridge as a shortcut 
to the back gate at Camp Pendleton aren't thrilled with it either. 
</P>
<P>
The $4.2-million structure was built by the city of Oceanside five years ago to 
keep traffic flowing over the San Luis Rey River, which frequently flooded, 
washing out the old road that ran across the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
Since the city didn't have the money to pay for the bridge outright, however, 
revenue bonds were used to finance construction. 
</P>
<P>
And, under the current repayment plan, the bridge won't be paid off until the 
year 2004, according to Oceanside city Councilwoman Melba Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tolls Here to Stay 
</P>
<P>
So, for now, she said, the tolls are here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop has a stake in the success of the bridge. The Murray Mission resident 
spearheaded its construction and was the first to proudly drive across it on 
ribbon-cutting day. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my bridge," she said. "And the people who are doing the complaining 
don't have any history as to why it was built. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us remember children dying in that river, times that our husbands 
couldn't go to work because the water was so high, and other times when we 
worried whether a fire truck could ever get to us if we had a fire. I mean, we 
were surrounded by water on all sides." 
</P>
<P>
The river flooded so often, she said, that the road was unusable for months at 
a time. The alternative route is a 12-mile detour, partly along narrow and 
crowded Mission Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The toll bridge, Bishop said, provided a more permanent solution. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the area between the bridge and California 78 resembles a lunar 
landscape as earthmovers scurry along the desolate terrain like worker ants, 
clearing the way for new condominium projects. The old Murray Road has been 
renamed College Avenue and extended south to California 78, opening the bridge 
to a barrage of new traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, since the road was expanded two years ago, traffic across the bridge 
has doubled-from 2,200 vehicles a day to more than 4,800. 
</P>
<P>
So why can't it be paid off any sooner? bridge-crossers ask. 
</P>
<P>
"The money you blow on that bridge adds up," said Katie Doffeny, a visiting 
nursing assistant who said she crosses the bridge at least twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
Like many, she'd like to see monthly passes issued for regular users. 
</P>
<P>
"They say they're going to stop collecting the tolls when the bridge is paid 
for. I believe that like a hole in the head." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Husby, director of finance and management for the city of Oceanside, said 
the first call date on the bonds isn't due for another four years. 
</P>
<P>
"But that bridge is more than paying for itself. And, if it continues, the City 
Council has many options. They can pay off the debt early. But, when that will 
happen, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Angry Responses 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, toll-taker Arnold Smith watches the regular bridge users -- 
the "frequent fliers" -- pass by each day. 
</P>
<P>
He's seen the old ladies miss the toll basket with quarter after quarter, 
watched the businessmen do their car seat dance after they spill coffee down 
their crotch while reaching for change. 
</P>
<P>
He's heard the angry complaints, listened to all the excuses. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard them all," said Smith, who works the morning rush-hour shift, when 
85% of the traffic is military en route to Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones I especially like are, 'I'm lost and I just made a U-turn, do I have 
to pay?' or 'C'mon buddy, give me a break. My girlfriend lives just over the 
other side.' " 
</P>
<P>
But this is Oceanside, not the big city. So, when people are short of cash, the 
toll-takers will sometimes make up the difference from their own pockets -- 
"little loans," they say, which are often repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, though, the complaints get on Smith's nerves. Hostility can run 
high. So Smith has his responses. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell some people that the toll was put here for tourists from the East 
Coast, so they'll feel right at home," he said. "When they grouse about the 
toll, I tell them, 'You're right, that 50-cent cost is ridiculous. I think it 
should be a buck.' " 
</P>
<P>
Some bridge users don't give Smith time for his routine. They just run the 
tolls. As many as 30 toll-runners a day careen through the toll house with the 
wood-shingled roof, attendants say. 
</P>
<P>
One motorist whizzed past at 90 m.p.h., striking a light post and dragging it a 
quarter mile before police caught up with him. 
</P>
<P>
The response of the toll-takers is swift: jot down license numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Katie Doffeny is one of those who got caught. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, I got so fed up I just blasted across," she said. "But they got my 
license number. A few days later, I got a $10 ticket in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone's blood pressure rises, however, at the sight of the Murray Road 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"What's 50 cents?" asked Sarah Benner. "I go across that bridge twice a day. It 
would take me that much gas and more to drive around the long way." 
</P>
<P>
Freddie Hicks, a resident of the Shadow Oaks housing development, takes the 
toll in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom lives on the other side," he said. "But I can't use the toll as an 
excuse not to go visit her on Sunday. I know, I've tried." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defender of Bridge 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Oakley, manager of the 7-Eleven store on the north side of the bridge, 
summed up the feelings of a bushel of other bridge users. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't have the floods like we used to," he said. "Since they put that 
bridge in, the water has stayed away. I think it would be better off just to 
put the road back." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Councilwoman Bishop defends her bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"My answer to these people is that nobody has to use that bridge," she said. 
"If they don't want to pay, they can still drive around the long way. And 
anyone who thinks that riverbed will stay dry is kidding themselves. That river 
will be back someday, and in a big way."

MOJONNIER SPENT $885 FROM CAMPAIGN MONEY ON BEAUTY ADVICE TO EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SACRAMENTO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) spent more than $800 in 
campaign funds this year for fashion and beauty consultants to advise her staff 
members on how to dress, arrange their hair and what makeup to use, according 
to reports filed with the secretary of state this week. 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier paid $440 from her reelection committee to Reflection of Success, a 
La Mesa consulting firm, to advise the five employees of her San Diego district 
office in April on how to dress to meet the public. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Styling, Makeover at Salon 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier also paid $405 out of a second campaign committee -- Friends of Sunny 
Mojonnier-1990 -- for her staff members to receive hair styling and a beauty 
makeover in April at the Beau Monde beauty salon in Mission Valley, an expense 
she classified as "travel, accommodations or meals." 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier said she believes that spending campaign money for the beauty and 
fashion consultants is appropriate because it helps to upgrade the public image 
of her office staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea was to put a more polished and professional look on my district 
staff," said Mojonnier, who added that she wanted her employees to "make a 
better impression when they stand in front of people." 
</P>
<P>
The latest disclosure of Mojonnier's use of campaign funds comes at a time the 
assemblywoman acknowledges that her political finances are in disarray, and she 
has asked her campaign treasurer to determine whether she double-billed the 
campaign account for more than $7,700 in travel and eating expenses last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Once he corrects the mess that's there, hopefully we'll be able to straighten 
it out," Mojonnier said. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest part of the potential double billings includes a $6,600 trip, taken 
at public expense, to Spain in November to help plan for the 500th anniversary 
of Columbus' discovery of America. Mojonnier said she sent a $3,500 check to 
the state treasurer's office earlier this week to cover anything an audit may 
show she has to pay back to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, campaign funds are established to receive political donations 
from individuals and political action committees. The campaign accounts are 
distinct from the public money that state legislators receive to run their 
office and pay their staff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Uses Prohibited 
</P>
<P>
Campaign money can be used for anything that is "substantially related" to an 
officeholder's job or political campaign, said Eugene Hill, assistant attorney 
general in charge of the government law section. 
</P>
<P>
But the law prohibits legislators from dipping into their political war chests 
for personal reasons. "A payment from campaign funds is for personal use if the 
payment creates a substantial personal benefit and does not have more than a 
negligible political, legislative or governmental purpose," the law says. 
</P>
<P>
The vagueness of the law has yielded a patchwork of decisions on what 
constitutes a permissible use of campaign funds. In the past, the state 
attorney general's office has approved the purchase of some kinds of clothing, 
paying the salary of a relative working on campaigns, the purchase of sports 
tickets, donations to nonprofit groups and, in one case, the installation of a 
home security system to protect official documents. 
</P>
<P>
Yet attorney general opinions have also held that expenditures for medical 
examinations, personal legal fees and health club memberships are not allowed 
because they are considered personal, despite their "collateral effects upon 
political, governmental or legislative activities." 
</P>
<P>
Hill declined Wednesday to say whether Mojonnier's expenditures for the fashion 
consultant and her staff's excursion to the beauty parlor would be permissible. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "It sounds on the outer edge to me." 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier's campaign statements show that her two political committees raised 
$27,446 while spending $39,432 in the first six months of this year. She spent 
her campaign money for hotel rooms in Washington, Palm Springs, San Francisco, 
Long Beach, New York, Arlington, 
</P>
<P>
Va., and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Booked Room for Inauguration 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier said she booked a Washington hotel room for the inauguration of 
President Bush, and the rooms in Arlington and Central America were booked 
during her recent Defense Department tour of National Guard activities in 
Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras and Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
The assemblywoman said she paid $770 to stay at the Long Beach Hyatt Regency 
this year so she could observe firsthand how that city's grand prix affected 
pedestrian and car traffic. The expense was related to her official duties 
because the Del Mar grand prix is in her district and there is talk of 
expanding the races, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier said her other hotel expenditures were legitimate but she couldn't 
recall offhand why she paid for the rooms in Palm Springs and San Francisco, 
which is 90 minutes from Sacramento by car. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a meeting in San Francisco for something. I don't remember what it was. 
I spent the night, if it was a night meeting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the campaign expenditures on behalf of her staff, Mojonnier said she 
hired a consultant from Reflection of Success to hold individual sessions with 
her five district employees, including her secretary, on April 27 and 28. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Dragon-Lady Eyes 
</P>
<P>
The idea, she said, was to have "someone do an analysis of all the staff, as 
far as the kind of clothes they should not wear." 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier's staff paid a visit to the Beau Monde on April 28, where each 
underwent a 2 1/2- to 3-hour beauty makeover. Mojonnier said the purpose of 
that visit was to improve their appearance, "to teach them, to tell them if 
they had dragon-lady eyes how they would fix them to be more presentable to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
Myra Tonner, owner of the Beau Monde, said Mojonnier's office staff enjoyed its 
visit. The makeovers, which cost $60 to $70 per person, included hair styling 
and a complete application of makeup, Tonner said. 
</P>
<P>
"They all appeared very happy with the result," she said. "They left smiling 
and liked the way they looked and felt much improved." 
</P>
<P>
"It changed hair style on them and makeup so they looked different," Tonner 
said. "For the public, they need to have a certain look." 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one of the girls had long, scraggly hair, and, when we finished 
with her, she left with long, scraggly hair," Tonner said. "She was sort of a 
difficult person. She certainly didn't look professional." 
</P>
<P>
An employee in Mojonnier's district office on Wednesday referred questions 
about the beauty parlor visit to the assemblywoman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1,229.60 for Outfits 
</P>
<P>
This year's campaign expenditures do not mark the first time Mojonnier has gone 
to her campaign fund for the sake of appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign reports for 1988 show she spent $1,229.60 for two outfits purchased 
specifically for the Hotel del Coronado's centennial celebration. The outfits, 
made by a Sacramento shop called Pegg's Pretties, were expensive because they 
were made to reflect the fashions of 100 years ago, Mojonnier said. 
</P>
<P>
"The event was to be done in period and all that, and everybody was dressed 
accordingly," Mojonnier said of the celebration, which lasted several days. 
</P>
<P>
Using campaign funds for the dresses was legitimate because, "if I wasn't a 
representative, I wouldn't be going to the event," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Alhough Mojonnier defended the beauty parlor and fashion expenditures, she said 
she has asked her new campaign treasurer and the state treasurer's office to 
see whether she double-billed her campaign fund and the state for a trip to 
Spain last year. She also said she sent the treasurer the $3,500 check to cover 
anything she might owe the state in connection with the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier made the Nov. 10-Dec. 2 trip as the state's sole representative from 
the Quincentennial Committee, a panel of legislators established to help plan 
the 1992 celebration of the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Double-Billing Check 
</P>
<P>
Documents submitted to the state Assembly's Office of Travel show that 
Mojonnier was reimbursed $6,648.53 in public funds for her air fare, rental 
car, lodging and telephone bill. 
</P>
<P>
Her campaign reports last year show expenditures of $8,239.90 for travel from 
late October to the end of 1988. Mojonnier told The Times she could not recall 
whether any of the campaign money covered the Spain trip. 
</P>
<P>
She also said she has asked her campaign treasurer to check an apparent 
double-billing of her political account for another $1,115 in travel and eating 
expenses last year. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign reports show that Mojonnier was reimbursed twice for that amount, 
which covered meals, air fare and $717 for a room at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in 
Washington. And her campaign statement for this year shows her political fund 
may have paid for that room yet a third time, when it reimbursed the Assembly's 
Office of Travel for $717. 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier said the double billing was unintentional and she did not catch it 
because she doesn't check the backup paper work when she receives a 
reimbursement from her campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would I do that?" she asked, referring to the double billing. "I certainly 
wouldn't expect to be paid twice for anything. 
</P>
<P>
"If, inadvertently, a mistake was made, whether it was an accountant or 
whatever, if I have to correct it I'll correct it," Mojonnier said. "I'm not 
out to do anything wrong. I work hard to do what I'm doing, and the one thing I 
don't pay attention to is the different things that happen along the way."

SCIENTISTS, EPA TO DEBATE SEWAGE PLANT; 
</P>
<P>
SCRIPPS, U.S. OFFICIALS CONFLICT ON NEED FOR $2.6-BILLION PROJECT

<P>
In an effort to resolve questions about the need for a planned $2.6-billion 
secondary sewage treatment plant in San Diego, officials of the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency have agreed to meet with scientists from the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in a forum here later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Tentatively scheduled for Aug. 15, the meeting is intended to give Scripps 
scientists who contend that secondary sewage treatment is unnecessary an 
opportunity to present their scientific arguments to EPA officials, who 
consistently have argued that the city must build the plant to comply with 
federal water standards. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was arranged Wednesday by Mayor Maureen O'Connor and lawyer Miles 
Harvey, chairman of the Metropolitan Sewer Task Force, during a telephone 
conversation with Harry Seraydarian, the EPA's regional director for toxics and 
waste management.

<P>
Although O'Connor said she is doubtful that the EPA will change its position on 
the matter, she expressed hope that a debate between the two sides' scientists 
might help to clarify the evidence supporting the conflicting conclusions about 
the proposed plant's environmental merits -- or lack thereof. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can get the facts on the table and ascertain which scientists are 
correct," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Harvey said he hopes that "a true comparison of the conclusions" in 
the meeting before members of the city's sewer task force will help to "flesh 
out an issue that's been obscured . . . by a lot of talk of political 
posturing." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Bruce Henderson, a vocal critic of the proposed plant, has more 
ambitious objectives for the meeting, saying he hopes to persuade the EPA to 
reconsider its insistence that the facility, which could double residential 
bills, be built. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very significant event with enormous potential," Henderson said. 
"The important thing about the EPA coming here is that it gives us a chance to 
convince them that bad things aren't going to happen to the ocean if we don't 
go to secondary treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the protracted controversy, Dr. Roger Revelle, Scripps' professor 
emeritus, and other local scientists have argued that the proposed plant is 
unnecessary because the sewage now discharged into the ocean from the city's 
Point Loma treatment facility causes no significant problems. In fact, the 
sewage actually is beneficial to the ocean environment, the scientists contend. 
</P>
<P>
Although the EPA has been aware of such arguments for more than a decade -- and 
has not been deterred by them to date -- Henderson said he believes that the 
forum "could change some minds." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't expect anything but that the EPA is coming here with an open mind," 
Henderson said. "I don't think it's a closed matter at all. I think there's 
confusion about what the issues are and what the evidence shows. That's why 
this dialogue is so important. It's a way to try to get the EPA to acquiesce 
and admit that there's no credible scientific evidence for secondary 
treatment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Violation of the Law' 
</P>
<P>
Raising doubts about the likelihood of an EPA shift, O'Connor noted that 
Seraydarian told her during Wednesday's conversation: "Mayor, you're still in 
violation of the law . . . as of today." If the EPA budges at all, O'Connor 
said, it may simply be on the construction timetable for the proposed secondary 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if we (have) a chance at all, it's on the timing," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy stems from the EPA's enforcement of provisions of the Clean 
Water Act, which limits the amount of solids allowed in effluents pumped into 
the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego now uses "advanced primary" sewage treatment, which removes 75% of 
the solids from the effluent before it is discharged about 2 1/2 miles off 
Point Loma. Under an EPA order that the city agreed to in 1987 when it 
abandoned a six-year fight for an exemption, secondary treatment measures would 
increase the amount of solids removed to 85% to 90%. 
</P>
<P>
Local scientists and others, however, argue that the secondary treatment 
process offers no significant environmental advantages. The Clean Water Act, 
they add, unnecessarily applies an inland, freshwater standard to a coastal 
marine environment that is larger and more resilient than river systems. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we'll settle the differences," Harvey said. "But getting 
everybody together under the same roof is a step in the right direction."

<P>
A family argument in Oceanside that erupted in gunfire has left one man dead 
and one of his brothers sought in the killing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Riojas, 27, was pronounced dead at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, according to the 
coroner's office. Oceanside police, responding to a call of a disturbance, 
found Riojas lying on a driveway in the 1400 block of Papin Street about 7 
p.m., Oceanside police spokeswoman Sylvia O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
Riojas and his two brothers, who share a residence on Papin Street, had been 
arguing, O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Riojas was armed with a large stick, and Antonio Riojas was armed with a 
gun, O'Brien said. The fight spilled into the street and Jose Riojas was shot 
at least once. Antonio Riojas fled the scene, O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
A warrant was issued for his arrest on suspicion of murder, authorities said. 
The third brother, whose name was unavailable and who is believed to be about 
26, was questioned by police and released.

SUPPORTERS PACK COURT FOR SUSPECT IN TRAFFIC SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friends, relatives and business associates packed the courtroom Wednesday to 
support murder suspect Roger Sing Ip, who pleaded not guilty to killing a 
15-year-old boy after a traffic dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Every seat in the felony arraignment department of San Diego Municipal Court, 
which has about 80 seats, was filled for Ip's arraignment and bail review. Ip, 
33, of Spring Valley turned himself in last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ip's attorney, Elisabeth Semel, told Judge Frank Brown that Ip would return to 
court if granted a reduction in his $1-million bail, but the judge turned her 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Semel said that friends and relatives had put together property and cash that 
would equal $500,000, but that $1 million was out of their reach. 
</P>
<P>
The fatal shooting of Kurt Von Yokes of La Jolla occurred late July 10 after a 
near-collision with a car believed to have been driven by Ip and another car in 
which Yokes was a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe Ip followed the Yokes car for several miles. When Yokes got 
out and approached the car following him, he was shot in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg McClain told the court he was concerned that Ip, born 
in Hong Kong, might flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
"He's obviously not the person everyone thinks he is," McClain said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Semel, though, described Ip as "peaceful, quiet and respectful." 
</P>
<P>
She said those who attended the arraignment represented a "gamut of 
professions." Supporters included business associates from his Pacific Beach 
Chinese restaurant, present and former neighbors, customers, postal patrons 
from his work as a postal worker, engineers, and university professors, Semel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing was scheduled Sept. 13.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: RANCHO BERNARDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Border Patrol agents intercepted a tractor-trailer rig late Tuesday packed 
with 105 illegal aliens on Interstate 15 near Rancho Bernardo, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Agents stopped the truck about 11:30 p.m. and arrested the driver, Frank 
Ellinger, 45, of National City on suspicion of smuggling aliens, patrol 
spokesman Michael Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was apparently headed toward the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The stop is part of a continuing investigation by agents of the San Diego 
sector that began last November and has led to the arrests of five people. 
</P>
<P>
The group of aliens consisted of 102 Mexican nationals, three Jamaicans, and 
one each from Guatemala and Honduras. Included in the group were 30 women and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all in pretty good shape," he said. "They were not in the back of 
the trailer for very long before it was stopped. It could have been a different 
story if it had been in the daytime." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the aliens were deported, but several were held as material witnesses, 
Gregg said.

I read with interest the Feldsteins' article. Well written, well argued, 
however, when boiled down it tells us this: "We must go ahead and kill 
ourselves with industrial pollution because it would be too expensive and too 
inconvenient to stay alive." 
</P>
<P>
Their economists' approach pushed my doggerel button and this came out: 
</P>
<P>
"When they speak of pollution and such, the Feldsteins are quite out of touch;

<P>
"Don't bother to strive, too keep us alive, for living will cost us too much."

A MAN OF CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To be born a child of privilege in the world's most successful capitalist 
economy and then live your life as a Socialist in the era of Marxism's 
exhaustion requires special qualities. Author and activist Michael Harrington, 
who died Monday at the age of 61, had them, including the gift of speaking 
truth to power. 
</P>
<P>
As a young social worker and Catholic radical, he advanced the cause of labor, 
the poor and nonviolence while an editor of the Catholic Worker. Later, as the 
author of an influential book, "The Other America," he helped shame a smug 
nation into admitting that, for many among us, the American dream was a 
nightmare of need. 
</P>
<P>
One critic rightly called that work, which inspired the War on Poverty, "a call 
to conscience." It was, and so were the other dozen books, hundreds of articles 
and thousands of speeches he made over the subsequent quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when socialists persevered in the belief that they themselves 
would live to see the day when man was no longer wolf to man. As chairman of 
the Democratic Socialists of America, Harrington had no such faith. What he did 
believe was that a healthy economy was an engine of justice, as well as 
production, and that people matter more than profits.

<P>
I write magazine articles for a living, and nothing delights me more than to 
find good writing -- writing that transcends reporting -- in the news media. 
</P>
<P>
The feature articles that you run on the front page, left-hand column, are 
consistently good.The writers take obscure subjects (such as where artists live 
in Los Angeles) and make them interesting. 
</P>
<P>
But the high point of my week is the new column, "On California," written by 
Robert A. Jones. Whether he's talking about real estate or a football team, 
Jones is concise, entertaining and insightful.

Martin and Kathleen Feldstein's column "Environmental Purity Can Cost Too Much" 
(Op-Ed Page, July 23) failed to take into account the fact that if we do not 
clean up our pollution problems quickly we will have no need for the 
educational and housing programs to which they feel environmental funding 
should be diverted. We will be building our homes on landfills and educating 
our children in glass houses to protect them from the toxic waste if the 
government and the people of our communities do not act. 
</P>
<P>
A point was made that for reductions in the annual sulfur dioxide emissions 
from 20 million tons per year to 15 million tons in 6 years would cost $700 
million, a price the Feldsteins felt was too high. To eliminate an additional 5 
million tons by the year 2000 might cost five times as much. Maybe we should 
focus our attention on the overfunded defense budget and the necessity for the 
120 B-2s the military would like to have. The price tag on one B-2 was over a 
half-billion dollars. How about making a few less in the name of cleaning up 
the environment?

DEADLY RIVALRIES OF SHIITES ARE MAGNIFIED BY ALLIANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Antony's College at Oxford University.

<TEXT>
<P>
When the Israelis decided to kidnap Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, it seems likely 
that they saw it as just another tactic in their longstanding attempt to police 
southern Lebanon and to obtain the return of their own three soldiers held 
hostage by Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
But as sometimes happens, events in Lebanon set off a chain reaction that 
included the announcement of the murder of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. 
Higgins and then a rapidly growing crisis agitating Washington and Moscow, 
Damascus and Tehran. If Lebanon often seems like a nest of angry hornets, it is 
also a spider's web of interests and passions that exaggerates small incidents 
by linking them with large numbers of other powerful political actors and 
influences. 
</P>
<P>
One of the fuses that connects southern Lebanon to Beirut and beyond is the 
rivalry between the two main Shiite groups, Amal and Hezbollah. Amal, the older 
of the two, has driven the Hezbollah fighters out of most of the villages along 
the border with Israel and, on the whole, tries to keep things quiet there. For 
its part, Hezbollah, which in turn controls most of the Muslim suburbs of 
Beirut, has every interest by demonstrating that it is much more active than 
its rival in fighting what it sees as the enemies of Islam and promoting the 
defense of the south against prolonged Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Each group also receives varying degrees of support from Syria and Iran. On the 
whole, the Syrians try to use their strong leverage with Amal to limit and 
control Hezbollah's influence. But they have never pushed this too far, knowing 
that it would be resisted by powerful men among their Iranian allies. However, 
following the recent visit of the leaders of the various Lebanese Shiite groups 
to Tehran, the Syrians now have reason to hope that Iranian President Hashemi 
Rafsanjani will manage to swing the bulk of his regime over to supporting Amal 
more strongly as well. It follows that anyone eager to make life difficult for 
either Rafsanjani or the Syrians has an obvious interest in encouraging further 
Hezbollah extremism. 
</P>
<P>
Caught in the middle of all this are the unfortunate men who are being held 
hostage in West Beirut or nearby. Both Rafsanjani and President Hafez Assad of 
Syria would like the prestige of being able to secure their release -- at a 
suitable price. But neither has been able to bring enough influence to bear on 
their kidnapers, ruthless men with strong nerves who have managed to keep the 
captives hidden away from Western intelligence or from local competitors for up 
to four years in some cases. They trust no one and by kidnaping Terry Waite 2 
1/2 years ago, they removed one of the few acceptable go-betweens who might 
have been able to negotiate further releases. We can only hope that they 
continue to place a very high value on those of their captives who are lucky 
enough to be still alive. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, almost unnoticed in the West, the Lebanese civil war has passed into 
a still more violent and dangerous phase, with regular artillery bombardments 
of the different halves of Beirut between Michel Aoun's mostly Christian 
followers and the Syrians and the Druze forces of Walid Jumblatt. As always, 
there is also outside involvement -- Iraq arming Aoun's forces against its 
Syrian rival, sometimes with the tacit support of the Israelis who also have 
been known to assist ships trying to break the Syrian naval blockade of the 
Christian ports. 
</P>
<P>
Here, as elsewhere, news about Lebanon is bad. The day after Higgins was 
reported hanged, the Arab League team of foreign ministers from Algeria, 
Morocco and Saudi Arabia announced that it had come to a complete dead-end in 
its efforts to end the fighting. In these circumstances, the United States and 
other governments eager to make points in Lebanon or to secure the release of 
their hostages have no alternative but to do so by way of Damascus or Tehran. 
It is up to America whether to do this by threat of force or by persuasion. So 
far, Washington has generally tried quiet diplomacy. It will probably try this 
again provided another hostage is not killed and there are no further acts of 
anti-American violence. 
</P>
<P>
As for the future, there is little doubt that there will be more crises in 
Lebanon, perhaps triggered off accidentally by the Israeli activity in the 
south, perhaps by violent men who will not be able to resist the chance of 
making things more difficult for President Rafsanjani or President Assad, not 
to speak of President Bush. Washington's best hope is to be better prepared 
next time. As crisis has followed crisis in Lebanon, there always has been the 
same air of sudden emergency, of having been caught by surprise, of making 
hasty policy decisions at very short notice. Now, once again, there is an 
opportunity to make plans in advance, to devise a policy that is aimed not only 
at deterring more violence but also at getting the hostages home. Given the 
present degree of anger in the United States, it would help greatly if parts at 
least of any new policy can be publicly announced.

IN MIDDLE EASTERN EYES, U.S. AND ISRAEL ARE INTIMATELY ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PERETZ, Don Peretz is director of the Middle East Program at the State 
University of New York, Binghamton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why did Islamic fundamentalists in southern Lebanon kill a U.S. Marine colonel 
and threaten to kill other American hostages in retaliation for the kidnaping 
of one of their leaders by the Israel army? They have held at least three 
Israeli soldiers prisoner for several years, yet their vengeance was turned 
against the United States rather than Israel. Do they perceive Israel as the 
client of the United States, or is America the client of Israel in their view? 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of the fundamentalists to Israel's strike at their base in Lebanon 
underscores a widely held perception in the Middle East -- that Israel and the 
United States are intimately linked in an alliance closer than any other two 
countries. Few Arabs or Iranians will take seriously statements by the U.S. 
government that it does not approve of, or was not involved in, the kidnaping 
escapade -- especially after the Iran-Contra affair exposed a deep collusion 
between Jerusalem and Washington in that "arms-for-hostages" scheme. 
</P>
<P>
How real or how extensive is this collusion, and which nation, Israel or the 
United States, holds the greatest leverage over the other? It has long been 
established that American intelligence services operate as closely with their 
Israeli counterparts as with any of our Western allies. There is little, if 
any, information passed by Washington to British or other European intelligence 
agents that Israel does not also receive, either through official or other 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the relationship with Israel is more than special. It is unique. Israel 
receives by far the largest amount of American foreign aid, in both absolute 
terms and on a per-capita basis. Egypt, the second largest recipient of 
American assistance, receives its huge allocation largely as a reward for 
signing the 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Relations between the United States 
and Israel have been frequently strained since the intifada began in December, 
1987. But there has never been the slightest hint by either the Reagan or Bush 
administrations that economic or military assistance would be diminished an 
iota. 
</P>
<P>
Last year several members of the House and the Senate, all traditional 
supporters of Israel, took the unusual step of publicly criticizing Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir for his policies in the West Bank and Gaza and for his 
negative response to then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz's peace 
proposals. Yet none was willing to cut economic support. A co-chairman of one 
congressional subcommittee criticized Israel but opposed cutting aid because, 
he reasoned, Israel needed the reassurance that such aid would provide after it 
had been shaken by the U.S. decision to open talks with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization in December. 
</P>
<P>
Yasser Arafat used to call Israel the "spoiled child" of America. Yet last year 
he led the PLO through its greatest policy change toward Israel since the 
organization was established 25 years ago. A major reason for Arafat's 
turnabout was his belief -- one widely held in the Middle East -- that the 
United States and Israel are so intimately linked that the demands of one 
become the wishes of the other. Like the Shiite fundamentalists in Lebanon, he 
believes that either convincing or hurting the United States can convince or 
hurt Israel. If we persuade Washington to alter its policy either through 
diplomacy or by threats and force, we can influence Israel, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
Israelis, of course, perceive the situation differently. The Israeli government 
has great expectations of the United States and is deeply disappointed, even 
chagrined, when Washington publicly castigates it or, in exceptional 
circumstances, votes against it in the United Nations. While the Israeli 
government expects perfect accord with Washington on Middle East matters, its 
leaders often complain that public criticism of its free-lance actions, like 
the kidnaping of the Lebanese Shiite leader or the bombing of Iraq's nuclear 
reactor in 1982, is interference in their country's internal affairs. Often 
these officials explain away U.S. reaction, insisting that what Washington 
condemns in public it applauds in private. Nor do they regard their advice to 
the powerful Israel lobby on Capitol Hill as interference in American domestic 
affairs, but rather as support for what is in the best interests of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Which nation, then, does hold the greatest leverage over the other, Israel or 
the United States? Is it appropriate for Washington to interfere in, influence 
or criticize Israel's "internal affairs" and vice versa? Should Israel keep the 
United States "informed" about -- or clear in advance -- operations like the 
Lebanon kidnaping? These are all questions about which most American 
policy-makers are still undecided. But Middle Easterners believe they have been 
answered -- that Israel and American policy dealing with their region of the 
world is indistinguishable, that each country knows what the other is about to 
do and that Washington's criticism of Israel is merely a smoke screen to cover 
actions turned over to Israel because they do not accord with U.S. policy or 
with the public image of American mores.

ISRAELIS MISREAD THE ZEALOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Intelligence Council.

<P>
I sucked in my breath when I read of the latest Israeli spectacular -- the 
abduction to Israel of a Shiite cleric and radical political activist in 
Lebanon. We recognize this pattern of audacious, usually successful Israeli 
operations to pay back their opponents in kind. But the seizure of a Muslim 
clergyman crossed a new line, one that seemed particularly dangerous. Indeed, 
this action may at least have contributed to the killing of the U.S. Marine 
officer, William R. Higgins. Even more serious confrontations and more killing 
may lie ahead as Israel challenges the radical Shiites on their own turf with 
their own techniques. Not that such clergymen, especially those directing the 
Hezbollah organization, are all holy men. They are deeply enmeshed in their 
ideological war against Israel and the West. But Israel escalated that war and 
thus challenged the deepest instincts of the Shiite psychology. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has consistently demonstrated a willingness to declare no instruments 
off- limits in its fight against terrorism. Such a policy suggests that there 
is no higher value than combating terror. But if other values are to be 
temporarily suspended, they should at least work. That premise is deeply in 
doubt in this case. There is no question that Israel itself has been 
consistently provoked by terrorist action -- although in recent years there 
have been few Israeli losses to Hezbollah terror. Nor is there any doubt that 
Israel knows how to play hardball; witness the assassination last year of key 
PLO leader Abu Jihad and Israel's consistent willingness to use 
high-performance jet aircraft against Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in 
response to Palestinian terror anywhere. But this time Israeli forces have 
seized the initiative with uncertain motives: to swap Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid 
for Israeli and Western hostages, or to distract world attention from the agony 
of the West Bank uprising and policy conflicts with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Why will this Israeli operation probably fail? Because there is an almost 
unbridgeable cultural chasm between the mentality of the radical militant 
Hezbollah and the Western mentality that seeks to use rational, "legal" 
instruments of state against it. In the end, few frontal techniques will deter 
the zealot mentality. The character of Hezbollah represents the extreme end of 
the spectrum -- even among Muslim fundamentalists. The Shiite branch of Islam 
is a culture founded on the very premise of oppression, suffering and martyrdom 
as basic characteristics of life under un-Godly rule. Never mind that 
Hezbollah's antagonism toward the Israeli state invites an Israeli response; in 
its Shiite vision, Hezbollah expects to undergo suffering and martyrdom, which 
the Israelis -- among others -- are apparently willing to provide. 
</P>
<P>
Israel cannot inflict pain to a level where Hezbollah will quit. That is the 
dilemma that Israel's leaders now face. Any effort to "out-fanatic" their 
Shiite enemies may engender a great deal more regional rage in the process. The 
tougher the Israeli response, the more Israel conforms to its expected role of 
oppressor. The only consolation for Israel is that Hezbollah cannot really 
operate inside Israel, and it is not about to undermine the security of the 
Israeli state, short of a regionwide shift to fundamentalism bred of 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
One can appreciate that Israelis feel uniquely pressured as they simultaneously 
struggle to come to terms with the intifada -- again confronted by an adversary 
that draws some solace from suffering for a sacred nationalist cause. They now 
only dimly recall the heady quality of their own role of David against the 
British Goliath at the time of the foundation of the Israeli state. Now those 
roles are reversed -- as so many Israelis are painfully aware. 
</P>
<P>
So what can be done to prevent further such terrorist acts in Lebanon? The 
frank, depressing answer is: not very much. Lebanon presents a unique 
situation, a lawless jungle of competing, warring sects in which the zeal of 
the fanatic is an almost unstoppable weapon in the alleyways of religious and 
sectarian warfare. It is here that Lebanon differs so sharply from other states 
in the region: There is no state that can be held responsible, no "address" 
upon which a response can be visited. 
</P>
<P>
For the United States, the dilemma is even greater. We are less able even than 
the Israelis to play with suspended rules of international conduct in these 
distant wars. There may be only one painful reality: that some minor degree of 
terrorism is the cost of doing business as a great -- and conspicuous -- power 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
We are troubled; we cannot simply turn our backs and allow this kind of evil to 
go unpunished. Yet the environment may be compared with that of our own inner 
cities. Dozens of lives -- many completely innocent -- are taken daily there. 
Some degree of rage helps fuel that violence, along with a healthy dose of 
plain old criminality. We are appalled, we struggle to improve the situation, 
but we cannot declare all-out "war" because we are dealing with an amorphous 
guerrilla force. We can only continue our police and intelligence work and 
maintain our vigilance toward a better day when a hopeless political 
environment evolves into something more amenable to traditional rules of law 
and order. 
</P>
<P>
The same holds for the jungle that is Lebanon. If peace can come to the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Lebanon should not lag too far behind. But in the 
interim, the jungle fighter knows his turf better than we -- or even the 
Israelis -- do.

ONE MAN'S STRATEGY FOR HIS BROTHER'S FREEDOM; 
</P>
<P>
DON'T PROVOKE, DON'T FORGET, KEEP TALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL COOPER, Paul Cooper, a journalist, for the last year has been working 
for his brother's release. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dealing with hostage-takers is a dangerous and frustrating business. Police 
talking to a bank robber with his gun at someone's head, or control-tower 
negotiators parleying with an airline hijacker, know the rules: Keep calm. Stay 
firm, but keep the dialogue flowing. Wait on your opponent. Never provoke him. 
</P>
<P>
The time span of a Beirut kidnaping is infinitely longer than an airport 
stakeout, and it's harder to deal with kidnapers who aren't cornered. But the 
same rules apply. And politicians ignore them at their peril. There's no quick 
way of hitting back at the Lebanese Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest mistake is to react impetuously. Politicians love a quick fix. But 
the Israeli government's Old Testament solution to its problems -- "a kidnap 
for a kidnap" -- was like President Jimmy Carter's attempt to rescue the 
hostages in Tehran, doomed to failure from the outset. This enemy plays by 
different rules. Hostages are bound to be the first casualties. 
</P>
<P>
A more insidious error is to remove the issue from the political agenda. When 
politicians can't solve a problem quickly, they usually ignore it. This is a 
dangerous betrayal of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Political hostage-takers are not individual gangsters. They have identifiable 
paymasters who will respond if constant pressure is applied to them. If the 
surviving hostages in Lebanon are to be set free, the dialogue of diplomacy 
must be kept alive. 
</P>
<P>
The British and American public, unfortunately, are caught up in the same 
pathology of frustration. Some call for air strikes. Others succumb to a 
strange psychological mechanism that transfers the guilt and tension of the 
apparently unsolvable problem onto the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Before the events of last weekend, the attitude of several Americans who talked 
to me was cynical; they had heard that Lt. Col. William R. Higgins was a spy, 
and anyone working for the CIA in Lebanon has to take his chances. 
</P>
<P>
I've met the same response campaigning for the freedom of my brother, Roger 
Cooper, a British businessman. He was arrested in Tehran in 1985 while working 
for McDermott International, an American offshore oil-services group, and he is 
still languishing in Tehran's Evin Prison. A senior personnel officer from 
McDermott said to me, "Your brother was a spy, wasn't he? I saw his TV 
confession." He appeared to be saying that his company didn't care about my 
brother because his arrest must have been his own fault. 
</P>
<P>
No one deserves to be kidnaped. To accept the smear stories of the kidnapers is 
gullible, weak-kneed Western liberalism at its worst. And to believe an 
apparent TV confession, extracted from a prisoner by threat of violence or 
worse, is just wrong-headed. 
</P>
<P>
In my brother's case, the Iranians do not even believe their own allegations. 
Nearly four years after his arrest, Roger has neither been tried nor convicted. 
Nor has his family or government ever been told of a single, specific charge 
leveled against him. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis can only be resolved by a long-term political strategy. Iran 
learned through defeat in the Gulf War that its foreign policy of xenophobic 
isolation did not work. The West's unrelenting diplomatic pressure has borne 
fruit, and Iran's foreign-affairs slogan "Neither East nor West" shows signs of 
moving toward "Both East and West." Any pro-Western momentum must be nurtured, 
not squandered. 
</P>
<P>
It shows incredibly crass political judgment by the Israelis to have chosen 
last weekend for their kidnaping raid. On Friday, the Iranians voted Hashemi 
Rafsanjani in as president. He no longer has to look over his shoulder to see 
what the ayatollah wants. The office of prime minister has been abolished. Yet 
before Rafsanjani has begun work with his Cabinet, Israel has muddied the 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani may be president, but his powers are not unlimited. He must maneuver 
and lead Iran toward the rapprochement with the West he so badly needs to 
rebuild its war-shattered economy. Lebanon is his Achilles heel, since the 
Hezbollah zealots are manipulated and financed by his rivals in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
If the present crisis can be peacefully resolved, which is still doubtful, 
hopes for the hostages look good. The Iranian regime knows that the price of a 
deal with the West is freedom for all Western hostages. A month ago the 
Lebanese Hezbollah itself indicated a change of stance, speaking of the 
kidnapings as "a very big mistake." And Rafsanjani has expressed "deep regret" 
over the reported execution of Col. Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
The stakeout is nearly over. All that is needed is a firm resolve and Iran's 
terror-loving, anti-Western hard-liners will lose their last gamble for power. 
All's on a knife edge. But we can still see our hostages home for Christmas.

PART OWNER IN FILM COMPANY SHOT TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The part owner of a film production company was shot to death on a residential 
street in Northridge, the Los Angeles Police Department reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Joseph Snyder, 47, of Woodland Hills was found shot several times in 
the upper body about 11 p.m. Tuesday near a curb at the intersection of Wilbur 
Avenue and Blackhawk Street, Lt. Ron Lewis said. There were no suspects and no 
known motive for the slaying, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder was a part owner of VCR Inc., a company based in Canoga Park. Lewis said 
police received reports Wednesday that the company was involved in the adult 
film business, but those reports had not been confirmed. A person who answered 
a telephone call at VCR Inc. declined to discuss Snyder or the business. 
</P>
<P>
Police said it was unclear why Snyder was in the Northridge neighborhood. At 
least six shots were fired and Snyder's body was found by someone who was 
walking in the area, police said.

U.S. PROPOSES $40 MILLION FOR ROCKWELL CLEANUP PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Energy's five-year blueprint for cleanup of federal energy 
research and weapons sites includes about $40 million for decontamination and 
environmental testing at Rockwell International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory 
west of Chatsworth and its De Soto Avenue plant in Canoga Park, according to 
documents obtained from the DOE in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
The draft proposal includes more than 20 specific projects for the local plants 
during the next five years, ranging from improved chemical storage and 
ground-water testing to cleanup of old nuclear reactor buildings and tainted 
soil. Since the 1950s, both Santa Susana and the De Soto plant have done 
nuclear research for the DOE and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Although the draft report, recommending $19.5 billion for the first phase of 
cleanup of federal energy sites nationwide, was ordered released Tuesday by 
Energy Secretary James Watkins, DOE officials in Washington and San Francisco 
said they still did not know exactly how much money had been earmarked for the 
Rockwell sites. The $40-million estimate was derived from a review of dozens of 
individual data sheets, spelling out funding levels for specific cleanup 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Final Version 
</P>
<P>
Dick Nolan, special assistant to the manager of DOE's San Francisco operations 
office, said Wednesday he believed the total proposed for the local plants was 
"in the high 30s", but that he wasn't sure. He said a final version of the plan 
is scheduled for release in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, which operates the Santa Susana 
and De Soto plants, said late Wednesday they hadn't seen the plan and couldn't 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
But Nolan called the five-year plan "a living document" that will be 
periodically updated to reflect newly discovered cleanup needs and priorities. 
Some pollution problems, such as chemically tainted ground water, could take 
much longer than five years to correct. 
</P>
<P>
Once the plan is made final, it will still depend on funding by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Despite extensive cleanup needs, officials of Rockwell and the DOE have 
repeatedly said Santa Susana poses no immediate health hazard. The federal 
Environmental Protection Agency has endorsed that position in a qualified way, 
noting that more monitoring of air and ground water is needed to make sure the 
lab is safe. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cleanup projects -- including the big-ticket items -- are at Santa 
Susana, which includes DOE's Energy Technology Engineering Center, where 
Rockwell does research with non-nuclear components of atomic power plants. From 
the mid-1950s through the early '80s, 15 nuclear reactors also were operated at 
Santa Susana for the federal government, and contamination remains despite 
several decommissioning projects. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for spending $7.1 million over four years to decontaminate 
Santa Susana's Building 59, where contaminated steel, sand and ground water 
were left after shutdown of a test nuclear reactor. Rocketdyne officials said 
some of the work has been done. Another $4.4 million is recommended for cleanup 
of former reactor test areas in Building 24. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sodium Burn Pit 
</P>
<P>
The proposal includes $2.27 million for decontamination of soil, buildings and 
a leach field at a complex called the radioactive materials disposal facility, 
and more than $6.4 million to clean up chemical and radioactive contamination 
at a disposal site known as the sodium burn pit. 
</P>
<P>
The draft plan calls for spending as much as $5.2 million to decontaminate the 
"hot cell" at the lab in the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The hot cell is a heavily shielded structure used to declad, or take apart, 
intensely radioactive nuclear fuel. This is done to remove plutonium and other 
materials for future use at other government sites. Rocketdyne's last fuel 
decladding contract with the DOE ran out in 1986. But the company has said it 
hopes to get future work and has applied for renewal of its hot cell license 
with the NRC, a request being opposed by some local groups. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell officials said Wednesday that inclusion of the hot cell cleanup 
project did not mean they had given up hopes of doing nuclear fuel work in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
DOE and Rockwell officials were unable to fully explain a proposed $177,000 for 
disposal of plutonium and other radioactive waste from two pending lab 
experiments. One of the experiments would involve "disposal of depleted uranium 
waste from a DOE/Rocky Flats explosion forming process," according to one of 
the data sheets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Metals Not Explosive 
</P>
<P>
Bob Tuttle, radiation and nuclear safety manager for Rocketdyne, said he did 
not understand that description of the work, which involved a process developed 
at Rocky Flats, the problem-plagued nuclear weapons plant near Denver run by 
Rockwell for the DOE. He said the radioactive metals used in the experiment 
were not explosive. 
</P>
<P>
The largest of the De Soto projects is a proposed $500,000 program to monitor 
ground water beginning next year for chemical and radioactive pollution. State 
water officials, saying they had not been aware of the extent of nuclear work 
at De Soto, asked for the testing several weeks ago. Rockwell officials said 
they do not expect to find any radioactivity. 
</P>
<P>
The De Soto plant operated a small nuclear reactor from 1959, when it opened, 
until 1978. The plant also manufactured nuclear fuel for the Atomic Energy 
Commission and its successor, the DOE, from 1959 until 1982. Decontamination of 
the 100,000-square-foot fuel fabrication area in 1984 involved removal of some 
soil where radioactive water had leaked through pipe joints. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell still operates a gamma irradiation cell at De Soto, and the draft DOE 
plan called for spending $123,000 to decommission it by 1995.

FRUGAL BERNARDI HAD TO SPEND BIG; 
</P>
<P>
$210,000 CAMPAIGN WAS COUNCILMAN'S MOST EXPENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It cost Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi more than $200,000 to 
defeat his challenger, Lyle Hall, who outspent the incumbent in the June runoff 
election by nearly 20% but plunged his failed campaign into debt, campaign 
finance statements show. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, a critic of lavish campaign spending and author of the city's strict 
$500-per-donor limit on contributions, spent more money than in any other race 
in his 28 years as a councilman. The closest was in 1981 when he spent about 
$86,000. 
</P>
<P>
He garnered $184,202 in the first six months of the year from a wide array of 
contributors, including large Los Angeles developers -- several with projects 
planned in his district -- City Hall lobbyists and San Fernando Valley business 
people, the campaign-spending statements show. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I had to raise as much money as I could," Bernardi said Wednesday. "I 
knew that it wouldn't be as much as my opponent, with all of his outside 
supporters. But in the end, I spent the least amount of money and got the most 
votes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biting Hall Mailers 
</P>
<P>
The Bernardi-Hall race to represent the northeast San Fernando Valley's 7th 
District cost almost $500,000, still less than other contested council races. 
The 7th District campaign involved a series of biting Hall mailers that 
attacked the 77-year-old councilman's age and council attendance record. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi won the election 55%-45%. He spent $210,815. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, a Los Angeles city fire captain and former president of the firefighter's 
union, spent $261,291, records show. His contributions during that time totaled 
$287,733 and came largely from firefighters, labor unions and their leaders, 
campaign statements show. 
</P>
<P>
In the critical final month of campaigning before the June 6 election, Hall 
raised $114,815, nearly twice as much as Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
But Hall said Wednesday that he overestimated the amount of contributions he 
would receive in the final weeks, and his campaign slipped $79,279 into debt. 
He said he owes the money to pollsters, printers and consultants. He said he is 
committed to running for office again and will ask his long-time supporters to 
help him retire the debt. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, pressured by union members and firefighters who volunteered to help 
Hall's campaign, hired his own workers in the final months of the runoff. The 
councilman paid eight district residents between $100 and $400 to distribute 
flyers and make phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picus Spent $263,347 
</P>
<P>
In another San Fernando Valley race, Councilwoman Joy Picus spent $263,347 in 
her primary race against five opponents, the campaign statements show. The 
Picus funds represented nearly three times the amount that four of her 
opponents combined spent. One opponent's campaign records have not yet been 
processed by the Los Angeles city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
Picus was reelected with 52% of the vote. Her closest challenger in the April 
primary, Peter Ireland, a deputy of Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, 
received 17% of the vote and spent $29,793. Jeanne Nemo, a Republican activist, 
garnered 15% of the vote and spent $33,445. 
</P>
<P>
The West San Fernando Valley councilwoman said Wednesday that her goal in the 
race was to "raise as much as I could and spend it fully to win in the 
primary." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein raised and spent almost twice 
as much money as her runoff opponent Gerald E. Horowitz, a junior high school 
principal, in her successful bid to retain her West Valley seat. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein's fund-raising efforts were bolstered by strong support from members 
of United Teachers-Los Angeles, who were in the midst of a bitter strike during 
the election. The incumbent, who was sympathetic to the union, spent $185,363, 
much of it in contributions from teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz, who had accused Korenstein of playing to the teachers' union, spent 
$93,298. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign-spending statements showed the following for other Valley-area 
politicians: 
</P>
<P>
*Councilman Michael Woo, who represents part of Studio City, outspent his 
leading challenger 12 to 1, doling out $339,428 to defeat challenger Bernie 
Lohr-Schmidt, who spent $27,828. Woo used his money largely on consultant fees 
and targeted mailings. 
</P>
<P>
*Councilman Marvin Braude, whose predominately Westside district stretches into 
Encino, Tarzana and Woodland Hills, ran unopposed in the primary and donated 
most of his $119,276 in campaign funds to charities, mainly in $1,000 
contributions. He contributed to 10 Valley groups, including Project Heavy, 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the Fair Housing Council. 
</P>
<P>
* Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district includes Sherman Oaks and parts of 
North Hollywood, spent $278,737 to defeat challenger Laura Lake, who spent 
$216,090.

shooting from the roof of a four-unit San Juan Capistrano building at 32181 
Paseo Carolina. No injuries were reported in the blaze first reported at 6:41

MORNING BRIEFING: MOTHER KNEW BEST, BUT IT WAS MEAN TRICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hugh Culverhouse Jr., son of the owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a 
nontitled trouble-shooter for the club, has never been known to back down in a 
fight. For that, he credits his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one time she made me fight the local bully," he told Tom Zucco of 
the St. Petersburg Times. "I was 7, and it was probably the best thing that 
ever happened to me. His name was John Mean. I'm not kidding, that's his name. 
It's funny, but he's now a surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, we were in the Cub Scouts and she was one of the leaders. Well, she 
waited for a rainy day and then she said the activity for the day was boxing. 
Then she produced these two sets of boxing gloves. I had no idea who I was 
going to fight, until she picked Johnny Mean. I thought to myself, 'I'm fat, 
I'm slow and I'm scared to death.' 
</P>
<P>
"I started getting the stuffing kicked out of me, but then I got mad and 
started swinging back. The next thing I knew, through the blood and the tears, 
I hear this woman screaming at the top of her lungs, 'Kill him! Kill him!' 
</P>
<P>
"It was my mom." 
</P>
<P>
Who won? 
</P>
<P>
"I did." 
</P>
<P>
Stop the presses: Mel Kiper, NFL draft expert for ESPN, told USA Today he's 
picking the Rams to win the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the Rams beating the Redskins in the NFC final, and Cleveland over 
Buffalo in the AFC," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Word of caution: Before you bet the New York Mets to win it all, now that they 
have Frank Viola, don't forget what happened to the Cincinnati Reds in 1977. 
They were coming off two straight World Series victories and appeared to be a 
cinch for a third when they got Tom Seaver from the Mets in mid-season. Seaver 
did beautifully, going 14-3, but the Reds finished second, 10 games behind the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
It's worked the other way, too. When the Chicago Cubs obtained Rick Sutcliffe 
from Cleveland in 1984, he went 16-1 and the Cubs won the title in the National 
League East. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: In 1945, who was the pitcher that led the Chicago Cubs to the 
National League title after being obtained from the New York Yankees during the 
season? 
</P>
<P>
Lottery Lifers: From Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post: "Being with the 
Clippers means always having to say, 'I'm sorry.' They're the NBA's answer to 
Jiffy Lube -- every 10,000 miles they change coaches. Everyone they draft 
either breaks his leg, forgets how to shoot or would rather hold his breath 
until he turns blue than play for them . . . " 
</P>
<P>
On the line: From Dallas running back Herschel Walker, an aspiring G-man, after 
spending a week this summer at the FBI school in Quantico, Va.: 
</P>
<P>
"They had an obstacle course and you shoot at targets to protect your partner 
as you advance up the course. I had fun. There were about 200 recruits there. I 
can see how the agents that come out of the academy are really prepared. I have 
a lot of respect for them." 
</P>
<P>
Walk in the park: Former pro football player Dan Dierdorf, on his flourishing 
career in broadcasting: "I'm appalled at how easy the business is." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Hank Borowy. He was 11-2 for the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Duncan Macdonald, former Stanford miler, looking forward to this 
weekend's World Veterans Championships at Eugene, Ore.: "To tell the truth, the 
competition is only part of the reason for going. It's to see people. There 
could be carousing."

KING GLORIOUS TO SKIP TRAVERS, AND EASY GOER

SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saratoga's 122nd season, which opened Wednesday, will have to make do without 
King Glorious, the star of last Saturday's Haskell Handicap at Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after King Glorious' three-length victory -- and his eighth victory 
in nine starts -- the California-bred colt's owners left open the possibility 
that they might ship him to Saratoga to face Easy Goer in the $1-million 
Travers on Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
But after King Glorious' trainer, Jerry Hollendorfer, returned to Santa Rosa, 
Calif., where he is running a string at the Sonoma County Fair, it was decided 
to skip the Travers. King Glorious was flown to California Tuesday and is now 
back in Hollendorfer's barn at Golden Gate Fields. 
</P>
<P>
Hollendorfer said that the decision was influenced more by New York's 
no-medication rules than anything else. Apparently, the presence of Easy Goer, 
the best 3-year-old in the country, and the Travers' distance of 1 1/4 miles 
were not considerations. King Glorious has never run farther than 1 1/8 miles; 
and in that race, the Haskell, he was coming back to his pursuers through the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
In all nine starts, however, King Glorious has been treated with Lasix, the 
brand name for a diuretic commonly given to horses who bleed from the lungs, 
frequently because of stress. Horses are prohibited from running on Lasix in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
The New York media will undoubtedly be critical of King Glorious' connections 
for ducking the Travers. Hollendorfer and his owners can expect to get the same 
criticism that Alysheba's handlers received when they campaigned the horse 
outside of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Jack Van Berg, Alysheba's trainer, raced the colt without Lasix in 
New Jersey, even though the medication is legal there. Then last year, en route 
to the horse-of-the-year title, Alysheba silenced his critics by winning the 
Woodward Handicap at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
Hollendorfer is already sensitive to the criticism King Glorious got in New 
York-area newspapers when his winning time in the Haskell was the slowest since 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
"It was easy, but was it glorious?" wrote Jenny Kellner in the New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
"Glorious a king, but slow at finish," headlined the Newark Star-Ledger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfair what was written," Hollendorfer said. "I don't see how anybody can 
question the horse's ability to run a mile and a quarter until he's actually 
tried to do it. Until then, he should get the benefit of the doubt. Some of the 
things that were written were irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
The next goal for King Glorious is the $1-million, 1 1/4-mile Super Derby at 
Louisiana Downs on Sept. 24. Hollendorfer said that the colt will need a prep 
race before then. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Easy Goer might make his first start since winning the Belmont 
Stakes, facing older horses for the first time in the $250,000 Whitney Handicap 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast is for showers Saturday. An off-track probably would cause trainer 
Shug McGaughey to scratch Easy Goer, who has lost twice in the mud at Churchill 
Downs -- in last year's Breeders' Cup and in this year's Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
If he runs, Easy Goer will carry 119 pounds. Theoretically, Easy Goer was rated 
at 126 pounds by Bruce Lombardi, Saratoga's racing secretary, but 3-year-olds 
are allowed seven pounds when they face older horses at this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
On a fast track, five other horses are expected to start. They are the entry of 
Cryptoclearance (122 pounds) and Lustra (107); Forever Silver (120); 
Homebuilder (116), and Triteamtri (114). 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer probably will go into the Travers off workouts if he is scratched 
from the Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Day, who will be in from Chicago to ride Easy Goer, has picked up the mount 
on Houston for the A Phenomenon, another stake at Saratoga on Saturday. Day 
replaces Angel Cordero, who has won the Saratoga riding title 12 of the last 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Cordero's mount in the A Phenomenon will be Quick Call, the 5-year-old gelding 
who epitomizes the theory "horses for courses." 
</P>
<P>
Quick Call is a son of Quack who has won every time he has run at this 
month-long meeting in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Quick Call won one of 15 starts at other tracks, but he won all three 
of his races at Saratoga. In 1988, Quick Call again won all three of his races 
at Saratoga, but won two of 14 the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Watters, Quick Call's trainer, doesn't say that Saratoga's mineral 
waters or any other local delicacies are responsible for Quick Call's quirky 
record. Watters says that Quick Call always seems to be peaking at the time he 
reaches Saratoga, adding that the horse, winless in three tries this year, 
</P>
<P>
is again rounding into form. 
</P>
<P>
A colt who has obviously danced too many dances is Mercedes Won, who finished 
seventh in the 10-horse Haskell. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes Won burst into prominence a year ago, winning the Sanford and the 
Hopeful at Saratoga. Then this March, he won the Florida Derby at 15-1 after 
the favorite, Dixieland Brass, was injured during the race. 
</P>
<P>
The Haskell was the 23rd start for Mercedes Won, his 14th this year, and his 
fifth outing in as many weeks. Since the Florida Derby, Mercedes Won has raced 
nine times, and his only two victories have been at Finger Lakes, a minor track 
near Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
There is coast-to-coast mediocrity in the American grass division this year, 
which should have European horsemen drooling when they make their annual fall 
invasion for the Breeders' Cup and other top turf races. 
</P>
<P>
El Senor, a 5-year-old, won two major races at the recently completed Belmont 
Park meeting, but he isn't considered special. 
</P>
<P>
America's best grass candidate might turn out to be Blushing John, who won the 
Hollywood Gold Cup and has established himself as a solid runner on dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Racing Form reportedly is looking at a price increase of 50 cents, 
from $2.50 to $3 a copy. . . . Last year, state-wide off-track horse betting in 
New York produced a profit of $45 million on bets of $1.03 billion. Without the 
5% surcharge on payoffs, which can amount to much more when prices are rounded 
off at both the track and OTB, the system's profit shrank to $15 million. OTB 
employs more than 2,000 people; it takes fewer than 225 to run the state 
lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Genuine Risk, the filly who won the Kentucky Derby in 1980, has never been able 
to produce a foal, but she's currently in foal to Cure the Blues. . . . Coach 
George, who will run in a stake at Atlantic City, N.J., on Saturday, is named 
after George Allen. . . . Easy Goer's stablemate, Awe Inspiring, is scheduled 
to run Saturday in the American Derby at Arlington International Racecourse 
near Chicago. . . . Before her death, Liz Whitney Tippett was one of the social 
heavyweights of Saratoga, arriving each summer on a 70-foot yacht, The 
Adventurer, to watch her horses run. Tippett's widower, Cloyce (Tip) Tippett, 
has sold the yacht and their farm in Virginia.

DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: NEED STILL GREAT FOR SRO SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego's new single-room occupancy residential hotels are garnering alot of 
attention, not just here but across the country. Out-of-town architects, 
planners, developers and politicians often inquire about the roughly 1,000 new 
SRO rooms built here since The Baltic Inn became the first new SRO in more than 
50 years when it opened in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Building code changes helped pave the way for the new projects, easing sewer 
hookup fees, parking requirements and various code restrictions to compensate 
for the expensive fire sprinklers required because low-cost construction is 
more combustible. 
</P>
<P>
But while the bright new SROs, many of them built with financial assistance 
from the San Diego Housing Commission, are getting the spotlight, the housing 
situation for low-income people still looks bleak, particularly downtown, where 
the new SROs are concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
By some estimates, there were nearly 10,000 SRO rooms in downtown San Diego 
before redevelopment began in the 1970s. Now there are about 3,500, and, 
despite more than 1,000 additional SRO rooms due in the next year or two, the 
total number will fall 1,000 rooms short of meeting the annual demand for new 
rooms between now and 1991, according to a Housing Commission survey. 
</P>
<P>
There are actually two problems: New SROs can't be built fast enough, and older 
units are facing extinction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cleared of Tenants 
</P>
<P>
The Gordon Hotel, a 26-room SRO at 1334 7th Ave., where rents start at less 
than $200, has been cleared of tenants by its owners, 600 Associates, even 
though they haven't gotten demolition or building permits. 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Commission has yet to determine whether the Gordon is exempt from 
the city's SRO Preservation Ordinance (which requires developers to replace, or 
pay for the replacement of, any SRO rooms demolished), or whether it has 
adequately provided for the relocation of tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the developers won't divulge their plans for the Gordon. Kathy 
Rodman, an attorney for the Legal Aid Society, which represents low-income 
clients, is working with an undisclosed group of San Diegans in the hope of 
preventing demolition. She said a contractor hired by her clients found the 
building to be structurally sound and a good candidate for rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
For many people, older SROs such as the Gordon are the last rung of housing 
before the streets, with rates substantially below the $310 average rate for 
new SROs. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of families need low-cost housing, according to the San Diego Housing 
Trust Fund Coalition, a group of low-income housing advocates for the fund 
being proposed by the Housing Commission. The coalition estimates that 4,500 
new low-income units are needed annually in San Diego to keep up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
A Housing Commission study shows that most SRO tenants earn less than $15,000 a 
year, putting them in the "very low-income" category. (Housing experts define 
"low income" as 50% to 80% of median household income, and "very low" as 50% or 
less of the median household income. In San Diego, the median household income 
is $36,000.) 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to common belief, many of the people served by SROs are not unemployed 
transients, but workers who can't afford a studio apartment, the next step up 
in housing. Many of these are janitors, maids, dishwashers and day care 
providers essential to serving new downtown development, especially hotels and 
the soon-to-open convention center. 
</P>
<P>
Such people should be the prime target for low-income housing, not households 
making $18,000 and more, according to Jeanne Ertle of the Peace and Justice 
Commission of the San Diego Catholic Diocese. 
</P>
<P>
Developers who get Housing Commission financing to build SROs -- including 
loans made at interest rates as low as 3% -- must make 20% of their rooms 
available to people earning 40% or less of the median income. These rooms rent 
for about $240 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly half the 1,000 new SRO rooms in San Diego are commission-subsidized, 
according to Judy Lenthall, a senior city planner specializing in SROs, so new 
SROs are providing about 100 rooms for this rock-bottom income group, not 
nearly enough to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of low-income housing see new signs of hope for very low-income 
people in the proposed trust fund. There are many possible sources of money, 
including the "tax increment" dollars that flow when redevelopment increases 
property values, higher business license fees and assessments of 2% to 3% of 
the construction cost of new commercial developments downtown. The idea is to 
make those who profit the most from downtown development pay for housing the 
very low-income workers they often employ. 
</P>
<P>
The trust fund could be approved by the Housing Commission and the City Council 
before the end of the year, and could provide $10 million to $20 million 
annually for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're letting them know there is a real concern about the needs of low-income 
people on the bottom end of the housing crisis," said Ertle, who represents the 
diocese on the coalition. In the past, she said, the city has aimed for 
low-income and moderate-income groups whose income is much higher than those in 
the very low-income category. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Projects Well Designed 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest problems facing new low-income housing is the syndrome known 
as NIMBY, or "Not in My Back Yard." When low-income housing is proposed for a 
neighborhood, some people envision the Gargantuan, abandoned hulks built in New 
York and Chicago in the 1960s, rather than the more intimately scaled, 
well-designed projects of today. Architect Rob Quigley's design for The Baltic 
Inn at 521 6th Ave., for example, has been published in national design 
magazines and received an Honor Award in 1988 from the local chapter of the 
American Institute of Architects. 
</P>
<P>
But building design isn't the only, or even the major, concern for some SRO 
opponents. There's also the matter of who will live in them. 
</P>
<P>
City staff member Lenthall recently visited several community groups, including 
the Normal Heights Community Assn., to explain a new ordinance being drafted to 
govern the development of SRO-like buildings with slightly larger rooms 
designed more for couples than singles. In Normal Heights, the reception was 
less than warm, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it was definitely less than ecstatic," said Judy Elliot, community 
organizer for the planning group. She said the group was afraid that one of the 
new buildings might be proposed for Adams Avenue, in the heart of the 
community's business district, and that such projects are too dense for an 
already-dense part of the city. Many among the group also feared that such 
projects might attract the "bad element . . . drug dealing." 
</P>
<P>
Lenthall offered the group a tour of new SROs, to show them how nice they can 
be, but no one seemed interested, she said. According to Elliot, planning group 
members were simply too busy. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 11 and 12, the national AIA's Affordable Housing Task Group will 
sponsor an SRO workshop at the Horton Grand Hotel downtown, in conjunction with 
the local AIA chapter, the city Planning Department and the Housing Commission. 
But, with a cost of $220 for non-AIA members, it will appeal mostly to 
developers, bankers and architects, not a public in need of education. 
</P>
<P>
To date, architects have been noticeably quiet on the subject of low-income 
housing, although they are among the best qualified to explain to people how it 
can blend into existing neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Grochowiak is past president of the local AIA chapter and head of the AIA's 
Architectural Foundation, which puts on various events aimed at educating the 
public. Low-income housing hasn't been addressed recently, but Grochowiak 
acknowledged that in the future it should be a topic.

<P>
As befits an event associated with the Old Globe Theatre, moments of high drama 
and low comedy alternated at the "Fashion Gala '89" double-header given last 
week by the Globe Guilders. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion guru Bob Mackie starred both nights in a role that, given the degree to 
which he was lionized by the crowds, made him seem rather the early Christian 
of designers. Mackie bowed first at a private reception at a La Jolla estate 
given for the 200 top-ticket patrons and reprised his performance at the 
dramatic presentation of his fall collection on the Old Globe stage. His 
presence seemed diversion enough for most of the 500 who attended one or both 
events, but there were other extras, such as the sexiest ramp show ever given 
on a legitimate stage in San Diego and the back-stage scene that followed, 
during which several noted fashion plates tore through the racks of gowns in a 
race to stake the first claim on a particular number. 
</P>
<P>
Both evenings were declared very black tie in honor of Mackie, who -- despite 
his reputation as the designer of outrageous outfits for actress Cher, which he 
will wear forever as either crown or yoke -- contented himself with nothing 
more daring than a tuxedo with wide lapels and a polka dot tie. The 
sandy-haired couturier to the rich, the famous and the heavily mortgaged smiled 
endlessly, perhaps not least because so many women paid him the tribute of 
tripping up to him in, as they say, "a Mackie." 
</P>
<P>
One of these was Dottie Haggerty, who with her husband, Patrick, lent the use 
of their Chateau de Lorraine in La Jolla for the patrons' party. Dottie said 
the couple had carefully delineated chores to perform in preparation for the 
designer's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat spread Miracle Grow on the grass. Lots of Miracle Grow," she said. "My job 
was to lose 10 pounds, and you don't do that just for the postman." 
</P>
<P>
The Haggertys and the Guilders also provided their guests with a lavish 
cocktail spread, floral arrangements that included more than 600 exotic lavanda 
roses and a dance band called Tuxedo, but most guests danced attendance on 
Mackie. At one point, the designer turned to his hostess, gave her a generous 
hug and crooned, "Thanks so 
</P>
<P>
much for doing this. This is so nice!" 
</P>
<P>
Saks Fifth Avenue sponsored Mackie's presence and turned the tables somewhat by 
staging a show of men's furs, modeled by Globe principals and board members, at 
the patrons' reception. Among those pressed into perspiring service were Joe 
Jessop, Dr. Edgar Canada, Don McVay and Globe artistic director Jack O'Brien, 
who cheerfully admitted that his wide-lapeled tux was not a Mackie. "It's a 
Mickie," he teased. 
</P>
<P>
The evening ended on a doubly anticipatory note, not only for those who looked 
forward to the following night's show and gala dinner, but for those on the 
lookout for the airplane hired to buzz the Haggertys' gardens as a special 
salute to the patrons. It never arrived, although the pilot called later to 
explain that he had circled Pacific Beach for two hours looking for the house. 
Wrong neighborhood -- he should have let himself be guided by the glow of all 
those sequins reflecting in the setting sun. 
</P>
<P>
Mackie wore the same bow tie the following evening at the Globe, where he 
submitted to more mass adulation during the champagne reception before heading 
inside for the show. Among those singing his praises was event chair Anne 
Rifat. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't always expect someone of Mackie's artistic temperament to be 
delightful, but he's been a joy to work with. He's really a charming, cordial 
person." Rifat added after the show that organizing the event had cost her "a 
few tears," but said the result was worth it. "The show was so gorgeous. It was 
drama, it was theatre!" 
</P>
<P>
The show was in fact as theatrical as its setting, and at the end the audience 
leaped more readily to its feet than it has at some Globe productions. An 
unintentionally amusing moment came along during a segment that featured 
Zodiac-inspired creations, when the speakers burst out with "When You Wish Upon 
a Star" -- some of the clothes are priced in five figures, after all -- but the 
models also created racy moments when they shimmied in the shimmering gowns. 
Later, a model who travels the country working in Mackie presentations confided 
that "tonight was the night. Even in New York, we've never put on so exciting a 
show." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dinner at Museum 
</P>
<P>
The production set the mood for the following supper, which raced along at an 
unsuppressed pace at the San Diego Museum's Art Sculpture Garden. Arrangements 
of pampas grass waved in the light breeze like plumes on a Mackie headdress, 
and museum in-house caterer Barbara Mann was widely praised for serving an 
exceptional menu of lobster in gin-flavored mayonnaise, cold roast tenderloin 
with sauce raifort and purse-like pastries of meringue and mousse wrapped in 
white chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Mackie remained the center of attention to the end. A Globe staffer reported 
that immediately upon the conclusion of the show, several women had raced 
backstage to "attack" the clothes. "I'm sure Mackie sold a fortune's worth," 
said the staffer. 
</P>
<P>
The designer, meanwhile, just kept on smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Guilders president Yvonne Lindroth attended with her husband, Cliff; others 
were Katy and Michael Dessent, Jacque Powell, Evelyn Truitt, Alan and Gerri 
Fegarsky, Dolly and Jim Poet, Annette and Dick Ford, Martha and George Gafford, 
Audrey Geisel, Barbara Iredale, Sheri and Ben Kelts, Yvonne and Borys Orlowsky, 
Laurie and Dick Blackington, Lynn Townsend, and Elizabeth and Mark Kalish. 
</P>
<P>
The Society Club, the singles group that parties regularly in support of the 
American Cancer Society, evidently has come to the conclusion that bigger is 
better. 
</P>
<P>
The group staged its sixth annual "Chardonnay by the Bay" Saturday at the Kona 
Kai Club and attracted some 1,500 guests. Net proceeds were expected to exceed 
$45,000, or considerably in excess of the $4,400 netted by the 1984 inaugural 
event, which drew a crowd of 360. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more wineries, more restaurants, more donations -- we have more of 
everything than we've ever had before," crowed co-chair Paige Booth, who added 
that "Our guests should feel marvelous in the ambiance. This is a chance for 
them to wander through 55 wineries under San Diego skies." 
</P>
<P>
The setting included not just tables at which such wineries as Hart, Acacia and 
Rutherford Hill poured tastes of their best, but buffets loaded with snacks 
donated by more than 20 local restaurants and a nautical ambiance reinforced by 
the 14-foot Hobie sailboat that the committee launched in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
After six years, the party has its theme down pat, which is to say wine, women 
and men and song, more or less in that order. As always, guests were provided 
with "ice breakers" (wine labels printed with arcane vintages) which when 
matched by members of the opposite sex earned the couples door prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Guests also were given a sheet of wine tasting tips, which included such gems 
of information as "It is bad form to pour out a vintner's wine in front of him" 
(yes, indeed), and "Take a sip, and try to cover your tongue with the wine. You 
probably don't need to work it like mouthwash." 
</P>
<P>
Booth's co-chair, Craig Miles, said that proceeds are earmarked for cancer 
detection and education programs, and for the support of several East County 
camps that offer programs for cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included Joyce Almond, Ward Bennett, Mark Weisner, Barbara 
Kramer, Noel Meadows, Richard Krantzman, Susan Clifton, Joe Harmon, Theresa 
Castagneto, Laurie Lehman, Mario Ingrasci, Gail Gardner and Jim Hissong.

JACK SMITH: WITH GIRLS AND BOYS IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am not surprised to find some opposition to Mrs. Betty Fonteno's conclusion, 
from observing her twin grandchildren at play, that boys and girls 
instinctively favor different toys. 
</P>
<P>
Fonteno reported that her 16-month-old grandson sought out balls to play with 
and his twin sister sought out dolls. Fonteno also protested what she called a 
deliberate switching of sex roles in children's stories -- for example, a story 
in which the father bakes a pie. (I had to confess that I had never baked one.) 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps our copy editor put that column in the proper perspective when he or 
she wrote the headline: "A Half-Baked Theory on Sex Differences." 
</P>
<P>
Fonteno did receive some corroboration. Marion Kaelin writes that when her 
third son was born she brought home two dolls for the older boys, aged 4 and 2 
1/2. They went mostly untouched until 2 1/2 years later, when she had a 
daughter. "They made a big hit with her. Every store we entered she ran for the 
dolls -- no coaching needed." 
</P>
<P>
Of course the experiences of Fonteno and Kaelin hardly constitute scientific 
research. 
</P>
<P>
"Seemingly lighthearted articles such as yours," writes Pamela Dernham, RN, "do 
more to entrench rigid notions of sex-type behavior than all the pink and blue 
ribbons in the world." (I don't know that any comment has given me a greater 
sense of power.) 
</P>
<P>
"The experience of one grandmother who baby-sits and notices differences 
between what toys her grandchildren choose," she adds, "completely misses the 
point of 'free to be you and me' thought -- it doesn't matter if boys will more 
often choose the ball than the doll; some boys will choose the doll, and it 
should be their option to do so. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Morris notes that the subject has indeed been systematically 
researched: "Results suggest that what toys kids choose is powerfully 
influenced by socialization and that there has been a 'drift' over time, 
reflecting changes in cultural expectations regarding gender. 
</P>
<P>
"Moreover," she goes on, "much evidence indicates that the age from 18 months 
to three years is a 'critical period,' in the development of 'core gender 
identity,' that is, a time during which the child's basic concept of self in 
relation to gender jells and becomes permanent or close to it." 
</P>
<P>
She suggests that Fonteno's grandchildren were "precocious" in this respect, 
being only 16 months old, and that their precocity reflected their 
grandmother's perception. 
</P>
<P>
She does concede that there are some sex differences in development and 
interest that are widespread, persistent and consistent enough to suggest 
possible innate origins. "There are some. However such differences tend, 
generally, to be relatively small, to disappear entirely in some studies, and 
to be marked by considerable overlap across gender lines and by considerable 
individual variance." 
</P>
<P>
Which leaves us where? 
</P>
<P>
Morris objects to my use of the term feminist doctrine in this paragraph: "I 
believe feminist doctrine holds that girls' preferences for dolls and boys' for 
balls are the result of adult indoctrination, just as baby girls are made to 
wear pink booties and boys blue. 
</P>
<P>
"I know many men and women," she says, "who also consider themselves feminists. 
We often do not agree with each other on many issues, including the opinion 
that you blithely ascribed to 'doctrine.' Such inaccuracy and 
oversimplification encourages confusion and prejudice and is unworthy of a 
writer for one of the country's great newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
As a feminist, I would call that doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on my 25 years of experience as a counselor at Cal Poly Pomona," writes 
Ken Green, "I firmly believe that Betty Fonteno is right when she postulates 
that, from infancy, women and men reveal differences that are more a product of 
inheritance than a result of social conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
"This would account for the tendency, often observed, for a little girl to 
reach for a doll with whom she immediately establishes a relationship, and for 
a little boy to reach for a toy, and to inspect it in a way that suggests he 
wants to know how it works." 
</P>
<P>
Green says he knows that women are as intelligent as men, yet they often turn 
toward home and family, while men continue to strive for mastery. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder whether Morris would call that male chauvinist doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
I have received several letters from men who bake pies, but I doubt that their 
numbers are statistically significant.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE!: GIVING DESCENDANTS A PLACE IN HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA VANDERPOOL GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your family history is of little value unless you publish it so it can be 
shared with your family, your descendants and other genealogists. 
</P>
<P>
Publishing can be as simple as typing up the information you have gathered 
about your family (and, of course, you will have cited your sources properly) 
and making a few dozen photocopies of your manuscript to give to family members 
and particular libraries and archives, to having a real book printed. 
</P>
<P>
So many genealogists now own computers that the chore of writing a family 
history has been greatly diminished. If you also have software that will 
compile your genealogy in proper form, the agony of writing a genealogy has 
been eliminated. The work of your lifetime should be published in some form. 
After all, the story of your family is important; it's part of America's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding to publish your family history will force you to bring your research 
to some point of completion. Like most genealogists, you think you will 
research all your ancestors and then someday write the book. It never happens. 
Old age, sickness and other responsibilities often prevent us from doing a 
complete story about all our ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
Decide to publish what you have on a particular line or several lines. Then, 
after that goal is completed, begin preparing material for additional lines. 
Once you have decided to publish, set a long-term goal for this to be 
accomplished. It could be for a Christmas present in 1990, your parents' golden 
anniversary, or someone's birthday, but set a reasonable date. 
</P>
<P>
Next, explore publishing options and discuss printing problems with potential 
publishers. You will need to know what kind of book you want, what the costs 
will be, how many copies to publish, what methods of copy preparation are 
available, how to arrange text, pictures and documents on a book page, and how 
your finished book will look. Do you want a hardback or soft-cover? What will 
be its final price? 
</P>
<P>
Start by contacting local printers in your area (check the yellow pages). Many 
will print your book from what's called "camera-ready" pages and will work with 
you by showing you how your manuscript must be typed and arranged. They will 
give you an estimate of the cost based upon the number of pages in the book and 
the number of books to be printed and additional costs, such as screening of 
photographs and bindings or covers. Most genealogies or family history books 
are printed in limited numbers -- usually 100 to 200 copies. 
</P>

IT'S LEFT TURNS THAT SCARE THEM AT THE DMV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORENZO BENET, Benet is a Van Nuys free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It takes more than a score of 70 out of 100 points on the driving test to get a 
California license. 
</P>
<P>
A passing grade also requires that an applicant overcome an ailment common to 
most test takers: fear of licensing registration examiners. 
</P>
<P>
They are gruff, we've been told. They're all retired military men, we've heard. 
They bark their orders and never smile. 
</P>
<P>
Truth told, 60% of the state's 532 examiners are women. The uniforms and badges 
were scrapped in the 1970s and, according to Vince Hori, 40, assistant manager 
of the Department of Motor Vehicles' Van Nuys office, examiners have been told 
to smile more, loosen their collars and project a friendly, relaxed image. 
</P>
<P>
But that image is not always easy to project, given the conditions under which 
examiners must sometimes work. They are subject to auto accidents, insect 
attacks, dirty diaper odors and having their clothing stained with everything 
from coffee to urine. And many say drivers are getting worse. What follows are 
some of the war stories that can be heard in the Van Nuys branch of the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
With her curly white hair and glasses, Louise Ishmael, 61, looks like 
somebody's grandmother. Her outfit on a recent workday was bright and cheery -- 
a blue-and-white print blouse, white slacks and light blue Reebok tennis shoes. 
She says nine years on the job has taught her to dress down. 
</P>
<P>
"I give 20 to 30 tests a day," she said. "And we're exposed to all kinds of 
cars." 
</P>
<P>
For every air-conditioned and leather-seated Mercedes, there are many more 
heaps with all kinds of surprises in store for unknowing passengers. "The other 
day, I had to make the driver pull over and stop," she said. "There were these 
two white bugs crawling up my arm. I think they were lice." 
</P>
<P>
Every driving examiner has seen his or her share of dirty diapers, vomit and 
other nightmares littering front seats. "We laugh about these things later," 
Ishmael said. "It's a source of relief." (Another source of relief: The DMV 
provides smocks for the examiners.) 
</P>
<P>
From the moment that she tells an applicant that 70 points are the cutoff, 
Ishmael says she is on the alert for signs of anxiety -- shaky knees, sweaty 
brows and palms. "I tell them to relax and that they'll do fine if they know 
the laws," but she added that most examiners have a pretty good idea of who 
will pass -- and who won't -- by the time they leave the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Negative points can add up quickly. Change lanes without looking over your 
shoulder and you could lose four to eight points. Take a corner too quickly, 
stop in a crosswalk, fail to come to a complete halt at a stop sign -- all 
count as three- to six-point deductions. Fail to stop for an animal and you 
might be flunked for not "scanning for hazards." Running a stop sign or a red 
light, or pulling into oncoming traffic means an automatic fail. Applicants get 
three cracks at passing the driving test before they have to take the written 
exam again to earn another shot behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll do the darndest things," Ishmael said. "And then turn around and 
repeat those famous last words, 'Did I pass?' " 
</P>
<P>
"I have gotten quite serious over the years," she added. "When I started, I 
failed 25% of my drivers. Now it's more like one-third. This week has been bad; 
it has been about 50%. I urge people to practice and come back. But some make 
an appointment for the next day. I think they think it's all luck." 
</P>
<P>
Horror stories abound. 
</P>
<P>
"I went on one drive where this man kept making lane changes without looking 
over his right shoulder," Ishmael recalled. "I said, 'Why do you keep doing 
that?' He said, 'I can't see out of my right eye.' 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest fear is those left turns into oncoming traffic," she added, 
shaking her head. "That's when the passenger side is exposed." 
</P>
<P>
Examiners seem to believe that there is a high risk of accidents in the 
profession (one accident per 6,686 drives in California in 1988 for a total of 
175 accidents and 47 injuries), which tends to scare off potential candidates 
for a job that pays $1,800 to $2,200 a month. (Applicants must have two years 
of college or three years of work experience -- and a good driving record.) 
</P>
<P>
Hori, a department employee for 17 years, recalls that one examiner was killed 
10 years ago during an exam in Long Beach when the car collided with a bus. As 
recently as July 10, a Van Nuys examiner was injured when the applicant made a 
left turn in front of a car, which broadsided the vehicle. The examiner 
suffered minor arm and shoulder injuries and was back on the job two days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
(Dennis McKibben was not as fortunate. He broke his collarbone in December and 
was out five weeks after an applicant steered the car into a fire hydrant. The 
accident occurred just as they pulled out of the Van Nuys office parking lot, 
Hori said.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the headaches, Ishmael says she wouldn't trade her spot in the 
passenger seat for a chair behind the registration counter. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I took this job, I used to think you had to have a hole in your head to 
do this. I used to watch these applicants driving in, going over curbs, 
frightening pedestrians. But I like the contact with people. And it's an 
important job. I'm making the roads safe for others. 
</P>
<P>
Examiner Jan Moutes, dressed on a recent day in a green blouse and matching 
skirt, makes it a point to roll down the passenger side of the window the 
moment she gets inside a stranger's car. "Some people don't believe in personal 
hygiene," she said. "And this is the kind of test that makes people sweat." 
</P>
<P>
Examiners sweat too. "You deal with a lot of negativity," Moutes said. "In my 
two years, drivers seem to be getting worse. And when you fail them, some 
people want to argue, and they can get out of control. But I'm not one to take 
any nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
Moutes, 30, worked in a flower shop before joining the department six years ago 
as a clerk. She has been giving tests since 1987. From time to time, she says 
she feels resentment from male applicants who don't take kindly to failing 
grades administered by a woman. On the other hand, many women applicants appear 
relieved when they see Moutes climb into the car. 
</P>
<P>
Once Moutes failed an applicant who was just about to pass because the driver 
almost ran over someone pulling into the DMV parking lot. A well-heeled woman 
tried to slip Moutes a wad of bills to get a passing grade. Moutes declined. "I 
couldn't live with myself for putting an unsafe driver on the road for money," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
When she has a particularly rough day, Moutes feels fortunate to be able to 
turn to her fiancee for some empathy. 
</P>
<P>
"He understands what's out there -- he's a chauffeur." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bullock, 32, tells nervous applicants to take a deep breath and relax. 
Sometimes he has to follow his own advice. 
</P>
<P>
On one hair-raising day a couple of years ago, he had three near-miss 
accidents. One unnerved applicant hit the accelerator instead of the brake at a 
stop sign. Another made a right turn and never straightened out the wheel, 
jumping the curb. A third made a left turn into oncoming traffic, forcing 
Bullock to grab the wheel, pull up the hand brake and swerve the car to safety. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong?" the surprised applicant asked. "The car ahead of me turned so I 
did too." 
</P>
<P>
"People do the stupidest things," Bullock said. "I wish we had a section to 
take off points for stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
"The longer I was an examiner, the tougher I got," said Bullock, now in his 
fourth year -- two as a driving examiner -- with the department. "I started 
thinking about my own well-being. Would I want these people driving out on the 
street?" 
</P>
<P>
He has had a few "walk-backs," examiner jargon for those times when an examiner 
will drive no farther with an applicant. "If it's too dangerous, I'll just tell 
the driver to pull over and let me out. But those are the exceptions." 
</P>
<P>
Bullock turned in his examiner's badge seven months ago to accept a promotion 
to supervisor. (Typically, an examiner spends two to five years on the job.) 
Instead of giving 20 tests a day, he now does about three a month. Still, when 
he rides in any car, his head is on a swivel. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always looking around," he said. "I'm looking at cars coming at us, 
watching for lane changes." 
</P>
<P>
And, no doubt, driving his friends crazy.

WRESTLING WITH A PROBLEM OF THE AGES: YOUTH WITHOUT WHEELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

When Shana Rosengart threw a surprise 15th birthday party for classmate Matt 
Gainsley a few months ago, there was a complication: how to get 19 teen-agers 
from Matt's home in Encino to Disneyland and back. It took dozens of phone 
calls to work out the arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
When you're a teen-ager without a driver's license in the San Fernando Valley, 
it's not easy to get around. Some solutions to the problem are new; others are 
as old as the nearby canyons. 
</P>
<P>
For Shana's party, most of the teen-agers were delivered by their parents or by 
Shana's mother, Gerri, to Matt's or another classmate's home at 8 a.m. Then, a 
combination of private cars driven by some of the older teen-agers and two 
Shlep-a-Ride vans transported the group to the Anaheim amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the parents were not supportive of the idea of teen-agers driving," 
Gerri Rosengart said. "Instead, they were willing to pay $20 each for a round 
trip." 
</P>
<P>
Shlep-a-Ride, based in Studio City, operates 13 vehicles and is available 
around the clock with 24 hours' notice. The service is available to its 125 
annual members, and anyone else who pays in advance. A one-way trip within a 
10-mile radius costs $15, with a flat rate for groups. 
</P>
<P>
"People call us and say, 'We have 10 kids, and we want to go to the beach five 
days a week,' " said Shlep-a-Ride manager Augie Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
For the occasional trip to the mall or a friend's house, however, it's still 
Mom who does the major share of the transporting. 
</P>
<P>
Many have mixed feelings about the chore. Pearl Kaplan of Van Nuys, worried 
about the poor safety record of teen-age drivers, usually drives her 
16-year-old daughter, Melissa, everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not in a big rush for her to get her learner's permit," Kaplan said. "I'd 
rather drive her around for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Other parents welcome liberation. Gail Glickman has an 18-year-old daughter who 
drives and a 15-year-old daughter, Andrea. She is looking forward to the day 
Andrea can drive herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I live in the hills of Encino, and the thing about where I live is, it takes 
me 10 minutes to get down my hill to the boulevard," she said. "So the moment 
my first daughter turned 16, it was a necessity to get her a car. Because I was 
going absolutely out of my mind. I couldn't be in two or three places at once." 
</P>
<P>
When a parent is not available, teen-agers have to be resourceful. A bus is not 
usually their first choice. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said teen-agers think the bus "is so degrading." She continued, "I mean, 
they look at you like they want to die when you say, 'Take a bus.' " 
Nevertheless, her daughter has at times taken the RTD to the beach and to the 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Gross, 16, of Van Nuys said, "Four of us met at the Galleria in 
Sherman Oaks and took the RTD to the beach in Santa Monica." The trip took 
about an hour and required a transfer in Westwood. "It was hard to bring stuff 
on the bus. I wanted to bring a chair, but I didn't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some communities respond to teen-agers' need to spend hot summer days at the 
beach. In the Summer Beach Bus Program of the Agoura Hills Parks and Recreation 
Department, for example, a bus makes five round trips Monday through Saturday, 
carrying youngsters, most of them between 11 and 16, from several locations in 
Agoura Hills to Malibu Beach. The cost is 75 cents one way. 
</P>
<P>
The program has been operating since 1985. Said Audrey Brown, recreation 
superintendent: "It's been one of our most successful teen programs. Parents 
love it because they don't have to worry about taking their kids back and forth 
to the beach all the time, and they feel confident that it's a well-run 
program." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feet and Wheels 
</P>
<P>
What about those old standbys, walking and biking? Not uncommon is the attitude 
of Wendy Armstrong's daughter Cari Stafford, 14 1/2. "Cari relies on me or on 
other parents to get around," Armstrong said. "She has a bicycle. She refuses 
to ride it. Her feet won't walk more than two blocks." 
</P>
<P>
But it's not simply a matter of laziness. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in some areas, Cari's just afraid to be out on her own with the 
traffic and with the crazies," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic can be a serious problem. When Matt Gainsley was 14, he was hit by a 
car while on his bike. Though he was not hurt, his bike was badly damaged and 
the driver did not stop. Since then, according to his mother, "he really has 
gone sour" on riding his bike. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Fox, 14, who lives in Simi Valley, rides his bike up to five miles. On 
his own, he can get to the orthodontist and to two local schools, where he runs 
and plays tennis. Aaron admits that there is a drawback. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a two-lane strip of road getting to the local school from my house, 
and sometimes the drivers tend to cut it a little close. They speed by, which 
is annoying," he said. And there is the expense of maintaining the bike. 
</P>
<P>
Walking is also not without problems. Adele Gainsley's daughter Jessie, 13, is 
permitted to walk to the movies with a friend, less than a mile to Ventura 
Boulevard. However, Gainsley said, many parents do not allow their children to 
do that, even in daytime. 
</P>
<P>
"I would definitely not let her go at night. I don't even let Matthew walk 
around here at night," she added. Gainsley said she worries about rowdy 
behavior by gangs of teen-agers on Ventura Boulevard and in the less 
well-lighted streets south of the boulevard near her Tarzana home. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids now have a lot of fear," said Bobbi Vogel, a family therapist in Encino 
who often works with teen-agers. "Most have never been on the bus, and the ones 
that have, including teen-age boys, are so fearful of what they would call the 
weirdos." 
</P>
<P>
Vogel said she believes that such fear has been instilled in youngsters from 
the time they were in nursery school. "Kids being brought up in middle-class 
areas are not real street smart, and they're very fearful of dealing with 
elements that they're not comfortable with, like strangers." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Gross, Stephanie's mother, said she is the type of mother who drove her 
daughter everywhere, except for the very rare occasion the teen-ager took the 
bus. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there's a lot of people on the buses. You don't want to have a 
girl standing at a bus stop," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative to parent-as-chauffeur is to pay someone else to do the 
driving, which some families do regularly. Gail Glickman, whose daughter Andrea 
attends the Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies, pays a 12th-grader to 
drive Andrea to school and back home to Encino. A number of parents reported 
that the standard rate paid to a student driver is $1 each way per day. 
</P>
<P>
Cabs are sometimes used as a backup. Marjorie Marks of North Hollywood relied 
on them to get her son, Zachary, 12, to his orthodontist in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
"He would call another cab when he was ready to come home," Marks said. "But I 
always worried." 
</P>
<P>
In the minority is Eric Ross, 16. He and his friends use skateboards to get 
around. "The farthest I ever skated was from my house in Tarzana to Venice 
Beach. Somebody worked out a route for us, through the canyons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Safety aside, there are a few disadvantages: Some eating places will not allow 
skateboarders inside, and Ross once got a $13 ticket for skateboarding on the 
campus of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Events 
</P>
<P>
Special occasions call for special means of transportation. Teen-agers commonly 
hire chauffeured limousines at $225 for five hours to get to proms. Despite its 
expense, some parents prefer it to having their offspring driven by another 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"When Stephanie goes to her prom, I may go for the limo, because I may not know 
the boy who's driving," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan rented a double-stretch limo that seated 10 to take her twin daughters, 
Dawn and Danielle, to their prom. "They invited boys and shared the limo with 
two other girls and their dates, so I had to pay half," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan's daughters also recently attended a prom at another school. This time 
their dates and seven other couples rented a recreational vehicle with a 
chauffeur. It cost $700 for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
When Glickman's 18-year-old daughter, Hillary, graduated from Birmingham High 
School in June, they wanted to do something special for her prom. "She's not 
really a limo-type person. My husband thought it would be a lot of fun to go in 
an old classic car. So we rented her a red and white 1968 Ford convertible from 
National," Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost is highest the first time, since a $60 a-year membership fee is 
required. Such a car rents for $50 per day plus 30 cents a mile. "I think that 
in our affluent society, children are growing up where a limo is no big deal. 
She loved it, and everybody talked about her," Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, her 15-year-old has rented a limo a couple of times with 
four or five other girls because they were going to a fancy party. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not cool to have your parents pick you up, and it's not that expensive if 
everybody shares," Glickman said.

The Children of Crisis Foundation, a newly formed charity, will benefit from 
tonight's performance of the Bolshoi Ballet Academy at the Pantages Theatre. 
Classical Artists International, which is sponsoring the academy's six-week 
tour, and the Nederlander Organization donated 500 tickets, which are being 
sold at $250 apiece to benefit Armenian children who were orphaned or disabled 
by last December's devastating earthquake. ALEENE MacMINN

Pat Harvey, an anchorwoman at Chicago superstation WGN-TV and formerly at CNN, 
will be coming aboard KHJ-TV Channel 9 here to help anchor the station's 
three-hour prime-time newscast, scheduled to premiere next year. Harvey will 
join local news personalities Jerry Dunphy and Larry Carroll, previously 
announced for the Disney-owned station's expanded news staff. If, as expected, 
she is given a permanent anchor spot when she arrives at the station in 
October, she would become the only black weekday anchor in Los Angeles. KHJ-TV 
also reportedly is wooing former KABC-TV and KCBS anchor Terry Murphy and 
KABC-TV sportscaster Jim Hill. The future of the station's current anchors -- 
Lonnie Lardner, Tom Lawrence, Linda Edwards and sportscaster Scott St. James -- 
is yet to be determined. ALEENE MacMINN

"West 57th" correspondent John Ferrugia is leaving New York to become co-anchor 
on Denver's KCNC Channel 4 "Colorado Evening News" beginning Sept. 11. 
Ferrugia, 38, signed a multiyear contract with KCNC, reportedly worth about 
$200,000 a year. Ferrugia told the Denver Post that he was making the move in 
order to spend more time with his family. He said he was on the road 21 days in 
January and 19 days in February and was working a 70-hour week. ALEENE MacMINN

MONTREAL SYMPHONY, CONDUCTOR CHARLES DUTOIT RETURN TO BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of our colleagues once described the Montreal Symphony's playing as lean, 
clean and uninhibited -- and so it is. Two years after the orchestra's 
Hollywood Bowl debut, the Montrealers, under their justifiably adored music 
director Charles Dutoit, have returned to the Bowl. They will be there, 
nightly, through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
There were moments of lost focus, temporary intonational distress and overthin 
string tone during this first program -- Berlioz's "Corsaire" Overture, Brahms' 
Violin Concerto, Debussy's "Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune" and Mussorgsky's 
"Pictures at an Exhibition." But, for the most part, the touring musicians of 
Montreal gave a splendid performance on Tuesday, one confirming both their 
present international reputation and our memories of their first Bowl visit. 
</P>
<P>
The sounds produced by the orchestra remain French: neither round nor heavy, 
but slender, wiry, flexible and colorful. As an expressive instrument, the 
ensemble has many resources, all of which Dutoit utilizes sensitively and 
without overindulgence. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he matches device to score, and balances musical architecture with 
specific details. In the virtuosic Berlioz piece, he whipped up excitement and 
a fine frenzy, all the while maintaining rhythmic control and a virtually 
immaculate musical line. 
</P>
<P>
He and the orchestra accomplished nearly as much -- some untuned chords and 
wayward attacks aside -- in Mussorgsky's popular suite, which hadn't been heard 
at the Bowl in all of six days. 
</P>
<P>
But the crowning glory of this first program was the lush, transparent and 
sensuous performance the Montreal band turned in of Debussy's impressionistic 
tone-poem. Here, all elements cohered, maintained their balance and produced 
aural magic in a most unforced yet compelling reading. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-program, Pinchas Zukerman -- a virtuoso violinist who has wandered other 
paths but still makes his most pointed artistic contributions in his original 
role -- gave a strong and clear-eyed account of the Brahms Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
This reading was so articulate and well-spoken that it seemed to become not the 
usual tremendous challenge to virtuosity, but a serious and low-key musical 
conversation between friends. In other words, refreshing and provocative. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance: 10,308.

DESPITE INFIGHTING AND AN ANTI-NEW YORK BIAS, THE STATE'S VINTNERS ARE AGAIN 
MAKING REMARKABLE WINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

PENN YAN, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are as many opinions about New York's wine as there are observers of it. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Trezise says "viticultural racism" is the New York wine industry's major 
problem. He refers to the fact that some of the state's best wines are made 
from non-classical hybrid grapes such as Seyval and Cayuga, which once were the 
only grapes used to make wine here. It wasn't great wine. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Wesson speaks of an anti-New York wine bias among restaurateurs and 
retailers as the greatest problem facing New York wines. Despite recent 
improvements in the quality of the state's wines, the image of New York's 
industry was formed in past years when some rather mawkish "yuck" was being 
made here. See related "About Wine" column on Page 19. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Palmer says that infighting between the different wine-growing regions 
of the state exists and that some New York winery owners -- notably he and his 
neighbors on Long Island -- "pretend we're not even in New York." 
</P>
<P>
All this confusion facing the New York wine industry is a continuation of 
longstanding problems for this divergent wine-growing region and leads to the 
fact that New York wine gets no respect in its own land. 
</P>
<P>
Yet everyone agrees that New York wines have improved dramatically in the past 
few years and that the disparate elements in the New York wine industry, 
strident though they may be today, may yet coalesce for one rousing charge into 
the headlines. 
</P>
<P>
As wine quality soars, as the number of wineries increases and as enthusiasm 
moves to an all-time high, one element makes New York a wine region to watch in 
the coming years: The New York Wine and Grape Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Headed by Trezise, its energetic president, the foundation sends out reams of 
promotional copy touting the four major wine-growing regions of the state; it 
uses attractive brochures showing how New York wines go with food and how New 
York wine fits the current upscale life style of Americans who are drinking 
less but better. 
</P>
<P>
Trezise's press kit, using the slogan "Uncork New York," alone weighs 1 pound, 
6 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting on his porch overlooking Lake Keuka, Trezise sips a glass of Hunt 
Country Chardonnay and admits that consumers can't yet find a bottle of New 
York wine in many of the better restaurants in New York City, or in many of the 
better wine shops. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's changing," he says. "People are becoming more aware of what we're 
doing here. The funny thing is, the word is getting to the rest of the world 
faster than it is right here, in the Finger Lakes." 
</P>
<P>
The Finger Lakes region in Upstate New York west of New York City is the 
state's largest wine region, and one that for decades was home to 
French-American hybrid grapes -- grapes developed to withstand the rigors of 
bitter winters but that did not have the potent, grapey smell and taste of 
native American varieties such as Concord, which had been the base of sweet, 
kosher wine for decades. 
</P>
<P>
The late Dr. Konstantin Frank, a viticultural pioneer, encouraged the use of 
the French vitis vinifera varieties such as Chardonnay, Riesling and Pinot Noir 
in New York, arguing that they could be grown to withstand the harsh winters 
and that they could ripen properly, even in the hottest and most humid days of 
a New York summer. 
</P>
<P>
Frank won a number of growers over to his beliefs, and today the Finger Lakes 
is a region with no single identity. Chardonnay grows side by side with Seyval. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Finger Lakes region still has some of the old native American 
varieties such as Concord and Niagara that give such an intense aroma that they 
bother even some jelly and grape juice users. The region also has many of the 
hybrid varieties such as Seyval, Baco and Cayuga that dominated through the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But it also has more vinifera varieties than ever before, and plantings are 
growing. And its Chardonnay and Riesling are opening eyes around the world, as 
did a 1988 Wagner Riesling at a recent Riesling conference in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Finger Lakes has a three-grape image and a past replete with 
mediocre wine has given Long Island, east of New York City, the impetus it 
needs to make its presence felt as the East Coast version of the Napa Valley. 
And Long Island has risen rapidly in the image department. 
</P>
<P>
Long Island's vinifera tradition, with Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and 
the other traditional grape varieties, began in 1973 when Alex Hargrave 
pioneered the region, planting the classic French varieties amid potato farms 
and undeveloped land. In the years since, a dozen others have joined Hargrave 
on Long Island, and the area has slowly added more and more acreage, almost all 
of it in the traditional French varieties. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a native Long Islander," said Palmer, a broadcast advertising executive 
and the owner of Palmer Vineyards. "I love wine, and I thought we could make 
great wine out here." But when he bought his land a decade ago, he was one of 
few to have such a dream; it was then still considered a remote prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"But I figured, if it can't be done, I'll still be sitting on a lot of land 
that will be worth a lot of money some day," Palmer added. 
</P>
<P>
Thus did Long Island become home to a number of wealthy men determined to 
garner plaudits for traditional varieties. "Long Island is a rich man's toy," 
said one wine maker from the Hudson Valley, without batting an eye. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even in Long Island, a new region, infighting is already apparent. When one 
local grower decided to plant one of the hybrid varieties, he was cursed by his 
neighbors as being a heretic. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in their zeal to remove themselves emotionally from New York, Long 
Islanders have alienated some in the Finger Lakes region. "We are not in New 
York, this is Long Island," one islander said. Trezise, hearing that, 
shuddered. "That sure doesn't help statewide unity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of Oldest Wine Regions 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of all this sits the Hudson Valley, a peaceful region tucked into 
rolling hills midway between Albany and New York City. It is one of the oldest 
wine-growing regions in America (it has the oldest continuing vineyard and 
oldest winery), and it has found its niche with the French-American hybrid 
grapes. 
</P>
<P>
It's also the wine district closest to New York City, so it has the greatest 
potential as a tourist spot -- when New Yorkers discover they have their own 
wine country close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Miller is the true symbol of the entire wine industry in New York. He is 
71, an artist of world fame and for the last 18 years a wine maker here. He 
says there's no confusion among most Hudson Valley wineries about which wines 
to make. The hybrid grapes are best because they make fine wines that offer a 
refreshing alternative to the wines of France and California, he feels. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure we should say we're 'stuck with' the hybrid varieties," Miller 
said. "Every region of the world has a distinct characteristic, and I think the 
differences are a great virtue." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his neighbors are experimenting with vinifera grapes, but Hudson 
Valley's main contribution is in making, with the hybrids, wines with a degree 
of style as impressive as any in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Miller is a voice of moderation and reason in an industry filled with turmoil 
and conflict; he has strong ties in Albany, the state capital, and with Gov. 
Mario Cuomo's office, and Miller could be the catalyst that will help heal any 
superficial cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting out west, by its lonesome, is the Lake Erie district, where wine making 
has just begun to take hold. Half a dozen wineries are headed by Woodbury 
Vineyards, which has made some of the better vinifera wines in the region and 
also is making viticultural advances that will help the entire industry. 
</P>
<P>
"When you taste the wines, I think you'll see something," said Trezise, an 
evenhanded man who nevertheless is intense and effusive about New York's 
improving wine quality. "Everyone, from Lakewood to Taylor, has improved, and 
that's because we understand the grapes better than we ever did." 
</P>
<P>
The small of it is Lakewood, owned by Monty Stamp and his family. It is the 
newest winery in the state, having opened its doors (to an unpaved parking lot) 
on Lake Keuka a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We produce 350 tons of grapes and we used to sell to Taylor," said Stamp, 
whose family has grown wine grapes here since 1951. "They paid top dollar, but 
in the last few years we've seen an erosion of market prices. And we had hoped 
for a better return. So we opened the winery." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Lakewood will produce about 2,000 cases of wine. 
</P>
<P>
The largest winery in the state, and the oldest in the Finger Lakes (founded 
1880), is Taylor-Great Western (which also markets wine under the Gold Seal 
label). The long heritage here has been with native grapes, mostly in jug wines 
and more recently with the hybrids. Only in the last few years has this giant 
switched to vinifera. 
</P>
<P>
"For years and years we've been paying the electric bill with non-vinifera," 
said Steve Coon, Taylor's senior wine maker who has been at the huge (28 acres 
under roof) Hammondsport winery for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
"By adding vinifera, we're opening up our line to another type of consumer," 
one looking for more traditional tastes, he said. Still, just 1% of the firm's 
2-million-case production is in vinifera. 
</P>
<P>
However, when a Great Western dessert wine won a sweepstakes award at a recent 
major wine competition, it gained more publicity for the property than it could 
have gotten for a carload of Niagara. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in New York City, a potentially huge market for the state's wines: "No 
matter how good they are -- and they're getting better all the time -- they get 
no respect here," said Wesson, a master sommelier and executive editor of "Wine 
and Food Companion." 
</P>
<P>
"The New York restaurant scene is dominated by Frenchmen who are still rather 
loathe to use any American wine, let alone a New York wine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Zraly, head of the hugely successful wine program at Windows on the World 
at the World Trade Center, carries four New York wines. All are vinifera. "It's 
hard to sell a Seyval, no matter how great it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the newer wineries in the state are family owned; there's little 
corporate interest in New York, at least not for start-up operations. The 
reasons are clear: image and the viticultural problems of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Bill Wagner, a longtime grower whose vineyard sits just off Lake Seneca, 
points out that only in the last 20 years or so "have (growers) figured out the 
keys to growing (vinifera) grapes here, and one thing we've learned is that we 
have to be close enough to the lakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're right off Seneca, the deepest of all the Finger Lakes, and it has never 
frozen in the winter," the white-haired Wagner said. "Also, this vineyard is 
(near) the deepest part of the lake." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner's 350 acres of land, much of it wooded, has 130 acres planted to grapes 
and a large percentage in vinifera. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner had a dairy in the area in the 1950s, then began to grow hybrid grapes 
in 1965. Encouraged by Frank, Wagner was one of the first to plant vinifera on 
a large-scale basis, and today his winery makes more than a dozen wines, all of 
character. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiting for the Tourists 
</P>
<P>
Visitors haven't found the Finger Lakes region yet. Glenora, a new, modern 
winery, stages concerts on the lawn outside its tasting room, overlooking 
Seneca to the east, and Gene Pierce, general manager, said the winery had 
31,000 visitors to its tasting room last year. 
</P>
<P>
This is a far cry from the hundreds of thousands that visit wineries in the 
Napa Valley each year. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of visitors is rising, and I'm seeing a lot more enthusiasm from 
folks coming from New York City," Piere said. 
</P>
<P>
Trezise points out, however, that whereas Napa is a 90-minute drive from San 
Francisco, the Finger Lakes district is more than five hours from Manhattan. 
And when you get to little Penn Yan at the north end of Lake Keuka, home of the 
world's record buckwheat pancake, the culinary excitement is a Pizza Hut. 
</P>
<P>
As for the drive to Long Island, from New York City it's at least two hours 
(without traffic) and there there's little more than small cafes when you get 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"No, we haven't developed real wine country tourist traffic yet," said Trezise, 
but he adds that perhaps in a few years, when recognition for the wines grows, 
folks will discover what New York's wine country regions have to offer. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Hudson Valley, just 90 minutes north of Manhattan, offers the 
closest thing to a wine touring area that's convenient to most locals. With 
more than a dozen wineries, including Benmarl &amp; Brotherhood, which bills 
itself as "The Nation's Oldest Winery" (founded 1839), Hudson also has two of 
what Mark Miller says are the most warming elements about the New York State 
wine industry. 
</P>
<P>
One is Millbrook winery, owned by John Dyson, a wealthy former New York 
commissioner of agriculture. The other is Gary Gross' Walker Valley Vineyards. 
"He's one of the most outstanding wine makers in the state. Wait till you see 
what he can do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vines, Not Tract Homes 
</P>
<P>
Miller sat in his office recently, looking down the slope over his vines toward 
the Hudson River, and said he would never let the winery be sold for housing. 
"I could get $50,000 an acre for this place," he said, "but I'll never let it 
go for that." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has looked around for buyers who will agree to keep the place 
operating as a winery, but he has had few takers. Now, he says, he's looking to 
donate the winery and vineyards to a major university, if it will commit to 
keeping the winery operating, if it will agree to give his old vines the tender 
care they require. 
</P>
<P>
"This property is a symbol of my life, but it also represents the New York wine 
industry and its heritage. I never want to see housing where the vines are," he 
says.

Question: Where does one get the "Ball Blue Book, The Guide to Home Canning and 
Freezing?" 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The book is available from Ball Corp., Box 2005, Muncie, Ind. 
47307-0005. Price of $3.50 includes postage and handling. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What formula is used to substitute honey for sugar in recipes? One would 
imagine that it might be different for various foods, but there must be a rule 
of thumb that one could use. 
</P>
<P>
A: According to information from the California Honey Advisory Board, recipes 
especially created and tested for honey give the best results. In recipes that 
call for no more than one cup sweetening, however, one may replace the cup of 
sugar or syrup with one cup of honey. If the recipe calls for additional 
liquid, omit one-quarter cup. When baking is required, reduce the oven 
temperature by 25 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Recently The Times ran a recipe calling for mirin. Please define this 
ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
A: "The Von Welanetz Guide to Ethnic Ingredients" (Warner Books, 1987: $10.95) 
by Diana and Paul Von Welanetz describes mirin as: "a sweet, syrupy rice wine 
(that) is an essential Japanese ingredient, and is used to flavor perhaps half 
of all Japanese dishes -- as a seasoning, as a cooking ingredient and as a 
glaze for cooked dishes. You can make an acceptable substitute by cooking 
together equal parts of sake (or even Sherry or white wine) and sugar to make a 
syrup, though several Japanese cooks have advised us to simply substitute one 
teaspoon of sugar for each tablespoon of mirin called for." 
</P>
<P>
Mirin is available at Japanese markets and in the Oriental sections of some 
supermarkets.

REFINING EFFORTS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW BEEF, RAISIN AD CAMPAIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the seafood industry was celebrating its first national advertising 
campaign, two other commodity groups were refining highly visible promotional 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The Beef Industry Council has announced that its next series of commercials 
will feature regular people from towns with odd names. The format is a 
departure for the "Beef: Real Food for Real People" ads that in the past have 
used film, television and sports stars. Some of those who made sales pitches 
for the council were James Garner, Cybil Shepherd, Lauren Bacall, Larry Bird 
and country singer Reba McIntire. 
</P>
<P>
The original campaign, launched in 1986, was considered a success, according to 
a trade newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
The new commercials, scheduled to begin airing in October, will "show slices of 
life featuring real people . . . doing the things they do everyday in a few 
small American towns with cute names," according to Lean Trimmings, published 
by the Western States Meat Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the locales filmed for the series are Utopia, Tex., Luck, Wis., and 
Yale, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On a Different Tack 
</P>
<P>
Taking a somewhat different tack is the California Raisin Advisory Board. The 
group announced last week that a new set of commercials featuring the cartoon 
raisin characters have been filmed. But in this series, pop star Michael 
Jackson will be portrayed by one of the raisins. The spot received its first 
public viewing in 5,700 movie theaters last week. 
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of Jackson with the wildly popular dancing raisins came about 
because the singer/dancer was fascinated by the dried grapes as well as by the 
Claymation process used to create them. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's cartoon alter-ego will be the first celebrity in the series, and his 
character has been named "Michael Raisin," according to the advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge, the commercial's producers claim, was to capture Jackson's 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials are scheduled for network television in September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raisins vs. Cranberries 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated matter, the California Raisin Advisory Board is not flattered 
by what it claims is an attempt by cranberry growers to cash in on the 
popularity of the dancing raisins. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute centers around Ocean Spray's new product, Craisins. The dried 
cranberry snack was introduced this summer, according to California Farmer 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The raisin advisory board has complained that Craisins will confuse consumers 
and hurt sales of raisins. 
</P>
<P>
"The dehydrated cranberry's name plays on (the word) raisin in an unfair 
attempt to capitalize on the raisin advisory board's hard-won success with the 
dancing raisins," the magazine reports. 
</P>
<P>
Also of concern is that consumers may eat a Craisin and think it's an inferior 
raisin. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Spray maintains that their product does not infringe upon the dancing 
raisins and that there is room in the marketplace for more than just one dried 
fruit.

A PEP RALLY FOR FISH AD CAMPAIGN; 
</P>
<P>
BOOSTERS GATHER AT BILTMORE TO CHEER TELEVISION COMMERCIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The seafood industry's first national advertising campaign was previewed in a 
pep rally-like atmosphere in downtown Los Angeles last week. 
</P>
<P>
The 200 processors, wholesalers and retailers present at the Biltmore Hotel for 
the event enthusiastically applauded a screening of the television commercials 
that will urge Americans to eat more seafood. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign, conceived by the National Fish and Seafood Promotional Council, 
was warmly received by the audience. In fact, the group even stood and chanted 
the campaign's slogan, "Eat Fish and Shellfish Twice a Week," when encouraged 
by one of the evening's speakers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Generically Promoted 
</P>
<P>
Some in attendance called the effort the "best thing that has ever happened" to 
the highly segmented and diverse industry. The scene was duplicated, with 
varying degrees of intensity, in 16 other cities around the country during the 
past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The program marks the first time that fish and shellfish have been generically 
promoted in broadcast and print media. Among other things, the campaign hopes 
to stem a one year decline in per capita consumption of fishery products that 
occurred in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At present, Americans eat about 15 pounds of seafood annually; a figure that 
translates into about a one (one-quarter-pound) serving a week. The campaign's 
goal is to increase this level by 100%, or more, among people who are already 
in the habit of buying and preparing fish. 
</P>
<P>
According to research conducted by the council, there seems to be plenty of 
room for growth. Only 4% of the meals eaten in the home feature seafood, 
according to polling data provided by the council. The figure jumps 
significantly, however, for meals eaten out of the home at restaurants, fast 
food counters and other locations. At least 20% of these meals, the report 
states, include fish or shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funding Deadline 
</P>
<P>
The federally funded council will spend $6.5 million during the current 
promotion. The effort will purchase air time in October -- designated as 
National Seafood Month -- and 1990's Lenten season, which encompasses February 
and March. A cartoon character, the Sturgeon General, will preside over the ads 
and is introduced as "America's Official Spokesfish." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can increase seafood consumption with these efforts," said Dixie 
Blake, marketing manager for San Diego-based Ocean Garden Products Inc. and 
also a member of the seafood promotional council. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm that greeted the presentation, however, may be short-lived. The 
quasi-governmental council plans to ask individual seafood firms to fund the 
program when government monies run out in the fall of 1990. Other commodity 
groups that promote their food products -- beef, pork, raisins, strawberries -- 
do not use federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
"You've been given a free ride," Blake told the audience. "There are not likely 
to be any additional funds from Congress (to extend the program beyond October, 
1990)." 
</P>
<P>
The advertising campaign, in the works since 1987, comes at an appropriate time 
for the fisheries industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been beaten down pretty good the past few years with increased 
government regulations, supply fluctuations and negative publicity (over 
potential contamination)," she said. "This program is a confidence builder for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Although the promotional budget for seafood is a fraction of that allocated for 
beef or pork, Blake believes that fish processors have aesthetic advantages 
over some other protein sources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Golden Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
"We now have an opportunity to show how beautiful fish is," she said. "But the 
guy in a slaughterhouse with a cow carcass can't really show how great beef is, 
nor can someone in a chicken plant holding up a broiler." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the seafood council will be hard pressed to make a lasting impression 
on viewers with only $6.5 million to purchase expensive time on radio, cable or 
network television. The group is hoping the "likable" Sturgeon General cartoon 
character will help cut through the advertising clutter nonetheless, Blake 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The council will also economize by advertising only in those regions of the 
country where seafood consumption is the highest, such as in the Pacific Coast, 
Northeast and New England regions. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the seafood advertising campaign will be a promotional effort to 
reassure consumers about numerous seafood safety questions that have been 
raised by the industry's critics. This program, titled "Navigating Trouble 
Waters," is being coordinated by the National Fisheries Institute, a trade 
group with 1,000 corporate members. 
</P>
<P>
The institute hopes to blunt the often repeated criticism that there is little 
federal inspection of fishery products. As a result, the group has endorsed 
Congressional legislation that would establish a government oversight program 
for all seafood products to replace the current system of infrequent or 
haphazard safety reviews. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong PR Effort 
</P>
<P>
The promotional activities will also attempt to get the industry's message 
across to the news media and consumers. Additional efforts are designed to 
educate food retailers about proper handling of fish being sold in 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
"We have expanded our public relations efforts to blunt the negative criticism 
we've received," said Clare Vanderbeek, vice president of the National 
Fisheries Institute. "Now we will expand it further to restore consumer 
confidence in our products. We need to bolster confidence that may have been 
hurt by misinformation in the media. But we also realize that there are some 
real problems in this industry."

CULINARY SOS: GRAPE-NUTS PUDDING, A LONGTIME FAVORITE, COMBINES CAKE AND 
CUSTARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: Recently, someone requested a recipe from a Grape-Nuts package. I am 
enclosing one from an old cereal box my grandmother saved. 
</P>
<P>
My grandmother made this often and we like it very much. I don't know how old 
it is, but my grandmother would be 123 if she were alive. 
</P>
<P>
 -- S.G. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR S.G.: The Grape-Nuts pudding, which is cake-like on top and custard-like 
underneath, probably has its roots in an old classic going back to the early 
days in America. 
</P>
<P>
However, evidence of its use by a food company appeared in the Postum Cereal 
Co. publication called "75 Ways to Enjoy a Famous Food" in 1929. It was placed 
on the Post cereal package label in 1967. A repeat performance appeared in 
March of 1987 and the pudding is still going strong. 
</P>
<P>
Grape-Nuts, the wheat-barley cereal developed by Charles William Post in 1903, 
was the first ready-to-eat cereal to be put on the market. The name was derived 
from the baking process, which created a toasty, nutty flavor, said Mark 
O'Brien, a consumer communications spokesman for General Foods Corp. in White 
Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
GRAPE-NUTS PUFF PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs, separated 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup Grape-Nuts 
</P>
<P>
1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
Cream or whipped cream 
</P>
<P>
Cream lemon zest and butter until well blended. Add sugar gradually and cream 
together until light and fluffy. Add lightly beaten egg yolks and beat well. 
</P>
<P>
Add lemon juice, flour, Grape-Nuts and milk, mixing well. (Mixture will look 
curdled but this will not affect finished pudding.) 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg whites until stiff and fold into batter. Turn into 3-cup round greased 
baking dish and place in pan of hot water. Bake at 325 degrees 1 hour, 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
When done, pudding has cake-like layer on top and custard below. Serve warm or 
chilled with plain or whipped cream. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: If desired, 1/2 cup honey may be substituted for sugar. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: On a recent stop at Jean, Nev., we were served stuffed veal birds, 
which were delicious. I would like the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- THERESA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR THERESA: Paupiettes de Veau is a classic dish in the French cuisine. The 
rolls are stuffed with ham and cheese and baked in a tomato sauce with olives. 
</P>
<P>
PAUPIETTES DE VEAU 
</P>
<P>
(Veal Rolls) 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds veal cutlet 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound ham, minced 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs, beaten 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup minced parsley 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons minced onion 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, crushed 
</P>
<P>
1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
Sliced black olives, optional 
</P>
<P>
Have meat cut into thin slices. Pound slices very thin with mallet or cleaver. 
Mix ham, cheese, eggs, parsley and onion. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Spread veal slices with mixture. Roll carefully and tie each with string. 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil, butter and garlic in heat-proof casserole on top of range. When 
butter is melted add veal rolls and brown lightly, turning carefully. Add 
tomato sauce and wine. 
</P>
<P>
Cover and bake at 325 degrees 45 minutes to 1 hour or until veal is tender. 
Just before serving, add olives to sauce. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: My boyfriend has asked me to bake a Broken-Glass cake for him. He 
says that it has many different flavors of gelatin and that the gel part is 
crunchy. Please help. I can't find this recipe anywhere, and you are my best 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARTA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MARTA: It so happens that Broken-Glass Cake is an old-time favorite 
developed when flavored gelatin products came on the market. The multicolored 
gelatin squares make this a festive cake for special occasions. 
</P>
<P>

MY BEST RECIPE: FRESH CLAMS OVER RICE A MEXICAN FAVORITE THAT'S SOLID MAIN DISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Tito Higuera de Davis in Loreto, Mexico, served me the following dish and I 
pressed her for the recipe, which she says is a regional dish," Burt Sauer 
writes. "She used huge fresh clams, known locally as callos, that are found in 
shallow water around the nearby island of Catalina. Any chopped clam, conch or 
mussel can be used, but I use canned minced clams as an economical substitute 
that I can always have ready for a delicious main dish on short notice."

RECIPES HELP CELEBRATE NISEI WEEK IN LITTLE TOKYO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nisei Week, which starts Saturday and continues until Aug. 13 in Little Tokyo, 
will take you to Japan without having to fly there. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a full week of street food-tasting that will match any on a 
country road in Japan. Imagawa yaki (fried bean cakes), sushi and yaki-tori 
(fried kebabs) are but some of the typical foods of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
You may also find kushi-age, which is much like yaki-tori, except the foods are 
breaded before frying and are served with dipping sauces or lemon juice. 
</P>
<P>
Nisei Week, a celebration created by second generation Japanese (Nisei means 
second generation) to foster good will and good business in their community, is 
packed solidly with events, ranging from cooking demonstrations, art exhibits, 
a car show, karate, kendo, aikido and iaido as well as other Japanese martial 
arts demonstrations, a 5-K run and musical entertainment, including the Fujika 
Quintet. There is no Nisei Week, however, without the coronation of the Nisei 
Week Queen and ball -- which kick off the festivities on Saturday -- or the 
parade at 4 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But the food traditions are direct copies of those in Japan. Most of the street 
foods are considered fast food because they are generally made on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, yaki-tori, skewered bits and pieces of meat, fish or poultry, are 
marinated for several hours but cooked to order by the street vendor (or 
restaurant chef). Maki sushi (rolled sushi) is made on the spot to customers' 
order, as is temaki sushi (seasoned rice and other foods wrapped in seaweed). 
</P>
<P>
You will find imagawa yaki vendors preparing little flat cakes filled with soy 
bean paste in cylindrical vats, much as one would make waffles. Then there is 
the cooling taste of shaved ice cones topped with strawberry or lime syrup that 
delight children and adults alike. 
</P>
<P>
Nisei Week began 49 years ago in Little Tokyo to help second generation 
Japanese Americans generate business in the Little Tokyo community. The first 
festival included a poster contest, essay contest, some radio broadcasts, a 
fashion show and various exhibits including a parade through the streets of 
Little Tokyo. The following year, a beauty pageant, with a queen chosen by vote 
was added. 
</P>
<P>
Today's princesses are nominated by community organizations. The festival 
ceased when Japanese-Americans were interned in camps during World War II but 
resumed in 1949. Today hundreds of volunteers from community organizations help 
promote and work in the Nisei Week program. The program of the week's events is 
available at most shops, restaurants and banks in Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't get to the festival, here are a few recipes to make you think you 
are there. The recipes are from former issues of Palate Pleasers magazine 
(Apcon International Inc., Los Angeles), published semiannually, and have not 
been tested in The Times Test Kitchen.

LET'S EAT OUT: L'ENTRECOTE: THE REAL MCCOY FOR FRENCH STEAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you've never had entrecote, the Frenchman's idea of a great steak, you'll 
find the real McCoy at L'Entrecote on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills. And 
don't worry. The price is right: $14.50 fixed, because, friends, steak is all 
there is to order (except for one or two seafood or poultry specials daily). 
</P>
<P>
L'Entrecote is a one-dish specialty house that has chains in Geneva, London and 
Paris. Just look around and you'll notice customers who look as if they've 
dined at all the L'Entrecote chains and can't keep away. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, L'Entrecote was a nice surprise. I had expected a hit-and-run 
operation. But no, the meal is true prefection, scientifically honed to a fine 
line. There simply is no better entrecote, I would think, even in Paris. The 
steak is succulent, though not the juicy, thick type Americans adore. It's an 
eye of New York steak (long and about one-inch thick) that is served with a 
sauce, whose secret is locked in the family vault. There is a long-winded 
explanation of L'Entrecote's "famous" sauce that out-balances the size of the 
menu. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secret Sauce 
</P>
<P>
"In 1941," says the blurb, "the late Monsieur Freddy Dumont used a secret blend 
of 12 ingredients to create a savory sauce with a unique flavor. This sauce, 
which has gained world repute, is what graces our tables at L'Entrecote, 
Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Who is Dumont? We discover that Dumont had established the first Cafe de Paris 
in Geneva serving his special entrecote as the only item on the menu. That was 
20 years ago. Dumont's secret apparently was wrenched from him by offers he 
couldn't refuse because L'Entrecote now has exclusive rights to the sauce in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that Dumont had something. The bearnaise-type sauce makes 
the steak. The pomme-frites, which come with the steak also are excellent, and 
you can get seconds if you want. You also get a salad with the meal and what a 
great salad it is. Simple and to the point. A beautiful plate of soft butter 
lettuce is arranged like a huge blossom on the plate, and it too has a sauce 
that will make you want to return for more. The lettuce leaves are chilled, 
crisp and fresh, the vinaigrette divine. The salad comes to the table before, 
not after the steak, as is the French custom. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not all. The simple, understated, one-dish menu has a back page 
covered with the most enticing desserts you'll find anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
They are typical bistro desserts you'd find in brasseries and places like Le 
Drug Store (a drug store/restaurant chain) in Paris. There are wonderful 
sundaes topped with chantilly (whipped cream), doused in liqueurs, garnished 
with exotic, perfumed preserves, berries, chocolate, preserved orange and 
chestnuts, or nuts. We went wild over several sundaes including les meringues 
glacees (meringue topped with ice cream, chantilly and warm chocolate sauce, 
and la coupe exotique, made with pineapple, kiwis, and sorbet, and the 
chocolate, vanilla and strawberry cream with strawberries, roasted almonds and 
whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
The other desserts are also great. Try la tarte tatin (apple upside down cake), 
la creme caramel, la poire belle Helene (pears with ice cream and chocolate 
sauce), la peche Melba (peaches Melba) among others. We also tried a wonderful 
raspberry Bavarian they served as a special one day that was one of the best, 
if not the very best, I've ever had. This Bavarian was creamy, not too airy and 
delicious. 
</P>
<P>
If you go for lunch, you'll have more of a selection. One day there was salad 
Nicoise, grilled breast of chicken, pasta of the day, a French burger that is 
an interpretation of an American burger, served with (you guessed it) a sauce. 
There also were game hen and tiger prawns that were outstanding and fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch prices are moderate ($7.50 for the salad, chicken and burger, and $14.50 
for the fish and hen. The prawns go for $19.50, the highest price on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I think the steak is the best buy, bar none. You get it all. The 
salad, the steak, the French fries. They'll get you with the dessert at $4.50, 
but who can resist? 
</P>
<P>
A word about ambience: pleasant. Even romantic, if that's what you're looking 
for. In one room banquets line one wall (a la Francais), facing groupings of 
tables fitted nicely with immaculate table service. Another room faces the bar, 
which is at the entry and extremely accessible if you want to stop by for a 
quick one before heading home to the Valley or wherever, and pretend you're in 
Geneva, London or Paris. Same thing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L'Entrecote, 9025 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills; (213) 278-9998. Open Monday 
through Friday from noon to 11 p.m.; open Saturday and Sunday for dinner only 
from 6 p.m. to midnight. Major credit cards accepted. Valet parking available. 
Reservations suggested for dinner. Full bar.

EX-EDUCATION CHIEF BACKED AS JAPAN PRIME MINISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TOKYO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Toshiki Kaifu, a former education minister and an official of the smallest 
faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, emerged Wednesday as the likely 
successor to Prime Minister Sosuke Uno. 
</P>
<P>
With assurances of support from most of the party's five factions, Kaifu, 58, 
announced that he will be a candidate in Tuesday's election for party 
president. The winner will be elected prime minister by the lower house of 
Parliament, where the Liberal Democrats have a 39-seat majority. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu made his announcement after the leader of his faction, Toshio Komoto, a 
former deputy prime minister who twice before had sought the post of prime 
minister, withdrew his name. 
</P>
<P>
Komoto, seated beside Kaifu, said the 31 members of his faction have informed 
him that the party's representatives in Parliament favor a youthful leader to 
guide the beleaguered party through what promises to be a crucial, uphill 
battle in a forthcoming election for the lower house. Komoto is 78. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu also has the support of the 113-member faction controlled by former Prime 
Minister Noboru Takeshita and the 88-member faction of former Foreign Minister 
Shintaro Abe. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, he was assured, even before announcing his candidacy, of getting more 
than 50% of the votes to be cast in the party caucus. After Komoto's 
announcement, Kiichi Miyazawa, leader of the party's third-largest faction, 
which controls 19% of the caucus votes, added his endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said the overwhelming support for Kaifu gave him "a 99% 
guarantee" of victory. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates will submit their applications for the party presidency at a meeting 
Saturday, and the election is scheduled to take place at a party caucus 
Tuesday. Voting Tuesday will be the 405 Liberal Democratic members of both 
houses of Parliament and one party representative from each of Japan's 47 
prefectures -- a total of 452. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Formal Candidate 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Kaifu (pronounced Kigh-foo) made him the first formal 
candidate. Japanese newspapers reported that Shintaro Ishihara, a hawkish 
novelist-turned-politician, might also be a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu was a close associate of the late Prime Minister Takeo Miki, the "Mr. 
Clean" of Liberal Democratic politics in the years since World War II, and this 
has given him a corruption-free image. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Kaifu conceded Wednesday that he, like all the party's first-echelon 
leaders, had received political contributions from Recruit Co., the information 
and real estate conglomerate at the center of the scandal that brought down 
Takeshita and put Uno in his place. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the front-line leaders, all of whom the party disqualified from 
holding office, Kaifu said he had made no windfall profits from transactions in 
Recruit stock. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu said the company gave him 14.4 million yen ($105,726) between 1983 and 
1987 in contributions for political activities. He said the contributions were 
all reported to the authorities, as required by law, and amounted to "only a 
small portion" of the 200 million to 300 million yen ($1.5 million to $2.2 
million) he said he has received in total contributions in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time I received the (Recruit) contributions, that company was not known 
as a firm that was creating a social problem," Kaifu said. He said he has 
received no contributions from Recruit since its influence-buying activities 
were exposed last year. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu's emergence as the likely successor to Uno appeared to reflect the 
desperation of the Liberal Democrats. In May, after Takeshita assumed 
responsibility for the Recruit scandal and announced his resignation, he said 
no consideration would be given to any of the party's "youth corps" as prime 
minister. Instead, he designated as his successor Uno, 66, whose 1985 affair 
with a geisha was exposed three days after Uno took office June 2. 
</P>
<P>
Voter disenchantment with the Liberal Democrats -- rooted in the Recruit 
scandal as well as a broken promise not to enact a consumption tax -- led to a 
setback in the July 23 election for the upper house of Parliament. The Liberal 
Democrats fell 17 seats short of a majority, the first time since the party was 
formed 34 years ago that it had lost control of either house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
As the votes were being counted, Uno announced his intention to resign as prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fresh Face Needed 
</P>
<P>
A surge of popularity for Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Socialist Party, 
increased the number of Socialist seats in the upper house by 63% and made it 
imperative that the Liberal Democrats choose a leader with a fresh appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu's good looks and his ability as an orator -- he won a national debating 
contest as a student at Waseda University -- were cited as reasons for choosing 
him to deal with the "Doi boom." 
</P>
<P>
Elections for the powerful lower house of Parliament must take place by next 
July but are expected to be called as early as this fall, and the Liberal 
Democrats face a make-or-break situation. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats' setback in the upper house meant that they can no longer 
enact legislation unilaterally; a loss in the lower house could deprive them of 
the power to elect their leader unilaterally as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Crisis for the Party' 
</P>
<P>
In recommending Kaifu, Komoto said the upper house defeat constituted "a crisis 
for the party and a crisis for Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu pledged to make political reform his No. 1 priority. He pointed to his 
faction's record of advocating political ethics and his own work with a ruling 
party reform committee. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said he would be willing to revise the unpopular consumption 
tax, which analysts cited as the main cause for the Liberal Democrats' setback 
in the upper house. But he asked for more time "to organize my thinking" on the 
matter.

terrorism, the United States has asked the Kremlin for its help in determining 
the status of American and other Western hostages held by militant Muslims in 
Lebanon, informed sources said here Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The request, which follows the reported killing of an American hostage Monday 
and a threat to kill another one today, was made at a hastily called meeting 
Wednesday between Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and U.S. 
Ambassador Jack F. Matlock, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported the meeting in a three-line 
announcement Wednesday afternoon. A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy, confirming 
that the meeting had taken place, said it had come at Matlock's request, lasted 
for "less than an hour" and was intended "to convey the deep concern of the 
U.S. government regarding the hostages being held in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
Neither side provided any further details, but an informed source said Matlock 
had sought Soviet assistance "in the new spirit of 011cooperation the two 
countries have declared in the battle against terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Another source termed the contact useful but refused to provide any details of 
the Soviet response. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place only hours after Shevardnadze returned from what Tass 
termed "a brief working visit to Tehran," where he met with the new Iranian 
president, Hashemi Rafsanjani. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said: "Shevardnadze touched on the exacerbation of the situation in 
Lebanon . . . in connection with the abduction of Sheik (Abdel Karim) Obeid, a 
Shiite leader, and the execution of U.S. citizen William Higgins, who was taken 
hostage." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli commandos seized Obeid, a Muslim clergyman and leading pro-Iranian 
militant, in a raid into southern Lebanon last Friday, reportedly hoping to 
exchange him for three Israeli servicemen held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
A Shiite group known as the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth demanded 
that Obeid be freed by Monday, but the Israelis refused. On Monday, the group 
12announced that it had hanged Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, 44, the Marine 
Corps officer seized in February, 1988, while serving as a United Nations truce 
observer in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances of Higgins' reported death have not been confirmed. A special 
U.N. envoy, Marrack Goulding, arrived in Beirut on Wednesday to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Another pro-Iranian Shiite group, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, has 
said it will kill another American hostage, Joseph J. Cicippio, 58, if Obeid is 
not released by 6 p.m. today (8 a.m. PDT). Cicippio was acting controller of 
the American University of Beirut when he was abducted on the campus there 
Sept. 12, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Tass account of Shevardnadze's visit to Tehran, President 
Rafsanjani "voiced deep regret over what has happened and confirmed that Iran 
does not have relation to the tragedy which broke out in Lebanon." It said the 
two sides "denounced any actions of the terrorist nature and favored the 
adoption of urgent measures to prevent a further sharpening of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth is a faction of the Hezbollah, or 
Party of God, organization, which is believed to be the umbrella group uniting 
terrorist cells that hold most of the 14 Western hostages in the country, among 
them eight Americans. The Revolutionary Justice Organization is also believed 
to be a faction of Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage situation was discussed last January by U.S. and Soviet civilian 
experts at an unprecedented bilateral symposium on the subject. The four-day 
meeting produced a joint communique urging the U.S. and Soviet governments to 
create a formal means of cooperating in the fight against terrorism. Contacts 
were institutionalized last May when the subject was placed on the agenda for 
talks in Moscow by Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In June, government anti-terrorism experts from the two countries reportedly 
had an unannounced meeting here to explore the possibilities for joint action 
and an exchange of information. 
</P>
<P>
According to published accounts that appeared several days later, the U.S. 
delegation to the latest meeting was headed by Morris Busby, the State 
Department coordinator for counterterrorism. His Soviet counterpart was Yuri 
Ryabakov, chief of the Foreign Ministry's legal affairs department. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the superpowers on such a delicate and traditionally secret 
subject as combatting terrorism faces a number of possible hurdles, starting 
with disagreement over who is a terrorist and who is a "freedom fighter." 
</P>
<P>
Relations between the Soviet Union and Iran have been improving recently, and, 
in addition, the Soviet Union counts Syria among its allies in the region. 
Syria is considered another key player in the Lebanese situation.

COLISEUM TOLD THAT IT'S IN BIDDING WAR FOR RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Coliseum Commission gave its private managers the go-ahead 
Wednesday to negotiate a deal that would keep the Los Angeles Raiders in the 
Coliseum in exchange for approximately a $125-million reconstruction of the 
facility and a $30-million cash payment to the team. 
</P>
<P>
The commission acted in closed session after being told, according to sources 
who attended the meeting, that they are now in a bidding war for the Raiders 
with Oakland, Sacramento and perhaps Irwindale and that team owner Al Davis is 
being offered such big cash inducements by the other bidders. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to the sources, Irving Azoff, chairman of MCA Inc.'s Music 
Entertainment Group and a key member of the Coliseum's private management team, 
assured the commission that only private money would be used to pay the Raiders 
and that private financing also would be used for most of the Coliseum 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
Azoff said that if the deal is closed the commission would be asked to 
authorize a long-term lease of the facility to the private developers, allowing 
them to go ahead and make all arrangements. He said this would facilitate the 
deal and that Davis had suggested he broach the concept to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Azoff told newsmen that although the odds may be against keeping the team in 
Los Angeles, he is sure, based on a long friendship with Davis, that the 
Raiders owner would not be stringing him along and that he is seriously 
negotiating with Los Angeles as well as Oakland and the other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, after a long closed-door session during which Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Pete Schabarum reportedly voiced many reservations, finally 
issued a brief statement: 
</P>
<P>
". . . the commission took action approving, in concept, the approach of our 
managers relative to the present negotiations with the Raiders regarding 
resolution of the commission's ($57-million breach-of-contract) lawsuit against 
the Raiders, including the possibility of a long-term subleasing of the 
facilities to a private party or parties." 
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to say that this would be "in exchange for a long-term 
commitment of the Raiders to play in a substantially renovated Coliseum, which 
preserves the historical peristyle of the facility." 
</P>
<P>
"The commission authorized and instructed the managers to continue settlement 
discussions with the Raiders on this concept, with the understanding that the 
discussions, at this time, are conceptual only and the commission retains the 
power and the authority to approve any and all settlement agreements." 
</P>
<P>
Azoff said the statement was approved also by Marshall Grossman, the 
commission's attorney in its 2-year-old suit against the Raiders. The suit was 
filed after the Raiders announced plans to move to suburban Irwindale, possibly 
before the first term of their lease to play in the Coliseum expired at the end 
of the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Azoff and Commission President Richard Riordan had said there would 
be a public discussion of the status of the negotiations with the Raiders, but, 
except for very brief comments in the meeting by Schabarum and Riordan, 
everything that was said Wednesday was in closed session. 
</P>
<P>
Azoff explained outside that if the deal was going to be privately financed, he 
saw no need for public disclosure of its details and that the final details 
might never be publicly disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
But the MCA executive added at one point that the Coliseum Commission might be 
asked to contribute something to the financing of the reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
When it was suggested that it would be hard to keep the deal secret if public 
money was involved, Azoff responded that he might rather do without a 
commission contribution if it meant terms of the deal would have to be made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders had no immediate comment on Wednesday's commission action. They 
have steadfastly refused comment on all reports of negotiations with any of the 
cities bidding for the team. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the Coliseum Commission acted to fortify the Los Angeles bid to keep 
the Raiders, there were these developments in other bidding cities: 
</P>
<P>
* A spokesman for Irwindale, Xavier Hermosillo, said the San Gabriel Valley 
city has at last made a financing proposal to Davis for building the stadium in 
Irwindale. He said it would entail a $125-million loan to build the stadium, 
plus $30.5 million in various cash payments to the team (including $10 million 
already paid to the team), and a $50-million municipal commitment to buy land 
for the stadium, prepare the site and provide parking. Hermosillo would not 
divulge the names of private investors that he said had agreed to fund the 
deal, nor would he discuss how much Irwindale would invest in the deal. He said 
the city is awaiting a reply from Davis on its latest proposal. 
</P>
<P>
* In Oakland, City Manager Henry Gardner said that Raider representatives met 
for seven hours with Oakland and Alameda County officials Tuesday in a private 
law office to discuss terms of a possible Raider return to the East Bay city. 
Gardner, who was briefed on the meeting but did not attend it, described it as 
"quite productive," but said there had been "no outcome." 
</P>
<P>
Azoff has said that in meetings with Davis, the Raiders owner has been very 
frank that he is listening to all offers, and has set no deadlines, and will 
take the offer he considers best. 
</P>
<P>
He added that his feeling is that a Davis decision on the future playing site 
of the team is "imminent." 
</P>
<P>
"It's third down and long for us, very long," Azoff said. "But we're not in a 
punting situation yet. It's not hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
Describing a reconstructed Coliseum in broad terms, Azoff said it might become 
a two-tier facility with 150 luxury boxes, and a flexible capacity that might 
be 60,000 to 75,000 to Raider football, 85,000 for USC football and 22,000 for 
concerts. There would be improved sight lines and easier access in and out, he 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Of the present Coliseum, Azoff suggested, only the east-end peristyle would be 
left. 
</P>
<P>
He said that during the reconstruction the Coliseum would be closed for 
football play for a year and the Raiders and USC would have to play their games 
that year elsewhere, perhaps in the Rose Bowl or Dodger Stadium.

PRAISES SUNG FOR MONEY TO KEEP TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents and students have staged a sing-a-thon at a pizza parlor, persuaded a 
yogurt shop to pitch in part of its profits and solicited donations outside 
supermarkets in an effort to keep Ted Reid teaching at Fountain Valley High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Reid, 34, widely praised for his ability to inspire students to excel and 
embrace the love of music, has taught at the Orange County school for the last 
three years but was among 32 teachers who were told that they would not be 
rehired for the fall semester. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers are the victims of declining enrollment in the Huntington Beach 
Union High School District, where rising housing prices have kept out many 
younger families with children. The district will have 2,200 fewer students in 
its six high schools this fall than two years ago, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But parents, who rave about Reid's program and how it has turned their children 
on to music and the arts, have vowed to raise enough money to retain him as the 
music teacher and director of the school's three choirs. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of teacher who can pass on his enthusiasm and knowledge of music is 
rare," said Pat Harney, whose three children have studied under Reid. "But Ted 
Reid is really good at that. He turns the kids on to music." 
</P>
<P>
While parent groups in Huntington Beach and other districts have raised money 
to supplement teacher salaries or augment special programs, directors of 
education groups say it is rare for a group to take on the task of raising 
money to save one teacher's job. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the group formed to keep Reid on the payroll -- the Vocal Music 
Foundation, with about 100 parent members -- was prepared to raise $43,000 to 
pay Reid's full-time salary for teaching three periods of music and two English 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
But after hearing of the parents' determination and of the difficulties the 
group was having in raising the money, the district said it would require only 
$28,000, or enough to pay Reid for the three periods of music. The district 
said it needs $12,000 by Aug. 15, with the rest due later. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to other fund-raising activities, the group also appealed to real 
estate agencies in the Huntington Beach area for help, saying that if a school 
does not have a good music program, home sales could drop. 
</P>
<P>
All this attention, frankly, makes Reid a little uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gratifying and a little bit flattering," he said. "It's also a little bit 
uncomfortable to have people spending so much of their free time and free 
energy on your behalf. But I know ultimately that it's on behalf of their 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Parents say special programs such as Reid's choirs make the school a special 
place for students. But they say that in these times of scarce school funds, 
such programs are fast becoming luxuries that parents are having to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
"Fountain Valley doesn't have any music in its elementary schools anymore," 
said Susan Pike, the mother of two students in the music program. "I feel like 
a lot of people don't realize what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Einstein, a former Reid student who will become a music major at Ithaca 
College in New York this fall, praised Reid for his commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot speak highly enough about this program," she said. "The best part of 
my high school experience was the choir." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the school's three choirs puts on several performances a year, and the 
groups also appear in out-of-town concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes hours and hours of rehearsal and planning the tours and planning 
different performances," Einstein said. "Mr. Reid happens to be the type of 
teacher who puts his entire person into it." 
</P>
<P>
Reid, in turn, said the music program at Fountain Valley has been successful 
because of parent support. 
</P>
<P>
"Their support is indicative of the quality of students we have," Reid said. 
"The support we get from parents makes it possible for us to reach higher and 
higher and higher goals." 
</P>
<P>
Married and the father of a 2-month-old child, Reid said the uncertainty over 
his future had been "a point of tremendous concern for my wife and me." 
</P>
<P>
Because he did not know his status with the Huntington Beach district, he has 
found two other part-time jobs: one directing a 100-voice adult choir called 
the Masterworks Chorale at Orange Coast College and one as music director of a 
Huntington Beach church. 
</P>
<P>
The district was not going to do away with the music program entirely at 
Fountain Valley High. But administrators were going to ask a music teacher at 
another school to take on the programs at both schools. 
</P>
<P>
"That is comparable to asking a football coach to take over at two schools," 
Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's doable, but both programs are going to suffer," he said.

Stone columns and balconies over an entrance to Kiev's main post office 
collapsed on Wednesday, crushing rush-hour pedestrians in a 15-foot heap of 
rubble, Soviet television said. The report gave no casualty figure. 
</P>
<P>
The evening news program "Vremya" said the victims were buried in a pile of 
brown stone on Kiev's main street, Kreshatik, at about 4:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time, there were particularly many people here. Visitors to the post 
office, passers-by and people hurrying to the nearby subway station were 
trapped under the rubble," the TV report said. 
</P>
<P>
The news program said rescue work had been completed by Wednesday evening but 
did not give a casualty figure. 
</P>
<P>
Valery Chasny, a resident of Kiev, said in a telephone interview that at least 
two people were pulled alive from the wreckage. Chasny said firefighters, 
paratroopers and at least 10 ambulances rushed to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The city, about 500 miles southwest of Moscow, is the capital of the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
The newscast showed tape of soldiers and residents pulling pieces of wreckage 
off the pile in the search for survivors. One battered survivor was shown being 
carried away on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
The TV pictures showed that the collapse occurred from the top, or 7th floor of 
the building, as two broad columns leading up the front of the post office and 
the balconies between them all crashed to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The building remained standing. 
</P>
<P>
The post office, constructed in the 1950s, had been under repair. The newscast 
said a construction crew had boarded up the entrance with wood but then delayed 
repair work. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain at the time of the collapse apparently loosened the facade, the news 
report said. But it added that a commission had been formed to look into the 
cause of the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Chasny said a woman was hit by something that fell from the building last 
winter, but that reconstruction work did not begin until about a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately possible to gain more details of the collapse. Calls to 
news organizations in Kiev were not answered.

POLISH COMMUNISTS REGAIN ALLIES, NAME PREMIER

Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, Poland's interior minister, was elected premier 
Wednesday as the Communist Party whipped its recalcitrant coalition partners 
into line to get the needed votes in the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 237 to 173, with 10 abstentions, indicating that most of the 76 
members of the United Peasants' Party, which on Tuesday had threatened to bolt 
the Communist coalition, voted for Kiszczak. 
</P>
<P>
A career military officer and interior minister since 1981, Kiszczak, 62, 
headed the government delegation in the so-called round-table negotiations with 
Solidarity, the independent trade union movement, that led to the recent 
elections. He has been one of President Wojciech Jaruzelski's chief allies in 
Jaruzelski's reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Invitation to Solidarity 
</P>
<P>
After his election Wednesday, Kiszczak (full name pronounced CHESS-wahff 
KEESH-chahk) repeated his invitation for Solidarity to join the government, 
noting "with regret" that Solidarity already had refused similar appeals from 
the Communist leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Kiszczak said he "will not give up efforts to attract . . . representatives of 
the opposition circles, with hope that in the future a grand coalition 
government will be possible." He asked for two weeks to assemble a government. 
</P>
<P>
The turnaround by the Peasants' Party deputies in the Sejm, the Assembly's 
lower house, was a disappointment to some Solidarity firebrands who had 
envisioned a possible Solidarity-led government if the Communist allies had 
gone ahead with their defection. 
</P>
<P>
But the relaxed attitude of most of Solidarity's senior leadership suggested a 
sense of relief at having avoided what would have been a political crisis if 
the Communists had been forced to deal with the Soviet Bloc's first 
non-Communist, opposition-led government. 
</P>
<P>
The Peasants' Party deputies apparently were brought around after a tense, 
closed-door meeting with the Communist parliamentary leadership Tuesday night. 
Communist Party leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski joined the session after a trip 
to the hospital earlier in the day. Aides said he had had a spell of dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear what form of persuasion Rakowski and other Communist leaders 
might have used at the meeting, but some sources suggested that the Peasants' 
Party share of the nomenklatura -- essentially patronage positions -- and other 
material privileges of the alliance figured prominently in the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
As a final threat, the Communists could have pointed out that Jaruzelski is 
empowered by the constitution to dissolve Parliament and call for new elections 
in the event of a deadlock over the choice of a government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeared 'Frightened' 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like they were frightened," said Jan Litynski, a Solidarity deputy 
who had said Tuesday, in the middle of the Peasants' Party revolt, that the way 
had been cleared for the formation of a Solidarity government. 
</P>
<P>
But the problems a Solidarity government would have had to face are now dropped 
in Kiszczak's lap. Thus, Solidarity -- which according to its moderate leaders 
is not prepared to run a government -- will be able to observe the Communist 
government's workings at close range and prepare for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Most Solidarity activists, as well as many diplomatic observers, believe that 
the Kiszczak government will be an interim affair. 
</P>
<P>
The new premier's first and most urgent task is to do something about the 
economy. Food stores in Poland's cities have been picked virtually clean, and 
many have closed as the government has frozen price supports for food. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the government's new "marketization" plan went into effect and meat 
prices rose by as much as 288%. Prices of such staples as flour, sugar and salt 
were up by about 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Before choosing Kiszczak as premier, the National Assembly decided, by a vote 
of 206 to 169, to form a commission to investigate the previous government's 
handling of the economy. That government, headed by Rakowski, now the Communist 
Party leader, has been criticized for allowing inflation to accelerate to the 
triple-digit level. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the Assembly, Kiszczak asked the lawmakers to appoint a team 
of experts, with representatives from "all political groupings," to help design 
an economic program with special emphasis on curbing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a set of immediate steps for the coming months to halt the concrete 
danger of total economic and, consequently, even political destabilization," 
Kiszczak said. 
</P>
<P>
He said drastic measures will be required to ensure market supplies, 
particularly supplies of food. These measures, he said, likely would include 
curbs on state investment and reduced exports of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
"It is possible," he said, "to make considerable budget savings . . . in the 
Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry for Internal Affairs."

EX-DICTATOR BACKS LEFTIST FOR BOLIVIA PRESIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic socialist Jaime Paz Zamora and former military dictator Hugo Banzer 
on Wednesday announced a surprising agreement of the left and the right that is 
expected to give Paz Zamora the Bolivian presidency this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement appeared to end protracted negotiations by political parties in 
preparation for a presidential run-off vote in Congress on Friday or Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Banzer told reporters he was giving up his presidential bid and throwing his 
Nationalist Democratic Action party's decisive support to Paz Zamora "so that 
the people will not continue to be punished by uncertainty and instability." 
Many analysts had feared a stalemate in the electoral process that would leave 
this nation of seven million people without a president ready for Sunday's 
scheduled inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Banzer's and Paz Zamora's parties will form a coalition 
government, and Banzer will share power as chairman of a new Political Council 
of National Convergence and Unity. 
</P>
<P>
Banzer spurned an agreement with presidential candidate Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada, a member of the centrist party currently in power. Sanchez de Lozada 
had crossed Banzer before this year's presidential campaign by breaking a 1985 
coalition agreement between their two parties. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez de Lozada was the front-runner in a May 7 popular election with 23% of 
the vote. Banzer finished second with 22.7% and Paz Zamora had 19.6%. 
</P>
<P>
About 10% of the votes were blank or invalid, and six other candidates shared 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The new Congress -- elected at the same time -- is to choose a president from 
the three top finishers. Because of the make-up of the Congress, none of the 
three finalists can win without support from one of the others. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations made little progress until this week because each party wanted its 
own candidate as president. Paz Zamora, 50, told reporters Wednesday that 
Banzer, 63, "spontaneously" offered to withdraw his candidacy in a late 
negotiating session the night before. 
</P>
<P>
From 1971 to 1978, when Banzer was a conservative military president and Paz 
Zamora's Leftist Revolutionary Movement was a radical underground group, the 
two were bitter enemies. Since then, Paz Zamora's movement has become a 
moderate leftist party affiliated with European and Latin American social 
democrats. He was vice president in the center-left administration of 
then-President Hernan Siles Zuazo from 1982-1985. 
</P>
<P>
That administration ended in economic chaos, with inflation raging at an annual 
rate of more than 20,000%. 
</P>
<P>
President Victor Paz Estenssoro, who took office in 1985, imposed a tough 
austerity policy that has brought inflation down to 2.4% in the first seven 
months of this year.

HOUSE REJECTS DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BAN ON USE OF ALL PUBLIC FUNDS FOR ABORTIONS

<P>
In a dramatic and unexpected victory for pro-choice forces, the House Wednesday 
narrowly defeated an amendment that would ban the use of all public funds for 
abortions in the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The 219-206 vote against an amendment by Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) 
marked the first time the House had come down on the side of abortion rights in 
five years. Pro-choice leaders hailed it as an indication of growing national 
support for abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, which came during debate on a $532-million appropriation bill for the 
District of Columbia, drew strong criticism from President Bush, who said he 
would veto the legislation if it did not eventually contain the Dornan 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Funds Use Banned 
</P>
<P>
Even without the Dornan amendment, the House bill would ban the use of federal 
funds for abortions in the District of Columbia. The Dornan amendment would 
have banned the use of local funds as well. 
</P>
<P>
The House is expected to pass the entire bill today and send it to the Senate, 
where the fate of the abortion provision is unclear. Supporters of the Dornan 
amendment vowed to make one last attempt just before final passage to restore 
the sweeping abortion ban. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's House vote on the Dornan amendment exhilarated pro-choice forces. 
"This is the first indication of the changing political winds in Congress and 
in this country in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in the Webster case," 
said an exuberant Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund. 
"We've sent a strong message to the other side that the tide is beginning to 
turn." 
</P>
<P>
In last month's ruling in the case of Webster vs. Missouri, the Supreme Court 
gave the states wide latitude to regulate abortion. 
</P>
<P>
A measure similar to the Dornan amendment became law last year after receiving 
a 222-186 favorable vote in the House. However, Rep. Les AuCoin (D-Ore.) said 
that the recent Supreme Court decision "turned up the heat" on the issue and 
made it more difficult for many members of Congress to oppose abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue is no longer the comfortable political turkey shoot that it used to 
be," he said. "This vote should let the other side know that it's trouble, and 
it's going to be more trouble for them in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after the vote, Dornan conceded that the decision by some Republicans 
to oppose his amendment "came as a shock" to him. He agreed that "something has 
happened" on the Democratic side to erode the strength of pro-life forces in 
the House since last year's vote. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, he and other pro-life advocates dismissed 
Wednesday's action as an aberration and expressed confidence that they would 
prevail. They said there would be more than enough votes to sustain a Bush 
veto, and also suggested that many House members were "confused" by the issue 
and might vote differently if a similar amendment came up again. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, they said, pro-life members of Congress were concerned that 
Dornan's amendment banned the use of public funds for abortions even if a 
woman's life was in danger or if she had been the victim of rape or incest. 
Sponsors had pledged that they would restore such exemptions when the issue 
came before a joint House-Senate conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Congress enacted a ban on the use of all public funds -- federal and 
local -- for abortions in the District of Columbia. In the previous four years, 
Congress had mandated only that federal funds not be used for district 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Democratic-controlled House Appropriations Committee voted to 
ban only the use of federal funds. When Dornan introduced his amendment, he 
sparked an acrimonious 40-minute debate that revealed the bitter divisions in 
Congress over the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's anything worse in this country than for women to watch 
men in blue suits debate this issue," said Rep. Louise M. Slaughter (D-N.Y.). 
"This issue discriminates against the women of the District of Columbia, and we 
owe the women of America more than that." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan leaped to his feet in response, saying: "I apologize that I'm in a blue 
suit. Many of the abortionist doctors wear white," but their uniforms are 
"bloodstained." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), who helped lead the floor fight against 
Dornan's proposal, turned to pro-life members and said angrily: "You really 
don't know what you're talking about. You couldn't know. We shouldn't even be 
discussing this issue. You don't know what it is to bear a child or not. You 
don't know how tormenting that decision can be." 
</P>
<P>
Others charged that Dornan's amendment would jeopardize the District of 
Columbia's right to home rule and deprive local taxpayers of the power to make 
decisions about the use of their own revenues. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Alan B. Mollohan (D-W.Va.) said that Congress controls the district's 
purse strings. "I have a hard time believing that you would view home rule as a 
more important issue than abortion," he added.

The National Endowment for the Humanities on Wednesday granted $15 million to 
preserve old and rare books, newspapers and other resources that are in danger 
of decaying. 
</P>
<P>
The grants, ranging from $2,800 to $2.5 million, have been awarded to 25 
institutions in 14 states, including the New England Ivy League schools 
Harvard, Dartmouth, Yale and Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The money will help libraries to preserve on microfilm books as well as 
photographs, monographs and videotapes used in scholarly research that would 
otherwise disintegrate from acid residues and be lost to future generations. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard will receive $1.8 million, which it will use to microfilm more than 
27,000 volumes on American and Italian history it began collecting when the 
library opened in the 17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The university also will use the funds to microfilm its volumes on pre-Soviet 
Russian law, much of which is no longer available in the Soviet Union, said 
Sidney Verba, director of the university library. 
</P>
<P>
"Our books about pre-Soviet Russian law are consulted by people from all over 
the world, including Russia," he said. "We have many visiting scholars from 
Eastern Europe because these books are either not available or not accessible 
in their own countries." 
</P>
<P>
Dartmouth College, in Hanover, N.H., will receive $409,000, which it plans to 
use to microfilm some 650,000 pages of state newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Yale, in New Haven, Conn., was selected to receive $215,000 for the 
preservation of some 4,000 volumes from its European history collection. 
</P>
<P>
Endowment Chairman Lynne Cheney said the grants are the largest ever allocated 
for preservation projects and will help save some 167,300 volumes nationwide.

TRIDENT 2 LAUNCHED FROM SUB AS SOVIET SPIES WATCH

The crew of a nuclear submarine launched the Navy's new Trident 2 missile on 
its first successful underwater test Wednesday, and the captain of a nearby 
Soviet spy ship radioed greetings. 
</P>
<P>
"My best regards to the skipper of the sub," the Soviet captain said. For 
years, Soviet spy ships have observed most launchings from Cape Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
The salute came after the 44-foot missile was launched by the submarine 
Tennessee, burst to the surface, ignited and propelled a dummy warhead to a 
target far down the Atlantic tracking range. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace U.S.A. activists who oppose nuclear weapons at sea halted the test 
last Friday by sailing ships into the launch security zone, but stayed away 
Wednesday, saying they had made their point. 
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. Arlington Campbell, commander of Submarine Group 6, told reporters: 
"As far as we can tell from our telemetry, it was a totally nominal launch. 
From all indications, everything has been successful." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy did not disclose how far the warhead section traveled. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the $23.7-million missiles is designed to propel as many as 12 nuclear 
warheads to different targets more than 4,600 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The results were in sharp contrast to the Trident 2's first submarine launch on 
March 21, when the missile cartwheeled out of control and exploded four seconds 
after it was launched from the Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that failure was caused by a faulty mechanical linkage 
responsible for moving the rocket motor nozzles back and forth to control 
direction. The system was redesigned.

A space shuttle will be lost and astronauts may well die within the next decade 
if the United States carries out its vision of exploring the universe, Congress 
was warned in a report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"If the United States wishes to send people into space on a routine basis, the 
nation will have to accept the risks these activities entail," said the study 
by the congressional Office of Technology Assessment. "If such risks are 
perceived to be too high, the nation may decide to reduce its emphasis on 
placing humans in space." 
</P>
<P>
The price of increased space activity includes "the likelihood that loss of 
life will occur," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The OTA report, called "Round Trip to Orbit: Human Space Flight Alternatives," 
examines some of the policy choices Congress faces in decisions for this 
century and the next. The OTA said NASA could reduce some of the risks by 
building a fifth orbiter, at a cost of $2.5 billion, including spare parts.

An F-14 Tomcat fighter based at Miramar Naval Air Station plunged into the sea 
off Point Loma on Wednesday, but both crewmen ejected safely and were rescued, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth crash of a Miramar-based F-14 since December, and the 102nd 
since the fighter was introduced into service in 1972. Just last week, a 
Miramar-based F-14 crashed near San Clemente Island. Both crewmen ejected 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
Navy spokesman Cmdr. Doug Schamp said it did not appear that there was any 
connection between the two crashes, both of which are under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's crash occurred about 6 p.m., Schamp said, after the aircraft 
developed problems while on a routine exercise from the carrier Carl Vinson. 
The pilot was attempting an emergency landing at North Island Naval Air 
Station, Schamp said, when the decision was made to eject.

KOREANS END SYMPATHY HUNGER STRIKE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of 25 people protesting the actions of the South Korean government 
ended a four-day hunger strike Wednesday at a South-Central Los Angeles church. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, who ranged from students and businessmen to ministers and a 
12-year-old girl, began their fast Sunday to coincide with a hunger strike 
begun a day earlier by a young South Korean woman. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, a 20-year-old college student named Im Suk Yong, was denied 
permission to return to her country after visiting North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Her local supporters held their protest at the Good Samaritan United 
Presbyterian Church on Adams Boulevard. The demonstration was one of five 
hunger strikes held by Korean Americans in various cities. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's fast in North Korea drew attention in Los Angeles -- which is home 
to more than 200,000 Korean immigrants -- to the emotionally charged issue of 
the reunification of communist North Korea and its capitalist neighbor to the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
"To Koreans, the matter of reunification is the number one concern," said Noh 
Kil-nam, president of the Los Angeles-based Korea Study Council, a sponsor of 
the hunger strike. "It's a very hot issue with not only Koreans in Korea, but 
Korean residents in Japan, the U.S. and in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
The original fast overseas began after the South Korean government issued a 
directive prohibiting Im from crossing the demilitarized zone that divides 
North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
She had attended a banned youth festival last month in the North Korean capital 
of Pyongyang. As a symbol of openness between the two Koreas, Im intended to 
return home by walking through Panmunjom, the village separating the north and 
south, but she was stopped by security forces. 
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government, claiming that she had violated its national 
security laws by the visiting the north, would not allow her to pass through 
the zone. 
</P>
<P>
In protest, Im last week launched a fast and her cause was soon taken up by 
Koreans in various countries. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman, however, called off her fast Wednesday, stating that she had 
"won a great victory" and that she would continue to struggle for reunification 
and her return to the south. 
</P>
<P>
"Support for reunification is widespread," said Yuk Dae Sung, a Los Angeles 
student who took part in the hunger strike here. Yuk told a press conference 
that he met Im at the North Korean youth festival last month, and he held up 
photographs showing Im surrounded by a large group of students. 
</P>
<P>
Yuk said Koreans do not dispute that reunification is their primary issue. "How 
to achieve it is the important matter," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A local Korean minister agreed that the reunification issue is of prime 
importance to his community, but disputed the methods of Im and other student 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows what is reality, or what is propaganda, when governments talk," 
said Mark Song Matsumura. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost 99% of Korean immigrants feel Im Suk Yong is wrong," he said. "Korean 
Americans say she is part of a farfetched student outcry for immediate 
reunification. They think she has been pushed into it."

JOHN HIRSCH; NOTED STAGE DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Hirsch, the Hungarian-born stage director who lost his entire family in 
the Holocaust and later said that nightmare became the political passion that 
drove his work, died Tuesday at a hospital in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
He was 59 and a spokeswoman for the Canadian Stage Company said he died of 
complications of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch, who was one of only three survivors of 800 Jews in the small Hungarian 
town of Siofok during World War II, emerged in 1947 from a painful odyssey that 
had taken him through the internment camps of Europe to Canada. His parents had 
been prominent in the theater in Hungary where he staged his first play in the 
back yard when he was 6, and he carried that heritage to his new home in 
Canada, where he was adopted by a family of Russian Jews. 
</P>
<P>
There he worked, graduated from the University of Manitoba and began an 
involvement with the theater that resulted in his founding two of them in 
Winnipeg. His career culminated in his appointment in 1981 as artistic director 
of the Stratford Festival which had begun in 1953 with Alec Guinness as 
"Richard III" and which today draws more than 150,000 during its summer season. 
He had been associate director from 1967 to 1969. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Colorful Career 
</P>
<P>
Before, during and after that 1981-86 affiliation, Hirsch was director of more 
than 200 productions at the Seattle Repertory Theatre, New York's Lincoln 
Center Repertory Company (where he won an Outer Critics' Circle Award in 1968 
for "St. Joan") and founding artistic director of the Manitoba (Canada) Theatre 
Center. He also was the entrepreneur who brought productions to The Guthrie 
Theater in Minneapolis, the Mark Taper Forum (L.A. Drama Critics' Circle Award 
for "The Dybbuk" in 1975), New York City Opera Company and many more. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Davidson, artistic director of Los Angeles' Mark Taper Forum, the scene 
of many of Hirsch's triumphs, said after learning of his death that "John 
Hirsch lit candles in the theater, he illuminated the stage with passion; he 
believed the theater could communicate values and he exemplified that in his 
work." 
</P>
<P>
On Broadway Hirsch directed "We Bombed in New Haven," which starred Jason 
Robards. Off-Broadway he received an Obie Award in 1970 as best director for 
"AC-DC." 
</P>
<P>
He also staged a production of Chekhov's "The Seagull" in Hebrew for the 
Habimah Theatre in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comparison to North 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, he was a writer, translator and lecturer at such universities as 
Yale, New York, Columbia and Southern Methodist and head of television drama at 
the Canadian Broadcasting Co. from 1974 to 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently he directed "Coriolanus" at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego 
into which he wove Oliver North and Irangate. He likened Shakespeare's 
Coriolanus to North in that both were military patriots prepared to fight for 
whatever they felt right for their country. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch, who was awarded the Order of Canada in 1967, was noted throughout his 
career for contemporary choices of atmosphere in his productions. 
</P>
<P>
"The classics are like litmus tests," he said in an interview last year shortly 
before his health failed. 
</P>
<P>
"You dip them into the fluid of the time to see what happens. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch is survived by his adoptive mother, a cousin and his longtime companion, 
Brian Trottier. Services will be held today in Toronto.

The new program to provide condoms for inmates at San Francisco County Jail has 
produced a lot of controversy but -- so far -- no takers. "Anything that is new 
is viewed with suspicion and distrust," said Sheriff Mike Hennessey. "I think 
they are taking a wait-and-see attitude." Critics of the program contend that 
the AIDS counselors who are providing the condoms could be aiding or abetting 
sex between inmates, which is a felony. Advocates say the condoms will help 
prevent the spread of the fatal disease.

Mediators from the Organization of American States have launched a fourth round 
of talks in Panama City with Panamanian opposition and government leaders to 
try to end a political crisis before a constitutional deadline expires in a 
month. The OAS team met separately with opposition leaders and a representative 
of strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. Panama has been rocked by a political 
crisis since the May 7 presidential elections were annulled by Panama's 
Electoral Tribunal after widespread allegations of fraud. Under Panama's 
constitution, the election process provides for a transfer of power by Sept. 1.

CHINESE WON'T SEEK ASYLUM

Eight members of a Chinese opera company who disappeared in San Francisco last 
week just days before they were scheduled to return home will not seek 
political asylum in the United States, Alan Chow, executive director of the 
Chinese American Arts Council in New York City, said. He said the performers 
from the Shanghai Kun Opera had not realized the implications of their actions 
and were frightened by newspaper publicity. "They don't realize what they did," 
said Chow, adding that he was angry the entertainers had not contacted him 
before they acted. "If they wanted to stay in the U.S. they should have gone 
the legal way." Chow, who has had no direct contact with the eight since they 
left New York, said he heard from friends that the group probably would not 
apply for asylum. Chow said he believes the performers are hiding with friends, 
four in San Francisco, two in New York City and two in Washington. immigration 
and FBI officials reported no contact with the group.

BILL INTRODUCED TO RESTORE NORTH PENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House Armed Services Committee's top Republican introduced legislation to 
restore the $23,000-a-year pension former White House aide Oliver L. North lost 
because of his felony convictions in the Iran-Contra affair. Rep. William L. 
(Bill) Dickinson (R-Ala.) said North, a 20-year Marine veteran, has 
"demonstrated his willingness to give his life for his country" and should not 
be asked "to give up the security of his own family on charges that may not 
have been his doing." Dickinson's legislation would exempt North from a law 
that denies retirement pay to any government officer convicted of destroying 
government documents, one of three felony crimes for which North was convicted. 
The U.S. comptroller general on Monday rejected a recommendation from the Navy 
that North's pension be restored, saying there is "serious doubt" about whether 
North was entitled to retirement pay.

Officials warned residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and nearby 
islands to bolt down everything loose and stock up on food and water as 
Hurricane Dean rumbled through the eastern Caribbean. Dean was declared the 
second hurricane of the Atlantic season when winds picked up to 75 m.p.h., and 
the National Weather Center in Puerto Rico said it had strengthened to 80 
m.p.h. Hurricane warnings were posted for the Leeward Islands from Antigua to 
the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, said forecasters at the National 
Hurricane Center near Miami. "This is a dangerous storm and should not be taken 
lightly," an official advisory said.

The Senate passed far-reaching legislation that would exempt up to 10% of 
federal workers from the Civil Service uniform pay scale and allow the Defense 
and Energy departments to pay 525 scientists and engineers as much as $134,250 
a year. That level of compensation exceeds the $89,500 paid to members of 
Congress and Vice President Dan Quayle's $115,000 salary. The legislation 
includes limited exceptions to laws that prevent retired military officers from 
"double-dipping" and block Energy Department employees from going through the 
"revolving door" to work for private firms on the contracts they helped manage 
for the government. Double-dipping is the practice, mainly restricted, of 
simultaneously receiving a military pension and a full salary from government 
employment in a civilian post, for total government yearly pay of more than 
$75,500.

PROTEST BY ISRAELI WOMEN

<TEXT>

Security forces dragged a dozen praying women away from Judaism's holiest 
shrine, the Western Wall in Jerusalem, after disturbances erupted during a 
service. An Israeli group called Women at the Wall aroused anger among 
ultra-Orthodox Jews by holding collective prayers at the women's section of the 
wall. The ultra-Orthodox believe that women's voices should not be heard during 
prayer. About 50 of the women sat with linked arms to try to avoid being carted 
off. One of them, psychologist Marsha Pik, said, "At such a public, holy place 
it deeply offended me and made me think about women's place in Judaism."

S.D. JURY SAYS LUCAS SHOULD DIE FOR KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Allen Lucas, convicted of the throat-slashing murders of three people and 
the attempted murder of another after one of the longest trials in San Diego 
history, should die in the gas chamber, a jury recommended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, 34, a carpet cleaner from Spring Valley, showed no emotion as the jury 
delivered its recommendation, reached after seven days of deliberation, to San 
Diego Superior Court Judge Laura Palmer Hammes. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Patricia Katzenmaier, sobbed and said, "I love you, David," then 
bolted out the door and down the hallway outside Hammes' courtroom. Katzenmaier 
had cried softly and shook her head in disbelief as Hammes polled the jury -- 
twice -- to make certain that the verdict was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
Hammes will formally sentence Lucas on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad the jury came in with the verdict it did," said Michael Jacobs, whose 
wife and 3-year-old son were killed in 1979 in their Normal Heights home. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw no other verdict," Jacobs said. "I have no compassion for David Lucas, 
as he had none for my wife and child. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If (the verdict) is carried out, and it's a long process, I'm sure (Lucas) 
won't suffer as much as I've suffered." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Proper Penalty' 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel T. Williams, who led the prosecution, said he was 
"gratified the jury chose the penalty it did." Jurors could choose only death 
or life in prison without parole, and Williams said the jury chose the "proper 
penalty." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' assistant, George W. Clarke, said, "Justice was done today. This man 
has murdered many people and I think this was the appropriate penalty." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Alex Landon and Steven E. Feldman each said they were 
"disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, who conferred briefly with his lawyers after the verdict, was 
"reflective on what has happened," Landon said. "It's not a very pleasant 
situation to be in." 
</P>
<P>
Landon and Feldman said they will ask at the Sept. 19 hearing for a new trial, 
intending to challenge various rulings Hammes made as well as what Feldman 
called "other constitutional issues." They did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Marshals hustled jurors out a side door of the downtown courthouse and into a 
van about 20 minutes after the panel announced its verdict. Each juror declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The jury convicted Lucas of first-degree murder in the May 4, 1979, killings of 
Suzanne Jacobs, 31, her son, Colin, 3, and the Nov. 20, 1984, death of 
University of San Diego student Anne Catherine Swanke, 22. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs and her son were found in their Normal Heights home with their throats 
slashed. 
</P>
<P>
Swanke's throat also was slashed. Her body was found on a remote hillside in 
Spring Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors also convicted Lucas of the attempted murder of Jody Santiago-Robertson, 
34, of Seattle. She survived a June, 1984, attack in which she was choked and 
her throat was slashed. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas also was convicted of kidnaping Robertson, who testified for the 
prosecution at the trial, and of kidnaping Swanke. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas was acquitted in the death of Gayle Roberta Garcia, 29, a Point Loma 
realtor who was found with her throat slashed in a vacant Spring Valley house 
on Dec. 8, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were unable to convict Lucas in the deaths of Rhonda Strang, 24, and 
Amber Fisher, 3, both of Lakeside. Strang was baby-sitting the child when their 
throats were slashed Oct. 23, 1984. The jury foreman told Hammes that, after 
taking four or five votes, the jury was deadlocked, 11-1, for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas was arrested in December, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection began in August. The panel was not finally in place until Jan. 
3, when the trial began. It ran for 56 days. 
</P>
<P>
The jury's deliberations -- both in June when it debated conviction and in 
recent weeks when first the original and then a newly constituted panel 
considered Lucas' penalty -- also were marked by length. They also were 
accompanied by heightened secrecy and unusual events. 
</P>
<P>
After eight days of deliberations, the jury convicted Lucas on June 21 of the 
three murder charges, one charge of attempted murder and two related charges of 
kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
The jury began deliberating Lucas' sentence July 17. The next day, jurors sent 
Hammes a note saying they were deadlocked. That note was read in open court, 
and Hammes told jurors to resume deliberations, which they did the next day, 
July 19. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, July 24, after five days of deliberations, Hammes removed one of 
the jurors from the panel for "legal cause." She provided no further 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
The judge replaced the juror with an alternate, a woman, and told the jury to 
begin deliberations all over again, which it did later that day. 
</P>
<P>
The panel had deliberated every day since, except for one when a juror called 
in sick. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the juries spent 12 days deciding Lucas' penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, who has refused to reveal the jurors' names, ruled July 24 that the 
press did not have a right to see four other notes the jury wrote to her and 
the transcripts of hearings she held with the lawyers about those notes. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that jurors might learn through newspapers or television about 
jury instructions suggested by the lawyers but not used outweighed the public 
interest in knowing the contents of the notes and hearings, Hammes said in a 
written opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The Copley Press, which publishes the San Diego Union and the Tribune, 
immediately took that ruling to the 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego. 
But the court denied the appeal in a two-page order filed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Justices Charles W. Froehlich Jr., Patricia D. Benke and Gilbert Nares felt 
that the closed sessions Hammes held with the lawyers "are not the type which 
are historically open to the public," so Hammes was right to preclude the press 
and public, Froehlich said for the panel.

AL MARTINEZ: ALLRED ON A BACK ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This wasn't Gloria Allred's usual posture, sitting quietly in a courtroom off 
the beaten track, away from the crowds, ignored by the media, listening to 
herself being berated by another woman attorney more than equal to the task. 
</P>
<P>
The queen of the feminists was accustomed to a different set of circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
One sees her surrounded by television cameras on the steps of City Hall, or in 
the middle of a press conference outside a Beverly Hills restaurant, lashing 
the improprieties of a male-dominated society in a moment carefully 
orchestrated to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
That's the Allred we know, seizing the day in a flashy red dress, trailed by a 
media parade she has summoned in the first place, a strident exponent of 
women's rights, however trivial some of her cases may seem. 
</P>
<P>
Then why does she sit quietly now, demure in a purity-white suit, tight-lipped 
and nervous as shards of her life are scattered embarrassingly through a 
Glendale courtroom? 
</P>
<P>
Because this isn't the usual Allred Circus, folks. This is quiet personal drama 
rooted in emotional pain. This is the necessity to clean up when the party's 
over. 
</P>
<P>
This is the ultimate reduction of a feminist star to very human proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Allred's appearance before Superior Court Judge John Kalin isn't her shiniest 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is to determine how the assets of Allred and her ex-husband, Bill, 
should be divided. That would be unpleasant enough. It is made even more 
unpleasant by the fact he is in prison for selling bogus aircraft parts to the 
Air Force through a company he partially owns. 
</P>
<P>
They were divorced shortly after his conviction in 1987, and each is now 
seeking a share of the other's holdings. 
</P>
<P>
These are messy moments for anyone. The situation requires a cynical assessment 
of marriage, reduced to components of profit and interest. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom was almost empty. I sat through a morning of testimony because 
there seemed poetic justice in the personal travail of a woman who specializes 
in the travail of others. 
</P>
<P>
Instructed by her attorney not to discuss the case, Allred would only say, "We 
all have other experiences, and this is one of mine." Her response was muted, 
her manner reserved. 
</P>
<P>
One couldn't help but feel sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
Allred is wealthy and, God knows, famous, but all that seemed oddly irrelevant 
in the moment of her despair. I profiled her years ago, when she was still 
married, and can't help feeling uneasy about the contribution of that profile 
to her present circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
I characterized Bill Allred as a weak man dominated by a strong woman, and 
later she joked that the profile caused the divorce. I've never been sure it 
was a joke. 
</P>
<P>
I thought about that as I listened to Bill's attorney rip into Allred last 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Arlene Colman-Schwimmer is large, flamboyant and combative, with a reputation 
as vivid as the floral-print dress she was wearing. She dwarfs Allred both in 
size and expansive style. 
</P>
<P>
Schwimmer accused Allred of lying to protect her "lily-white reputation in the 
media" and charged that she badgered her own housekeeper in an effort to keep 
the woman from testifying. 
</P>
<P>
Allred's attorney, Paul Gutman, dealt with Schwimmer in the way Bill dealt with 
Allred, quietly and with fatherly patience. By selecting these lawyers, the 
Allreds almost seemed to have hired each other. 
</P>
<P>
It was a morning without movement until Judge Kalin interrupted the trial to 
preside over the routine dissolution of another marriage in open court. 
</P>
<P>
Dramas emerge at unexpected moments. While everyone watched, John and Lois 
Miller were called forward. An almost painfully ordinary couple, they stood 
awkwardly apart as Kalin asked if divorce was what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
They said it was, though there was deep sadness to their response. Routine 
questions followed, and then Kalin said, "That's it. You're dissolved," and in 
that moment of cold sanction, their life together was swept away like ashes in 
a gale. 
</P>
<P>
The Millers left the courtroom, and the Allred trial resumed. Gloria watched 
them leave. I couldn't read her expression, but I wondered if she was thinking 
about Bill, and I wondered if it was a memory laced with regret. 
</P>
<P>
We are all subject to pain at quiet times. Even a Gloria Allred must answer to 
the silence.

PEGGY BUCKEY SENDS NEARBY MURDER JURY BACK TO SQUARE ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a rare courthouse occurrence, a defendant in the McMartin Pre-School 
molestation trial caused jury deliberations in a neighboring murder trial to 
start all over again Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The jury in the murder trial of Harvey Rader was ordered to begin its 
discussions anew after one of its members was dismissed from the panel because 
of remarks she overheard Peggy McMartin Buckey make Tuesday in a courthouse 
elevator. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 63, was called as a witness Tuesday in the trial of Rader, accused of 
multiple murders, after it was reported that a juror in the case overheard 
Buckey discussing the case. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning from Superior Court Judge Lorna Parnell, Buckey said she 
briefly spoke about the case with a lawyer in an elevator in the downtown 
Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Felt Sorry 
</P>
<P>
"I said something like, 'I feel sorry for them (the parents of one of the 
murder victims). My heart goes out to them,' " she testified. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey said a woman in the elevator then identified herself as a juror in the 
Rader trial and Buckey ceased her conversation. 
</P>
<P>
However, the juror later told the court that she only heard Buckey say 
something about "Sol (one of the alleged murder victims)" going to England. 
</P>
<P>
The remark could be construed as giving credence to the defense, since the 
bodies of the four people Rader is accused of murdering have never been found. 
</P>
<P>
Rader, 41, a British citizen, is on trial in the murders of Israeli immigrant 
Shlomo Salomon; his wife, Elaine, and their two children, Michalle, 15, and 
Mitchell, 9, who disappeared from their Northridge home Oct. 12, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Parnell ruled Wednesday that the juror had been "contaminated" by Buckey's 
remarks and dismissed her. Jurors in criminal cases are only to consider 
evidence given at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The juror was replaced by a male alternate and the panel, which had been 
deliberating almost two weeks, began the task anew. 
</P>
<P>
Rader's attorney, Mark Lessem, said the problems with the juror may hurt his 
client's chances for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voices Concern 
</P>
<P>
"I'm frightened to death about what's going on here. I'm not sure my client's 
getting a fair trial," Lessem said. 
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that Buckey's comments may not have been accidental. 
</P>
<P>
"Before Mrs. Buckey testified (in the Rader trial Tuesday), I believed it was 
just a pure accident. . . . I could not believe a person could be that devious. 
After hearing Mrs. Buckey testify, I'm not so sure," he said, adding that he 
was "not a person who looks under the bed for conspiracies." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that the portly, gray-haired Rader was a business associate 
of Saloman and killed the family after an argument with him. If convicted, he 
could face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
In a 15th floor courtroom, down the hall from Rader's trial, Buckey and her 
son, Raymond, have been on trial for more than two years on charges they 
molested 11 of their pupils at the now-closed McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan 
Beach from 1978 until 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Buckey has been testifying since July 25.

OFFICERS IN SOUTH GATE END SICKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A two-day bout of "blue flu" among South Gate police officers involved in a 
contract dispute with the city ended Wednesday with officers reporting for work 
as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fortunate there were no emergencies" during the 48-hour sickout, said 
Police Chief Ron George, who canceled his vacation and donned a uniform to 
patrol the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Neither city officials nor police union spokesmen offered an explanation for 
the end of the walkout. However, City Council members were scheduled to reopen 
talks with police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, members of the South Gate Police Officers Assn., are asking for 
upward of 11% in salary and benefit increases while the city is offering 8% 
increases, City Hall sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective William Rickert, president of the police union, said the salary issue 
has aggravated a long-standing dispute between the officers and the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Rickert said the city has failed to keep the salaries of South Gate officers 
competitive with surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not asking to be the highest paid. We are just asking for equal pay," 
Rickert said. 
</P>
<P>
Rickert also denied that there had been a formal walkout by the officers. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand some officers called in sick, but there was no formal job 
action," Rickert said. "Officers did call in sick but there were off-duty 
officers that the city could have called but failed to do so." 
</P>
<P>
While a majority of the 81 officers participated in the sickout to protest the 
city's wage offer, crime-fighting was handled by top-ranking police 
administrators, a few inexperienced officers and unarmed community service 
employees.

REDONDO COUNCIL TO SPEND $50,000 ON ARCHITECT'S CONCEPTS FOR REBUILDING PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redondo Beach City Council, after a long and sometimes emotional debate 
over the future of the storm- and fire-damaged Redondo Pier, has agreed to pay 
an architect $50,000 to come up with a set of detailed concepts on how the 
structure might be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the council agreed Tuesday night to vote -- after it reviews 
the concepts -- on whether to let residents make the final decision on the 
pier's future. The decision was a compromise, with a minority of the council 
successfully pressing their colleagues to honor election pledges to hold a 
public vote on rebuilding the pier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equally Divided 
</P>
<P>
The audience of about 60 people appeared equally divided between advocates of 
rebuilding the pier and those who either opposed any reconstruction, or who 
favor a referendum on the issue before a decision is made. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Kay Horrell and Terry Ward said they needed more information to 
make a decision. "We should take this a step at a time," Horrell said. 
</P>
<P>
They were joined by Councilman Ron Cawdry in a 3-2 vote to hire Edward Carson 
Beall &amp; Associates of Torrance to prepare the concept drawings. Cawdry 
restated his longstanding position that "people elected me to make the tough 
decisions and I'm not going to cop out." However, Mayor Brad Parton immediately 
vetoed the decision, insisting that the council must make some form of 
commitment to involve the public in the pier decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make clear that I'm personally in favor of building an even better 
pier," he said. "But first I want to hear from the people." 
</P>
<P>
Parton's stand blocked further efforts by the majority to limit the council's 
decision to hiring the architect. Four votes on the five-member council are 
required to override the mayor's veto, and council members Steve Colin and 
Barbara Doerr were insistent on a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
"Some consensus building is needed . . . the pier is a very controversial 
issue," Doerr said. She said many residents have a "love-hate" attitude toward 
the 60-year-old structure. 
</P>
<P>
Horrell and Parton said their contacts with people during their campaigns 
convinced them that a majority favors rebuilding the pier. Most of the 
resistance, they said, comes from residents who live near the structure and 
object to the crowds and noise. 
</P>
<P>
Parton finally broke the impasse by guiding the council to a compromise 
proposed by Doerr -- the commitment to a formal council vote on the referendum 
issue after more information is acquired, and a change in one of three pier 
reconstruction alternatives in the original staff proposal. 
</P>
<P>
To provide what she termed a full range of options, Doerr said one of the 
options should focus on a "passive pier" of less than 6,000 square feet that 
would exclude any new restaurants and shops. About 40 businesses are operating 
on the old pier, which would remain. 
</P>
<P>
"Many piers just have a public building out there at the end, and some don't 
even have that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The other options are: Replace the approximately 21,500 square feet of 
commercial space lost to two ocean storms and a fire last year, or build a 
larger pier with 27,500 square feet reserved for restaurants and shops. The 
architect is not restricted in how large the non-commercial portion of the pier 
can be. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compromise Accepted 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4-1 to accept Doerr's compromise, with Cawdry opposed. 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious version of the pier project would cost the city about $6 
million, with another $2.5 million paid by private interests for building or 
reconstructing restaurants and shops, according to past estimates. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Tim Casey said the Beall pier concepts should be ready for council 
review in early or mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
In the staff proposal, which is based on past council and public discussions, 
the option replaced by Doerr's compromise would have provided 18,000 square 
feet for private development and a public building. 
</P>
<P>
The design firm will incorporate six levels of building density with one- and 
two-story height variations, a choice of three architectural styles and various 
theme possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1988 disasters, the pier's total area was about 100,000 square feet. 
About half of that total footage and 16 of 48 businesses were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speaker Rebuked 
</P>
<P>
At one point in more than three hours of debate Tuesday night, Councilwoman 
Horrell rebuked a speaker from the audience who seemed to imply that some 
council members were controlled by pier business interests. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm durned well not going to take that any more," Horrell shouted into her 
microphone. "Don't you ever, ever come in here again and accuse me of being in 
somebody's hip pocket. I'm not in anybody's pocket." 
</P>
<P>
When the audience member attempted to explain his remarks, Parton called him 
out of order and declared sternly that he would not tolerate attacks on the 
personal integrity of council members. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the council's move toward a pier rebuilding plan generally 
contended that the pier issue is too complex to submit to the public. "You have 
the information needed to make informed decisions," Judy Milner, a pier 
businesswoman, told the council. "We can't go back to town meetings (as a way 
of reaching community decisions)." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Reznick, a pier master leaseholder, urged the council to move ahead quickly 
with the architectural study. Continued inaction, he said, will cause more pier 
businesses to fail, leading to claims for damages against the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawyers Differ 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the pier businesses and City Atty. Gordon Phillips differ on the 
extent of the city's legal obligation to repair or replace the damaged pier. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the issue, some speakers said they aren't concerned about 
the fate of the pier businesses. "All they want is to make a fast buck," said 
Bud Moran, who lives near the pier. "They don't care about the quality of life" 
in nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Deloris Theissen was among several speakers who reminded council members of 
their campaign pledges. "You promised us a ballot," she said. "Before you spend 
any more money (on studies), let's have a vote by the people and let's make it 
legally binding." 
</P>
<P>
Casey said he doubted that such a vote could be legally binding on the council 
unless it was put on the ballot through an initiative petition. The issues 
related to the pier do not lend themselves to a "yes" or "no" ballot question, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
As alternatives, he suggested a survey by professional poll takers, or more 
public hearings and workshops on the pier issue. He said the issue raises three 
basic questions: Who will pay for a new pier? What will it look like? What 
types of businesses will be permitted? 
</P>
<P>
The answer to the first question has already been answered, Casey said. It 
should be possible to rebuild the pier without direct cost to local taxpayers. 
He said the state Office of Emergency Services will provide $2.7 million and 
the rest of the city's cost can be covered by federal disaster assistance, 
reserve funds from King Harbor operations and redevelopment money.

DOW PAYS A $117,000 FINE FOR HAZARDOUS-WASTE INFRACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dow Chemical Co. USA has paid a $117,000 fine after being cited for breaking 
state health laws by burning and storing hazardous waste at its Torrance 
polystyrene manufacturing plant. 
</P>
<P>
The March 31 citation also charged Dow with 11 other violations, including 
failure to label hazardous waste containers properly and failure to make 
emergency arrangements with Torrance Police and Fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the fine was for treating hazardous waste without the proper permit 
and for the storage of wastes in Torrance that came from a Dow facility in Long 
Beach, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Smalling, Dow manager of safety and environmental affairs, said the 
company maintains that its permit did allow burning of waste, but Dow has paid 
the fine rather than get entangled in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"At no time do we feel that we improperly handled our hazardous waste or 
endangered the surrounding public," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Health Services spokesman Jim Marxen said the violations 
did not directly threaten public health. He said the two major violations 
involved failure to have the proper permits for what Dow was doing. 
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the state Department of Health Services, Dow is continuing 
to burn waste at its Torrance plant, in the 300 block of Crenshaw Boulevard, 
while applying for a permit that specifically allows incinerating some of the 
wastes produced there. 
</P>
<P>
The incineration issue concerns hydrocarbon wastes, including styrene, 
partially polymerized styrene and ethyl benzene, which are produced during the 
manufacturing of polystyrene. Smalling said the plant makes "several hundred 
million pounds" of polystyrene a year, commonly used in packing material and 
food containers. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the waste from the polystyrene process, which can be as much as 
576,000 pounds a year, has been burned to heat a plant boiler ever since the 
Department of Health Services issued a permit to Dow in 1983 covering the 
processes at the plant. The permit states that "recovered hydrocarbons" would 
be used as boiler fuel. 
</P>
<P>
But during an inspection on Feb. 16, 1989, health services inspector Teena 
Suzuki, took note that the wastes were burned. Suzuki said she considered Dow's 
burning of the waste chemicals "a form of treatment," for which Dow did not 
have a permit and she cited Dow for it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passed Inspection 
</P>
<P>
However, Smalling said that the plant passed a health services inspection in 
1987 without any similar citation and that it has complied with limitations on 
air pollution imposed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki said that Dow officials had pointed to the earlier inspection and the 
language of the 1983 permit when informed that a citation was going to be 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
Marxen said that treatment must be specifically addressed in a permit. "If Dow 
had wanted treatment, and we had agreed to treatment, it would have said 
'treatment.' We have nothing against the boiler unit" but it needs a treatment 
permit and the inspections that would follow, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the Department of Health Services had not cited Dow after its 1987 
inspection, Suzuki said: "Some inspectors will see things that others don't." 
She added that the 1983 permit may have been faulty in including the language 
that Dow cited as authority to burn hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
The storage issue arises because Dow's permit only allows the company to store 
hazardous waste at the Torrance facility that is generated there. 
</P>
<P>
Smalling acknowledged that Dow had been storing hazardous waste generated at a 
Dow bulk liquid storage terminal in Long Beach. That material was not burned in 
Torrance but was shipped, along with other waste chemicals from the Torrance 
operation, to Louisiana or Texas where Dow has incinerator plants. 
</P>
<P>
The hazardous waste from the Long Beach facility consisted mainly of used 
filter cartridges, samples, styrene, ethyl benzene, partially polymerized 
styrene, acetone, and methylene chloride. 
</P>
<P>
Smalling said Dow used the Torrance plant for storage because "the Long Beach 
terminal is an arm of this operation. We looked at it as a satellite site." 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki said: "They misinterpreted the permit on the storage." 
</P>
<P>
Smalling said that Dow now sends waste directly from the Long Beach terminal to 
its incineration plants in Louisiana and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"In the interests of resolving the problem and getting on with correcting any 
deficiencies we may have had and assuring that the public health and welfare is 
maintained in the most efficient manner, we are going ahead with the 
corrections," said Smalling.

HOW GOLF COURSES HURT COASTLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is kind of fun to sit and dream and fantasize along with the Rancho Palos 
Verdes City Council as they ponder the construction of their fancy new golf 
course on the coastline (Times, July 20). 
</P>
<P>
As usual when shining and polishing up one of their pet projects, the council 
will not hear a discouraging word. Even the jolting news that this new course 
will cost about $19 million or $20 million (versus about $2 million for a 
shabby public course) and a round of golf may cost around $60 did not seem to 
faze our dreamy council persons. 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council will continue to spin their 
multimillion-dollar scenarios. They are much too far along now to slow their 
drive for a glitzy PV Riviera Ritz-Carlton coastline. But citizens of Rancho 
Palos Verdes and surrounding communities should take a hard look at some of the 
negatives involved. 
</P>
<P>
First off, with two championship golf courses (one for the Hon development and 
one for the Long Point Monaghan project) plus two giant hotels, untold 
convention centers and clubhouses and hundreds of units of tract housing 
stretching from Palos Verdes Estates to San Pedro -- all this ballooning 
traffic will push the peninsula into certain gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
We have very restricted entrance and exit corridors. Further, the caravans of 
thousands of dump trucks going and coming and clotting highways during 
construction will not make for easy living or happy motoring. 
</P>
<P>
Why should our splendid coastline be sacrificed for golf courses? If someone 
suggested putting hundreds of tennis courts or baseball or football or soccer 
fields along the coast, no one would listen. But for some reason, a golf course 
is acceptable to some people. But I believe that the Rancho Palos Verdes 
coastline is destined for better things. 
</P>
<P>
The prime consideration that makes it totally unfeasible to build a golf course 
along Subregions 1 and 2 is that both the Rancho Palos Verdes General Plan and 
the Coastal Specific Plan call for a bluff road and Class I hiking and biking 
trails running along the bluffs from Point Vicente to the Lunada Point Project 
near the Palos Verdes Estates border (see Coastal Specific Plan, Path &amp; 
Trail Networks, Page S1-9). The plans do not say put in a golf course, if you 
like. They call for a bluff road and trail networks. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes citizens and all peninsula residents should hold the 
council members' feet to the fire and insist that they stick to the original 
EIR plans developed for the city and for the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Of equal importance is the certain and standard use of toxic herbicides, 
pesticides and fungicides on the golf course greens and fairways. These toxic 
chemicals will inevitably drain down into the ocean, which is already heavily 
laden with DDT, PCBs and other outfall poisons. We do not need more toxic 
chemicals polluting our bays and beaches. Also there is the problem of heavy 
watering required by a championship golf course. This heavy watering could 
destabilize bluff and cliff sides and hillsides and (who knows) possibly even 
precipitate another landslide -- which we surely do not need. 
</P>
<P>
The bluffs and terrain in Subregion 2 are geologically unstable. The Rancho 
Palos Verdes public works, redevelopment agency and City Council are pleading 
and begging and forcing some residents near the Abalone Cove and Portuguese 
Bend landslides to expedite dewatering, install drainpipes on homes, eliminate 
septic tanks -- anything and everything to prevent water from hitting the 
ground. Yet right nearby at Point Vicente, on unstable terrain, the City 
Council wants to install a golf course requiring massive amounts of water on a 
daily basis. Does this make any sense? 
</P>
<P>
But let's face it, millions and millions of dollars are at stake here, and this 
overdevelopment locomotive will not be easy to stop. All interested citizens in 
Rancho Palos Verdes, around the peninsula and surrounding communities must 
write, wire or phone your city hall and the Rancho Palos Verdes City Hall and 
make your views known. 
</P>
<P>
Contact your mayor and council persons and tell them to bring force to bear. It 
is vital that the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council should stick to the basic 
General Plan and Coastal Specific Plan, and not rewrite it to aid 
overdevelopment. Remember, the tranquility you obtain and the gridlock you 
avoid can make for better living, a decent environment and an accessible 
coastline through the year 2000 and beyond.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 BUSINESS TAXES TO INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo council members have adopted a measure that will boost three 
existing business taxes and raise more than $6 million annually in new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which three weeks ago had been informally endorsed by voice 
vote, was approved 3 to 2. Council members Scot Dannen and Jim Clutter, who 
voted against it, favored imposing a payroll tax on business. 
</P>
<P>
The other council members, including Mayor Carl Jacobson, had initially 
supported a payroll tax, but changed their minds after representatives of the 
city's large aerospace industry lobbied against it. A payroll tax would have 
meant substantially higher tax bills for some of the city's major companies, 
such as Hughes Aircraft, that employ large numbers of well-paid professionals. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo officials have said that without new revenues, the city is facing a 
$1.6-million deficit in its $20-million operational budget this year, as well 
as further postponement of a number of capital improvement projects that it has 
not been able to afford. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, the employee tax will double to $120 per worker, and the 
square-footage tax for companies with more than 5,000 square feet will 
quadruple to 20 cents. In addition, an acreage tax imposed on some industrial 
businesses will increase from $300 to $500.

DODGERS CAN'T HELP BUT WALK INTO WIN OVER THE GIANTS, 7-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The cliche is not always right. When you are the Dodgers, and only one team in 
the league has a worse batting average than your .236, a walk is better than a 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Giant pitchers, answering an untimely call of the wild, sadly 
learned that Wednesday night. They gave the Dodgers three runs on bases-loaded 
walks. They set up another run on a walk and another on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows the best place for Dodger bats is their shoulders. Thus they 
won, 7-4, before 45,478 at Dodger Stadium despite getting only six hits. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the most inactive 11-run games in recent memory, the game was 
cinched, on a walk the Giants didn't allow. With runners on second and third 
and two out in the sixth inning, pitcher Steve Bedrosian did not intentionally 
walk Eddie Murray. And Murray lined a single to center to score the Dodgers' 
final two runs. Combined with his first-inning RBI on a walk, Murray has 16 
runs batted in in his last 19 at-bats and 62 RBIs overall. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger (Craig, Giant manager) probably figured the way his guys where throwing 
the ball, they might not get it over the plate anyway," said the Dodgers' Tom 
Lasorda after managing his 2,000th game. "Roger is a great manager, he knows 
what he is doing." 
</P>
<P>
Craig is also a worried manager. If pitching wins championships, the Giants 
better leave town while they have some left. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did they lose their composure Wednesday, the National League West 
leaders lost two starters with a chance they might lose a third. 
</P>
<P>
This series started ominously enough for the Giants when Tuesday's starter 
Scott Garrelts left the game in the sixth inning with a stiff right elbow. He 
could be out. 
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday's game things grew considerably worse when pitcher Rick 
Reuschel was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained muscle in his 
right groin. He was 13-5 with a 2.45 earned-run average. He will probably miss 
three starts. 
</P>
<P>
Then in Wednesday's third inning, shortly after the Reuschel announcement, 
starter Atlee Hammaker went out, spraining his left knee while sliding into 
second base in the third inning. He was carried off the field on a stretcher. 
He was placed on the 21-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
The bad luck nearly reached a ludicrous point during the next inning when 
Hammaker's replacement, Trevor Wilson, was hit in the arm by a Ramon Martinez 
pitch. But Wilson stayed in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Giants' minor leaguers Russ Swan, Randy McCament and Ernie Camacho 
are all being recalled from triple-A Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a tough couple of weeks, we've got to keep our head above 
water," Craig said, shaking his head. "We've got a chance of losing three 
starters in three days." 
</P>
<P>
And then for Craig to watch his pitchers be so generous Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't win this game," he said of the Dodgers. "We gave it to them." 
</P>
<P>
Four of the six Giants' pitchers gave up at least one walk. They totaled eight, 
equaling a Dodger season high. The Giants even walked Martinez, the Dodger 
starter and winner, with the bases loaded. It was his first major league walk 
and first RBI. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very generous tonight," said Murray, who was walked on four 
consecutive pitches to drive in the Dodgers' first run after starter Hammaker 
had loaded the bases on a walk and two singles. "I could have swung at that 
pitch, but at 3-and-0, I wasn't even going to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's crowd put the Dodgers over the 2-million mark in attendance for the 
17th consecutive season. They have drawn 2,033,331. . . . After 2,000 games, 
Lasorda is 1,070-930, a .535 percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels, who has hit .342 since coming to the Dodgers July 18, didn't start 
Wednesday because of right knee problems. In his 12 games as a Dodger, it was 
the second time he missed a start because of the injury. "It's part of my 
rehabilitation -- I take a day off when it flares up and then go back the next 
day," said Daniels, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on the knee in May. 
"I'll keep working to get it strong, and then I'll keep it strong." . . . 
Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser missed Wednesday's game because he had the flu 
but is expected to make his scheduled start today. The last time Hershiser 
missed a game with a virus, he came back the next night to throw a four-hitter, 
beating Chicago, 4-1, on July 18. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger announcer Don Drysdale will return to the air tonight after missing 
nearly two weeks with heart problems. In squelching rumors that Drysdale might 
be out for the season, Dr. Mickey Mellman said that Drysdale was fully 
recovered from an angioplasty performed on his heart July 21 after Drysdale 
complained of chest pains. An angioplasty is the non-surgical opening of a 
partially blocked blood vessel with a balloon-like device. "He's fine," Mellman 
said. "Everything has checked out fine." . . . The Dodgers acquired left-hander 
Ed Vosberg, who will join triple-A Albuquerque as the player to be named in 
last week's deal that sent outfielder prospect Javier Ortiz to Houston.

TOKYO WOES; 
</P>
<P>
SOME RAM PLAYERS SAY THEY HAVE BEEN TREATED LIKE UGLY AMERICANS DURING VISIT 
</P>

<P>
The Rams landed in Tokyo this week with what seemed a higher calling than mere 
football, bound to the resolve of owner Georgia Frontiere, who has once more 
extended a kind hand across the sea. 
</P>
<P>
But for at least some of the players, the good will ended just outside the 
gates of their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the London trip two years ago, when the Rams roamed the streets freely, 
some players found the locals less than hospitable. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the team's first night in Tokyo, defensive end Doug Reed and 
several teammates set out to explore the city's metropolitan section. Reed 
vowed Wednesday to change his yen back to dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going out anymore," Reed said. "I'm going to sit in the hotel, and buy 
myself one of these VCR recorders. I'm finished. I'm forcing myself to spend 
all the money I have so I have no choice but to sit in my room and play with my 
fingers." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said a group of black players, including cornerback LeRoy Irvin, safeties 
Vince Newsome and James Washington, nose tackle Alvin Wright and fullback 
Buford McGee, were turned away from nearly every night spot they tried to 
enter. 
</P>
<P>
When they attempted to return to the hotel after getting caught in a rainstorm, 
the players said cab drivers refused them service. Reed asked several 
pedestrians for assistance, but said he was repeatedly shunned. Eventually, an 
American women offered help. 
</P>
<P>
Newsome thought the Japanese, especially the cab drivers, were intimidated by 
the football players' size. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really structured for Americans," Newsome said. "And for black 
Americans, it's going to really be a rough road. The (Japanese) are really 
intimidated. They have these stereotypes." 
</P>
<P>
Reed was more angered than Newsome by the reception. In 1981, he played in the 
Mirage Bowl here while attending San Diego State University. He remembered 
being treated much better then. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt almost like going back to slavery, with no blacks allowed," Reed said. 
"Or no Mexicans, whatever. When someone says 'No foreigners,' I mean, what is 
this? I've got this foreign currency. I've got your money in my pocket. And I 
can't go in certain places? What's wrong with my money? You guys come to the 
United States and it's a free for all. And for them to have a barrier set up 
for us? Life is something." 
</P>
<P>
The players had an interpreter on the trip, Taro Tsujii, a friend of Irvin's 
who had stayed with him during a recent visit to Southern California. It turns 
out he wasn't much help. 
</P>
<P>
Of the cab drivers, Reed said: "They had on their little red flashing light, 
meaning they're available. We'd go up to a car and they'd turn it off real 
quick." 
</P>
<P>
Tsujii, who actually doesn't speak much English, said it wasn't so much a case 
of racism as the cab drivers being intimidated by the group of large players. 
Several drivers told the players they were too big to ride in their cabs. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of joked about it, saying maybe it's because we're Shaka Zulus or 
something," Reed said. "You know, it's really intended for all Americans. But 
probably us more than white Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said he was later told the players were in the wrong part of town, and 
that another section of the city was more "Americanized." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Mark Jerue, who is white, said he had no problems traversing the 
city the same evening. He spent part of the night at the Hard Rock Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the obstacles, the theme of good will has survived the week. 
</P>
<P>
Others might view American Bowl '89 as a mere exhibition between the Rams and 
San Francisco 49ers, a minor prelude to an upcoming regular season. 
</P>
<P>
But it's more than that for Frontiere, who for one week can call the world her 
stage. This is the second foreign exhibition game in three years for the Rams, 
with a promise of more to come. 
</P>
<P>
"NFL football is a giant step toward improved international relations and the 
bonding of man," she said in her address to the Japanese media shortly after 
the team's arrival Tuesday evening. "It also gives an opportunity to the teams 
to experience other cultures and become good-will ambassadors of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our most popular game and we bring it to you to share as our brothers and 
sisters," Frontiere told the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
But such a trip -- involving 285 players, coaches, trainers, staff and guests 
-- also requires hard work. There are 6,800 pounds of equipment to consider -- 
helmets, shoes, footballs, tackling dummies, recording equipment, towels, 
gloves. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't have a clue," Dick Beam, the team's director of operations, said 
of the preparations. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago in London, before the Rams' exhibition game against Denver, 
assistant equipment manager Todd Hewitt was held up five hours in customs 
because one of his trunks was mislabeled. 
</P>
<P>
Beam began preparations for the Tokyo trip last March and made two visits 
before this week. Coordinating plans for hotels, buses, practice schedules, 
meals, tours, meeting rooms, dressing rooms and visas presents a unique set of 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The language barrier is the main thing," Beam said. "What it did was extend 
every meeting two to three times longer than if both parties spoke English. 
Once you break that, and have them understand what you need, they are extremely 
cordial and have responded positively for every thing we've asked for." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, there are cultural barriers to overcome. Trainer Jim Anderson was 
asked this week if his players would be needing hot tea on the sidelines. 
Anderson could only laugh at the thought of 285-pound tackle Jackie Slater 
calling for his tea during a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
Equipment manager Don Hewitt is relying on the hotel laundry service to clean 
80 uniforms each day. He's holding his breath. 
</P>
<P>
To apprise his team of the cultural differences, Beam prepared a sheet of 
reminders for each player, some of which included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be aware that many Japanese are heavy smokers. At the same time Japanese do 
not find chewing gum attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Japanese are accustomed to the simple handshake. Avoid hugging, kissing or 
embracing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't worry about pauses in conversation. The Japanese do not necessarily 
carry on an unbroken flow of conversation the way most Americans do. . . . Ask 
questions about their daily life and surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Still, several players acknowledge privately that they'd rather be in training 
camp, which is kind of like saying they'd rather be at the dentist. 
</P>
<P>
"These are distractions," one said. "It's just natural for us to think we're on 
vacation. There are temptations that people just can't keep themselves from. 
It's wonderful that teams are able to travel, but it seems like we've been 
picked every year." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Frontiere has lobbied hard for her team's overseas excursions and is 
already talking of a game next summer in Milan, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The trips aren't necessarily profitable for Frontiere and the Rams. The team 
claims to have broken even two years ago in London. Some of the costs for this 
trip are absorbed by the game's sponsors, primarily Toshiba. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd almost rather stay in Fullerton," another player said. 
</P>
<P>
There are also aspects of the heated rivalry with the 49ers that extend beyond 
the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are staying at the same hotel this week. And it's no secret the Rams 
have long been envious of 49er owner Edward DeBartolo's deep pockets. He's 
known in the business to pay top prices for his players. In turn, the team has 
rewarded him with three Super Bowl championships in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Ram players were not shocked to learn 49er players were staying in a nicer wing 
of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, a coin flip by the NFL office decided that issue, though it is true 
that each 49er has a room to himself while the Rams have been asked to double 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the intensity of the rivalry, the Rams and 49ers won't be 
scrimmaging this week before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, for one, has witnessed enough intensity for one week. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like once you're outside the hotel, it's like 'Who are you?' We get 
everything we want within this area right here. But don't leave. This is your 
palace. Don't leave the gates. There are peasants out there who will tear you 
apart."

WHARTON BREAKS U.S. RECORD IN 400 MEDLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
David Wharton, competing in his home pool, set the first record of the U.S. 
Swimming Long Course National Championships Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Wharton lowered his American record in the men's 400-meter individual medley to 
4 minutes 15.93 seconds in the University of Southern California pool. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojan star is competing at this meet in the name of Team Foxcatcher, his 
club team back home in Pennsylvania. But he will be back at USC as a junior in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Namesnik pushed Wharton to the record, staying with Wharton through the 
fastest butterfly leg Wharton has ever recorded. Namesnik took the lead on the 
backstroke leg, stayed close through the breaststroke and pushed Wharton to his 
fastest freestyle leg ever. 
</P>
<P>
And that's pretty fast, considering Wharton once held the world record in the 
400 individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
Wharton said that his first priority was to win the event and secure a berth on 
the Pan Pacific team that will be competing in Tokyo next month. "I was kind of 
nervous because I hadn't made the team yet," Wharton said. "Getting the record 
was an added bonus I'll certainly take. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt smooth tonight . . . Coming home I felt really strong." 
</P>
<P>
Wharton won the silver medal in this event in the 1988 Olympic Games, finishing 
behind Tamas Darnyi of Hungary. Darnyi set the world record of 4:14.75. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he will be taking special notice of Darnyi's time in the upcoming 
European Championships in Bonn, Wharton smiled. "Of course," he said. "What 
he's done isn't out of my ballpark yet. . . . My objective will be to go faster 
in Tokyo." 
</P>
<P>
Wharton holds the American records in both the 200-yard and the 400-yard 
individual medleys and has been voted National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
swimmer of the year the last two years. He said that with the experience he has 
had in international swimming in the last few years, he is starting to feel 
more confident in that arena, too. 
</P>
<P>
He will be swimming the 200-meter individual medley here Friday night. "I'll be 
a lot more relaxed and confident for the 200, now that I've made the team," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans of the Fullerton Aquatic Sports Team won her second national title 
of the meet, in the 400-meter freestyle. But her 4:06.73 was no threat to the 
world record -- 4:03.85 -- that she set in winning the gold medal in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Heike Friedrich of East Germany chased her in Seoul. And no one chased her 
Wednesday. She is going to have to get used to that. 
</P>
<P>
Olympians Betsy Mitchell and Dan Veatch both came out of retirement to win 
backstroke titles Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell won the women's 100-meter backstroke in 1:02.37, and Veatch won the 
men's 200-meter backstroke in 2:02.09. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's performance was especially impressive considering that her time, 
after only a few weeks of training, beat the 1:02.53 she swam here in '84 to 
win the Olympic silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell at one time held world records in both the 100- and 200-meter 
backstrokes and still holds the record in the 200. She was about as burned out 
as a swimmer can get when she scratched from the 200 during the U.S. Olympic 
trials last summer in her own University of Texas pool and then, after 
finishing fourth in the 100 in Seoul, scratched from the medley relay. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling that would come up," Mitchell said. "I thought that would 
probably look pretty bad. I wasn't making a statement or anything with that 
scratch. I just felt like I wasn't going to go faster than Beth (Barr) was 
going to go. She was going faster at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at the end of a really long rope . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't really horrible being at the Olympics, but things were really 
different for me once I was a world record-holder. To tell you the truth, it 
was probably me assuming that people were putting the pressure on me. . . . 
Tonight I had fun swimming for the first time in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, 23, had been coaching at her alma mater, the Mercersburg Academy in 
Pennsylvania, when she decided in early July that she wanted to swim again. She 
drove to Stanford in her jeep to work out with her former college coach, 
Richard Quick. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Lang of Club Wolverine, a member of the 1988 Olympic team as a relay 
swimmer, won the 100-meter freestyle in 50.17. Nichole Haislett won the women's 
100-meter freestyle in 56.15. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
The last time Carrie Steinseifer competed in a championship final in the USC 
pool, she finished in a tie with Nancy Hogshead to win the 1984 Olympic gold 
medal in the 100-meter freestyle. Steinseifer finished in a tie for sixth place 
with Janel Jorgensen Wednesday. . . . Tom Jager tuned up for his 50-meter swim 
against Matt Biondi on Friday by swimming the 100-meter freestyle Wednesday. He 
finished third in 50.4, earning a spot on the Pan Pacific team. The top four 
finishers in the 100-meter freestyle make it in order to fill the 400-meter 
freestyle relay. . . . Longhorn Aquatics led the team competition after the 
third day, leading also in both the men's competition and the women's 
competition.

BLYLEVEN PUTS SMILES BACK ON ANGELS, 7-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer

<P>
When they're feeling a little low and things just don't seem to be going their 
way, the Angels see Bert Blyleven's name on the lineup card and they put on a 
happy face. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven might be baseball's premier prankster, but he not only specializes in 
hotfoots, he also has this thing about shutting down hot teams. So, while the 
Angels may laugh at his practical jokes all week, every fifth game they're 
usually smiling for a different reason. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran right-hander is the Angels' No. 1 losing-streak stopper. When they 
lost seven in a row in mid-June, he beat the Tigers, 9-4, in Detroit. When they 
suffered five consecutive defeats in mid-July, he pitched a complete-game, 
five-hitter for a 1-0 victory in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
And he's still riding high in August. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night in the Kingdome, Blyleven was up to his old tricks, putting the 
brakes on a three-game Angel skid and the whammy on the Seattle Mariners for a 
7-0 Angel victory in front of 11,460. 
</P>
<P>
It was Blyleven's 58th career shutout, tying him with Don Sutton for eighth on 
the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy is too much," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "He can do remarkable 
things for a ballclub. I don't think godsend is too strong a word, when you 
consider his production both on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a joy to be around. He has a tremendous sense of humor, but he also has 
been terrific on the field, and that's vitally important to make it all wash." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven also whitewashed the Mariners the last time he faced them, coming out 
of the Kingdome with a 10-0 victory April 16. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he gave up only six hits while recording six strikeouts and improved 
to 11-2. He also lowered his earned-run average to 2.31, second best in the 
American League, and boosted his league-leading winning percentage to .846. 
</P>
<P>
While Blyleven was taking care of the Mariner batters, the Angel hitters went 
back to their favorite weapon -- the home run -- to take care of three 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Designated hitter Tony Armas, filling in for slumping Brian Downing, and 
catcher Bill Schroeder, replacing Lance Parrish, added their names to the Angel 
long-ball list. And Jack Howell, who leads the team in homers, hit his 17th of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
But this was Blyleven's night to shine. He has six no-decisions in his last 11 
starts and could "very easily have 15 or 16 wins without even stretching it," 
according to Rader. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an important game," Blyleven said, "and you do dig a little deeper, go 
a little harder in a game like this. But it shouldn't be pressure, it should be 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
"And when you get seven runs and some big double plays like we did tonight, 
that makes it fun." 
</P>
<P>
Twice, the Angels turned double plays to clear the bases before the Mariners' 
hot-hitting first baseman, Alvin Davis, came to the plate. But Blyleven never 
gave up more than one hit in an inning and Seattle managed to push get only one 
runner as far as third base. Mike Kingery got to third with one out in the 
ninth, but Blyleven struck out Jim Presley and pinch-hitter Dave Cochrane to 
end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the shutout there," Blyleven said. "I just tried to pitch Presley a 
little differently than I had in his first three at-bats." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels got two unearned runs off starter Jerry Reed in the second inning. 
Wally Joyner started the inning with a sharp ground ball to first that took a 
wicked bounce off the edge of the turf around the bag. The ball deflected off 
Davis' glove and was ruled an error. 
</P>
<P>
Armas followed with a double that skipped past third and ended up in foul 
territory down the left-field line, Joyner scoring from first. Chili Davis 
slapped a line-drive single to right, moving Armas to third. Armas scored to 
give the Angels a 2-0 lead when Schroeder hit into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Armas made the score 3-0 in the fourth with his eighth homer of the season, a 
line drive that landed well beyond the fence in center field. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels blew it open in the seventh when the first four batters ended up 
crossing it in a hurry. Armas doubled, Davis beat out a grounder to third and 
Schroeder pounded a drive deep into the second deck in right. Howell also went 
to the opposite field, belting a home run to left. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven did the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything nice you want to write about Bert Blyleven is fine with me," Rader 
said. "Just put my name next to it because it applies." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven wanted to make sure Rader got some of the credit for holding a short, 
informal pregame meeting during which he told his players to relax, have fun 
and just play the game. It's a philosophy the 38-year-old Blyleven has thrived 
on during his 20 years in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at baseball as fun," he said, "and I'm fortunate to be playing it. 
Despite what Hank Aaron says, there are people who still love this game. I love 
this game." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously deciding that was far too serious a note to end an interview with, 
Blyleven quickly added: 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I'm playing this game because I couldn't be a brain surgeon. I would 
have loved doing brain surgery, too, but I didn't finish high school." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Designated hitter Brian Downing, who has four hits in his last 40 at-bats, got 
Wednesday night off after a pregame talk with Manager Doug Rader. "He wants to 
work on his stroke," Rader said. "He's all out of whack and the best thing to 
do is keep him out and let him clear his mind. He came in, we talked and both 
decided the best thing is to back off and let him clear his mind." Rader said 
that Downing has been trying to make adjustments during games and that it's 
better to take extra batting practice, attempt to isolate the problem and then 
work on it. "Sometimes, you feel like you're in a whirlpool that keeps pulling 
you down and down," Rader said. "You just can't go up there trying to make 15 
adjustments and have any success." . . . Catcher Lance Parrish, who slightly 
hyper-extended his left knee Monday night and aggravated the injury Tuesday 
night, also got a rest Wednesday. Trainer Ned Bergert said Parrish was be 
available if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Devon White, who had seven home runs by May 25, has hit only two 
since and has not hit a homer since June 24. "He's been pressing, like Wally 
(Joyner) was earlier," hitting instructor Deron Johnson said. "He just needs to 
get back in the groove where he's hitting the ball in the air instead of 
hitting the hard ground ball." Johnson says that it's important to remember 
that White is still somewhat of a raw talent. "He's got so much ability, you 
just figure he should do so much," he said, "but he's still learning." One 
thing the free-swinging White clearly needs to learn is the strike zone. "He 
has to get more disciplined up there," Johnson said. "He has at-bats where he 
never swings at a strike. The pitcher doesn't get him out as much as he gets 
himself out." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner and Parrish were the Angels' hottest hitters last month. Joyner hit .333 
with five home runs, 25 runs batted in and scored 18 runs. Parrish hit .325 
with six homers, 16 RBIs and 14 runs. The Angels' top two relievers were 
considerably less successful in July. Bryan Harvey was 2-2 with five saves and 
a 3.64 earned-run average. He struck out 12, but gave up eight walks and four 
home runs in 12 1/3 innings. Greg Minton had one save, and a 5.68 ERA. He 
struck out four, walked five and gave up 12 hits and eight earned runs in 12 
2/3 innings.

NINE YEARS HAVEN'T HEALED LEONARD-DURAN RIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
There he was at the head table, the fearsome fighter they once called Manos de 
Piedra (Hands of Stone). Nowadays, he looks more like Manos de Twinkies. 
</P>
<P>
He sat impassively, elbows on the table, his chin in his hands. Then promoter 
Bob Arum introduced his long-time rival, Sugar Ray Leonard, and summoned him to 
the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Duran actually smiled slightly . . . and vigorously applauded Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. That's Duran, Roberto Duran, applauding Sugar Ray Leonard? No. 
An impostor, surely. Or was it a mirage? 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end, Duran became a little surly, as in the old days. But for a few 
seconds, Roberto Duran seemed free of some old demons. 
</P>
<P>
This was at the Golden Nugget Hotel Wednesday, at a news conference to announce 
the site of Leonard-Duran III, an event promoter Bob Arum calls "Uno Mas." 
</P>
<P>
It was a party, in a way, to introduce Steve Wynn as the new player in boxing's 
big leagues. His gleaming white, high-rise hotel, the Mirage, which has risen 
to near-completion next door to Caesars Palace, will hold the fight Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
So Leonard and Duran, who began the decade in Montreal with what some call the 
best fight of the decade, will finish the 1980s with an overweight Duran 
pushing 40 and Leonard in suspect shape after a disappointing performance 
against Tommy Hearns in a June draw. 
</P>
<P>
It has been said by nearly everyone in boxing the last few years that once Wynn 
opened his hotel and went into the boxing business, he would drive up the site 
fees of top boxing shows. But in this case, it didn't happen, all the 
principals agreed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a bidding war at all," said Mike Trainer, Leonard's lawyer and a 
co-promoter, with Arum, for Leonard-Duran III. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked to Caesars Palace first, told them what we had in mind, then we 
talked to Donald Trump's people (at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, N.J.), and 
then Steve flew to Bethesda (Md.) to see me. Steve and I made a deal in about 
10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, Steve said, 'How much will it cost me? What's the date?' then, 'OK, 
let's do it.' Trump put the same number ($8 million, which Wynn confirmed 
Wednesday) on the table. Caesars went under that and was either unable or 
unwilling to match it. Caesars also wanted an option on Ray's next fight, which 
was unacceptable to us. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, Caesars felt Steve was not a threat to them on this fight, 
but they were afraid he'd come back in the spring and blow everyone out of the 
water and get Ray's next fight." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Trainer said, the site was Leonard's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a reason for this fight," Leonard said. "Roberto Duran wants to 
vindicate himself." 
</P>
<P>
Then Leonard added, with a smile: "And I like the idea of being the first act 
at the Mirage." 
</P>
<P>
His first reference was to Leonard-Duran II, the 1980 rematch in New Orleans, 
when Duran quit in the middle of the eighth round, saying, "No mas, no mas," to 
referee Octavio Meyran. 
</P>
<P>
He has never explained why he quit that night, but Wednesday Duran promised to 
fully explain "No mas" immediately after Uno Mas. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the biggest disappointment of my career, and you'll know why (it 
happened) after the fight," he told reporters Wednesday, through an 
interpreter. Many wanted to know what the 38-year-old Duran weighed. The range 
of guesses was from 185 to 205. Whatever, he has to come down several weight 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
"My weight is no problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He might be right. He was also in the 190- to 200-pound range six weeks before 
he fought Iran Barkley last February, somehow got down to 160, and upset 
Barkley for what has become a $7.5-million victory. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Duran will make Dec. 7. Then he will have a painful visit to the 
Las Vegas office of the IRS. Duran has a back-tax bill of $1.5 million, which 
will come off the top of the $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Duran, at the microphone, turned tough. Moments before, Leonard said that he'd 
"always" wanted to fight Duran again. 
</P>
<P>
Duran pointed at Leonard and asked: "If you've always wanted to fight me, why 
did you wait nine years?" 
</P>
<P>
He also said he would have to knock out Leonard because "the judges like you 
here," possibly a reference to the June 12 Leonard-Hearns draw that most 
thought Hearns won. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, 33, who is said to have made $14.2 million from the Hearns fight, will 
make about $15 million, according to Trainer. That will put him over $100 
million for his career. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn, who said he will hold the fight in a 16,400-seat outdoor arena protected 
by wind barriers, said the Mirage will open in late November, about a week 
ahead of schedule.

HINTS THAT GIBSON MAY BE OUT UNTIL 1990 DON'T SURPRISE TEAM

The strong hints that Kirk Gibson might be out until next year have not taken 
the weary Dodgers by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"You just throw up your hands," third baseman Jeff Hamilton said Wednesday. 
"Things like this have been happening to us all year. We've learned, you've got 
to play no matter what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda: "The thing that matters is him getting well. 
At this point, that's all we care about." 
</P>
<P>
The question is, when will Gibson get well? He went on the 15-day disabled list 
July 23 with a sprained right knee and chronic left hamstring strain, but late 
Tuesday night hinted that he may be out for longer. 
</P>
<P>
'I've tried rehabilitating and then playing twice, and it hasn't worked either 
time," said Gibson, who rejoined the club Tuesday after doctors in Michigan 
confirmed what he had learned from the Dodgers -- the area around both knees is 
inflamed, and the only cure is rehabilitation and rest. Thus far, that has been 
no cure. 
</P>
<P>
"So I rehabilitate it and then go back and run on it and it gets worse again -- 
what happens then?" Gibson said. "I can't keep doing that." 
</P>
<P>
An option, Gibson said, would be exploratory surgery, in which case his season 
would be finished. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to run on it, and give it one last shot, and then decide," Gibson 
said. "If exploratory surgery is an alternative for me, I don't want to wait 
until I have to be rehabilitating next spring. I tried that this year and 
couldn't catch up." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he thought he would return this year, Gibson said: "I can't read 
a crystal ball, I don't know. If I strengthen myself to where I can run and run 
well, yes. But I have no way of knowing." 
</P>
<P>
Neither would Lasorda predict if Gibson would return this year. "If I could 
tell you that, I would be an outstanding surgeon at the Mayo Clinic," he said.

CHUCKWAGONS ARE LOADED, WITH MONEY, IN CALGARY STAMPEDE; 
</P>
<P>
RANGELAND DERBY HAS BECOME ONE OF BIGGEST EVENTS IN CANADIAN RODEO 
</P>

CALGARY, Canada

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A horn sounds and pandemonium breaks loose. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen outriders, holding their horses' reins in their teeth, toss imitation 
camp stoves and tent poles into four chuckwagons, then mount up as the 
four-horse teams lunge forward. Each circles its assigned barrels before 
charging around the track with its four outriders in frantic pursuit -- 32 
horses and four wagons hell-bent for leather. 
</P>
<P>
It's another heat of the Calgary Stampede's Rangeland Derby, the Indy 500 of 
chuckwagon racing. 
</P>
<P>
How quaint, you say? Cranky old Gabby Hayes always played the role. Dadrat the 
dadratted, goldang, bushwackin' sidewinder, Gabby couldn't gum his way through 
this one. 
</P>
<P>
Mix the "Ben Hur" chariot race with the Indians chasing John Wayne across the 
plains in "Stagecoach," and you have an idea of what chuckwagon racing is. 
</P>
<P>
The 19th-Century origins were impromptu races of the cook-tent covered wagons 
from the prairie into some nearby town after a long day on the range, but the 
races are not exhibitions. At stake is $299,550 in prize money, including 
$50,000 in the winner-take-all final for the four teams with the best 
accumulated times through nine nights of heats. 
</P>
<P>
The winner this year was Buddy Bensmiller of Dewberry, Alberta, with all four 
wagons less than three-quarters of a second apart after one lap around the 
5/8-mile Stampede track. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Lewis, 52, a one-eyed driver from Grand Prairie, Alberta, won last year, 
after Dallas Dorchester, 42, of Falun, Alberta, was disqualified for being over 
the line when the horn sounded. 
</P>
<P>
"Eight inches," Dorchester said. "I just jumped ahead before the horn went, eh? 
I knew I was over. I thought they might give me the benefit of the doubt, 
seein' as how I was pulling back." 
</P>
<P>
With a shrug, he figures it cost him $65,000 overall, including the use of a 
new pickup truck for a year. That's a few years' hay crop for most of the 
competitors, but Dorchester doesn't blame it on his lead horse. 
</P>
<P>
"I blame it more on the crowd," he said. "We pulled in (to the starting line), 
the crowd just roared and he jumped. I've got the same (lead) horse back. I 
don't hold it against him." 
</P>
<P>
And nobody called Lewis' victory a fluke. He had won six of his previous nine 
heats, and ran well enough in others to collect another $25,000 in "day money." 
</P>
<P>
This year, when he wasn't running as well, he said, "If things don't pick up, 
the truck is gone." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis didn't reach the final this year. So long, truck. Dorchester finished 
fourth. Easy come, easy go. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, cowboys aren't whiners. They don't waste time and energy cursing 
their bad luck. They take what comes and go on to the next go-round. 
</P>
<P>
And among modern-day athletes, chuckwagon racers would never be described as 
overpaid or over-pampered. Most are middle-aged products of the western 
Canadian plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan. 
</P>
<P>
Take Orville Strandquist. 
</P>
<P>
"You takes your chances," he said. "There's no guarantee of anything. No 
pension. Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Strandquist, from Stettler, Alberta, is a wiry 69. He's been racing wagons 
since 1941 and has no plans to retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I like rodeo," Strandquist said as several of his grandchildren played around 
his motorhome. "I rode bulls here in '37." 
</P>
<P>
He also worked as an outrider for other wagon drivers until five years ago, and 
not many years ago drove wagons in two races a night and was an outrider in the 
seven others. He competed against the grandfathers of some of his current 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones I used to run with all quit," Strandquist said. "So I'm runnin' with 
the young 'uns now." 
</P>
<P>
Strandquist says it isn't the same as it used to be -- in competition, safety 
and especially not in money. 
</P>
<P>
The Calgary Stampede rodeo was born in 1912 but struggled until a trick roper 
named Guy Weadick incorporated chuckwagon races into the competition in '23. 
Even now, the rodeo events are held during the day, the wagon races at night, 
and Strandquist says it's plain to see what carries the show. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something to get 50, 60 dollars day money. It's just been the last few 
years (the money) got big. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy to get it, but look at the stands in the daytime and then at 
night. If it wasn't for the wagons, rodeo couldn't pay its own way." 
</P>
<P>
Money doesn't represent the only change over the years. The sport has become 
reasonably safe only in the last couple of years, since a series of spectacular 
accidents in the '86 Stampede killed 11 horses, with footage on ABC's "Wide 
World of Sports" outraging animal lovers everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
An outrider was trampled and killed in races at Cheyenne's Frontier Days two 
years ago. The wagon drivers don't wear seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
But nowadays judges watch competitors closely and impose penalty seconds for 
interference and other infractions. The stoves the outriders throw into the 
wagon and the barrels they circle at the start must be collapsible. The stoves 
are stowed inside the wagon, not on a tailgate hanging off the rear end where a 
following horse can step on one -- which precipitated the worst '86 pileup at 
Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
"With the crap we've had over that, the rules have really been tightened up," 
said Tom Glass, 40, of High River, Alberta. "But some of the rules are good, 
like stove racks up inside the wagons. 
</P>
<P>
"We bang and crash a lot. You can take spokes out of each others' wagons. It's 
when the horses get involved that you don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
Dorchester said, "The judges lay it on you if you even touch anybody. If you 
bump a guy pretty hard, you get five seconds, which takes a lot of running to 
make up." 
</P>
<P>
The latest regulation is for drug testing -- for drivers as well as horses. 
</P>
<P>
"Geez," Dorchester said. "Most of us have never even seen a stick of marijuana. 
Most of us are old men." 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis, who lost an eye several years ago when a truck tire blew up in his 
face, said it's difficult to make it completely safe. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're runnin' a race, there's 32 head out there." 
</P>
<P>
The four outriders are responsible for loading the "camp gear" at the start and 
must then mount and finish within 125 feet of their wagons to avoid a time 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
It's wild and woolly but, Strandquist says, it's nothing like the old days. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to run with steel barrels. There used to be some real wrecks. We was 
in Red Deer one time when I hit a steel barrel and flipped 'er and broke my 
back. Tommy Dorchester (Dallas' father) flipped, too, and went to the hospital 
for a while." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Dorchester drove until he was 71. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel a guy should be doin' it at that age," his son said. 
</P>
<P>
But with the exception of Edgar Baptiste of Cando, Saskatchewan, Strandquist 
said, the current drivers are less skilled, especially in handling the teams 
around the barrels at the start. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't turn near as fast as they used to. Baptiste is out-turning 
everybody, but he'd just be an average guy 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They were better drivers then, by far. They were livin' with the horses. Lot 
of these guys never pick up a line except to come to a show. Same with the 
outriders. They're truck drivers, farmers." 
</P>
<P>
Glass is an exception. Several years ago he got into movies by providing stock 
and wagons, then started doing stunts and has worked as a double for actor Kirk 
Douglas several times. He also is a two-time Stampede winner and defending 
champion of the World Professional Chuckwagon Assn. 
</P>
<P>
His grandfather drove in the first Calgary races in '23, followed by his 
father, as Glass hopes he'll be followed by his son Jason -- the fourth 
generation -- in the '90 Stampede. "My dad taught me, like I'll teach Jason, to 
take care of the horses," Glass said. "You get what you give 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Glass hasn't been getting much, struggling through the Stampede in a 
season-long slump. 
</P>
<P>
But his status is such that the Calgary Herald, which publishes a daily special 
section on the Stampede, bid $30,000 to sponsor his rig and advertise on his 
canvas, same as Indy cars. That was second only to the $36,000 that Petro 
Canada paid for Kelly Sutherland. The Stampede promoters deduct 20% and the 
drivers keep the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The average sponsorships for the 36 entries this year were more than $21,000, 
almost double those of '88. In these parts, at least, chuckwagon racing is 
booming. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis is one of the most independent in a field of independent spirits. He 
might do better but declines to compete on either the WPCA or the National 
Professional Chuckwagon Assn. circuits -- preferring to race only at Calgary, 
on one of six special invitations extended apart from the automatic entries 
extended to the top 15 in the two associations. 
</P>
<P>
The problem started at Calgary in '82 when Lewis refused to kick back 10% of 
his winnings -- $2,000 -- to the WPCA because the WPCA wasn't sanctioning the 
event. He has remained suspended since, a fact that doesn't seem to bother him 
a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"When (the Stampede) quits givin' me an invitation, I'll quit drivin'," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Strandquist might never quit. His wife travels the circuit with him. "We got a 
little farm," he said. "But I'm gonna keep goin' for a few years, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why his original peers have all packed it in, Strandquist explained: "Old 
age."

NEWSWIRE: ARBITRATOR RULES HALL RELEASED BY BRAVES FOR SUB-PAR PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An arbitrator ruled Wednesday that the Atlanta Braves released outfielder 
Albert Hall because of his poor play, not because he admitted to having a drug 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Arbitrator George Nicolau, who heard the case last month, said: "Hall was 
properly released under (terms of) the uniform players' contract. The club's 
decision was made in good faith and was not improperly motivated and the 
commissioner's drug abuse program did not prohibit the club's action." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, 30, admitted to having a drug problem at the start of spring training. He 
completed a drug rehabilitation program March 22 and was released by the Braves 
six days later -- just before the deadline for releasing a player without 
having to pay his entire salary. 
</P>
<P>
The Major League Players Assn. filed a grievance, claiming that under the 
commissioner's policy, players who come forward and admit having drug problems 
may not be released. 
</P>
<P>
Hall had a .254 batting average, five home runs and 64 stolen bases in eight 
major league seasons.

JAGGER STONES THE NOSTALGIA TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mick Jagger says it's "boring" to celebrate a band's past -- and that's "the 
last thing" the Rolling Stones will be doing on its first U.S tour in eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview tied to the announcement Wednesday that the Stones will 
perform at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Oct. 21 with Guns N' Roses and 
Living Color, a frisky Jagger said he wouldn't have considered touring without 
some new music to play. 
</P>
<P>
Though Jagger didn't mention the Who by name, his comments seemed a slap at the 
Stones' longtime rock rivals, whose current farewell tour has a decidedly 
nostalgic aura. 
</P>
<P>
Where the Who's Pete Townshend refused to record a new album for the tour 
because he feels the band has long been what he calls "a spent force" 
creatively, the Stones will release a new album, "Steel Wheels," in connection 
with its two-month tour, which begins Aug. 31 in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what is important is that you have a new record and some new music 
that you really enjoy," Jagger, 46, said during a break in the Stones' 
rehearsal in Washington, Conn. "The last thing we wanted to do was a totally 
nostalgic exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to go out (under the banner) that said, 'You'd better see us 
now because this is the last time' or 'They are going to play their 25 years of 
rock' or something. That's not the push at all. I think it is boring to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously not going to just play the new album, but that's not unusual 
because all bands play the music from throughout their career. In fact, we'll 
probably only play about three songs on the early dates, until the music from 
the new album gets on the radio and fans get familiar with it. 
</P>
<P>
"But we don't just want to come on stage and say, 'Remember how good we used to 
be?' We want to show people what we can still do." 
</P>
<P>
At a Coliseum press conference Wednesday, Brian Murphy, president of Avalon 
Attractions, said tickets for the Oct. 21 stop will be $35, including a $4.50 
service charge. The seats, all reserved, will go on sale at 9 a.m. Saturday at 
Ticketmaster outlets in Music Plus stores throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Numbered wristbands will be given out from noon to 10 p.m. Friday at the 
Ticketmaster outlets -- with a lottery system used Saturday to determine which 
number gets the first tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets can also be purchased for $37, including a $6.50 service charge, plus a 
$2 per order handling charge, through Ticketmaster's phone lines, starting 9 
a.m. Saturday. There is a limit of eight tickets per person at both the stores 
and on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
These are Los Angeles' highest-priced stadium concert tickets ever, topping the 
$30 Michael Jackson shows in 1984 at Dodger Stadium. A survey of several local 
ticket agencies indicated that that the brokers' prices for choice Stones field 
seats could go as high as $400, while the cheapest tickets would be in the $50 
range. With approximately 72,000 seats available, a Coliseum sellout would mean 
a gross of nearly $2.2 million -- minus the service charge. Murphy, whose firm 
is producing the local show in association with Toronto-based Concert 
Productions International, said a second date may be added if the Oct. 21 
concert sells out quickly. The Stones gave two performances at the Coliseum and 
one at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium on its 1981 tour, but Avalon's Murphy said 
there will be no San Diego stop this time. 
</P>
<P>
The Who will be at the Coliseum on Aug. 26 for one of the three Southern 
California appearances on its tour. Approximately 10,000 of the original 72,000 
tickets -- priced at $25 plus $3.50 service -- remain available for the show. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Who will be at the 52,000-capacity Jack Murphy Stadium on Aug. 
22. Tickets are also available for that concert. The Who is also doing a 
star-studded, benefit performance of the rock opera "Tommy" on Aug. 24 at the 
6,251-seat Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
In the phone interview, Jagger said he never doubted the Stones would 
eventually tour again, despite his break from the band in recent years to do 
two solo albums and brief solo tours in Japan and Australia. Those moves were 
bitterly criticized by Stones guitarist Keith Richards, who followed with his 
own solo album and U.S. solo tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed very much the solo tour, especially Australia because there were 
more shows than in Japan and I got my teeth into it," Jagger said. "But I 
always thought we would do this tour this year. The only question I had was 
whether we could get the record done in time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great improvement over 'Dirty Work,' " Jagger added, comparing 
"Steel Wheels" (due in stores Aug. 29) to its 1986 predecessor. "That album had 
a couple of nice things in it but, on reflection, not a lot of depth. This one 
has a lot more variation musically and lyrically." 
</P>
<P>
Jagger said the band has rehearsed between 45 and 50 songs but is now 
concentrating on about 30 for the show, which he estimates will run about two 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"My attitude of that is you can't play a high-energy show for more than two 
hours," he said. "You can go three hours if you play a lower-energy show and 
take some rests and throw in a few long ballads. We're aiming for more energy 
this time, and two hours is about the max for that." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said the Coliseum is the only place Guns N' Roses -- the most celebrated 
new hard-rock band in years -- will appear with the Stones. Living Color is the 
only support act in most of the cities.

JACK VALENTI'S BALANCING ACT; 
</P>
<P>
MPAA'S CHIEF WALKS THE LINE AS STUDIOS EXPAND INTERESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Valenti learned the facts of life, Hollywood style, at his first meeting 
with Lew Wasserman, Arthur Krim, Jack Warner and other studio chiefs who hired 
him 23 years ago to advance their common interests as president of the Motion 
Picture Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh from Lyndon Johnson's White House, Valenti wanted to talk issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, Jack, let's cut through all this," Darryl Zanuck, then head of 20th 
Century Fox, told him instead. "Your biggest problem is the men around this 
table." 
</P>
<P>
More than two decades later, most of the faces have changed. But the chiefs 
around the table remain Jack Valenti's biggest problem. 
</P>
<P>
Not one known to back away from a fight, the 67-year-old Valenti has been 
struggling lately just to keep diverging interests and expanding egos from 
destroying the unity of his group, long known as one of Washington's most 
powerful trade associations. 
</P>
<P>
"There are obviously divisive issues . . . I hope the balance of the MPAA can 
be preserved. Unfortunately, I would not be surprised if it is not," said Barry 
Diller, chairman and chief executive officer of Fox Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps pointedly, officers of Warner Communications and Paramount 
Communications didn't jointly attend any strategy session of the eight-member 
MPAA -- which represents all the major movie studios -- while the two companies 
were locked in a bitter war over competing plans to combine with Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
With Time Warner's court victory over Paramount, the dust may have settled 
enough to permit a peaceful session when studio representatives meet again, 
probably in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Valenti will have to step carefully around some potentially volatile 
issues, most notably the studios' hitherto virulent opposition to increasing 
concentration of ownership in the cable-TV business. After all, newly formed 
Time Warner suddenly controls both the HBO program service and the nation's 
second-largest concentration of cable systems, covering about 12% of the U.S. 
market. That makes it tough for the MPAA to sustain its long-running attack on 
cable industry leader Tele-Communications Inc., which has an interest in cable 
systems covering roughly 25% of the U.S. subscriber base. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Fox Inc., with its expanding television interests, is starting to 
look a bit like some other old adversaries, the three established TV networks 
-- and that led to serious tension in MPAA ranks last year. 
</P>
<P>
When Fox applied to the Federal Communications Commission for a waiver of rules 
that subject it to regulation as a TV network when it starts distributing 15 
hours of programming a week to affiliates, sister companies like Paramount 
warned Fox that its waiver request would give ABC, NBC, and CBS an opening to 
attack FCC restrictions that keep them from owning and syndicating TV shows. 
Hamstrung, the MPAA took no official position on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were just coming into this job, frankly, I think it would be almost 
impossible," Valenti said of the balancing act that has been thrust upon him by 
the movie studios' rapid transformation into wide-ranging media empires, with 
potentially conflicting interests. 
</P>
<P>
(Valenti's formula for dealing with potential internal strife: "Wait a minute. 
Relax. Don't move. You've got to hunker down like a jackass in a hailstorm.") 
</P>
<P>
How long Valenti will choose to keep his job is the subject of increasing 
speculation. One Washington-to-Los Angeles rumor in recent weeks had it that 
former Democratic House Whip Tony Coelho, a friend of MCA chairman Lew 
Wasserman's, was about to take over the MPAA presidency. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Coelho said, "There is absolutely no truth (to the rumor)." 
</P>
<P>
Of the talk that he might step down, Valenti said: "If I could find something 
that offers this kind of fun, and also challenges me . . . yeah, I might 
consider it." An indefatigable globe-trotter, who spends his airborne hours 
working on a laptop IBM computer and reading serious works like a biography of 
Lord Byron, Valenti is currently writing his first novel, about politics, and 
considering another, about the movie business. 
</P>
<P>
The head of one major studio, who declined to be identified, said that 
increased pushing and shoving among his peers has posed a severe test of 
Valenti's endurance and political skills. "The members ought to treat Jack 
Valenti better," he said. "I wouldn't want to put up with those animals. Sooner 
or later, Jack's going to get tired of the craziness." 
</P>
<P>
By many accounts, Valenti's personal style has become a primary force in 
holding the MPAA together during an era when no single studio officer has been 
able to mobilize his competitors behind policy positions, as the 76-year-old 
Lew Wasserman often did when he was more active in industry affairs. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-'60s, Wasserman cultivated Valenti, then a presidential assistant to 
Lyndon Johnson, as a means of strengthening his access at the White House. As 
early as July, 1964, according to one letter in the Johnson presidential 
library in Austin, Tex., Wasserman was already offering Valenti the use of his 
Palm Springs home. The MCA chief became a primary force behind Valenti's MPAA 
appointment at a time when, according to one published report, the short list 
of candidates included defeated presidential candidate Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals familiar with the inner workings of the MPAA say that in today's 
configuration, Fox's Diller, Paramount's Frank Mancuso, MCA's Sidney Sheinberg, 
Warner's Bob Daly, and Disney's Rich Frank and Jeffrey Katzenberg all function 
as roughly equal "barons," generally leery of ceding leadership to one another, 
except in narrowly defined situations. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia and Orion have usually played a lesser role in the organization, 
possibly because the companies are focused more in New York than in Hollywood, 
while MGM/UA has drifted in and out while going through constant corporate 
restructurings. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1922, the MPAA has customarily not included the film industry's 
smaller companies, although some studios recently have suggested a move to 
solicit broader membership. (Many smaller distributors belong to the American 
Film Marketing Assn., which has been increasingly active with regard to global 
movie issues.) 
</P>
<P>
The MPAA members separately belong to the Motion Picture Export Assn., which 
deals with international issues, and the Alliance of Motion Picture and 
Television Producers, which conducts labor negotiations. Valenti is chairman of 
both groups, though he has left management of the alliance to its president, J. 
Nicholas Counter III. 
</P>
<P>
An adroit consensus-builder, Valenti has governed the MPAA under a "rule of 
two." Rather than depending on majority votes, and risking action on positions 
that a substantial minority might oppose, he has insisted that the association 
take no step to which any two members objected. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) introduced a bill that would have 
forced cable system operators to make their programming available to back-yard 
satellite-dish owners, a minority of studios -- Warner, Paramount and Disney -- 
opposed the measure, and prevented the association from taking a position to 
support it even if some favorable rumblings among the other companies had 
hardened into a majority. 
</P>
<P>
As various studios' corporate interests in cable, theater ownership, broadcast, 
and even print media continue to expand, such deadlocks may increasingly force 
the organization to avoid tough battles in favor of what are internally 
regarded as "motherhood" issues -- international trade restrictions, 
anti-piracy campaigns and the ratings system. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the MPAA will have a diminished role. But we may redefine it to 
things that remain common to the members," said Katzenberg, who is chairman of 
Walt Disney Studios. 
</P>
<P>
If internal differences do begin to hobble the MPAA, the studios will have 
squandered a network of political allegiances -- much of it based on personal 
loyalty to Valenti -- that has clearly been among the most effective in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in the top five" among lobbying groups, said Rep. Marty Russo 
(D-Ill.), who once prevailed on 35 members of the Ways and Means Committee to 
sign a letter to the Canadian prime minister warning of severe consequences if 
Canada enacted new restrictions on American films (Canada backed off). 
</P>
<P>
"They are strong. Jack Valenti has built great relationships. His word is 
good," said Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House's powerful 
energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations. 
</P>
<P>
One source of Valenti's clout on the Hill has been his ability to deliver not 
just well-attended screenings of yet-to-be-released movies at the MPAA's 
Washington headquarters, but also access to Hollywood's treasure trove of 
political money. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's own political action committee is relatively small, and 
reported just $57,142 in disbursements last year. But Valenti has often pointed 
congressmen toward the Hollywood circuit of lucrative fund-raisers like one 
this year at the home of Paramount chairman Frank Mancuso for Sen. Joseph R. 
Biden Jr. (D-Del). 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the heightened political interests of many stars and executives may 
actually be reducing Valenti's role as a money-broker. "When you have three 
Congressmen running out to Los Angeles in a week, we tend to lose control," 
explained one MPAA insider. 
</P>
<P>
So far, even the passing of Ronald Reagan's movie-rooted presidency has done 
little to diminish the studios' presence in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent European trip, for instance, George Bush sharply urged the 
European Economic Community to avoid contemplated quotas on American TV 
programming, and won a substantial delay in the matter. The quotas worked their 
way onto the presidential agenda after Valenti, a Texan who has known and 
worked closely with Bush for three decades, bumped into his old friend at a 
casual luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
"How are things in the movie business?" the President asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got problems," said Valenti, launching into the trade issue. 
</P>
<P>
Bush directed him to contact National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and U.S. 
Trade Representative Carla Hills, and the studios were soon dealing almost as 
comfortably at the White House as they had under Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Despite last year's internal skirmish over the Fox waiver request, which is 
still pending, the studios have so far remained united in their opposition to 
any change in the FCC's "financial interest and syndication" rule, which since 
the early 1970s has kept the big TV networks from owning a share in the 
programs they broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
But the expiration in November, 1990, of a consent decree that further limits 
the networks' ability to produce their own programs promises to test the 
studios' continued political muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the studios and networks toward a new compromise on the 
linked issues appear stalled, and studio representatives are bracing for a 
network assault in Congress and before the FCC on the financial interest rule 
by the time the consent decree expires. 
</P>
<P>
Studios argue that the networks will simply appropriate all their TV profits 
and drive small producers -- who are allied with the studios on this issue -- 
out of business if the barriers come down. The networks have argued that both 
the rule and the decree should be stripped away, to let them compete on an even 
footing with growing empires like Time Warner -- and to protect the future of 
free TV in an era when they have lost market share to cable and videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
NBC President Robert Wright and CBS President Laurence Tisch have been 
assiduously working to persuade Congress that financial interest is a potent 
consumer issue. "This is about the future of TV, whether network TV as we know 
it will survive," said Martin Franks, head of CBS's Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
The networks, out-maneuvered by Valenti in the past, are now taking a page from 
the studios' glamor-heavy political handbook. "We'll never be as political as 
Hollywood. But we've been fairly aggressive in using our sporting events, 
getting (politicians) up to New York, and showing people it's worthwhile to be 
friends with the networks," said one TV lobbyist, who declined to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the MPAA's most visible defeat in the Valenti years was its 
failure to block home taping of copyrighted programs, or to get a royalty 
placed on blank cassettes -- a fight that clearly got the studios on the losing 
end of a consumer issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Our adversaries were able to say, 'Mr. and Mrs. VCR, don't let them tax your 
tape. . . .' I will never again, ever, get involved with any kind of a public 
controversy where I don't have a consumer issue as part of my weaponry," said 
Valenti, who maintains that the true consumer interest in the financial 
interest controversy is diversity of program sources. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Valenti's hand appears strong in Congress on syndication and 
other issues, and it will probably stay that way, at least until some new 
complication develops among his members -- for instance, the purchase of a 
studio by a big foreign company. 
</P>
<P>
Australian-based News Corp. already owns Fox, but Rupert Murdoch, who controls 
News Corp., has become an American citizen. Fellow Australian Christopher 
Skase's Qintex Corp. has made a deal to acquire United Artists, but Kirk 
Kerkorian, MGM's major shareholder, will own a stake in Qintex and will 
distribute films through UA. 
</P>
<P>
But would it be harder to back the studios if one or more of the biggest 
players -- say, MCA or Columbia -- were owned by a Japanese parent? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it would. There's an emotional element, particularly in a controversy 
that involves U.S. firms," said Dingell, who represents a district in southern 
Michigan's automobile heartland. 
</P>
<P>
House judiciary committee chairman Jack Brooks, one of Valenti's strongest 
backers and oldest friends, seconds that opinion -- which may signal future 
MPAA headaches if Sony Corp. or some other high-profile foreign shopper finally 
decides to buy a movie company. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned about foreign ownership of communications and other economic 
entities in the U.S.," says Brooks. "They are not allowed to own TV stations. 
If they control satellites and TV companies, that may be almost as important 
and dangerous to the independence of the American people."

SCHOOL STILL ON FOR BOLSHOI'S YOUNG TROUPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The distance between the classroom and the stage has seldom seemed so profound 
as during the program Tuesday by the Bolshoi Ballet Academy at the Pantages 
Theatre, opening night of a seven-performance engagement. 
</P>
<P>
"Ecole de Ballet," a 1962 showpiece for the mighty parent company, suggested 
that Bolshoi artistry exists on a continuum: neophytes imperceptibly evolving 
into flamboyant professionals. No such luck. At the Pantages, we see student 
dancing that is mostly cautious and self-absorbed -- neat, prim and vacant, as 
in Marianna Ryzhkina's performance of a pas de deux by Maxim Martirosyan from 
"La Fille mal Gardee" opposite the likable, competent but quickly tired Yuri 
Klevtsov. 
</P>
<P>
Where's the bloom of genuine Bolshoi dancing, the joy, the individuality? 
Executing short pieces and excerpts to taped music, this appealing group of 16- 
to 24-year-old seniors and recent graduates of the Bolshoi Ballet School in 
Moscow looks grimly overtaxed, dutifully academic. Indeed, they come fully 
alive only in secondary assignments (a pas de six from Igor Uksusnikov's 
version of "Laurencia," for instance) and, especially, in two Ukrainian-style 
specialties: Zakharov's solo "Gopak" (rousingly performed by Alexei Musatov) 
and Pobezhimov's surging "Septet." Maybe the Pantages should have asked for the 
Moiseyev Academy instead. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday program began with the disastrously anti-academic Ekaterina 
Besergani faking her way through the ballerina role in a suite from Petipa's 
classical warhorse "Paquita." Breaking the rules, Besergani unleashed mile-high 
extensions that caused her placement to go out of whack, and jumps that lost 
their shape and steadiness in pursuit of sheer power. Even her gestural bravura 
often threw her off balance -- and she proved no more successful later on in 
the grieving platitudes of Martirosyan's duet "Consolation." Obviously, she has 
nerve, if nothing else, but why expose her in such unsuitable challenges? 
</P>
<P>
Alexei Malykhin partnered her capably both times, exuding the magnetic presence 
of a major dancer without ever doing anything remotely remarkable in his solos. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, stocky virtuoso Michael Shannon (a Los Angeles teen-ager who is 
currently the only American at the academy) came on strong in "Paquita," 
revealing a fine jump, excellent turns but also occasional lapses in 
terminations. Shannon may lack the distinctive personality and ideal line of 
Malykhin but he is at home in the air and, while that lasts, his future is 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission came nine miniatures, ranging from the familiar (Messerer's 
gymnastic duet "Spring Waters," roughly tackled by Elena Kotova and Vitali 
Yoganson) to the obscure (Usmanov's saccharine character trio "Spring," 
fervently interpreted by Natalia Bashkatova, Elina Melnichenko and Elena Utva). 
</P>
<P>
Although some of these divertissements evoked dancing-school recitals at their 
most deadly, two of them featured exciting gold-medal winners from the recent 
Moscow International Ballet Competition. Guest artists Galina Stepanyenko (of 
the Stanislavsky Ballet Theatre) and Vladimir Malakhov (of the Moscow Classical 
Ballet) are not ideally suited in either height or temperament, but their 
performance of Petipa's Black Swan pas de deux had the faultless authority 
audience have come to expect from Soviet dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Stepanyenko made a steely, imperious Odile, mistress of a spectacular jump and 
enough prowess in turns to embellish her fouettes and piques with pirouettes. 
Malakhov lifted her none too easily, but delivered elegantly stretched, smooth, 
speedy dancing in his solo and the coda. 
</P>
<P>
Malakhov also nearly redeemed "Narcissus," a ridiculous Goleizovsky solo that 
found him wearing a silver unitard with big appliqued stars over his heart and 
his right buttock. Between spasms of crude character definition, the 
choreography allowed him plenty of opportunities for sudden, magical ascents 
into turning combinations high off the floor: the evening's only indelible 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
And his curtain call held one more astonishment: The jump (illustrated in the 
Bolshoi Academy posters, souvenir programs and ads) in which his backbend is so 
extreme that he touches the top of his head with the heel of his foot. In the 
photograph, the leap looks heroic, but Malakhov made it look easy, even 
offhand, on Tuesday -- just another way of acknowledging applause. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of unstinting generosity used to be the great secret of Bolshoi 
dancing, but only a few of the Bolshoi Academy principals Tuesday understood it 
half so well. When they do, they'll move from the classroom to the stage with 
no trouble at all. 
</P>
<P>
The Bolshoi Ballet Academy continues at the Pantages through Sunday, with many 
changes of program and casting.

'MORAL RIGHTS' ISSUE PITS DIRECTORS GUILD AGAINST VALENTI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even while Jack Valenti wrestles to keep his studio chiefs in line, the 
emotional isssue of film colorization has driven a wedge between the Motion 
Picture Assn. of America and a group of traditional policy allies: Hollywood's 
movie directors. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, filmmakers are not part of Valenti's constituency. But on Capitol 
Hill, Valenti often has been perceived as the man who represented the entire 
movie business, not just the industry bosses. 
</P>
<P>
That's all changing. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti's vigorous legislative duels with the likes of Frank Capra, Steven 
Spielberg, even Jimmy Stewart -- first over attempted restrictions on 
colorizing black-and-white movies, more recently over the directors' push for 
"moral rights" legislation -- has elevated him to near pariah status among some 
activist directors and actors. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, Jack Valenti was an articulate, forceful, passionate speaker for 
what he labeled 'the industry,' " said director Elliot Silverstein. "But when 
the subject of film defacement and moral rights surfaced, it became clear that 
Jack was speaking solely for the business interests." 
</P>
<P>
Silverstein is leading the Directors Guild of America's efforts to secure 
"moral rights" legislation, giving directors the ability to sue production 
companies that substantially change their films after they are released. While 
moral rights legislation faces an uphill battle in Congress, opponents already 
are uniting for battle. They include such diverse interests as the MPAA and TV 
broadcasters, as well as publishers and record companies concerned about their 
artists obtaining similar rights. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between Valenti and prominent Hollywood directors began to 
deteriorate when the Directors Guild launched a lobbying effort in Congress to 
ban colorizing and substantially editing movies over the original filmmakers' 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until last fall that the directors began accusing Valenti of 
breaking his word -- a charge that Valenti has strenuously disputed. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the directors' allies in Congress introduced legislation to 
establish a National Film Preservation Board with the authority to designate 
any movie it desired as a "national treasure." The legislation was a 
watered-down version of the restrictions on colorization and other alterations 
that the directors really wanted. Under the measure, films that the board 
designated as "national treasures" would simply be required to carry prominent 
warning labels if they were substantially altered from the original version. 
</P>
<P>
The sponsors of the legislation surprised their opponents by circumventing the 
normal congressional channels and gathering sufficient support in two key 
committees. When it became clear that the MPAA would lose an important 
committee vote, Valenti sought a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's sponsors agreed to some changes, including limiting to 25 the number 
of films chosen as "treasures." In return, Valenti agreed not to lobby against 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Weeks later, though, he publicly attacked the legislation in a letter to 
several hundred industry figures. Asked about his agreement not to fight the 
bill, Valenti insisted that he was not "lobbying" against the measure in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti's relationship with the directors took another turn for the worse last 
month, when he publicly stated his refusal to participate in the voting of the 
National Film Preservation Board, even though he had been appointed as one of 
its 13 members. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert J. Mrazek (D-N.Y.), sponsor of the legislation establishing the 
board and a key ally of the directors, called on the MPAA president to resign 
"if he doesn't feel he can make a contribution" to the board. Mrazek hinted 
that some legislators may intervene if Valenti continues to refuse to take part 
in voting. 
</P>
<P>
But to Valenti, his refusal to participate is a matter of consistent 
philosophy. After two decades of fighting foreign-government involvement in the 
movie business, Valenti said, he's not about to take part in a "government body 
making a movie list of any kind." And nothing, he firmly insisted, is going to 
change his mind.

OWNERS OF TROUBLED BELL CASINO OK $8-MILLION SALE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After years of financial and legal troubles, owners of the California Bell Club 
have agreed to sell their card club to a Los Angeles investors group for $8 
million, a casino partner said. 
</P>
<P>
The Moraga Investment Group signed an agreement in May to purchase the club, 
Samuel Torosian, casino partner and general manager, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Bell officials say the sale, if approved, may help Bell recoup delinquent taxes 
and re-establish the casino as a source of much-needed income. 
</P>
<P>
The city has only $50,000 in reserve funds to handle emergencies, and the 
preliminary budget for the next fiscal year calls for $500,000 in cuts, 
including elimination of five positions, said City Administrator John Bramble. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Club Owes $1.9 Million 
</P>
<P>
The club, which at one point generated revenues of nearly $2 million a year for 
the city before competing clubs began to lure away customers, owes the city 
$1.9 million in unpaid taxes, Bramble said. 
</P>
<P>
The city had started condemnation proceedings in 1987 in an effort to take over 
the club and regain back taxes. The effort, which would have made Bell the 
first city in the country to own a gambling institution, was abandoned June 5. 
</P>
<P>
The sale must be approved by a federal bankruptcy judge. The casino's owners in 
April filed for reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws. Judge Kathleen 
March is scheduled to rule in September on the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the sale would be used to pay more than $7 million in debts, 
including more than $3 million in federal, state and city taxes, according to 
court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Henry S. Stone is listed in court documents as president 
of Moraga Investment Group. He could not be reached for comment about the 
casino purchase. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Moraga executives initially expressed interest in managing 
the card club for the city if it had taken control through eminent domain 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"The Moraga group came to us first," said City Atty. Robert Flandrick. "But 
they felt they could make a better deal directly with the club, which is fine 
because we were trying to be a catalyst to get a new operator anyway." 
</P>
<P>
City officials had negotiated with several management groups to take over 
day-to-day operations of the casino, but negotiations generally stalled over 
the $7.1 million needed to pay off creditors, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Bramble said only one deal came close to being completed. Earlier this year, 
California Casino Properties Inc. signed an agreement, and Bell officials 
prepared to sell bonds to pay off the creditors and partners. The card club's 
gross receipts would have been used to pay off the bonds, according to the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But California Casino Properties called off the deal in March. "It certainly 
was frustrating," Flandrick said. "We had filed for condemnation proceedings 
and we got a buyer, but they changed their minds." 
</P>
<P>
In late May, Moraga and California Bell signed a preliminary purchase 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Bell then decided to scrap its eminent domain plans early in June, Bramble 
said. The city's condemnation effort had cost $125,000 to $130,000 in legal 
fees, he added. 
</P>
<P>
When the 560-seat card club first opened in 1980, city officials said it poured 
nearly $2 million in annual tax revenues and fees into Bell city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Customers Left 
</P>
<P>
But as other casinos sprang up in the neighboring cities of Huntington Park, 
Commerce and Bell Gardens, many customers left the Bell club. Profits shrank, 
tax revenues dried up and the city of Bell experienced a sharp budget crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the casino also has been plagued by legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, law enforcement authorities raided the club and homes of the 
general partners in an investigation of alleged illegal activities, including 
skimming of profits. Two months ago, Wing Lou, one of the four casino partners, 
was charged with grand theft for allegedly writing $162,000 in club checks to 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1985 profit-skimming scandal, two city officials pleaded guilty to 
conspiring to form a secret partnership with poker club investors. 
</P>
<P>
City officials now are looking to new owners to restore the club to financial 
solvency. 
</P>
<P>
If the bankruptcy court approves the sale, Moraga will still need to pass a 
Bell city review to qualify for a business license, City Administrator Bramble 
said. But a preliminary background check has determined that the group appears 
to have the financial resources to purchase the club, he added.

TROUBLE-PLAGUED ROCK BALLROOM'S LICENSE REVOKED 
</P>

<P>
Acting on complaints of noise, littering and drug use and drug sales, the City 
Council has voted unanimously to revoke the business license of Fender's 
International Grand Ballroom, which showcases heavy metal and punk bands on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Department of Financial Management recommended the action. A 
department report said the owner of the downtown nightspot, John Fender, failed 
to comply with repeated requests from the city to halt rowdiness allegedly 
caused by patrons. 
</P>
<P>
The council also revoked licenses for two party rooms and Player's Sports Bar, 
a bar and grill that Fender owns on the same block. The ballroom is at 521 E. 
1st St. 
</P>
<P>
"This man has stomped on his neighbors; he's raised havoc," Councilman Wallace 
Edgerton said. "If he would have been in my district, I would have shut him 
down a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents complain that they have been harassed by patrons loitering in 
the area and littering. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, rock fans outside Fender's skirmished with Long Beach police who had 
cut off further access to a concert in an overcrowded room. 
</P>
<P>
Fender has contended that patrons have not caused all of the problems. "We're 
in downtown Long Beach and have only one show a week, while the area's got 
problems seven days a week," he said last month in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Fender left the hearing Monday saying: "It isn't over yet." 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, M. Lawrence Lallande, said he plans to seek a Superior Court 
order to force the City Council to schedule another hearing for Fender. 
</P>
<P>
Lallande said Fender has been preoccupied by a five-week criminal trial that 
concluded Monday, when a jury convicted Fender of helping steal more than 
$141,000 from Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank in 1987. He had been accused of 
conspiring with a bank teller to cover his overdrafts with bogus deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Fender, who is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 22, faces a prison term of up to 
five years. He has been freed on $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Lallande had urged the City Council to postpone action on the license 
revocations, but City Council members said Fender had been given enough time to 
prepare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bent Over Backwards' 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ray Grabinski said the council had "bent over backwards" to ensure 
that Fender received due process. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, whose district includes Fender's property, 
also said Fender had been given enough opportunity to solve the problems 
attributed to patrons. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Lallande said the decision shows that "Long Beach, at least 
with this council, is not prepared to step into the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors applauded the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I would submit that our neighborhood has been in a living hell for the past 
five years," said Scott Hunt, 28, who owns a condominium in the area. "We can't 
tolerate much more of this." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, representing an informal group of neighbors, told the council that as 
recently as last weekend, police were called to Fender's to break up fighting 
in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock 'n' roll has never been an issue," Hunt said. "It's been the way the man 
runs the operation. Sometimes it sounds like bands are in my living room."

BARRICADES AT BIXBY PARK WIN SUPPORT

Bixby Park, long a pickup spot for gay men, will be padlocked at night under a 
city plan intended to stop chronic cruising and prostitution that has disrupted 
nearby residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this week endorsed a proposal to close the park at 10 p.m., 
two hours earlier than it now does, and barricade the two cross streets running 
through the park, 1st and 2nd streets, with locked gates to keep out cars. 
Police will also enforce an anti-cruising ordinance prohibiting drivers from 
passing back and forth in front of the same point more than twice in a 
four-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is the product of months of work by two neighborhood groups and one of 
the city's leading gay and lesbian organizations, the Long Beach Lambda 
Democratic Club. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with what has been proposed," said Lynne Severns of Beach 
Area Concerned Citizens, noting that the nighttime problems of noise, 
prostitution and drug trafficking have grown worse in recent years, greatly 
annoying residents of surrounding blocks. 
</P>
<P>
"The closing is not to punish anybody. It is to start changing the attraction 
of the park," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Listed in Gay Travel Guide 
</P>
<P>
A green expanse that covers three blocks just north of Ocean Boulevard, Bixby 
Park is known as a place where gay men can go to pick up other gay men or a 
male prostitute. It is even listed in a gay travel guide as a cruising spot. 
</P>
<P>
In response to neighborhood complaints, police have increased their park 
patrols in recent months, and the number of citations and arrests in the park 
have risen dramatically. Although members of the gay community had previously 
complained that police used the park problem as an excuse to harass them, 
recent police activity has raised no serious objections. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can change the reputation of the park . . . we'll need fewer police," 
said Rick Rosen of Lambda's police relations committee. 
</P>
<P>
While Rosen said he personally wishes the park could remain open until 
midnight, he said his organization endorses the proposal. The plan must go 
before the city staff for review before the council takes final action on it. 
</P>
<P>
Sidewalks bordering the park would remain open all night.

A NEW POLICY FOR MOTHERS IN PRISON MAY HELP TEAR DOWN IMPOSING BARRIERS TO 
RAISING A CHILD 
</P>

If you asked Jenny Martinez, "Have you hugged your kid today?" she'd laugh you 
right out of the room. Even though she's the mother of three, with another on 
the way, the room is a cell at the Ventura County Honor Farm in Ojai, where the 
bumper-sticker question is just an ironic joke. 
</P>
<P>
Hugging their kids is not something most women in jail are allowed to do. 
Traditionally, the policy has been "look but don't touch," and it is enforced 
in most facilities throughout the state by a physical separation: screens, 
glass or fencing. At Ojai, one visiting room is equipped with Plexiglas and 
another with a wood partition, depending on the prisoner's potential for 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
Not only will Martinez tell you that she has not hugged her children today or 
yesterday or last month, she will tell you that under the circumstances, she 
does not want to see them, even for the 30-minute visitations allowed once 
every two weeks. "The visits aren't good," she said. "If I can't touch them and 
hold them, I'd rather not see them at all." 
</P>
<P>
Pauline Rivas, a former cellmate who was released in late July, seconds that 
emotion. A mother of three children ranging in age from nine months to four 
years, the 21-year-old Rivas said: "It's very hard. What do you say to little 
ones that they'll understand? They don't understand why you can't hold them. 
It's just too hard." 
</P>
<P>
State and local corrections officials hope a recently approved program will 
ease such concerns and help break the cycle of addiction and crime that lands 
the women in jail to begin with. The program -- called Teaching and Loving Kids 
(TALK) -- is designed to help incarcerated mothers more constructively relate 
to their children. It tears down the partitions between mothers and children, 
expands visiting time to 90 minutes and offers a supervised array of activities 
more reminiscent of playtime than of hard time. 
</P>
<P>
At the handful of other California jails and prisons using the TALK program, 
activity areas are set up with a variety of blocks, easels, drawing and 
chalkboards, clay, dolls, beads for stringing and snapping and play areas for 
dress-up and tea parties. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers are instructed not just to watch, but to play, not to ask 
value-judgment questions ("Are you being good? Are you doing well in school?") 
and, of course, to hug. 
</P>
<P>
Such a session concludes with a group game called "parachute," in which the 
children grab the edges of a large circle of fabric, lift it in the air while 
their mothers run underneath, and then bring it down, covering the inmates. 
Then the situation reverses: The mothers do the lifting while the children lie 
giggling under the big parachute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liked by Inmates 
</P>
<P>
TALK was popular with inmates when it was first offered as a pilot program in 
1987 at the Mira Loma women's facility in Los Angeles County. Ventura County 
officials also have high hopes for it. They are waiting for the arrival of 
specially equipped trailers in October to start it. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you right now, our inmate mothers will love it," said Sgt. Kelli 
McIlvain, a supervisor at the Ojai facility, where perhaps 80% of the 190 
female inmates are mothers. "It could make a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Corrections spokesman Mike Van Winkle said 85 of 105 
inmates who participated in the department's prison-mother-infant program in 
1987 were successful -- success being defined as good behavior with no rule 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't yet look at a success rate after they have been paroled. It's too 
soon and the sample size is very small. But we expect success because we choose 
people for the program who can benefit most and who can meet the criteria," Van 
Winkle said. "We have a waiting list of prisoner-mothers waiting to get into 
this program. It helps keep them on the straight and narrow. Is there a bigger 
incentive for a mother than her children?" 
</P>
<P>
To many inmates, the answer is not so obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a vicious circle," said the diminutive and soft-spoken Rivas, who was 
jailed for heroin use. "That drug comes first and your priority is taking care 
of yourself. It's very selfish." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, whose fourth child is due in September, said matter-of-factly: "Let's 
be realistic -- our kids do not come first. We do not do what we're supposed to 
do. I don't play the part with the crying stuff and how bad I feel for my kids 
because I know I'll be right back." 
</P>
<P>
The children of Martinez, who also was jailed for drug violations, and Rivas 
are being cared for by family members who have been awarded temporary custody 
by the county's Public Social Services Agency. But having their children 
removed permanently is always a possibility. "If you don't have family support, 
you're a goner," said one inmate. 
</P>
<P>
While inmate mothers retain the right to arrange for their children's care, 
courts can place the children into permanent foster care if the mothers are 
ruled unfit. And even the most skeptical inmates admit that if anything can 
scare them straight, it is the prospect of losing their children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reason for Living 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared, I'm real scared," whispered Rivas. "I don't want to mess up 
again." Although Rivas' mother cared for her children while she was jailed, she 
knows that can change if she is arrested again. And there may come a time when 
her mother is not considered physically able to care for three children. "They 
take your kids away, then tell you to get a job, and that's supposed to be your 
reason for living?" 
</P>
<P>
To some, more legitimate reasons for living exist behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
At least for awhile, the women are sober and drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
As Jenny Martinez observed: "We come in here like the walking dead, and we come 
out looking great, brand new! Sometimes I think the police don't arrest us, 
they rescue us." 
</P>
<P>
They go to substance-abuse workshops; they are tutored by a group of volunteer 
retired teachers called Roots and Wings. They work in the fields tending crops. 
</P>
<P>
And, after an average stay of 90 days, they get out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 in 10 
</P>
<P>
Then, said Martinez, it's the same old story. "Maybe one of every ten get off 
this wheel," she said. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvain, an 18-year Sheriff's Department veteran, agreed with Martinez's 
gloomy assesment. McIlvain said she sees the same faces year after year -- 
women who got involved with drugs and alcohol early on and dropped out of 
school, with no skills or money. More often than not, they ended up involved in 
petty crimes to support themselves and their addictions. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it becomes a pattern, a cycle, that few seem to be able to break out of," 
McIlvain said. "If we can provide any impetus for these women with a program 
like TALK, we want to do it."

NORTHEAST AREA ADDED TO L.A.'S RECYCLING NET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Trash recycling bins are being distributed this week to about 15,000 homes in 
several northeast neighborhoods of Los Angeles as part of a citywide expansion 
of voluntary recycling. 
</P>
<P>
The distinctive yellow containers, some with 12-gallon and some with 14-gallon 
capacities, are being left at curbs by the Los Angeles Conservation Corps along 
with booklets explaining the recycling program. Special recycling trucks will 
begin weekly pickup one week after the containers are delivered. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, recycling pickups will be on a day other than regular trash 
pickup days, said Gyl Elliott, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Bureau of 
Sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
Residents included in the program will be asked to put aluminum and steel cans, 
glass bottles and jars and clear plastic soda bottles into the containers, then 
leave them, along with loose or bundled newspapers, at curb side on the 
recycling pickup day. 
</P>
<P>
The recycling containers are being distributed on a staggered schedule to large 
portions of Atwater, Highland Park, Eagle Rock, Mount Washington and Silver 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The program, called Recycle L.A. Phase Two, will nearly double the number of 
households involved in voluntary recycling, bringing the total to 90,000 
distributed through all 15 Los Angeles City Council districts, Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
Other curb-side recycling areas, the earliest begun in 1985, now include about 
45,000 households in Westside and San Fernando Valley neighborhoods. The 
materials collected at those houses are sold to several recycling firms, 
holding the overall cost of the collection to from 90 cents to $1.20 per house 
each month, Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those earlier programs called upon residents to separate different 
kinds of recyclable refuse into three containers. However, the Bureau of 
Sanitation decided to move ahead with single-container recycling because it 
proved easier on residents, Elliott said. Voluntary cooperation with recycling 
has generally run from 30% to 50%, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The new recycling areas being opened this week are expected to cost more, as 
much as $3.66 per household each month, because of the complex logistics, 
Elliott said. The cost would be expected to fall as the program grows. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott said the new pilot areas will help the bureau answer key questions such 
as how the market for recyclable refuse will sustain greater supply and what 
types of vehicles and containers work best. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau will use the knowledge as the basis to propose mandatory recycling 
for all 720,000 households in the city, Elliott said. A recommendation for 
mandatory recycling will be presented to the Los Angeles City Council within a 
month, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The council has directed the bureau to initiate recycling as a way to reduce 
the volume of trash rapidly filling the city's landfill capacity.

GLENDALE TO CONSIDER LIMITS ON BEHEMOTH HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to complaints about what some residents are calling the 
"mansionization" of Glendale, Mayor Jerold Milner said Tuesday that he will 
recommend imposing size caps on single family homes at an upcoming City Council 
study session. 
</P>
<P>
Milner's comment came in the wake of a controversy over a 7,150-square-foot 
home under construction at 1621 Vista Drive, which residents claim will ruin 
the neighborhood's character. 
</P>
<P>
The study session, at which the council will consider zoning restrictions in 
single family neighborhoods, is scheduled Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the trend toward tearing down existing homes and building 
massive houses that nearly fill the lot has grown in several Los Angeles County 
communities, particularly affluent Westside neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills City Council last year adopted an ordinance limiting the size 
of houses to 55% of the lot's size. Pacific Palisades adopted a similar 
ordinance in April, and the Los Angeles Planning Commission is studying a 
proposal to reduce height limits on single family homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raggio Reluctant 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Carl Raggio said he "hated passing ordinances" and would vote for 
one only if it is determined that the Vista Drive project is not an isolated 
incident but part of a citywide trend. 
</P>
<P>
"That house is clearly out of line for the type of neighborhood it is in, and I 
would hope that other developers have more sense than that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some 20 members of the newly formed Northwestern Glendale Homeowners Assn. 
attended last week's council meeting to complain about the Vista Drive project. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Carter, the association's president, said the new house will be out of 
character in a neighborhood of medium and small houses, and that he was 
concerned about a trend toward "mansionization." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Public Works Director George Miller told council members that the 
Vista Drive project did not violate zoning rules, since there are no size 
limitations in single family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The project, Miller said, met the setback requirements, which stipulate the 
minimum distance between the building's exterior and the adjacent street and 
property lines. 
</P>
<P>
Following Miller's report, Milner said he would like to see floor area 
restrictions, a method for controlling building size used in apartment zones, 
extended to single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The floor area ratio measures the relation of floor space in a building to the 
area of its lot.

COURT REJECTS EFFORT TO ALTER BOUNDARY OF STATE COASTAL ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A California Court of Appeal has rejected a legal challenge to the state 
coastal zone boundary that, if successful, would have exempted a large area of 
the Santa Monica Mountains from tough development controls. 
</P>
<P>
In a 31-page ruling, the appellate court upheld the dismissal last year of a 
lawsuit that sought to invalidate the coastal boundary on grounds that state 
Coastal Commission staff drew it farther inland than lawmakers intended. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was cheered by a homeowners coalition that intervened in the 
original lawsuit on the Coastal Commission's side. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most spectacular areas in this part of the state, and I'm 
glad it won't be left to the tender mercies of Los Angeles County," David 
Brown, vice president of the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation, said after the 
decision was handed down late last week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good News' 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Damm, director of the commission's south coast district that includes Los 
Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties, called the ruling "good news, because 
our job is to protect . . . the resources within the coastal zone, and 
specifically within the Santa Monica Mountains." 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Stacey, lawyer for one of the landowners who brought the challenge, 
maintained that lawmakers never meant to "take properties in for coastal zone 
regulation" that are as far from the coast as those of his client. Stacey said 
no decision has been made on whether to appeal to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal zoning places more restrictions than local zoning on development, 
limiting grading, visual impact and disturbance of vegetation and wildlife 
habitat. The boundary realignment sought by the lawsuit would have removed 
hundreds of parcels and thousands of acres of land in the Santa Monicas from 
the coastal zone. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was language in the 1976 Coastal Act defining the coastal zone as 
"that land and water area" on Coastal Commission maps, and went on to describe 
how the maps should be drawn. In environmentally sensitive areas such as the 
Santa Monicas, the zone was to extend inland "to the first major ridgeline 
parallel to the sea, or five miles from the mean high tide line of the sea, 
whichever is less." 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the suit maintained, the staff hoodwinked lawmakers who did not 
review final versions of the maps before approving the Coastal Act. 
</P>
<P>
In defending the current boundary, the commission maintained that the "first 
major ridge" should be defined as the ridge that creates a watershed -- not 
merely the first topographic uplift inland from the coast, as the suit 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by the 2nd District Court of Appeal, dated July 26, upheld last 
year's decision by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel, who rejected 
the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"The plain language of the statute does not support the contention the 
topographic standard is superior to the maps," the appellate court said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suit Filed in 1987 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the court noted, legislation twice was introduced to change the maps, 
but lawmakers did not see fit to pass it. 
</P>
<P>
"This history shows the Legislature twice has had the opportunity to set the 
coastal zone boundary at the first topographic elevation, but has chosen to 
leave it as placed in the map," the court said. "It is reasonable to infer the 
Legislature based its failure to modify the boundary, at least in part, on the 
commission's view that the watershed is the critical ridgeline, not the first 
topographic elevation." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed in 1987 by Rossco Holdings Inc. and Michel T. Ghosn, who 
own three properties in Calabasas near Malibu Creek State Park that are three 
to five miles from the beach. The Coastal Commission has approved housing 
developments on all three tracts but has allowed fewer lots than the owners 
sought and imposed other restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Rossco, owned by Beverly Hills attorney-businessman Leonard M. Ross, has 
approval for 22 lots on its 102-acre Piuma tract on Piuma Road and was allowed 
up to 34 lots on its 272-acre Quaker tract on Mulholland Highway in the Las 
Virgenes Valley. The commission approved 23 house lots on Ghosn's 160-acre 
tract. None of the tracts have been developed.

WHITTIER SCHOOLS RACES TAKE SHAPE

<P>
With eight days left before the Aug. 11 filing deadline, 19 candidates, 
including six incumbents, are seeking election to seats on six Whittier-area 
school boards this November. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest contests are expected in districts where the hottest issues have 
developed. The Whittier City and Whittier Union High school districts have been 
racked by debates and controversies and have drawn the largest number of 
candidates for the Nov. 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
Seven candidates, all newcomers, were vying for three seats on the Whittier 
City School District board by Tuesday afternoon. And five candidates, including 
two incumbents, were competing for three seats on the Whittier Union High 
School District board. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Avery, superintendent of the Whittier City School District, an elementary 
and intermediate school district with 5,900 pupils, said he was surprised at 
the number of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time in years we've had this many people running," Avery said. 
One reason, he suggested, is that at least two of the three incumbents on the 
district board have decided not to run. "Normally, it's the incumbents and one 
other person running." 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the board and district teachers disagreed on a number of issues, 
including terms of a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier Union High School District has also seen its share of problems. 
</P>
<P>
A $1.8-million accounting error by Los Angeles County forced school officials 
to cut several programs and positions, then appeal for state relief. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems Far From Solved 
</P>
<P>
On July 20, the Legislature ordered the money to be paid back to the district 
with state funds. 
</P>
<P>
But the problems are far from solved, said Supt. Lee Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
"We're facing dramatic decreases in enrollment and the financial consequences 
that come with it," Eastwood said. "Over the past 20 months, we've had to cut 
$3.5 million out of our budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Our financial problems have been an albatross around our necks for the last 
couple of years. Now we're into the bone." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the districts without controversy are off to a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
No one has signed up to run in the East Whittier School District election, 
where four board seats are vacant. And only a handful of people have expressed 
an interest in running in the Los Nietos and South Whittier school district 
elections, said Marcia Ventura of the county registrar-recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Fagan, superintendent of the East Whittier School District, the largest 
elementary and intermediate school district in the area, said candidates have 
traditionally filed their papers on deadline day. 
</P>

"It's characteristic of this district," Fagan said. "People will file at the 
last minute. They always do." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura said one person has signed up to run in the South Whittier School 
District election, and two incumbents have filed to run in the Los Nietos 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
"From my perspective, this is going to be a quiet election," said Bill Brown, 
director of instructional services for the Los Nietos district. "There's really 
no burning issues. That seems to be what draws candidates."

Ronald Randolph, superintendent of the Lowell Joint School District, said he 
expects the race in his district to be low-key. Four candidates, including 
three incumbents, are competing for three seats.

THEATER IN THE PARK BRINGS CLASSICS UP TO DATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elizabethan morality, Greek tragedy and French and English comedy are coming to 
a Culver City park this month during the city's outdoor festival of classical 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
The Theater in the Park series at Paul Carlson Park kicks off this weekend with 
"Dr. Faustus," Christopher Marlowe's 16th-Century tale of a scholar who sells 
his soul to the devil. Subsequent weekends will see Euripides' "Alcestis," 
Moliere's farce, "The Imaginary Invalid," and Francis Beaumont's comic "Knight 
of the Burning Pestle." 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the city's Human Services Department, the free festival began 
three years ago when Anne Laskey, a Westside director, approached Culver City 
with a proposal to stage classical plays. She chose Culver City because she had 
previously acted in a city-sponsored play at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium 
and because "being a small city, there's not a lot of bureaucracy and red tape 
to go through." 
</P>
<P>
The city this year is donating $600 and rehearsal space in two recreation 
centers and paying for printing, postage and lumber for the productions, Laskey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
35 Actors 
</P>
<P>
Auditions, advertised in local newspapers and on flyers posted at colleges and 
libraries, were held in early July. The 35 actors selected, who are not paid 
and who fill about 55 different roles among the four plays, have been 
rehearsing furiously ever since, said Laskey, artistic director and co-producer 
of the series. 
</P>
<P>
In real life, the actors range in age from 10 to about 50, and include actual 
actors, as well as writers, waitresses, accountants, clerks and a pastor, 
Laskey said. Most of them are Westside residents. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Israelson of Culver City, at 5 feet, 10 inches tall, will try to persuade 
audiences that she's George the Dwarf in "Knight of the Burning Pestle." She 
waitresses in Santa Monica and has had jobs as an extra in movies and 
commercials. Having acted in Theater in the Park before, she says she enjoys 
performing in the "wide open space" of the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Frank Ramirez, who plays a psychiatrist in the festival's modernized 
version of "Alcestis," a quack doctor in "Invalid" and a merchant in "Knight," 
sometimes has had to juggle two different rehearsals per night. "It gets 
confusing to keep track" when he has to switch from slapstick comedy to Greek 
tragedy in one evening, he says. "I have to ask, 'Who am I right now?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father-Son Act 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, a theater-arts major in college who continued working on plays during 
his seminary studies, says this is his first acting role in seven years. A 
Shakespeare fan, he attends Oregon's Shakespeare festival in Ashland every 
year. The love of Elizabethan theater, he says, has rubbed off on his 
10-year-old son, who also landed roles in "Knight." 
</P>
<P>
The congregation at Ladera Church of the Brethren in Ladera Heights is amused 
with their pastor-actor, Ramirez says. He considers the acting, along with 
running and free-lance writing, another activity that "takes me totally away 
from the ministry" and "keeps me from burning out or doing something like Oral 
Roberts or Tammy Bakker." 
</P>
<P>
The festival, Laskey says, aims to bring theater to "some people who aren't 
used to seeing theater" and to win over those who, with a groan, remember 
plodding through Shakespeare and Sophocles in high school English classes. 
</P>
<P>
To spice them up, "Alcestis" and "The Imaginary Invalid" will be thrust forward 
in time to the present, Laskey said. In "Alcestis," written in 438 BC, a king's 
wife volunteers to die for him, and Heracles battles Death to rescue her. 
Shifted to 1989 Beverly Hills, "the king is a major studio executive, the wife 
would be the starlet who'd give up her career to have his children, and Death 
would be a typical high-powered drug dealer," Laskey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modern Plot Twists 
</P>
<P>
In "The Imaginary Invalid," about a hypochondriac who tries to marry his 
daughter into a family of doctors, Paris of the 1600s becomes Los Angeles of 
today. The daughter wants to wed a young rock 'n' roll music teacher "who 
speaks in Valley talk," said stage manager Diana Utech. The father's choice, "a 
real nerd of a doctor," is called a "dweeb," said Utech, who is also a 
department store saleswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Classics can be "funny, moving, bawdy," Laskey says, describing "Knight," 
written in 1607, as "on the level of the Three Stooges go Elizabethan." In the 
play, a grocer and his wife interrupt a play and insist on substituting its 
scenes and lines with their own and casting their assistant, Ralph, as the 
leading man. Ralph is cast as a Don Quixote-type knight who tries to save 
damsels in distress; meanwhile, the real actors try valiantly to continue their 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Laskey and co-producer Richard Stone chose the plays based on their length and 
whether they could be whittled down to an hour's playing time. Another factor 
was whether they could be pulled off in a park. That meant complicated sets, 
costumes, lighting and atmosphere were out, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Very quiet plays don't work, because (in the park) there are wild parrots that 
screech, ice cream trucks, kids having birthday parties. So you need something 
that doesn't rely on a lot of mood." 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Faustus" will be presented Saturday and Sunday; "Alcestis" on Aug. 12 and 
13; "The Imaginary Invalid" on Aug. 19 and 20; and "Knight of the Burning 
Pestle" on Aug. 26 and 27. All performances start at 2 p.m. at Paul Carlson 
Park, at Motor Avenue and Braddock Drive.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: D.A. FILES 2ND MURDER CHARGE AGAINST DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has filed a second murder 
charge against accused drunk driver Harry Bouboushian after the second of his 
seven passengers died over the weekend from injuries sustained in a single-car 
accident July 16. 
</P>
<P>
Bouboushian, who had been scheduled Tuesday to face his preliminary hearing on 
the original charges, instead was arraigned on additional second-degree murder 
and vehicular manslaughter charges involving the death of Arthur Bezekian, 14. 
Bezekian, who had been unconscious since the accident, had been on a 
life-support system at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffery Oscodar said prosecution and defense attorneys 
agreed to a postponement of the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony of witnesses who are due to leave the country later this month will 
be taken today and Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Bouboushian, 34, had been charged with one count each of second-degree murder, 
vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, hit-and-run and two counts of felony 
drunk driving at his July 19 arraignment. He has pleaded not guilty to both the 
original and the new charges. 
</P>
<P>
All charges stem from an accident that took place shortly before 11 p.m. July 
16. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Bouboushian was driving westbound on Los Feliz Boulevard at speeds 
exceeding 100 m.p.h. when he lost control of the car just west of Vermont 
Avenue and crashed into a light standard. The car became airborne and struck 
two parked cars, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Armine Karapetian, Bouboushian's wife, died at the scene. Bezekian was one of 
four passengers who were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Bouboushian, an Inglewood auto body shop owner with two previous drunk-driving 
convictions, had completed a court-ordered drunk-driving treatment program just 
three days before the accident and had six outstanding speeding tickets, one 
for driving in excess of 100 m.p.h.

abuse and gang membership. Activities will include SWAT, K-9, paramedics and 
Fire Department vehicle rescues. 
</P>
<P>
The day camps are one segment of a multifaceted assault on drugs and gang 
violence, according to an announcement from Mayor Ernie Kell. Others include 
the expansion of the DARE program, gang awareness training in schools and an 
anti-graffiti program. 
</P>
<P>
The one-week camps will be run at parks in high-crime areas where gangs have 
been identified and drug trafficking is heavy.

THREE FROM VALLEY AMONG THE TOP 100 PREP SENIOR GRIDDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three football players from the San Gabriel Valley are listed among the top 100 
high school seniors by the Sporting News: wide receiver Jeremy Smith from 
Bishop Amat in La Puente, tight end Elic Mahone of Muir in Pasadena and running 
back Marshawn Thompson from Bassett of La Puente. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 6-feet and 175 pounds, was an All-CIF Southern Section and Los Angeles 
Times All-San Gabriel Valley first-team selection as a junior when he caught 82 
passes for 1,000 yards and nine touchdowns to lead his team to the Division I 
finals. He returned two punts for touchdowns and scored another rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 6-1 and 190, was an All-Southern Section and Times All-San Gabriel 
Valley second-team choice as a junior after rushing for 1,717 yards and 16 
touchdowns in 301 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Mahone, 6-5 and 228, was a solid blocker and pass catcher for Muir last season 
with 23 receptions for 325 yards and three touchdowns and also excelled on the 
defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Two sprinters from Duarte High School will compete in the first Jack in the Box 
Invitational track and field meet at 3:45 p.m. Sunday at UCLA's Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Phetima Woods and Jeanine Stewart will run in the girls high school 100-meter 
dash. They are expected to receive their toughest competition from sprint 
sensation Angela Burnham from Rio Mesa in Oxnard, who won the 100 and 200 
meters at the CIF state finals in June. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Los Angeles men's track team has signed three junior college 
transfers to letters of intent for next season: 
</P>
<P>
Richard Doering from Riverside City College in the javelin, Raul Hernandez of 
L.A. Trade Tech in the 5,000- and 10,000-meter runs and Brian McCleery from 
Saddleback in the high jump. All will be juniors next season. 
</P>
<P>
McCleery, who attended Weber State University in Utah as a freshman before 
transferring to Saddleback for his sophomore season, cleared 7-2 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Doering finished first in the javelin with a throw of 221-6 at the state 
community college championships in leading Riverside to the team title. 
Hernandez finished third in 10,000 meters at the same meet. 
</P>
<P>
Two families from Covina will compete in the finals of the Avco Family Bowling 
Tournament on Aug. 11-13 in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Gibboney and her stepfather, Dennis Ferren, will compete in the prep 
division for ages 11 and younger and Wendy Lesley and her mother, Bonnie, are 
entered in the junior division for ages 12 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
The teams qualified for the national event by winning divisions in state 
tournament play. Winners in the national competition will receive up to $5,000 
in college scholarship funds. Gibboney and Lesley have already won a $500 
college scholarship.

DEARTH OF SITES SNAGS NEW-SCHOOL PLANS; 
</P>
<P>
FINDING OPEN LAND IN CROWDED NEIGHBORHOODS A 'NIGHTMARE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Los Angeles Unified School District needed a new high school in 
Granada Hills in the late 1960s, finding space was no problem. John F. Kennedy 
High School was built on 28 acres of vacant land in the middle of a new housing 
development. Few people, if any, objected to having a high school in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the good old days. In Los Angeles and other big cities, finding 
space for new schools in increasingly crowded neighborhoods has become a huge 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nightmare" trying to find suitable sites for new schools, said Los 
Angeles Board of Education member Roberta Weintraub, who chairs the board's 
building committee. "You look around and realize that no matter what you do, 
it's either too expensive or there are too many people living there or it's not 
in the right place." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s and 1960s, the district "pretty well had (its) pick of property," 
said Robert J. Niccum, the district's real estate director. "We were buying 
orange groves and strawberry fields (for schools). . . . Now, the closest thing 
we can find to a strawberry field is a hotel." 
</P>
<P>
Niccum was referring to the district's recent announcement that it wants to buy 
the old Ambassador Hotel, demolish it and build a new 2,000-student high school 
to serve the mid-Wilshire area. The plan has preservationists, local business 
interests and politicians up in arms. 
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador episode is the latest in what has become an increasingly 
controversial issue. The district stopped building schools for most of the 
1970s and 1980s. Now, in a feverish attempt to catch up, it plans to build 19 
elementary, three junior high and six high schools. Thirty-nine campuses are in 
need of expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, nearly every week the school board hears from angry residents who oppose 
having their neighborhoods razed to make way for schools. And, in other cases, 
the issue is not homes but toxic hazards, as illustrated in the district's 
recent decision to study the contaminated site of a former ceramics plant in 
Atwater as the location for a high school. 
</P>
<P>
To many, the problem of finding space for schools is a metaphor for the 
changing nature of Southern California. In contrast to the 1950s and 1960s, 
when population growth was occurring mostly in outlying suburban areas, now the 
boom is in the inner city. Along the Wilshire and Olympic corridors, in 
South-Central and downtown Los Angeles, and in the southeast Los Angeles County 
communities of South Gate and Bell, where the Los Angeles district operates 
schools, factors such as immigration, a climbing birthrate and redevelopment 
pressures have placed heavy and sometimes conflicting demands on the use of 
precious urban land. 
</P>
<P>
For the school district, the dilemma is that it needs new schools most in those 
areas of the city where open land is least available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Model May Not Be Practical 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some say the archetypal Southern California school, with spacious 
playgrounds and low-rise classroom buildings sprawled over acres of land, no 
longer is a practical model. 
</P>
<P>
"In Southern California, we are simply accustomed to doing everything in 
suburban form, but life is changing," said Wayne Ratkovich, head of Wilshire 
Stakeholders, a property owners group that would like the Ambassador site to be 
developed mainly for housing and commercial uses. A school in that area "ought 
to look more like a New York school than an Orange County school." 
</P>
<P>
But, says school board President Jackie Goldberg, who represents the area that 
includes the hotel, building schools New York-style makes little sense in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're talking about is just the California life style," she said. "In New 
York, kids are not hanging around outdoors a lot because of the weather. In 
California, being outdoors, particularly in our mild winters, is an advantage. 
There's a lot of Vitamin D (from the sun) and exercise and involvement in 
athletic activities which does keep some kids in school." 
</P>
<P>
New York City schools long have made do with less land than California school 
districts are accustomed to having. Most New York classroom buildings are at 
least four stories. Only half of the city's 116 high schools have any kind of 
athletic field -- a situation that would be considered anathema in sunny 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles district, enrollment swelled in elementary schools by 52,448 
students and in junior and senior high schools by 14,417 students over the past 
decade. Including continuation and other special schools, the district has 
nearly 595,000 pupils. Projections show that figure may grow by 7,000 to 10,000 
students in the coming school year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Year-Round Schools 
</P>
<P>
To cope with the surging numbers, the district has created more than 100 
year-round schools, which handle up to 50% more students by using classrooms 
through the summer. The district calculates that without year-round schools, 
nearly 34,000 students would not have a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The district also buses thousands of students from overcrowded campuses to ones 
with more space. During the last school year, 20,750 were bused, 5,000 more 
than the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics such as these have forced the district not only to consider unusual 
sites but to approach school design more creatively. 
</P>
<P>
A new elementary school in South-Central Los Angeles, for example, will be 
built on city land at Gilbert Lindsay Park and use the park as a playground, 
Niccum said. Similar arrangements have been made with the cities of Cudahy and 
Bell, where the district operates schools. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, three new elementary schools were opened, Montara Avenue and 
Teresa Hughes in South Gate and Pio Pico near Koreatown. Construction of a 
magnet high school in East Los Angeles is slated to be completed by this fall. 
</P>
<P>
They are the first schools to be built since Kennedy High opened in 1971. No 
schools were constructed during the 1970s and the early 1980s largely because 
of Proposition 13, which limited the ability of school districts to raise 
construction money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Opposition 
</P>
<P>
In the years since, schools, particularly high schools, have not been welcomed 
in many neighborhoods. Haberdasher George Harb, whose store is directly across 
the street from the Ambassador, said that although he supports education, a 
high school on the hotel site would bring "crime, drugs, graffiti and extra 
traffic -- you don't have to be a brain surgeon to see that." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of the district's building program say it takes the homes of 
people who can least afford to move elsewhere. The district has bought about 
2,000 homes and apartments in the last five years, Niccum said. Residents in 
another 1,300 dwelling units have been notified that their homes may be taken. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a real affordable-housing crisis in this city," said the Rev. Philip 
J. Lance, a spokesman for United Neighbors of Temple Beaudry. The group is 
fighting to preserve about 100 homes in a low-income neighborhood just north of 
downtown where the district wants to put a new junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials consider the Ambassador Hotel, which closed its doors 
last January, an almost ideal site because it poses no major environmental 
risks, does not involve the loss of homes and is located in the middle of an 
area packed with teen-agers. Officials say they are prepared to use the process 
of eminent domain -- the legal right of school districts and other public 
agencies to require the sale of private property for public use -- to acquire 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
But because it occupies 23 acres of prime mid-Wilshire real estate, the hotel 
property also is coveted by local community interests as the centerpiece of 
redevelopment plans for the rebounding Wilshire Corridor. They want the school 
district to scale back its plans -- use only five or six acres, perhaps near a 
public park -- or find an alternative site. 
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador sits at the heart of the mid-Wilshire strip, which had been in 
decline for the last decade. Wilshire Stakeholders envisions a 
residential-commercial development on the property that would serve as a magnet 
to new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Ratkovich, who has been responsible for renovating historic buildings 
such as the Wiltern Theater on Wilshire Boulevard, said the school district has 
been grossly insensitive to "the importance of . . . (the Ambassador site) to 
the surrounding community." 
</P>
<P>
"There just aren't sites like this in the middle of cities any more, much less 
on a city's main boulevard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SCHOOL DISTRICT BUILDING PLAN 
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, the Los Angeles Unified School District plans to 
build 29 new schools and expand 39 existing campuses. This table shows the 
location of the construction projects by high school attendance areas. Only 10 
sites have actually been purchased for the projects.

Mobil Oil Corp. has acknowledged publicly for the first time that its Torrance 
refinery is responsible for part of a huge plume of gasoline-tainted ground 
water that stretches at least three-fourths of a mile from its plant, and has 
agreed to participate in a cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Mobil, which has spent $3 million over three years to define 
the problem, said the company could not estimate how high the cost will climb 
or how many years the cleanup will take. 
</P>
<P>
The oil company -- already pumping nearly pure gasoline from atop the water 
table beneath the refinery -- has also agreed to install a barrier of wells to 
block the flow of contaminated water from its property, the company confirmed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accepts Responsibility 
</P>
<P>
The company accepted responsibility for part of the pollution in recent letters 
to the city and a state regulatory agency, although it has yet to find the 
specific source of the gasoline among its many tanks and pipes. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil now believes that gasoline leaks at its tank farm in eastern Torrance not 
only deposited 2.4 million gallons of fuel into shallow ground-water pockets 
and a regional aquifer but also spread dissolved hydrocarbons southeast of the 
refinery, spokesman Greg Munakata said. 
</P>
<P>
The pollution poses no threat of explosion and has been found only in water 
basins not used for drinking in the Torrance area, he said. Mobil has tested 
drinking water aquifers beneath the contaminated basins and found no pollution, 
Munakata said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, test wells show that a toxic plume up to 1,000 feet wide stretches 
at least 4,000 feet from the tank farm at Van Ness Avenue and Del Amo Boulevard 
south to Torrance Boulevard. The plume underlies the city's largest 
redevelopment project, the $200-million American Honda Motor Co. national 
headquarters now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil accepts responsibility for the northern 500 feet of the plume. And, 
Munakata said, if more tests "tell us that we have a greater responsibility, 
then we'll accept it." 
</P>
<P>
Munakata said Mobil expects the Regional Water Quality Control Board to 
eventually conclude that several other companies share responsibility for the 
contamination, which consists mostly of highly toxic chemicals found in 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Sources Discovered 
</P>
<P>
But state water engineers and city officials said they think Mobil is 
responsible for nearly all of the plume, even though two other sources of the 
pollution have also been discovered in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert said Mobil's position is hardly a large step 
forward. In fact, she said, the city is looking at its legal options because of 
the slowness of Mobil's response. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a recognition of what appears to be the obvious," she said. "None of this 
has moved at the rate expected." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance filed suit against the refinery in April in an attempt to have it 
declared a public nuisance and subject to city regulation. The city maintains 
that the refinery's use of deadly hydrofluoric acid and its history of fires, 
explosions and illegal air emissions justify city intervention. Mobil has 
countersued, saying that the refinery is safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Four Years of Tests 
</P>
<P>
Mobil's acknowledgement of responsibility for part of the plume comes more than 
four years after the regional water board directed Mobil and 14 other 
refineries in Los Angeles County to conduct tests to determine the extent of 
ground-water pollution under their facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the water board's chief refinery engineer, Jim Ross, said water 
pollution at Mobil had led to "the largest off-site migration" of any of the 
refineries. The board then ordered Mobil to pump gasoline from beneath its 
refinery and to come up with a comprehensive plan for cleaning up the plume by 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"There had been some concern that Mobil wasn't owning up to the problems that 
were being detected off-site," Ross said. "I wouldn't say they're rushing to 
achieve the fastest possible cleanup. But to say they aren't cooperating is 
totally inaccurate." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Councilman Dan Walker, also a member of the regional water board and a 
vocal critic of the refinery, said he has been assured by state engineers that 
"things are proceeding in a satisfactory manner, and I have to place my 
reliance on them." 
</P>
<P>
Ross said Mobil's proposal to build a wall of wells to pump and clean 
contaminated water at the border of the refinery answers the state's greatest 
concern at this point -- the migration of gasoline to the plume. "Once they've 
accomplished this, then it makes sense to go after the off-site cleanup," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Munakata said Mobil plans to begin drilling the barrier wells this fall and to 
complete the project next June. Meanwhile, it will also continue testing of 
tanks and pipelines to try to pinpoint the source of the leaks. Tests over the 
last two years have detected only two dime-sized holes in two tanks, he said, 
probably not enough to account for the seepage. 
</P>
<P>
It will also drill many new wells to confirm its contention that other 
companies, including a now-defunct plating company, share in the blame. "We 
know there's gasoline contamination in that plume," Munakata said. "We also 
know there is contamination of industrial solvents that the refinery hasn't 
used and are not present in the northern portion of that plume. And we know 
there are other sources of gasoline contained in the southern portion of that 
plume." 
</P>
<P>
Test wells have found levels of benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, thousands 
of times higher than the state standard for drinking water in the plume. High 
levels of other toxic chemicals, including toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene, 
have also been found.

BEE LINE A LONELY ONE; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY'S LONE INSPECTOR ON ALERT FOR KILLER VARIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something was falling from the sky, and the people in Rolling Hills Estates 
didn't know what to think. Tiny yellowish brown drops splattered cars, houses, 
people. Birds weren't the problem -- that much they could tell. They looked up 
and saw airliners. Jet fuel, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
Calls were placed last week to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
but the smog police knew better. This was a case, they said, for Mike Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Pearson is a man who knows bee poop when he sees it. He is the one and 
only bee inspector in the Los Angeles County agricultural commissioner's office 
-- a lonely, obscure and potentially dangerous task that the public takes for 
granted. Even in summer, when such 
</P>
<P>
hymenoptera (stinging insects) as honey bees, yellow jackets, wasps, hornets 
and bumblebees are at their nastiest, people seldom stop and think, gee, I 
wonder how the county bee inspector is doing today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
His Stature May Rise 
</P>
<P>
But soon, Pearson's stature may rise. If predictions come true, the 
mild-mannered bee inspector will be very much in demand, perhaps even a media 
darling, a film-at-11 kind of star, for he is the man who would stop the killer 
bees. 
</P>
<P>
"They're coming," Pearson said from behind the net slung over his pith helmet 
the other day. It is not a matter of if, he said. The Africanized bees -- 
Pearson prefers their proper name -- have in three decades traveled from South 
Africa to South America to Mexico. Colonies are expected to arrive in 
California sometime in 1991. Your back yard, perhaps. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A dozen regular old domestic bees buzzed about Pearson's head. "When they do 
come," he said, "there will be clouds of them around me." 
</P>
<P>
The bee-sting death of a 65-year-old farm worker in Fresno County who drove her 
truck Monday into a set of hives set off alarms among bee inspectors and 
beekeepers that perhaps the Africanized bees had arrived. Tests later showed 
that domestic honeybees had stung her an extraordinary 136 times. Unlike most 
bee-sting deaths, the victim apparently had no allergic reaction, but succumbed 
to the sheer volume of venom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear Mass Attacks 
</P>
<P>
When Africanized bees arrive, more of these sorts of mass attacks are feared. 
Their venom is no more potent than that of the domestic honey bee; the danger 
is their hostility -- that something much less than a truck collision will stir 
their malevolence. 
</P>
<P>
Frequent, sensational mention of killer bees in supermarket tabloids -- 
alongside the usual Elvis sightings -- has perhaps confused the facts about 
Africanized bees. "There's been a lot of hype," Pearson said. 
</P>
<P>
But then, their true story is like bad science fiction, beginning with the work 
of a certain geneticist in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
As reported in science journals, a geneticist brought African bees to Brazil in 
the 1950s, hoping to breed better honey producers than the indigenous variety, 
an earlier import from Europe. But the African bees -- more hostile than the 
European variety -- genetically overwhelmed, or "Africanized" their 
counterparts. The Africanized bees escaped into the wild and earned the 
nickname "killer" for swarming, sometimes fatal attacks on animals and humans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started as Student 
</P>
<P>
Pearson, who developed a fascination for bees while he was a student at Cal 
Poly Pomona, became the county's bee inspector in 1981. He figures that he has 
been stung about 100 times, including one incident in which he took 15 stings. 
He developed a fever, but was soon back among the bees. 
</P>
<P>
He branched into the killer variety in 1985, when bee inspectors from 
throughout the state were mobilized after a pocket of Africanized bees had been 
discovered in an oil field in Lost Hills, near Bakersfield. A dead fox, rabbit 
and raven were found near their hive. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the Africanized bees had hitched a ride from South America on a 
shipment of oil-drilling equipment. The successful eradication effort -- 14 
separate colonies were identified and fumigated with no injuries to humans -- 
makes Pearson optimistic about California's ability to deal with killer bees. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent symposium on the Africanized bee menace in San Diego, Pearson said, 
it was reported that up to 100 human deaths per year have been attributed to 
the bees in Venezuela alone. But Venezuelans, in some cases, attempted to 
capture the bees without wearing protective clothing or using proper equipment. 
Ignorance was the problem, Pearson suggested. "They're not really killers 
unless they're provoked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uses Scented Traps 
</P>
<P>
Since the Lost Hills episode, Pearson's killer bee vigil has consisted of 
checking 13 scented traps set at strategic locations around the county -- the 
port, major truck routes, an oil field in Signal Hill. So far -- Pearson is a 
little embarrassed to admit it -- these traps haven't even caught a stray 
domestic colony. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the effort is considered so important that the county Board of 
Supervisors -- after cutting funding for mental health -- recently backed away 
from a proposal to cut funds for the Africanized bee detection effort. No 
politician, apparently, wants to seem pro-killer bee. 
</P>
<P>
When they come, Pearson said, his duties will change radically. He envisions a 
task force of bee inspectors who roam the county, responding to reports of 
suspicious bee activity. The first detection, he said, will probably be in a 
hobbyists' back-yard hive. Killer bees are known to attack and take over other 
hives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They send out raiding parties and they'll just fight their way in. Their queen 
will search out the other queen and kill her. A coup d'etat. . . . After a 
time, they're all Africanized." 
</P>
<P>
It could happen to any one of the more than 30,000 domestic hives registered in 
the county, both commercial operations and those of hobbyists. Eighty of those 
hives -- perhaps 250,000 individual honeybees -- can be found in Marvin 
Griffin's back yard in Rancho Palos Verdes. It was Griffin's colonies, the bee 
inspector determined, that were fouling a certain neighborhood in nearby 
Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Regulations 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes, it turns out, has no ordinance to regulate beekeeping. 
Officials there say they are attempting to abate the nuisance as an illegal 
commercial enterprise in a residential zone. But Griffin says that won't be 
necessary; he is now looking to move his hives to three more rural locations in 
Los Angeles and Kern counties. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin, 46, who started his bee hobby 14 months ago with a single hive, is now 
an avid breeder and a trapper of wild colonies. He hopes to breed an extra-mild 
bee, he said, to contend with Africanized gene pools. "I love bees," he said. 
"It's like I finally found my niche in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The beekeeper, after being contacted by Pearson, said he was "flabbergasted" 
when he saw the mess his bees were making. One driveway was so dotted, he said, 
it looked like a test for color blindness. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hobby," he said, "that went a little wild."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACUPUNCTURE FIGURE PLEADS NO CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former state Acupuncture Examining Committee member Chae Woo Lew has pleaded no 
contest to conspiracy charges in a far-reaching scheme to sell answers to the 
state licensing exam for acupuncturists, district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi 
Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
So far 24 acupuncturists in Los Angeles have pleaded guilty in the scandal. 
Another 20 await disposition in their cases. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the no contest pleas entered Tuesday, prosecutors are likely to 
drop 56 bribery charges filed against Lew, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
Lew, of San Mateo, could be sent to prison for four years when he is sentenced 
Oct. 27. He was charged in February with bribery, conspiracy to commit bribery 
and conspiracy to dissuade a witness. Prosecutors contended that Lew, 53, was 
paid at least $500,000 to rig the state licensing exam from 1982 until 1988.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUSH TO ATTEND CITIZENSHIP RITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush will participate at an outdoor naturalization ceremony for 3,500 
new U.S. citizens at East Los Angeles College stadium on Sept. 16, Mexican 
Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said the President agreed to 
appear in East Los Angeles after it was learned that virtually all of the 
prospective citizens are of Mexican descent. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, organizers of the annual Mexican Independence Day parade in East Los 
Angeles have moved the event up a day from Sunday, Sept. 17, in an attempt to 
persuade the President to ride in the parade after the ceremony. The White 
House so far has been silent on whether he might appear. 
</P>
<P>
The events are part of the observance of Mexico's revolt for independence from 
Spain, which was ignited by a shout of freedom -- El Grito -- by a priest, 
Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, in 1810.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GABOR WINS ACCESS TO OFFICER'S FILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beverly Hills Police Department was ordered Wednesday to turn over to Zsa 
Zsa Gabor any misconduct complaints in the personnel file of the officer who 
arrested her after a traffic stop confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Charles G. Rubin issued the order releasing paper work on 
Officer Paul Kramer, variously described by Gabor as an "empty-headed, gorgeous 
man" and a "sadist." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer arrested Gabor June 14 in her Rolls-Royce Corniche after he pulled her 
over for a registration violation. She drove off and, after the officer got her 
to stop two blocks later, she allegedly slapped him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor faces misdemeanor charges of committing a battery on a police officer, 
disobeying a police officer's orders, driving with an expired license, having 
an open container of alcohol in her car and carrying an expired registration. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor's attorneys contend the officer has a history of harassment against 
celebrities and that Gabor was only using self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
The pretrial hearing Wednesday before Rubin lacked the glitz of Gabor's 
arraignment last month, when she arrived in a silver limousine. Gabor did not 
attend this hearing. Her trial was scheduled for Sept. 11.

PEGGY BUCKEY'S COMMENT IN ELEVATOR SNARLS MAN'S MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bizarre development involving two lengthy and sensational trials in 
neighboring courtrooms, jurors two weeks into deliberations in the case of 
accused murderer Harvey Rader were told to start all over again Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The action was taken because of remarks made by McMartin molestation case 
defendant Peggy Buckey in an elevator Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Juror Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
A Rader juror, who overheard Buckey discussing the case, was dismissed by Los 
Angeles Superior Court Judge Lorna Parnell -- who ruled that the panelist had 
been "contaminated" by what she heard -- and replaced by an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
The same juror had been the subject of an earlier hearing, after the jury 
foreman complained that she was refusing to participate in deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, who with her son, Ray, is charged with molestation and conspiracy 
involving 11 children who attended the family run Manhattan Beach nursery 
school, told the agitated judge that she had said nothing more than that she 
felt "very sorry" for the family of one of the alleged murder victims she had 
come to know during trial recesses. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart goes out to them for what they're going through," she quoted herself 
as saying to a friend, lawyer Charles Lindner, when the juror -- the only other 
person in the elevator -- identified herself as a panelist, stopping the 
conversation. Lindner, not the juror, immediately reported the incident to 
Parnell. 
</P>
<P>
The juror, under questioning by Parnell on Tuesday, said she was not paying 
attention, until she heard Buckey say something like "Sol went to England," an 
apparent reference to Sol Salomon, who disappeared with his wife and two 
children in October, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The remark could be construed as lending credence to the defense, since the 
Salomons' bodies have never been found. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies Making Statement 
</P>
<P>
Buckey on Wednesday denied saying anything about England, adding that she did 
not even know who "Sol" was. 
</P>
<P>
Rader, whose trial began in March, could face the death penalty if convicted. 
He is also a suspect in the 1982 disappearance of a Granada Hills couple and a 
Burbank man. Defense attorney Mark Lessem said he fears the switch in jurors 
could hurt his client's chances for acquittal and indicated to reporters that 
Buckey's comments may not have been accidental. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the juror was being thrown off the panel, McMartin defendant 
Raymond Buckey was testifying in the courtroom next door about "pyramid power," 
as the judge, jury, and even one defense attorney tried to stifle laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey said he kept a large pyramid over his bed, because he believed it helped 
him sleep. He added that he had a collection of smaller pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
He explained that, from what he had read, pyramids "supposedly have a positive 
effect on living things. All I know is I experimented with it and it worked." 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Buckey testified on cross-examination that in 1982 he attended 
a convention on nutrition and unidentified flying objects in Reno, where he 
helped a friend sell pyramid-shaped hats. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, he and a woman he met at the convention went to Lake Tahoe 
and to Pyramid Lake, where they were baptized naked, he told Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Lael Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
The ritual, which Buckey said was "a spur of the moment thing," was performed 
by a man described by Buckey as "supposedly a wandering minstrel" the woman 
knew and by the prosecution as "a silver miner who claimed to be a minister." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wearing Pyramid Hat 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said outside the presence of the jury that Buckey had been seen 
driving around Los Angeles wearing a pyramid hat in early 1984, while under 
surveillance by a district attorney's investigator. 
</P>
<P>
The defense argued, unsuccessfully, that Buckey's experiences with "pyramid 
power," an ancient concept repopularized in the 1960s, are irrelevant to the 
molestation issues at hand. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders said the defendant's 
dabbling in the fringe movement -- taken together with previous testimony about 
his drinking, use of marijuana and other problems -- "tends to discredit" 
defense contentions that his mother would not risk the reputation of the 
30-year-old McMartin school by hiring an unfit teacher, even her son. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders indicated that Buckey's conduct was not consistent with being a 
pre-school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pounders said in ruling that the prosecution could explore 
Buckey's use of pyramids, the defendant's participation in activities that many 
might view as bizarre "tends to refute" the defense position that Buckey's 
alleged involvement in satanic-like rituals at a Hermosa Beach church testified 
to by one child are too bizarre to be believed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not that far off," the judge said of the pyramids.

CONTROVERSY OVER BUSING OF CUDAHY PUPILS RESOLVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL and ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents angered over the busing of students from a school in Cudahy, where a 
tar-like seepage had forced a shutdown of the campus, announced Wednesday night 
an agreement with district officials whereby the children will attend classes 
closer to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The parents had objected to a Los Angeles Unified School District decision last 
month to send the children from Park Avenue Elementary School to a 
South-Central Los Angeles school seven miles away, where the parents feared 
gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, announced in Cudahy City Park on Wednesday night by 
George Perez, head of the parents group, the students will continue to be bused 
to Russell Elementary School until September, when the regular school year 
begins. Then the students will move to classes in temporary bungalows and spare 
classrooms at Elizabeth School and Theresa Hughes School in Cudahy. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said he was "very happy" with the agreement, but he said long-term 
problems, such as possible classroom crowding, still have to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Delgado, a representative for school board member Leticia Quezada, and 
Maria Casillas, superintendent for Region B, which includes Park Avenue School, 
confirmed that the agreement had been hammered out by the parents and Casillas 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's wonderful," Casillas said. "I think it's a good solution." 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Leonard Britton issued the order closing the year-round school after the 
Environmental Protection Agency took samples of the ooze. A preliminary study 
by independent consultant Angelo Bellomo indicated that the substance is a 
"complex mixture of hydrocarbons . . . highly acidic, like battery acid." 
</P>
<P>
Last December, a study by Thorne Environmental Inc. of Anaheim showed the 
seepage contained methylene chloride and phenathrene, potential carcinogens; 
methylnapthalene, which can cause headaches and mental confusion, and pyrene 
and benzopyrene, both carcinogenic and toxic. 
</P>
<P>
Both reports indicated that the only danger to the students would come from 
eating the ooze, breathing the vapors if it were burned or having prolonged 
skin contact. 
</P>
<P>
The school is built on an old landfill, and officials believe the seepage is 
from refuse and petroleum products dumped years ago.

INS AIDE FAULTS CRITICAL REPORT ON REFORM LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service Wednesday disputed 
findings of a new Orange County report that alleges immigration reform law has 
had a negative impact in the county. 
</P>
<P>
John Belluardo, director of congressional and public affairs for the western 
region of the INS, predicted that the new report will likely be used as a tool 
to "further the agenda of those who want the agency to cease its law 
enforcement activities." 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy from people who are anti-INS," 
Belluardo said. He acknowledged that he had only read news accounts of the 
report and had not seen the actual document, which was released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The report -- the first comprehensive local assessment of the Immigration 
Reform and Control Act of 1986 -- was sponsored by the Orange County Human 
Relations Commission and the Hispanic Development Council. 
</P>
<P>
Among its major findings are that immigration reform has not stemmed the flow 
of illegal aliens into the county and that the undocumented community will 
continue to grow. 
</P>
<P>
The report also contends that immigration reform has created a new class of 
exploited workers and that INS "sweeps," or raids to round up undocumented 
workers, have alienated the immigrant community. 
</P>
<P>
Belluardo said that while immigration reform has not completely eliminated the 
problem, the numbers of illegal immigrants who attempt to cross U.S borders has 
been greatly reduced. 
</P>
<P>
He also said there is broad community support for INS sweeps and referred to 
opponents of the raids as a "small group of activists" who are adept at 
publicizing their cause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Defended 
</P>
<P>
Lilia Powell, vice chairwoman of the Hispanic Development Council, defended the 
report's conclusions and said they were not intended as a critique of the INS. 
</P>
<P>
Powell also said that the contents of the report -- the outgrowth of testimony 
taken at a public hearing on immigration reform last November -- reflects a 
broad range of community opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"When he uses the word activist, he is talking about everyone who testified at 
that hearing -- service providers, community leaders, public officials and even 
a chief of police," Powell said. "Not all of that testimony was negative or 
griping about problems. . . . I would hope that he would come in with an open 
mind and look at the report as a good read." 
</P>
<P>
Powell said copies of the report will be sent to community groups, school and 
health officials, public agencies and area representatives with the hope that 
it will provide better understanding and fairer implementation of immigration 
reform law.

NEIGHBORS BATTLE PAIR SEEKING TO BUILD HOME FOR RECOVERING ADDICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Costa Mesa developer Bob Ward and his son, Dee, say they want to give something 
back. 
</P>
<P>
The Wards, both recovering alcoholics, want to build a 24-bed halfway house in 
the College Park neighborhood of Costa Mesa that would offer round-the-clock 
treatment for those who need help getting off the bottle or kicking their drug 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
But area residents, who already complain about an existing six-bed halfway 
house for alcoholics on the site, say they will oppose the Wards' plan when it 
comes before the city Planning Commission Aug. 14 because they fear an even 
larger facility would attract drunks and homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all very upset about this," Wake Forest Road resident Jemma Jones said 
Wednesday of Ward Investment Co.'s plans to raze the house in the 300 block of 
West Wilson Street and build a new, two-story facility to be called Harbor 
House. The existing house borders Wilson Park on one side and Harbor Shopping 
Center on Harbor Boulevard on the other. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cause for Concern' 
</P>
<P>
"To have our piece of mind jeopardized is certainly a cause for concern," Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The impending fight over the planned, 36,000-square-foot facility, to some 
extent, mirrors that of residents living near the Rea Community Center about 10 
blocks away. There, residents earlier this summer successfully fought a poverty 
relief agency in their midst. After emotional public hearings, the City Council 
voted not to renew the lease of Share Our Selves, which for years has provided 
food, vouchers for lodging and some medical assistance to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of College Park, Jones and other residents claim that the expanded 
Harbor House would add to traffic and increase the number of homeless people 
who camp out in nearby Wilson Park. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, residents say they have gathered more than 500 
signatures on petitions against Harbor House that they plan to present to 
planning commissioners Aug. 14. The commission will be considering a 
conditional-use permit to allow multiple-family zoning in the area. If 
approved, residents can appeal the permit to the City Council, which would then 
make a final determination. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in my life I've been in a fight," said resident Alice 
Beck, who lives three doors from the site. "I just wish I knew how to fight 
better." 
</P>
<P>
But Dee Ward sees it differently. In one of several letters to homeowners 
announcing the proposal, he said the center would be a role model for those 
with nowhere else to go. And the prohibitive cost, from $1,000 to $4,000 a 
month, would keep out vagrants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Made the Scapegoat' 
</P>
<P>
"This project is not going to attract homeless people, winos, bag ladies and 
transients," 30-year-old Dee Ward said Wednesday. "When they pay so much money, 
they're not coming there to sip wine. I was made the scapegoat for the problems 
of the park." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ward, who, like his son, required treatment at the Betty Ford Center in 
Palm Desert, hopes residents will see that the proposed project is beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
"If they could only open their eyes to what they're fussing about," said Bob 
Ward, 58. "When my mother died, she had never seen me sober. I have a lot of 
giving back to do." 
</P>
<P>
Dee Ward said the project is expected to cost about $800,000. When finished, 
Harbor House would provide a home for 24 recovering alcoholics or drug addicts 
ranging in age from 18 to 64, all people who are "committed to a lifetime of 
sobriety," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A professional staff would oversee the operation, and about a quarter of the 
beds would be available to the public on a walk-in basis, provided they can 
pay. Plans also include an underground parking garage, offices and a kitchen 
with a view of the park. 
</P>
<P>
To expand the site, the company twice has asked William Collins, 75, to sell 
his 25-year-old Wake Forest Road home next to the Wards' property to make room 
for a parking lot. But Collins said he won't budge. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the company) can do that, would they give me a permit to put in a pig 
farm?" Collins asked half-jokingly, adding that he and his invalid wife would 
have nowhere else to go if he had accepted the developers' offer of $250,000. 
"They can get away with it no matter what we do." 
</P>
<P>
The company, which built condominiums on the west side of the property, 
acquired the present halfway house when the wife of Clay Ellis, a man who once 
owned the tract, died more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Six recovering alcoholics live unsupervised in the single-story house, which 
neighbors say is a source of noise, traffic and junk -- including tires and 
mattresses strewn by the side of the house. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were really concerned about the neighborhood and the people living 
there now, they wouldn't have the mattress there now," Alice Beck said. 
"They're really in this for monetary reasons. We're the ones with the small 
pockets." 
</P>
<P>
But Dee Ward responded: "Sure it looks like hell now. Everything is still being 
planned." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the halfway house, who would have to move if Harbor House is 
approved, said the facility, which is managed by the Hamilton House of Corona 
del Mar, now offers them another chance at life. They said they would like to 
see a larger house that could touch more people. 
</P>
<P>
"Had it not been for this house, I don't know if I'd be here," said Ed Peden, a 
46-year-old Vietnam veteran who is paying $75 a week to live there. "This has 
benefited me. I can now continue going on. I don't need to sleep in parks 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Peden and fellow resident Dennis Deguzman said that through group discussions 
and everyday life with other recovering alcoholics, they have new-found 
confidence to take on responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm realizing what living is," Deguzman said. "It's a program of honesty. You 
don't have to lie anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Peden, who has lived in the house since Dec. 30, 1988, said residents of the 
house are always sober and that they respect the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprises me that we've had complaints, to be honest with you," he said, 
sitting on a sofa in the living room of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Such homes can coexist peacefully with neighbors, said Kay Brown, executive 
director of New Directions, a two-story, 6,000-square-foot halfway house for 
women alcoholics in a residential neighborhood on Willo Lane in Costa Mesa. And 
success rates for women staying off alcohol can be as high as 50%, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not an attraction for the bad element," Brown said. "We've been 
fortunate with good neighbors. I hope it can work in other areas." 
</P>
<P>
Still, College Park residents are finding parallels to the SOS controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt sorry for those residents," Jones said of neighbors of the Rea 
Community Center. "I just don't want the same to happen to us."

SAN CLEMENTE URGED TO APPLY GROWTH LIMITS DURING APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new furor over a slow-growth initiative erupted in San Clemente on Wednesday 
as a citizens group claimed that Measure E should continue to be enforced 
despite being ruled unconstitutional last fall by an Orange County Superior 
Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bunge, vice president of San Clementeans for Managed Growth, a 
slow-growth group, said Wednesday that he believes that city growth is 
spiraling out of control in the absence of Measure E. 
</P>
<P>
"This (Measure E) is the only sensible procedure which can be implemented to 
prevent irreparable harm to our community," Bunge said. "Once the hills are 
destroyed and development is in its place, the environment cannot be restored 
to its original condition." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they are referring the thorny legal matter to an attorney, 
and no immediate action is expected. 
</P>
<P>
"My belief, based on what we've been told by our city attorney in the past, is 
that Measure E does not have to be enforced (during appeal), but this is 
something we'll likely refer to another attorney for a third opinion," said San 
Clemente Mayor Brian J. Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Measure E allows growth only if city services are not eroded as a result. The 
initiative, for instance, requires that either the city or developers come up 
with a way to pay for more streets or improved roads if a development would 
increase traffic congestion by 1% or more at an intersection or highway link. 
</P>
<P>
Measure E was overwhelmingly approved by San Clemente voters in June, 1988, 
then struck down Oct. 19 by Superior Court Judge John C. Woolley, who ruled 
that it placed an unfair burden on developers. The initiative has not been 
enforced since then, although Woolley's decision is being appealed by San 
Clementeans for Managed Growth. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, San Clementeans for Managed Growth released an opinion from their 
attorney, Mark I. Weinberger of San Francisco, which said that Measure E 
remains alive during appeal and must be enforced by San Clemente city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the City Council, Weinberger wrote: "We are writing to advise 
the city that due to the current status of the litigation challenging the 
initiative, Measure E remains in full force and effect, and the city is 
obligated to enforce its provisions." 
</P>
<P>
Weinberger's letter added: "In our view, failure to enforce and implement 
Measure E at this time is clearly erroneous, and as a result the city should 
take immediate steps to carry out the provisions of the initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Weinberger said previous California court rulings have held that lower court 
orders in such matters are not enforced during appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Brouillette, president of San Clementeans for Managed Growth, said 
Wednesday that she and other slow-growth advocates are cheered by Weinberger's 
legal opinion. She said the organization will demand that city government 
reinstate Measure E and enforce it during the appeal process. 
</P>
<P>
"If we wait until after all the legal proceedings are over, the city of San 
Clemente will already be overbuilt," she said. "Already the city is suffering 
from too much growth. The water shortage we're having in the city this summer 
is caused by too much growth." 
</P>
<P>
The 4th Circuit Court of Appeal in Santa Ana will hear the appeal of Measure E. 
But due to a crowded court docket, a decision in the matter is not likely until 
next summer at the earliest, according to Weinberger. 
</P>
<P>
Brouillette charged on Wednesday that San Clemente city government has been 
allowing too much growth and development since Measure E was struck down. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor pro Tem Candace Haggard, in a separate interview, said she disagreed with 
Brouillette's criticism. "The City Council has established a growth-management 
committee, and it's very much in the spirit of Measure E," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Rice similarly defended the city's actions in managing growth and 
development.

2 OFF-RAMPS TO CLOSE ON COSTA MESA FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motorists who use the southbound Costa Mesa Freeway are in for a jolt this 
month: Heavily used off-ramps at Dyer Road and McFadden Avenue will be closed 
because of freeway-related reconstruction work, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Monday, the eastbound Dyer Road off-ramp will be closed from the 
southbound Costa Mesa Freeway for about a month. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, on Sunday, Aug. 13, the old McFadden off-ramp from the southbound 
Costa Mesa Freeway will be closed permanently. The new McFadden off-ramp is 
scheduled to open by the end of the month, according to Caltrans spokesman 
Albert Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
"Because many commuters rely on these ramps, we suggest Edinger Avenue and 
MacArthur Boulevard as alternate routes for those commuting in the area," 
Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials said they fear negative reaction to the closures because 
there has not been much advance warning. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out about this at the last minute from our field staff," said Kristen 
Argo, an aide to Miranda.

PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN FOR OCEAN AID BENEFIT HITS THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Promoters of the Ocean Aid concert launched a publicity drive in Orange County 
on Wednesday in an effort to attract surfers and beach-goers to the two-day 
event next month that is aimed at raising money to clean up the oceans. 
</P>
<P>
"You see all kinds of garbage in the waters and under your board," said Wendy 
Botha, a 23-year-old champion surfer from Australia. "People have to understand 
that the oceans need help." 
</P>
<P>
In order to snare the attention of the younger crowd, concert promoters held a 
news conference in Huntington Beach, where one of the world's top surfing 
events, the Op Pro Surfing Championship, is in its third day. 
</P>
<P>
The concert, to be held Sept. 3 and 4 at the Irvine Bowl in Laguna Beach, is 
the first fund-raiser for the Ocean Aid Foundation, which was established last 
year by Tustin-based Ocean Pacific Sunwear Ltd., a manufacturer of beachwear. 
New Wave rock band Devo will headline the concert, which is expected to raise 
about $50,000 for groups that specialize in protecting the ocean, including 
Save Our Shores in Laguna Beach and Heal the Bay in Santa Monica, Ocean Pacific 
spokesman Jerry Crosby said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so bad in the water nowadays that you can't eat the local fish" said 
drummer John Vatos, a member of Food for Feet, another band that will appear at 
the concert. "There's got to be a push somewhere for people to realize what is 
happening in their oceans." 
</P>
<P>
Surfer Brian Lucas, 15, of Huntington Beach, who was watching the championship, 
said he would go to the concert as well as get more information about cleaning 
up the waters. 
</P>
<P>
"I know so much is polluting the waters," Brian said. "Something like the big 
oil spill (in Alaska) ruins the ocean, and you ain't going to be able to surf 
in that." 
</P>
<P>
Crosby said that pamphlets and petitions concerning ocean issues will be 
distributed to the audience during the concert. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Green, president of Heal the Bay, said that donations would help defray 
the cost of printing pamphlets detailing the extent of ocean pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"We can use whatever money we can lay our hands on," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
She said her organization has been successful in reaching out to younger 
people. "We count on these young people to talk to their peers and let them 
know what is going on at their own shores." 
</P>
<P>
Beth Leeds, president of Save Our Shores, said young people want to help the 
ocean cleanup effort, but many do not know where to start. 
</P>
<P>
"They know the Pacific Ocean off our own coasts has gotten worse. They are 
willing and able to help," Leeds said.

UNITED WAY AIMS HIGH, PLEDGES BROADER ROLE

United Way of Orange County has set a fund-raising goal of $20.5 million during 
its 1989 campaign and has pledged to take a more active role in drawing public 
attention to specific issues, officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A more aggressive position on issues is needed to respond to the upsurge in 
health and social problems that have accompanied county economic and population 
growth, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This year is critical for the organizations supported through the United Way 
campaign," said 1989 campaign chairman Ronald L. Merriman, managing partner of 
KPMG Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co. "Our response to these problems must begin now 
if we are to close the gap between services available to people and the growth 
of problems." 
</P>
<P>
United Way provides money for 121 health and social service organizations with 
proceeds from the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly through payroll deductions, the organization last year raised $18.6 
million, an 11% increase over the 1987 total. Despite increases in overall 
giving in recent years, the campaign has not met its goal in each of the last 
four years, falling about $600,000 short last year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they are somewhat concerned that county corporations still 
contribute far less per capita than comparable areas. The national amount 
raised per capita, for example, averages about $17, while the rate in Orange 
County averages $8. 
</P>
<P>
Officials attribute the gap to such varied reasons as the multitude of business 
areas in the county, rather than a single defined "downtown," and a relatively 
youthful economic base that has not established a tradition of giving to 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
To help meet new funding goals, the campaign this year will target the Asian 
and Pacific business communities and high-income individuals, groups that have 
been untapped in the past, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The local campaign will also focus on such key issues as substance abuse, child 
care and health care, which were identified as priorities in a community 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of service providers, community leaders and more than 1,000 county 
residents was the first to sample community opinion since a similar one in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Service providers ranked child care, drug abuse, housing assistance and 
low-cost housing as top priorities, in that order. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders counted drug abuse, transportation, low-cost housing and 
temporary shelter as foremost concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Among the general public, however, drug abuse, homelessness, child care, health 
care, acquired immune deficiency syndrome and race relations emerged as the 
most pressing concerns.

ORIOLES CAN DO NO RIGHT THESE DAYS

<P>
The Baltimore Orioles are at the point where a slump degenerates into a 
catastrophe, where a succession of little slips accelerates into a freefall. 
</P>
<P>
Where they once did no wrong, they now do no right. Where they once cleared the 
bases with two-out hits, they now strike out. Where they once made daring plays 
that left opponents fumbling, they now fumble. Where they once pitched game 
after resplendent game, as though it wasn't even a challenge, they now ask for 
one well-pitched game, start to finish. Just one. And don't get it. 
</P>
<P>
Not so long ago, it seemed they might never lose. Now it seems they might never 
win again. They are tense, always behind, their eyes suddenly full of the sad 
fear that overwhelmed them at the beginning of last season, when they lost 21 
straight games. Now they have lost 13 of 14, and that old, spoiled-meat smell 
is back. Horrors! Stephen King has slipped in and started writing the script: 
Return of the Zer-O's. Yes, they're baaaaack. 
</P>
<P>
That they still are in first place in the American League East is but an 
illusion. They are chasing the teams chasing them. The others are gathering 
their wits for a pennant race. The Orioles are at wits' end, out of pitchers 
and answers. They have splashed about in the sunny happiness that is first 
place for 68 straight days, but unless they straighten their sagging posture, 
their tenure will soon end. 
</P>
<P>
This hard truth became evident Tuesday at Fenway Park, where the Orioles played 
two games with the Boston Red Sox, one in the afternoon and one at night. Given 
two chances to lessen the pain of the bruises they have gathered on this Road 
Trip From Hell, they failed twice, accelerating their potato-sack drop from the 
heights. 
</P>
<P>
Before the largest day-night doubleheader audience in Fenway history -- more 
than a total of 70,000 -- the Orioles first lost a heartbreaker, a drama that 
turned on a pop fly lost in the sun, a failed bunt that set up the winning run 
and a passel of blown scoring chances. The second game was a Mike Tyson fight. 
One punch -- Nick Esasky's three-run homer in the fourth inning -- and down 
went the sucker. 
</P>
<P>
And so the Orioles were left with hard numbers to study. Just 13 days ago, they 
left home with a 7 1/2-game lead, humming along as comfortably as a tuned-up 
roadster out for a spin on a new blacktop. Now, their lead is one game. If they 
lose to the Red Sox on Wednesday night, they will return home Thursday in 
second place. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't happened overnight, but it has been a very short period of time," 
Baltimore Manager Frank Robinson said. "It's tough to believe we're playing the 
way we've been playing. Every game I think we're going to go back to the way 
we're capable of playing. Then after each game we come back and say, 'Well, 
maybe the next one.' It's tough to believe it's happening, but it is. I see it. 
And it's not going to go away until we make it go away." 
</P>
<P>
It would not take that much. One well-pitched game. One clutch hit that turned 
a loss into a win, frowns back into smiles. One moment of improvised 
brilliance; something. But when losing hangs around, it becomes a habit. "The 
more it's there, the more you know it's there," Robinson said. "The more you 
lose, the more pressure you feel. It becomes a harder cycle to break." 
</P>
<P>
When the cycle lasts this long, every mistake becomes magnified, for without 
it, perhaps, the cycle might have ended. The first game Tuesday was full of 
such very little, very big mistakes. It was a game that could have come close 
to righting the Orioles, and instead, it made matters worse.

A LONG WAY TO ROME, MAYBE SHORTCUT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Everyone thought it was a bad move when the Los Angeles Clippers made Danny 
Ferry their No. 1 draft pick. Tuesday, it got worse. Ferry dropped the Big One 
on the NBA's Lottery Lifers: He told them to go scratch, and signed a contract 
to play in Rome instead. One year, at one million bucks. A lot more than three 
coins in the fountain. You won't hear Danny Ferry sing "I Love L.A." unless he 
sings it in Italian. 
</P>
<P>
He's now property of Messaggero Rome of the Italian League. Think of it as Duke 
with tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
I say "now" because I wouldn't bet the cannoli he'll be there for the whole 
season. He probably has an escape clause that allows him to come back and play 
for an NBA team other than the Clippers. His father is probably already hard at 
work on such a deal. Rome may be The Eternal City, but Danny Ferry plans to use 
it as a layover. So the Bullets are still alive in the Danny Ferry Sweepstakes. 
The only NBA team he definitely won't play for is the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
That's what this is all about: Bob Ferry's plot to engineer a trade to move 
Danny Ferry as far away from the Clippers as possible. A sound move. "No one in 
his right mind wants anything to do with the Clippers," one NBA executive said. 
</P>
<P>
The franchise hasn't made the playoffs since 1976, when the Clippers played as 
the Buffalo Braves. Of course, this is impossible in a league where 16 teams 
make the playoffs. Year after year they end up in the lottery; David Stern will 
have retired as commissioner of the NBA, NFL and NHL before they get out of the 
lottery. Being with the Clippers means always having to say "I'm sorry." It's 
the NBA's answer to Jiffy Lube -- every 10,000 miles they change coaches. 
Everyone they draft either breaks his leg, forgets how to shoot or would rather 
hold his breath until he turns blue than play for them. I admit I was surprised 
when the Clippers chose Ferry. I figured they'd take someone from Albania. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ferry was livid when the Clippers drafted Danny. That was the last team Bob 
expected would choose his son. "I don't understand it," Bob angrily snapped 
after the pick was announced. Indeed, it was inexplicable. The Clippers already 
had a stamp collection of fine young players at Ferry's natural position, power 
forward: Charles Smith, Ken Norman and Joe Wolf had to play there. And the best 
prospect of all, Danny Manning, was likely to find himself there as well, since 
his knee injury limits his mobility. 
</P>
<P>
The picks that made the most sense for the Clippers were Glen Rice or Sean 
Elliott. Both were available. Taking Ferry seemed either totally idiotic (which 
is par for the course with the Clippers) or a preamble to a major trade. Ferry 
himself assumed he'd be traded. He'd seen it happen. A year ago, Philadelphia 
picked Charles Smith only to ship him to the Clippers. In 1984, Danny's dad had 
drafted Dinner Bell Mel Turpin, and immediately dispatched him to Cleveland. So 
even as he placed a Clippers cap on his head, Danny figured it for a momentary 
wardrobe. "I'm still not sure I'll be in L.A.," he grinned, though he couldn't 
for a moment have thought he'd end up in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, Roma. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the Richfield Coliseum, Ferry gets the original Colosseum. (Memo 
from Pete Rose: Kid, bet the Lions.) Instead of the Fabulous Forum, Ferry gets 
the original Forum. He'll be such a star, they'll name a pasta for him; you'll 
be able to order veal marsala with a side order of linguini al Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
This may be an interesting reversal in trends. Many great European players seem 
anxious to come to America. Golden State signed a Soviet guard. The Hawks just 
signed a Soviet forward. The Lakers and the Celtics drafted Yugoslavians. 
Drazen Petrovic, Yugoslavia's Pistol Pete, has gone to court to clear his way 
to negotiate with Portland. Ferry is one of the first to go the other way. Jose 
Ortiz signed with a team in Spain rather than the Utah Jazz two years ago so he 
could remain eligible to play in the 1988 Olympics, but Ortiz speaks fluent 
Spanish. It's unlikely Ferry can say much more in Italian than "pizza" and 
"Sophia Loren." 
</P>
<P>
How long Ferry will play in Rome -- if at all -- is unclear. Practice starts 
this week, the season begins in late September. Ferry could actually play some 
games and still be back for the NBA opener in early November, providing the 
Clippers agree to trade him. You'd think they would, rather than face the 
humiliation of the draft's No. 2 overall pick winding up completely worthless. 
"But we're dealing with the Clippers now," the NBA exec reminds us. "There's no 
guiding intelligence there. Eventually, they'll trade Ferry. But no one knows 
when." 
</P>
<P>
What were Ferry's options? He could sue to have the draft declared illegal. But 
his dad wouldn't want any part of a lawsuit that threatened to unravel the 
fabric of his business. He could join the Navy; it's worked for David Robinson. 
He could lounge around for a year and go back into the draft in 1990 (where the 
Clippers might take him again). Or he could play in another country. He chose 
that option, and in a prepared statement expressed admiration for Tom McMillen 
and Bill Bradley, both of whom played in Italy while Rhodes scholars. 
</P>
<P>
However long he plays in Italy, Ferry will find a reasonably good brand of 
ball. Bob McAdoo and Micheal Ray Richardson play there. (In the understatement 
of the year so far, Messaggero team president Carlos Sama said, "With Ferry, 
our team makes a substantial leap in quality." What I'm waiting to hear is the 
coach say, "I don't care what he did at Duke, this is Italy. Danny Ferry's got 
to satisfy me he can play in this league.") The Italian league is 
outside-shooting oriented, which should be good for Ferry's game. The zones 
won't help him defensively, but playing against older players will. All in all, 
culturally and professionally it should be an enjoyable stay. Particularly 
considering the alternative.

SHE AND HER HUSBAND ARE IN THE SAME BOAT;

MAGERS AT HOME ON WATER, CLAY, GRASS . . .

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pittsburgh is known as the city of Three Rivers, but growing up there did 
little to prepare Gretchen Magers for life at sea. 
</P>
<P>
The fresh but not so clean waters of the Monongahela, Allegheny and Ohio rivers 
bear little resemblance to the salty Pacific Ocean. And life on the Gypsy Lady 
is far from the hills of Pittsburgh, even if the 34-foot sailboat spends most 
of its time docked at Harbor Island. 
</P>
<P>
"All I had done with boats was canoeing," Magers said of her nautical training 
while growing up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
But for another year at least, the Gypsy Lady is home for Magers and her 
husband, Stephen, a graduate student at San Diego State. That is, when Magers 
is not out on the professional tennis tour. 
</P>
<P>
This week, she is combining a visit home and her work. Magers is competing in 
Great Bank American tennis tournament at the San Diego Tennis and Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
In tonight's final match on center court, Magers will play in the second round 
against Angelica Gavaldon, a 15-year-old junior from Our Lady of Peace High 
School. Gavaldon is coming off a three-set upset of eighth-seeded Ros Fairbank. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go in worrying about her," said Magers, 25, who beat Pascale 
Paradis, 6-1, 7-5 in her first-round match Monday. "I have lost to 15-year-olds 
before, and it is going to happen again. I can't worry about her age." 
</P>
<P>
If Magers sounds undaunted by the prospect of facing an amateur with nothing to 
lose, it probably is because she is playing as consistently well as she has in 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
She is coming off her best Wimbledon, where she reached the quarterfinals 
before she was eliminated by eventual runner-up Martina Navratilova, 6-1, 6-2. 
She also has a two-set victory over fifth-ranked Arantxa Sanchez, the French 
Open champion from Spain, in the Players Championship in March. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had some of the best wins of my career this year," Magers said. 
</P>
<P>
The most exciting probably was her second-round Wimbledon match against 
ninth-ranked Pam Shriver. The match was long and tense, with Magers winning the 
final set of the three-set match, 12-10. 
</P>
<P>
Magers went on to reach the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event for the first 
time since she did it in the 1983 French Open as a 19-year-old freshman at 
Trinity (Tex.) College. 
</P>
<P>
The next year at Trinity, she met her future husband. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen was on the football team, but it was in biology class that the two 
became friends. They married in December 1986 and moved to San Diego the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego was an ideal location because Stephen could work on his master's 
degree in exercise physiology while Magers took advantage of the climate and 
availability of other pros to work on her game. 
</P>
<P>
"There are tons of tennis players our here," Magers said, "and the weather is 
even better out here than Texas." 
</P>
<P>
When they first arrived, they took an apartment in La Mesa. But after a few 
months of paying rent double what they were used to San Antonio, they thought 
of getting a place of their own. Their problem was no different than that for 
any potential first-time home buyer in San Diego -- sticker shock and economic 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be more psychological than the actual burden of it," Magers said. "We 
were renting a small house in San Antonio for $350. We were in a condo out 
here, and it was $750. 
</P>
<P>
"We were only going to be here for two years for sure, and we really didn't 
want to get into a house. Stephen doesn't have a job yet, and my job is up and 
down. I can get injured this afternoon. We just weren't ready for the 
responsibility of a house." 
</P>
<P>
The boat, Magers quickly points out, was her husband's idea. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something that he kind of always wanted to do, which he never told me 
before," Magers said. "I came back from a trip and he told me, 'Let's go down 
and look at some boats.' I said, 'Why?' " 
</P>
<P>
Stephen had a sailing background from his days growing up in Houston and 
sailing in Galveston Bay. "As much as I enjoy tennis," Magers said, "he enjoys 
sailing." 
</P>
<P>
And he was itching to get back on the water. He also told her a boat would be a 
good investment. 
</P>
<P>
Magers was not so sure. But in the spirit of marital harmony, she went along. 
Almost two years later, she has even found it in herself to work up some 
enthusiasm for the adventure. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a great experience," Magers said. "We have met some really 
fantastic people that, if we lived in the condos, we wouldn't have been exposed 
to. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten a lot more out of it than we thought we would -- the pleasure we 
have had sailing and living a different life style. We were up there in 
Yuppyville up there in one of the condos, and it is real easy to go along with 
what everyone else is doing." 
</P>
<P>
Although some luxuries are missing ("We don't have a Cuisinart," Magers said) 
and her doubles partner this week, Robin White, has possession of her stereo 
and futon, it is not as though the Magers are roughing it. The boat has two 
berths and is equipped with most all of the modern conveniences, including a 
microwave and VCR. 
</P>
<P>
And because Magers spends so much time on the road and outside when she's in 
town, the small living quarters do not seem too confining. As for taking the 
boat out to sea, Magers usually leaves that to Stephen. 
</P>
<P>
"I do a little bit when it is good conditions," Magers said. "But I get a 
little nervous. I'm still not real confident. When the wind starts blowing 
really strong, I'm really not confident. I'm much more confident being the crew 
and doing what Steve tells me to do." 
</P>
<P>
Land is where Magers is at her best -- no matter what the surface. 
</P>
<P>
She has reached the quarterfinals of Grand Slam events on three different 
surfaces -- 1982 U.S. Open (hard court), the French (clay) and Wimbledon 
(grass). 
</P>
<P>
She excels in no one facet but has no great weaknesses, either. 
</P>
<P>
Magers has risen steadily through the rankings this year, starting at 41 and 
reaching 33 after her Wimbledon performance, her highest since she was 28th as 
an amateur in July 1983. She entered play this week ranked 36th and with yearly 
earnings of $107,441, having already exceeded her record $96,160 of last year. 
</P>
<P>
By these measures, she is having her best year as a pro. But Magers strives for 
more. She wants a shot that will strike fear into her opponents, like Steffi 
Graf has with her powerful forehand. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never really had a big shot other than when my serve is on and just being 
quick," Magers said. 
</P>
<P>
That is the edge she said she needs to make a big jump in the rankings and 
reach the level where she contend more consistently. In three years as a pro, 
Magers has two tournament titles -- 1987 in Auckland, New Zealand, and 1988 in 
Schenectady, N.Y. Her best finish this year was again in Schenectady last week 
-- a 6-4, 6-3 semifinal loss to Laura Gildemeister. 
</P>
<P>
Magers said that because months and sometimes years between tournament 
victories can be discouraging, it is important to get the most out of the 
near-victories. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the success of the past few months has infused her with renewed 
dedication. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been very fortunate to have good results spaced out," Magers said. 
"Just when I'm about to get discouraged, I get a good win. It has taught me to 
hang in there. Something good might be around the corner, right when you are 
about to quit." 
</P>
<P>
Magers is hardly at the end of her career, but there is always time for 
reflection. Her immediate plans are clear -- play tennis and live in San Diego 
for another year while Stephen finishes his work at SDSU. After that, much may 
depend on Stephen's plans. SDSU does not offer a doctoral program in his field, 
so if he continues his studies, it might require a move back to the University 
of Texas in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
Magers said the two have an understanding that while he is in school, her 
tennis will pay the bills. But Magers said she looks forward to the time when 
she can stay at home and let Stephen go off to work. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand that this is the way it is for right now," Magers said. "I'm 
really going to enjoy those days when he is working, and I am staying at home, 
going biking all the time, doing what I want to do. I am looking forward to 
those days." 
</P>
<P>
But will those days include the Gypsy Lady? 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully," Magers said, smiling, "we will get a house and have a smaller 
boat, and it will be more of a hobby."

SHOW'S SEASON FINISHED AFTER HE HAS BACK SURGERY

Padre pitcher Eric Show, unwilling to have the uncertainty of a back problem 
hovering over him during the off-season, decided to have surgery Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The operation was performed by Dr. Roger Thorne at the Green Hospital of 
Scripps Clinic in La Jolla. Thorne repaired the fifth disk in the lumbar region 
of Show's lower back; Show is expected to be hospitalized four to five days. 
</P>
<P>
Show is expected to be able to exercise again in about six weeks and begin 
pitching during the off-season. Thorne said he believes Show will be fully 
recovered well before the start of spring training in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Show (8-6) was diagnosed as having a bulging disk during the spring and began 
experiencing problems in June. On July 1, he became the first Padre pitcher 
scratched from a start this season. 
</P>
<P>
He was expected to miss just one start, but his condition worsened. He was kept 
out until the All-Star break, with the Padres hopeful he

Football Coach Gene Murphy of Cal State Fullerton has signed a three-year 
contract extension through the 1992 season, school officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 49, is about to begin his 10th season with Fullerton, which has 
finished no worse than tied for second in the Big West Conference in five of 
the last six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's record at Fullerton is 48-56, not including two opponent forfeits, 
even though the Titans have played 70 of 104 games on the road over nine 
seasons. He was 15-7 in two seasons at North Dakota before coming to Fullerton 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously very pleased to extend Coach Murphy's contract," said Athletic 
Director Ed Carroll. "And we're happy to get it done now, so we can all 
concentrate on the 1989 season." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's athletic department is placing increased emphasis on academics, a 
move that has tightened admissions standards for athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"The contract places emphasis on academics, not on wins and losses," Carroll 
said. "Our priorities and objectives are about academics. We want Gene to win, 
but we also want him to know he has job security." ROBYN NORWOOD

TABLE TENNIS FEVER SPREADING QUICKLY AT ORANGE COAST COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
LOCAL CLUB HAS 260 MEMBERS, MAKING IT THE LARGEST, FINEST GROUP IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA

<P>
About five years ago, Terry Timmins caught a fever he hasn't been able to 
shake. He has fed it religiously, but it just seems to grow hotter. 
</P>
<P>
Timmins, 46, has table tennis fever. 
</P>
<P>
When he doesn't play the sport for a week, he says he has withdrawal pangs. 
</P>
<P>
"If you start gravitating and turning your car to one of the 25 table tennis 
clubs in Southern California when you know you should be doing something else 
like going to work, or studying, then you've got the fever," Timmins said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's beginning to affect your home life, and your boyfriend or girlfriend 
is beginning to question your mental stability, then you've got the fever." 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the fever led him and Joe Tran, a native of Vietnam, to start 
the Orange Coast College Table Tennis Club in Costa Mesa. The club has grown 
into the largest and, it is generally regarded, finest table tennis group in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Timmins, an OCC associate professor of sociology and anthropology from Laguna 
Beach, used to play table tennis in a class at OCC. He said Orange Coast is the 
only college in California that teaches table tennis as an accredited subject. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to play during lunch time in the patio between the cafeteria and the 
administration building outdoors in the sunlight and rain with wind and fog and 
leaves falling . . . we didn't care, it was fun," Timmins said. 
</P>
<P>
Timmins, Tran and others decided they wanted additional playing and practice 
time. Timmins offered to be faculty adviser so the club could get access to the 
gymnasium. The group raised $500 through memberships and, with matching funds 
from the Associated Students, purchased five used tables from a club in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Through tournaments and membership fees, the club has been able to purchase 24 
championship tables worth nearly $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Timmins, who remains the club's adviser, is still feeding his fever. He spends 
about 25-30 hours a week playing, organizing tournaments, teaching classes, 
giving lessons or driving to other clubs to practice. 
</P>
<P>
About 260 belong to the Orange Coast club, with players coming from Riverside, 
Los Angeles and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
The club members are playing a highly competitive and demanding sport that is 
not to be confused with Ping-Pong that's played in basements and back yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Table tennis is when the ball goes over 100 miles per hour and spins over 100 
times per second -- more than the blades of a 747 jet engine," Timmins said. 
</P>
<P>
It is the fastest racket sport in the world, said Timmins, who is very 
protective of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get into a battle with these other sports," he said, " but . . 
. in table tennis the playing surface is nine feet long and the ball travels in 
excess of 130 miles an hour when hit by a world-class player and over 100 miles 
per hour when hit by even your average good player. 
</P>
<P>
"The relative sizes of the court in badminton, table tennis and tennis are 
significant. You may be only 10 feet away from your opponent and the ball could 
be coming at you at over 100 miles an hour and you have to react, so how is 
badminton going to be faster than table tennis?" 
</P>
<P>
Though many Americans play the sport, only about 6,000 are registered members 
of the United States Table Tennis Assn., said Scott Mathews, the acting 
executive director of the United States Table Tennis Assn., the governing body 
for the sport in this country. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, China has about 40 million players. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, the sport has an image problem, according to Timmins, because 
it has similarities to Ping-Pong. But table tennis is a much more advanced and 
physically intense sport. 
</P>
<P>
"People see it as a lightweight sport where you are just pushing a little white 
ball back and forth across a little table and any old lady can do it," Timmins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., table tennis takes a back seat to more established sports. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe and Asia, it's taught in elementary schools or at government 
subsidized sports academies. Professional table tennis players can make a 
living in China and championship competition regularly draws crowds of 1,000 or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
International table tennis, which was a demonstration sport in the 1984 
Olympics and became a medal sport for the '88 Games, is popular with children 
and the elderly because players don't need to be big or strong. They just need 
good hand-eye coordination, Timmins said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Orange Coast club has players of all ages, from 12-year old Wang Ling 
to 75-year-old Bob Davies. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Whitlock, a 6-foot, 240-pound Orange Police detective, dispels the myth 
that table tennis is a game for lightweights. 
</P>
<P>
He attended college on a football scholarship and says people expect him to be 
a boxer or a weightlifter. But he enjoys table tennis for its spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
He has represented the police department in various tournaments and has 
competed in Australia, Bermuda and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every Friday from 6 to 10 p.m. and every Sunday from 2 to 6 p.m. (the 
club's hours of play), Whitlock, 44, holds down a table, routinely sweating 
through three or four shirts a session. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a finesse in chess where one could be a quadraplegic or a giant and 
play the game well," Whitlock said. "People don't equate the finesse to table 
tennis that there truly is and, it is that finesse that makes me keep coming 
back." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a physical and mental sport . . . a combination of which I haven't found 
in any other sport and I have played a lot -- rugby, Australian rules rugby, 
football, baseball, soccer. Each in its own respect offers someone a very great 
deal, but table tennis offers an ultimate combination of thought and action, a 
link that does not exist in any other sport, an intimacy between the mind and 
body not offered anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Hauer, who drives from his home in Laguna Niguel to Costa Mesa to play at 
the club because "that is where the best players play," calls table tennis the 
"essence of athletic activity. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes so fast . . . it seems a challenge because there are so many things 
that need to be done in such a short time. You have to adjust the direction you 
hit every ball based upon differing spins and that decision has to be made in 
your hand, not your head." 
</P>
<P>
Hauer honed his skills at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, 
Colo., in 1985 as a tutor of sorts overseeing the education of America's top 
juniors. 
</P>
<P>
The game is not the only thing that keeps players driving long distances to 
meet and compete. Friendships develop. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock made friends with a couple in Australia and they have visited each 
other's homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to Vancouver, British Columbia, to play in the World Police and 
Fire Games with police officers and firemen throughout the world," he said. "I 
am looking forward to competing against my first Soviet athletes. Hong Kong is 
coming. Japan is coming. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll compete talk, discuss, be nice. That's really what it's about. That's 
really the way to solve problems." 
</P>
<P>
Said Timmins: "It is an international game so we have a lot of foreign students 
and players. You name it, we've got it. We have every nationality in the world 
play here -- Iranians, people from the Middle East, people from the Caribbean 
Islands, Asians representing all Asian countries: Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, 
China, Japan, Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
"We cross political barriers. Ping-Pong is the most melting pot sport there is. 
It doesn't matter if you're from Taiwan, or mainland China. All (the players) 
do is talk table tennis. It is an addiction, it is a sickness, it is a fever, 
it breaks marriages up and it makes marriages." 
</P>
<P>
Diego Schaaf, 36, a club member who grew up in Switzerland, did not play 
seriously until he came the United States in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
His game has improved even more in the past year since he began playing at the 
Orange Coast club with Wei Wang, the nation's fourth-ranked female player. The 
two married in March. 
</P>
<P>
Schaaf said that as a beginner he had no concept of the crucial factors -- 
spin, footwork, ball placement -- that distinguish the game of Ping-Pong, from 
the sport of table tennis. At its higher levels, the sport requires quick 
reflexes, fast feet, good hand-eye coordination and patience. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I started playing, I had a completely different life," Schaaf said. 
"Ever since I started playing, I have played almost every day. I guess you 
would call that infected. A lot of people are that way. They go and play. When 
they start understanding the depth, how much there is to it, it becomes so 
intriguing, you just want to play every day." 
</P>
<P>
It's not hard to learn the sport, said Joe Tran, one of the club's founders and 
currently its president. But it takes about two years to learn how to hit and 
return all the strokes. 
</P>
<P>
The key is reading the spin on the ball. Players use a variety of arm motions 
to send the ball over the net with top spin, side spin, under spin or no spin. 
</P>
<P>
The different styles of hitting the ball are known as looping, chopping, 
spinning and killing. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California is one of the best places to learn because it is one of the 
two strongest table tennis areas in the nation. The corridor from Boston to 
Washington is first, Mathews of the USTTA said. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 300 clubs in the United States. The U.S. men's team ranks only 
20th internationally and the women's 12th, primarily because the sport is not a 
part of the elementary school system. 
</P>
<P>
But the USTTA is trying to change that, Mathews said. Table tennis has become 
part of school curricula in Portland, Ore., Baltimore and Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
And the USTTA has teamed with the Boys Club of America to introduce the sport 
at the organization's several hundred clubs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"That is our biggest source of juniors," Mathews said. "These kids happen to be 
very young and we want to introduce them at a young age and follow the European 
model."

TITANS' MURPHY SIGNS CONTRACT THROUGH '92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton football coach Gene Murphy has signed a three-year contract 
extension through the 1992 season, the school announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 49, is about to begin his 10th season with Fullerton, which has 
finished no worse than tied for second in the Big West Conference in five of 
the past six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy signed a five-year contract following the 1984 season during which 
Fullerton was ranked in the top 20 by United Press International. Fullerton 
went 11-1 that season, the only loss coming against Nevada Las Vegas, which was 
later forced to forfeit the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's record at Fullerton is 48-56, not including two opponent forfeits, 
despite the fact that the Titans have played 70 of 104 games on the road over 
nine seasons. He was 15-7 in two seasons at North Dakota before coming to 
Fullerton in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously very pleased to extend coach Murphy's contract," Fullerton 
director of athletics Ed Carroll said. "And we're happy to get it done now, so 
we can all concentrate on the 1989 season." 
</P>
<P>
The extension comes at a time when the Fullerton athletic department is placing 
increased emphasis on academics, a move that has tightened admissions standards 
for athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"The contract places emphasis on academics, not on wins and losses," Carroll 
said. "Our priorities and objectives are about academics. We want Gene to win, 
but we also want him to know he has job security." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton has reached a five-year deal with KMNY radio for the 
station to carry live broadcasts of all Titan football and men's basketball 
games, as well as a new weekly coaches' show. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton events have been broadcast by KMNY in the past, but because of 
contract conflicts, the broadcasts have on occasion been tape-delayed. During 
the football season last year, several Fullerton football games were delayed 
because KMNY was broadcasting Nebraska football games live. 
</P>
<P>
The one-hour coaches' show, which will air on Tuesday nights at 7 p.m., will be 
hosted by John Rebenstorf. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for broadcasts of selected baseball and women's 
basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to continue our working relationship with KMNY," Carroll said. 
"It's a big step for our program to lock up a quality signal in this very 
competitive sports radio market for the next five years." ROBYN NORWOOD

RUNNING: TRACK LOOKS BETTER TO HER THAN BEAUTY SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbie Ludovise 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After spending 700 hours last year cutting, curling and styling her way toward 
a career as a beautician, Maricela Benavides decided to pack away her scissors, 
throw out her nail files and head back to the track -- the place where she now 
knows she belonged all along. 
</P>
<P>
Benavides, The Times' female runner of the year in 1987, didn't know what to do 
after graduating from Santa Ana Valley High School the following June. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after seeing a television commercial for a Santa Ana beauty school, 
Benavides decided she would dedicate 1,600 hours of her life to becoming a 
licensed cosmetologist. 
</P>
<P>
The decision surprised -- and disappointed -- those who had hoped Benavides 
would continue her running in college, but Benavides said it was something she 
had to do. 
</P>
<P>
"After high school, I was confused, I didn't know what to do," Benavides said. 
"I thought going to beauty school would be good. I thought it would exciting, 
like getting away." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the school was only three miles from her parents' home in 
Santa Ana. And soon after she mastered the basics, Benavides said beauty had 
become a bore. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I liked the classes, but after awhile I hated them," Benavides said. 
"I mean, you just sit there all day, (practicing) on a doll's head." 
</P>
<P>
Although Benavides had basically given up running during this time, her 
interest in the sport was as great as ever. During the fall, she would track 
down cross-country meets just so she could watch the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go to races -- any races," she said. "I missed it badly." 
</P>
<P>
So much so, that in December, after six months of perfecting her cosmetology 
skills, Benavides quit the beauty business. She enrolled at Orange Coast 
College and started running again. 
</P>
<P>
Although she stepped on a rock and broke her foot in the first week -- keeping 
her out of track last season -- Benavides is ready to race once again. She's 
committed to OCC for the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"She's probably in better shape now than when I had her at Valley," said Santa 
Ana Valley Coach George Payan, Benavides' trainer. "She's so eager to run right 
now. That's the main thing." 
</P>
<P>
Benavides agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, you're always told what to do, how to run, when to run," she 
said. "But now, it's all up to you. You decide if you want to do it. Now that 
I'm back running, I know it's because I want to be. Now it's easy to get up to 
run at 6 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
Former Santa Ana Valley standout Jimmy Rodriguez has been invited to run in the 
Four-Minute Mile Challenge at the Jack in the Box Invitational Sunday at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who led the county this season in the 3,200 meters, was scheduled to 
compete in the open boys' mile, but meet promoter Al Franken made the switch 
Wednesday after Michigan native Brian Grosso dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez will compete against many of the nation's best prep milers, including 
state 1,600-meter champion Francis O'Neill of Escondido, Southern Section 
champion Todd Lewis of Burbank, Todd Orvis of Albany, N.Y., Bryan Dameworth, 
the state 3,200-meter runner-up from Agoura, and Christopher Schurz of Mesa, 
Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, Schurz and O'Neill will attend Central Arizona College this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Is Scott still it? In the men's mile Sunday at UCLA, former UC Irvine star 
Steve Scott will headline a top American field. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, the American record-holder in the event at 3:47.69 and a three-time 
Olympian, will face three other Olympians -- Jeff Atkinson, Doug Padilla and 
Jim Spivey -- along with fast-improving Terrance Herrington of Clemson, the 
1989 TAC champion. 
</P>
<P>
Although Scott is 33 and placed third at last month's national championships, 
many still consider the five-time TAC champion to be America's top miler. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve? Steve's the man," Atkinson said. "It's gonna take a tremendous effort 
to bump him off. I would not count him out in 1992." 
</P>
<P>
Added Padilla: "Steve Scott? Oh yeah. No doubt about it, he's it." 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine Coach Vince O'Boyle returned home from the Olympic Festival in 
Oklahoma City this week with his first coaching victory in a national meet. 
O'Boyle was the women's coach of the West team, which won the three-day track 
and field competition Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was neat because it came down to the mile relay (the final event)," O'Boyle 
said. "We had to get third place to hold on to the lead. The girls were really 
pumped up about it. It showed that the team concept is still important in 
track." 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine's Beth McGrann finished fifth in the 10,000 meters at the Festival. 
Although her time of 34 minutes 58.75 seconds is almost two minutes slower than 
her best, the performance was still impressive considering the fact that she 
broke her foot during the race. And the temperatures were in the high 80s 
despite 10 p.m. start. 
</P>
<P>
Other performances by area athletes included a sixth place by Los Alamitos' 
Mark Junkermann in the 1,500 and a fifth place in the 400 by former Westminster 
standout Arlise Emerson-Fielder. 
</P>
<P>

Nelson Gary III is considering making a tennis comeback at Pierce College this 
season -- a prospect that thrills Brahma Coach Paul Xanthos. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Gary was Pierce's top-seeded player and advanced to the junior college 
division men's singles final of the prestigious Ojai Valley tournament. In 
doing so, he caught the attention of several universities, among them UCLA and 
UC Irvine, and was offered an athletic scholarship to Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Then his promising future unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
Gary, who had a near-fatal addiction to drugs before enrolling at Pierce, 
squandered his money during a visit to New York in 1987. "I didn't eat or sleep 
for thirty days," he said. His weight plummeted from 160 to 132 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gary maintains that he was not taking drugs at the time, upon 
returning from New York he entered the ASAP treatment center in Van Nuys, where 
he now works as a drug rehabilitation technician. 
</P>
<P>
Gary says he will drop tennis again if the pressure to perform becomes too 
intense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to take it real easy and I don't know what's going to happen," he 
said. "If I feel like it's not too much of a strain, I'll continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I could play there all year and not lose a match. I could play there at No. 6 
and lose every match or I could play there for three days and walk off." 
</P>
<P>
Xanthos is fully prepared for the various possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be up to him," Xanthos said. "He would go at his own rate and if he 
felt there would be any pressure on him, there would be a halt to it 
immediately. I just love Nelson." 
</P>
<P>
Horse feathers: Gary might have some difficulty getting his tennis legs back. 
Except shooting a few free throws and playing an occasional game of Ping-Pong, 
he has done little in the way of exercising during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Lest his coach be too concerned about Gary's condition, however, consider this: 
A few weeks ago, Gary sprinted after an Arabian stallion for two miles at 6 
a.m. . . . down Topanga Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a Keystone Cops kind of thing," Gary said. 
</P>
<P>
The horse, which belonged to a friend of Gary's, got loose after its stable was 
improperly closed. Gary finally corralled the stallion and returned it to his 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
Back to school: Gabriel Harmat of Woodland Hills has a grandiose plan that he 
believes would benefit the tennis community: a developmental academy for 
juniors in the Valley area. He has begun to raise funds for the ambitious 
project, which he hopes will open within two years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's definitely a need for something like this," Harmat said. "They're 
tearing down these tennis facilities so the only places you can still play are 
at the high schools and parks. 
</P>
<P>
"In L.A., if you're not from a well-off family, chances are your kids will 
never play tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Harmat, ranked fifth in the International Tennis Federation men's 
35-and-over singles division, is pursuing his own career. In October, he will 
compete in the ITF World Championships in Santiago, Chile. Harmat advanced to 
the semifinal round in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago in Tel Aviv, Harmat won a gold medal in the 35-and-over singles 
division of the Maccabiah Games. 
</P>
<P>
Shattered dreams: Before Harmat gets too engrossed in his dream, perhaps he 
should talk to Steve Starleaf. 
</P>
<P>
For 20 months, Starleaf has spearheaded a campaign to build a 
championship-caliber tennis facility in Burbank. City officials put plans for 
the $8 million center on hold in July, saying the hillside complex might have a 
negative impact on nearby residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Starleaf expects the proposal to be reviewed by the Burbank Parks and 
Recreation Department on Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Said Starleaf: "I'm optimistic that the City Council will see the real issue 
and the real benefit to the city and hopefully give us the ERN (exclusive right 
to negotiate) and give us a chance to put the thing together. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed that it's taken this long to move forward. I understand, 
dealing with the city, that these things take a lot of time. But I'm looking 
forward to the conclusion of this project one way or another. I'm exhausted."

PHELPS PUSHES GARRISON, BUT END RESULT THE SAME

<P>
Terry Phelps might someday find a way to beat Zina Garrison, the sixth-ranked 
women's tennis player in the world, but for now she will have to settle for 
another close match. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps held off eight match points to force a third set before losing, 7-5, 6-7 
(9-7), 6-0, in the second round of the Great American Bank tournament Wednesday 
night at the San Diego Tennis and Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I'd ever win that thing," Garrison said. "The difference was I 
was much stronger physically at the end. I was able to get to the balls in the 
third set, and she wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Garrison's 2 1/2-hour match was the latest in what has been a rough tournament 
for the seeded players. 
</P>
<P>
After three days, only half of the eight seeded players remain. The latest to 
lose was No. 4 Patty Fendick of Sacramento, to Ann Grossman, 3-6, 7-5, 6-0, in 
the day's first second-round match. 
</P>
<P>
And the only other seeded player in action, No. 7 Claudia Kohde-Kilsch of West 
Germany, played her second three-set match of the tournament before eliminating 
Isabelle Demongeot of France, 6-1, 3-6, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Kohde-Kilsch earned the right to meet No. 1 Steffi Graf today a quarterfinal 
expected to begin about 1:30 p.m. That should mean another boost for 
attendance. With Graf having a day off, attendance dropped to 2,635 after 
averaging 3,905 for her first two matches. 
</P>
<P>
Those who came saw another taut match between No. 2-seeded Garrison and Phelps. 
Garrison has won their five career meetings, but this was the third to last 
three sets; five of their 13 games have been decided by a tie-breaker. 
</P>
<P>
"Terry is a good counter-puncher," Garrison said. "She never gives up. You have 
to stay on top of her all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The same could be said of Grossman, who tenaciously battled back against 
Fendick. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman dropped the final four games to lose the first set and let four set 
points get away before breaking Fendick to win the final game of the second 
set. She swept the final set to complete a streak of eight games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"This tournament is not going to be easy for me," Grossman said. "I've got to 
play my guts out." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was a reminder of the kind of success she had here last year when, 
as a 17-year-old amateur, she came out of the qualifiers to advance to the 
final against Stephanie Rehe. 
</P>
<P>
She lost, 6-1, 6-1, but the experience convinced her to turn professional. 
Since then, she has played 24 tournaments, more than any player on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Now she is back where it began. This is one farm girl from Grove City, Ohio, 
who finds the beaches of San Diego a comfortable change. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel at home here," Grossman said. "When I get to San Diego, I know I 
am going to play well." 
</P>
<P>
As much as Grossman likes San Diego, Fendick would just as soon forget her 
experiences here. 
</P>
<P>
She entered last year's tournament as the top-seeded player but withdrew in the 
middle of her first-round match with a strained calf muscle. This time, not 
only did she lose to Grossman, she had to endure the pestering of an overly 
friendly fan. 
</P>
<P>
Fendick said the women asked for her autograph during a court change after the 
first game of the third set. Fendick declined. The women then proceed to loadly 
encourage Fendick while she was serving. 
</P>
<P>
After the loss, the woman again approached for an autograph. Fendick again 
declined, this time not so politely. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'I'm sorry. I didn't mean to break your concentration. Just sign 
this for me,' " Fendick said. "I told her, 'Get away from me before I take a 
swing.' " 
</P>
<P>
The experience was not what Fendick needed as she works to return to top form 
after missing more than three months during the late winter and spring because 
of torn shoulder muscles. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time back from an injury, I didn't know what to expect," Fendick 
said. "I've been told not to panic. But I'm panicking." 
</P>
<P>
Tournament Notes 
</P>
<P>
Robin White of Del Mar advanced to the quarterfinals, beating Wendy White of 
Fort Worth, Tex., 6-3, 6-4. She later teamed with Gretchen Magers of San Diego 
to reach the doubles semifinals by eliminating the top-seeded team of Patty 
Fendick and Jill Hetherington, 7-6 (9-7), 7-5.

ERIC HANSCOM WOULD RATHER SURF KAYAK 
</P>

<P>
He is more than qualified to wear a suit and tie, sit behind a desk and push 
and sign papers. Eric Hanscom's resume proves as much. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't too long after a few attorneys had a good, hearty chuckle at his 
expense that Hanscom decided he would be a lot more content spending his days 
in a kayak. So his office is not in a big building. It is just off the shore of 
the beaches of La Jolla. And no, he doesn't wear a tie to work. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Hanscom, 31, won the surf kayaking world championship last year in 
an international competition held in Lahinch, Ireland. The U.S. team, competing 
for the first time and composed of virtual unknowns, was the surprise winner of 
the overall championship. 
</P>
<P>
Surf kayaking is a relatively new sport, though Hanscom guesses the techniques 
have their origins in the methods Eskimos used to transport seals. 
</P>
<P>
Hanscom devotes full time to improving both his kayaking maneuvers and 
awareness of the sport. This year, he will compete on and coach the U.S. 
national team, which will travel to Wales at the end of August to defend its 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
All this brings us back to his resume and how kayaking became his full-time 
occupation. Reading from top to bottom, you will find that he graduated with 
honors from UC Santa Barbara with a degree in aquatic biology and environmental 
studies, has a law degree from Hastings College of Law and received four 
fellowships while working toward a Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked in between are items such as this: "Phycological Discovery: Algal 
specimen found in intertidal drift, Deveraux Point, California, 11/80. Specimen 
thought to be Cystoceira osmundacea subspecies of hybrid of C. osmundacea and 
Sargassum muticum." 
</P>
<P>
Got that? 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom, there is a section devoted to personal interests, where Hanscom 
lists some of his achievements in both surfing -- he was a member of the 
California Collegiate All-Star team for six years -- surf kayaking and 
technical rock climbing. 
</P>
<P>
And that's what made him the subject of ridicule. Apparently, several attorneys 
thought it rather amusing that someone applying for a job in a law firm 
actually found time to surf. 
</P>
<P>
There were little indications throughout school that law might not be his bag. 
Once, he tried to organize a rock climbing expedition and had only one person 
sign up out of a student body of 540. The longer he was in law school, the more 
uneasy he became. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I got through law school, I had such a phobia about three-piece 
suits and offices," Hanscom said. "I always felt like an outsider. I never felt 
like I belonged. I questioned seriously whether I wanted to belong." 
</P>
<P>
The interviews after graduation were all fairly similar. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a couple of guys just on the floor," Hanscom said. "I think I was 
probably the most humorous interview in Hastings." 
</P>
<P>
Though his father, Richard, is a judge and his sister, Wendy, is an attorney, 
Eric decided to break family tradition and pursue a Ph.D. in marine biology, 
which gave him the time for surf kayaking. 
</P>
<P>
For Richard, Eric's decision wasn't a letdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he may have thought I was disappointed, but I'm not because I don't 
think anybody should go into work that they don't find enjoyable," Richard 
said. "It probably was his mistake going to law school. Law isn't for 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, marine biology wasn't really the solution. UC Santa Cruz is 
considered progressive because of it's system of optional grading, but from 
Hanscom's perspective, it wasn't progressive in its approach to students. He 
had trouble finding professors who approved of his methods, which centered less 
around hours in the laboratory looking into a microscope and more around field 
work. 
</P>
<P>
One time, a group of the graduate students were sitting around telling what 
they had done during a two-week vacation. Most had real rip-roaring stories, 
such as doing experiments separating DNA from plants. When Hanscom told of 
going to Baja on a surf kayaking trip, another student said dryly: "Eric, you 
just lead such a more exciting life than all of the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought later, 'Yeah, she's right,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
So, when the opportunity to join the newly formed U.S. national team presented 
itself, Hanscom opted to skip the Ph.D. and tackle the waves. 
</P>
<P>
A world champion was born. 
</P>
<P>
Surf kayaking is all about extremes. It just depends who is commanding the 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
To the novice, it can be very upside down. That's the way the beginner spends 
much of his time. The wave hits, you ride for a while, lose your balance and 
find yourself climbing out of the top of the boat, now located where the bottom 
used to be. 
</P>
<P>
To an expert like Hanscom, surf kayaking is . . . well, let him tell it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like you can't imagine anything better," he says. "I've had that feeling 
about very few other things in life. It's a situation that couldn't possibly be 
improved upon. Sometimes you sit down to a pesto pizza and say this couldn't be 
improved upon. It's like having a pesto pizza for five hours and not gaining 
any weight afterward." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every time Hanscom goes out in the water, surfers watch him twisting, 
turning and gliding in the surf and ask him what it's like to ride a wave in a 
boat rather than a board. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have to get some plastic business cards," he said. "I think, as 
with any new sport, it has sort of a freak image." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, this sport has some similarities to boogie boarding because, unlike 
surfing, a novice can go out and have a good time right away, upside down or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
Experts usually have a very good time and can even right themselves after 
capsizing with a turn of the paddle and a twist of the body. But even the best 
can run into trouble now and then. Hanscom was once asked to surf for a video 
promotional tape on a day when the wind was high and the surf was rough. 
Paddling out to position himself for catching waves, Hanscom ran into a 
15-footer. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember looking at it and thinking, 'I'm really going to get hit hard,' " 
he says. "I knew I was going to get absolutely killed." 
</P>
<P>
He went flying over the wave, took a nose dive into the next and lost his 
helmet and paddle. Next thing he knew he was tumbling toward the shore. His 
helmet and paddle arrived on the next wave. That ended the photo session. 
</P>
<P>
Last year in Ireland, Hanscom was an unknown quantity, but he quickly impressed 
everybody with his precise moves and agility in the water. And not only did he 
win the championship, but Christine Calverley, a San Diegan taught by Hanscom, 
won the women's title. 
</P>
<P>
When the team goes to Wales this year, Hanscom is aware he'll need to stockpile 
some new tricks. He has already been informed by members of the Irish team that 
they are studying the video tape of his performance last year and practicing 
his style. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's championship was really a bittersweet experience for Hanscom. Most 
of his teammates were eliminated in the preliminary qualifying round. The night 
he won, he had very mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"The crown had some thorns on it," he said. "The night I won, I took off for a 
four-hour walk. It's a hard feeling to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
That he had that feeling is perhaps indicative of why he highly regarded as an 
instructor. Some of the money he makes to support himself is earned by giving 
surf kayaking lessons, and he gets rave reviews from his students. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so apparent that he's a natural teacher," said one of them, Kevin 
Montgomery. "I had taken two classes prior to taking a class with Eric. The 
classes with him were so much more effective. He is careful to positively 
reinforce anything. It's a very low-stress teaching method." 
</P>
<P>
All the while, Hansom doesn't tumble into the category of the stereotypical 
surfer. He won't call you dude, and his hair isn't long, blond and stringy. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard him say cowabunga once," Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is one thing he will say on the subject of those who live the surfing 
stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are living in a dream world," he said. "There are some people 
that are not facing reality. You've got to work really hard at something if you 
want it to work for you." 
</P>
<P>
That much he has proven.

FIRM TO HALT FALSE CLAIMS FOR DIET PILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Tustin company that advertised its weight-loss pill as "the diet miracle of 
the '90s" has agreed to stop making false claims about the product, which was 
the subject of an eight-month investigation by the U.S. Postal Inspection 
Service, federal authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges have been filed against Jordon Whitney Inc. or its 
officers, John. J. and Clare W. Kogler of Santa Ana, said Postal Inspector 
Donald Obritsch. Such charges could be filed if the Koglers break their consent 
agreement with the postal service. 
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, which was signed on July 24, the Koglers also must 
refund all money spent on Anorex 2000 to customers who request it, Obritsch 
said. The Koglers could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fat-Burning Machine' 
</P>
<P>
Obritsch said that the Koglers have agreed to stop "falsely representing that 
Anorex 2000 will aid in weight loss or fat reduction." 
</P>
<P>
Jordon Whitney advertised Anorex 2000 in about 100 newspapers nationwide 
between January and April. The ads bragged that the product would turn the body 
into a "fat-burning machine," Obritsch said. 
</P>
<P>
Anorex 2000 was touted as "an all-natural, bioactive diet pill," Obritsch said.

JUDGE'S INITIAL RULING FAVORS IRVINE FIRM OVER COLDWELL BANKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A small, Irvine-based commercial real estate firm has won a preliminary victory 
in an effort to obtain a commission of more than $400,000 from Coldwell Banker 
Commercial Real Estate Services, one of the nation's largest real estate 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
In a tentative decision Monday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lester 
E. Olson ruled that Lee &amp; Associates was due half of a $600,000 commission 
that was paid to Coldwell Banker in 1983 and 1984, plus interest. The total 
exceeds $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
The disputed commission was paid to Coldwell on a 10-year, $15-million lease 
that Hughes Aircraft Co. signed in 1982 for research and development space at 
the Canyon Corporate Center in Anaheim. The complex is owned by the Macklin 
Co., a Newport Beach-based developer. 
</P>
<P>
The court is expected to issue a final judgment this fall. Coldwell has 
objected to the court findings, claiming that many of Judge Olson's findings in 
the case are ambiguous or wrong. Coldwell attorney Wallace Rosvall refused 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lee &amp; Associates sued Coldwell in 1984, claiming that the giant real estate 
firm had unfairly taken all of the commission after Hughes rented the 
365,000-square-foot space from Macklin. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Macklin hired Coldwell to peddle the property in 
1982. Coldwell then sent out descriptions to other area brokers to find out 
whether they had any prospective tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks later, Lee &amp; Associates broker Thomas Casey mentioned to a 
Coldwell broker at an open house that Hughes might have some interest in the 
Anaheim property. Then, through a series of telephone calls and meetings, Casey 
helped Coldwell arrange a negotiating session with Hughes representatives that 
eventually turned into a deal, the judge found. 
</P>
<P>
In similar cases in Orange County, the commission is usually split in half, but 
Coldwell illegally refused to pay, Judge Olson ruled. Hughes has a rule that 
requires its representatives to deal only with the principal broker, which in 
this case was Coldwell. 
</P>
<P>
Though Coldwell offered to pay Lee &amp; Associates a referral fee, the company 
turned it down, saying that half the commission was owed. The firm also turned 
down a proposed $30,000 settlement in 1988, said Ed Broffman, an attorney who 
represented Lee.

SOME TIPS ON HANDLING THAT POSSESSIVE FORMER HUSBAND OR LOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SILLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there appear to be considerably 
fewer techniques for getting your lover to leave you. Sometimes your ex, the 
man you think of as firmly in your past, keeps intruding on your present. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps he keeps calling you, pouring out his loneliness, his pain. He wants to 
discuss the relationship endlessly. You feel compassionate and maybe a little 
bit guilty. You try to cut the conversations short, but he won't let you go. 
And he won't stop calling. 
</P>
<P>
Or, he has moved out, but he still acts as if your home is his. He drops by 
unexpectedly, lingers when he brings the kids back. Only outright rudeness can 
dislodge him. 
</P>
<P>
Some men hang on by doing you favors. Somehow, he's still picking your car up 
at the shop or volunteering to straighten out your taxes. Somehow these 
kindnesses end up including dinner or a movie. You think you've told him 
clearly that the relationship is over. He says, "Yes, dear," and goes right on 
acting as if nothing has changed. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the worst case is the man who stays around to vent his anger. This 
man may call to criticize you, may bang on the door if you refuse to receive 
him. He makes scenes, insults you, even threatens you. He can be a frightening 
presence in your life. 
</P>
<P>
What's the problem? Why won't these men let go? In most situations, an ex who 
hangs on is a man who does not understand or will not accept the limits of the 
new relationship. Your role is to define those limits, loudly, clearly and 
firmly. 
</P>
<P>
There are three possible problems with limit-setting which may create a 
situation where your ex-lover won't leave you alone: 
</P>
<P>
You haven't set any clear limits. Maybe you have mixed feelings about letting 
go, so you make it possible for him to hang on. 
</P>
<P>
You have set limits, but he misunderstands the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
He deliberately, probably angrily, flouts the limits you've set. 
</P>
<P>
You haven't set limits. On the one hand, you think you have made it clear that 
you are no longer a couple. On the other hand, you don't want to let go 
completely. Doesn't it seem reasonable that the two of you remain friends? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it does, depending upon what role this friend plays in your life and what 
role you are expected to play in his. When this relationship begins to 
interfere with new relationships you might form, or with your peace of mind, 
you will have to set a much firmer limit. 
</P>
<P>
A man who continues to do you favors is a man who is still involved with your 
life. Eventually, he may be a man who wants to know where you were last night. 
If you continue to accept his help, you continue to receive his love. What are 
you willing to give back or give up in exchange? 
</P>
<P>
When you make a break, you have to give up the benefits of the relationship. 
It's tough, because you may be totally on your own and it's tempting to be 
taken care of -- even by a man you've decided to let go. It's tough on him too, 
because he is less likely to move on to a new woman while he is still focused 
on you. For some of us, that hold is an unconscious motivator. We don't want 
him but a small part of us doesn't want anyone else to have him either. So we 
keep control by letting him hang on. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is to bite the bullet and say no to the favors. It's a short-term 
inconvenience in order to allow both of you to move on with your lives. 
</P>
<P>
When the situation is reversed, and he is the one asking you for some 
attention, limit-setting may be even more difficult. After all, you rejected 
him. Aren't you at least obligated to take his phone calls or continue to 
advise him on his wardrobe? Perhaps -- up to a point. That point is reached 
when his requests feel uncomfortable, intrusive or burdensome to you. Then it 
is time to say a firm, clear, albeit gentle "no." You might say, "I understand 
that you are hurting, but I'm not the right person to discuss this with," or, 
"I'm not comfortable helping you in this way anymore." You might even have to 
say, "Please don't call me anymore. I don't think it's good for either of us." 
</P>
<P>
Limit-setting is difficult because it forces you to make a choice when you 
probably have mixed feelings. But only a clear choice will allow you both to 
move on. 
</P>
<P>
You have a misunderstanding about the limits. This is most often the case when 
you have children and are therefore required to have an ongoing relationship. 
You both wish that relationship would be an amiable one, but you might easily 
have different expectations of what is proper ex-husband behavior. His vaguely 
possessive air, as if you are still his wife or this is still his home, may 
infuriate you. It feels as if he is deliberately intrusive. Maybe he is. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe this is just his version of cordiality. When he picks up the kids or 
calls you to discuss a problem, he has a difficult psychological task. He has 
to behave in an old familiar situation in some new, unfamiliar way. Without 
some guidance, he is likely to fail miserably. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being instantly antagonistic, you might try helping him figure out a 
new way to act. You have to clarify your expectations, let him know what you 
are comfortable with. Find out what his needs are too, and what would make his 
visits easier on him.

WHERE EXPECTATIONS ARE LOW, A BRONX SCHOOL BUILDS HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL W. BAKER, Christian Science Monitor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the aftermath of a brutal attack by a roving gang of youths on a Central 
Park jogger, another group of youths, coming from far tougher circumstances 
than the assailants, met to discuss the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all said the perpetrators should face severe punishment; some called for 
castration or the electric chair. But there was also a mature and sober 
analysis: Youngsters spoke of a tremendous anger harbored by many ghetto youths 
who come to an early realization that America's "Land of Opportunity" has no 
place for them. 
</P>
<P>
The 15- to 21-year-old participants in the discussion groups are the students 
at Argus Community Alternative High School in the South Bronx, and they know of 
what they speak. They are kids who dropped out -- or were thrown out -- of 
other schools, or who have drug, alcohol or behavior problems. Others, although 
they are just kids themselves, are already parents. 
</P>
<P>
Most come from broken homes and a cycle of unemployment and poverty where the 
only opportunity -- one that promises gold jewelry and fancy cars -- seems to 
come from selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
For them, Argus may be the last stop: The last chance to learn to read, and the 
last chance for educators and counselors to breathe direction and hope into 
their lives. It is also an example worthy of examination because at a time of 
massive failures by the educational system, Argus works. 
</P>
<P>
The school, which was transformed two years ago from a conventional school 
curriculum to the more creative format of an "alternative" school, has in the 
past year seen attendance rates double and the number of high school graduation 
equivalency (GED) certificates awarded quadruple. Of 89 students who have gone 
through vocational training in the last 16 months, 60 are working full time. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, Argus is succeeding in socializing youths who 
constantly face peer pressure to commit acts that harm themselves and others. 
The park attack was not some abstract event to Argus students. "There was a 
student here who could have gone with those kids," Adolfo Ripley said. "He 
decided to stay home." 
</P>
<P>
Adolfo himself transferred from another high school where he says he was 
"hanging out with the wrong crowd, doing drugs, drinking, cutting classes." On 
a recent day at Argus, he was having an amiable chat with a counselor as he 
prepared for a job interview. 
</P>
<P>
Observers attribute the school's success to a variety of factors. Stephen 
Phillips, the superintendent of alternative high schools and programs, credits 
"an excellent, individualized format that leads to continuous progress for 
students." Much of that, he says, is due to the effective therapeutic and 
counseling programs provided by the private Argus Community agency in which the 
school is housed. 
</P>
<P>
The school places great emphasis on treating each of the more than 150 students 
as an individual of importance. "The kids get a lot of personal attention," 
says Hope Eisman, who runs the school. "I know every kid in this building, and 
every kid knows me." 
</P>
<P>
Students also benefit from small class size and a creative, flexible curriculum 
based largely on their input. "We're very concerned with talking with kids, 
listening to kids, and implementing the kinds of programs kids say they need," 
Eisman says. 
</P>
<P>
Positive and negative reinforcement are key factors. Elaborate incentive 
programs show the students that good things do indeed come from good work. 
Rules and regulations are clearly enumerated; disciplinary measures are 
designed to fit the transgression, with peer censure being central. 
</P>
<P>
Argus' students are referred by other schools and social service agencies, but 
they come to Argus voluntarily. To make it easy for the youths to attend, the 
school provides breakfast, lunch, car fare and child care. 
</P>
<P>
Most seem to be keenly aware that they are treading the margin between a life 
of despair and one of possibilities. "I'm 20 -- I don't have no more time left. 
I have to get my diploma and get out," says Celinda Bates, who is studying for 
the GED test and hopes to go to college to prepare for a business career. She 
says at her previous high school, she felt no one cared whether she graduated. 
But at Argus, "They make sure you get what you came here for." 
</P>
<P>
Celinda and other students say they benefit from encouragement in an 
unstructured atmosphere. She particularly enjoys working with computers, thanks 
largely to instructor Stephen Chesterson's approach. "If they want to do work 
other than the assigned work, I let them," he says. In his classroom, the 
printers are just as likely to be cranking out poems and holiday cards as 
graphs. 
</P>
<P>
Another striking aspect of the teaching style at Argus is the willingness of 
the teachers to eliminate formality. Art teacher Terry Brody, dressed in hippie 
garb, is busy wisecracking, giving bear hugs and rapping with the students. He 
intersperses history, math and science as he shows individual students the 
finer points of working with a paintbrush. 
</P>
<P>
Eisman rewards attendance and academic performance with everything from 
official recognition, T-shirts and pizza parties to her "Good News Tea," a 
formal ceremony complete with silver tea service, to which students and their 
parents are invited. 
</P>
<P>
With students constantly under pressure to take the easy step into delinquency, 
Argus puts a premium on talk and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Regular group discussions allow the youths to speak their minds and serve as a 
means of controlling behavior through positive peer pressure. Staff members say 
the most effective way to punish troublemakers is to require that they 
apologize to a group of fellow students for having let them down. 
</P>
<P>
Students are constantly and individually coached and watched for signs of 
problems. All of the teachers double as academic counselors, and the host Argus 
Community provides vocational and drug counselors who are themselves former 
substance abusers. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the impressive results so far, Eisman is planning new programs that 
students have requested. One will be a "sciences institute" for college-bound 
students to increase awareness of health and medical careers. 
</P>
<P>
Also under consideration is a "business institute," which will involve 
youngsters in running an actual small business. Although most Argus students 
come from neighborhoods where the ownership of a business is nothing more than 
a shimmering dream, some have already demonstrated a ready acumen for handling 
money: A team of students in Argus' "college bound" program recently won second 
prize in a citywide stock market simulation, making a symbolic bundle on Wall 
Street while edging out teams from schools in some of the city's wealthiest 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
As for Adolfo Ripley, he's looking forward to starting his first job soon, as a 
mail room employee at the world-famous Carnegie Hall.

NEW YORK LEADS NATION IN ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL W. BAKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York City's alternative school system is unique in terms of its variety, 
scope and longevity. City alternative programs date from the 19th Century, 
although the bulk came into existence in the early 1970s. Alternative schools 
and programs at 130 sites currently serve 22,000 students, 10% of New York City 
high school pupils. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't found anything elsewhere that is even a fraction of that," says 
Stephen Phillips, New York's superintendent for alternative high schools and 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Argus Community School is not just an alternative school. It is also an 
"off-site" school, operating from the premises of the Argus Community, a 
20-year-old private, nonprofit agency providing intensive counseling, 
vocational training, and work experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Our success in running these schools is attributable to the community 
organizations," Mr. Phillips says. He credits much of the school's success to 
the support structure set up by Argus Community's president, Elizabeth Sturz. 
</P>
<P>
The New York school system pays the teachers; the agency, which is funded by 
city and state agencies and private grants, pays the counselors. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of merging schools with social agency services is growing; there 
are 53 Offsite Educational Services locations in New York. By September, it is 
expected that there will be 67 such sites in operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're the only school system in the world that sends teachers to all 
sorts of social service agencies," Phillips says. "We go to where the students 
are." That includes running classes for homeless children in the hotels that 
serve as temporary housing, and in prisons. RUSSELL W. BAKER

Actor Rob Lowe's insurance company says his home and personal liability 
insurance policy doesn't cover sex tapes, and it wants a judge to free it of 
any obligation for claims if Lowe has to pay damages in a lawsuit over his 
alleged videotaping of a sex act involving a teen-age girl. Chubb Custom 
Insurance Co. of New Jersey filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in 
Atlanta, saying Lowe's policy doesn't cover "intentional actions" such as using 
"celebrity status as an inducement to females to engage in sexual intercourse, 
sodomy and multiple party sexual activity for his immediate sexual 
gratification and for the purpose of making pornographic films." ALEENE MacMINN

Tonight at Anaheim's Pearson Park Amphitheatre, two of the most mischievous 
Peters in children's literature will offer a twirling, whirling lesson in 
obedience in "The Hilarious Tales of Peter Rabbit" and "Peter and the Wolf," 
presented by the Laguna Beach-based Ballet Pacifica. The ballets for children, 
which run about 25 minutes each, will begin at 7:30 on the outdoor stage as 
part of Pearson Park's annual summer season of entertainment. There will be one 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
According to Molly Lynch, Ballet Pacifica's artistic director, both ballets 
feature a traditional but simplified retelling of the classic tales. "Peter 
Rabbit" tells of the fuzzy fellow's exploits in Mr. McGregor's garden, where -- 
despite his mother's warnings -- he lunches on stolen carrots and barely 
escapes joining the vegetables in the farmer's stew pot. In "Peter and the 
Wolf," a headstrong boy ignores the old folks and ventures too far into the 
woods, where he encounters a foul-tempered wolf with an undiscriminating 
appetite. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few detours, mostly in the interest of pint-sized sensibilities, 
Lynch said. For example, in the original version of "Peter and the Wolf," a 
hapless duck is eaten by the wolf, never to be seen again. Ballet Pacifica 
gives the duck a reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
"In our version, the wolf swallows the duck whole, but later, in all the 
excitement, he opens his mouth so wide the duck just flies out. We didn't want 
to upset the kids," said Lynch. Both ballets are appropriate for children ages 
3 and older, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Former Ballet Pacifica dancers Dan Berney and Corinne Calamaro created the 
choreography for "The Hilarious Tales of Peter Rabbit." The simple but colorful 
sets are by Charles Johnston. (Johnston is a busy guy; he also dances the roles 
of McGregor in "Peter Rabbit" and Grandfather in "Peter and the Wolf.") Lila 
Zali, founder and past director of Ballet Pacifica, created the costumes. The 
taped score featured selections by Leo Delibes, the 19th-Century Romantic 
composer best known for his operas and ballets. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter and the Wolf" features the familiar score by 20th-Century Russian 
composer Sergei Prokofiev. Choreography and costumes are by Zali, with sets by 
Tania Barton. 
</P>
<P>
Both ballets were performed in May as part of Ballet Pacifica's 1988-89 
Children's Series, a four-part season of children's ballets that began in 1978. 
(Tonight's performance is at the invitation of Anaheim's Parks and Recreation 
Department.) Next season's Children's Series opens Oct. 28 at Laguna's Festival 
Forum Theatre with "Ghouls and Goblins" and a new adaptation of "Puss and 
Boots." In March, the company will present a new work based on the tales of 
"Winnie the Pooh." 
</P>
<P>
Ballet Pacifica also stages a four-part Concert Series each year for adult 
audiences, blending traditional dance with more innovative works. The company 
also presents dance lectures and demonstrations to area schools and community 
groups through the Center Dance Alliance, a support group of the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at our Children's Series and lectures as something that's really 
beneficial to the community," said Lynch. "Our Concert Series is very 
important, but you have to keep working on the educational element of dance. 
You have to strike the right balance." 
</P>
<P>
With most grade-schoolers better versed in Nintendo than Nureyev, does Lynch 
have any trouble attracting youngsters to a performance of -- eeek! -- 
classical dance? 
</P>
<P>
"I think exposing children to ballet at an early age is really important, 
whether it helps them develop appreciation of it as an audience member or makes 
them want to get involved in it themselves," said Lynch, who, coincidentally, 
began her own training under Lila Zali at age 6. "So we try to make our ballets 
high quality and somewhat educational." 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean they can't have a little fun too. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids really got into it," Lynch said. "I think it's the combination of 
good, classical music, the colors, the costumes, the movement. . . . It's all 
attractive to them." Not to mention the audience participation. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a character will go out among the kids, and that's pretty exciting," 
she added. "For example, at the end of 'Peter and the Wolf,' the hunters take 
the wolf off to the zoo and they go through the audience. Some of the kids will 
scream; others will sit there with their eyes wide open, just staring at him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so real to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ballet Pacifica presents "The Hilarious Tales of Peter Rabbit" and "Peter and 
the Wolf" tonight at 7:30 in the Pearson Park Amphitheatre. Tickets are $2 for 
adults, $1 for senior citizens (over 50) and children 12 and under. Festival 
seating. A snack bar is available. The amphitheater is on Lemon Street between 
Lincoln and Sycamore in Anaheim. Information: (714) 999-5191.

<P>
THE EROTICISM OF 'PICNIC' SEEMS TOO QUAINT TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Picnic" has spent the last 35 years evolving into a piece of sweaty kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
William Inge's tale of the sexual awakening of Madge, a flower in the dreamy 
fields of America's heartland, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1953, mainly because of 
its frank erotic identity. But what was hot then -- the drama's female 
characters swooned at the sight of big-shouldered, small-brained Hal's 
perspiring torso, and the audience's women were expected to do the same -- 
seems lukewarm and even silly these days. "Picnic," once something of a symbol 
of liberation, now has the look of self-conscious satire. 
</P>
<P>
At the Garden Grove Community Theatre, director Josh Mowery keeps faith with 
the notion that it tells an important story. For the most part, this is a 
serious interpretation that tends to underscore the play's antique quality. 
Mowery occasionally seems to josh wryly with "Picnic's" attitudes and tone, 
especially in the scenes between old-maid schoolteacher Rosemary and reluctant 
beau Howard, but it's not enough to lift it above itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Picnic" begins with Hal (Jeffrey Orman), a hunky drifter who just days before 
was rolled by two women he had taken to bed, doing some yardwork around the 
rural Kansas homes of Flo Owens (Corrine Williams) and Helen Potts (Alene 
Duncan Hyatt). As he bends this way and that, muscles working overtime, the 
local women get hot and bothered -- apparently, studs are rare around these 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
Madge (Cheryl Lawson) is checking him out, too. But she's involved, in a naive, 
pristine way, with Alan (Walter B. Durant), an affable square who happened to 
go to college with Hal. Madge tries to keep her cool, but the hormones are 
percolating. "Picnic" is on its primly suggestive way. 
</P>
<P>
As Hal, Orman is reasonably jovial and unassuming about all the havoc he's 
creating with the ladies. His strutting bravado even has an amusing edge that 
helps lighten the archness of it all. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson's Madge, however, is not much more than ingenue sighs and little whines. 
We get a notion that she wants something, but for all the clues that are given, 
it could be a cherry soda down at the drugstore. To her credit, Lawson does 
work up a lot of interest when she sidles into her Kim Novak dance that signals 
a broader dimension in her courtship with Hal. 
</P>
<P>
This production scores most of its points with Shirlene Peterson Joseph as 
Rosemary and Joshua Kaye as Howard. Their moments have personality and humor, 
two elements that can refresh "Picnic" and keep it from becoming a bloated 
experience. 
</P>
<P>

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: VOLUNTEERISM TAKES A MUSICAL TURN IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Instead of a thousand points of light, an Irvine social work student named 
James Lovell has decided to transform volunteerism into a few thousand watts of 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
Lovell, 20, has merged his interest in the local rock music scene with his 
desire to do charitable work by launching Spare Change, a new organization 
devoted to putting on benefit shows that will showcase Orange County rock music 
talent. Lovell, a senior at Christ College, a Lutheran school in Irvine, will 
inaugurate his project Saturday night with a five-band charity bill at the 
Saddleback Valley Board of Realtors Hall in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my volunteer work," he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The varied lineup includes funk band Jerrasound, hard rockers the End and 
Shuttup, Purple Shake, a psychedelic group, and the Slugs, who play new wave 
rock. The show starts at 7 p.m. at the Realtors Hall, 25552 La Paz Ave. 
Proceeds will go to the Interfaith Christian Assistance Network, which sponsors 
drug education programs, and LIFE (Love Is Feeding Everyone), a Los Angeles 
group that helps feed the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been going to shows since I was 13, all different styles," Lovell said 
Wednesday. "I think it's great to see new talent. It's the new talent that does 
something different." 
</P>
<P>
Lovell's goals for Spare Change are to highlight the work of local bands (which 
will all be donating their services), to raise money for good causes, and to 
prod the conscience of young rock fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Laguna Hills, where this show is taking place, is an affluent area," Lovell 
said. "I want the kids who listen to that kind of music to realize there are 
people who go with a lot less and need some help." 
</P>
<P>
Lovell said he is using his own money to cover the show's overhead costs: $900 
for renting the 299-capacity hall and taking out insurance. Tickets to the 
benefit, which Lovell has dubbed "Regaining Consciousness," cost $10, with a $2 
discount to concert-goers who bring two canned food items. Information: (714) 
854-6764. 
</P>
<P>
FIRST SOLO: Chameleon Records has scheduled a September release for "Ward One: 
Along the Way," the first solo album by former Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward, 
who lives in Seal Beach. It's a concept album, in which Ward combines heavy 
metal with progressive rock touches as he chronicles the life-or-death struggle 
with alcoholism that followed his ascent to rock stardom. 
</P>
<P>
Ward's old Black Sabbath buddy, Ozzy Osbourne, appears as guest lead singer on 
two tracks, "Bombers" and "Jack's Land" -- with "Bombers" a fine, rumbling, 
dark-hued rocker that Ozzy's fans shouldn't miss (Osbourne headlines tonight at 
Irvine Meadows). Cream's singer, Jack Bruce, also makes a guest appearance on 
the album. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent Billboard magazine tribute to Osbourne, Ward recalled his friend's 
reaction upon first hearing "Pink Clouds an Island," a Pink Floyd-ish track 
from Ward's album: Osbourne physically and verbally attacked Ward, "all of 
which is his way of saying he liked what he heard." 
</P>
<P>
WASTELAND: Music Connection magazine decided to survey the Orange County music 
scene in its July 24 -- Aug. 6 issue. Apparently, according to record label 
talent scouts queried by the magazine, there's no there there (or, from our 
viewpoint, no here here) when it comes to music-making. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's Orange County?" wonders Bret Hartman, A&amp;R representative for MCA 
Records. Says Mio Vukovic, of Geffen Records: "A few of our bands play down 
there, such as Little Caesar and Junkyard, but now it's almost like a wasteland 
down there. And there really isn't much young talent in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Such comments are par for the course from creatures of a corporate, 
multinational music industry that's geared more to watching the bottom line 
than to following its ears. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that it's better, at least from a creative standpoint, for local 
bands to be ignored by big-label A&amp;R folk who want to mold everything they 
touch into the next Guns N' Roses. The better Orange County bands -- and there 
are many of them -- are finding their own ways to play, rather than gearing 
their output to the tastes of big-label scouts trained to think like bankers 
rather than as seekers of passionate, adventurous music. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Junkyard, the sort of workaday clone-of-Aerosmith hard-rock band that the 
L.A. scene churns out like so much ear fodder, is Mr. Vukovic's idea of 
promising young talent. 
</P>
<P>
I'll stick with the creative locals you've been reading about regularly in this 
space, even if they aren't something the big labels can sell by the bushel. 
</P>
<P>
DIVERSIFICATION: Dr. Dream, the Orange-based record company that is home to a 
good many of those creative locals, is throwing a bash this weekend to 
celebrate its diversification into the record shop business. 
</P>
<P>
The store, like Dr. Dream's roster of bands, is geared to alternative music 
tastes. Grand opening festivities will take place Saturday and Sunday from 1 
p.m. to 5 p.m., with in-shop acoustic performances by the Swamp Zombies, 
Eggplant and Imagining Yellow Suns, as well as free food and drink, prizes, and 
storewide merchandise discounts. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dream Records (the store) is located at 60 Plaza Square in Orange, below 
its parent label's offices. 
</P>
<P>
ENDINGS: The Movement, a San Clemente-based pop-rock band that got some 
exposure last year with a self-released album and soundtrack work for surfing 
shows, has called it quits over musical disagreements within the group. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to play hard-edged, more guitar-oriented, stronger music," said Steve 
Clifton, the Movement's singer. "Some other people in the band wanted to go a 
little more sophisticated, and others wanted to go acoustic." 
</P>
<P>
Clifton said he is forming a new band called Joyriders with three transplanted 
Londoners -- not to be confused with Joyride, another new group being launched 
by former Adolescents Steve Soto and Sandy Hansen.

TENANTS FIGHT RENT HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tenant association of Park Santa Anita mobile home park has asked the city 
to review a rent increase by the park owners. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of about 40 homes in the park were granted a reprieve in May when 
the Pasadena Superior court issued a temporary restraining order blocking the 
rent increase. But Judge Melvin B. Grover voided the order July 21 because 
there were alternate remedies the tenants could pursue, such as asking the city 
to mediate, said Bob Bulison, attorney for the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Under a Monrovia ordinance adopted in February, the city manager can block 
excessive rent increases if a mobile home park is closing and is more than 25% 
vacant, said City Atty. Rick Morillo. 
</P>
<P>
Morillo, who received a rent review request from the tenants Monday, said the 
city manager must set a hearing within 15 days and decide within 30 days of the 
filing if the new rate of $350 per month exceeds fair market value. Rents at 
the park range from $180 to $250.

The residential southwestern corner of Costa Mesa is a neighborhood that can, 
and does, cause confusion, even for some people who live there. For in the less 
than one square mile bordered on the north and south by Victoria and 19th 
streets, respectively, on the east by Placentia Avenue and the west by the 
Santa Ana River are segments of two different cities. 
</P>
<P>
Ask someone on the street if this is the Newport Terrace area and most likely 
he'll reply, "You're mistaken, this is Costa Mesa." That's largely true. 
</P>
<P>
But a small pocket bordering on 19th Street adjacent to Talbert Regional Park 
is actually a part of Newport Beach. Newport Terrace is so far removed from the 
rest of Newport Beach and so nearly surrounded by Costa Mesa that it's easy to 
understand why even the locals sometimes get confused. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Terrace is a small pocket of relative affluence, boxed in by environs 
of need. As is true of many other areas in Orange County, a couple of blocks 
can make a tremendous difference in look and style. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of the eastern section of the neighborhood are marked by the signs of 
urban wear, age, and in some cases, decay or neglect. Nearly two blocks of 
Victoria Street stand boarded. And according to the city there are no projects 
planned that will make any difference. Would-be front lawns serve as parking 
lots and crammed garages yawn lazily open, revealing their loads of every 
imaginable kind of household detritus. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the oil wells along 19th Street, steadily pumping along their 
elevated terrain, with greenery all about, that are the tip-off of the 
differences to come. Balboa Boulevard, the aorta of Newport Terrace, may be a 
cul de sac, but it's also the entry into a different kind of living. Shiny new, 
expensive cars and well-manicured lawns signal a life style unlike that to the 
east and north. Designer jogging suits seem the uniform of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-acre Newport Terrace Condominiums are the most prominent residential 
feature along Balboa. And in the unreal world of Orange County real estate, 
they represent something of an oasis of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"This complex is the only property left in Newport Beach under $200,000," says 
Fred Nicastro, broker for Century 21 in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Prices start at $160,000 and, depending on the luxuries requested, level off 
around $190,000. At the heart of the complex is a 10-acre greenbelt with de 
rigueur amenities such as playground, barbecue and picnic areas, a full-size 
swimming pool, wading pool for children, and a Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Vollmer of Management Service Co., managers of the complex, explains that 
the condominiums were built in five phases, with the first completed in June, 
1974, and the fifth on May 1, 1979. First-phase owners paid prices ranging from 
$37,450 to $43,950. 
</P>
<P>
According to Corinne Schlott, president of the homeowners' association, more 
than just the price of the units has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"When I moved into my condo in 1985, there was a 55% tenant occupancy rate. Now 
owners are living in their properties, making it 55% owner-occupied. We 
attribute this change to the increase of value of these properties." 
</P>
<P>
Those owners and other residents are now waiting for the results of a survey 
seeking to determine their feelings about development of the land along 19th 
Street. Everyone was asked to state a preference: would residents like to see 
single-family homes, apartments, townhouses, a light industrial center, or 
would they prefer that the remnant wetland remain the way it is? Results are 
not yet available, according to Schlott. 
</P>
<P>
The most striking natural attraction here is the Talbert Regional Park site at 
the western edge of the neighborhood. It is part of a 136-acre grassy and hilly 
plot the county purchased May 17, 1977, from the State Mutual Savings &amp; 
Loan Assn. for $2.1 million, according to Grace Secketa of the program planning 
division of the Environmental Management Agency -- Harbors, Beaches and Parks. 
Some of the area south of Victoria Street will remain wilderness, but exactly 
which areas and how much is the subject of a study now in progress and 
scheduled to be completed in mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
Although the site is not yet ready for public use, it is sure to become a 
considerable lure for neighborhood residents and naturalists. Its grove of 
mature willow trees (the biggest in the county), large pond and wetlands 
provide a haven where egrets and great blue herons live and breed. 
</P>
<P>
It is a place where the two cities will be able to come together, yet not 
collide.

COLLEGE OF DESIGN TO EXPAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Art Center College of Design has won the city's approval of a master plan 
that will permit it to enlarge its classroom space by 50,000 square feet and 
add parking for 200 cars. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Jernigan, executive vice president of the college, said construction 
could begin this fall. He said changing technology has forced the college to 
devote more space to computer equipment, creating a classroom shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents near the college have worried that the proposed construction 
could be a forerunner of more extensive development. 
</P>
<P>
"What some neighbors are afraid of is that we intend to expand," Jernigan said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the college operates under a city permit that limits full-time 
enrollment to 1,500 students and no more than 1,250 may be on campus at any one 
time. The college has 1,000 full-time students in its summer session and up to 
1,200 during the remainder of the year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose in life is not to be big but to be the best design school in the 
world," Jernigan said.

RTD SEEKS RULING CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two RTD unions have asked a judge to reconsider a ruling that allowed the 
Foothill Transit Zone to expand bus service in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Eli Chernow has postponed the effective date of his July 
decision from this week to Aug. 11, but will probably make his final decision 
by Friday, said William P. Forsythe, Foothill Transit's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Chernow ruled that Foothill Transit, a joint operation of 20 area 
cities and the county, was legal. Unions representing 7,000 Southern California 
Rapid Transit District drivers and mechanics challenged the transit zone's 
creation, arguing that it threatened union jobs and was an illegal breakup of 
the RTD. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill was approved by the county Transportation Commission, which oversees 
county transportation policy, in late 1987 as a low-cost alternative to the 
RTD. Since December, Foothill has operated two express routes from Diamond Bar 
and Glendora to downtown Los Angeles at lower fares than the RTD had charged. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the precedent-setting case had political overtones and presented 
novel questions of jurisdiction, Chernow originally stayed his decision for two 
weeks to allow for an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill hopes to take over up to 20 of the RTD's San Gabriel Valley lines by 
mid-1990, and was expected to enlarge its service by adding five local lines at 
the end of August.

A NEW 710 FREEWAY WILL BRING NO TRAFFIC BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The evidence is starting to come in and be heard. The completion of the 710 
Freeway will not only be devastating and destructive, but will not 
substantially relieve any traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
New transportation studies show that if the 710 Freeway is completed through El 
Sereno, Pasadena and South Pasadena, it will operate at level "F" the day it is 
completed. That means "severe congestion." The same studies show, if the 
freeway link is completed, it will increase the amount of traffic on the 210 
Freeway, the San Bernardino Freeway and California Boulevard, which is a main 
thoroughfare through Pasadena. More traffic, more congestion! 
</P>
<P>
In a recent article by White House Fellow Richard Sybert, he called for 
charging fees for usage of highways during peak hours. He also wisely pointed 
out we need more parks, trees, schoolyards and public places, not more concrete 
and fumes. The 710 extension will destroy 7,000 trees and run side-by-side with 
three schoolyards where children will live and breathe high concentrations of 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Even top transportation bureaucrats understand the future lies in alternative 
solutions to relieving congestion, not paving our way out of it. Caltrans 
Director Robert Best recently said: "In Los Angeles, there's no more room for 
new freeways, and the next advance has to be technological." U.S. Secretary of 
Transportation Samuel Skinner is currently involved in a massive public 
outreach program. He's touting double-decking existing freeways in L.A. and 
high-speed methods of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Transportation expert Martin Wachs estimates the 710 extension may cost 
more than $1 billion, possibly $3 billion or $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans will tell you the cost is $425 million. They continue this low-ball 
figure in order not to alarm taxpayers. It's basing its numbers on ancient 
history. All it need do is look at the Century Freeway and the 
billion-dollar-plus price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra Mayor Michael Blanco and L.A. City Councilman Richard Alatorre are 
encouraging San Gabriel Valley cities to support a freeway through their 
neighborhoods. Alatorre is vehemently for this freeway despite the destruction 
to low-cost housing in his East Los Angeles community. He has not been 
responsive to grass-roots opposition. Blanco believes Alhambra's traffic 
congestion problems will be alleviated, but studies show the relief will be 
temporary. 
</P>
<P>
There must be alternative solutions to easing traffic congestion rather than 
uprooting lives, bulldozing homes and trees and destroying neighborhoods.

POLICE REVIEW PLAN GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ballot proposal that would create a citizen review board to deal with 
complaints of police brutality and misconduct was approved this week by a key 
City Council committee. 
</P>
<P>
The action clears the way for the proposal to go before the full council, which 
must vote to put it on next April's ballot for a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which requires a change in the City Charter, would for the first 
time take the authority to investigate complaints of police brutality away from 
the Police Department and put it in the hands of an 11-member citizen board 
appointed by the mayor and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
By a 6-3 vote, the Charter Amendment Committee, on which all members of the 
council sit, approved a final version of the plan. Council members Jan Hall, 
Les Robbins and Jeffrey Kellogg voted no. Vice Mayor Wallace Edgerton, who had 
voted against the ballot proposal at an earlier meeting of the charter 
committee, voted for it Tuesday night. He said that he had received numerous 
calls from people in his district asking him to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to his earlier opposition, Edgerton said: "I believe I missed the 
mark in my community. . . . They want to put it on the ballot."

RENEWAL STUDY ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has ordered a study to determine whether neighborhoods along 
Long Beach Boulevard and Atlantic Avenue should be declared redevelopment 
zones. 
</P>
<P>
The study area, running roughly from Anaheim Street to the Signal Hill border 
and the San Diego Freeway, is somewhat blighted. There are many vacant lots; 
some longtime auto dealerships on Long Beach Boulevard will move to the city's 
new auto mall when it opens, and light rail construction has disrupted some 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
If parts of the area are eventually included in redevelopment zones, the city 
Redevelopment Agency could condemn property, buy land and sell it to businesses 
to encourage commercial or residential development.

<P>
Three community colleges in the area will receive more than $500,000 each in 
computer equipment and training from IBM Corp. to start a high-tech computer 
program on their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
A press briefing will be held at 10 a.m. today at the World Trade Center to 
explain the programs planned for Cerritos, El Camino and Irvine Valley 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to develop computer-integrated tools and techniques to keep U.S. 
manufacturing competitive. 
</P>
<P>
The three community colleges are the first in Southern California to form such 
a partnership with IBM, said Mark Wallace, Cerritos College director of 
information. Nationwide, 57 two- and four-year colleges are participating in 
the program, he said.

HELP FOR YOUNG MOTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica College has launched a program to encourage teen-age mothers to 
stay in school, or return if they have dropped out, and provides them with 
financial assistance, counseling and child-care help. 
</P>
<P>
Five mothers, ranging in age from 16 to 18, started classes at the college this 
summer. They will be able to earn both high school and college credit for some 
of the classes, said counselor John Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
The students were recruited from the School-Age Parenting and Infant 
Development Program, a year-old program at Olympic High School in Santa Monica. 
Some of the mothers will get their high school diplomas at the college, and 
others are enrolled at the college and at Olympic High concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
Most teen-age mothers take a lot of time out from school to have their babies, 
said Tina Feiger, coordinator of the program, which is named "On the Move." 
</P>
<P>
"The longer you stay out of school, the harder it is to get back into it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the program, the students can "pick up some high school credits and get 
experience at the college," Feiger said. "It makes them feel like grown-ups, to 
be in a college class. . . . They feel respected as adults." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica College has helped arrange for private and state-subsidized child 
care, offered parenting classes, waived registration fees and given each mother 
$100 for supplies, Feiger said. Three more students are expected to join the 
program in the fall, she said.

SNAVELY SENTENCING DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sentencing of South Gate Councilman Odell L. Snavely for harboring two teen-age 
girls at his toy store when he knew they should have been in school has been 
postponed until Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Commissioner J. Francis Spelman last week allowed Snavely to 
change lawyers and gave the new attorney, Walter R. Urban, time to acquaint 
himself with the case. 
</P>
<P>
Snavely pleaded no contest in February to two misdemeanor charges of 
contributing to the truancy of a minor. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department conducted a six-month investigation of the councilman 
after two South Gate Junior High School girls, ages 13 and 14, said Snavely 
touched them on the breasts while they were working at his business. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Sheriff's Department report, which is part of Snavely's court 
file, four girls claimed they had been molested by Snavely, who paid them to 
help clean his store. 
</P>
<P>
Snavely has denied molesting anyone. He said the girls fabricated the 
accusations to distract from the theft of some jewelry from his store. He said 
he threatened to report them for truancy unless they returned the jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth Freeman did not object to the continuance. He has 
recommended that Snavely serve a year in jail and a five-year probation.

The deaths of 17 bicyclists on Orange County city streets and roads last year 
was the second highest annual total during the last five years and an increase 
of six from the year before. The cities of Anaheim, Huntington Beach and Irvine 
had the most fatalities, with three each. Several cities had no bike deaths on 
their streets. Cypress, Fountain Valley, La Palma, Los Alamitos, Orange, San 
Juan Capistrano and Seal Beach have recorded no such deaths during any of the 
last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's 17 biker deaths ranked it second among it and the four 
contiguous counties. Los Angeles County led with 33, followed by Orange County 
with about half as many and then San Diego. Orange County's total was 22% of 
all the bike deaths in the five-county region and 13% of those statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the trend inside the county during the last five years, followed by a 
1988 comparison of Orange to the four contiguous counties:

MORE CHRONIC DRUNK DRIVERS GET STATE PRISON TERMS UNDER NEW LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chronic drunk drivers in Ventura County are increasingly being sentenced to 
state prison instead of county jail because of tough enforcement of a new state 
law allowing prosecutors to charge them as felons. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 1989, according to the Ventura County district 
attorney's office, 12 repeat drunk drivers have been sentenced to state prison 
for an average of 25 months and four others have received county jail terms 
averaging 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. said the new law permits the 
filing of felony charges against anyone arrested for driving under the 
influence who has three previous drunk-driving convictions within seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Before the law went into effect Jan. 1, O'Neill said, prosecutors could only 
file misdemeanor charges carrying penalties of six months in jail against drunk 
drivers with three previous convictions. However, judges could increase the 
penalty when drunk drivers were also on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Praising the law as an additional tool for prosecutors, O'Neill said the 
tougher provisions also make it easier for the courts to impose maximum 
penalties in "the most aggravated case," in which repeat drunk drivers have 
blood-alcohol levels far above legal limits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bradbury Takes Action 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, whose policies on prosecuting 
drunk-driving violations have been among the toughest in the state for years, 
decided last year to take maximum advantage of the new law as soon as it went 
into effect, O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
"We quickly established a blanket policy that we were going to go felony on 
everything we could," O'Neill said. "For the most aggravated case, where they 
have not addressed the problem themselves, it's warehouse time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleasantly surprised to see that over half those convicted under the new 
law are going to state prison," he added. "It's real significant that that's 
happening. Hopefully, it will be an additional deterrent to drunk drivers in 
Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
From Jan. 1 to June 30, according to O'Neill, 71 felony drunk-driving charges 
were filed by county prosecutors under the new law. O'Neill said 25 convictions 
have been obtained so far, with no acquittals. Most of the convictions resulted 
from guilty pleas, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the tougher law for repeat adult drunk drivers, O'Neill also 
praised a new state law effective Jan. 1 that takes away the driver's license 
of anyone between the ages of 13 to 20 convicted of any drug or alcohol 
offenses, including public drunkenness and possession of an open container of 
beer in a car. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any statistics yet on that, but it is having an effect too," 
O'Neill said. "The law also delays getting a license for a year in the case of 
younger teen-agers found guilty of drug and alcohol violations. That's a severe 
penalty in the view of a lot of teen-agers."

OXNARD EMPLOYEES PROTEST PACT DELAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 75 Oxnard municipal employees staged a demonstration at City Hall on 
Monday to protest stalled labor contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The Public Employees Assn. of Ventura County, which represents 314 of the 
city's about 1,000 employees, is asking for a 4.5% annual raise in its two-year 
contract. The city has countered with 2.2%. 
</P>
<P>
A mediator will be brought in Tuesday in attempts to resolve the impasse, said 
association Executive Director Barry Hammitt. Employees have been working 
without a contract since July 8.

ASK THE VET: DALMATIAN REQUIRES LIFELONG MEDICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: I have a 6-year-old Dalmatian male who, while in a vet hospital for 
something unrelated, was found to have some irregular-looking urine. A test 
showed the urine contained some small crystals. 
</P>
<P>
I have been advised that he is a likely candidate for kidney stones and will 
have to take one 300-milligram tablet of Allopurinol daily for the rest of his 
life and one teaspoon of baking soda twice a day with his meals. 
</P>
<P>
I hate to think of my dog being on this medication for the rest of his life. Is 
there any alternative to this regimen? I would appreciate any advice you could 
give me on this matter. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Ettelson, 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
A: The condition that you describe is the formation of urate crystals in the 
urine, which is very common in Dalmatians. 
</P>
<P>
Urates are the product of protein metabolism, specifically that of purines, 
which are normally converted into urates that are then transformed into a 
product called allantoin. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dalmatian, the conversion of the urates is not completed in the liver, 
and therefore these products are taken up by the kidneys and passed into the 
urine, where they may form urate crystals or stones. 
</P>
<P>
Once these stones form, the dog starts to show signs of painful urination, 
occasionally blood in the urine and eventually straining due to blockage. 
</P>
<P>
Diagnosis is made by testing the urine. In some cases, radiography may be 
necessary to identify stones in the bladder or kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
Surgery is often required to remove the stones and have them analyzed by a lab. 
</P>
<P>
Treatment of urate crystals is based on reducing the amount of purines in the 
food through special diets that exclude lean meats, liver, and kidney or diets 
that use vegetables as the source of protein. 
</P>
<P>
The use of Allopurinol is necessary because this drug decreases the production 
of uric acid. Unfortunately, the medication will be required for the life of 
the animal. 
</P>
<P>
The use of baking soda is to supply sodium bicarbonate, which will keep the 
urine in an alkaline state, reducing the formation of urate stones. 
</P>
<P>
Some veterinarians suggest adding salt to the diet to increase water 
consumption in an effort to keep the urine diluted and not allow the crystals 
to form into stones. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, all of these measures will be necessary for your Dalmatian 
because he has been diagnosed with this condition. 
</P>
<P>
It is fortunate that your veterinarian was alerted to this condition and took 
the proper steps to keep your dog healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am trying to keep my dog's teeth as clean as possible by brushing them 
with a tooth brush. 
</P>
<P>
My vet told me not to use regular toothpaste but to get a special paste 
designed for dogs. Is this really necessary? Can I use something else? 
</P>
<P>
Ann Smithcors, 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A: It is recommended that you use a paste for dogs rather than human paste 
because the latter will foam excessively and your dog may swallow it and vomit. 
</P>
<P>
You may also consider using baking soda or just gently cleaning the teeth and 
gums with a wash cloth. 
</P>
<P>
I admire your efforts to keep your dog's teeth healthy, since I see so many 
dogs with severe gum disease and infected teeth.

FORMER UCI ACTIVIST MARCHES NO MORE BUT REMAINS TRUE TO IDEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERMAN WONG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Krisman emerged as one of the best-known activists in the UCI class of 
'69. He organized boycotts, sit-ins and other demonstrations against the 
Vietnam War and the university's faculty hiring and other policies. 
</P>
<P>
He was a prominent member of the campus chapter of the militant Students for a 
Democratic Society. He joined in street protests at the 1968 Democratic 
Convention in Chicago, and later that year took an unauthorized trip to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Even after his graduation as a history major, he remained at the center of 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Off-campus conservative groups demanded that Krisman -- just hired as a UCI 
staff coordinator for academic advising -- be fired. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I still remember the big headlines and about how the John Birch and other 
groups made me out as some kind of wild radical -- which I wasn't," recalls 
Krisman, 47, who now lives in Sacramento and is principal consultant to the 
California Assembly Committee on Housing and Community Development. 
</P>
<P>
But Krisman won that battle, thanks to the backing of then-UCI Chancellor 
Daniel G. Aldrich Jr., who stressed that the activist was well-qualified. 
</P>
<P>
While he no longer takes part in protest marches, Krisman has remained a 
dedicated activist. For the past 15 years, he has continued to "work within the 
system," seeking reforms in such areas as farm labor, low-cost medical care, 
consumer advocacy and affordable housing. He has worked as administrator, field 
aide or consultant for various state agencies or commissions. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my way of doing things back at UCI. I was never a hard-core radical; 
I was always seeking change but not disruption," he says. "I wanted to avoid 
the excesses and intolerance of people on either side, left or right." 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, he started out as a "pleasant, Young Democrats kind of student." And 
as a former Army paratrooper, he was a backer of the Vietnam War at first. But 
the activism at Irvine and within the broader protest movement soon transformed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '60s, he "grew up intellectually and socially -- a kind of quantum 
leap in awareness for me and a lot of other people." 
</P>
<P>
Krisman looks forward to attending the coming reunion of the class of '69 with 
a mixture of curiosity and anticipation. "I still feel close to UC Irvine," he 
says. "Orange County still fascinates me." 
</P>
<P>
Students today see the '60s as ancient history, he says. "Today, there is no 
real commitment to the community. It's all self-gratification and greed." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are some consolations, says Krisman, who is married with three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"My older kids do realize they enjoy greater personal freedom," he says. "And 
that, I tell them, they can thank the '60s for."

LOTS OF BIG BONITO HITTING THE HOOKS AT ROCKY POINT AND CATALINA ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Big bonito have invaded sectors of Rocky Point and Catalina Island. If the 
surface water conditions remain steady, anglers can look forward to a wide-open 
bite of the fighting boneheads. 
</P>
<P>
Boats fishing Rocky Point have scored with the fighting fish going from six to 
eight pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Halderman of Long Beach, fishing on the Victory, caught a 12 1/2-pounder 
on 10-pound test line. 
</P>
<P>
At Catalina, boats report the explosive run has been going on for a week, with 
plenty of yellowtail showing but refusing both bait and jigs. 
</P>
<P>
The Venice Anglers third annual shark derby was held last weekend with 300 
anglers participating. 
</P>
<P>
The three top catches were made at the Redondo Canyon area. Duane McCutchin of 
Redondo Beach caught a 134-pound mako from his boat the Full Force. It was 
worth $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Don Snyder of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard his boat the Sea Wolf, caught a 
122-pound mako that awarded him a week's fishing at Cabo San Lucas. Jason Tress 
was also aboard the Full Force and his 109-pound catch awarded the Redondo 
Beach angler complete tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Another shark derby will be held Saturday and Sunday, sponsored by Southern 
California Enterprises. This Marina del Rey derby raises funds for the Muscular 
Dystrophy Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing will be from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. both days. Morning roll call will be at 
Frenchy's sportfishing landing at 6. The Union 76 fuel dock at Bora Bora Way 
will be the weigh-in station. Four anglers will be allowed per boat with 
registration at $200. For information, call (619) 723-7470. 
</P>
<P>
Vera Sampson of Harbor City, fishing aboard the American Angler at Benitos 
Island off Mexico, had to work for her catch. 
</P>
<P>
Using a live mackerel, she made a cast toward yellowtail that were chasing 
bait. A yellow hit and headed to the rocks. Turning, the fish peeled all of her 
25-pound test Izor line. Once around the deck she stopped it down. 
</P>
<P>
After 32 minutes the yellow surfaced and again Sampson had to reel quickly as 
seals were charging her fish. A deckhand with gaff ready beat the seals to a 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson won the jackpot when her catch weighed in at 46 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Thompson is only 6 years old but this San Pedro boy showed the veterans 
how it is done aboard the Matt Walsh Monday morning. While the anglers were 
catching bass, Thompson hooked and landed two big barracuda. The fish weighed 
seven and eight pounds each. Nick said he is going to save his money and enter 
the jackpot the next time he goes fishing. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McFindgar of Long Beach caught the whopper of the week when he pulled a 
26 1/2-pound yellowtail out of the kelp. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Fujinami of San Pedro, on a two-day trip aboard the Outerlimits, won the 
jackpot with his 24-pound yellowtail caught at Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Mechan of Long Beach won the jackpot aboard the Toronado with a 22-pound 
yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Baron of West Los Angeles captured the jackpot on the Spitfire with his 
16-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Beggs of Harbor City, fishing aboard the Annie B barge with 12-pound test 
line, bounced to the deck a 14 1/2-pound halibut. 
</P>

THE LONG HOT SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOL ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAMES FILL THE SUMMER MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the 25th annual South Bay All-Star Football Game is played tonight at El 
Camino College in Torrance, it may seem like the end of the season for die-hard 
high school football fans. 
</P>
<P>
Make that the end of the suddenly long summer season. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay game is the last on an ever-expanding list of regional prep 
all-star football games played in the Southland during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
On virtually any weekend from June through early August, a game matching top 
graduated high school seniors can be found to satisfy the appetite of the prep 
football junkie. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay event is second oldest in the Southland, surpassed only by the 
Orange County All-Star Football Game that has been played for 30 years. The 
oldest in the state is the Shrine game, which is a statewide event and has been 
played for 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum are the fledgling Glendale-Burbank game, which 
had its first kickoff July 1, and the second annual San Bernardino County 
East/West game, also played July 1. 
</P>
<P>
There are also the Ventura County and Kiwanis 605 games in June and the Hall of 
Fame, Daily News and Los Angeles Prep Senior Bowl games in July. 
</P>
<P>
The Kiwanis 605 game has players from Southeast Los Angeles and Long Beach; the 
Hall of Fame is for the San Gabriel Valley and vicinity; Daily News for the San 
Fernando Valley and vicinity and Prep Senior Bowl for the Westside and Central 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to find a region in Southern California that does not have a 
summer all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Brownfield, a former Pasadena Muir High football coach who has been 
chairman of the Hall of Fame game since its inception in 1980, concedes that 
with the most recent additions the regional all-star games have reached the 
saturation point. 
</P>
<P>
"If you put them all on a map there would be no areas left uncovered," 
Brownfield said. "Anything new would be overlapping. The Glendale-Burbank game 
overlaps with us a little." 
</P>
<P>
But Brownfield and other organizers believe there is a need for regional games. 
</P>
<P>
Brownfield said that with only a handful of players chosen for the Shrine game, 
regional all-star games fill a void. There were 34 players from Southern 
California on the South roster for this year's game, which was played Saturday 
at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"The local kids get pushed aside because the Shrine team has the smallest 
rosters," he said. "The year I coached it (in 1986) we had only 24 kids, and 
that leaves a lot of good kids out." 
</P>
<P>
With improvements in high school football over the years, Brownfield said, most 
of the regional games do not lack talent. 
</P>
<P>
"The game has gotten better," Brownfield said. "There are just more good 
players than there were in the 1960s. There are better players and better 
coaches. It's just more sophisticated, so you can have an entertaining game. 
Even if only 30 or 40 schools are represented, there is some quality out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are exceptions. Most notable was the first Glendale-Burbank 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"They had some kids that were OK but they also had some kids who wouldn't be in 
any other all-star game," said Brownfield, who attended the game." 
</P>
<P>
But quality has been a strong selling point for most of the older games. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never lacked quality," said Gary Mazelli, publicity director and former 
chairman of the South Bay game. "Every year at least two players have gone on 
to be recognizable in the pros or college, and some years it's more like four, 
five or six." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Anton, chairman of the Orange County game and president of the sponsoring 
Brea Lions Club, says top players in the county have passed up the Shrine game 
to play in their game. 
</P>
<P>
"We had about four guys pass up the Shrine game last year and we've had that 
happen almost every year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More the rule than the exception is the Hall of Fame game, which lost two of 
its players -- defensive backs Lavars Barber of Rosemead and Daryl Green of La 
Puente Nogales -- as late replacements for the Shrine game. 
</P>
<P>
Even with occasional defections to the Shrine, the Hall of Fame has had a good 
record in providing players a last-gasp opportunity to earn a college football 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had about 10 players pick up scholarships who didn't have them before 
they played in the game," Brownfield said. "It's been about one a year." 
</P>
<P>
Anton and Mazelli said players in their games also have received college 
scholarships as a result of their performances. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had guys who have been alternates for scholarships and this game has 
springboarded them to picking it up," Mazelli said. 
</P>
<P>
Most players, though, are not playing in regional all-star games with the hope 
of landing a college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"For most kids, they like these games because they want to play against good 
competition at every position," Brownfield said. "An all-star game of this kind 
is very challenging for them." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Himebaugh, recruiting coordinator at USC, is in a position to concur with 
Brownfield. Himebaugh's son, Curt, was a senior at South Hills High in Covina 
and played in the Hall of Fame game as a wide receiver. "He got a chance to 
play with a more select group of people and that was a good thing for him," 
Himebaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fun thing and that's the way to look at it. It's another chance for the 
players to play." 
</P>
<P>
For linebacker Mumbie Mushonga of Muir, who played in the Hall of Fame game, 
simply being selected for an all-star game was satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Mushonga said the only concern he had was the possibility of injury. As it 
turned out, Mushonga had reason for concern because he suffered a slight knee 
injury in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing that people feel you're one of the best in your area, it's an honor," 
said Mushonga, who will play for the University of New Mexico in the fall. "You 
like to represent your school and play well in a game like that." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say the all-star games go a long way toward reaching their 
fund-raising needs. Most are staged by local service organizations such as the 
Lions and Kiwanis clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep in touch with a lot of the others and they all say their money goes to 
help with projects," Brownfield said. "You're never going to build a hospital 
from a game like this, but that's not what they want to do. They're looking 
mostly for money for community projects and fund-raisers." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most successful of the regional games has been the Orange County 
contest, which is staged by the Brea Lions Club through its Orange County Youth 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Anton said that in recent years the game has averaged about 8,000 fans and nets 
about $30,000, most of which goes to youth-oriented charities in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep 15% for starting up every year and get a percentage after that," Anton 
said. "We net about $30,000 a year by the time we pay for insurance, uniforms, 
taping and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
The game has also been televised the last five years by an Orange County cable 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Anton said the establishment of rivalries has played an important role in the 
game's success. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a north-south game and there's a lot of county rivalry," he said. "We get 
the top players, almost all household names in the county." 
</P>
<P>
He said rosters are selected by Orange County sportswriters. "We try to keep it 
a writers' game, involve the coaches and make it a countywide game," Anton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay game, which is sponsored for charity by the West Torrance Lions 
Club and the Daily Breeze newspaper, has also been a financial success. 
</P>
<P>
Mazelli said that his game has had a few financial problems over the years but 
said that is not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"We've experienced some difficulties just as the Shrine game has, but we 
decided to stay with it because there is a nucleus of people that will support 
this each year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the game has always drawn good crowds, partly because it usually 
features a lot of players from L.A. City powers Banning and Carson. "Our 
attendence has fluctuated from 6,000 to 8,000," Mazelli said. "We'd like to 
have 14,000, but we can't expect that kind of support." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the game has been a financial success. "Every year we've managed to come 
up with some money and that's primarily due to the fact that we have a lot of 
major contributors (such as Mobil Oil and the Los Angeles Raiders) that come up 
with a lot of money to put this game on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The game has been televised by a South Bay cable company for the last four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame game, which helps raise money for the National Football 
Foundation and Hall of Fame's scholarship fund, has yet to match the attendence 
figures of the Orange County and South Bay games. 
</P>
<P>
With about 5,500 at the 10th annual game in July at Citrus College in Glendora, 
Brownfield said he has seen considerable improvement from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"When it started we were getting 1,500 people or so and end up with one 
scholarship from it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the game, which has a low-budget approach, has usually averaged a paid 
attendence of 2,500 to 3,000 and generated a profit. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always made about $5,000 on the game," Brownfield said. "The game has 
always made money. We haven't ever even broke even. So the game has paid for 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these games operate under the idea that they need to draw 3,000 to 
5,000 (to break even). If they get that they'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, organizers agree that the success of their games has been a 
factor in the declining attendence of the Shrine game. The Shrine, which 
regularly attracted crowds of 50,000 or more in the 1950s and '60s, has slumped 
in recent years, including a crowd of about 15,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what's happened to the Shrine Game is people have said we'd rather 
watch our local game and see all of our kids than go to the Shrine game and see 
only one or two," Brownfield says. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of regional games say they have no intention of competing with the 
Shrine. They say public appeal for their games stems from the fact that they 
are local in scope and carry limited expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mazelli: "This is not meant to be a Shrine game. The scale of this game 
has always been exactly what we wanted. We never wanted to be a Shrine game. 
This is the way we wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers agree that as long as they follow that approach, the summer will 
continue to seem like a second season for high school football.

TRAIL-HIKING STUDENTS TRACK THE SECRETS OF NATURE -- AND OF HOW TO WRITE ABOUT 
IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the students hiked into the Santa Monica Mountains toward Eagle Rock, they 
stopped to study the rocks, the clouds and a horned lizard, the size of a 
quarter, that could have starred in a movie called "Honey, I Shrunk the 
Stegosaurus." 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, a student dropped behind, pulled a journal from pocket or 
backpack and scribbled a paragraph or two. One student wrote a mini-essay about 
life and death, inspired by a patch of dead buckwheat. Another noted that the 
mountain trail was "as wide as a spare rib." 
</P>
<P>
The 16 students were taking an unusual course being offered for the first time 
this summer by Santa Monica College. Called "Writing About Nature," the 
double-credit course is an introduction to physical geography and a beginning 
composition course. Taught by geographer Bill Selby and poet Jim Krusoe, it 
requires students to learn how to use both a sling psychrometer and a simile. 
Those who succeed get credit for both Geography 1 and English 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although the teachers' disciplines diverge dramatically, Selby and Krusoe say 
they have a common goal -- to teach students to observe closely and to record 
their observations with precision. "So many of our students have lost the 
ability to observe things that aren't fed to them," Selby said. "You have to be 
a good observer to be a great writer, and there's never been a great scientist 
who wasn't a great observer." 
</P>
<P>
During the six-week course, the students learn something about maps, weather 
and climate, geology and the plants and animals of Southern California. They 
work their way through a text called "Modern Physical Geography." Classroom 
lessons are supplemented with a weekly field trip, such as the recent hike to 
Eagle Rock in Topanga State Park. As the students are learning what an 
inversion is they are also studying nature writing and learning how to string 
together their own words about the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, they have to learn to write in six weeks," Krusoe said. "It's a 
killer." 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe exposes the students to model nature writers as disparate as Romantic 
poet William Wordsworth and contemporary environmental activist Edward Abbey. 
According to Krusoe, Sue Hubbell's book, "Country Year," is especially useful 
to beginning nature writers. 
</P>
<P>
In critiquing students' journal entries, Krusoe is quick to praise evidence 
that they are paying close attention, whether observing an alligator lizard 
barely visible in the dust or a distant cluster of homes that looks like a 
beehive when viewed from the mountains. "The funny thing about paying 
attention," he told his students, as they perched on Eagle Rock, moments after 
displacing a raven, "is that when you really see something, sometimes it's even 
better than just using your imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe said students tend to "get too pretty" when they begin to write about 
storm clouds and life cycles. Krusoe's reading assignments for the course are 
examples of writing about nature without verbal genuflection. The assigned 
writers have "natural voices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a geographer, Selby said he is repeatedly shocked and saddened at the lack 
of widespread knowledge about weather, the rock cycle and other natural 
phenomena. "It's scary to know that so many people know so little about the 
world we live in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Resting with the students on Eagle Rock, Selby talked about the materials that 
formed the outcropping and the natural forces that created it. Geology lessons 
are much more vivid in the wild than in the classroom. "You can't stand here 
and see the rock cycle, but you get a feeling for how the rock cycle is 
changing the landscape," Selby said. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Batiste, 26, said she had taken the course to fulfill a science 
requirement and because she thought she would benefit from the writing 
component. After the first class, the Inglewood woman recalled, she was able to 
identify the stone in the campus parking lot as shale.

BIG TITLES AND BIG MONEY; 
</P>
<P>
TOP-RANKED DOUBLES PLAYER HAS SINGLE-MINDED DETERMINATION TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Pugh, the world's top-ranked doubles player, sat in the living room of his 
parents' Palos Verdes Estate home. He constantly glanced at the tennis court in 
the back yard, the one he practices on when he's in town. 
</P>
<P>
Lately though, he's been globe-trotting, winning big tennis titles and big 
money. And now he's relaxing after winning a mixed doubles title at Wimbledon 
and a singles championship in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
For those who knew Pugh as an adolescent, his success may be somewhat 
surprising, because he wasn't a star at Palos Verdes High or even at UCLA. He 
left UCLA after two mediocre seasons for a professional career that was a 
initially struggle. 
</P>
<P>
But Pugh, 25, did show flashes of stardom early in his career. When he was 13 
he defeated Jimmy Arias in the finals of the prestigious Orange Bowl 
Tournament, and was one of the nation's top-ranked juniors. 
</P>
<P>
"That year he lost only one set and that was to Arias," said John Hillebrand, 
who coached Pugh from the time he was 10 until he was 23. "When I met him he 
was a champion 10-year old, hitting flat-top spin and slice. When he played in 
the 12s, no one could handle his topspin and he was very consistent. He really 
dominated that year." 
</P>
<P>
But Pugh's successful junior career took a dive after that. At Palos Verdes and 
at UCLA he was a gangly, 6-foot-4 kid with a nagging shoulder injury and a lot 
of developing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times," Pugh said, "when I really wondered if I would still be 
good. I wondered if I still had it." 
</P>
<P>
Tendinitis in his right shoulder forced him to play his senior year at Palos 
Verdes left handed. The injury affected his performance at UCLA where he was 
excluded from the singles lineup as a freshman but played No. 3 doubles. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore in 1984, he reached the finals of the Pacific-10 tournament in 
Ojai and earned the No. 3 singles spot late in the season. UCLA won the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. title that year, but Pugh contributed little 
because he pulled a stomach muscle shortly before the Georgia tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"He was real solid and he had very solid ground strokes," said UCLA tennis 
Coach Glenn Bassett, who has led the Bruins to seven NCAA titles in 24 years. 
"But when he was here he was a little bit like a giraffe. He was real thin. Now 
he's filled out and he's a lot stronger." 
</P>
<P>
So is Pugh's game, which is considered unorthodox because he uses a two-handed 
forehand as well as a two-handed backhand. As a youth he says several coaches 
attempted to correct it, but he refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have changed it when I was younger," Pugh said, "but it works. I've 
always been pretty coordinated with both hands. I guess it started when I was 4 
and my dad first took me out to play. The racket was pretty heavy, so I had to 
hold it with both hands." 
</P>
<P>
The unusual style of play has proven successful for Pugh who's ranked 59th in 
the world in singles. It's helped him win four mixed doubles grand slam titles 
and a singles championship. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month at Wimbledon he and Czechoslovakian partner Jana Novotna won 
the mixed doubles title by defeating Australians Jenny Byrne and Mark Kratzmann 
in three sets. Pugh and Novotna also won this year's Australian Open title and 
last year they won both the Australian and U.S. Open mixed doubles titles. 
</P>
<P>
"At the 1988 Australian Open," Pugh said, "I didn't have a mixed doubles 
partner and I just went up to the women's association desk and they referred me 
to (Novotna). So far so good." 
</P>
<P>
Things have also gone well with Rick Leach, a former USC standout, who teamed 
up with Pugh in January of last year. The former college rivals reached the 
men's doubles finals at Wimbledon. With the exception of a quarterfinal, 
five-set match, they cruised through all their rounds in straight sets. In the 
finals they lost to Australian John Fitzgerald and Swede Anders Jarryd. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what happened," Pugh said shaking his head. "We had won 
most of our matches fairly comfortably, but we just couldn't pull that one out. 
It was still great to make it that far." 
</P>
<P>
His doubles victories were exciting, but Pugh says the highlight of his trip to 
England was beating John McEnroe at the Wirral Invitational right before 
Wimbledon. He defeated the world's fifth-ranked player in two tie-breaker sets 
and received congratulatory fan mail at Wimbledon for his accomplishment. "It 
was kind of nice to get mail from people I didn't even know," Pugh said. It's 
just that in England they love to hate McEnroe. I'd say that was my best 
singles win ever." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe got even at Wimbledon, defeating Pugh in the third round and proceeding 
to the semifinals where he lost to Stefan Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very determined," Pugh said. "He really wanted to beat me. But when I 
beat him I played out of my head. I couldn't miss." 
</P>
<P>
And that's what Pugh did in his next tournament, less than a day after his 
Wimbledon mixed doubles triumph. He headed for Newport, R.I., and won his first 
professional singles title. 
</P>
<P>
Though exhausted because of the time change and lengthy plane ride, Pugh beat 
sixth-seeded Peter Lundgren in the final of the Volvo-Hall of Fame 
Championships as an unseeded player. 
</P>
<P>
He's still surprised at his performance in Newport. In fact, he thought he 
might not make it to his first-round match because Wimbledon mixed doubles ran 
a day late because of a rain delay. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't know if it's sunk in yet," Pugh said of the victory. "I didn't 
get there until 4 a.m. because I had to play mixed on Monday and I was 
jet-lagged out. I thought I'd probably lose in the first round." 
</P>
<P>
That sounds a lot like the Jim Pugh who doubted his ability 10 years ago. Only 
now he has the physique and refined skills to prove that he does. That's why 
he's taking a break and kicking back in Hawaii this week instead of worrying 
about the U.S. Open next month.

SECOND TIME AROUND, HART PICKS HERRINGTON TO HEAD FOOTBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Herrington, passed over for the job a year ago, has been installed as the 
third football coach in 17 months at Hart High. 
</P>
<P>
Hart Principal Laurence Strauss elected to hire Herrington on Tuesday night and 
announced the decision Wednesday. Herrington, who coached at Bellflower last 
season, replaces Dave Carson, who was forced to resign July 20. Carson had 
replaced Rick Scott, who resigned last April to coach at Buena High in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington will leave Bellflower and work at Hart as a substitute teacher until 
a teaching position becomes available. Herrington is credentialed to teach 
physical education, health and driver education. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just real happy to be back at Hart," Herrington said. "It's a situation 
where I think the principal feels my coaching philosophy and my coaching 
techniques are what they need." 
</P>
<P>
Herrington, who met with the Hart team Wednesday, is seen as a popular choice. 
He and his brothers, Dean and Rick, had been assistant coaches at Hart during 
the 1980s until Strauss selected Carson and passed over Mike when the job 
opened last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never bitter about that," Herrington said. "I understood where the 
principal stood. (Coming back) was not a matter of swallowing my pride, it was 
a matter of where is the No. 1 place Mike Herrington wants to coach football." 
</P>
<P>
Dean and Rick Herrington said that they will consider their options and will 
not automatically follow their brother back to Hart. Still, the return of at 
least one Herrington has inspired some of the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited and feel confident about the season," Hart quarterback Rob 
Westervelt said. "Mike is just a great coach. He knows how to coach kids and 
he's fun to play for. I'm ready to get going." 
</P>
<P>
Herrington was graduated from Hart in 1976 and played offensive tackle for two 
seasons each at College of the Canyons and Cal State Northridge. He returned to 
Hart and worked as a varsity assistant for eight seasons before taking the 
Bellflower job. 
</P>
<P>
He coached on two Southern Section championship teams at Hart and worked as 
offensive and defensive coordinator for Scott. But it was his experience as a 
head coach at Bellflower that convinced Strauss to hire him this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that he's been a head coach and been in charge of a program has given 
him additional experience," Strauss said. "Mike is stable, level-headed and 
hard-working. He's dedicated to football and Hart High and is well-liked by 
everyone he works around." 
</P>
<P>
Herrington's Hart connections also influenced Strauss, who said that the 
program needed someone who could facilitate a quick transition. Hart ends its 
summer program today and starts two-a-day drills Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The hire ends a turbulent two weeks at Hart. Carson was a popular and 
successful coach at Burbank, one of Hart's Foothill League rivals. The Indians 
had won 20 consecutive league games under Scott but managed only a third-place 
finish in 1988. Hart lost in the first round of the playoffs and finished 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss forced Carson to resign because he claimed the coach ran a negative 
program and failed to curtail his use of profane language. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a traumatic time," Strauss said. "We need to get some 
consistency and continuity in the program and I think Mike will fulfill that 
need."

An effort to recall Councilwoman H. M. (Lennie) Wagner has ended because her 
opponents failed to obtain enough petition signatures to force a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The effort was led by Art Perez, a member of the city Public Safety Commission 
and an ally of Councilwoman Kathleen Navejas and her husband, Carlos, both 
former mayors. 
</P>
<P>
Perez and his forces needed to collect 895 signatures over a 60-day period. 
They collected 940, but 257 were declared invalid by the Los Angeles County 
registrar-recorder's office, said City Clerk Carol Dorfmeyer. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, who is serving her first term, ended up the only target in a recall war 
that broke out in the city last February and at one point involved every member 
of the council. The other members managed to pacify their political opponents 
and recall efforts against them evaporated, but Wagner's opponents persisted. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, I feel relieved," Wagner said this week, "because when you try to 
do a really good job, it hurts you to think there are people who don't realize 
how hard you work."

Unfair Trading to Be Discussed: The United States and Japan will discuss U.S. 
allegations that Japan is an unfair trader at a regular meeting of the 
bilateral trade committee, scheduled for September. "We can use this meeting to 
clarify what the United States is saying without actually negotiating with 
them," which will save face for the Japanese, a trade official for that country 
said. Tokyo protested vehemently when Washington charged Japan at the end of 
May with unfair trading practices in supercomputers, wood products and 
satellites.

HOPE TO USE TAX CUT AS LEVERAGE IN BUDGET TALKS

House Democratic leaders, struggling to extricate themselves from a political 
quagmire, backed away Wednesday from an immediate confrontation with President 
Bush over his proposal to cut capital gains taxes after House Democrats failed 
to reach a consensus on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.), who has forged a slim majority on the tax-writing Ways 
and Means Committee in favor of a plan to cut the capital gains rate for most 
individual taxpayers from 28% to 20% through 1991, said he could win a showdown 
on the House floor, despite the all-out opposition of party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a majority," Jenkins told reporters after House Democrats met in 
private for about an hour and a half to debate the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Although most Democrats remain opposed to a capital gains tax cut, several 
conceded that Jenkins is right: Enough Democrats are willing to join the solid 
bloc of Republicans to approve a capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move to Delay Vote 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the probabilities of a capital gains (cut) are looking better 
and better," said California Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento). 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Democratic leaders moved to delay any vote until after Congress' 
August vacation. Many apparently hope to force Bush to accept higher taxes in 
future budget negotiations in return for granting him a capital gains cut. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say it's a club," said Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.), but "the 
only way to solve the budget crunch coming next year . . . is to put everything 
on the table." 
</P>
<P>
A letter from capital gains opponents, led by Rep. Don J. Pease (D-Ohio) and 
House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), urged Democrats to hold out 
a capital gains rate cut as a bargaining chip with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"Our continuing massive budget deficit will require us to raise substantial 
revenues, probably as soon as next year," stated the letter, signed by nine 
Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee. "Addressing capital gains now, 
separate from any larger budget negotiations, hands President Bush the single 
largest plum on his wish list without getting anything (in return). Instead of 
tough negotiations and compromise, we are looking at unilateral disarmament." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, however, are pressing lawmakers to approve a capital 
gains cut as part of a $5.3-billion revenue package called for in the budget 
that Congress is drafting for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Bush's proposal contend that a lower tax rate for capital gains 
-- the profits on investments in stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets -- 
would encourage risk taking and spur economic growth. Most Democrats deride the 
idea as an unnecessary giveaway to the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Understanding 
</P>
<P>
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), while 
holding out hopes of a future compromise that would include a plan to adjust 
capital gains to take account of inflation, expressed frustration that White 
House officials remain adamantly in favor of a rate cut. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult for me to negotiate with the White House," he said. "I 
don't know who it is that can say: 'OK, we've got an understanding.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, continuing his effort to turn around at least one vote in his 
committee to block the Jenkins approach, met with Republicans Wednesday to 
discuss various alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Early reports Tuesday night suggested that Rostenkowski is recommending a 
compromise that might allow investors who sell an asset to subtract some past 
inflation from their capital gain as well as future inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) told reporters that one feature of 
Rostenkowski's plan that "merits consideration" is a 25% reduction in capital 
gains tax rates for assets held at least five years and a 50% reduction for 
assets held 10 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats said Rostenkowski is playing with a number of alternatives in hopes 
of forging a new majority. "There is no plan at this point," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Moody (D-Wis.) told reporters: "Time is on the side of the package 
that will be worked on by the chairman." 
</P>
<P>
But advocates of a capital gains tax cut were also convinced that they have the 
upper hand. "I'm for a capital gains differential, period," Jenkins said. "It's 
just a question of timing."

IRWIN JACOBS MAKES $2.85-BILLION BID FOR AVON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Minneapolis investor Irwin L. Jacobs is proposing a $2.85-billion takeover of 
Avon Products, a 103-year-old cosmetics giant that has rejected two other 
recent buyout offers. 
</P>
<P>
Avon said Wednesday that it had received a letter from Jacobs late Tuesday 
requesting a meeting to negotiate an all-cash deal. James E. Preston, Avon's 
chairman, said the company's board would discuss Jacobs' letter at a regularly 
scheduled board meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said he has hired Citicorp, the New York banking organization, to 
arrange financing to acquire Avon, long known for its "Avon lady" direct sales 
force. Under the plan, Jacobs would sell Avon's retail unit, which includes the 
fragrance lines of Giorgio Beverly Hills and Parfums Stern. 
</P>
<P>
The Giorgio division's main fragrance, also known as Giorgio Beverly Hills, had 
sales exceeding $100 million in 1988. It was the nation's top-selling fragrance 
offered exclusively in department stores. Santa Monica-based Giorgio in 
February launched a second fragrance, Red from Giorgio Beverly Hills. The 
Parfums Stern line includes Uninhibited by Cher and the Oscar de la Renta, 
Perry Ellis and Valentino fragrances. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs, in a telephone interview, said he would sell the retail division to 
offset the cost of the proposed acquisition and reduce Avon's $1 billion of 
existing debt. 
</P>
<P>
"They're good companies but they just don't fit into our plans," Jacobs added. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said he wants to acquire Avon to boost the sales of Winona, Minn.-based 
Watkins Inc., a company he bought in 1978 involved in the direct sale of 
spices, cosmetics and skin cleansers. Avon's sales operation -- particularly 
its international sales force -- could help sell Watkins products, Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Name Came Up Before 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Jacobs would pay $41 per share for 54.9 million shares of 
common stock and has offered to redeem each of Avon's 18 million preferred 
shares for $33.50. Avon's common stock rose 87.5 cents to close at $36.375 a 
share Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not sit down with me to explore the feasibility of this transaction?" 
Jacobs' letter said. "Why not demonstrate to me why I should pay more if you 
find $41 to be inadequate?" 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs' name came up previously in connection with a proposed Avon takeover. 
Amway, which has a partnership with Jacobs that owns 10% of Avon's stock, made 
a $2.1-billion bid for Avon in May. The offer was withdrawn after Avon rejected 
it with a blistering statement that branded Amway, also a direct sales firm, an 
"admitted criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs, who owns about 5.5% of Avon's stock by himself, was not involved in the 
Amway offer and said Amway was not involved in his new proposal. He added that 
he would not sell any portion of Avon to Amway or to Dallas-based Mary Kay 
Cosmetics Inc., a direct seller that has also recently expressed interest in 
Avon. 
</P>
<P>
Avon, in a written response to Jacobs, noted that it has consistently rejected 
buyout offers. Many industry analysts said they expect Avon to reject Jacobs' 
offer.

FACTORY ORDERS TURN HIGHER DURING MONTH

Factory orders rebounded by 0.4% in June after a sharp 2.6% fall in May, the 
Commerce Department said Wednesday, showing that the economy is struggling to 
extend its seven-year expansion. 
</P>
<P>
And in another favorable report, the department said sales of new single-family 
homes rose by 5.5% in June to their highest level since January, with sales in 
the West jumping more than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's factories boosted orders for machines, electrical equipment and 
fabricated metals but cut back on orders for raw metals, such as steel and 
aluminum, and auto equipment during the month, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
The $993-million increase from May's level left factory orders -- the lifeline 
of industrial growth -- at a seasonally adjusted $234.56 billion in June. 
</P>
<P>
The June rebound showed that the industrial slowdown under way has taken a 
pause, economists said, allowing growth to inch forward in the overall economy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all the data we've seen is consistent with a fairly pervasive slowdown 
in the manufacturing sector, but it does not indicate an impending recession," 
said economist Norman Robertson at Pittsburgh's Mellon Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The closely watched purchasing managers index, which was released Tuesday, 
showed the industrial sector contracting for the third month in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists are now convinced that the manufacturing economy is entering a 
mild recession, but they also say robust demand for services has prevented the 
weakness from spreading throughout the economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Fine Balance 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to be having a soft landing," said economist Mike Penzer at Bank of 
America in San Francisco. "There's no recession yet." 
</P>
<P>
A soft landing refers to the slowing of the economy and inflation without 
pushing the economy into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with last week's report of an increase in existing home sales, 
Wednesday's housing report "is another little bit of evidence the housing 
market is picking up," said economist Richard Peach of the Mortgage Bankers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Home sales were boosted in June by a sharp 23.4% increase in the West, after a 
2.7% rise in that part of the country in May. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it was provoked by a strong movement into California before land-use 
controls came into effect," said Dave Seiders, chief economist of the National 
Assn. of Home Builders. "It's hard for me to believe that level of activity in 
the West can be sustained," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide June rise, which followed a revised 4.3% gain in May, lifted 
home sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 670,000 units, the Commerce 
Department said. It was the highest rate since January, when sales reached an 
annual rate of 700,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, high prices continued to take their toll on Northeast sales, which 
plunged 18.2%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices Advance 
</P>
<P>
The slack in the Northeast housing market follows a very strong period of 
activity in 1986, 1987 and 1988, Seiders said. "The economy's still solid 
there, but I think the biggest problem in the Northeast is affordability." 
</P>
<P>
Home sales in the South and Midwest rose by 1.9% and 3.1%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of a home in the United States rose to $159,100 in June from 
$146,800 in May and $136,500 in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to a year ago, however, home sales were down 6.4% from 716,000 units 
in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The markets shrugged off the economic news, which was in line with 
expectations. Traders are now awaiting the important employment report on 
Friday to see whether job growth is slowing enough to prompt another round of 
interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed recently eased credit to stimulate growth, and the first signs of a 
rebound have shown up in the housing market, economists said. The Commerce 
Department reported a healthy 5.5% rise in single-family home sales in June, 
extending a 4.3% rise in May.

No Merger Vote: The B. Manischewitz Co. said that at its special shareholders 
meeting on Monday it will not consider the $44.6-million buyout offer made by 
Beverly Hills-based Levine, Tessler, Leichtman &amp; Co., dashing prospects for 
a revived merger plan between the two firms. The companies had reached a 
preliminary merger agreement, but then broke off talks on Monday after 
differences emerged. Manischewitz also said it received a demand by Levine 
Tessler for a termination fee and expenses totaling $3.4 million as a result of 
the alleged failure by Manischewitz to try its best to complete the proposed 
merger.

JURY WANTS TO REDUCE PENALTY IN NEWPORT CASE 
</P>

<P>
A federal jury said Wednesday that the six defendants found guilty in the 
Princeton/Newport Limited Partners securities fraud trial should forfeit $3.8 
million to the government under the racketeering law, far less than the $22 
million that prosecutors had demanded. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Robert L. Carter said he almost certainly will overturn 
the jury's findings and grant the prosecutors' request for the full $22 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The quick turn of events first raised the spirits of the defendants and their 
families, who had expected the worst after Monday's guilty verdict. But the 
judge's comments on taking the full $22 million erased their relief and left 
them bewildered. 
</P>
<P>
The six were found guilty by the same jury Monday on 63 counts, including 
racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud and mail fraud. The 
government charged that the six arranged sham trades of securities so that 
Princeton/Newport could claim phony tax losses. The case was noteworthy because 
it marked the first use of the racketeering law against top executives of a 
securities firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Exorbitant' 
</P>
<P>
Under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, 
defendants found guilty of participating in a continuing criminal enterprise 
can be forced to forfeit to the government their full financial interest in the 
enterprise, including amounts gained from legitimate activities. 
</P>
<P>
But the jurors indicated by their verdict Wednesday that they felt that taking 
the full amount wouldn't be appropriate in this case. After the forfeiture 
verdict, juror Michelle Rodriguez said in a brief interview on the courthouse 
steps that "we thought what the government asked was exorbitant." She declined 
to elaborate, however, on how the jurors arrived at precise figures for each 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Carter said that, because of his interpretation of the RICO law, he 
almost certainly will grant prosecutors' request for the full $22 million, 
representing salaries, management fees and partnership interests in 
Princeton/Newport and related companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleased by Ruling 
</P>
<P>
As part of the verdict returned Wednesday, the jurors formally found that the 
defendants did have a financial interest in the criminal enterprise. The judge 
said once the jurors decided that, it was unnecessary for them to determine 
amounts, since the law provides for forfeiture of the full amount of their 
interest. "As I understand the law, interest in the enterprise is totally 
forfeitable," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't clear why the judge, given his view of the law, had permitted 
attorneys to make arguments to the jury about the amounts and had given jurors 
a blank verdict form, with a space to write in the amounts for each defendant. 
The judge said he will rule on the issue after he receives written arguments 
from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers in the case said they were pleased by the jury's ruling on the 
amounts of money. They said they believed that an appellate court would 
reinstate the jury's findings if Judge Carter carries out his preliminary 
decision to overturn them. Defense lawyers had argued that full forfeiture 
would be "Draconian" and would amount to cruel and unusual punishment. Defense 
lawyers said the amounts demanded by the government would wipe out the entire 
net worth of several of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Schwartz, lawyer for defendant Jack Z. Rabinowitz, a 
Princeton/Newport general partner, said that in the aftermath of the guilty 
verdict, the jury's decision on the amounts of money "looks to me like an 
apology." 
</P>
<P>
The defendants are due to be sentenced Oct. 16 and face the possibility of 
lengthy prison terms and fines in addition to the forfeiture. Defense lawyers 
said they plan to appeal the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The jury decided that Rabinowitz and defendants Charles M. Zarzecki, Paul A. 
Berkman and Bruce L. Newberg should forfeit only $200,000 each. Prosecutors 
claimed that they should each give up amounts ranging from $2.57 million for 
Newberg to $1.24 million for Rabinowitz. 
</P>
<P>
The government had demanded that James Sutton Regan, the managing general 
partner of Princeton/Newport, give up $15.96 million, but the jury said he 
should pay only $3 million. The government had asked that Steven B. Smotrich, 
the Princeton/Newport controller, pay $124,585, but jurors came up with a very 
precise figure on how much they thought he should pay: $1,245.85. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Rodriguez said jurors came up with that amount for Smotrich because it 
represents 1% of what the government had asked for, and "we felt he was 1% 
guilty." But she refused to explain further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm Is Defunct 
</P>
<P>
Five of the defendants had been officials of Princeton/Newport, which had 
offices in Newport Beach and Princeton, N.J. The firm went out of business 
after the indictment. Newberg had been a trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
and is also a defendant in the case against former Drexel junk bond chief 
Michael Milken. The indictment in that case includes charges that overlap with 
the Princeton/Newport indictment. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview after the jury was dismissed, juror Joseph Pastina, 
66, a retired manager of a delicatessen, said he wouldn't be disturbed if the 
judge overturns the jury's findings on the forfeiture. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured it should have been left to the judge to begin with," he said. 
"That's what we all felt. I don't know why we should have been burdened with 
it."

U.S. PROBING CHARGES OF DOUBLE BILLING AT BOEING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government is investigating allegations that Boeing Co. overcharged 
and double-billed the Department of Defense millions of dollars for repairs of 
buildings leased for secret military work. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation by two defense agencies, a congressional panel, and 
reportedly, the Department of Justice's criminal division, was sparked by a 
Boeing electrical engineer and inspector, Kevin G. Kelly, who was fired Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But it has gone beyond his allegations, said an investigator for a congressman 
looking at the case. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation appears to have started with Boeing's lease of buildings 
under government contract from millionaire Seattle developer David Sabey, 
according to an internal Boeing memorandum obtained by the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings were built to Boeing's specifications by Sabey. But Kelly says 
three buildings at one office park were substandard and required $3 million in 
repairs, and that Boeing billed the government for the work, rather than Sabey. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokesman Paul Binder confirmed Tuesday that an investigation was under 
way but declined further comment about the specifics of the probe. Sabey Corp. 
attorney Don Berdick said the firm would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
The leases with Sabey include buildings at two office parks used by Boeing 
Advanced Systems for military work. The Boeing division has defense contracts 
and subcontracts that range from work on the B-2 Stealth bomber to guided 
missile systems and avionic research.

AUSSIE AD EXECUTIVE SHARES THE SECRET OF HOW HE REMADE HIS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 40-year-old man in the mirror was Bryce Courtenay and his image was a 
picture of Dorian Gray. 
</P>
<P>
He stood overweight and flaccid in limp sweats. An old Rugby football injury -- 
four cracked vertebrae healed by the stalwart silence demanded of public 
schoolboys -- made him hunch and rest one leg on tiptoe to contain the pain. 
</P>
<P>
Courtenay saw an aged Australian rheumy from working until dawn, and deeper 
damage done by years on the Crocodile Dundee Diet -- five packs of cigarettes 
and two dozen beers a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a dead man," Courtenay recalls. His Sydney colleagues might only have 
seen a corporate killer; a wealthy, honored and hugely envied Australian 
advertising executive. "But I realized that this obese little guy would not be 
alive in five years. I had everything and nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Yet he did have the power of one. 
</P>
<P>
So he returned to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"I resigned from J. Walter Thompson that morning. I stopped drinking that day. 
I stopped smoking that day. And I put myself in hospital that day." 
</P>
<P>
There -- after surgery that left him a statue in a body cast for three months 
-- Courtenay drew an outrageous plan for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing to it. He would form a new advertising business into a 
multimillion-dollar concern to guarantee college educations for his three sons. 
Then he would sell the agency and retire to write a dozen novels. Of course 
they would become best sellers. 
</P>
<P>
At 55. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes. Despite the spinal fusings, he vowed to recover and run marathons. 
</P>
<P>
Courtenay was in Los Angeles recently. 
</P>
<P>
He moves now as a proportioned, broad-shouldered welterweight. 
</P>
<P>
He has run 17 marathons and one in a little over three hours. 
</P>
<P>
His sons have their higher schooling. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, Robinson &amp; Courtenay Ltd. of Sydney, Australia, with annual 
billings of about $85 million is without its founding partner because Courtenay 
sold the agency for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
He has written his first novel. 
</P>
<P>
It is on best-seller lists in England, Australia and South Africa and Random 
House has printed 75,000 copies for U.S. distribution, which, the publisher 
says, is significant for any first novel. 
</P>
<P>
At 54, Courtenay is a year ahead of his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"This has left me enormously bemused," he said. That's because he realizes he 
hasn't paid full dues as a writer. "I don't come to writing having written 42 
reasonable poems and 19 short stories for Playboy. I just sat down one day and 
started hacking out some words." 
</P>
<P>
Commented New York Times reviewer Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of Courtenay's 
middle-aged hacking: "If a shrewdly programmed computer were to design the 
ultimate international best seller, it couldn't do much better than this first 
novel. On almost any scale of measurement 'The Power of One' has everything. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
Noted a London Sunday Times reviewer: "A very reassuring book . . . already 
halfway to the screenplay for the film that must surely follow." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He's Taken a Meeting 
</P>
<P>
That, too. While in Los Angeles, Courtenay met with Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
"But whether it (the book) becomes a movie . . . is not one of life's major 
decisions," he insisted in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
But battling for personal beliefs against setbacks, copouts, and the easy 
compromise is integral to the new and improved Bryce Courtenay. 
</P>
<P>
It also is that power of one at its purest. 
</P>
<P>
"The power of one is that thing that makes all people who have a tendency to 
succeed, succeed," he explained. "It is the highest level of (personal) 
survival. I really believe that life is a question of letdowns and broken 
contracts. We can exist within that situation or we can prevail. 
</P>
<P>
"The power of one is the person who insists that he will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
It follows that success against long odds and short change is the theme of 
Courtenay's first novel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
South African Childhood 
</P>
<P>
This time, the grit truly is with Peekay, a 5-year-old white South African boy 
growing through adolescence during World War II. Peekay is Oliver Twist, a Lord 
of the Flies, young Jim Graham in "Empire of the Sun" and through his 
uncluttered eyes, the author's message becomes an expose without direct comment 
against an enduring inequity: apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
"The Power of One" is not Courtenay's autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
It certainly is a chronicle of his spirit. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in small-town South Africa, "of generations of English stock . . . 
one of those families that holds itself up proudly but never amounts to 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Courtenay's father, a lawyer, was killed in a car crash two months before his 
son was born. His mother was a dressmaker. 
</P>
<P>
"So there I was, poor, but not aware that I was poor until I got a scholarship 
to a very exclusive boarding school," Courtenay explained. "I suddenly realized 
I had no pocket money and only one of everything and that was patched and 
worn." 
</P>
<P>
But he was a solid athlete and a straight-A student who read everything by 
Dickens before he was 11. 
</P>
<P>
"I was writing novels and reading them to my mother as the Singer sewing 
machine would be going," he remembered. "She never heard them but that didn't 
matter. There was nothing else, at 10 or 11, that I wanted to do but write." 
</P>
<P>
Young Courtenay also learned to rock boats. Such as his stand against 
segregation during student debates at that very proper boarding school. 
</P>
<P>
"I started, literally, as the child in the book, suckling a black woman's 
breasts," he said. "I could never actually overcome . . . this idea that people 
were people and that skin couldn't possibly have anything to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Chastised for his debate position, he was summoned to the headmaster's office: 
"He said: 'Look, black is black and white is white and never the twain shall 
meet.' I said: 'You are wrong.' He said: 'You are an upper-middle-class South 
African boy who is destined for greatness and you must forget this kind of 
nonsense.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Courtenay didn't. He repeated his stand to a committee of uncles and 
cousins when they proposed he follow Courtenay tradition and study at Oxford 
University before becoming a lawyer. "I told them: 'I can't do it. I can't 
become a lawyer and come back to South Africa and do anything else but defend 
the situation that the black man finds himself in.' 
</P>
<P>
"My family seriously questioned my sanity. Suddenly, chop, my line of support 
was gone." 
</P>
<P>
His power of one, however, was intact. 
</P>
<P>
Courtenay still wanted to write. 
</P>
<P>
So he followed the power to the ways of Jack London. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Young Wanderer 
</P>
<P>
Courtenay boxed, bummed and backpacked the Belgian Congo (now Zaire). He worked 
deadly jobs ("of 15 guys who joined with me, nine died in the 18 months") below 
ground in Rhodesian copper mines until he had hoarded enough money to pay for 
English studies at King's College, London. 
</P>
<P>
Courtenay wandered to Norway and won a merchant seaman's ticket in a waterfront 
poker game. The next slow boat from Oslo was headed for Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"The bosun said to me: 'When you see Sydney you're probably going to jump 
ship.' At 7 o'clock one morning we were coming through the (Sydney harbor) 
Heads and the water was like a millpond and startlingly beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
"There was this large, white house with trees and bougainvillea spilling out 
onto its own beach. I said: 'One day I'll own that home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Courtenay jumped with loose change and a pack of cigarettes. He leaped straight 
into advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"Television was just breaking in Australia and I had taken a (TV) course while 
in London," he said. "That made me less of an idiot than anyone else. I somehow 
parlayed this . . . as an expert in writing television commercials. But mostly 
on the strength of looking at BBC television commercials and rewriting them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swift Rise to the Top 
</P>
<P>
In five years, he became creative director, then Southeast Asian chairman and 
then World Board member for McCann-Erickson. He repeated the ascent at J. 
Walter Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
And 17 years after arriving in Sydney, he bought the 100-year-old harbor-side 
house with the bougainvillea spilling onto the beach. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Courtenay sees it now, his career was an obsessive, self-destructive 
pursuit. "In becoming successful in life, the cost was my own conscience, my 
questioning of what was morally right or wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I was brilliantly camouflaged. People would point and say: 'There's a complete 
personality.' Yet there was the most incomplete personality you've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
And what personal price this masquerade? Why his lust for prizes and the 
acceptance of peers? 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't like that when I had nothing to lose," he reasoned. "The moment I had 
something to lose, I started becoming what the system required." 
</P>
<P>
Then he saw that Bryce Courtenay in a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, I could no longer justify the compromises," he remembers. "I had to 
see what was under this swaddling cloth. What was the power of one?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Against the Odds 
</P>
<P>
It was, for openers, deciding against a medical suggestion for a series of back 
surgeries over a period of two years. Courtenay opted for one massive operation 
and three months immobile in a chin-to-toenail body cast. 
</P>
<P>
Staring at a hospital ceiling, he massaged the power again. The ceiling became 
a blank sheet of paper. Courtenay concentrated. He began to type mental 
outlines. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I had spent the three months, I had typed the scenarios for 17 
books," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he couldn't just limp away from life and become a writer. There were 
responsibilities to the wife he still considers after 32 years to be "my 
dearest friend . . . a strange, strong woman." There also was the mansion of 
his earlier memories, for which he was personally indebted for almost $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
But he could start his own advertising agency, build it for a decade and then 
sell it. "That would pay off all my debts, and I could start my second life," 
he continued. "I flogged (sold) it (the agency) almost on the day 10 years 
later for an indecent amount of money, paid off my debts and had enough to 
start writing and live for six years." 
</P>
<P>
He began marathon running as much for resolve as for exercise "because, again, 
this (running) is the hardest thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"And here I am, right now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Storytelling Ambition 
</P>
<P>
Where he is, is touring in support of his book and realigning cynical 
interviewers who presume he is interested solely in movie and paperback money. 
"I made enough from selling the agency to be superannuated for life," he says. 
Nor is he lusting for the prestige of best-seller lists. "I only want to be 
there so that people will read my story." 
</P>
<P>
For he sees himself "as an absorber of human beings, and the human condition 
absolutely fascinates me. So this second part of my life is to be a 
storyteller, not to be a popular novelist, not to write a grand story." 
</P>
<P>
He is intrigued by the subjection of the human spirit and how freedom of that 
spirit, freedom of voice and freedom of the right to be oneself is increasingly 
denied, more so in the Free World. 
</P>
<P>
And he believes that progress is not always attained by choosing intellectual 
reasoning over emotional exertion. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I wrote 'Power of One' is that I had been at a dinner party and had 
heard the usual intellectual crap about apartheid . . . everybody is against 
it, everybody over-intellectualizes it, they all know the writers who write 
about it, so on and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
"I got home and said: 'Nothing ever gets done unless you feel it emotionally. 
Nothing is wrought by logic. It is all wrought by emotions.' 
</P>
<P>
"I thought: 'I'm going to write about apartheid. Not as a statement. Not as a 
flaming sword. I am going to write it so that people feel it.' " 
</P>
<P>
And what greater vessel could there be, he reasoned, than the non-judgmental 
perspective of a child growing up within apartheid? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rediscovering the Child 
</P>
<P>
The only difficulty would be in re-creating the clear reasoning and 
receptiveness of a child. So Courtenay studied hypnotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned very quickly how to age-regress myself down to being 5 years old," 
he said. But it was not a pleasant reclamation. "I used to hate going down 
there because I used to come out with dreadful tears," he said. "I was just a 
small child crying. But I understood how 5-year-olds can hurt, very deeply, and 
not just because they have been rejected but from loneliness and fear and 
confusion." 
</P>
<P>
As a storyteller, Courtenay says, he wants to deliver only one message: That 
life's pulse is set by love, freedom and human concern for others. "I don't 
want to find beautiful and spiritual answers. I don't want to find wonderfully 
smooth, intellectualized ideas." 
</P>
<P>
"The storyteller," he says, "has only one right: To point out that the human 
spirit exists and when it touches us we do things which are valuable. And when 
we deny it, we cease to be valuable." 
</P>
<P>
Since caves and the coughs of animal predators in the time between light and 
darkness, he believes, storytellers have been society's release from fear and 
loneliness. Today, their opponents are cynicism, snobbery and intellectual 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"The most remarkable words that have ever been created are: 'Once upon a time . 
. . ' " he said. "Whenever you say it, you can feel everybody opening up. 
Somebody is going to enchant me with simplicity and a story about things that I 
love, cherish and understand." 
</P>
<P>
Of the great storytellers, he explained, Dickens said: "Life doesn't have to be 
like this, it can be better." Sir Walter Scott noted: "The common man in each 
of us, even though the man is an aristocrat." 
</P>
<P>
Courtenay says he is saying: "You don't have to be circumspect, you don't have 
to be knackered (worn down) to live life, you don't have to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
As with storytellers from Matill Makejoye to Garrison Keillor, Courtenay is a 
terminal romantic. 
</P>
<P>
So, during a book promotion visit to South Africa, he drove back to find the 
home where it all began. It was a 400-kilometer journey. He arrived at 6 a.m. 
and climbed a hill to see and photograph his mother's little house as it 
reappeared through the dawn mist. 
</P>
<P>
"When the mists cleared, it wasn't there," he said. "It had been demolished. 
</P>
<P>
"I must confess I started to laugh because it was so corny, so melodramatic and 
the moment so beautifully punctuated with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"The human permanence had disappeared. Nature had won again."

AFTER A GREEK TRAGEDY; 
</P>
<P>
HER LIFE AS A POLITICAL WIFE OVER, MARGARET PAPANDREOU BOUNCES BACK TO LIFELONG 
CAUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In June the 38-year marriage of Andreas and Margaret Papandreou, he then prime 
minister of Greece, she his American-born wife, ended in divorce. The divorce 
was preceded by three years of rumor, scandal and tawdry evidence of what was 
at first an indiscreet affair and later a public romance between Papandreou, 
70, and Dimitra Liani, 34, a former talk-show hostess and airline flight 
attendant. 
</P>
<P>
It was high drama on a world stage, and it and a $200-million banking scandal 
reportedly involving him and his aides created a wake that contributed to 
Papandreou's election defeat two days after the divorce. The former prime 
minister married Liani in July and is the subject of a criminal investigation 
undertaken by the Greek parliament. 
</P>
<P>
World stage or not, what happened to Margaret Papandreou, 65, is a cliche that 
crosses all lines of class, culture, nationality and religion: Her husband left 
her for a younger woman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An International Feminist Leader 
</P>
<P>
Prestige and stature as a international feminist leader, peace movement 
activist and informal diplomat provide no fortress against that kind of pain 
and public humiliation. Nor was the ridicule and repudiation her husband 
received in some circles (and admiration from others), much of a buffer. 
</P>
<P>
And yet here she is, six weeks after the divorce, in Los Angeles on behalf of a 
bold new venture, looking pleasantly calm and determined for the most part, 
looking forward, seeming assured. 
</P>
<P>
After all this, how is she? 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm fine. I've come to terms with the situation. It was a bitch," she 
said with finality. "Fortunately, I had some very wonderful persons who were 
supportive of me. I think I have a good future ahead of me, good friends, 
wonderful family and some career I believe in." 
</P>
<P>
She paused a moment and then said softly, but deliberately, "I'll always 
treasure that portion of my life I had with Andreas. I do not want to spoil it 
with thoughts of revenge. That's hard to do at times, but I do not want to 
spoil it. Out of it came four wonderful children and that I will always 
treasure." 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou was relaxing one morning last week, in a blue caftan, in the home of 
old friends of hers and her former husband's from UC Berkeley days, Betty and 
Stanley Sheinbaum. 
</P>
<P>
If she did not seem ebullient, it must be noted, that has seldom been her 
manner. She is a serious woman, a fact she joked about publicly later that 
evening. She was 
</P>
<P>
resting up this morning, in fact, between speeches -- a private fund-raiser the 
night before, and a public event to come that evening, both for the same new 
venture, part of the good future she sees ahead of her. 
</P>
<P>
That night, she spoke before a packed church in Santa Monica where the 
spillover crowd sat on the floors and in choir pews on the altar. She had 
decided to lighten up, she began, having been stung recently by a comment that 
got back to her from a TV talk show that turned down an appearance by her. The 
word had been: "Oh, she's so serious." 
</P>
<P>
"Is that the image I gave?" she said she asked herself, quickly concluding, 
"How could it be otherwise? What am I supposed to say? 'The world is on a path 
of nuclear holocaust which may be the end of the human race. Ha, ha ha?' " 
After a similar comment about the ecology, she concluded, "It's not that I'm so 
serious. The subject is serious." 
</P>
<P>
To her listeners' delight, she then proceeded to tell a series of social gaffes 
she had made as wife of the prime minister, including one where she mistook a 
Norwegian diplomat, a stranger to her, for George Bush, patting him on the back 
at a reception with "Where's your wife?" To the man's flustered explanation 
that his wife was in Norway, she blurted out, equally flustered, "Oh, my 
husband's out of town, too." 
</P>
<P>
Then on to the serious stuff: the specter of nuclear holocaust, a global 
economic and political collapse, and an ecological disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"The three nightmares are not unrelated," she told her audience of about 400. 
"They are all connected to the global war system we're a part of." The way out, 
she said, lies in the combined philosophies of the women's movement, peace 
movement and ecology movement, all of which seek a turning away from violence 
and domination in favor of partnership and a sense of connection. 
</P>
<P>
The event was sponsored by the the Center for Partnership Studies, a new 
L.A.-based institution founded by feminist writer Riane Eisler, whose book "The 
Chalice and the Blade" reinterprets and rethinks anthropology and history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Ambitious Project 
</P>
<P>
Eisler, who also spoke at the events, and Papandreou are teaming up for an 
ambitious project, inspired by Eisler's research on the ancient Minoan 
civilization on Crete, a Greek island in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
For about 4,000 years, starting in 6000 BC, Crete is believed by many to have 
been a technologically advanced, artistic and socially harmonious society, 
where nature -- in the form of the Goddess of Nature -- was worshiped, war and 
tyranny abhorred and law prevailed. Men and women were fairly equal, and there 
is evidence, Papandreou said, of a more equitable distribution of resources 
than there is in the world today. Much of Eisler's research concentrates on 
Minoan Crete as a prime example of previous social organization that worked 
better, Papandreou noted, than the current model based on a struggle for 
domination among nations, between the sexes and between man and nature. 
</P>
<P>
Calling Eisler a visionary idealist in contact with history, archeology and 
philosophy, and herself a pragmatic idealist involved in redefining global 
security and dealing with military and defense establishments in the East and 
West, she said they made a good team. 
</P>
<P>
The team of Eisler and Papandreou is organizing an international conference and 
arts celebration in Crete, she said, in 1991 on "women, partnership and peace." 
Sponsored by Eisler's Center and Women for a Meaningful Summit -- a loosely 
organized global peace network for which Papandreou serves as international 
liaison -- the conference will "work on a rational plan for a new world social 
organization which recognizes that the road to the future is based on human 
values and social arrangement, of equality between the sexes, of nonviolence in 
personal and public behavior." 
</P>
<P>
That may sound visionary to the point of uselessness, but not as Papandreou 
sees it. 
</P>
<P>
In describing her dealings with a U.S. State Department careerist, she said the 
official regarded groups like hers as being somewhat "off with the butterflies 
and pansies." Not a bad place to be, Papandreou said. "I think we are the only 
ones talking Realpolitik," she said, considering the seriousness of the 
situation and the drastic measures needed to turn things around. "Our kind (of 
solution) is the only kind that will work." 
</P>
<P>
Variously called Margarita or Margaret, she is known to her friends as Maggie, 
this lanky Midwesterner with blond hair and blue eyes who was born Margaret 
Chant in 1923 and grew up in Elmhurst, Ill. The oldest of five children, she 
has often said her family was fairly well off before the Depression; after it, 
wiped out and poor. 
</P>
<P>
Her grandfather was a socialist and when she was 12 she campaigned for his 
unsuccessful Senate run on the American Socialist ticket. She has been involved 
in politics and committed to the principles of socialism ever since. As for 
feminism, she has often described not being able to understand why she, too, 
couldn't try out for the basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
She worked her way through the University of Minnesota, graduated and opened a 
public relations office in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
She met Andreas in Minneapolis in 1948. From the start, she has 
</P>
<P>
said, they found they had the same political philosophy. She was 24; he 29, 
married and teaching economics at the university. They had a brief affair and 
went their separate ways. She married briefly. Then, in 1951, after they had 
both divorced, they were married in 1951, and soon moved to UC Berkeley where 
he eventually chaired the economics department. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou had been in self-imposed exile in this country since 1940, had 
served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and become a citizen. He returned 
to Greece on a Fulbright scholarship in 1959 with his wife and four children -- 
three sons and a daughter -- and finally moved back to stay in 1961. When his 
father George became prime minister in 1964, he was elected to Parliament, but 
with the overthrow of the king, the Constitution and the government by a 
military junta in 1967, he was imprisoned as a leftist. Later, after he was 
freed, he and his family went into exile in Sweden and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The family returned to Greece in 1974 after the junta was driven out. 
Papandreou, with Margaret and their son as founding members, formed the 
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), was elected to Parliament in 1977 and 
in 1981 became prime minister, bringing in Greece's first socialist government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Organized Feminists 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his wife had not been idle. Once back in Greece, Margaret Papandreou 
and several friends formed the Union of Greek Women, a socialist feminist group 
that organized women in urban and rural areas and successfully worked for 
changes in the civil code -- especially the family law section, legalizing 
civil marriage, eliminating the dowry, enabling women to be heads of household. 
Recently Greek women gained the right to free and legal abortions. Papandreou 
served as Union president from 1980 until she resigned recently. 
</P>
<P>
Having seen the Union grow from a group of 20 to an organization of 30,000, she 
said that despite her resignation, she would still work with the women's 
movement in Greece. Progress has been made in changing laws and attitudes, she 
said, but there are still barriers for women entering politics. Papandreou led 
Greece's delegation to the United Nations conference on women in Nairobi in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
It was about that time that Women for a Meaningful Summit started as a loose 
coalition of American women seeking to have an influence on the 
Reagan/Gorbachev meeting on nuclear disarmament in Geneva. It stayed together, 
and soon expanded internationally. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou has played a highly visible role in the organization, leading 
delegations to summit meetings, meeting with American and Soviet government 
officials, with NATO and Warsaw Pact officials, bringing "peace platforms," the 
concerns and commentary of feminists to the attention of the decision-makers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Her New Status 
</P>
<P>
It is work she plans to continue, although she acknowledged her new status as 
an independent individual may affect her access. 
</P>
<P>
"It could make a difference," she said. "Because of my status as wife of a 
prime minister, it was a little easier to get the ear of someone in public 
office. I think most of the things, I can still do now and will. If it's more 
difficult, I'll just have to push harder." 
</P>
<P>
She does not avoid reference to the past, including the breakup of her 
marriage. She easily incorporates references to Andreas, to experiences she had 
as wife of the prime minister, to memories of her father-in-law, George, and 
the personally excruciating time she has recently been through. 
</P>
<P>
But it is mainly a matter of passing reference or slightly abstracted 
observation. She does not wear her heart on her sleeve for strangers or seem 
compelled to bare her soul. Even her personal revelations soon get put through 
the prism with which she looks at most of life: the lens of a politician, 
activist and lifelong feminist and socialist. 
</P>
<P>
She has a lot to look at and evaluate now and she intends to turn to writing 
for that work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Way of Sorting' 
</P>
<P>
Author of two children's books, on feminism and anti-imperialism, written in 
Greek, and an account of life under the junta, called, "Nightmare in Athens," 
she said she likes to write and called it a learning experience, "a way of 
sorting things out. You get different insights regarding behavior and events 
that do not occur to you at the time. It's an exciting part of putting the 
puzzle together." 
</P>
<P>
She has a book in mind now that she wants to get started on. 
</P>
<P>
Oh? 
</P>
<P>
"Not a 'kiss and tell' book," she smiled wryly. 
</P>
<P>
She could command a pretty penny if she chose to go that route. 
</P>
<P>
"You bet I could," she said with a flash of fire. But "if I do a book, mainly 
it will have something to do with political life in Greece and being the wife 
of the prime minister. I would look at my personal experience and functioning 
in political chambers from a feminist point of view." 
</P>
<P>
She has some notes, she said, and would like to set aside some time this year 
to get started. Beyond that, she plans another book on political wives, 
focusing to some extent to the restrictions placed on their personal and 
professional activities for the sake of their husbands' image. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to her has happened to women from all walks of life, she knows. 
Some come up to her, she said, anxious to talk to her, fearful her experience 
is a forerunner of what's in store for them. Or having already gone through it, 
they want to know how she has survived. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a formula maybe -- men getting old and looking for younger wives," she 
remarked. 
</P>
<P>
Her outlook is as much sobering as it is reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hardest Hit 
</P>
<P>
"So many women have (confronted), or are going to confront, it. They should be 
prepared for it. When this happens, people often say they feel like a part of 
their body has been cut off. It's a way of saying that person is being a part 
of you rather than close to you but separate." 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit, she said, are those women who have made marriage their whole life. 
"Beyond their economic dependence, they've had their whole profession taken 
away from them." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, "I was fortunate when this present problem hit me. I was very 
active, independent of being the wife of Andreas Papandreou." 
</P>
<P>
Men, she said, tend to put careers first, families second. Women put their 
families first and don't always have a "second." What such women go through, 
she said, bears some similarity to a man's losing his job -- depression, panic, 
loss of self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"When your main activity in life is withdrawn from you, it really hits you. So 
if family is going to be your main concern, it's good to have a second 
(involvement) and it should be something connected with other people." 
</P>
<P>
She is a little surprised that so many assume she will return to the States to 
live, as she phrases it, "because my marriage broke up." She has dual 
citizenship in both countries, but plans to live in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family and Friends 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent almost half of my life in Greece since 1959," she said. Of America, 
she said, "My development stage, my values system were developed here." She has 
family and friends here, and said, "This is home for me, but Greece is home as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
It is where her daughter Sophia, 34, and sons, George 37, and Nicholas, 33, and 
her two grandchildren, are. Her youngest son, Andreas, 30, now studying at 
Harvard, plans to return at some point. 
</P>
<P>
"I have other reasons, my work, my career. And I really love Greece. I think 
it's kind of nice to have at least two countries that are home." 
</P>
<P>
She wears two plain bands on her left ring finger, one silver, one gold. Could 
they possibly be her wedding rings? 
</P>
<P>
"They're my replacements," she said with a laugh. "I wore my wedding rings 
until the day the divorce was final. But when I took them off, after 38 years, 
my hand felt so bare I looked through my jewelry box to find something else." 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, in the Sheinbaums' airy living room, as she was ready to escort 
her visitor to the door, Papandreou stood with her hand extended, gazing down 
at the substitute rings. Smiling fondly, and without looking up, she recalled 
how she and her husband had been married in Nevada and had designed matching 
silver bands that were reminiscent of American Indian jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Looking far from revenge, and very far from defeat, she said laughingly, "I 
suppose I'll have to come up with a name for these. Independence rings. Maybe 
that's what they are." 
</P>

RETAILERS ARE IN THE CHIPS, THANKS TO THE BLOSSOMING POPULARITY OF DANCING 
FLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Pee-wee Herman, hear this: You're not the only one with partying posies in your 
playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
From shimmying sunflowers to twisting cattleyas, Rock'N Flowers, plastic 
blossoms that boogie to music, are fast replacing the Pet Rock of recent past 
as the toy of today. 
</P>
<P>
Manufactured in Tokyo and distributed by WACO Products Corp. in Fairfield, 
N.J., the wild bunch of sunglass-wearing and instrument-carrying flowers bop to 
hip-hop sounds thanks to the magic of a concealed microchip. The chip gets its 
dance fever from two AA batteries in the flower's faux terra-cotta pot. 
</P>
<P>
Priced at $29.95 each, the floral four (hibiscus, gerberas, sunflowers and 
cattleyas) are the rage in Japan and proving to be just as popular in selected 
cities in the United States, says Monica Cesareo, publicist for the New Jersey 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Available only in California, New York, Texas and parts of New England, Rock'N 
Flowers are the hottest-selling novelty item on store shelves, salespeople 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the new Pet Rock -- we've sold over 2,000 of them in 10 days and had 
to reorder several times," says Cheryl Fox, publicist for Bullock's, whose 
Century City location has had its cash registers ringing with sales of the 
whimsical flora. 
</P>
<P>
At the Beverly Center's Future Tronics, where for a month a window full of hip 
hibiscus has stopped mall traffic, sales are reported at 100-plus potted plants 
per day. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about flower power. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had anything like this before. We've had to reorder, sometimes 
twice in one day," says the store's district manager, Mohammad Sharifzadeh. 
"Everybody who passes by stops to look at them. And then they come inside and 
want to figure out how they work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fodder for Frenzy 
</P>
<P>
A booming boom box, a turned-up high-tech stereo system, even nonstop talk can 
send the flowers into a nonstop frenzy. Standing at 12 inches, the flowers have 
stems that can be shaped into a squiggly, slightly curved or straight-up 
positions, giving each bud a personality of its own when the music plays. 
Depending on the preferred performance, they can wriggle like Charo or twist 
like Chubby. 
</P>
<P>
At Future Tronics, Mark Kruh, a self-described 29-year-old yuppie with a 
penchant for the latest trend, was stopped in his tracks by the dancing 
display. Minutes later, a couple of dance-crazy sunflowers ("Everyone needs a 
partner," he says) were en route to Kruh's West Hollywood digs. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia Mendoza, the mother of a teen-age son with "dreams of becoming the next 
Jon Bon Jovi," also bought a guitar-carrying sunflower for her future rocker. 
</P>
<P>
"He's into heavy metal," she says. "And I just think these things are cute. 
They make me laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Cesareo says WACO plans to launch full-scale nationwide distribution of the 
budding dancers in stores this fall: "It's trendy and there's nothing out there 
like it right now. That's the attraction." 
</P>
<P>
Think of it, adds Mark Hennessy, a Future Tronics salesman. "It's just the 
beginning. Who knows what the microchip will bring next?" 
</P>
<P>
Maybe a moonwalking marigold? Or a bat-dancing begonia? How about vogueing 
violets? Whatever gyrates in your electronic garden, the best part will be that 
it won't require a green thumb.

DEATH SENTENCE IN 3 MURDERS UPHELD

<P>
The state Supreme Court today upheld the death sentence of a Los Angeles man 
for murdering two men and a woman during a drug-related robbery in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-1 decision in the case of Jesse James Andrews, 39, was the first majority 
opinion by Justice Joyce L. Kennard, appointed to the court by Gov. George 
Deukmejian in April. The only dissenter, Justice Stanley Mosk, said Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Aurelio Munoz should have told jurors that they could 
consider showing mercy to Andrews. Mosk said the jury instructions suggested 
improperly that "the exercise of mercy was in fact illegitimate."

'DOVE' COUP: 18 EMMY NOMINATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
MINISERIES LEADS CBS TO NARROW GAP WITH NO. 1 NBC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
CBS' Western miniseries "Lonesome Dove" rustled up 18 nominations and its 
first-year comedy "Murphy Brown" collected 11 today as the network that 
finished third in the ratings last season nearly caught front-runner NBC in the 
competition for the 41st annual nighttime Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
CBS received 95 of the 364 nominations announced by the Academy of Television 
Arts &amp; Sciences, second only to the 103 garnered by ratings champion NBC, 
which had dominated the nominations for the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
"Lonesome Dove," the eight-hour adaptation of Larry McMurtry's novel that aired 
last February, led all other programs with its 18 nominations, including one as 
best miniseries of the 1988-89 season. Nominations also went to Robert Duvall 
and Tommy Lee Jones as best actor, Diane Lane and Anjelica Houston as best 
actress, Danny Glover as best supporting actor and Glenne Headly as best 
supporting actress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best Drama Series 
</P>
<P>
The NBC legal drama "L.A. Law" collected 17 nominations, including one as best 
drama series. Its competition: CBS' "Beauty and the Beast," ABC's "China 
Beach," CBS' "Wiseguy" and last year's winner, ABC's "thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
"Murphy Brown," which stars Candice Bergen as a smart-mouthed television 
journalist, was nominated as best comedy series along with another CBS show, 
"Designing Women," and three former winners in that category: ABC's "Wonder 
Years," which won last year; NBC's "The Golden Girls," which won in 1986 and 
1987, and NBC's "Cheers," which won in 1983 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen also won a nomination as best actress in a comedy, as did the three 
stars of "Golden Girls" -- Betty White, Beatrice Arthur and Rue McClanahan -- 
and Blair Brown of the Lifetime cable series "The Days and Molly Dodd." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cable Nominations 
</P>
<P>
Brown's nomination was one of 16 that cable programming received in its second 
year of eligibility for the nighttime Emmys, with HBO accounting for half of 
those. Among other broadcasters, ABC got 85 nominations, PBS garnered 32, 
syndicated shows got 21 and the Fox Broadcasting network picked up 12 -- 10 for 
its comedy series "The Tracy Ullman Show." 
</P>
<P>
Winners will be announced Sept. 17 in ceremonies at the Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium that will be televised by Fox Broadcasting.

2 KILLED AFTER MATTRESS FIRE SETS PALMDALE BOARDING HOUSE ABLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mattress fire set a boarding house in Palmdale ablaze early today, killing 
two men who lived there, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Fire Investigator David Westfield said officials believe 
that the blaze was accidental. The names of the victims, ages 57 and 78, were 
withheld pending notification of relatives. The victims were roommates who were 
overcome by smoke and died at the scene, Westfield said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the eight other residents suffered a seizure and was treated at Palmdale 
Hospital Medical Center and released, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported about 3:31 a.m. by a passing motorist who was flagged 
down by a resident, Westfield said. He said the occupants first tried to call 
the Fire Department with a phone in the burning building, but the fire 
apparently interfered with the phone lines. That delay may have led to the 
deaths of the victims, one of whom was an amputee with a prosthetic leg, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It took 17 firefighters to extinguish the blaze. Neighbors and officials said 
many of the residents of the boarding house in a desert area on the edge of 
Palmdale were low-income or elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Harris, a cook and caretaker at the home, said he was awakened by 
another resident yelling that a mattress was on fire. He said the smoke was so 
thick that he was forced to climb out a back window. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said their initial investigation indicated that the building had 
properly functioning smoke detectors.

DEMOCRATS IN SENATE SNUB PRESIDENT'S CLEAN AIR BILL

President Bush's clean air bill was introduced in the Senate today with just 
three Democratic co-sponsors, and an Administration official blamed Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell for the lack of bipartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
The three Democrats joined 21 Republican sponsors after the Administration 
conducted a vigorous recruitment drive among Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
A source at the Environmental Protection Agency, speaking only on the condition 
he not be named, said agency Administrator William K. Reilly became so upset 
with Democratic attacks on the bill that he called Mitchell to complain. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell of Maine, the chief sponsor of past clean air legislation that failed 
to pass, said July 25 that the Bush bill "avoided virtually every tough choice" 
in forcing cities and industries to clean the nation's skies. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Quinn, the EPA's congressional liaison, called the paucity of Senate 
Democratic sponsors "a reflection of unexpected partisan tactics by the 
majority leader's office. We made the same kind of effort (to line up sponsors) 
as we did in the House," where 57 Democrats and 90 Republicans backed the 
legislation. "It's a rather shocking disparity. Reilly feels that's very 
unfortunate and wants to avoid any partisanship in the debate." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA source said Reilly, in his call to Mitchell, made a similar point, 
stressing he "does not want to get off to a partisan start in the clean air 
debate. Mitchell said he had real concerns about (Administration proposals) on 
ozone and toxic (chemicals) and auto emissions." 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats who backed the bill were Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, John 
B. Breaux of Louisiana and J. James Exon of Nebraska.

UPLAND POLICE ARREST 2 TEEN-AGERS IN SUSPECTED MURDER OF BOY, 9

<P>
Upland police today arrested two teen-age suspects in the disappearance and 
suspected murder of a 9-year-old boy missing since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Kevin Cushman said a search is under way at an undisclosed site for 
the body of Jason Matthew Lea and predicted that officers will arrest two other 
youths in connection with the case later today. The identities of the 
16-year-old suspects were not released. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 p.m. Saturday, Jason told his grandfather he was going for a bike ride to 
Upland High School, not far from his apartment on Orchid Court. Shortly 
thereafter, witnesses saw the boy playing video games at an arcade on W. 
Foothill Boulevard, but he was not seen leaving. 
</P>
<P>
Jason's grandfather, Jerry Yeager, with whom the boy has lived for six years, 
found the youth's bicycle outside James Games Family Fun Center arcade at 10 
p.m. Saturday. Police had been searching for the missing boy since then. Late 
Wednesday, detectives received information from two independent sources that 
prompted the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"He was such a nice boy," recalled a neighbor, Alice Lopez. "The first thing 
that hit you was that great big smile."

ORANGE COUNTY HOLDING SEATTLE TEEN, 2 OTHERS IN MOTHER'S DEATH

A 15-year-old Seattle boy who turned himself in to Garden Grove police is one 
of three youths suspected in the stabbing death of his mother, Seattle 
detectives said today. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Donohoe, a spokesman for the King County prosecutor's office, said the boy 
left Seattle after his mother was found dead in her apartment July 26. The 
woman, Ange May Reed, had been stabbed in the face and the neck. 
</P>
<P>
The boy called Garden Grove police from a telephone booth at Bolsa Grande High 
School about 8:15 p.m. Wednesday and later was arrested, Garden Grove Lt. John 
Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was taken to Orange County Juvenile Hall in Orange, where Seattle 
detectives were to pick him up today to face first-degree murder charges in 
Seattle, Seattle police spokesman Don Church said. 
</P>
<P>
Donohoe said the boy discussed killing his mother with two friends, one of whom 
later carried out the stabbing. Donohoe said the other youth, a juvenile, is 
also wanted on suspicion of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Donohoe said all three of the youths are members of a Seattle-area gang and 
fled Washington for California after Reed's death. Seattle police apparently 
knew that the boy was heading to Orange County and issued a bulletin alerting 
Orange County authorities, Garden Grove Police Lt. Chuck Gibbs said.

A Studio City man driving a Corvette more than 100 m.p.h. on the Hollywood 
Freeway was killed when he lost control of the car and crashed, the California 
Highway Patrol said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Georgianni, 47, was killed in the 11:40 p.m. accident Wednesday, CHP 
Officer Dave Grajeda said. The victim had been heading south on the freeway at 
speeds ranging from 100 to 115 m.p.h. when the car went out of control on a 
curve north of Chandler Avenue, Grajeda said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1974 Corvette with an open T-top spun several times across traffic lanes, 
struck a light pole and rolled down an embankment into trees, Grajeda said. 
Georgianni, who was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown from the car, which 
landed on top of him, Grajeda said. 
</P>
<P>
Georgianni died at the scene. No other vehicles were involved, Grajeda said.

NEWS LEAK SOURCES WILL FACE PROSECUTION, ATTY. GEN. WARNS

Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said today he would not prosecute reporters who 
obtain news leaks about criminal investigations but would charge federal 
officials who are their sources. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said a new policy of prosecuting officials who leak details of 
criminal investigations for theft of government property does not include 
charging reporters with aiding and abetting or receiving such information. 
</P>
<P>
"The statute clearly calls for prosecution of those involved in misusing 
sensitive information that comes to them in an official capacity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Previous policy was not to use that authority. We have changed that because of 
reasons I've stated more often than you want to hear," the attorney general 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Accurate leaks "have a tendency to compromise ongoing investigations," he said. 
"If they are inaccurate, they have a tendency to unjustifiably smear the 
reputations of persons who are the subject of the leak." 
</P>
<P>
The revision of the department's 11-year-old policy, intended to protect 
whistle-blowers and reporters from prosecution, was announced Wednesday in 
testimony submitted to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
News reporters might be questioned about their sources in a grand jury, under 
the policy, if the attorney general approves the subpoena. Attorneys general 
historically have been reluctant to subpoena reporters -- often the only source 
of information about news leaks.

Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson switched his voting registration from 
Chicago to Washington today but was coy about whether he will run for mayor of 
the nation's capital against incumbent Marion Barry. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if registration was a step toward running for mayor next year, the 
47-year-old minister joked, "This is just a few feet away from the White 
House." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who has never held public office but finished second to Michael S. 
Dukakis in a crowded field seeking the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, 
moved his legal residence here over the weekend from his longtime Chicago base, 
which would make him eligible if he decides to seek office here in 1990.

ABA PANEL CALLS FLAG PROPOSALS IRRESPONSIBLE 
</P>

<P>
A prestigious American Bar Assn. committee that includes former Nixon and 
Carter Administration officials concluded in blunt language today that efforts 
to enact either a constitutional amendment or a bill to outlaw flag desecration 
are unneeded and irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
In a 16-page report to the ABA, meeting in Hawaii, the committee said the 
nation's commitment to freedom of expression will be damaged by any attempt to 
reverse a Supreme Court ruling that Americans have a right to burn the flag as 
a political protest. 
</P>
<P>
"All through human history, tyrannies have tried to enforce obedience by 
prohibiting disrespect for the symbols of their power," the task force said. 
"The American flag commands respect and love because of our country's adherence 
to its values and its promise of freedom, not because of fiat and criminal 
law." 
</P>
<P>
Headed by former Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Randolph Thrower, an 
appointee of then-President Richard M. Nixon, the panel will ask the ABA's 
policy-making House of Delegates to endorse its report next week during a 
convention in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
The committee said that because Congress appears to be rushing toward some 
action, the ABA should go on record opposing either legislation or a 
constitutional amendment to reverse the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers have "a special obligation to defend the Constitution and its cardinal 
principles," the task force said. 
</P>
<P>
"We agree that the burning of the American flag as a form of political protest 
is very offensive to the vast majority of our citizens," the panel said. But, 
"it is just when people take great offense because of disrespect shown to an 
honored symbol that the right of free expression needs protection, not 
prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration and leading Republicans in Congress support a 
constitutional amendment that would permit states to outlaw flag desecration. 
Democratic leaders in Congress are sponsoring legislation to make flag 
desecration a crime. 
</P>
<P>
The high court on June 21 ruled that Texas improperly prosecuted a man who 
burned the flag at a protest during the Republican National Convention in 
Dallas in 1984. The ruling apparently invalidated flag desecration laws of 48 
states and the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the ABA task force are Barbara Black, dean of Columbia 
University Law School; Warren Christopher, deputy secretary of state under 
Jimmy Carter; Erwin Griswold, former dean of Harvard Law School and solicitor 
general in the Nixon Administration; Prof. Gerald Gunther of Stanford 
University Law School; Robert McKay, former dean of New York University Law 
School; Earl Silbert, a U.S. attorney appointed by Nixon, and Cyrus Vance, 
secretary of state under Carter.

S&amp;L BAILOUT PASSED DESPITE VETO THREAT; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSE APPROVES PLAN OVER OPPOSITION FROM BUSH ON INCLUDING COSTS IN DEFICIT

<P>
The House today passed and sent to the Senate a $159-billion bailout of the 
savings and loan industry, defying a last-minute veto threat from President 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The 221-199 vote set up a confrontation in the Senate where minority 
Republicans vowed to block passage in hopes of forcing Democrats into 
negotiations with the White House over the bailout's financing plan. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said in his veto threat that he hoped for agreement on a new bill by 
Friday when Congress is scheduled to begin a monthlong recess. Final 
congressional action on the measure would give the Administration the money 
necessary to close or merge hundreds of insolvent S &amp; Ls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Enough for Override 
</P>
<P>
The vote in the House was short of the two-thirds needed to override a veto. 
Supporting the bill were 182 Democrats and 39 Republicans. Voting against it 
were 67 Democrats and 132 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to congressional leaders, Bush complained that the legislation, as 
adopted by a House-Senate conference last week, sets a precedent that could 
undermine the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. 
</P>
<P>
The President called for a compromise on the thorny issue before the House and 
Senate adjourn for the August recess. 
</P>
<P>
But Democratic leaders rebuffed him. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
of Maine said Bush's proposal for calculating the cost of the bailout was 
"fiscal gimmickry at its worst" that would add $5 billion in interest costs. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's objection to the Democratic plan centers on the method for calculating 
the cost in the federal deficit. The legislation would balloon the budget 
deficit, but the bailout cost would not be included in calculations requiring 
automatic spending cuts in federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
Bush favors evading the cuts by simply keeping the spending out of the deficit 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats complain that the President's method, which requires that a private 
agency borrow bailout money, will inflate borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Way to Compromise' 
</P>
<P>
"To charge the American people more to hide budget costs is a crime, and we're 
not backing off," said Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a member of the House 
Banking Committee. "There's no way to compromise. It's cutting the baby in 
half." 
</P>
<P>
The veto message threatened one of the critical pieces of legislation making 
its way through Congress this year. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, in response to the worst financial crisis since the 
Depression, would pump $50 billion into government deposit insurance funds 
depleted by hundreds of S &amp; L failures due to poor, and often fraudulent, 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
It also would institute a major overhaul of the government's regulation of the 
nation's nearly 3,000 thrifts and require their owners to put billions of 
dollars more of their own money at risk.

NBC-TV won the July sweeps in what amounts to a battle of the network reruns, 
according to figures released today. 
</P>
<P>
The July sweeps, because of the preponderance of repeats, are considered the 
least significant of the four sweeps periods each year, in which the ratings 
companies measure the viewing habits of audiences in 200 markets. The other 
sweeps periods are November, February and May. 
</P>
<P>
This marks the sixth consecutive sweeps victory for NBC, and the fifth July 
sweeps win in a row. For the period from July 6 to Aug. 2, NBC had a 10.9 
rating and a 21 share. ABC was second with a 9.0 rating and a 17 share, barely 
edging out CBS, which had an 8.9 rating and a 17 share. Fox Broadcasting had a 
6.4 rating and a 13 share.

TEXACO AND EXXON TO FIGHT $2-BILLION IRS TAX BILL

Texaco Inc. and Exxon Corp. said the Internal Revenue Service is seeking more 
than $2 billion in taxes from 1979 to 1982, when the companies purchased cheap 
oil from Saudi Arabia, published reports said today. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco said Wednesday that the IRS claims that the oil company owes $1.79 
billion in taxes from 1979 to 1981, when it sold oil to its affiliates at 
below-market value. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Corp. said the IRS has billed it $269 million for 1979 in connection with 
oil that the government of Saudi Arabia sold to Exxon and Texaco in a bid to 
stabilize the world crude market. Interest on the Exxon payments could double 
the amount of money the IRS seeks. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon said it has filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court in Washington over the 
IRS bill. Texaco said it also will fight the IRS claim. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco and Exxon said that for three years the Saudis sold the oil cheaply on 
the condition that it be sold at $4 to $6 a barrel below market, the Wall 
Street Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco said the IRS is seeking $863 million in back taxes and $925 million in 
interest because it said Texaco should have charged the market price when it 
sold the oil to its affiliates, the New York Times said. 
</P>
<P>
The refining operations, most of them overseas, reaped huge profits when they 
sold the end products.

Congress should consider reviving regulation of the cable TV industry, a 
General Accounting Office spokesman said today after unveiling a survey showing 
basic cable rates have risen 29% in two years since deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time to fully re-examine re-regulation," John M. Olf Jr., 
director of housing and community development issues for the GAO, told a House 
subcommittee. "With no competition, no limited regulation, I believe we have a 
monopoly." 
</P>
<P>
But an industry spokesman said consumers are getting their money's worth from 
cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Cable subscribers are getting a lot more for their money than was the case 16 
years ago or even three years ago," James P. Mooney, president and chief 
executive officer of the National Cable Television Assn., told the Energy and 
Commerce Committee's telecommunications and finance subcommittee.

The National Transportation Safety Board voted today to oppose the public 
broadcast of airline cockpit voice recordings after crashes and indicated that 
it will support legislation to keep the tapes secret. 
</P>
<P>
The board said it was in the interest of safety to keep the tapes confidential 
and not made available for what one member called "the lurid entertainment of 
the public." 
</P>
<P>
The five-member board voted unanimously to support the position of the Federal 
Aviation Administration and the Air Line Pilots Assn. in deploring the 
court-ordered release of a recording from a Delta Air Lines plane that crashed 
in Dallas a year ago. That tape captured the voices of crew members joking 
about politics and airliner accidents and also screaming just before the crash.

Michael Chang beat fellow Californian Derrick Rostagno 6-3, 6-2 today to reach 
the quarterfinals of the Volvo International tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Chang had four aces and never lost more than two points on his serve. He broke 
Rostagno once in the first set and twice in the second. Rostagno had his best 
chance to break Chang when he won the first two points in the second game of 
the second set. But Chang won the next 12 points for a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the French Open and turning in a grand showing at Wimbledon, 
Chang is hoping to improve on his last U.S. Open performance. He won three 
matches in the 1988 Open before losing in straight sets to Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
With Agassi seeded first and Chang second in this week's Volvo Tournament, the 
two American teen-agers are on track for their first tournament meeting since 
the Open. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi is to play unseeded David Wheaton, a 6-1, 6-4 upset winner over No. 16 
Scott Davis, later today.

<P>
The Reds scored 14 runs in the first inning on a major-league record 16 hits 
and went on to beat the Houston Astros 18 to 2 today. 
</P>
<P>
Seven Reds had two hits off Houston starter Jim Clancy and reliever Bob Forsch 
in the first, breaking a century-old record. The previous record for most 
batters with two hits in an inning was set by Chicago against Detroit in 1883. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds fell one run short of the National League record for most runs in one 
inning, set by Brooklyn in the first inning against Cincinnati in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
The previous one-inning hit record was set by the Boston Red Sox, who had 14 
against Detroit in 1953. The NL record of 12 hits in one inning was held by the 
St. Louis Cardinals, who did it against Cincinnati in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the first-inning hits were singles, breaking another major-league 
mark. St. Louis had 11 singles against Cincinnati in 1925, and Boston tied that 
mark against Detroit in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Quinones, Eric Davis, Ken Griffey, Rolando Roomes, Todd Benzinger, Jeff 
Reed and Ron Oester all had two hits in the first inning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 16 hits broke the Reds' record of 12 in one inning, set in 1942 against the 
New York Giants and tied in 1977 against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy, 5-9, faced seven batters and retired none. He allowed seven runs on six 
hits and a walk. Forsch faced the next 13 batters, allowing 10 hits and seven 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
The first eight Reds reached base before pitcher Tom Browning grounded out. The 
Reds then pounded Forsch for nine straight hits before he retired Mariano 
Duncan and Quinones to end the inning. Duncan and Quinones tied a major-league 
record with three plate appearances in an inning. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan led off with a walk, stole second, and moved to third on a bunt single 
by Quinones. Davis singled home Duncan, and Griffey hit his seventh home run of 
the season to make it 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
Singles by Roomes, Benzinger and Reed made it 5-0 and finished Clancy. Reed 
scored on a wild pitch by Forsch, and Oester's RBI double made it 7 to 0 before 
Browning grounded out for the first out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan doubled home Oester and moved to third on Quinones' second hit of the 
inning. Davis and Griffey followed with run-scoring singles to give the Reds a 
10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Roomes' infield hit loaded the bases, which Benzinger cleared with a double, 
making it 13 to 0. Benzinger moved to third on Reed's second hit and scored on 
Oester's single. 
</P>
<P>
Browning singled to reload the bases, but Forsch retired Duncan and Quinones on 
fly balls to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds scored three more runs in the seventh and one in the eighth.

DOCTOR TESTIFIES IN PERRY RAPE CASE

<P>
Witnesses at the sexual assault trial of Denver Bronco Gerald Perry say the 
woman who accused the lineman of raping her refused to go to the hospital for 
an examination when police first contacted her. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Clarence Blea, who examined the woman when she went to the University of 
Colorado Health Sciences Center about 18 hours after the alleged assault, said 
he found no visible signs of trauma or anything else to indicate that she had 
been raped. 
</P>
<P>
Blea told the court, however, that the absence of bruises and trauma, as well 
as a pelvic examination showing no tearing or other signs of rape, doesn't mean 
that the 26-year-old woman wasn't raped. 
</P>
<P>
Blea was the first witness during the second day of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Gene Ciancio and Tom Tasker contend that the woman was a 
willing sex partner, and prosecutors Bruce Levin and Joe Pacyga say she was 
raped at gunpoint.
