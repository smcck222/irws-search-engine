HOUSE FIREBOMBED; 6 INJURED; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO WAS WATCHING TV WITH HIS FAMILY IS SEVERELY 
BURNED. AUTHORITIES HAVE NO MOTIVE FOR THE ATTACK IN INGLEWOOD.

Several homemade firebombs were hurled by youths through a window of an 
Inglewood home Wednesday night, severely burning a 12-year-old boy and injuring 
a mother and her four young children who were watching television at the time, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials seeking a motive for the attack said the eight people in the 
house were fortunate to survive the fiery explosion. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the Molotov cocktails landed in the living room, blowing a hole 
in the floor and sparking the fire that engulfed the single-family home on West 
103rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting there with a friend and the kids and all of a sudden the room 
was full of flames," said Brenda Walker, 28, who carried her month-old son to 
safety. Walker's feet were singed as she ran across the burning floor. Her baby 
suffered from minor smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell Mullen, the 12-year-old who suffered second- and third-degree burns on 
his face, back and hands, ran out of the burning house screaming, "I'm on 
fire!" said Elijah Walker Jr., 31, a brother of the boy and of Brenda Walker. 
</P>
<P>
The older brother covered the boy with a blanket to extinguish the fire before 
entering the burning house to lead the others to safety. A family friend, J.C. 
Holland, who was visiting Brenda Walker at the time of the bombing, assisted 
Walker. 
</P>
<P>
"All I heard was a big bang and then all you could see was flames," Holland 
said. "Everything happened so fast." 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for Elijah, we all would have died," Brenda Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Mullen, a sixth-grader at Lennox Middle School, was in stable condition 
Thursday at the burn center at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital, while three 
other children, who range in age from 3 to 7, were treated and released at area 
hospitals for minor burns. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said they discovered a flammable liquid and pieces of glass at 
the scene, indicating that a homemade firebomb was the cause of the blaze. They 
estimated that the small single-family home, one of three residences on the lot 
that house Walker family members, suffered $35,000 damage. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Fire Battalion Chief Kenneth Mays, who called the family "lucky to be 
alive," said arson investigators are approaching the incident as an attempted 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told investigators they saw four men in their early 20s wearing white 
T-shirts running from the home shortly after the 10:30 p.m. blaze, Mays said. 
The men threw as many as four fire bombs at the house and then fled without 
saying a word, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more evidence than we usually do for an arson investigation, so I'm 
optimistic that we'll catch the suspects," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
Mays said the motive for the attack was unknown and there did not appear to be 
any gang connection. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Walker and other family members said they had no idea who could have 
orchestrated such an attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody likes me around here," Walker said Thursday as she surveyed the 
gutted house. "I just think they got the wrong house . . . but I'm moving 
anyway. It seems like somebody is trying to kill me."

FOSTER CARE PROBE CALLED 'WITCH HUNT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that state and county officials are waging a "witch hunt" in their 
effort to identify children who may have been abused while in foster care, a 
San Fernando Valley foster mother is seeking a court order to prevent 
authorities from removing four children from her home. 
</P>
<P>
Her request for a temporary restraining order -- which her lawyer plans to 
bring in Juvenile Court today -- is part of a coordinated effort by angry 
foster parents to fight back as county officials, acting on orders from the 
state, reopen more than 650 old investigations into allegations of sexual and 
physical abuse in foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
So far, county officials have removed about 25 children from 11 foster homes as 
a result of the reopening of these complaints, some of which were first 
examined five and six years ago. Depending on the outcome of the renewed 
investigations, the children will either be returned to the parents or the 
parents may be stripped of their foster care licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The request for a temporary restraining order is being brought by foster parent 
Kathie Durand of Reseda, who said she was tipped off to the county's plans to 
remove her foster children while investigators reexamine a 3-year-old 
allegation of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Durand's dispute with the county marks the latest twist in the continuing 
troubles of the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services. The 
department, which is in the throes of a management reorganization in the wake 
of the resignation of its director, has been under attack from state officials 
for being lax about removing children and revoking the licenses of foster 
parents who have been accused of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
But as the department tries to address the state's criticisms, it has come 
under attack from foster parents who say that regulators are too quick to take 
foster children away. 
</P>
<P>
In all the cases the county is reinvestigating, the foster parents previously 
were cleared of wrongdoing. The cases were reopened after state officials in 
June seized 15 county file cabinets containing foster care records and 
discovered investigations that they say were either mishandled or incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
The county currently licenses 3,800 foster homes and has 10,000 children in 
foster care, although some of those are in other facilities. County officials 
maintain that removing some children now is necessary to ensure their safety -- 
even where complaints were made years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can prove abuse happened two years back, we're going to remove the kids 
today, even if we don't know of anything that has happened (since)," said 
Everett Harper, who supervises the department's investigative unit. 
</P>
<P>
But foster parents are complaining that children have been yanked willy-nilly 
and that uprooting the youngsters from foster parents with whom they have 
bonded causes the children psychological harm. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried sick," said foster mother Hallie Duda of Wilmington, whose six 
foster children were removed earlier this week. "My 3-year-old, she was 
screaming and crying 'Mommy, don't leave me! Don't leave me!' . . . This is a 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lupe Ross, vice president of the Los Angeles County Foster Parent Assn.: 
"It has got to stop someplace. It's like a witch hunt now and the ones that are 
suffering are the children." 
</P>
<P>
The county foster parent group represents about 20 local foster parent 
associations, which act as support groups for foster parents and meet with 
county officials. Durand is vice president of one of the local groups, the San 
Fernando Valley Foster Parent Assn. Her effort is being supported by Ross and 
other foster parent presidents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we want the media, the state or the county to cover up abuse in 
foster care," Ross said. "But if children have been there for five, six, seven 
years and then they just come and pull them, I think that's wrong, too." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Children's Services Department was rocked by disclosures 
that county officials failed to strip the licenses of two foster parent group 
presidents -- including the head of the countywide association -- even after 
department investigators concluded that children had been physically and 
sexually abused in their homes. Durand, Ross and other foster parent leaders 
contend that the county is overreacting in the wake of those news accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, however, said the county is simply following a stricter standard than 
it has in the past. While acknowledging that removing children without any 
notice is often traumatic, he said, "We have to weigh that possibility against 
the equally real possibility of somebody being seriously hurt or molested." 
</P>
<P>
In the Durand case, according to her lawyer, John M. Blackburn, Durand's 
husband faced a complaint from a foster child three years ago that he had 
sexually molested her. The complaint was investigated by the Children's 
Services Department and police, Blackburn said, adding that authorities 
determined it was unfounded. The Durands were permitted to keep their foster 
home license. 
</P>
<P>
Harper would not discuss the Durand case, and state officials said Thursday 
that the couple has not been presented with a formal accusation -- the first 
step toward revocation of a foster parent's license. 
</P>
<P>
But Blackburn said he believes the county intends to revoke the Durands' 
license based on a new interview with the alleged victim, who no longer lives 
in the Durand home. The couple currently is caring for four foster children, 4 
through 13, all of whom are considered difficult to place because of emotional 
or medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
Both Blackburn and Avon Dawdy, president of the San Fernando Valley Foster 
Parent Assn., said that if Durand wins the temporary restraining order, they 
will use her case as a benchmark for other foster families who are once again 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like being tried twice for something," Dawdy said, "and it does not 
make any sense."

KEEPING KOSHER; 
</P>
<P>
RULES GET TOUGHER AFTER MAJOR STORE LOSES ITS CERTIFICATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rabbi Leo Erlich, a kosher meat inspector, doesn't often climb into trash 
dumpsters. But when he does, he can find the strangest things, like boxes from 
non-kosher meat companies. 
</P>
<P>
According to his account, that's what happened two months ago when he followed 
up a tip about fraudulent meat sales at Emes Kosher Meat Products on La Cienega 
Boulevard, the biggest kosher retailer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery led to the cancellation of Emes' kosher certificate and the 
closing of the store, whose name means truth in Hebrew. Orthodox rabbis say 
that plans were already in the works to raise standards of kosher enforcement 
before the Emes case attracted headlines, but that the effort gained momentum 
as a result of the publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the 47-member Rabbinical Council of California, the largest kosher 
inspection agency in the state, adopted a set of toughened rules governing the 
eligibility of butchers for kosher certification and providing for expanded 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the (Emes) scandal took us a long way. It was really an important 
stimulus," said council member Abner Weiss, chief rabbi of Congregation Beth 
Jacob in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still sick from that Emes business," said Erlich, 66, a short, wiry man 
who wears a straw hat as he makes his rounds of 15 kosher butcher shops on the 
Westside and in the San Fernando Valley on behalf of the Rabbinical Council. 
</P>
<P>
"People tell me, 'You're a hero. You caught him,' " said Erlich, speaking in a 
sharp Polish accent. "I say, 'I'm no hero.' It's a bad feeling when a Jewish 
person does it to other Jewish people." 
</P>
<P>
Semion Rachshtut, owner of the now-defunct Emes, has denied any wrongdoing, and 
there are no state charges pending against him or any other kosher butcher. 
</P>
<P>
The untrained eye may find it hard to tell the difference between kosher and 
tref, or non-kosher -- the real thing tastes saltier and looks duller -- but 
the difference is obvious in the price. 
</P>
<P>
The intricate routine of ritual slaughter, draining, salting and deveining can 
add a dollar or two a pound to the cost of meat or poultry, and the opportunity 
is there for the unscrupulous to make a quick buck. 
</P>
<P>
Erlich, who was trained at a yeshiva, or seminary, in Sosnowicz, Poland, said 
he tries to look in on each of his 15 shops at least once a day, but at 
variable hours. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the occasional disappointment of finding a dishonest merchant, Erlich, 
the Rabbinical Council's No. 1 inspector for butcher shops, said he gets a 
certain satisfaction from his job. 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure exactly how many of Los Angeles County's 600,000 Jews observe 
traditional dietary laws. But a survey released by the Jewish Federation 
Council of Greater Los Angeles said that 5% identify themselves as Orthodox, 
while 33% said they belong to the middle-of-the-road Conservative wing of 
Judaism. Both groups advocate adherence to the dietary laws. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to Rahamim's Kosher Meats on Pico Boulevard, Erlich 
walked carefully across the brick floor, slippery with water and blood, and 
stepped into the walk-in freezer, where he shrugged into the green sport coat 
he carries folded over his arm. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, he pointed to a quarter of beef hanging from a hook -- "Look here. It 
has a kosher seal on all four corners" -- and poked at a pile of chickens in a 
wooden box to make sure the ones on the bottom did not come from a non-kosher 
source such as a supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
"Business is very, very good, especially since they closed Emes," said owner 
Yoram Cohen. "I've got three or four times the business I had before." 
</P>
<P>
At Century City Meats, another shop nearby, Erlich watched as butcher Ezra 
Gamzu wielded a curved blade to trim the fat that hides three forbidden veins 
that must be removed before meat can be sold as kosher. The meat must also be 
soaked in water for an hour and a half, covered with salt for an hour and 
rinsed three times to remove as much blood as possible. 
</P>
<P>
A small number of butcher shops and bakeries and about 40 kosher restaurants in 
Los Angeles County get their certification from smaller, independent rabbinical 
groups rather than from the Rabbinical Council. 
</P>
<P>
Other eyes are watching, too, and not necessarily Jewish ones. Under a state 
law enacted in 1985, county inspectors routinely check delivery invoices at 
kosher butcher shops to make sure shoppers get what they pay for. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of anything else would amount to false advertising, said Paul Branum, 
an official of the state Department of Food and Agriculture, which administers 
the $70,000 kosher inspection program in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Santa 
Clara, San Francisco and Alameda counties. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Rabbinical Council and its competitors, government inspectors are 
not concerned with the rituals and ancient rabbinical rulings that govern the 
preparation of kosher food. Instead, they check the records that butchers keep 
to prove they bought their merchandise from kosher producers or packing houses. 
</P>
<P>
Those who cannot account for their merchandise may be fined or closed, said 
senior Assistant Atty. Gen. Herschel Elkins, who works with Nahan Gluck, head 
of the county Department of Weights and Measures, to enforce the law in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Erlich credits a county inspector with tipping him to possible violations at 
Emes, whose wide variety and low prices attracted customers from as far away as 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the work of kosher inspectors, Jews who care about their religion's 
dietary laws still have to trust their butcher, said Rabbi Joshua Berkowitz, 
newly named chairman of the kashrut (the noun form of kosher) committee of the 
Rabbinical Council of California. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to go into effect over the coming year, the new rules will require 
shop owners to be strict observers of the Sabbath. Those who are not observant 
Jews will be required to have a full-time inspector on their staff in order to 
keep their kosher certificate. 
</P>
<P>
Out-of-state wholesalers whose kosher standards are questionable will be 
banned, said Berkowitz, associate rabbi at Beth Jacob in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. was somewhat behind other communities, and I think it has come finally to 
the recognition that L.A. is the second-largest (Jewish) community in the U.S., 
and we don't have to act . . . like a backwater," Berkowitz said.

STATE CLAIMS END IS NEAR IN MEDFLY BATTLE; 
</P>

ERADICATION: AGRICULTURE CHIEF IS CONFIDENT THE WORST IS OVER, BUT AT LEAST ONE

<P>
On the eve of the most critical breeding period for the Mediterranean fruit 
fly, top agricultural officials declared Thursday that the worst of the 
yearlong infestation is over and complete victory may come by the end of next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"We're closing in and wringing the last drops out of the sponge. If we don't 
find any more flies, we're out of this in September," Henry J. Voss, director 
of the state Department of Food and Agriculture, said in a confident assessment 
of the eradication campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Voss presented his rosy prediction of impending victory at the monthly meeting 
of the 15-member state Board of Food and Agriculture, an advisory body to the 
governor on agricultural issues. 
</P>
<P>
He said the lack of recent fly finds, and the quickly shrinking size of the 
infestation, have prompted state officials to believe they have finally gained 
the upper hand over the pest, which poses a major threat to the state's 
lucrative agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
Voss' chief commander in the eradication effort, Assistant Director Isi 
Siddiqui, added that, despite continuing criticism about the effectiveness of 
the state's campaign of aerial malathion spraying and sterile fly releases, the 
relatively small number of Medfly finds in the last few weeks confirms that the 
strategy has been successful. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst of the infestation is over," Siddiqui said. "We are optimistic that 
this infestation is on the way out. . . . What we have proved is that what we 
are doing is working." 
</P>
<P>
The optimistic assessments of the Medfly war come just as the pest enters what 
has historically been its active breeding season. 
</P>
<P>
James R. Carey, a UC Davis entomologist and a member of the state's Medfly 
Science Advisory Panel, said that since the first Medfly was found in 
California in 1975, about two-thirds of the pests have been trapped in August, 
September and October. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's way, way too early to be optimistic," said Carey, who spoke 
before the board Thursday to propose putting the eradication campaign on a 
permanent basis. "There is a natural seasonality to the Medfly. I'm not 
optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
The state also has had a dubious track record in predicting the flow of battle 
against the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Voss issued a similar prediction of victory only to face a 
startling resurgence of the pest in March and April. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as late June, when Southern California went for nearly two months 
without a single Medfly find, Siddiqui and other agricultural officials were 
expressing similar optimism. However, that confidence was jolted by the 
discovery of a handful of Medflies that required a new round of malathion 
spraying around Rosemead, downtown Los Angeles and Glassell Park. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, Siddiqui said, there are persuasive arguments to suggest that 
the end is really near. 
</P>
<P>
No Medflies have been found in the last three weeks and only five in the last 
five weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
More important, he pointed out, no larvae, an immature form of the pest that 
lives in the ripe fruit, have been found since January. The lack of larval 
finds indicates that the Medfly may be close to disappearing from the region. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said the state is also now far better prepared to battle the Medfly 
than at almost any point during the infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the eradication campaign, there have been acute 
shortages of sterile Medflies, which have forced the state to embark on aerial 
spraying campaigns. But as the size of the infestation has begun shrinking, the 
supply of sterile flies will eventually be more than enough to combat new 
outbreaks without repeated malathion sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
About 305 square miles are now being treated with sterile flies. By the end of 
the month, the sterile-treatment zone will shrink to just 45 square miles, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No areas are now being sprayed with malathion, a factor that Voss said also has 
helped to lift the tense, crisis atmosphere that has pervaded much of the 
eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
Voss cautioned that he expects to find a few more flies in the coming months. 
But he said the latest trapping information seems to indicate that the days of 
big discoveries that sent the spray zone skyrocketing to 536 square miles this 
spring are history.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEATH PENALTY TO BE SOUGHT IN ACTRESS' 
MURDER

<P>
Prosecutors said Thursday they will seek the death penalty for an obsessed fan 
accused of murdering actress Rebecca Schaeffer -- unless the defense can give 
them a good reason not to. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark said documentation of Robert Bardo's reported 
history of mental illness might persuade them to seek a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Bardo, 20, of Tucson, allegedly stalked Schaeffer before shooting her at the 
door of her Fairfax district apartment last July. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Stephen Galindo said his client is receiving medication 
and may plead not guilty by reason of insanity. A psychiatric examination of 
Bardo was ordered by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Connor.

BILL BOYARSKY: BUCKING THE TREND ON CLEAN AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Ray Remy was Los Angeles deputy mayor, he liked to smother controversy by 
using a bureaucratic device called "reaching a consensus." 
</P>
<P>
He'd announce that the Administration had made a unanimous decision. The truth 
was, City Hall might have been torn apart with dissension. But dissidents in 
the bureaucracy, worried about job security, knew enough to keep their mouths 
shut. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, however, Remy's been out of the consensus business. As president of 
the Greater Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, he's fighting the strict clean air 
rules proposed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. He says the 
rules are anti-business. 
</P>
<P>
The transformation of Remy from super bureaucrat to tenacious lobbyist -- and 
his employment by the chamber -- reveal something about the changing nature of 
power in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Remy was more than City Hall's dictator of consensus. He was also the master of 
the technical end of government, working in perfect harmony with technocrat 
Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The two loved to talk about the details of sewage disposal, street construction 
and power generation. They'd been doing it for years. Remy worked for the 
League of California Cities when Bradley first met him. Later, Remy headed the 
Southern California Assn. of Governments before going to work for Bradley in 
1976. Meetings of both organizations are seminars in the heavy details of 
planning, sewage disposal, road building, police deployment and all the other 
municipal tasks. 
</P>
<P>
Remy was friends with like-minded bureaucrats from around the area. He knew his 
way around Sacramento and Washington, was on a first-name basis with powerful 
lawmakers and important staff members. And he knew the insides of every City 
Hall from Long Beach to West Covina. All that made him just the man for the 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1888, the chamber has gone through periods of furious 
activity followed by sleepy ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Created to pull the city out of a business bust, the chamber manufactured the 
early Los Angeles image of sunshine and health. One chamber advertising 
campaign featured a "California On Wheels" train, carrying fruits, vegetables, 
nuts and pitchmen. It toured the country, luring families to the Southland. In 
another promotion, the chamber built a 1,200-pound elephant, "Jumbo," out of 
walnuts. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber had more to offer than advertising. It was a political force in 
building the harbor and bringing in water from the Owens Valley. Decisions were 
made by a few powerful chamber cronies who settled things over lunch at the 
California Club in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But by mid-century, the city of Los Angeles was just one part of an economic 
network that spread from the harbor and the airport through the Inland Empire, 
and from Ventura through Orange County. Decisions at places like the Lockheed 
plant in Burbank were more important than those made in the California Club. 
</P>
<P>
So Remy and board supporters remade the chamber to fit the new political 
realities. The board became more diverse, becoming 20% minority. 
</P>
<P>
Remy also recognized that the fight against clean air proposals was more 
complicated than anything faced by his early-day chamber predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
All they had to do was fix matters at City Hall or bully a few key members of 
Congress into voting for a harbor appropriation. But the chamber couldn't push 
the AQMD board around. That's because it's not elected. Members are appointed 
by cities, counties, the governor and legislative leaders and serve five-year 
terms, designed to make them immune from political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
So Remy's hoping to benefit from all those trips to Washington and Sacramento, 
all those journeys on the small-city banquet circuit. He's got to find members 
of Congress and legislators who'll write laws weakening the district's 
regulatory power. He needs small-city officials to help persuade members of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
That's not easy in Southern California, where polls show people are willing to 
make sacrifices to clean up the air. It's tough in Washington, too, where Remy 
must confront the House's most influential clean air advocate, Rep. Henry 
Waxman of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Remy's a lot smoother than his predecessors, the harbor and aqueduct builders. 
He tries to avoid making waves. But in the end, Remy knowns this is no time for 
consensus.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY'S LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXCEED 
$750,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cost of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's legal defense in a series of 
conflict-of-interest probes has surpassed $750,000, according to a report 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The report on fund-raising activity by a committee set up to pay for the 
mayor's defense showed that Bradley owes about $310,000 to lawyers from three 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 1990, Bradley took in $140,000 toward his defense. 
He has raised a total of $560,000 since the scandal surrounding his 
Administration erupted last year. This year, most expenses have gone to 
attorneys representing Bradley in an ongoing federal probe of the mayor, 
including possible insider trading violations.

ELDERLY COUPLE FLEECED OF $11,000 FOR FAKE LOTTO TICKET; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ELABORATE SCAM CENTERS ON A WOMAN'S STORY THAT SHE WON THE LOTTERY BUT 
COULD NOT CLAIM PRIZE.

Every week for the last few years 72-year-old Edward J. Tafoya put down $10 -- 
sometimes $20 if the pot was big -- to play the California Lotto. He never won 
more than a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
So on Tuesday, when a woman claiming to be an illegal resident approached him 
in Bellflower and offered to sell him her winning ticket, he said, "I thought I 
could make a little money." 
</P>
<P>
Five hours later, after an elaborate scheme unfolded, Tafoya and his wife, 
Julia, 75, were out $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
The "winning" tickets they got, sealed in an envelope and placed in Julia 
Tafoya's pocket, were two worthless pieces of paper -- Lotto receipts of the 
winning numbers clearly marked "Not for Sale." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said Thursday that the Tafoyas were victims of an unusual, 
well-planned con that robbed the Paramount couple of most of their retirement 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a dummy," Edward Tafoya said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Lew Ritter, security director for Lotto, said, "If someone makes you an offer 
like this, and it looks too good to be true, it probably is." 
</P>
<P>
The Tafoyas said that about noon Tuesday the woman approached them at a 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'Do you know how to speak Spanish?' and I said, 'poquito' (a little 
bit), and that's how this all started," Tafoya recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, dressed neatly in a black skirt, embroidered white blouse and black 
pumps, told Tafoya she was ill and needed directions to an address in 
Bellflower where she could get help. Neither Tafoya nor his wife had heard of 
the place, so the woman hailed a passer-by who said he knew exactly where to 
go, Tafoya recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who called himself Roberto and appeared to be a stranger to the woman, 
suggested that the Tafoyas drive him and the woman to the place. By this time, 
Julia Tafoya said, the woman was groaning and clutching her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, what an actress," Julia Tafoya said in retrospect. "I felt so sorry for 
her. I was even holding her up by her arm. 
</P>
<P>
"She finally said, 'You are being so nice, I am going to tell you a deep 
secret,' " Julia Tafoya said. "So she said, 'Get close to me, I don't want 
anybody to hear.' " 
</P>
<P>
The woman told the Tafoyas she had a winning Lotto ticket that she could not 
claim because she was not a legal resident, they said. She said she would sell 
the ticket for $25,000, but Roberto said he wanted the ticket verified first. 
</P>
<P>
All four went to a pay phone, where the man dialed a number and let Julia 
Tafoya speak to a Spanish-speaking man at the other end. The man, who said he 
was a Lotto employee, verified the winning numbers, and said the ticket was 
worth close to $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto went to his bank and withdrew $14,000 for his cut of the deal, and the 
Tafoyas, with the others in tow, then went home for their checkbook and 
withdrew $11,000. They turned the money over to the woman. 
</P>
<P>
They then stopped at a drugstore, where Julia Tafoya went inside to buy 
medicine for the woman, who said she thought she was hemorrhaging. Somehow, the 
couple disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my wife, 'We got taken,' " Edward Tafoya said. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery spokeswoman Joanne McNabb said she believes this was the first time 
such a scam has taken place, and stressed that anyone -- legal resident or not 
-- can claim the lottery prize with a winning ticket.

PROBE FINDS NO BID-RIGGING BY CRA DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An investigation into the alleged mishandling of two public relations contracts 
by Community Redevelopment Agency Executive Director John Tuite has turned up 
no evidence that he rigged bids or falsified documents, officials announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the probe by the CRA Board of Commissioners determined that Tuite used 
authority he had been given in ways the board had not intended, and it ordered 
a review of agency practices involving contracts for less than $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley requested the investigation last month after allegations 
surfaced that a public relations firm had been hired by the CRA without 
competitive bidding, that Tuite used public funds to pay a consultant to 
promote his image, and that agency documents were falsely backdated. 
</P>
<P>
Tuite, who has held the $136,000-a-year job since 1986, denied wrongdoing at 
the time, and, in a statement issued Thursday, said he felt vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
"I've maintained from the start that the allegations were bogus," Tuite said. 
"After an extensive review, the CRA Board of Commissioners unanimously arrived 
at the same conclusion in dismissing all the claims as groundless." 
</P>
<P>
After three closed-door meetings over the last two weeks, the board said it 
determined that Tuite did not hire publicists Jane Duff and the Lippin Group 
for "self-promotion," that there was no evidence that bids were deliberately 
rigged to select a particular bidder and that there was no evidence that 
documents were backdated to falsify contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a written statement, the board said that, although it had delegated 
broad powers to Tuite in the handling of contracts for less than $25,000, there 
appeared to be "substantial difference" between written policies and actual 
agency practices.

TWO MEN BELIEVED RESPONSIBLE FOR 28 HOLDUPS OF FAST-FOOD RESTAURANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are looking for two men believed responsible for 28 robberies at 
Southland fast-food restaurants over the last four months, including three in 
one night this week in north Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the holdups have taken place in the adjoining Orange County cities of 
Buena Park and Cypress, with most of the remainder in such southeast Los 
Angeles County cities as La Mirada, Downey, Santa Fe Springs, Norwalk and 
Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
Although no injuries have been reported in any of the holdups, the gunmen have 
fired their weapons into the ground on two occasions, said Buena Park Police 
Sgt. Terry Branum. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are armed and dangerous," Branum said. "Somebody could get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The three latest robberies took place within 20 minutes of one another 
Wednesday night at a Jack-in-the-Box restaurant in Buena Park and two Del Taco 
restaurants in neighboring Cypress. Several hundred dollars were taken each 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Following their pattern in previous robberies, Branum said, the gunmen entered 
the establishments between 8 and 9 p.m. while only a few customers and 
employees were present and ordered everyone to the floor. Then they jumped 
behind the counter and emptied the safes and cash registers, he said.

LUNGREN AND SMITH TRADE SHOTS OVER FUND-RAISING

<TEXT>
<P>
Republican state attorney general candidate Dan Lungren on Thursday attacked 
his Democratic foe, Arlo Smith, for "violating the spirit" of campaign finance 
laws by accepting $362,000 in campaign loans, mostly from his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, at a Sacramento press conference, called on Smith to retire the loan 
before the November election so that it is clear to voters whom Smith will 
receive the funds from to repay the debt. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that Arlo is waiting until the November election to retire this 
massive debt -- when he can freely solicit funds from the special interests," 
said Lungren. "This may be technically legal, but it is unethical nonetheless." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Dist. Atty. Smith later called Lungren's statements "wild, 
reckless and irresponsible" and said that he intends, if possible, to retire 
the debt before the election. Already, Smith said, approximately $90,000 in 
additional loans from him and his wife, Helen Hale Smith, have been repaid by 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a desperate guy," Smith said. "We've basically out-raised him and he 
didn't have a contested primary." 
</P>
<P>
State campaign finance records made public this week showed that Lungren raised 
$433,186 during the first six months of the year, and had $216,965 cash on hand 
as of June 30. Smith, who waged a successful uphill primary battle against Los 
Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, raised $804,236, and had $181,825 cash 
on hand as of June 30. About half of Smith's funds came from loans made by him 
and his wife -- $355,356 of which remains outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Lungren, noting that the loans are not listed on 
Smith's campaign forms as community property, asked the Democrat "to come clean 
. . . (and) let us know the source of your (loan) funds." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said later that funds came from loans he and his wife have taken on their 
house. When they bought the St. Francis Woods residence in the mid-1950s, Smith 
said, it cost $50,000, but it is now worth between $750,000 and $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The house is paid off," said Smith. "We just happen to be an old-fashioned 
couple. . . . Everything we own is community property."

A rising Chinese ballet star, who disappeared last month while performing with 
the Houston Ballet Company, said he has asked for asylum in the United States. 
At a press conference in Washington, Lin Zhen said he dropped out of sight 
because his plan had been uncovered and dance officials threatened to return 
him to China. He said that a lack of freedom since Beijing's pro-democracy 
crackdown last year has made it impossible for him to continue his career 
there.

Rebels turned their backs on President Samuel K. Doe's troops and prepared to 
fight each other, a source close to guerrilla leader Prince Johnson said. 
Diplomats said the rivalry between Johnson and his foe, Charles Taylor, could 
prolong this West African nation's 7-month-old civil war for weeks. Johnson's 
fighters withdrew from key positions they have occupied in central Monrovia, 
leaving the capital open to renewed occupation by Doe's soldiers.

JUDGE APPROVES LOGGING PLANS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge ruled that logging plans already approved by the Department of Forestry 
are safe from the state's new spotted owl protection rules. Superior Court 
Judge James Luther made the ruling in lifting a temporary order barring 
Louisiana-Pacific Corp. from logging five acres of old-growth trees in the 
Navarro Ridge area near Mendocino. 
</P>
<P>
Luther said the new rules approved last month after the spotted owl was 
declared a threatened species are "inapplicable to this plan or any other plan 
approved prior to (the board's) decision." The judge said the state does not 
need to reassess logging plans already approved for their possible impact on 
spotted owls, but cutting can be limited if owl nesting sites are spotted. 
State forestry officials argued that applying the new owl rules retroactively 
could mean suspending 3,000 timber harvest plans covering 14 million acres of 
private timberland.

at Quartzsite, Ariz., just east of the Colorado River. Whitehouse attributed 
the illness to fatigue from preflight preparations.

FBI INVESTIGATES OFFICER'S USE OF STUN GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an action routinely taken in cases of alleged police brutality, the FBI has 
opened a civil rights investigation into the repeated use of a stun gun by a 
Ventura police officer on an epileptic motorist. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Auer, the FBI's regional supervisor in Ventura, said his agents are 
examining Officer Steven Mosconi's use of the Nova Spirit stun gun on Donn 
Christensen Jr. on June 23 after Christensen had caused a minor traffic 
accident during an epileptic seizure. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of that investigation and the interviews will be provided to the 
Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., and the United States attorney in 
Los Angeles for their review," Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department and federal prosecutor's office then will decide whether 
there is any basis to file charges accusing Mosconi of violating civil rights 
laws, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI investigation, a common move in cases where state or local law 
enforcement officials are accused of brutality, was revealed just eight days 
after the Ventura County district attorney's office said it would not pursue 
criminal charges against Mosconi. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office ruled that Mosconi had committed "no provable 
violation of criminal law," and Ventura police officials agreed. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ventura Police Chief Richard F. Thomas said his department would take 
appropriate action against Mosconi for violating department policy in the stun 
gun incident. 
</P>
<P>
But Thomas has routinely refused to comment on the case. And by Thursday, more 
than five weeks after the incident, police still had not reached a decision on 
what action to take against Mosconi. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials have said that violating department policy can carry a penalty 
ranging from an oral reprimand to firing. 
</P>
<P>
Auer would not discuss what prompted the FBI's investigation. But another FBI 
source noted that civil rights investigations are frequently opened when the 
Justice Department learns of alleged incidents of police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is one of at least two the FBI has opened in Ventura County 
in recent weeks. The FBI also is investigating charges by four Oxnard men that 
they were beaten by Oxnard police who answered complaints about a loud party on 
June 15. 
</P>
<P>
When asked how often such investigations have led to criminal charges in 
Southern California, FBI spokesman Fred Reagan in Los Angeles said he could not 
recall such a prosecution since 1984, when a California Highway Patrolman was 
convicted of civil rights violations in a murder case and sentenced to 90 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
But Christensen, who has filed a $2-million civil claim against Mosconi and the 
city of Ventura, applauded the FBI's entry into the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, the FBI -- whenever there's a civil rights allegation against a 
public official -- is obliged to investigate, which is gratifying," Christensen 
said Thursday. "I feel I didn't have any action from the local D.A." 
</P>
<P>
Christensen said he believes that the FBI will be "a lot more impartial than 
the local officials." 
</P>
<P>
Christensen suffered an epileptic seizure behind the wheel of his 1984 Ford 
Ranger pickup truck, causing a traffic accident on Thompson Boulevard just 
after 6 p.m. on June 23. Mosconi arrived on his motorcycle and was told by 
paramedics that Christensen was recovering from the seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing that Christensen's eyes were red and glassy, Mosconi demanded the keys 
from him. When Christensen refused several times to comply, Mosconi drew his 
stun gun and again demanded the keys from Christensen, shocking him each time 
he refused, according to the police report. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving six to eight shocks, Christensen finally got out and stood 
passively by the truck, where Mosconi shocked him at least twice more, 
according to the district attorney's office and witnesses at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen's damage claim alleged that the shocks have caused him to suffer 
nightmares, sleeplessness and anxiety and that they may cause him to suffer 
post-traumatic stress disorders in the future.

PROSECUTORS MAY READ BRODERICK'S DIARIES, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors are entitled to pore through secret diaries kept by murder suspect 
Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick, a San Diego Superior Court judge ruled 
Thursday. He said they might prove to be evidence, the same way a gun could. 
</P>
<P>
Although the diaries might contain immense amounts of irrelevant material, that 
was not enough of a reason, as Broderick's defense lawyer claimed, to keep them 
from prosecutors, Judge Thomas Whelan said. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan said prosecutors have the right to search for statements they might find 
useful, the same way that police are authorized to search the scene of a 
killing for bullets or shell casings. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was one of several decisions Whelan issued at a pretrial hearing on 
technical defense attempts to keep various items from being used as evidence at 
Broderick's upcoming trial. Those efforts failed, but there was no indication 
from Whelan or the lawyers in the case that any single piece of evidence -- 
including any of the diaries -- was by itself critical. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 42, is accused of murdering her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick, 44, 
a prominent medical malpractice lawyer, and his new wife, Linda Kolkena 
Broderick, last Nov. 5. She has pleaded innocent and is being held without bail 
at the County Jail in Las Colinas. 
</P>
<P>
Her trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel and Betty Broderick divorced in 1986, after 16 years of marriage. During 
and after the bitter divorce, Betty accused Daniel of using his legal influence 
to cheat her out of her fair share of his seven-figure income. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick confessed to the slayings in a March interview with The Times, 
calling the killings a "desperate act of self-defense" against a man who wanted 
to control her. She attended the hearing on Thursday before Whelan. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of the diaries was disclosed only recently by prosecutors, who 
contended in legal papers that defense attorney Jack Earley had known about 
them -- and been able to read them -- for months but declined to share them. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick began writing the diaries around February, 1985, when she and Daniel 
separated, Earley said Thursday, adding that the diaries -- 10 volumes in all 
-- end in mid-1988. 
</P>
<P>
According to Earley, two or three volumes consist of longhand drafts of 
Broderick's book-length manuscript of her marriage, "What's a Nice Girl to Do? 
A Story of White Collar Domestic Violence in America." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells told Whelan last month that Earley had an 
obligation to turn over the diaries to the prosecution, contending that they 
might offer clues to Betty Broderick's emotional state. After that claim was 
made, Earley submitted the diaries to Whelan for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
Earley said Thursday that he had no problem with turning over relevant 
passages, if there were any. But he objected to sharing all 10 volumes, saying 
there might be material that Broderick intended to share only with her lawyers 
during the divorce or might simply be embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
"She is still presumed to be innocent, still a private citizen and still has a 
right to privacy to things that she owns," Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan, however, said that it was up to prosecutors, not the defense, to decide 
what might be relevant to the prosecution of the case, and ordered the 
disclosure of all 10 volumes. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as a gun would be evidence of how a homicide was committed, these diaries 
could be evidence of why," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan said, though, that he is concerned about the release of material 
Broderick intended only for her lawyers, because that should stay secret. To 
preserve any confidences, Whelan said, he will review the diaries before he 
turns them over to prosecutors at the next hearing in the case, scheduled Aug. 
16.

MARINE D.I.S GIVE AN EARFUL TO SOVIET BRASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marine Corps drill instructor Dave Brown faced the high-ranking Soviet navy 
officers and screamed at the top of his lungs: "Keep your mouths closed!" 
</P>
<P>
Startled, Soviet Commander of the Pacific Fleet Adm. Genadiy Alexandrovich 
Khvatov looked at Staff Sgt. Brown and raised his bushy eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep your head and eyeballs straight!" barked Brown, who teaches people how to 
stand at attention -- one way or another. "Hurry up. Hurry up. Get out of the 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Marine Corps boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen visiting Soviet navy officials and their U.S. counterparts endured 
the first two minutes of boot camp at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Thursday 
with good grace as Brown and other D.I.s screamed at them to put their feet on 
the yellow footprints that forced them to line up in platoon-like fashion. It 
didn't cause an international incident. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officers explained to the Soviets that fierce yelling is the standard 
introduction to boot camp and is the best way to prove that the civilian world 
disappeared when the recruits passed through the depot's gates. But, from the 
looks on the dignitaries' faces, clearly there is no way to prepare anyone for 
his first face-to-face encounter with a Marine D.I. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if anything in the two days of picnics, sightseeing, and tours of naval 
facilities had surprised him, Rear Adm. Igor N. Khmel'nov replied: "The two 
minute stand-at-attention drill." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet officers are among the 850 who sailed here aboard three Soviet navy 
ships Tuesday in the first such visit to the West Coast in 127 years. It 
represents the second round of a navy-to-navy exchange program that began last 
year when Soviet ships made a port call at Norfolk, Va., and the U.S. Navy 
sailed to the Black Sea port of Sevastopol. Next month, U.S. warships will sail 
to Vladivostok. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Soviets will depart San Diego, where Soviet vessels have 
traditionally been prohibited from visiting because it is considered a hub of 
U.S. Navy activity. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unheard of, Soviet warships in San Diego," said Col. Regan R. Wright, 
chief of staff at the Recruit Depot next to Lindbergh Field. "Two years ago, it 
would have been World War III if they tried to pull in." 
</P>
<P>
The port call, meant to further goodwill and friendship between the two 
nations, has been hailed by both Soviets and Americans as a success. 
</P>
<P>
"The visit has exceeded our expectations," said Adm. Charles Larson, 
commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. "We probably won't agree on 
everything, but it's important that we understand each other and find a common 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
Larson accompanied Khvatov and a slew of navy brass from both countries over 
the dusty Marine training ground Thursday morning. On the obstacle course, 
several hundred camouflage-clad recruits ran, climbed up ropes, scrambled down 
wires, rappelled off walls, tumbled into ditches, vaulted hurdles, leaped over 
poles, and sweated. 
</P>
<P>
Khvatov at one point waved over 18-year-old Pvt. Frederick Johnson, an 
18-year-old recruit from St. Petersburg, Fla. Through an interpreter, Khvatov 
asked what brought the young man here. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to serve my country, sir," Johnson hastily replied. 
</P>
<P>
Khvatov wished Johnson good luck, then walked to a platform holding barbells. 
He flexed his muscles and picked up a 25-pound set. 
</P>
<P>
The party then moved to a jousting exercise dubbed "Bridge over Troubled 
Water," where two recruits on a narrow footbridge were pummeling one another 
with pugil sticks. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are you dancing up there?" one drill instructor screamed as the men 
whacked at each other with the padded sticks. As one man tumbled from the 
bridge into the water, Khvatov questioned Sgt. Rodney Mitchell about the 
exercise. Mitchell explained that it helped teach the basics of fighting with 
bayonets. 
</P>
<P>
When Khvatov walked off, Mitchell -- a man whose biceps are larger than 
cantaloupes -- was clearly awed. "I didn't think I would ever have a chance to 
talk to a Soviet admiral like that," said Mitchell, a 28-year-old Birmingham, 
Ala. native. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the Soviet officers, the visit was more than just watching and getting 
yelled at by drill instructors. They were also required to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. John S. Grinalds, commander of the Marine Corps' western recruiting 
region, taught the Soviet guests to slap the high-five salute and to bellow the 
guttural Marine cry: "Ooh-rah." 
</P>
<P>
The trademark "Ooh-rah" sound is "the only way recruits can express emotion," 
explained Grinalds, who led the guests in three choruses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been more than 100 years since the Soviet navy visited San Diego -- that 
is too long," said Grinalds. "You must come back sooner."

10 ARRESTED AT AIRPORT JANITORS' SIT-IN; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: A GROUP OF FIRED JANITORS AND UNION OFFICIALS STAGE A PROTEST AT 
LINDBERGH FIELD OVER THE FIRING OF 55 EMPLOYEES BY A MAINTENANCE COMPANY THAT 
THEY SAY IS ANTI-UNION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ten people, including union officials, were arrested Thursday at Lindbergh 
Field during a protest over the firings of 55 union janitors by a new 
maintenance company hired to clean the airport. 
</P>
<P>
A Harbor Police spokesman said the 10 were cited for trespassing and released 
on a promise to appear later in court. Police said the protest was peaceful and 
reported no serious incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Eliseo Medina, president of the Service Employees International Union, Local 
102, was among those arrested at the sit-in. Medina and other Local 102 
officials organized the protest to bring attention to the firings by World 
Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials were awarded a janitorial contract for Lindbergh Field in May 
by the Board of Port Commissioners. World began servicing the airport July 1 
and fired 55 of 70 union janitors. 
</P>
<P>
The workers, who had struggled for years to win union representation, were 
replaced with non-union employees. Some of the fired employees had worked at 
the airport for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The company has refused to negotiate with Local 102, which organized the 
janitors in 1987, Medina said. Between 1979 and 1987, the janitors had their 
wages frozen at $5.30 an hour. The workers were earning $5.66 an hour when 
World was awarded the contract, said Medina. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the union complained to the Port District about what it said was 
World's record as an "anti-worker and anti-union" employer. The union recited a 
litany of complaints about the company's alleged unfair employment practices in 
San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite doing business in California for about seven years, a World official 
acknowledged at the same meeting that the company had failed to register with 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
Medina said the union has organized more sit-ins today and Saturday to pressure 
the Port District to intervene on behalf of the fired workers. 
</P>
<P>
However, late Thursday afternoon, Medina said the union was ordered to appear 
at 10:45 a.m. today in San Diego Superior Court, where Port District attorneys 
will seek an injunction to stop the planned protests. 
</P>
<P>
Port spokesman Dan Wilkens said he could not confirm the scheduled court 
hearing, but criticized Local 102 for staging Thursday's demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly a lamentable situation in every way. But we were forced (to 
call Harbor Police) because of the actions of the union, which sought to 
disrupt the normal flow of the public to the airlines," said Wilkens. "We 
didn't want to do this. We asked the union not to do the sit-in 
demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commissioners have been reviewing the company's operation and are 
expected to decide at Tuesday's meeting whether to cancel the Port District's 
contract with World. Company President Samuel L. Kim and Vice President Joseph 
Mrozewski were unavailable for comment. Chen Park Lee, the company's airport 
manager, was also unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
At least one commissioner has complained that the Port District acted too 
hastily in awarding a cleaning contract to World. Commissioner Lynn Schenk said 
last month that commissioners did not have enough background information about 
the company when they awarded it the contract.

Not exactly "Whistle While You Work," is it? 
</P>
<P>
Rock 'n' roll pioneer Bo Diddley highlighted a lunchtime outdoor concert at the 
Westin Bonaventure on Thursday with what he said would be a special number for 
all the women in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"This song," Diddley announced, "is called, 'Shut Up, Woman.' " 
</P>
<P>
Say what? The song's lyrics would hardly make the National Organization for 
Women's play list. But it did hold out a comeuppance: 
</P>
<P>
"Woman, why are you comin' so close to me?" Diddley shouted in the last stanza. 
"What you got in your hand? . . . a razor!" 
</P>
<P>
And thus inspired, everybody went back to the office. . . . 
</P>
<P>
To the frustrated Angeleno whose cry, "Can anybody read this?" was painted 
above a sprawl of graffiti, and appeared in a photo in This Space: the answer 
is yes. And no. 
</P>
<P>
Several callers said they had deciphered the markings as those of a Latino 
gang. There were two votes for La Vida Loca, one for Vivia Logos, one for La 
Via Logos, three for La Via Locos. One man suggested it was LA, and Via, like 
the preposition "through" -- hence, "Through L.A." A guided tour? The most 
inventive: Lavia Locos, followed by a word with RAT in it. Maybe, this 
Champollion of the streets suggested, it says "Lavia Locos Are Rats." 
</P>
<P>
Think of it as a composition for winds and surf, brine con brio. 
</P>
<P>
Five top high school musicians, here for the Malibu Strawberry Creek Musical 
Festival, tuned up in surf's up on the Santa Monica Pier. 
</P>
<P>
As a publicity stunt, it worked; you're reading this, aren't you? As a musical 
climate, there was less to recommend it. The musicians, all in beach gear, 
played valiantly through Gyorgi Ligeti's "Six Bagatelles," fretting about what 
sand could do to their instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Legend holds that when young Brian Wilson turned in an early version of 
"Surfin' USA" as an assignment in a high school music composition class, he got 
an F. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, it's been a long time since we've seen a lot of water in one place, 
but let's not get hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
Another newspaper's story about two large swimming pools at the AAF Rose Bowl 
Aquatics Center in Pasadena noted that the combined "water space" is "roughly 
the size of Lake Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
Not us, says center President Terry Wilson. "We have a lot of water, but 
nowhere near that size." Lake Michigan covers about 22,300 square miles; L.A. 
County, 4,070 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
If that was written tongue in cheek, nobody's got that much cheek. If it's 
true, we tell you this to give you time to get to higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
The local government section of the phone book lists an MIA hot line. We got 
very excited. 
</P>
<P>
Could we have stumbled onto a secret? Have those American military men who 
vanished sometime between the Tet Offensive and the 1975 Vietnam pullout been 
held downtown all this time, and subjected to the Geneva Convention-busting 
agony of listening to Board of Supervisors meetings? 
</P>
<P>
The MIA hot line is a health department number; MIA stands for Male Indigent 
Adult. Aware of the confusion, they do provide the number for the real MIA 
office, for men still missing in action.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEVELOPER'S SALES BARRED UNTIL TREES ARE 
REPLACED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developer of a West Hills housing tract has been barred from selling his 
luxury homes until he replaces three large oak trees that vanished from the 
construction site, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said she will also ask the city attorney's office to prosecute developer 
Ezra Raiten on misdemeanor charges of violating a city ordinance designed to 
preserve oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
As part of an agreement with the city, Raiten was to relocate the oaks to a 
nearby lot. But Raiten said the trees "died when we moved them," adding he 
would replace them.

<P>
A bank robber who writes demand notes on Manila envelopes struck his third bank 
in two weeks, the FBI said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The man robbed the World Savings and Loan Assn. at 2704 E. Thompson Blvd., 
Ventura, at 12:55 p.m. Wednesday, said Gary Auer, special agent in charge of 
the FBI's Ventura office. 
</P>
<P>
The man handed a teller a Manila envelope on which was scrawled a note 
demanding money and warning that he had a gun, Auer said. The robber escaped on 
foot with an undisclosed amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
The man is described as a white male, about 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighing 
160 pounds. He is about 25, has short blond hair and was wearing a white 
T-shirt and tan pants, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe the same man is responsible for robberies July 28 at First 
Nationwide Bank, 1055 S. Oxnard Blvd., Oxnard, and July 26 at Security Pacific 
National Bank, 9493 Telephone Road, Ventura, Auer said. CAROL WATSON

HOUSE OKS MONEY FOR 2 NAVAL BASES

<P>
Despite cutbacks in the military budget, the House of Representatives has 
included nearly $15 million for construction projects at the two Naval bases in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The House-passed package now will go to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The military construction package approved earlier this week allocated $10.1 
million for construction of a laboratory to integrate weapons at the Naval Ship 
Weapons Systems Engineering Station at Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
It also included slightly more than $2 million to improve an electrical 
distribution system at the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme 
and another $2 million to beef up security at the Pacific Missile Test Center 
at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hubbert, a spokesman at Point Mugu, said the base plans to build fences and 
upgrade alarms at secret operations at the missile test center. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the House included $513,000 to build a new office that doles out 
family housing on base. "Those guys are working in old post-World War II 
buildings. They need better space," Hubbert said. KENNETH R. WEISS

A TICKET IN REDONDO MAY BE ONE FOR THE RECORDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cruising the Redondo Beach Esplanade with an alert eye, Police Officer David 
Stauffer responds quickly as the driver of a silver BMW nonchalantly zooms 
straight ahead from a left-hand turn pocket and cuts off another car. 
</P>
<P>
Stauffer, completing his fifth week with the Redondo Beach Police Department, 
flips a quick U-turn in his squad car and follows the BMW, as his training 
supervisor, Officer Jim Toti, reaches for a red button on the dash. 
</P>
<P>
A video camera mounted in the roof near Toti's head quietly starts to record 
every moment in the brief pursuit. Within two blocks, the BMW pulls over, its 
driver clearly irritated. 
</P>
<P>
"What? What did I do?" he asks as the camera tapes Stauffer's cautious approach 
toward him. 
</P>
<P>
"May I see your driver's license and the car's registration?" Stauffer replies 
politely. As he writes out a citation, a microphone in his shirt pocket records 
every word of the conversation and broadcasts it to Toti. 
</P>
<P>
Though the traffic stop is a common event, its high-tech witness -- an 
experimental training tool for new officers -- is not so common. After three 
months in front of the camera, however, training officers say it should be. 
</P>
<P>
The $4,500-dollar video camera's unblinking eye has caught small mistakes that 
might have gone unnoticed or that a supervisor might have forgotten to mention 
at the time, training officers say. 
</P>
<P>
The sound transmission also lets training officers stand back and listen in on 
a conversation without hovering too near a trainee, giving the new officers 
greater autonomy while their supervisors retain an ideal vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good learning tool," Toti said. "It's something I certainly didn't have 
when I started (as a field trainer), but I wish I had had it. It's a great 
visual aide, where I can show them, 'Now, this is what you did, and I don't 
want you doing it again.' " 
</P>
<P>
Having both a camera and a supervisor track their every move was a daunting 
prospect at first, but trainees say they quickly became accustomed to the 
camera and now welcome the guidance it provides. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw myself when I was searching a suspect, that I was opening myself up for 
a blow by his left arm," Stauffer said. "I think the (supervisor) saw it, too, 
but right then, at the time, they can't say anything because you're with a 
subject, and you have to concentrate on that." 
</P>
<P>
The video device, called a DocuCam, was created in 1987 by Tech Systems, an 
Atlanta-based company that specializes in security camera systems and cable 
television network designs. 
</P>
<P>
The camera hangs from the squad car's ceiling next to the rear-view mirror. An 
electrical cord connects it the taping device, which sits in a special cooling 
chamber in the trunk of the car. 
</P>
<P>
The DocuCam was first developed for the Georgia State Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"We work solo here, with only one trooper to a car, and the troopers were 
saying that they felt vulnerable," Georgia Cpl. Eddie Smith said. "We wanted a 
means of establishing a record of exactly what happens between a trooper and a 
violator." 
</P>
<P>
Using money returned under federal narcotics asset forfeiture laws, the patrol 
bought 27 cameras in the spring of 1987 and quickly gathered enough money to 
expand the number to 200. Ultimately, Smith said, the patrol would like to have 
a DocuCam in each of its 800 squad cars. 
</P>
<P>
In the Georgia units, the video camera automatically starts up every time a 
squad car's emergency lights are flipped on. The camera also can be operated 
manually for special shots, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can take it out of the car to film an entire search procedure, to take 
pictures at an accident scene, to do any number of things," Smith said. "The 
troopers love it. They say it's like an invisible eye there watching over them, 
protecting them from allegations of wrongdoing. . . . The public loves it as 
well, because it protects them from any abuse on the part of the trooper." 
</P>
<P>
Under regulations adopted when the system was first installed, troopers turn in 
the tapes from the cars at the end of each shift. The tapes are then kept for 
at least two years, or until any case relating to the tape has been completed. 
</P>
<P>
Delighted to have a front-seat vantage point, judges also have become fans of 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts the judge on the scene. . . . It can be used for the state or for the 
defense," said Walton County, Ga., Superior Court Judge Greg Adams. "I don't 
hesitate to admit it as evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The camera system has become quite popular among law enforcement agencies 
throughout the South, Tech Systems Vice President Darryl Keeler said. In recent 
weeks, the company also has been receiving orders from Nebraska, Arizona and 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach's single camera was the first installed in this state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While pleased by its performance as a field training tool, Redondo Beach 
administrators said they hesitate to put it to other uses at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there will be questions about using it in an evidentiary manner in 
court, but at this point it's just an experimental thing," said Lt. Ken 
Keating, who oversees field training. 
</P>
<P>
The department is pulling together some of the best footage shot so far to 
create a master training tape that can then be shown to department 
administrators considering other uses for the camera. 
</P>
<P>
"We've certainly seen more pluses than negatives with this," Keating said. 
"It's another useful tool for us, and we'll just have to wait and see what uses 
present themselves."

MUSCLE CAMP BULGES WITH RECRUITS;

FITNESS: FOR ABOUT $800, NEWCOMER BODY BUILDERS LIFT WEIGHTS AND ATTEND 
NUTRITION AND TRAINING SEMINARS DURING A WEEKLONG STAY.

Robert and Connie Hurwitz are no Mr. and Mrs. Olympia. After years of sporadic 
dieting, they had lost some weight. But they wanted to lose more, and their 
muscle tone left something to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
So when they read about the Muscle and Fitness Bodybuilding Camp, they signed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
As arrival day at the camp neared recently, the 45-year-old Hurwitz imagined 
being among muscle-bound campers who would scoff at his "pear-like body." 
</P>
<P>
"I expected to be the small, fat, little guy," Hurwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
But when he arrived, he realized that few of his fellow campers had the bulging 
muscles he had imagined. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel like the small, fat, little guy; I looked around and said, 'Hey, 
I did pretty good,' " Hurwitz said, sitting with his wife on a bench in a 
corner of the camp gym. 
</P>
<P>
For about $800, Hurwitz and his fellow muscle campers lift weights and attend 
nutrition and training seminars while living and eating for one week at Loyola 
Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
There are four sessions, and about 750 people -- from engineers to rodeo bull 
riders -- are expected to take part by the end of the summer, said Vince 
Scalici, an assistant director of the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the campers are people already interested in bodybuilding, who learned 
about the camp through Muscle and Fitness magazine, which is one of the 
sponsors. Instructors include former Mr. and Mrs. Olympias and a number of 
professional bodybuilders who have won the Mr. Universe and other bodybuilding 
competitions worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The Muscle and Fitness Bodybuilding Camp, operated by a private company that 
rents space from the university, began five years ago in New Jersey when 
directors Marc Missoreck and David Zelon, both bodybuilding professionals, saw 
a need for a comprehensive summer camp for bodybuilders similar to the 
basketball and football camps run by other professional athletes. 
</P>
<P>
They gathered professional bodybuilders to instruct campers with varying 
degrees of experience. Professional nutritionists teach proper dieting 
techniques that stress nutrition and exercise as the best means to lose weight. 
After the first year, the camp moved to Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
The gym, equipped with $500,000 worth of fitness equipment (including free 
weights, stationary bicycles, Nautilus machines and treadmills), looks like a 
bodybuilding supermarket. Areas are marked off -- chest, back, shoulders, legs, 
arms -- in the 12,000-square-foot facility for work on particular parts of the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
At the far side of the room, a "squat machine" is surrounded on three sides by 
aluminum bleachers. Berry De Mey, who placed third in the Mr. Olympia 
competition in 1988, stands by the machine and gives a lecture on its use to 
develop strong legs. 
</P>
<P>
As De Mey tightens his quadriceps in illustration, many of the 150 campers -- 
in tights or sweats or Gold's Gym tank tops -- flash cameras and focus video 
camcorders on him. "I have to show people what I did on my vacation," said one 
camper with a camera. 
</P>
<P>
When De Mey finishes posing, he demonstrates the proper way to do a squat and 
then calls for a volunteer from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Schetzen, a 35-year-old custom van dealer from New York, volunteers. 
"This is the one thing I came here for," he said, standing beside the squat 
machine with De Mey. Many of the campers, like Schetzen, said they had come to 
the camp with a particular goal in mind. 
</P>
<P>
After the lecture, the group walks across the campus for a lunch of brown rice, 
protein drinks, hard-boiled eggs, salad and steamed turkey burgers. 
</P>
<P>
For Henri Stetter, a Swiss business executive who lives in Hong Kong, the bland 
lunch is a welcome change. He complains of oily foods and lack of health 
consciousness in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
He says friends laughed at him when they learned that he planned to spend part 
of his vacation at a bodybuilding camp. But Stetter, the head of the sporting 
goods manufacturing division of his company, says the camp will help him learn 
more about the sporting goods industry in this country. The 34-year-old former 
member of the Swiss national basketball team also expects to improve his diet 
and weight-training skills for his daily hourlong workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with myself. I'm just doing this to keep in shape," Stetter said. "I 
have a son who is 8 years old, and my goal is that 10 years from now I'll be 
able to keep up with him." 
</P>
<P>
At an average age of 29, some of the campers had led lives as "couch potatoes," 
disregarding physical fitness, according to at least one camper, Lawrence 
Chabra, a graphic designer from New York. 
</P>
<P>
Scalici says many of the people at camp take vacation time to be there, and 
"two years ago a couple spent their honeymoon here." He said that attaining 
bigger muscles and the desire to look better are the primary reasons people 
come to the camp. 
</P>
<P>
"They come from all over, 50 states and 20 foreign countries, but they all want 
to look better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the majority of campers, looking better is tantamount to feeling better. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I can conquer anything when I walk out of the gym," said Gary 
Downing, a former Marine who owns a gym in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of men feel small," said Connie Hurwitz, one of 33 women at the 
camp. "Bodybuilding helps their egos and helps them feel more of a man. I don't 
know why, but I've heard it from several of them at our table. Each man had a 
certain part of his body that made him feel like he didn't look like a strong 
man." 
</P>
<P>
Bodybuilding is "a confidence thing," Scalici said. "Many people call up the 
camp apprehensive, saying, 'I don't really have much of a body. Can I still 
come?' "I admire those people when they come here. They have a bit more guts to 
stick their fat bellies out. The first day they don't know what to expect, but 
by the final night, if they're in a big T-shirt or a bikini, they'll all be 
posing on stage." 
</P>
<P>
Connie Hurwitz said bodybuilding has given her a better attitude toward her 
body, despite the fact that she is not as thin as she would like to be. "I can 
actually say that I see definition now. . . . I feel good about me. I guess I'm 
feeling good about me because I see results."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oceanside resident who has contracted malaria probably was infected locally 
by a mosquito bite, county health officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The person, who lives near San Luis Rey River, had not traveled outside San 
Diego County recently, leading county health officials to conclude that a 
mosquito was the probable source of his infection. 
</P>
<P>
Besides surveying the area for any other possible cases, county officials also 
set mosquito traps along the riverbed and also plan to spray the area through 
Saturday night to kill adult mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that only one of the 24 mosquito species known to occupy the county is 
capable of carrying malaria, health officials emphasized that the chances of 
getting the disease through a mosquito bite are slim. Nevertheless, people who 
live near the riverbed should take precautions such as wearing long-sleeved 
shirts and pants or using mosquito repellents, they added.

As a federal judge on Thursday began considering a new political map for Los 
Angeles County, Sarah Flores made a final appeal to the judge to preserve her 
campaign to become the first Latino on the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
A day after he rejected a redistricting plan drawn by the board's conservative 
majority, U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon listened to testimony from the 
architects of three maps submitted by the plantiffs in the voting rights case. 
Kenyon did not say when he would decide on a new plan. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he will hold his final hearing in the two-year-old case today, 
taking arguments on whether he should call off a November runoff between Flores 
and Gregory O'Brien and order a new primary election in a redrawn 1st district, 
as requested by plaintiffs in the voting rights case. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon on June 4 ruled that the supervisors intentionally discriminated against 
Latinos in drawing district boundaries in 1981. On Wednesday, he rejected a new 
map submitted by the supervisors as a "nonsensical distortion" of supervisorial 
districts that is "insensitive" to the voting rights of blacks and Latinos. The 
county is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's hearing, plaintiffs' experts Bernard Grofman, a UC Irvine 
political scientist, and Leobardo Estrada, a UCLA professor of urban planning, 
testified that the plaintiffs' three maps offer an equal opportunity for a 
Latino to win a seat on the powerful five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
The maps-which are similar-would carve out a predominantly Latino district 
bearing the designation of retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum's 1st district. 
The new 1st district would stretch from El Sereno and Lincoln Heights through 
downtown Los Angeles east to Irwindale and La Puente and southeast to Santa Fe 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The differences in the maps is how they affect the other four supervisors and 
the two candidates running to succeed Schabarum. The plans also would 
jeopardize the board's conservative majority while changing the political 
representation for many of the county's 8 1/2 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the U.S. Justice Department, a plaintiff, recommended that Kenyon 
approve a plan which includes the Glendora homes of Flores and O'Brien in the 
new 1st district. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, the top vote-getter in the June primary with 35% of the vote, made a 
final appeal to Kenyon in court to reject all three plaintiffs' maps and 
instead approve a plan proposed last year by the Justice Department, which 
would make Supervisor Ed Edelman's 3rd district the new Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
That, she told the judge, would create an opportunity for two Latinos to be 
elected to the board -- her and a Latino from Edelman's district. Under this 
plan, Edelman's Westwood home would be placed in Supervisor Deane Dana's 4th 
district and the new 3rd district would be without an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' attorney Thomas Bourke told the judge that making Schabarum's district 
the Latino district would force Flores into a "fratricidal battle with other 
Hispanics." Bourke complained that the plaintiffs' maps protect incumbent 
supervisors who "have been found by this court to be wrongdoers." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom Flores, a Republican backed by two of the board's 
conservatives, questioned "whether plaintiffs are promoting the agenda of 
Hispanics or the (liberal) politics of the ACLU."

BRADLEY'S DEFENSE COSTS SURPASS $750,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The cost of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's legal defense in a series of 
conflict-of-interest investigations has surpassed $750,000, according to a new 
report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The report on fund-raising activity by a committee set up to pay for the 
mayor's legal defense showed that Bradley still owes about $310,000 to a team 
of lawyers from three Los Angeles firms. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, Bradley took in $140,000 toward his legal 
defense. He has raised a total of $560,000 since the scandal surrounding his 
Administration erupted last year. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's spokesman, Bill Chandler, announced that another $150,000 is expected 
to be raised for the fund during a reception this month. He said the event is 
sold out, "a sign of continuing strong support for the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Records show that much of the money collected has come from prominent city 
lobbyists and Bradley's political appointees, or from special-interest groups 
that have business dealings with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Among those contributing $1,000 in recent months -- the maximum permitted -- 
were CH2M Hill California, an engineering firm with large city contracts; City 
Centre Development, a real estate partnership developing a huge downtown 
project, and H.J. Russell, Felker Ward and Jesse Hill, a trio of Atlanta 
businessmen with interests in various airport concession contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The report also reflects how the nature of the Bradley investigation has 
shifted in the past several months. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the bulk of the mayor's legal expenses were run up by the criminal 
defense firm of Fogel, Feldman, Ostrov, Ringer &amp; Klevens during a period 
when the city attorney was probing the mayor's ties to local financial firms. 
That inquiry ended without criminal charges, although Bradley agreed to pay a 
$20,000 fine for not properly disclosing personal investments. 
</P>
<P>
This year, most of the legal expenses have shifted to the firm of Miller &amp; 
O'Connell, specialists in securities cases who are representing Bradley in an 
ongoing U.S. Justice Department probe of the mayor, including possible insider 
trading violations.

USE OF SLAIN PASTOR'S CREDIT CARD LED POLICE TO SUSPECTS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: TWO STUDENTS WERE ARRESTED AT A TIRE STORE AFTER REPORTEDLY TRYING TO 
BUY CUSTOM RIMS. 
</P>

<P>
Two Northridge college students were arrested in the killing of a Pacoima 
pastor in a quarrel about a minor traffic accident because they repeatedly 
tried to use the dead man's credit card to buy wheel rims and tires, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Dana L. Singer, 18, a business major at Cal State Northridge, and Philip J. 
Dimenno, 19, who has been accepted to UC Santa Barbara on a scholarship, were 
each charged Thursday with one count of murder in the killing Saturday of Carl 
White, 54. 
</P>
<P>
The body of White, pastor of the Apostolic Temple Church on Van Nuys Boulevard 
in Pacoima, was found Sunday on the floor of his house in the 20100 block of 
Citronia Avenue in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested the suspects Tuesday after an employee of Apollo Tire in the 
6900 block of Reseda Boulevard called detectives when the young men returned to 
the store for a second time, trying to use White's credit card, the store 
employee said. 
</P>
<P>
"I detained them by telling them I had to get the rims from the warehouse," 
said the clerk, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I'd call the warehouse, but I really called the police. The 
detectives came in about four minutes." 
</P>
<P>
The tire store employee said Singer and Dimenno attempted to buy $1,700 worth 
of wheel rims and tires with White's credit card Monday but the credit card 
company rejected the purchase. The clerk quoted the pair as saying that they 
assumed the amount was over the card's limit and that they would return the 
next day to make a less expensive purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the employee said, the credit card issuer notified police that a 
purchase had been attempted on the card, which had been reported stolen after 
White's death. Detectives told the employee to delay the young men if they 
returned. They came back Tuesday to see if the credit card was good for a 
lesser amount, trying to buy four wheel rims for $1,200, the employee said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, prosecutors and defense lawyers confirmed the employee's account 
of the arrest. Although the young men allegedly stole White's credit card, they 
have not been charged with robbery because they did not enter the house 
intending to rob the pastor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Leland B. Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had learned that the pastor had been in a car accident the night before 
he was killed but the accident's connection to his death was not known until 
Dimenno and Singer were arrested, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Dimenno was a passenger in his car, which was being driven by an 
unidentified female friend when it was involved in a minor accident late Friday 
with a car driven by White. The cars collided after White slowed near the scene 
of a fatal traffic accident at Winnetka Avenue and Superior Street in 
Chatsworth, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Dimenno and White exchanged information from their driver's licenses and did 
not report the accident to police because the damage was minor, Los Angeles 
Police Detective Michael Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
Dimenno told police he later became concerned that the pastor might give 
Dimenno's driver's license number to police, and that he would be arrested on 
an outstanding traffic citation unrelated to the accident, Harris said. Dimenno 
and Singer, a friend who was not in the car when the accident happened, went to 
White's Chatsworth house about 6 a.m. Saturday to demand the number back, 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Dimenno took along a 9-millimeter pistol to threaten White if he refused to 
cooperate, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
During the confrontation, which lasted five to 15 minutes, White reportedly 
asked Dimenno to pay for repairs to his car and for a rental car, said 
Dimenno's attorney, Harold Greenberg. But Dimenno was reluctant to pay for the 
rental car, Greenberg said. During the argument, Singer panicked and fired one 
shot at White, Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet struck White in the back of the head, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Dimenno, who was leaving the house, did not see the shooting, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously not a murder case," Greenberg said. "At best, it's a 
manslaughter." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, however, said Dimenno was aware that Singer had a gun and that he 
intended to use it if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Singer and Dimenno appeared briefly in San Fernando Municipal Court on Thursday 
for their scheduled arraignment, which was postponed to Aug. 13. Both are 
charged with one count each of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Bail for the two suspects was set Thursday at $20,000 each, an unusually low 
amount because murder is generally considered a no-bail charge, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Harris said, his office did not ask for higher bail because of the 
defendants' age, their lack of a criminal record and because they live with 
their parents in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Dimenno was expected to post bail by Thursday evening, said his other attorney, 
Carter L. Phelps. Singer's attorney, James E. Blatt, would not comment when 
asked if his client would post bail. 
</P>
<P>
According to state Department of Motor Vehicles records, Dimenno received 
speeding tickets in September and December of 1988 and in February, 1990. 
Harris said Dimenno had been issued another speeding ticket last month. 
</P>
<P>
He said no warrant had been issued for Dimenno's arrest.

WEEKENDER: FISHING CONTEST ORGANIZERS EXPECT KIDS TO GO HOOK, LINE AND SINKER 
FOR THEIR SPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tim Waters What: Fishing clinic and contest for boys and girls (those under 
6 should be accompanied by a parent). When: Saturday, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Where: 
Polliwog Park, 1600 block of Manhattan Beach Boulevard. Admission: free. 
Information: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Carr's advice on how to keep kids out of trouble: Put a fishing pole in 
their hands. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a kid hooked on fishing, and he'll just never give it up," says the 
84-year-old Torrance resident and veteran angler. 
</P>
<P>
Come Saturday, Carr will gather his fishing gear and, for the 16th year in a 
row, head to Polliwog Park in Manhattan Beach where he and city recreation 
leaders will conduct a fishing clinic and contest for youngsters. Last year, 
nearly 150 children turned out to try their luck at hooking a fish at the 
park's acre-sized pond. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first fishing derby at the pond since a $426,000 project aimed at 
improving its water quality was completed about five months ago. The pond was 
drained and a liner composed of soil and concrete was installed along with 
aeration and filtration systems. 
</P>
<P>
And it is the first derby since the public flap that ensued after 83 ducks and 
geese that called the pond home were removed to make way for the project. The 
birds were killed after the city's Adopt-A-Duck program drew only one taker. 
Council members later decided not to replace the domestic ducks because their 
excretions posed a pollution problem. 
</P>
<P>
As for the fish that lived at the pond, some minnows were rescued by local Girl 
Scouts and put back into the pond once the renovation work was completed. Other 
not-so-lucky fish wound up as fertilizer for the park. 
</P>
<P>
The city has since restocked the pond with about 200 pounds of bluegill and 
catfish. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday affair is sponsored by the nonprofit American Youth Fishing 
Program, which Carr helped establish 18 years ago. Carr, who now serves as the 
program's executive director, said that over the years, contests have been held 
at numerous parks throughout the Los Angeles area. A contest held in Ventura 
County a few years ago drew more than 500 participants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Carr, who began fishing as a child when his uncle handed him a pole with a 
string tied to it, the contests are a labor of love. Carr said he sees the 
contests as a way of taking "a kid off the street and teaching him something 
he'll never forget." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful experience to get these kids out and let them catch fish," 
Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got kids that are married now and bringing their kids" to Polliwog, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said fishing is not normally allowed at the pond. However, the 
one-day contest gives some youngsters an opportunity they might not otherwise 
get. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody gets a free lesson, and hopefully everybody is going to be having a 
lot of fun," said Idris Al-Oboudi, a city recreation supervisor. "We hope this 
will turn on kids to a new recreational skill . . . that would bring them in 
touch with nature." 
</P>
<P>
City playground leaders will supervise the activities. Veterans such as Carr 
will demonstrate to the children how to make lures and tie knots, and how to 
cast. Prizes will be awarded to those youngsters who catch the most fish or the 
biggest fish, as well as to those who can cast the farthest with the most 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Although some fishing equipment will be available, participants should bring 
their own fishing gear, city officials said. They should also bring a sack 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
As for the unwilling participants -- the fish -- they have nothing to worry 
about. The rules require that they be released. Tim Waters What: Fishing clinic 
and contest for boys and girls (those under 6 should be accompanied by a 
parent). When: Saturday, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Where: Polliwog Park, 1600 block of 
Manhattan Beach Boulevard. Admission: free. Information: 545-5621, Ext. 328.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2,554-UNIT PROJECT OKD IN SANTA CLARITA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Thursday unanimously approved a 
2,554-unit housing development in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The project is part of the Dale Poe Development Corp.'s plans to build at least 
10,000 units in its giant Stevenson Ranch project west of the Golden State 
Freeway and south of Six Flags Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
The area school districts dropped their opposition to the project after the 
company agreed to donate land and cash to the schools worth $29.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the nearby city of Santa Clarita, however, testified on Thursday 
against the proposal. They said the county was not requiring the company to 
make enough provisions to handle the extra flow of traffic. Opponents also 
wanted a new environmental impact report written, to replace one completed in 
the mid-1980s.

THE LEGACY OF ART SEIDENBAUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Art Seidenbaum kick-started my writing career in Los Angeles eight years ago by 
assigning me book reviews (which he referred to as "chores"). At first I 
demurred, uncertain of being up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
But he bolstered my confidence, guiding me with his editing acumen, and on many 
occasions rescuing my writing from sure consignment to the dustbin with his 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
And he made an indelible impression. Whenever I self edit, I continually ask, 
"Would this pass muster with Art Seidenbaum?" The Irish have a phrase, "Ni bas 
acht a fas," which translated from the Gaelic means not dead but continuing to 
remain alive and, in fact, to grow in memory with time's passing. Every time I 
write something, Art Seidenbaum remains very much alive for me.

I have a sense of personal loss but also a feeling that that is dwarfed by a

judiciousness and compassion in an era of rampant ignorance and inane 
prejudices. Overall, a Renaissance man in a time when they're very scarce.

EDWARD A. ENGEL; MUSICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edward A. Engel, a former violist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the 
Glendale Symphony Orchestra, has died in Los Angeles. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
Engel, a longtime resident of Sherman Oaks, died Wednesday of complications 
from diabetes and kidney failure, said his wife, Rose Engel. 
</P>
<P>
Born Dec. 1, 1916, in Pittsburgh, Pa., Engel began a lifetime career teaching 
viola and violin at the age of 15. He was trained at the Curtis Institute of 
Music in Philadelphia. In 1947, he came to California and became a real estate 
broker in the San Fernando Valley, but his real love was music, and he 
performed with several orchestras in the area. 
</P>

JURY CONVICTS 2 TEEN-AGERS IN '89 KILLING OF STATION MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two teen-agers who used their friendship with the manager of a Redondo Beach 
gas station to get at the cash register and then shot him dead were convicted 
Wednesday of first-degree murder and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ponton, who was 17 at the time of the June, 1989, shooting, and Rickey 
Gary, who was 18, were convicted by a Torrance Superior Court jury that 
deliberated five hours before returning a verdict at the end of a three-week 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the murder and robbery charges, jurors also convicted the pair 
of special circumstances that require Judge John Shook to sentence them to life 
in prison without possibility of parole. Prosecutors did not seek the death 
penalty against either of them. 
</P>
<P>
Formal sentencing has been scheduled for Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses testified that Ponton and Gary plotted to support their crack cocaine 
habits by stealing the weekend gas receipts at the Arco station at Artesia 
Boulevard and Rindge Lane and then killed the station manager, Jesus (Chewy) 
Chavez, to prevent him from identifying them. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, two other teen-agers who helped plan the robbery but did not 
participate in the shooting testified against Ponton and Gary. 
</P>
<P>
Ponton, a former student at Redondo Union High School, was arrested at Pacific 
Shores Continuation High School in Manhattan Beach after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Gary, who was convicted of firing the shots that killed Chavez, lived in 
Compton.

THE LEGACY OF ART SEIDENBAUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am deeply saddened at the recent untimely passing of Art Seidenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
So assuredly are the many friends, readers and staff of the Los Angeles Times 
-- and the worldwide fraternity of journalism. 
</P>
<P>
Today's media are sometimes labeled hard, arrogant, insensitive and even 
malicious; Art Seidenbaum clearly refuted the labels. His rare and beautiful 
legacy shall be of a very generous, gracious and gifted man who was so thrilled 
with life and so proud of his paper and his profession that he thoroughly 
enjoyed challenging and inspiring similar gifts in others.

SEVERIN GRABIN; RETIRED REHABILITATION SPECIALIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Severin Grabin, a former director of the rehabilitation program at Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center, has died in Los Angeles. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime resident of Woodland Hills, Grabin died Monday of cancer, said his 
son, Michael Grabin. 
</P>
<P>
A Polish native, Grabin served as a lieutenant and a medical officer in the 
Polish Army Medical Corps during World War II and was honored with a medal of 
valor for helping many people escape Warsaw. He was captured by the Nazis, but 
because they did not realize he was Jewish, he was sent to a prisoner of war 
camp instead of a concentration camp. He was the only member of his family to 
survive the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, he came to the United States and received postgraduate training 
at the University of Colorado. In 1951, he began working for Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center, then Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, in the rehabilitation 
department. He served as rehabilitation coordinator from 1957 to 1970, until he 
was promoted to administrative director of physical medicine and 
rehabilitation. He retired in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
From 1967 to 1984, Grabin was on the executive board of the Southern California 
chapter of the National Rehabilitation Assn. and served as president in 1973. 
He served on two of the mayor's advisory committees for the handicapped between 
1976 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 39 years, Mary Elizabeth Grabin of Woodland 
Hills; sons Michael Adam Grabin of Woodland Hills and Richard Brooke Grabin of 
Sacramento; one step-grandson; and one step-grandaughter. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service is scheduled for today at 1 p.m. at Mount Sinai Memorial Park 
Chapel, 5950 Forest Lawn Drive, Los Angeles. Interment will follow at the same 
location.

THE LEGACY OF ART SEIDENBAUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Art Seidenbaum will be sorely missed by free-lance writers. As former editor of 
Book Review, Art encouraged off-the-beaten-path stories about literary Los 
Angeles that appeared in the phased-out Westview column. 
</P>
<P>
And he could be kind even when he had to be cruel. Rejected articles, when he 
served as Opinion editor, were always accompanied by a comforting word or two 
of explanation. The sight of his name on a Times envelope always set my heart 
aflutter. 
</P>
<P>
And however brief the note's contents, he invariably closed with a kind of life 
motif: "Cheers, Art."

5 ARE FINALISTS TO HEAD COMPTON SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The list of candidates for superintendent of schools has been narrowed to five 
who will be interviewed by the Board of Education on Aug. 11, according to the 
consultant hired to help find a new schools chief. 
</P>
<P>
Latino leaders in Compton want the board, which has six black members and one 
Latino member, to make acting Supt. Elisa L. Sanchez superintendent. This year, 
Latino children are more than half of the district's approximately 26,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson Riles, former state superintendent of public instruction and now the 
head of his own Sacramento search firm, declined to reveal the names of the 
finalists for the top job in the Compton Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 educators, Riles said, applied for the Compton job, which became 
vacant in January when Supt. Ted D. Kimbrough left to become head of the 
Chicago public school system. Sanchez joined the district in 1983 as an 
assistant superintendent of educational services and later became deputy 
superintendent until the board named her acting superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Riles said he believes the choice will be made by the opening of school Sept. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever gets the job faces a multitude of critical problems. For years, Compton 
student test scores have been among the lowest in the state; the dropout rate 
is among the highest. School buildings are badly deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
Labor relations have been poor for years, too. Teachers, among the lowest paid 
in Los Angeles County, have been working for two years without a contract 
because their union and the school board cannot agree on salaries. In addition, 
the district had to make deep cuts in its budget this year to balance it. 
</P>
<P>
Starting pay for teachers in Compton is $23,226, compared to about $27,000 in 
the Los Angeles Unified School District. According to a report issued in April 
by a state researcher helping to negotiate a teacher contract in Compton, the 
maximum salary for teachers is $37,575, while the average highest salary for 
the top 10 districts in Los Angeles County is $44,569. 
</P>
<P>
Riles said he and his staff met with parents to find out what sort of 
superintendent they want. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very concerned about the achievement level of their kids," he said. 
"When they look at the test scores that are published, their kids are always 
low on the scale and they want that turned around. They want to be sure that 
the money the district gets is efficiently spent and not wasted."

IS COLLECTIVE SECURITY JUST A CHIMERA?;

THREE THINGS ARE REQUIRED: U.S. LEADERSHIP, SOVIET COOPERATION AND WILLINGNESS 
TO USE FORCE AS A LAST RESORT.

The Cold War has not quite been laid to its final rest when the international 
community finds itself rudely disabused of any notion that a time of grace will 
follow automatically. The post-Cold War world could be a better, more peaceful 
one than we have known for several generations. Or it could be a world replete 
with new terrors of its own -- the terrors of anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council acted with uncommon speed and unanimity in condemning 
the Iraqi invasion. This was exactly what the U.N. founders -- and before them, 
the founders of the League of Nations -- had in mind. Peace would rest on a 
system of "collective security" in which all the other nations would join 
forces against any aggressor. The system has not worked because the 
superpowers' interests have been so antagonistic and so ubiquitous. In most 
local conflicts the two would end up on opposite sides, thereby paralyzing the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of the Cold War opens the door to international cooperation to 
uphold peace and world law. But by the same token it makes less likely 
unilateral action by the United States or the Western alliance. Were Kuwait 
still a pawn on the East-West chess board, the American reaction to Iraq's 
threats would not have been so muted. The abatement of American and Soviet 
fears of each other could have the ironic consequence of leaving local bullies, 
like Iraq's Saddam Hussein, freer than before to throw their weight around. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative to such an unhappy outcome is for the community of nations to 
thwart aggressors. In this instance, that means to compel Iraq to withdraw from 
Kuwait unconditionally, without leaving behind a puppet government and without 
securing any of the demands on which it based its attack. It is good that the 
Security Council passed a resolution. But can it be enforced? 
</P>
<P>
Even before the Cold War, collective security had failed. In the 1930s, when 
Japan attacked Manchuria and Mussolini's Italy conquered Abyssinia, the League 
of Nations responded with ineffectual diplomatic and economic slaps on the 
wrist. No nation wanted to risk the ire of the aggressors or interrupt its own 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The same spirit of greed and cowardice are afoot in the world today. Indeed, it 
has been abundantly in evidence toward Iraq in recent years. Although Saddam 
Hussein launched aggressive war against Iran, used poison gas on his own 
Kurdish subjects and threatened Israel with weapons of mass destruction, 
Western governments have collaborated shamelessly in the development of Iraq's 
military industries, including its potential for chemical and nuclear warfare. 
</P>
<P>
If collective security is to be any more successful after the Cold War than it 
was before, that selfish, pusillanimous spirit will have to be overcome. This 
will require three things: American leadership, Soviet cooperation and 
willingness to use force as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
The Cold War's end leaves America more than ever the world's premier power. 
America also tends to be the most idealistic country. We must set an example of 
courage and principle for others to follow. The alternative is collective 
inaction. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Soviet role: Mikhail Gorbachev's "new thinking" has wrought a 
revolution in Soviet external behavior. It has turned away from imperialism 
toward cooperation. It has helped to solve local conflicts in Namibia and 
Nicaragua, and there are signs that it is cooperating in a similar way in 
several other countries. A further step of cooperation would be for the Soviets 
to join with America, the moderate Arabs and others in united action against 
Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that strong enough diplomatic and financial pressures will lead 
Iraq to back down. It is a country with some formidable enemies -- Syria, 
Israel, Iran. This may make it especially vulnerable to international 
isolation. But non-martial pressures will be all the more effective if Iraq 
knows that the other nations are ultimately prepared to take whatever measures 
are necessary to reverse its aggression. 
</P>
<P>
More than Kuwait's sovereignty is at stake. Successful collective action could 
spell the beginning of a new, more peaceful era. Failure to act would set a 
precedent of a different sort. It would suggest that the end of the Cold War, 
while leaving the superpowers more secure, will also leave them more 
indifferent to the fate of small countries that may find themselves more 
vulnerable than ever.

HOUSE PASSES BILL TO LET AIRPORTS LEVY FLIERS' FEE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: THE CHARGE -- UP TO $12 ON A ROUND-TRIP DOMESTIC FLIGHT -- 
WOULD ALLOW CROWDED FACILITIES TO EXPAND. BUT KEY SENATORS OPPOSE IT. 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House approved a bill Thursday to allow most of the nation's airports to 
impose a new passenger fee that could add as much as $12 to the cost of a 
round-trip domestic flight and raise $1 billion a year for U.S. airport 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt by California Rep. Doug Bosco (D-Occidental) to kill the proposed 
"head tax" as regressive and unnecessary was rejected on a 252-171 roll-call 
vote before the House adopted the bill by an overwhelming vote of 405 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, however, faces an uphill battle in the Senate. Key lawmakers 
there said they oppose the Administration-backed fee and would let the House 
bill die by refusing to take action on it before Congress adjourns this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the fee said it would help pay for new or improved airports in 
major hubs, reducing congestion and delays for millions of passengers. 
Opponents said an existing aviation trust fund already contains nearly $8 
billion that could be spent for airport modernization. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers support that fund through an 8% ticket tax, and some airlines -- 
themselves hit with municipal or county airport taxes -- levy surcharges of 
their own. Delta Air Lines, for example, levies a $2-per-ticket surcharge for 
passengers flying from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, travelers entering the United States must pay $5 in customs users' 
fees, even if their bags are not inspected. That fee is unrelated to airport 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the plan approved Thursday by the House, Rep. Pat Williams 
(D-Mont.) said, "There won't be enough airsick bags on the planes to take care 
of the nauseated public." 
</P>
<P>
But strong support from Republicans, and big-city Democrats whose airports 
would benefit most from the proposal, won the day. A total of 134 Republicans 
and 118 Democrats voted for the fee, while 131 Democrats and 40 Republicans 
tried to kill it. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates compared the fee to a toll that motorists pay on bridges or 
turnpikes. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is preparing for the 21st Century," argued Rep. Lawrence Coughlin 
(R-Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, most airports would be allowed to charge up to $3 for each 
passenger using the facility. If a traveler made a stopover at a second 
fee-charging airport on the same trip, another fee of up to $3 could be 
charged, but the maximum would be $12 for a round trip. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would require the secretary of transportation to approve 
requests by the major airport authorities that wanted to impose the fee for 
expansion or noise-abatement projects. Airports that are supported by 
"Essential Air Service" subsidies -- basically airports in small towns and 
rural areas -- would be barred from charging the fee under the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Under another provision of the bill, the 71 leading airports in the nation 
would be required to turn over half their receipts from the new fee to the 
federal government until they had repaid 50% of the federal airways improvement 
grants they now receive. 
</P>
<P>
California airports that would be affected by this provision would be Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, Orange County's John Wayne, San Jose, Oakland, 
Sacramento, San Diego and Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's desire for a third airport to relieve overcrowding at O'Hare and 
Midway was a driving force behind the bill, according to Bosco and other 
opponents. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, strongly supported the new fee as essential for future expansion, 
noting that a third Chicago airport would cost nearly $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But California Rep. Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose) accused the Bush 
Administration of bottling up the surplus in the aviation trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers should not be asked again to pay for improvements when the money 
already paid is hidden away in the Office of Management and Budget version of a 
Swiss bank account," he said. "Airline passengers are about to be taken for a 
ride by the White House and Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have long complained that the money is being stashed away unspent to 
falsely improve the budget-deficit picture. 
</P>
<P>
Mineta and other opponents said President Bush has already asked that the 8% 
ticket tax be increased to 10% -- a hike likely to be approved by Congress as 
part of a deficit-reduction package later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the fee included a sweetener in the legislation to attract votes 
from rural lawmakers. The bill would earmark some of the money received from 
the "head tax" for smaller airports, which would be barred from imposing their 
own passenger service fee. 
</P>
<P>
Congress banned airports from imposing similar fees in 1973. Advocates of 
lifting the ban said, however, that the new fees would be limited in amount and 
carefully controlled to see that they were used only for airport improvements.

GOLD AT FIRST SOARS BUT GIVES UP SOME GAINS

Gold prices rose sharply Thursday in response to the invasion of Kuwait but 
closed well below trading peaks reached early in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Gold for current delivery soared above $385 an ounce in early trading but ended 
the session at $376.80, up $3.50, on New York's Commodity Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Precious metals analysts said the initial dramatic price run-up was mainly 
because of hasty "short covering" by speculators who, until the invasion news, 
had expected the price of gold to drop. Ian C. MacDonald, manager of the 
Precious Metals Corporate Advisory of Credit Suisse in New York, said: "There 
was terrific short covering overnight," referring to Wednesday night and early 
Thursday morning Pacific time. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, however, profit taking set in, and mining companies stepped 
in to sell gold and take advantage of the higher price, helping to drive prices 
back down. 
</P>
<P>
Precious metals such as gold are often considered a safe haven in times of 
crisis. Gold prices typically rise when world tensions escalate. 
</P>
<P>
In London, gold rose to $378.75 an ounce from $374.30 late Wednesday. The 
precious metal rose in Zurich to $379 from $371.50 late Tuesday. (The Zurich 
market was closed Wednesday because of a holiday.) Earlier, gold in Hong Kong 
rose $7.93 to close at $379.39.

MacDonald predicted that the gold market may be erratic, reacting to news 
developments in the Middle East. "This market will certainly be news- or 
rumor-driven for the next several days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey A. Nichols, president of American Precious Metals Advisors, said he 
expects the price of gold in coming months to rise, especially if the U.S. 
dollar weakens. He said demand for gold is unusually high now, mainly because 
of exceptionally strong sales of jewelry worldwide. Supplies also have been 
tight, in part because South African production has fallen and Soviet sales of 
gold have been lower. 
</P>
<P>
John H. O'Connell, senior metals analyst at Refco Inc., a major commodities 
brokerage, said the determining factor in gold price movements will be whether 
the dollar weakens. He said price increases are likely to be gradual, "not 
driven by runaway enthusiasm."

<P>
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait shocked an already gloomy stock market Thursday, 
sending the Dow Jones industrial index skidding 34.66 in the heaviest trading 
since last October's 190-point mini-crash. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein "has put the fear of God in everyone," said 
Andrew Riley, market strategist with Yamaichi International in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Iraqi incursion quickly lifted oil and gold stocks, it clobbered 
those of the auto companies and others whose fortunes are tied to fuel costs. 
Also battered were the shares of many of the blue chip growth stocks and other 
issues that had held up the market until recent sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The New York market's decline, which left the Dow off 1.2% at 2,864.60, 
mirrored dives in the London and Tokyo markets, which slumped sharply on news 
of the pre-dawn incursion. Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell 1.9%; the 
London market's Financial Times stock index of 100 shares lost 1.5% of its 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 253.09 million shares, compared to 
176.81 million shares Wednesday and 416.29 million shares in the plunge last 
Oct. 13. On the Big Board, losers swamped rising stocks 1,211 to 464. 
</P>
<P>
The invasion raised the kind of general uncertainties that traders so dislike. 
It was also read as a portent of rising oil prices, which could fuel inflation 
and keep the Federal Reserve Board from easing interest rates. These worries 
mingled with recent anxieties about bad corporate earnings and a weakening 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The upshot is, nobody wants any unnecessary exposure in a market like this," 
said John Luvin, vice president of New Japan Securities in New York. "There's 
been a weak underlying tone, and now this." 
</P>
<P>
He said traders were also concerned that congressional budget negotiators might 
scrap consideration of any new energy taxes in the face of the latest rise in 
oil prices. This suggested that a deal to ease the budget deficit may not be 
forthcoming, which might in turn work to keep interest rates high. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were also focused on the government's monthly employment figures that 
are due today and the prospect of a major Treasury bond sale next week, Luvin 
said. The bond sale, by suggesting demand for government securities, could have 
wide effects on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
But by late afternoon, others were hopeful that the market had already come 
through the worst of the crisis. The Dow had been off as much as 45 points 
early in the day. Iraq's announcement that it planned to leave Kuwaiti soil 
"sounds to some people like this is going to be settled quickly," said Ken 
Ducey, head of institutional trading for S. G. Warburg &amp; Co. in New York. 
"They've done what they wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Dow's drop would have been far steeper without the upward lift provided by 
the oil stocks. Texaco, Exxon and Chevron soared, leading energy stocks in 
general sharply higher. (Story, D4.) 
</P>
<P>
Broader indexes fell like the Dow. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index 
was off 4.04 to 351.48, or 1.1%. Small stocks suffered worse, as the NASDAQ 
over-the-counter composite index tumbled 7.02 to 428.89, or 1.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Leading the Dow lower were Boeing, off 2 1/4 to 53 1/2; Procter &amp; Gamble, 
down 3 1/4 to 82 1/4, and Merck, down 2 5/8 to 87 1/4. Many other growth stocks 
were hard hit, including Disney, down 4 5/8 to 111 3/4, and Circus Circus, down 
6 3/4 to 54 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* GM dropped 1 1/2 to 43 7/8. Ford lost 1 1/4 to 39 7/8, and Chrysler fell 5/8 
to 14 3/8, both new 52-week lows. 
</P>
<P>
* High-tech stocks plummeted, giving back more of the gains they racked up in 
the second quarter. AST Research lost 1 3/8 to 19 3/4, Intel dropped 2 1/4 to 
40 1/4 and Compaq fell 1 3/4 to 53. 
</P>
<P>
* Investors continued to hit bank and S&amp;L stocks mercilessly because of 
worries about further loan losses in a weak economy. Wells Fargo dropped 2 3/8 
to 63 1/2, Manufacturers Hanover lost 1 1/4 to 28 1/4 and Golden West fell 1 
3/4 to 27 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Among the few non-oil gainers, insurer Twentieth Century Industries rose 1 to 
25 on a strong earnings report. Also, some defense stocks rose on speculation 
that the Iraq-Kuwait crisis will cause Congress to rethink defense budget cuts. 
Lockheed added 5/8 to 28, McDonnell Douglas gained 1 to 44 and Rockwell rose 
3/8 to 27. 
</P>
<P>
* Utilities, which had rallied in recent days as investors sought a safe haven, 
mostly lost ground. Exceptions were natural gas companies, including Pacific 
Enterprises, up 1 1/8 to 38 3/4, and Columbia Gas, up 1 1/8 to 48 5/8.

TIMES MIRROR BUYS 50% STAKE IN LA OPINION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times Mirror, the media company that publishes the Los Angeles Times, on 
Thursday said it has agreed to buy a 50% stake in La Opinion, the Los Angeles 
newspaper that ranks as the nation's largest Spanish-language daily. 
</P>
<P>
La Opinion and The Times will maintain completely separate staffs and 
operations, according to executives of both papers. "Our ties will have been 
strengthened, but the Times and La Opinion will remain completely independent," 
said David Laventhol, president of Los Angeles-based Times Mirror and publisher 
of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the transaction was not disclosed. Laventhol said no additional 
investment in La Opinion is planned. 
</P>
<P>
La Opinion will retain its Spanish-language format, and no management changes 
are anticipated as a result of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the partnership with The Times Mirror Co.," La Opinion publisher Jose 
Lozano said in a statement, "we can continue to strengthen the newspaper, 
expand its coverage and make it even more relevant to the lives of our 
readers." 
</P>
<P>
Southern California's rapidly growing Latino community -- which numbers about 4 
million -- has helped boost La Opinion's circulation in recent years. Daily 
circulation grew by 17% in 1989 and now stands at about 100,000. The Times' 
circulation totals about 1.2 million daily and 1.5 million on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The mushrooming Latino community has attracted other Spanish-language daily 
newspapers, including Noticias del Mundo, which is owned by the Unification 
Church. A third daily -- El Diario de Los Angeles, which was financed by a 
Mexican newspaper chain and other investors -- closed in October, 1989, after 2 
1/2 years in operation. Noticias has a circulation estimated at 35,000 to 
50,000, and El Diario's circulation never rose above 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Buying into La Opinion may help Times Mirror tap into the growth of Southern 
California's burgeoning Latino population. In the past three decades, the 
Latino population of Los Angeles has grown to more than 3 million from 580,000. 
In the next decade, it is expected to reach more than 4 million, about 40% of 
the population. Already, The Times publishes a bilingual supplement, Nuestro 
Tiempo, that is distributed 15 times a year in heavily Latino communities. 
Nuestro Tiempo will continue to be published, Laventhol said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to The Times, Times Mirror publishes a number of newspapers, 
including Newsday and the Baltimore Sun, owns a chain of television stations 
and is involved in magazine and book publishing. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership between The Times and La Opinion is "something that's been 
under consideration for some time," Laventhol said. "The Latino community is an 
increasingly important part of our readership." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a new board of directors will be created to oversee the 
partnership, with a majority of the board composed of representatives of La 
Opinion, which is owned by Lozano Enterprises of California. 
</P>
<P>
La Opinion was founded in 1926 by Lozano's grandfather, and the paper has 
remained a family-controlled operation since. 
</P>
<P>
La Opinion and The Times have a history of cooperation with each other. They 
have worked together on public information supplements, collaborated on stories 
and shared facilities during emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase agreement is subject to review by federal antitrust officials. "We 
have reviewed this (the antitrust question) and are satisfied, and feel it is 
correct to proceed and would not have done so otherwise," Laventhol said.

Court Rules in Boeing's Favor: The Washington state Supreme Court ruled that 
the families of Japanese nationals who died in the crash of a Boeing 747 five 
years ago in Japan cannot seek damages from the airplane manufacturer in U.S. 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, if it stands, means all damage claims must be tried in Japanese 
courts. The ruling was a major victory for Boeing Co. because high damage 
awards are much harder to obtain in Japan. Boeing lost the liability portion of 
the case earlier when a Superior Court judge said faulty repairs resulted in 
cracks in the plane, which led to the crash.

L.A. LAW FIRM WINS SUIT OVER CLIENT RAIDING; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: A JUDGE RULED THAT 12 PARTNERS WHO HAD DECIDED TO LEAVE WYMAN 
BAUTZER ILLEGALLY PERSUADED CLIENTS TO JUMP TO THE NEW PRACTICE THEY WERE 
FORMING.

The prominent Los Angeles law firm of Wyman Bautzer Kuchel &amp; Silbert has 
won a major victory over a group of former partners who left in 1988 and took 
some of the company's biggest clients with them. 
</P>
<P>
Retired temporary Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lester E. Olson ruled Monday 
that partners of Wyman Bautzer -- then known as Wyman Bautzer Christensen 
Kuchel &amp; Silbert -- did not force out the group of 12 partners, who were 
led by a former colleague, Terry N. Christensen. Christensen, who left in 1987 
to work for financier Kirk Kerkorian, tried to engineer a return to the firm 
early in 1988 -- reportedly as managing partner -- but no agreement could be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
A split developed, and the 12 Wyman Bautzer partners joined Christensen to form 
a law firm called Christensen, White, Miller, Fink &amp; Jacobs. The group then 
sued to dissolve the old Wyman Bautzer partnership, contending that relations 
had become too bitter for the partners to work together. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the Christensen group also objected to the way that 1988 
income was distributed after the breakup. 
</P>
<P>
Olson ruled that the Christensen group "improperly solicited" clients of Wyman 
Bautzer to try to persuade them to leave the firm and hire the Christensen 
group. This was done even before the Christensen lawyers left Wyman Bautzer, he 
said. Some of the clients who switched firms were Capital Cities/ABC, MGM/UA 
and Campbell Soup. 
</P>
<P>
"A certain amount of dissension and angst lurks in the cavernous streets of 
Century City and pervades the business of the practice of law there and in 
other parts of metropolitan Los Angeles County," Olson wrote. "Therefore, what 
might at first blush appear to be insoluble disputes, bitterness and dissension 
become management problems capable of solution, at least when they are not 
subjected to the outside interference imposed by Christensen." 
</P>
<P>
Christensen denied that his firm did anything wrong in soliciting clients or in 
the way the lawyers left Wyman Bautzer. 
</P>
<P>
"Clients have a right to change law firms whenever they want to," he said. 
Christensen said the firm plans to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Howard L. Weitzman, a partner with Wyman Bautzer, called the ruling "a complete 
and total win." 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing wrong with leaving and going into business for yourself, and 
there's nothing wrong with competing," Weitzman said. But, he added, "when they 
actually made the move, they tried to blow up the law firm." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling detailed some contentious doings at Wyman Bautzer, including a 
"temper tantrum" by one attorney during a partners meeting (he stayed with the 
firm) and the appropriation by another attorney (who left with the dissidents) 
of eight choice Dodger season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the tickets were the subject of a lawsuit filed by Rosalind Weiner 
Wyman, widow of one of the law firm's founders. Wyman, who as a member of the 
Los Angeles City Council was instrumental in bringing the Dodgers to Los 
Angeles in 1958, contended that the law firm breached an agreement that would 
have given her the chance to buy the front-row box seats behind the Dodger 
dugout under certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
That dispute was smoothed over. The tickets were returned to Wyman Bautzer, and 
a settlement was negotiated under which Rosalind Wyman gets the seats for one 
out of every three games. 
</P>
<P>
In the upcoming part of the trial that determines the amount of damages, 
Christensen White must show "that there is no causal connection between their 
breach of duty and the loss of certain clients of the old Wyman firm," Olson 
said. That phase also will determine whether Wyman Bautzer owes Terry 
Christensen any more money after previously paying him $271,000.

CHRYSLER PLANS SMALL PRICE INCREASE ON ITS '91 MODELS

Chrysler Corp.'s 1991 cars, Jeeps and minivans will cost a modest 0.9% more 
than this year's vehicles, a smaller increase than is expected by the other two 
Big Three auto makers, an executive said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Chrysler wants to wean buyers from such incentives as cash rebates and 
low-interest financing that have added more than $1,000 to the company's cost 
for each of its cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ford Motor Co. said average prices for its 1991 cars would be 3.2% 
higher than current models. Prices for Ford's 1991 trucks will rise an average 
of 3.6%. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp. has not released prices for the full line of its 1991 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler will lower by $1,100 the sticker price on the Dodge Monaco LE. The 
Dodge Dynasty will cost $560 more than this year. 
</P>
<P>
All the comparisons involve comparably equipped vehicles. Popular optional 
equipment on one model year's vehicles often is included as standard equipment 
on later models. That boosts the price and makes year-to-year comparisons 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Also muddying year-to-year comparisons is padding the auto maker builds into 
prices for incentives. 
</P>
<P>
"We've allowed allowances for rebates and incentives in the '91 prices," 
Chrysler Motors Chairman Bennett Bidwell said Thursday. "We would hope to 
de-escalate the use of incentives." 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to put ourselves in a very competitive price position versus the 
rest of the industry to increase our market share," Bidwell said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "No one, certainly not Chrysler, is going to turn this 
parade around." 
</P>
<P>
During the past several years, each of the Big Three has offered a variety of 
incentives, mostly cash rebates and low-interest financing, to help sell its 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of incentives comes directly out of profits. During the past two 
weeks, each of the Big Three has blamed incentives for driving down their 
second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler reported it made $180 million during the period, 47.2% less than last 
year. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said profit would have been up if Chrysler had 
avoided paying consumers to buy cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
GM, which reported a 40% profit decline, and Ford, whose profit fell 45%, said 
they also were hurt by the cost of incentives, as well as by economic problems 
in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
GM won't say precisely how much it spent on incentives during the quarter. Ford 
put its average cost at $1,050 per vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Like its competitors, Chrysler boosted prices on its 1990 models earlier this 
year. Chrysler's tentative prices announced Thursday were 1.3% higher than 1990 
prices before the earlier increase.

OIL STOCKS SOAR, REFINERS FALL ON IRAQ ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oil stocks, lifted last week by an OPEC price accord and signs of tension in 
the Persian Gulf, posted sharp gains Thursday as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent 
oil prices to their highest levels since January. 
</P>
<P>
Although stocks overall declined steeply in the heaviest trading since October, 
energy-related issues surged on expectations of higher oil prices from a 
possible disruption of Middle East production. 
</P>
<P>
After an opening frenzy propelled oil stocks to daily highs, they closed the 
session with more modest gains. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the New York Stock Exchange's most active list was Chevron, closing up 
$1.675 at $80.375. Texaco was the second most active issue, finishing the day 
up $2.675 at $66.675. Other gaining issues included Unocal, up $2.125 to 
$33.25; Amoco, $2.875 to $58.25, and Atlantic Richfield, $5.00 to $135.50. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that companies with major oil reserves and exploration units 
stand to gain the most from a rise in crude oil prices, while firms that 
concentrate on refining and marketing could suffer. 
</P>
<P>
The stock of large refiners fell, reflecting tighter profit margins from higher 
crude prices. Sun Co. lost $1.375 to $35.50, and Ashland Oil fell $1.625 to 
$32.25. 
</P>
<P>
"Refiners usually have their margins squeezed in the short term," said Craig 
Schwerdt, an analyst with Drake Capital Securities in Santa Monica. "There 
usually is a 30- to 60-day lag before costs are passed downstream." 
</P>
<P>
Oil-service stocks, however, climbed sharply. Schlumberger rose $2.25 to 
$68.75, Halliburton gained $1.75 to $57.375 and Baker Hughes advanced $1.375 to 
$33.375. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just more confidence in projects as the price of oil goes up," said 
David Neisser, manager of Fidelity Select Energy Services, a mutual fund 
investing in oil service stocks. "As the price goes up, projects that the oil 
companies were considering become viable. Therefore, the service companies will 
be more in demand." 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices jumped worldwide on news of Iraq's aggression in the Persian Gulf, 
which produces almost 25% of the world's oil. West Texas intermediate, the 
benchmark U.S. grade of crude, jumped $1.57 to $23.11 a barrel for September 
delivery. In London, North Sea Brent blend traded as high as $24 a barrel, up 
$3.20 and its highest price in four years. 
</P>
<P>
The increases follow an agreement by the 13 nations of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries last week to raise the target price of an average 
barrel of OPEC oil to $21 from $18, and to raise cartel production to 22.5 
million barrels a day, a 400,000-barrel increase.

AIRLINES PICKED FOR NEW ROUTES TO JAPAN

<P>
An administrative law judge recommended Thursday that five U.S. airlines be 
awarded direct routes to Japan from six U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
The judge picked United, Delta, American, Continental and America West airlines 
to fly the new routes in what is already a $6-billion annual aviation market 
for the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
Cities getting new flights would be Chicago; Los Angeles; San Jose; Portland, 
Ore.; Seattle, and Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
The complex, 90-page recommendation followed applications by a dozen carriers 
to serve various U.S.-Japan routes under a new international air agreement. 
Transportation Department officials are expected to make a final decision on 
the carriers and routes in November. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John J. Mathias selected United Air Lines for Chicago-Tokyo and proposed 
that two routes be awarded to Delta Air Lines: Los Angeles-Tokyo and 
Portland-Nagoya. Other carriers and routes he recommended were American 
Airlines for San Jose-Tokyo, Continental Airlines for Seattle-Nagoya, and 
America West Airlines for Honolulu-Nagoya. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, it would be the first Japanese route for America West. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines that sought routes but got none were Hawaiian, Northwest, Pan 
American and Trans World. Mathias also rejected applications that would have 
added direct flights between Japan and St. Louis, Houston and the Hawaiian 
island of Maui. 
</P>
<P>
Mathias said his recommendations followed department guidelines for awarding 
the routes and would enhance competition among airlines and cities to be 
served.

FEARING TOXICS LIABILITY, LENDERS LIMIT SOME LOANS

Farmers, furniture refinishers and funeral homes are being denied credit 
because lenders fear being stuck with cleanup costs if pollution is found on 
the properties, the president of a small Ohio bank told Congress on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses that use chemicals such as auto paint and embalming fluids and 
properties with underground storage tanks are considered undesirable loan risks 
because of recent court interpretations of the 10-year-old federal Superfund 
law, said R. Duane Lillibridge, president of Farmers Savings Bank in Northwood, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Farmland "is considered highly suspect, and unfortunately we are being forced 
to wind down our loans in this critical sector of our economy," Lillibridge 
told the House transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are unable to obtain some relief . . . Ohio bankers will soon be unable 
to look to real estate as collateral," he said in prepared testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The Superfund law gave the federal government the power to move in on heavily 
polluted properties, clean up the contamination and then force the property 
owners to pay for it. In May, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that 
a lender that forecloses on a polluted property could be held liable for 
cleanup costs under Superfund. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said the court rulings 
on Superfund liability could have an ominous impact on the $500-billion 
taxpayer cost of the savings and loan bailout and "inflate these astronomical 
figures even more." 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. submitted testimony estimating that 270 
properties in its possession may have Superfund problems, Luken said. 
</P>
<P>
"All American taxpayers have an important stake in how these problems are 
resolved," said Luken, who supports a bill by Rep. John LaFale (D-N.Y.) to 
exempt lenders from Superfund liability when they foreclose on contaminated 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) criticized the bill this week in a letter to fellow 
House members. "The bill condones bad loans to polluting businesses and tells 
lenders that the government will clean up after them," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency submitted testimony announcing that it 
intends to resolve the question by issuing a rule "expeditiously." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA agrees that lender liability "needs to be as certain and predictable as 
possible," testified James M. Strock, the agency's assistant administrator for 
enforcement.

HOT TO SHOP: VENICE BEACH FLEXES ITS SHOPPING MUSCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER and JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HOT: My friends shop at the Venice Beach boardwalk and come home with 
really cute stuff at very reasonable prices. I go there and all I see are 
"Life's a Beach" T-shirts. Is there anything new? Where is it? 
</P>
<P>
 -- R.K., GARDENA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR R.K.: This is the Coney Island of shopping experiences, not a place where 
you glide daintily to and from well-appointed emporiums. Venice Beach wants to 
entertain you, so let it. 
</P>
<P>
We found many inexpensive treasures on the boardwalk, where there's more than 
surfer jams and sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
What first caught our eye was "Bud the Birdman," a new addition this summer. 
For $5, Bud will take a Polaroid of you wearing one of his giant parrots in 
your hair. After a parrot dances on your head, you'll be in a better mood to 
ferret out the boardwalk's latest treasures. Be sure to see Linda Lagosse and 
Magnus Walker's Venetian Paradise stand at 640 Ocean Front Walk (between Sunset 
and Thornton). Their designs include whimsical '60s-inspired Mad Hatter-type 
hats and funky patchwork overalls, vests and jeans. 
</P>
<P>
Reckless Women, at 421 Ocean Front Walk, has a good selection of inexpensive 
costume jewelry, including rhinestone earrings, colorful bangle bracelets and 
hair ornaments. And be sure to stop in at All One People, 1011 Ocean Front 
Walk, which was recently transformed into a candle shop for a scene in the 
upcoming film "The Doors." In real life the shop carries a great selection of 
ethnic clothing, jewelry and accessories from Guatemala, Africa and Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
We found the merchants friendly and talkative. Have a good time -- and don't 
forget your sunscreen! 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HOT: My husband and I will be attending several black-tie affairs this 
fall, and for once I'd like to know what's appropriate to wear. Sales people 
suggest everything from strapless cocktail dresses to ball gowns! Is there any 
clear-cut definition? 
</P>
<P>
 -- D.V., SANTA MONICA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR D.V.: Etiquette expert Letitia "Tish" Baldrige lays it on the line in her 
book, "Complete Guide to Executive Manners." For the fall and winter seasons, 
she recommends a short, three-quarter or full-length evening dress of a "winter 
evening fabric," such as satin, brocade, sequins, lame or heavy taffeta. 
Jewelry can be glittery (real or faux); shoes and evening bags should match 
(patent leather or peau de soie work well), and evening hosiery should be 
sheer. 
</P>
<P>
Tish offers safe, sage advice, but this is Los Angeles, where some people 
believe studded black leather constitutes formal wear. And since there's 
nothing worse than showing up for an event dressed inappropriately (it's been 
the subject of several of our nightmares), we suggest finding out as much about 
the event as you can before you go, perhaps by consulting the host or hostess, 
or by asking someone else who's going. That way, you can find out if a short 
dress would be appropriate or if most of the women will be wearing long gowns.

The white wall beside the front door of Hella-Barbara Rank's home and studio in 
Brentwood reads "Villa d'Esperance" -- the house of hope. 
</P>
<P>
For the German-born clothing designer who relocated here in the late '80s, it 
has indeed been a house of hope, a place to restart a fashion career by way of 
a small-scale couture business. 
</P>
<P>
After 7 1/2 years of fashion education and training at the Munich Fashion 
School and various designing jobs in Munich-based couture houses, Hella-Barbara 
Jahke unexpectedly found herself moving to Mexico to become the art director of 
Vanity, a large clothing company. At the end of 15 years in Mexico, she married 
an American and moved to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Now divorced, she turned to designing, which seemed the logical choice, 
"because it was what I learned and what I did best." 
</P>
<P>
"My clothing has a terribly understated style that's nothing like Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
Her fabrics are opulent: brocade, quilted iridescent taffeta, silk chiffon and 
organza, sheer lace and crushed velvet. But shapes are clean and simple -- 
fingertip-length cardigans are the basic pieces upon which the entire 
collection revolves. These long and lean jackets are paired with a choice of 
short skirts, palazzo pants, lean trousers or sweeping floor-length skirts, 
usually of a different fabric. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for a complete outfit start at about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the studio is the only place to purchase her label.

JILL RICHARDS HAS DESIGNS ON MAKING THE MOST OF SECOND CHANCE AT SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like the movie studios with their sequels, Los Angeles actress-turned-designer 
Jill Richards is showing "part two" of her designing career following a brief 
hiatus from the clothing business in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
She says her new collection reflects the same look and taste level that made 
her label de rigueur for ladies-who-lunch. 
</P>
<P>
In the '70s, Nancy Reagan and her friends put Richards on the fashion map when 
they bought her dark "Kitty Foyle" dress with a crisp white collar. 
</P>
<P>
But when the designer sold 75% of her share of Jill Richards Inc. to Robert 
Colman in 1987, the line expanded, the label lost its cachet and the wealthy 
clientele quickly looked elsewhere for their dressy clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Her fall from grace, in Richards' words, was "awful." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Richards secured the rights to her name from Colman for $150,000 last 
year and reentered the designing business under a new company name, JR Couture. 
</P>
<P>
And now she is back in the designer salons of pricey stores like Saks Fifth 
Avenue and Neiman-Marcus as though she never left. 
</P>
<P>
Her latest collection includes the same signature touches: white collars, 
ruffles and her favorite fabric, matte jersey. The silhouette is often simple 
and close to the body. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing this for so long now that I'm very aware of consumer wants," 
she says. "Once ladies hit their 30s, they want sleeves. So I offer draped 
clothes with long sleeves and a V-neck." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Richard's dresses range in price from $450 to $1,250. 
</P>
<P>
"It's taking a while to build that image back," she says. "We'll see what 
happens."

Just when you thought you'd heard the last of Zsa Zsa Gabor's ordeal, here 
comes another volley. To whit: The floral dress she was wearing on the day she 
was arrested is for sale at The Address, a shop in Santa Monica that 
specializes in new and used clothing. The brilliant pink-and-yellow floral 
print, full-skirted dress has a sleeveless black bodice and a matching floral 
print bolero jacket. The asking price for this moment of history is $500. Store 
owner Maureen Clavin says all proceeds will be donated to the Pediatric AIDS 
Foundation. "SCENES" AT TWO MALLS: The Beverly Center has been chosen as one of 
two mall locations for the film "Scenes From a Mall," starring Bette Midler and 
Woody Allen. The comedy/drama will begin shooting at the Bev Center in the 
middle of the month. The other location is the Stamford Town Center in 
Connecticut. The malls were chosen for their architecture, interior design and 
unusual array of stores after a review of 100 shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
SERIOUS SHOPPERS: At 6:45 on Monday morning, fashion mavens began queuing up 
outside Loehmann's Beverly Hills store for its Fashion Preview for Fall '90. 
Few of the 140 in line were there for the free coffee and orange juice; they 
arrived by dawn's early light to receive tickets to the store's famed Back 
Room, where designer fashions marked down as much as 60% awaited them. 
</P>
<P>
BIGGER AND BETTER IN A BABY BLUE BOX: Tiffany and Co. recently heralded its 
new, larger store, scheduled to open in September at Two Rodeo Drive, with a 
posh outdoor breakfast for some of its best customers. Rosemarie Stack, Lee 
Minnelli and Cesar Romero were among those admiring the unabashed baubles on 
display. So extravagant was the gem show that dessert -- petit fours made to 
resemble tiny, Tiffany-blue packages -- prompted one guest to quip, "That looks 
like a ruby ring should be inside." 
</P>
<P>
ON THE FELT AT FRED'S: The pool table at Fred Hayman's Beverly Hills store had 
more actresses than eight balls rolling around it last week. Mimi Rogers (the 
soon-to-be ex-Mrs. Tom Cruise) was seen slithering around the pockets for a 
movie magazine photo shoot, while Melanie Mayron (of "thirtysomething") was 
photographed for a women's magazine. Six members of the Fragrance Council posed 
on the felt for an upcoming London newspaper feature. Eileen Ford sent her 
Super Models of the Year to the store for a video taping to be seen in an 
upcoming television special, and Fred himself was under the lights as he 
wrapped up his "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" segment with Robin Leach. 
Then the Hayman name was seen throughout the nation when Zsa Zsa Gabor wore his 
logo-imprinted togs for her round-trip to the El Segundo jail, where she spent 
last weekend. Gabor arrived in a Hayman T-shirt on Friday and exited in the 
retailer's long-sleeved brilliant yellow sweat shirt on Monday. The Zsaga 
continues.

A Royal Song: Prince Charles gave the Queen Mother a special 90th birthday 
present Thursday -- a concert of specially commissioned music. 
</P>
<P>
The concert by the English Chamber Orchestra, and a recording to be released by 
EMI, will benefit Charles' charity, the Prince's Trust, which helps 
disadvantaged young people. Charles commissioned one of the works by composer 
Patrick Doyle especially for his grandmother. The piece has a series of 
Scottish verses set to music, and was sung by Scottish soprano Marie 
McLaughlin. GREG BRAXTON

Delta Dawn?: Delta Burke has designs on leaving "Designing Women." Burke was 
nominated for an Emmy for her performance as the vain Suzanne on the sitcom, 
but says she has conflicting feelings about it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of wonderful things about it but I have not wanted to be there 
for some time now," she told the Orlando Sentinel. "It is not a good workplace, 
not a good environment. It's so strange, being part of something that's so 
wonderful and so awful at the same time." Burke praised her co-stars but was 
coy when asked about producers Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and Harry Thomason. 
"I'm saving that for the book," she said. "The last two years have been very 
hard. Personally, I lost all my self-esteem.' GREG BRAXTON

Stones to Roll Into Prague: The Rolling Stones will play in Prague, 
Czechoslovakia, for the first time as part of festivities marking the country's 
overthrow of communism. President Vaclav Havel, who led last winter's 
revolution, is a fan of the group, and wants to meet Mick Jagger and other 
members of the band, an aide said Thursday. The concert is scheduled for Aug. 
18, the last stop on the Stones' "Urban Jungle" tour. GREG BRAXTON

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: CONTROVERSIAL ART BUT A CLASSIC STEAK

Above the entrance to Venice's North Beach Bar &amp; Grill, artist Jonathan 
Borofsky's 30-foot-tall unshaven ballerina clown balances en pointe, its right 
leg slowly swaying back and forth. It is controversial art, and now, with the 
opening of the restaurant it announces, it may be Los Angeles' oddest maitre 
d'. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the North Beach, a waterfall made of rusted steel anchors the dining 
room. Displayed like art objects throughout the restaurant are several classic 
Bauer bowls, arranged by size like a family portrait from Baby Bauer to Papa 
Bauer. Between the clown outside and decor within, you might get the feeling 
that you're in for a trendy, multi-ethnic meal. 
</P>
<P>
Then you get the menu: Beefsteak tomato and red onion salad, Caesar salad, New 
York steak, rib eye steak, shrimp cocktail too. The North Beach Bar &amp; Grill 
turns out to be a classic steakhouse at heart. 
</P>
<P>
There are non-steaky things -- oysters on the half-shell, chicken roasted with 
rosemary and garlic, pork chops with applesauce (made at the restaurant and 
thick with pieces of apple), linguine with clams -- but nothing jarring or 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
There's even good service -- the kind you'd expect from an old-fashioned 
steakhouse. No clowning around. 
</P>

MEZZALUNA: HIGH CONCEPT IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talk about high concept. Of course, you have to know that, in Italian, 
mezzaluna means half-moon and also a sort of two-handled crescent-shaped 
chopper, but then it's clear why the walls at Mezzaluna are covered with clever 
paintings of crescent moons in all sorts of whimsical situations. And that 
image on all the dishware -- is it a crescent with a face at either end or a 
chopper with hands grasping it? I see it, I see the concept! 
</P>
<P>
Somehow it comes as no surprise when this stylish Beverly Hills place invites 
you to visit "our locations in New York and Aspen." While you're planning your 
flight, you could spend a couple of hours here at the antique wooden bar and 
check out the great-looking pizza oven, which is faced with tiles that look 
like a scowling face with the oven opening for a mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Or you could try the food. Come to think of it, that might be a good idea 
before you actually reserve a flight. 
</P>
<P>
Mezzaluna basically serves the sort of high-style Italian dishes you'd find in 
other Westside Italian places. Really wonderful goose prosciutto, for instance; 
like a sort of corned beef made from goose, sliced paper-thin and served with 
shaved Parmesan and some subtle truffle-flavored olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
True, the menu refers to it as carpaccio rather than prosciutto, but that's 
probably because the most distinctive thing about this menu is that it lists 
eight versions of carpaccio, to say nothing of a carpaccio of the day. Some 
sound slightly awful, like the one with avocado on it, but in any case the idea 
of paying $12 for a couple of ounces of paper-thin raw beef dribbled with, say, 
extremely mild parsley and anchovy sauce is absurd when you can get that 
wonderful goose carpaccio for the same price. 
</P>
<P>
For even less you can get speck con pere, which is very smoky prosciutto with 
pears; it's kind of like eating prosciutto down-wind of a campfire. There is a 
very nice salad of grilled scallops with frisee lettuce, a simple but savory 
version of veal in tuna-flavored mayonnaise, and very decent grilled 
vegetables. These appetizers are all very good, though I've had one of shrimp 
with white beans that were not al dente but definitely underdone. 
</P>
<P>
The pastas include some real treats such as broad noodles with very 
rich-flavored wild mushrooms. Minigonne integrali -- large tubular pasta, sort 
of like whole wheat ziti -- are surprisingly tasty in their sauce of red 
olives, tomatoes and capers. The peculiarly named linguine sciue sciue are very 
good too: a heap of black linguine in a peppery tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
But not all the pastas are so exciting. One night the pasticcio of the day 
(call it the lasagna of the day; the waiters do), pleasingly layered with 
artichokes and smoked mozzarella, was somewhat mushy and had a disturbing note 
of mint. The rigatoni with old-fashioned meat sauce may be somebody's comfort 
food, a watery tomato sauce with meat and cheese in it, but it isn't mine. 
</P>
<P>
And the short list of meat entrees reinforces the stereotype that Italian 
restaurants only care about appetizers and starches. The grilled Cornish hen is 
unexceptional, and the seafood dishes I've had were disappointing. The 
swordfish with eggplant puree was mushy and overdone; the swordfish in the 
seafood grill was better, but it shared the plate with nondescript shrimp and 
oily, overdone salmon. Both dishes came with the bitterest baby squashes I've 
ever had. 
</P>
<P>
The thin-crust pizzas from the grimacing pizza oven save the place. Pizza 
selvatica is lively with pesto, tomatoes and whole toasted pine nuts. Topped 
with onions, pecorino cheese and a hint of tomato, pizza Pugliese is like a 
streamlined version of a French tarte a l'oignon; it would be a great side dish 
with roast meat. 
</P>
<P>
At dessert time, Mezzaluna makes a tiramisu with some character, 
mascarpone-filled and sprinkled with really a lot of cocoa, and it has a 
chocolate mousse tart (torta di gianduia) with a strong chocolate flavor and a 
mild hazelnut sauce. At least one of the desserts is downright misleadingly 
named, though. The bavarese di melone is a vanilla Bavarian cream with some 
pureed cantaloupe as a sauce, which shares the dish with raspberry and kiwi 
sauces. And I'm convinced that when I ordered grapefruit and vodka ice what I 
got was pear ice. 
</P>
<P>
A good pear ice, though, not rock-hard or over-sweetened. A good concept, 
though not as high as some of the concepts around this place. 
</P>
<P>
 Mezzaluna, 9428 Brighton Way, Beverly Hills, (213) 275-6703. Lunch 11:30 
a.m.-2:30 p.m. Monday-Saturday, dinner 5:30-11 p.m. daily. Full bar. Valet 
parking. American Express, MasterCard, Visa. Dinner for two, food only, 
$48-$77.

'L'ETAT SAUVAGE': A CHAOTIC PORTRAIT OF RACISM IN AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the unnamed African republic that is the setting for "L'Etat Sauvage" (at 
the Monica 4-Plex), sex, racism, corruption and death swarm over the body 
politic like maggots over a strangely tranquil sunbather. 
</P>
<P>
It's a literal hellhole, but one with a little style, perhaps a remnant from 
the French colonials. In a posh hotel, the drunken whites yell racist epithets. 
In modern ministries, the crooked blacks take bribes and boogie to tribal 
dances in the middle of Cabinet meetings. Outside, masses riot mindlessly and 
police wander through the town, piling corpses from the night before into a 
lorry -- and creating a few themselves if the price is right. 
</P>
<P>
One thing seems to preoccupy everybody: interracial sex. Presently, it's 
occurring en flagrante between the stalwart, progressive minister of health, 
Patrice Doumbe (Doura Mane), and his French mistress, Laurence (Marie-Christine 
Barrault): provocatively blond and spiritual-looking. The two seem to share a 
rather joyless, pro forma union, but they drive everyone else in the country 
nuts -- especially the rioting masses, who follow them around like a sullen 
marching band. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Laurence's ex-lover, the vile entrepreneur Gravenoire (Claude 
Brasseur), is driven to insane grimaces, cackles and hideous plots, hatched 
with jolly Modimbo (Baaron), Doumbe's main ministry opponent. Laurence's 
ex-husband, the Candidesque Unesco official Avit (Jacques Dutronc) -- 
understandably hurt at being jilted for both Gravenoire and Doumbe -- wanders 
around in befuddled gloom, trying to decide whether his reactions are simple 
jealousy or actual racism. And Police Superintendent Orlaville (Michel Piccoli) 
-- an unpublished novelist who, with Doumbe, is apparently the only urbane man 
in the country -- cocks a philosophic eye on everyone, while piling more 
corpses into the lorry and cane-whipping his grinning assistant. 
</P>
<P>
In a real-life coincidence, the 12-year-old film arrives here a week after the 
death of co-scenarist Georges Conchon -- also the writer of the Prix Goncourt 
novel on which the script is based. Conchon, legislative secretary in the 
Central African Republic in the early '60s, obviously wrote from experience. 
But his experience is just as obviously colored -- and skewed. Like many recent 
American yuppie romantic comedies, this is a you-and-me-against-the-world-babe 
movie, with the main difference that this world is a writhing snake pit of mad 
mobs, amoral exploiters and dimwitted plutocrats. 
</P>
<P>
Conchon and director/co-writer Francis Girod try to expose racism by the most 
dramatic means possible: a story of miscegenation. But they may be 
unconsciously stumbling into racism themselves. What about the scene where a 
yowling black mob, whipped up by sadistic whites, dog the persecuted couple, 
Laurence and Avit, all the way to the airport? Are the "masses" that pliable? 
Doesn't the once-popular Doumbe have any partisans left? 
</P>
<P>
Girod tries for the hard-edged, iconoclastic lucidity of a Luis Bunuel or a 
Henri-Georges Clouzot, but he lacks their stylistic elegance and withering 
irony. His best known film, "The Infernal Trio," also with Piccoli, seemed 
caught between exposing bourgeois hypocrisy and reveling in its sexy-murderous 
excesses. There is something too pinched, too remote about his vision; his eye 
is cool, but his center of gravity seems missing. 
</P>
<P>
In this film, Piccoli, who helped produce it, is excellent. But Michel Piccoli 
is always excellent; it's almost an axiom. The other actors, quite a talented 
group, seem stranded in a mix of "A Dry White Season" and "Mandingo." It's not 
a pleasure to fault "L'Etat Sauvage" (Times-rated Mature), in many ways a 
brave, nonconformist film. But its own state is confused -- trapped between 
savage iconoclasm, sentimentality and cynicism.

In the murky psychological drama "Twisted Obsession" (at the Century City 
Cineplex Odeon) it's easier to understand why Jeff Goldblum accepted its 
starring role than why the screenwriter he plays so well succumbs to an 
amorphous project seemingly fraught with disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Adapted from British writer-director Christopher Frank's novel "The Mad Monkey" 
by Spanish director Fernando Trueba (in his English-language debut), the 
shadowy set-in-Paris film affords the versatile Goldblum a splendid opportunity 
to play a witty, charming man left vulnerable by his wife's unexpected 
departure and thrust into an emotional crisis which provides him with the 
opportunity to grow up at last. 
</P>
<P>
Under Trueba's subtle, stylish direction Goldblum gives us an engaging, fully 
rounded, finely graded portrayal. The trouble is that the context in which this 
man's maturing process takes place is not nearly so well-developed. 
</P>
<P>
In essence "Twisted Obsession" is a "Lolita" tale, and a very furtive one at 
that, with hints of incest, glimpses of drug-taking and heavy allusions to 
"Peter Pan." Indeed, it is a bit of dialogue from the James Barrie play, in 
which Peter confides to Wendy his fear of growing up, that is the inspiration 
for the film that a British rock video wunderkind (Dexter Fletcher) wants 
Goldblum to write. Goldblum is less than enthused -- until he watches a Cannes 
prize-winning short that Fletcher made featuring his sister (Liza Walker). (We 
only get a quick look, showing Walker's face registering ecstasy.) And when 
Goldblum meets Walker, who plays a girl of 16 who looks closer to 12, he is 
transfixed. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt about it, Walker, making her film debut, is a diminutive beauty, but 
she's been asked to play a sullen type who seems to be in the habit of offering 
sex to every man she meets. She may look like an adolescent but comes on like a 
world-weary streetwalker. 
</P>
<P>
Goldblum may persuade us that his screenwriter becomes swiftly obsessed with 
her, but even though we know little about her and her brother (who also looks 
like an adolescent), she exudes no aura of mystery. It would seem that Prueba 
himself doesn't have that much confidence in Walker's femme fatale aura 
because, although the prime mover, her screen time is kept to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is Miranda Richardson, well-remembered as the Marilyn Monroe lookalike 
heroine of "Dance with a Stranger," who has the truly thankless role as 
Goldblum's Paris-based British agent, a gallant, elegant wheelchair-bound woman 
whose presence is intended to be pivotal but who is reduced to a gamy plot 
contrivance. "Twisted Obsession" is sleek and sophisticated but is finally too 
elusive to be either convincing or satisfying.

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: RHINO RECORDS MAY ISSUE RE-ENGINEERED DAY ALBUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Given the avalanche of "best of" CD reissues in recent years, there's got to be 
a collection of Bobby Day recordings on the market, right? 
</P>
<P>
Don't bet on it. 
</P>
<P>
Day's lively, good-natured "Rockin' Robin" was one of the most celebrated hits 
of the '50s -- a record so infectious that Michael Jackson and his Motown 
mentors turned to it again in 1972 as the second single in the teen-age 
singer's solo career. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Day -- who was born Robert James Bryd in Ft. Worth, Tex. and died 
of cancer last week in Los Angeles at the age of 60 -- was also involved as 
singer and/or songwriter with several other classic R&amp;B/rock singles. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: "Buzz Buzz Buzz" (a Top 10 R&amp;B hit for Day's group the 
Hollywood Flames in 1957), "Little Bitty Pretty One" (a Top 10 pop hit the same 
year for Thurston Harris) and "Over and Over." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is no "best of" Day album available in CD even though 14 of Day's 
recordings -- including his versions of all the above tunes -- were contained 
in a 1984 album that was released on vinyl by Rhino Records, the premier U.S. 
reissue label. 
</P>
<P>
The reason Rhino hasn't reissued the album in CD is a combination of limited 
interest in the original vinyl album and the unavailability of master tapes of 
Day's recording sessions, said James Austin, a member of Rhino's artists and 
repertoire staff. 
</P>
<P>
"When the (vinyl) album was put together, the original master tapes were not 
available so the company had to turn to old 45s (singles) and the quality 
wasn't always the greatest," he said this week. 
</P>
<P>
"When Rhino started getting into CD and the increased sound quality demands, 
the decision was to concentrate on albums where we had good sound quality 
rather than transfer all the albums -- such as the Day album -- to CD." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to improvements in technology, it's now possible to "clean up" vinyl 
recordings considerably, but it's expensive by reissue standards. So, the 
decision to now transfer Day into CD apparently depends on whether there is 
sufficient interest in such an album, Austin said. Sales on the 1984 vinyl 
album were described as slow. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the news reports and tributes about Day following the 
singer-songwriter's death may generate that interest. (Services are scheduled 
for Saturday at the Angelus Funeral Home, 3875 Crenshaw Blvd.) 
</P>
<P>
"If we get enough interest from fans, we would love to put a Bobby Day album in 
CD," Austin said. Anyone interested in encouraging Rhino to move forward with a 
Bobby Day CD can write Austin in care of the company at 2225 Colorado Ave., 
Santa Monica 90404.

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW: TAKE A VACATION FROM ALL THAT ACTION

THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Ready for some classy films as a relief from all this summer's hard-action 
pictures? Just head for your video store. There you'll find two movies which go 
for more emotional responses than the usual quick thrill, nasty scare and cheap 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Driving Miss Daisy" (Warner, $92.95, PG) won four 1989 Academy Awards, 
including Best Picture and Best Actress (Jessica Tandy). It's a quiet, lovely, 
humorous and moving adaptation of a play about the relationship between an 
elderly Southern woman and her black chauffeur (Morgan Freeman) over several 
years. The plot may be a little predictable -- the biggest surprise about 
"Daisy" is that its subtle charms attracted more than $100 million at the box 
office -- but don't let that keep the 99-minute tape off your rental list. The 
fine supporting cast includes Dan Aykroyd and Patti LuPone. 
</P>
<P>
"Enemies -- A Love Story" (Media, $89.98, R) just came out this week, and not 
-- as you may have read elsewhere -- three weeks ago (the release was delayed). 
Like "Daisy," this 1989 Paul Mazursky film also mixes comedy and drama in a 
sophisticated manner as it tells about a Holocaust survivor (Ron Silver) who 
keeps up post-World War II relationships with three women after moving to New 
York. "Enemies," also stars Anjelica Huston, Lena Olin, Margaret Sophie Stein 
and Alan King. TERRY ATKINSON

EMMYS: ABC HOPES PUBLICITY WILL BOOST THE SERIAL'S RATINGS AND THE NETWORK'S 
EFFORTS TO CATCH NBC.

News that ABC's "Twin Peaks" had topped all shows with 14 Emmy nominations and 
that the network had tied NBC in the overall totals with 95 prompted shouts of 
glee in the second-place network's Century City offices Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a bunch of happy folks over here," said Ted Harbert, ABC's executive 
vice president for prime time. "Good news doesn't come in big heaps very often 
in this business, and so when you do get a big heap of good news, we allow 
ourselves, to quote (former ABC Entertainment President) Brandon Stoddard from 
a few years back, 11 minutes to revel in the joy before getting right back to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Right back to it for ABC means spreading the news, especially about "Twin 
Peaks." The quirky soap opera begins eight weeks of reruns Sunday, and Harbert 
said that beginning tonight, the network will be airing promos touting the fact 
that the series claimed more Emmy nominations than any other show this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no direct correlation between Emmy honors and ratings -- in 
fact, some of this season's highest-rated series, including "The Cosby Show," 
"Roseanne" and "America's Funniest Home Videos," were largely ignored by the 
Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences -- history suggests that heavy Emmy 
recognition can provide a boost to some shows. "Hill Street Blues," for 
example, was dismally rated when it first hit the air, but after snagging 21 
nominations and virtually sweeping the major awards in 1981, viewership began 
to grow. It eventually became a ratings success. 
</P>
<P>
Harbert believes that even for a show like "Twin Peaks," which already has been 
blessed with an inordinate amount of media attention, the Emmy nominations 
can't help but lure more viewers into its weird and wild web of intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still a lot of people out there, millions of Americans, who have 
never seen the show," he said. "Maybe they were 'Cheers' fans and they weren't 
available to watch it on Thursdays. For a brand new show -- and remember, 'Twin 
Peaks' has only been on for seven episodes (plus the two-hour pilot) -- this 
kind of recognition is truly helpful. I think you can draw a direct comparison 
to 'Hill Street.' There was a show that started slowly in the ratings and the 
recognition certainly served as a motivation for people to check it out and see 
what all the fuss was about." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will help in bringing new people to the show, particularly since we 
are starting reruns on Sunday," said Mark Frost, executive producer and 
co-creator of "Twin Peaks." "Fourteen Emmy nominations may be just enough 
incentive for some people who have resisted before, or who haven't been around 
at the right time, to make a point of tuning us in." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, ABC was up 10 nominations from last year, while NBC, which has led the 
Emmy race and the ratings race for the last several years, was down eight. 
Harbert said that the tie in total nominations is one of the signals that ABC, 
which narrowed the ratings gap a bit this past season, is closing in on No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great tribute to the quality of the staffs our producers have put 
together," he said, "and proof that if you put on better shows, people will 
notice. . . . It's terrific for morale. Ratings are so hard to get no matter 
how good your shows are, this kind of validation is a good motivator to keep on 
going." 
</P>
<P>
For David Lynch, the director of such eccentric films as "Blue Velvet," "The 
Elephant Man" and "Eraserhead," Thursday was like a dream sequence right out 
"Twin Peaks." In his maiden American television effort, Lynch could become the 
first person to win five Emmys for one show in a single year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty amazing," Lynch said from the set of the show, where he is 
directing an episode for the upcoming season. "Nothing like this has ever 
happened to me before." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch was nominated for producing, directing, writing, song lyrics and 
composing the series' main title theme music with Angelo Badalamenti. (Sam 
Simon, co-executive producer of "The Tracey Ullman Show" and "The Simpsons," 
was also nominated for five Emmys on Thursday, but since two of them are in the 
same category, he could only win five if they tied.) 
</P>
<P>
Lynch's film "Wild at Heart," which opens in theaters Aug. 17, already won the 
grand prize at the Cannes Film Festival this year. He received a best director 
Academy Award nomination for "Blue Velvet," but didn't win.

BUSH EMBARGOES TRADE AND FREEZES IRAQ ASSETS 
</P>

<P>
President Bush embargoed all trade with Iraq and froze the nation's assets in 
the United States on Thursday while refusing to rule out the use of U.S. troops 
to rescue Kuwait from its Iraqi invaders. 
</P>
<P>
The trade embargo bars imports of oil from Iraq, which account for 3% to 4% of 
total U.S. oil supplies, officials said. The move also prohibits Iraq from 
buying U.S. grain and other foodstuffs, which represent the other chief element 
of trade between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's "naked aggression" against Kuwait has created "an emergency in the 
Persian Gulf," Bush said in a speech to the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit 
organization that focuses on global issues. The United States, he said, would 
insist on "immediate and unconditional withdrawal" of Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Bush declared: "We find his 
behavior intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
The trade embargo represents the strongest international response so far to 
Iraq's massive invasion of its small and poorly defended neighbor, but it 
stopped short of the military intervention requested by desperate Kuwait 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Bush Administration sources, the Pentagon stepped up air 
patrols in the Persian Gulf and began moving warships, equipment and supplies 
into the area in a signal to Iraq that the United States would act to halt 
further aggression. 
</P>
<P>
A second executive order signed by the President early Thursday froze Kuwait's 
assets in the United States, a step taken to prevent Iraq from seizing Kuwaiti 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect our friends to stand by us in our time of need," Kuwait's ambassador 
to the United States, Sheik Saud al Nasir al Sabah, said at a Washington news 
conference. "I think the U.S. intervention at this stage is both paramount and 
important." 
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq's ambassador to Washington, Mohammed al Mashat, said Iraq had 
invaded Kuwait in response to a request from the nation's "interim free 
government." He warned the West not to consider "any foreign interference in 
the current events." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's explanation was quickly denounced by the State Department, which said 
Baghdad's claim that its troops moved into Kuwait at that country's request is 
"patent fraud." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the State Department confirmed that invading Iraqi 
troops had rounded up six American oil field workers near the border of Kuwait. 
Their whereabouts is not known. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Bush's refusal to rule out military action, it appeared an unlikely 
option given the strength of Iraq's military, the limited U.S. forces in the 
region and the opposition to U.S. intervention from other countries in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Bush Administration's energies are focused mainly on 
organizing international economic and diplomatic pressure against Iraq. Even 
so, the strongest economic weapon, an international ban on Iraqi oil exports, 
also appears unlikely to be employed. 
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who 
is scheduled to give a speech to the nonprofit Aspen Institute on Sunday, Bush 
said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III will discuss the Persian Gulf 
situation with Soviet officials in Moscow today. 
</P>
<P>
In Ulan Bator, Mongolia, where Baker was on an Asian visit, a Baker spokeswoman 
said that the United States and the Soviet Union plan to issue a joint 
statement later today condemning the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Baker will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on a brief 
refueling stop in Moscow. The meeting was arranged after Baker met with the 
Soviet ambassador to Mongolia, who described the Kremlin's plans for a strong 
Soviet stand on the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, at a news conference in Ulan Bator early today, said there have been no 
reports of U.S casualties in Kuwait and that "the integrity of foreign 
embassies seems to have been preserved so far." 
</P>
<P>
He said the estimate of the number of Iraqi troops in Kuwait varies from 50,000 
to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bush flew to Colorado after meeting early in the morning with his National 
Security Council to discuss the Persian Gulf situation. Originally, the 
President had planned to spend the night in Colorado and return to Washington 
today. Instead, he returned to Washington on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the capital Thursday morning, Bush told reporters at the White 
House that he was "not contemplating" any U.S. military involvement. 
</P>
<P>
But later in the day, at the news conference with Thatcher, Bush moved away 
from that pledge. He said that he had met during the day with top defense 
advisers and "we're not ruling any options out." 
</P>
<P>
The trade embargo imposed by Bush would cut off all commerce with Iraq, except 
news reporting, exports of publications and shipments of emergency relief 
supplies of food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bush, Thatcher has frozen Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets, but she has not 
imposed a trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is highly dependent on oil exports to finance its large armed forces and 
considerable national debt. But Europe and Japan are far more dependent on 
Middle Eastern oil than is the United States, and an international oil embargo 
on Iraq would be painful for many U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
At the joint news conference, Thatcher called for U.N. actions to impose 
additional trade sanctions against Iraq. Asked about an oil embargo, however, 
she stopped short. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to support in the (U.N.) Security Council those measures which 
collectively we can agree to and which collectively we can make effective," she 
said. "Those are the two tests." 
</P>
<P>
Bush spent the day discussing the Iraqi invasion with senior advisers and other 
heads of state, including the heads of Egypt, Yemen and Jordan, Arab leaders 
whom the President described as "friends of the United States." The Arab 
leaders, Bush said, had appealed to him for "restraint" and "a short period of 
time" in which to develop an "Arab solution." 
</P>
<P>
Bush expressed sympathy with the Arab effort but added that "I made clear to 
them that it had gone beyond simply a regional dispute." 
</P>
<P>
Later Thursday, the White House said that Bush had spoken with King Fahd of 
Saudi Arabia for about 30 minutes. The statement said the two leaders agreed 
that the invasion was "unacceptable" and "discussed possible options for 
dealing with the situation." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Washington, Kuwaiti ambassador Saud appealed to the 
United States for military assistance. "My people are suffering," Saud said, 
adding that Kuwait is requesting aid "from everyone who has conscience and fair 
play around this world." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Kuwait's request for U.S. military intervention, he said: "We 
don't stand a chance if we don't get aid from our friends." 
</P>
<P>
Mashat, Baghdad's ambassador to the United States, said in a statement given to 
reporters in Washington that Iraq hoped to withdraw its forces within a few 
days or weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The events currently occurring in Kuwait are an internal affair with which 
Iraq has no relation," Mashat said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States asked Iraq to account for the six missing American 
oil company employees in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Maura Reynolds, Michael Ross and Don Shannon, in 
Washington, and Jim Mann, in Ulan Bator, Mongolia, contributed to this story.

EMMY'S 'PEAKS' SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: DAVID LYNCH'S QUIRKY PRIME-TIME SOAP OPERA LEADS THE PACK WITH 14 
NOMINATIONS AS VOTERS LOOK FOR NETWORK ORIGINALITY. 'L.A. LAW' AND 'TRACEY 
ULLMAN' FOLLOW WITH 13 APIECE.

<P>
In a clear mandate encouraging network originality, TV industry voters on 
Thursday rewarded ABC's quirky, mysterious new soap opera, "Twin Peaks," with 
more nominations than any other show for the 42nd annual nighttime Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
"Twin Peaks," set in a logging town in the Northwest and revolving thus far 
around the murder of a high school homecoming queen, earned 14 nominations. It 
edged out NBC's "L.A. Law," which had 13, as did the defunct Fox series "The 
Tracey Ullman Show" (including four for a special that featured skits from the 
show). "Cheers" and "Murphy Brown" collected 12 apiece and "thirtysomething" 
garnered 11. 
</P>
<P>
The brooding, Gothic-style "Twin Peaks" was nominated for best drama series 
against "China Beach," "thirtysomething," "Quantum Leap" and last year's 
winner, "L.A. Law." Other "Twin Peaks" nominations went to Kyle MacLachlan, who 
plays a baby-faced FBI agent with a passion for good coffee and pies; Piper 
Laurie, whose character is trying to seize control of the local sawmill; and 
Sherilynn Fenn, a sexy classmate of the murdered girl. 
</P>
<P>
"Twin Peaks" co-creator David Lynch could conceivably win five Emmys -- for 
directing, writing, musical lyrics, co-composing the main title theme and as 
co-executive producer of the series with Mark Frost. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fantastic," Lynch said. "I'm going right out to buy a new chain 
saw and a dozen doughnuts." 
</P>
<P>
"We're really thrilled," said "Twin Peaks" co-creator Frost. "This is voted on 
by people who really work in the industry, and I think it shows that people out 
there are looking for something original." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Harbert, ABC's executive vice president of prime time, agreed: "It's a 
clear sign that people are looking for smart, fresh programming." 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the nominations is perfect for "Twin Peaks," which begins its 
reruns Sunday in hopes of building up its sliding ratings in the new season. 
</P>
<P>
The Emmy Awards will be presented on the Fox Broadcasting Co. on Sept. 16 from 
the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, with Martin Starger producing. 
</P>
<P>
While "Twin Peaks" grabbed the lead in the Emmy race, another influential new 
series, Fox's "The Simpsons," managed five nominations despite being 
handicapped by the rules of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. As 
an animated show, the sardonic, weekly half-hour look at family life could not 
be nominated for best comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
The actors who do the voices of the characters -- Homer, Bart, Marge, Lisa and 
the others -- were eligible for nominations but did not get them. A nomination 
for Bart could have posed a delicate problem because a woman, Nancy Cartwright, 
is the voice of the spike-haired brat -- so would she have been nominated for 
best actor or actress? 
</P>
<P>
"The Simpsons," which is going into head-on competition against NBC's ratings 
champ, "The Cosby Show," starting Aug. 23, was nominated as best animated 
program of one hour or less. And one of its shows, "The Simpsons Christmas 
Special" -- which aired before the series formally debuted -- was nominated in 
the same category. 
</P>
<P>
Voters of the TV academy pointedly snubbed ABC's two major ratings hits, 
"America's Funniest Home Videos" and "Roseanne," while nodding approvingly 
toward the network's critically praised series such as "Twin Peaks" and 
"thirtysomething," as well as "China Beach" and "The Wonder Years" (7 
nominations each). 
</P>
<P>
"America's Funniest Home Videos" was totally ignored. Voters also turned up 
their noses for the second consecutive year when it came to "Roseanne" -- 
giving it only two nominations, one for John Goodman as best actor in a comedy 
series as the husband of star Roseanne Barr. 
</P>
<P>
Barr wasn't nominated, but it had nothing to do with the fuss over her 
screeching rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" at a San Diego Padres 
doubleheader last week because voting for the Emmy nominations had already been 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Powered by its big winners, ABC tied for the lead in nominations with NBC, the 
perennial leader. Each had 95, while CBS had 73. 
</P>
<P>
Fox earned 26 nominations, with its 13 for the Ullman program coming in an odd 
fashion -- nine for "The Tracey Ullman Show" and four more for "The Best of the 
Tracey Ullman Show," a special made up of segments from the series. 
</P>
<P>
Cable TV, meanwhile, made its best-ever Emmy showing in its third year in the 
competition, landing 35 nominations -- led by HBO's 20, including seven for the 
special "Billy Crystal: Midnight Train to Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
"We have always had a problem getting people to see our product, and we battled 
that this year by making our tapes available to the TV academy at the 
Wherehouse," said HBO spokesman Richard Licata. "We picked seven shows to give 
out and five of them got major nominations. I know for a fact that it worked." 
</P>
<P>
"China Beach" star Dana Delany, who won last year's Emmy for best actress in a 
drama series, was nominated again and will defend her title against Laurie, 
Jill Eikenberry of "L.A. Law," Angela Lansbury of "Murder, She Wrote" and 
Patricia Wettig of "thirtysomething," who attracted attention this season when 
her character, Nancy Weston, discovered she had ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Also back to defend her Emmy crown as best actress in a comedy series was 
Candice Bergen of "Murphy Brown." Nominated in the same category were Kirstie 
Alley of "Cheers," Betty White of "The Golden Girls," Blair Brown of "The Days 
and Nights of Molly Dodd" and Delta Burke of "Designing Women" -- the first 
female star of that series to be nominated. 
</P>
<P>
There were several eyebrow-raisers in the nominations. Edward Woodward, star of 
"The Equalizer," was nominated as best lead actor in a drama series even though 
his show wasn't on last season. A TV academy spokesman said, however, that 
Woodward was eligible because several original episodes of "The Equalizer" were 
broadcast last summer. The qualifying period ran from June 1, 1989, to May 31, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward will compete against MacLachlan, Peter Falk of "Columbo," Scott Bakula 
of "Quantum Leap" and Robert Loggia of "Mancuso FBI." 
</P>
<P>
Lane Smith, who earned extraordinary reviews for his performance of Richard 
Nixon in ABC's "The Final Days," was ignored, although the film -- which rested 
entirely on his portrayal -- was nominated for best drama special. It concerned 
Nixon's final days as president before resigning over Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheers" star Ted Danson, who has never won an Emmy for the series, was 
nominated again as best actor in a comedy series, along with Goodman, Fred 
Savage of "The Wonder Years," Richard Mulligan of "Empty Nest" and Craig T. 
Nelson of "Coach." 
</P>
<P>
Alex Rocco, who was singled out for praise as the Hollywood agent in the 
canceled CBS show "The Famous Teddy Z," was nominated for best supporting actor 
in a comedy series. Voters also were unaffected by the two-week drunk-driving 
jail stay of "Cheers" performer Kelsey Grammer, who plays Dr. Frasier Crane, 
and they nominated him in the same category. 
</P>
<P>
Top vote-getters in the nominations also included "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation," with nine; "The Golden Girls" and the miniseries "The Kennedys of 
Massachusetts," with eight each; "Sammy Davis Jr.'s 60th Anniversary 
Celebration," with seven; and, tied with six apiece, "Designing Women," 
"Quantum Leap" and the TV movie "Caroline?," a mystery surrounding the identity 
of a young woman.

MORNING REPORT: POP ALBUM CHART; 
</P>
<P>
POISON COULD HURT HAMMER

It looks like Poison could be the group that will knock M.C. Hammer out of the 
top spot on the Billboard magazine pop chart. The band's "Flesh and Blood," 
which steamed up to No. 3 in just three weeks, seems like the only album in the 
Top Five with enough clout to unseat Hammer's "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'em." 
</P>
<P>
But don't count out Wilson Phillips. The trio, with the No. 2 album, has an 
outside chance of taking No. 1, spurred by their new hit single, "Release Me," 
which is No. 17 on the pop chart. 
</P>
<P>
* Attempts to ban records by Luke and 2 Live Crew have proved, of course, to be 
a boon to sales. The Crew's new "Banned in the U.S.A." album debuted at a lofty 
No. 48. After a month, the album's title song is No. 21 on the pop singles 
chart and rising fast.

MERYL STREEP ATTACKS HOLLYWOOD'S GENDER GAP AT SAG CONFERENCE; 
</P>
<P>
FILM INDUSTRY: THE ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS CITES A REPORT THAT SHOWS 
DECREASES IN ROLES FOR WOMEN AND INCOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perennial Academy Award contender Meryl Streep lashed out at the film industry 
this week for downplaying the importance of women both on screen and off and 
said, with tongue only slightly in cheek, that if current trends continue, 
women will be eliminated altogether from movies by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
"The range of roles isn't there (for women) and hasn't been for a long time," 
Streep told a predominantly female audience at Wednesday's opening of the 
Screen Actors Guild's first National Women's Conference at the Ma Maison 
Sofitel Hotel in West Hollywood. "I'm barely able to contain a guffaw when a 
reporter asked me what drew me to a role, as though there is a rainbow of 
well-written female leading roles." 
</P>
<P>
A SAG report released Wednesday showed startling decreases in both women's 
roles and relative income. In 1989, 71% of all roles in feature films and 64% 
of all roles in TV went to men. The report said the combined income of men more 
than doubled that of women ($644 million to $296 million). 
</P>
<P>
Women are at a disadvantage in every age group, the study shows, except 
children under 10. The greatest disparity begins after age 40, where the 
percentage of roles for women drops off dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Streep, the keynote speaker for the conference, called it a career nightmare 
for actresses who reach 40. No matter who they are, she said, they face the 
"age police who want to see your passport or driver's license." 
</P>
<P>
Streep blamed the blockbuster mentality in Hollywood for spawning big-budget 
male action films, at the cost of character-driven films with balanced gender 
roles. Referring back to the days when there were as many female stars as men, 
she said "the crackling wit and stylish verbal surprise which characterized 
films of the past has been crushed under the wheels of blockbusters." 
</P>
<P>
The main culprit for the current disparity is the dependence on foreign 
markets, where male action films are dominant, Streep said. "What we see (in 
the U.S.) is predetermined by what deal makers think will go over well in 
Southeast Asia." 
</P>
<P>
SAG President Barry Gordon told the audience that it's up to labor and the 
public to force a change of thinking among management, but Streep said she 
doesn't "hold out much hope that anything will change." 
</P>
<P>
"There's profit in the old way of doing things," she said. "It's the bottom 
line that drives the dream machine."

LEGS KNOCKED OUT FROM UNDER THEORY ON WHY SNAKES EVOLVED

Snakes wearing tiny oxygen masks while slithering on treadmills at UC Irvine 
apparently have refuted some conventional wisdom about evolution. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists measuring the amount of oxygen consumed by the snakes have concluded 
that, contrary to earlier predictions, limbless locomotion does not conserve 
energy. The research suggests that snakes spend at least as much energy moving 
-- and in some cases, much more -- as legged animals of similar size. 
</P>
<P>
"It's long been an evolutionary puzzle why many vertebrates lost limbs 
entirely," said Bruce Jayne, an evolutionary biologist at UC Irvine and 
co-author of the research in the journal Science. "The suggestion that the loss 
of limbs conveys an energetic advantage for locomotion is not the case at all," 
he explained. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, a Harvard University study found that garter snakes consumed 30% of 
the energy of legged lizards moving the same distance. The preliminary study 
was never published, but was regularly cited in scientific articles and 
textbooks to explain that snakes and certain species of legless salamanders and 
lizards evolved as energy-conserving creatures. 
</P>
<P>
To determine the energy expenditure required for movement, the California 
researchers placed tiny oxygen masks on black racer snakes of the species 
Coluber constrictor. The snakes were then put on custom-designed motorized 
treadmills and the scientists recorded oxygen consumption, speed and endurance 
during two types of locomotion. 
</P>
<P>
During lateral undulation, a snake slithers back and forth along the ground by 
moving its entire body simultaneously at the same speed. But when confronted 
with passage through a narrow tunnel, snakes change their strategy for 
locomotion. Using concertina locomotion, a snake bunches up its body and then 
extends its head forward while the rear portion of the body remains still. Then 
the snake bunches up the front section of its body and pulls its rear section 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
Snakes moving by lateral undulation used virtually the same energy as that of 
limbed lizards of identical size, the researchers noted. Moreover, the energy 
the snakes spent was also similar to that predicted for birds and mammals of 
the same weight. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, snakes moving by concertina locomotion required seven times the 
energy to move the same distance as during lateral undulation, Jayne said. "It 
is the starting and stopping during concertina locomotion that is responsible 
for a higher energetic cost," Jayne said. 
</P>
<P>
Although snakes apparently conserve no energy by slinking along the ground on 
their bellies, other reasons may have influenced the loss of their limbs during 
the course of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
"Without legs, snakes -- because of their cylindrical shape -- can squeeze 
through very small openings. With legs that might be impossible," Jayne said. 
</P>
<P>
C. Richard Taylor, a comparative physiologist at Harvard University who 
conducted the earlier snake studies, said the new research indicates that 
"snakes don't optimize for low energy costs, but instead for the flexibility 
required to move across different terrains." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Full, a locomotion expert at UC Berkeley, has found in his studies of 
millipedes, cockroaches, salamanders and a variety of other animals that an 
animal's size, not its number of legs, or lack of legs, determines the amount 
of energy spent during locomotion.

IT'S THE LEAST THEY COULD DO FOR THE TERNS, NAVY FIGURES 
</P>

Jets roar to a takeoff and scream over the Oakland Bay Bridge, making the 
Alameda Naval Air Station runway seem one of the most unlikely places for a 
nature preserve. 
</P>
<P>
But each summer the air station is transformed into a sort of maximum-security 
bird sanctuary when nesting pairs of California least terns begin to breed in a 
fenced-in some 75 yards from a runway flanked by land-based cannons and armed 
warships. 
</P>
<P>
The California least tern, an endangered species more commonly found in the 
southern part of the state, has no other fertile nesting grounds in Northern 
California. About 100 nesting pairs -- a local record, up from 72 in 1989 -- 
are breeding at the base this year, making the military installation home to 
more than 90% of the least tern population in the north. 
</P>
<P>
"It is critical to keeping them breeding in Northern California," said Laura 
Collins, caretaker at the four-acre Alameda breeding area. "We really don't 
have any big success stories anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
The California least tern has bounced back fairly well since the bird -- a 
cousin to the sea gull, about nine inches from tail to bill -- was included 20 
years ago on the first federal list of endangered species. From a low of about 
300 breeding pairs 30 years ago, the least tern population had increased to 
1,250 pairs by 1989, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
In part because of open spaces and fenced-off beaches on military bases, more 
than half of the least tern population heads to one of the installations at 
breeding time, said Barbara Massey, an ornithologist who studies a least tern 
breeding colony program in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the state's least terns nest on beaches in Southern California -- about 
350 pairs at Camp Pendleton, near Oceanside, another 250 pairs at Venice Beach, 
and about 250 more at Bolsa Chica State Park in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But the Alameda Naval Air Station least terns are not the only ones with a 
penchant for airports. Although the birds naturally seek beach nesting spots, 
they have been known to look elsewhere. About 10 pairs of the birds make their 
nests at the Metropolitan Oakland International Airport, and another small 
group nests between two runways at a San Diego airfield, Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
The sharing of Tarmac and airspace by 200 birds and two reserve squadrons of 
attack jet aircraft -- not to mention four squadrons of helicopters and other 
military planes -- requires some adjustments. For example, Collins sets a 
period in late summer when the Navy shuts down its 3,000-foot main runway and 
directs traffic to another airstrip at the base. 
</P>
<P>
During this period, a Navy spokesman said, fledglings' first short flights 
often land them in the middle of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
"At a certain time during the growing process . . . these least terns have a 
tendency to run out on the runways, and they try to hide on the white and 
yellow paint strips," said Bill Valente, the base's assistant public affairs 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has taken other steps to protect the birds. Navy builders surrounded 
the breeding area with an electrified fence, capable of jolting predators with 
a harmless but discouraging shock from six-volt batteries. This year, the base 
hired federal animal control workers to come in and catch cats and rival birds 
that threaten the least terns and their eggs, Navy spokesman David Kashimba 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For breeding birds, the problems associated with airstrip nesting don't end 
there. At especially noisy times -- when jet pilots practice touch-and-go 
landings, for example -- the birds sometimes do fly away. But they keep coming 
back. Theoretically, steady high noise levels could pose problems for the 
birds, which bring food only to chicks that recognize and return their call. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how they manage to teach their chicks their calls when there's 
the roar of jets everywhere all the time," Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
But the birds manage so well that some of the people who help protect them say 
the air station colony could anchor a Northern California comeback that could 
eventually link up with the southern colonies and spread the birds throughout 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The least tern is one of the success stories, in terms of managing endangered 
species," Collins said.

CUTS MAY SLOW L.A. YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS PLAN 
</P>

The Los Angeles Unified School District may have to slow down its move toward 
year-round schooling because of a $43-million cut in funding by Gov. George 
Deukmejian for such programs, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The action as part of budget vetoes earlier this week will lead to fewer 
12-month schools, more crowded classrooms and possibly even to double sessions 
across the state, California educators also said. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest impact will be in the Los Angeles district, which will lose $26 
million in state support 
</P>
<P>
"The governor has supported year-round in the past but now he's reneging on 
it," said Henry Jones, budget director for the Los Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Katz, assistant state director of finance, said that Deukmejian has not 
changed his mind about saving money on new school construction by having 
schools operate 12 months instead of nine or 10. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor supports the idea of year-round but we have to find a better way 
to structure that program," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
She referred to a system that has provided incentive payments of up to $125 per 
pupil to school districts that change to a year-round calendar. Last year the 
state spent $27 million for this program and another $43.1 million was included 
in the 1990-91 budget approved by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Katz pointed out that Deukmejian retained a second, smaller year-round 
incentive program that pays $25 per pupil to districts that switch to 
year-round. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Harris, who is in charge of educational programs in the state 
Department of Finance, said the Administration wants to change the more 
expensive incentive program because it isn't working. 
</P>
<P>
"We found that people weren't enticed into year-round operations," Harris said. 
"At least 80% of the time, they went on year-round because they had to." 
</P>
<P>
Harris also said the incentive grants, when added to regular financial support, 
meant that "we were putting up 127% of the cost of what it would have cost us 
to build an entirely new school." 
</P>
<P>
However, some school officials have said they are not impressed by that 
argument because the state has fallen at least $6 billion behind in school 
construction needs. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said the Administration has set aside $27 million for a possible new 
year-round incentive plan, if one can be worked out with the Legislature during 
the August session. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Goldberg, president of the Los Angeles Board of Education, said she 
hopes agreement can be reached on a new approach because "we really need that 
money -- we have no other source of support" for the district's ambitious 
year-round plans. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has committed itself to transforming all of its schools to a 
12-month calendar by next July. One hundred and seventy schools, enrolling 
about one-third of the district's 625,000 pupils, now are on the year-round 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said if Los Angeles loses the $26 million in incentive payments it would 
be difficult to keep to the year-round transition schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Payne, year-round consultant for the state Department of Education, said 
loss of the incentive program means fewer districts will change to year-round 
and, as a consequence, overcrowding will be worse. 
</P>
<P>
Payne also said some districts might be forced to have double sessions, which 
generally have not been seen in the state for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The governor also eliminated $2.4 million for Indian education centers from the 
budget, a move that was decried by Assemblyman Robert J. Campbell (D-Richmond). 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said these community-based centers have been successful in reducing 
high school drop-out rates, and increasing college attendance, among American 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"They're really outstanding programs," said Campbell, who visited 10 of the 
centers two years ago. "I'm terribly miffed at the blast the American Indians 
got with these cuts." 
</P>
<P>
Katz agreed that the centers were worthwhile but said, "it would be wonderful 
if we could fund everything but it just wasn't possible this year." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a Sacramento news conference, a coalition of educational groups 
led by State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig announced plans to ask the 
Legislature to override the governor's budget reduction in the cost-of-living 
allowance for school personnel from 4.7% to 3% and the elimination of the 
state's highly-regarded pupil testing program, CAP (California Assessment 
Program).

AS IN LIFE, COUPLE WERE METICULOUS IN DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
SUICIDE: DOUGLAS AND DANA RIDENOUR WERE CAREFUL AND METHODICAL, RELATIVES SAY. 
THEY ENDED THEIR LIVES THE SAME WAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Six pairs of spit-shined cowboy boots were lined up on the floor of Douglas 
Ridenour's closet like soldiers standing at attention. 
</P>
<P>
The office desk that Ridenour and his wife, Dana, shared at a local real estate 
firm was left clean and empty. And their Sunday newspaper subscription had been 
canceled last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
According to those knew them, Douglas and Dana Ridenour planned their deaths in 
the same meticulous and methodical way they lived. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with relatives, co-workers and neighbors on Thursday, a picture 
has emerged of two people who led very private lives marked by a passionate 
devotion to each other and an unusually orderly lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Douglas, 48, and Dana Ridenour, 45, were found early Wednesday 
lying on separate couches in the family room of their Anaheim home. Police 
believe that the couple, killed by shotgun blasts to their heads, died as the 
result of a murder-suicide pact that they had planned for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives and acquaintances have been grappling for answers to why the 
Ridenours, by all accounts a happy and successful couple, would want to end 
their lives -- and in such calculated fashion. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the Ridenours began to put in motion their suicide plan. That month, 
the couple quit their jobs and made a videotape in which they explained that 
they feared growing old and intended to end their lives "very soon." 
</P>
<P>
They subsequently purchased a 12-gauge shotgun, drew up a will, paid for 
cremation services and reportedly withdrew their life savings -- about $50,000. 
They then apparently relaxed at home until they decided the time was right, 
said Ridenour's brother, Ronald. 
</P>
<P>
Their last chore before they died was to arrange for Ronald Ridenour to receive 
the videotape, will and cremation instructions a day after their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"I know most people don't understand," Ronald Ridenour said Thursday. "But he 
was a determined individual. As a brother, I can't emotionally understand it 
either. But I know he believed in what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Ridenour and his father, Floyd Ridenour, described Douglas Ridenour as a 
meticulous, determined man who paid attention to detail in his appearance, his 
work and his home. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Ronald Ridenour said, he would talk about life and death with the 
couple, who both felt strongly that a person has the right to choose the time 
and circumstance of death. He said the couple were not religious and their 
discussions never included the possibility of an afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that there's really not much more to it than the fact that he 
wanted to pick his own time and place," Ronald Ridenour said as he sat in the 
couple's tidy South Dickel Street home on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd Ridenour, who last visited his son in March, 1989, described Douglas 
Ridenour as a "strong-willed boy, and when he made up his mind, there was no 
turning back." 
</P>
<P>
"His mother had a terrible fear of growing old," Floyd Ridenour added. "I guess 
he thought he was getting older too." She died in 1980 at the age of 56 of a 
heart problem, Ridenour said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Ridenour learned of his brother and sister-in-law's suicide plan in a 
15-minute videotape that the couple recorded on April 19 and mailed to Ronald 
Ridenour's Santa Barbara home on Monday morning, the day they are believed to 
have died. 
</P>
<P>
Although the videotape has not been made public, Ronald Ridenour and police say 
that the couple used it as a sort of suicide note, calmly explaining that after 
22 years of marital bliss, they dreaded growing old and were ready to "end it 
all very soon." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd Ridenour said he last talked with his eldest son on July 5, when Douglas 
called him after receiving a birthday check in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
"He bawled me out for sending the money," said Floyd Ridenour, 69, from his 
Troy, Ohio, home. "He told me, 'I don't need any money. I don't need anything.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Ridenour, his brother and his sister, Rebecca, were born in Piqua, 
Ohio. Floyd Ridenour said that his son was an outgoing young man who made 
friends easily and had no problems either in high school or college. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Ridenour enrolled at the University of Dayton in 1961, but dropped out 
a year later to develop his artistic talent at the Dayton Art Institute, said 
Floyd Ridenour. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to Dallas, where he met his future wife, Floyd and Ronald Ridenour 
said. The two moved to California and married in Los Angeles County in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Douglas Ridenour began working as a graphic illustrator for the 
Fullerton-based Industrial Publications and Graphics Inc. He quit that company 
last year, his father said, after he considered purchasing the firm but decided 
it was not feasible. 
</P>
<P>
After a short-lived attempt at selling large-scale earthquake preparedness kits 
to hospitals, schools and businesses, Douglas Ridenour decided to try his hand 
at real estate. 
</P>
<P>
His wife also quit her longtime job as a legal secretary at the Costa Mesa 
branch of the accounting firm Arthur Anderson and Co. and attended real estate 
school with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"They did that so they could be together more," Floyd Ridenour said. 
</P>
<P>
They first landed jobs at the Anaheim branch of Coldwell Banker and moved to 
Lincoln Realty in Orange in November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
When they quit their jobs at Lincoln in April, they told their employer that 
they needed a four-month hiatus to travel. But apparently they spent their last 
months together at the single-story home they bought two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't go anywhere in the sense that they took a vacation," Ronald 
Ridenour said. 
</P>
<P>
Between April and Monday, neighbors noticed nothing out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
They often saw the couple, always dressed impeccably, drive by in their white 
1969 Corvette or 1985 yellow Cadillac. Occasionally Douglas or Dana was seen 
walking outside to pick a newspaper off the well-kept yard or to turn on the 
sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
Since moving into the central Anaheim neighborhood, the Ridenours preferred 
their privacy, neighbors said. Shortly after they moved in, next-door neighbor 
Angie Rossol said, they installed a high, blue awning around their back yard to 
ensure their seclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"I never met more private people," Rossol said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Ridenours appeared aloof to neighbors, their co-workers at Lincoln 
found them to be personable and hard-working, quickly establishing a track 
record by selling several high-priced homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just baffled. They were an upbeat, very loving couple, and they were on 
target to do well," said Judy Dillavou, a real estate broker who owns Lincoln 
with her husband, Dean. "We had great expectations for them."

BRITISH REGIMENTS BATTLE TO SURVIVE DEEP BUDGET CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For centuries, the regiment has been the keystone of the British army. 
Generations of soldiers have fought not just for queen (or king) and country 
but for regimental honor as well. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the American army regiment, identified by a mundane number with random 
assignment of personnel, the British army regiment has always had a descriptive 
name, a selection process and its own identity, and most are steeped in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
But today, some regiments are threatened with extinction by the reduced British 
defense budget, following the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
With army personnel due to be whittled down by one-third, defense specialists 
say it is more than likely that some regiments will have to be disbanded or 
combined with others. 
</P>
<P>
The stiff-upper-lip units will not go without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"The best regiments have very powerful lobbyists working for them in 
Parliament, in Whitehall and in high business circles," observed one defense 
specialist. "They will fight tooth and claw to keep their old regiments from 
being disbanded." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more recently formed regiments are considered top-notch militarily 
and probably won't be affected by budget cuts. These include the Parachute 
Regiment, which won two Victoria Crosses in the Falklands War, and the 
anti-terrorist, all-purpose Special Air Service Regiment (SAS). 
</P>
<P>
Because regiments have anywhere from one to three battalions operational, one 
way to retain many regimental structures would be to pare down extra 
battalions. 
</P>
<P>
The last major threat to the regiments, a military reorganization in the late 
1960s, led to intense lobbying for individual units. The venerable Scottish 
Argyll regiment, for example, managed to survive by combining with another 
regiment as the Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders. 
</P>
<P>
The history of the regiments parallels much of the history of the nation. The 
Life Guards date to 1659, when they were formed to support King Charles II. The 
Blues, whose horses can be seen on guard at London's Whitehall, were organized 
a year later and won their first battle honors at Tangier in 1662. 
</P>
<P>
Several regiments, including the Foot Guards, fought at the Battle of Waterloo 
and still toast the victory over gleaming regimental silver at formal mess 
evenings. Royal Family members are honorary colonels-in-chief of select 
regiments. 
</P>
<P>
Each infantry and cavalry regiment has its own special uniform, with plumes or 
braid or spurs -- and often with Saville Row tailoring. In civilian dress, the 
regimental tie is a distinctive item of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
There are 52 serving cavalry and infantry regiments plus four Gurkhas units. 
But because of their traditions and attractions, some are considered more 
fashionable -- the less grand meanly called "fish-and-chip" regiments. 
</P>
<P>
Those standing highest in the social scale are generally considered to be the 
Horse Guards, the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals -- with their shining 
helmets and breastplates -- and the Foot Guards, the Grenadiers, Coldstreams, 
Scots, Irish and Welsh. 
</P>

Military experts maintain that the British army regiment is not simply a 
fancy-dress organization but rather an efficient way of life for soldiers, who 
are brought into it as recruits and often spend their entire careers there. 
</P>
<P>
"The British regimental system encourages personal loyalty, dedication and 
esprit de corps," said one military commentator here. "It would be a great pity 
to see a fine regiment disbanded." 
</P>
<P>
Or as British author Duff Hart-Davis put it: "I served in the Coldstream Guards 
for less than two years, almost 35 years ago. But if ever I learn that the 
regiment is to be disbanded or even to lose one of its two battalions, I shall 
reckon it a personal as well as a national disaster."

CIA MISREAD SOVIET ECONOMY;

AGENCY'S DEPENDENCE ON COMPUTER MODELS -- INSTEAD OF OBSERVATION -- PRODUCED 
RESULTS THAT WERE WILDLY ASKEW.

<TEXT>
<P>
For most of the past four decades, the CIA has been badly overestimating the 
performance -- and prospects -- of the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons may provide critical lessons for the future. In a nutshell, critics 
say, the CIA was led astray by the American bent for high technology: It relied 
too heavily on computer models and not enough on old-fashioned, first-hand 
observation and reporting. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, for example, the CIA said the Soviet economy was already 
half as big as America's and growing more than twice as fast. In reality, the 
Soviets were beginning a decline that has led them to the brink of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"Common sense was just not applied," a senior defense official says. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, many of America's allies trusted more to first-hand observation 
and their experts' own judgments. On that basis, analysts in Sweden and Britain 
have long regarded the Soviet Union as essentially a Third World economy -- an 
"Upper Volta with missiles." But their views were dismissed in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Background 
</P>
<P>
The idea of using econometric models for intelligence estimates -- which 
paralleled a general trend in economics at the time -- was the brainchild of 
Harvard University's premier Soviet economist, Abram Bergson, who touted the 
technique as more precise than the old system of sending in agents. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble was that using computer models forced the CIA to rely on Soviet 
statistics, which were known to be flawed -- or sometimes even fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence analysts tried to factor out the flaws in Moscow's data, but the 
Soviet statistics were so inflated that they were almost useless. 
</P>
<P>
CIA officials apparently could not fully comprehend the lengths to which Soviet 
officials went to pump up the numbers. According to one horror story that 
eventually emerged, finished ball bearings, instead of being used in the 
manufacture of new machinery, were sent back to Russian steel mills, melted 
down and re-cast, thereby boosting the mills' production figures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Consequences 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of the U.S. intelligence community's preoccupation with 
scientific analysis may have been enormous. In hindsight, the early CIA figures 
gave undue credence to Nikita Khrushchev's table-thumping boast in 1961 that 
the Soviet Union would "bury" the United States by the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"We might not have turned ourselves into a debtor nation," says Sen. Daniel P. 
Moynihan (D-N.Y.), or gone into Vietnam or embarked on the huge military 
buildup under then-President Ronald Reagan, if U.S. leaders had realized that 
the Soviets could not sustain their aggressive stance. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, not everyone is convinced of that. 
</P>
<P>
Although the CIA chronically exaggerated the Soviets' economic performance, it 
also underestimated the amount going into military spending, which some experts 
argue canceled out the errors on the overall economy. 
</P>
<P>
Paul H. Nitze, who has served almost every President since Franklin D. 
Roosevelt, does not believe that the CIA figures on Soviet defense budgets had 
much effect. "After all," Nitze says, "we were counting Soviet missiles and 
tanks with our satellites, and then responding to the threat-capabilities of 
those weapons, not to how much it cost to produce them." 
</P>
<P>
All that is argument about the past. What remains disturbingly true today is 
that U.S. intelligence methods used to measure the economic strength of a 
dangerous rival were badly flawed and that little has been done to improve the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
In Senate testimony recently, CIA officials recognized that the agency has a 
problem, but they said they had made no major reforms yet.

Communist guerrillas on Thursday freed an American Peace Corps volunteer and a 
Japanese aid worker but warned Washington and Tokyo to stay out of the 
Philippine insurgency or more of their citizens would be seized. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Swanson, 26, of Cheyenne, Wyo., and Japanese aid worker Fumio Mizuno, 
36, were released separately by the Communist New People's Army during a 
three-day truce on the central island of Negros. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy it's over. I'm OK, I'm OK," Swanson said before being whisked away 
by U.S. officials, who said he would be taken to Manila for a medical checkup. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson was taken from his home in the Negros highlands June 13, shortly before 
the United States ordered the withdrawal of all 261 Peace Corps volunteers from 
the Philippines because of murder and kidnap threats by the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Mizuno, who was abducted May 29 while visiting a project funded by a private 
Japanese aid group, wept in the arms of his wife and two daughters after he was 
freed. 
</P>
<P>
After the pair's release, the NPA accused U.S. and Japanese aid organizations 
of helping the Philippine government in its fight to rout the rebels, who have 
been waging a 21-year insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, who met briefly with Swanson's parents when he visited Cheyenne 
on July 20, called Thursday morning with his best wishes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In Cheyenne, Swanson's father, Leonard, said, "It's just wonderful. I'd like to 
thank everybody for getting him released." 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Lynn, said she was planning to bake a rhubarb pie and stock up on 
steaks to celebrate her son's homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be well-fed when he gets home, I can guarantee that," she said.

U.S. BACKS SOVIET MARKET ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
REFORMS: AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN WILL HEAD FOR MOSCOW NEXT MONTH TO AID GORBACHEV.

<P>
The United States, responding to Soviet requests for economic assistance, 
agreed Thursday to bring dozens of top American businessmen to Moscow next 
month to consult on this country's transition to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached between U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, will commit the Bush 
Administration and the U.S. business establishment to ensuring the success of 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, meeting Baker in the Siberian city of Irkutsk, discussed the 
Soviet Union's deepening economic crisis and what assistance the United States 
could provide as Gorbachev transforms the state-owned, centrally planned, 
bureaucratically managed economy into one based on entrepreneurship and the 
market forces of supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
Vitaly I. Churkin, a Shevardnadze aide, said that the Soviet Union is accepting 
Bush's offer of assistance, made last December when he met Gorbachev at Malta, 
and hopes that extensive consultations will result from the next 
Baker-Shevardnadze meeting, planned for Moscow in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
Robert A. Mosbacher, the secretary of commerce, will bring a delegation of 
leading American businessmen to Moscow for that meeting, which will coincide 
with the annual session of the Soviet-American Trade and Economic Commission. 
Gorbachev will meet with the group for a strategy session on economic reform 
and increased trade. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in renewing his offer of assistance, said recently that the United States 
is prepared to provide economic advice, to expand technical cooperation and to 
foster increased trade to underwrite the Soviet Union's economic reforms, but 
that the United States cannot provide direct economic assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Churkin said that Shevardnadze had outlined a series of areas where the United 
States could help, starting with government-to-government agreements to provide 
the framework for increased trade but continuing into extensive cooperation 
between U.S. and Soviet enterprises as a market economy develops here. Baker 
had made detailed proposals when he met with Shevardnadze last month in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. technical assistance might help the Soviet Union solve such problems as 
getting food to the market; more than a quarter of Soviet agricultural produce 
rots before it gets to consumers because of inadequate transport and storage 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
American specialists might also advise on the development of a commercial 
banking system, the formation of equity markets to raise capital and modern 
industrial management. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments at the Irkutsk meeting, Baker and Shevardnadze 
established a new channel for quick resolution of issues in the negotiations to 
reduce the two countries' strategic arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
As the negotiators in Geneva proceed through the scores of outstanding 
questions in drafting a strategic arms reduction treaty for signature by the 
end of this year, they will now put those requiring political decisions to the 
ministers' deputies, rather than wait for the ministers' next meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"This new channel does not mean new difficulties," Churkin said. "The principal 
points of the treaty were agreed in Washington in June. The final preparations 
of the treaty are now under way, but there are enormous technical difficulties. 
The point is that the two sides are determined to finalize this treaty as soon 
as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze formally advised Baker in Irkutsk that the Soviet Union would 
complete its deployment of mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles in 1991 
and thus would halt production of the weapons. Churkin said this should make it 
easier to agree on rules for verifying compliance with the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed ways to resolve the principal remaining issue 
-- the deployment of warplanes -- in the Vienna negotiations on reducing 
conventional forces in Europe and agreed to consult with their allies in NATO 
(North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and the Warsaw Pact to see if these could 
be included in a treaty to be signed at an all-European summit in Paris in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze agreed on a timetable for the preparation of a new 
Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting to be held in Moscow before the end of the year 
with the strategic arms control agreement as its centerpiece, Churkin said. 
</P>
<P>
That will propel the two countries to make a number of key decisions in the 
next four or five months on how their relationship will develop, according to 
Churkin. 
</P>
<P>
The principal focus of the Irkutsk meetings had been regional conflicts, 
particularly those in Asia -- the Korean Peninsula, Cambodia and Afghanistan -- 
as well as the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Churkin said the result was 
one of "narrowing differences" but that differences remained. 
</P>
<P>
"Each time the ministers discuss this (Afghan) issue, they find new common 
ground," Churkin said of the continuing Afghanistan civil war, in which Moscow 
and Washington supporting opposing sides. "Both agree elections should be held, 
that the United Nations should play an active role in the settlement and that 
the process should be under international control."

IRAQI INVASION CONDEMNED BY U.N. COUNCIL

The U.N. Security Council adopted a strong resolution Thursday condemning 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, with several diplomats expressing alarm at what they 
considered a blatant danger to peace and security in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and several council members said 
everyone was waiting to see what action the Arab League, meeting in Cairo, 
would take. 
</P>
<P>
However, the emergency Arab League session failed to publicly condemn the 
invasion and adjourned its meeting for 24 hours as Arab leaders held urgent 
consultations on how to handle the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
One senior diplomat on the Security Council said he thought there might be some 
further action at the United Nations if Iraq fails to move to withdraw its 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people will just sit back and do nothing," he told reporters. 
"This is not one of those cases where the council passes a resolution and then 
shrugs its shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
Other diplomats said it is highly unlikely that the council would resort to 
measures such as economic sanctions. But several said the United Nations would 
be used as a forum to persuade individual nations to pressure Iraq further. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy U.N. Ambassador Sabah Talat Kadrat told the council early Thursday 
that his country's forces would be withdrawn as soon as order had been 
restored, which he said he hoped would take days or weeks at most. 
</P>
<P>
The council's resolution condemned the invasion and demanded that "Iraq 
withdraw immediately and unconditionally all its forces" to their Aug. 1 
positions." 
</P>
<P>
It also called on Iraq and Kuwait to begin immediately intensive negotiations 
for a resolution of their differences and said the council will meet again as 
necessary to consider further steps to ensure compliance with its resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The council acted under articles 39 and 40 of the U.N. Charter, dealing with 
breaches of the peace. The same section of the Charter provides for possible 
sanction in the event of noncompliance. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 council members, 14 supported the resolution. Only Yemen, the sole 
Arab member of the council, said it could not participate in the vote. 
</P>

U.S. TRADE EMBARGO EXPECTED TO HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON IRAQ; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: ANALYSTS SAY WASHINGTON CANNOT PUSH FOR WORLDWIDE SANCTIONS WITHOUT 
RISKING A RECESSION AT HOME.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The broad trade embargo that President Bush imposed on Iraq is not expected to 
have a major impact on that country's economy, analysts said Thursday, and 
Washington cannot push for worldwide sanctions without risking a recession at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, analysts said that Iraq's heavy economic dependence on selling oil 
abroad should make it highly vulnerable to the kind of economic sanctions that 
Bush -- and other American Presidents -- historically have relied upon to 
achieve their foreign policy goals. 
</P>
<P>
But in reality, economists said, Bush would find it practically impossible to 
push through economic sanctions severe enough to hurt Iraq without risking 
serious damage to the American economy -- perhaps even pushing it into a deep 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
Although broadening the economic embargo to involve other Western nations as 
well might hurt Iraq significantly, it also could easily backfire on the United 
States and any other industrial powers that might take part in such an effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid the U.S. is trapped between a rock and a hard place," said Alan 
Stoga, international economist for Kissinger Associates, the New York 
consulting firm run by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
"Unilateral sanctions won't have very much impact at all, but the risk of a 
multilateral response to Iraq is that the potential effect on oil prices would 
be so severe as to do more harm than good," Stoga said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it were effective in cutting off Iraq's oil exports, a worldwide 
boycott of petroleum from Iraq and Kuwait would risk driving the price of oil 
up to as much as $40 to $45 a barrel and quickly tipping the already-sluggish 
U.S. economy into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The two countries together export more than 4 million barrels of oil each day. 
</P>
<P>
The only way out of this dilemma, Stoga suggested, would be for the United 
States to provide Saudi Arabia with military protection against Iraq, if the 
Saudis agreed to pump enough additional oil to make up for the embargoed 
petroleum from Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Such a deal, Stoga and other experts conceded, is highly unlikely any time 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many analysts believe that Iraq may well get away with its sudden 
invasion of Kuwait, taking over one of the richest countries in the world and 
gaining effective control of almost 100 billion barrels of additional oil 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has moved to correct its own strategic position in the gulf in what 
amounts to a militarily imposed business takeover," said Patrick Connolly, a 
senior consultant at Cambridge Energy Associates in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein "has almost doubled his reserves and productive 
capacity overnight, wiped out as much as $35 billion in financial obligations 
overnight and essentially solved his revenue problems," Connolly said. He 
added: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody is in any position to do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
In imposing U.S. economic sanctions against Iraq, the Bush Administration froze 
all Iraqi and Kuwaiti government assets in the United States and in overseas 
branches of U.S. firms. The White House also banned virtually all trade with 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
But independent analysts dismissed the U.S. actions -- which are similar to 
those that the United States imposed on Libya several years ago for that 
country's terrorist activities -- as relatively ineffective by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has almost no direct investments in the United States and relatively 
little trade with this country. The United States exported only about $1.2 
billion worth of goods to Iraq last year, the vast bulk of it farm commodities. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the sanctions could have a significant effect on U.S. rice 
growers, however. Iraq is the largest export market for American rice, 
accounting for more than $116 million in sales -- or roughly 23% of all U.S. 
rice shipments abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The United States imports about $2.4 billion in goods from Iraq, almost all of 
it petroleum and oil products -- making Iraq the sixth-largest oil supplier to 
America. In the absence of a worldwide embargo, however, the U.S. sanctions are 
expected to make little difference. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is likely to find another market elsewhere for its goods. At the same 
time, analysts said that American oil companies should have little trouble 
replacing the supplies from Iraq that the embargo is cutting off. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq lost no time in retaliating against the American sanctions, halting its 
debt payments to the United States, the Qatari news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Institute for International Finance, Iraq owes about $22 
billion to Western banks and governments and roughly $6 billion to the Soviet 
Union and East European nations. 
</P>
<P>
But only about $1.6 billion of this total is actually owed to U.S. banks, and 
most of that is due the Atlanta branch of BNL, an Italian bank that extended an 
unauthorized loan to Iraq that was not discovered until late last year. 
</P>
<P>
The BNL branch secretly agreed to lend Iraq $1.5 billion, but it only disbursed 
about $1 billion of that money, leaving another $500 million that was subject 
to Thursday's freeze. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. effort to protect Kuwaiti assets abroad from takeover by Iraq may 
prove more successful, but is expected to set off a prolonged legal struggle 
between the new puppet government and Kuwait's royal family. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has an estimated $100 billion in overseas investments, analysts said -- 
about one-third in U.S. stocks, bonds, real estate and holdings in energy 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and France took similar steps Thursday to freeze Kuwaiti assets, in a 
move that British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said was designed "to prevent 
a puppet regime in Kuwait from transferring" them elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In hopes that Kuwait can eventually escape from under Iraq's thumb, McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. said Thursday that it would continue production on a $1.8-billion 
Kuwaiti order for 40 fighter jets despite the uncertainties stemming from 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Whitney, a spokesman at McDonnell's St. Louis headquarters, said that the 
F/A-18 jets, scheduled for delivery starting in January, 1992, are in the early 
stages of production. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell and its major F/A-18 suppliers, including the Los Angeles-based 
Northrop Corp., will continue to work on the jets as if nothing had changed, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney said that the U.S. government, which controls all sales of military 
hardware to foreign governments, has not sought to stop continued sales to 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But analyst Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Securities told Reuters news agency 
that the sale ultimately could be in jeopardy if the new Kuwaiti government 
that emerges from the conflict is pro-Iraqi or otherwise proves unfriendly to 
the United States.

"The U.S. wouldn't want (the jets) to fall into the hands of Iraq," Nisbet 
said. "The assumption is that by 1992, the government of Kuwait will be 
independent again." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury officials were swamped Thursday by hundreds of 
telephone calls from business executives seeking to learn more about the impact 
of the new sanctions against Iraq. It was not immediately clear how the trade 
ban would affect goods already in transit. 
</P>
<P>
"We have crisis teams set up to deal with that," one official said. "That's a 
policy question, and I think what we need to do is weigh the practicalities. It 
is a fairly full and complete economic and trade embargo."

FAMILY'S 200-YEAR GRIP ON GOVERNMENT BROKEN 
</P>

<P>
For more than 200 years, a single family has dominated the government of 
Kuwait, the tiny Arab sheikdom at the head of the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
That unbroken hegemony reflects the political flexibility of the family, the 
Sabahs, one of the longest-ruling of all the Arab dynasties. Legend even says 
that it was precisely their superior diplomatic skills that earned the original 
Sabah settlers the right -- in bargaining with other families -- to control the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
It also reflects the tenacity of a family that eventually built one small port 
city into an oil kingdom with one of the highest per capita incomes in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
From its beginning, Kuwait was built on commerce -- a foundation that was only 
strengthened when rich deposits of oil were discovered after World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Before the era of oil, the region hardly seemed a prize. Flat, empty desert 
land, it is so dry that today residents are forced to depend on purified 
seawater. But when three families of the Bani Utub tribe arrived in the region 
in the mid-18th Century, it was already a crossroads for traders from Syria, 
Iraq and Persia. Seagoing European nations also called at the port of Kuwait. 
The families decided to take advantage of the trading opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The original three families founded an unusual state, based on a division of 
labor among them. In a pact, they agreed to give one family control of commerce 
and the second seafaring trades. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabahs, considered to be the most diplomatic of the families, were granted 
administration of the state -- power they held in unbroken succession until 
Thursday, when Iraqi troops overran the country and sent the emir fleeing to 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
This division of labor worked well for many years. The Sabahs, dependent on the 
merchant families for income, were careful not to alienate them. They also had 
good relations with the nomads. 
</P>
<P>
But all of that began to change with the discovery of oil in the early 1930s. 
Oil exports provided the ruling family with an independent -- and seemingly 
unlimited -- source of income. The Sabahs found that they no longer needed to 
court the merchants and the desert nomads, and began appointing family members 
to jobs throughout the government. 
</P>
<P>
As they turned inward, the Sabahs also made themselves more dependent on the 
outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its geographical vulnerability, Kuwaiti foreign policy has always 
tended to play competing powers against each other, including the Soviet Union 
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Domestically, the country has experienced increased tension between different 
parts of Kuwaiti society. The oil boom attracted thousands of new immigrants, 
who now make up 60% of the population despite the fact that they have no legal 
rights under the Kuwaiti constitution. Reflecting the country's conservative 
brand of Sunni Islam, women also are not allowed to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Since last December, a pro-democracy movement has been pressing the Sabahs for 
change. Dissidents won a compromise this spring when the family allowed 
elections for a new National Council, a body that began meeting this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, for all their faults and despite rising demands for change, the 
Sabahs retained surprising popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"If the emir were to return tomorrow," predicted Jill Crystal, a specialist in 
Kuwaiti politics, "he would have no trouble regaining control over the 
country."

ARAB AIDES AGREE -- TO MEET AGAIN; 
</P>

DIPLOMACY: BRAZEN INVASION BRINGS A DILEMMA TO REGION. CONCERTED ACTION IS SEEN 
AS UNLIKELY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers huddled in emergency session throughout the day Thursday 
at a plush hotel next to the Nile, debating how to respond to Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein's brazen invasion of Kuwait earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
They broke for lunch. They phoned home. They plunged in again at dusk, calling 
for more coffee. But by mid-evening, the only thing they had agreed on was to 
meet again today. 
</P>
<P>
Even a prominent Egyptian diplomat was embarrassed. "The Arab world," he 
sighed. "They're all walking around this afternoon the same way they were this 
morning. 'What to be done? What to be done?' " 
</P>
<P>
Such is the Arab world's dilemma in confronting the brash Iraqi president who 
has emerged at once as its most prominent leader and its most savage dictator, 
the new standard-bearer for Arab unity and the single greatest threat to his 
neighbors anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Even Saudi Arabia, whose famed multibillion-dollar defense budget has built one 
of the most technologically sophisticated arsenals in the region, appears to 
have found itself powerless to stop Iraq's decisive march into Kuwait. It is a 
march in defiance of regional cooperation pacts and Hussein's recent pledge to 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, as recently as a few days ago, that he would 
not resort to force. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a thumb in Mubarak's eye, and he knows it," one Western diplomat 
said. "At this point, I don't think any one state is able to counteract the 
Iraqis, and it just doesn't seem likely that there will be any concerted 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait pleaded with the ministers to adopt a resolution condemning the invasion 
and also sought military intervention from the 21-nation Arab League and from 
its neighbors on the Gulf Cooperation Council, a coalition of Persian Gulf 
states whose primarily economic union also included a mutual defense pact. 
</P>
<P>
But sources close to the talks said the ministers found themselves unable even 
to agree to condemn the invasion, in large part because of opposition from two 
staunch Iraqi allies, Yemen and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Gulf 
Cooperation Council members -- Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and 
the United Arab Emirates -- met earlier in the day and broke up without issuing 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president held intense contacts with Arab leaders throughout the 
region Thursday, proposing an emergency Arab League summit in Cairo as early as 
the next few days. But most attention focused quietly on the Saudis, who have 
the most muscle to apply against Iraq -- and the most to lose if it doesn't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's vast oil wealth -- almost 40% of it annually spent on defense -- 
has enabled it to amass one of the most sophisticated weapons networks in the 
Middle East. Its 65,700-member armed forces is by far the largest among the 
Gulf Cooperation Council countries; its air force is equipped with sleek F-15 
and F-53 fighter jets; the Saudis operate U.S.-supplied AWACS airborne early 
warning systems and sport 550 main battle tanks. 
</P>
<P>
But the Iraqis have 1 million troops under arms, finely honed from Iraq's 
recent eight-year-long war with Iran. They are prepared to deploy up to 5,500 
tanks and 513 combat aircraft, including fairly advanced Soviet-made MIG-23s 
and the French-built Mirage F-1s. 
</P>
<P>
"The quick answer is, they (the Saudis) are not a powerful force. It's a very 
expensive force, a very sophisticated force in terms of aircraft, but there's 
not all that much there," said Dr. Hans Binnendijk of London's International 
Institute for Strategic Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia finds itself in the uncomfortable position of being bound to 
defend Kuwait under a clause of the Gulf Cooperation Council pact, yet vastly 
underequipped to do so -- and suddenly wary that its historic political 
influence within the region may be on the wane, a variety of diplomats and 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing an Arab counterstrike from Saudi soil could have dangerous 
repercussions if the strike fails. And the Saudis are equally wary of seeking 
too much assistance from the United States because -- with their own regime 
occasionally buffeted mildly by internal dissent -- they don't want to appear 
to be, in the words of one analyst, "too dependent on the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
"They're just helpless. They're a population of 7 or 8 million people with lots 
of modern equipment. They've never been tested militarily. And they're up 
against a major machine," one longtime Middle East specialist said. The 
specialist continued: 
</P>
<P>
"Very often, their tactics have been to suborn people through money. But with 
Saddam Hussein, they won't be able to buy him now. He owes them over $30 
billion -- with what's happened in Kuwait, how are they going to ask him to pay 
it back? I think their concern is going to be that he's now the big guy on the 
block. They're going to have to jump in oil pricing, foreign policy. They must 
be very, very worried." 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials are worried -- and angry -- about the same thing, 
complaining privately that Hussein has within a single day undone the effects 
of years of careful diplomacy on the part of the Egyptians to begin restoring 
intra-Arab ties. 
</P>
<P>
"He read the changes in the world between the Russians and the Americans as 
leaving the Middle East as a stage for local predators to take over, and he 
took over," one Egyptian official complained. "His methodology has been the 
methodology of the new bully around the country who neutralized everybody and 
scored." 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak reportedly took the invasion hard, regarding it as a personal affront. 
And while the Egyptian government carefully avoided any direct comment in 
advance of the final Arab League deliberations, Cairo's government-backed 
papers early today were less circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
"This is truly a black day in the history of the Arabs," wrote the daily Al 
Ahram, "because whatever the reason and rationalizations, no one can accept 
that one Arab will kill his brother, or will carry arms against his Arab-Muslim 
brother. . . . It brings us back to the primeval days of ignorance."

REP. FLAKE ACCUSED OF BILKING CHURCH PROJECT

U.S. Rep. Floyd H. Flake was indicted Thursday for conspiracy, fraud and tax 
evasion in the alleged embezzlement of funds from a federally subsidized senior 
citizens housing project run by his church. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, announced by U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Maloney, listed 17 counts against the New York Democrat and nine against 
his wife, described as the bookkeeper for the operation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his congressional duties, Flake is the pastor of the 
156-year-old Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in Queens. The church 
built and operates the 300-unit senior-citizen facility. 
</P>
<P>
Maloney said at a news conference that Flake stole about $75,000 in 
transportation funds from the Allen Senior Citizens Apartments from 1983 to 
1987, and diverted another $66,000 in church funds to his own use from 1983 to 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The allegedly misappropriated money was not reported by Flake on federal income 
tax returns, Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
The church built the facility with a $10-million grant from the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. HUD also provides $100,000 a month in subsidies 
for operations, Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
Flake, in a statement, said he had cooperated fully with the government in an 
18-month investigation. He said he and his wife, Margarett, are innocent. 
</P>
<P>
"Our abiding belief in God and in the American system of justice reassures us 
that, despite the awful price, justice will triumph and we will be vindicated 
at trial," Flake said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all 17 counts, Flake could be sentenced to 87 years in prison 
and fined up to $3.95 million. His wife could face penalties of 55 years in 
prison.

8TH NAVIGATION SATELLITE ORBITED TO PINPOINT U.S. MILITARY UNITS

<P>
A navigation satellite boosted into orbit by a Delta rocket Thursday is the 
latest in a series of spacecraft capable of pinpointing the location of U.S. 
military units to within 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The unmanned rocket thundered into a clear sky at 1:39 a.m., trailing fire as 
it headed out over the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The $65-million Navstar satellite separated from the booster on schedule about 
25 minutes into the flight and settled into an orbit 10,898 miles high. 
</P>
<P>
The satellite is the eighth in a series of advanced Global Positioning System 
spacecraft that guide U.S. and allied warplanes, ships, submarines and troops. 
In some cases, it is accurate to within 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force plans to send up 16 more satellites by early 1993, three of them 
spares, under the $8.5-billion program. The first Navstar spacecraft was 
launched in February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,675-pound Navstar satellites, good in any kind of weather, keep track of 
the speed of military vehicles within a fraction of a mile per hour and the 
time within a millionth of a second. They contain an atomic clock with an error 
rate of one second every 300,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Military personnel tune in the network's coded radio signals with receivers as 
small as a hand-held telephone. Boat and private aircraft operators also have 
access to the system. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas of Huntington Beach, Calif., supplied the 128-foot Delta 2 
launch rocket.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By analysis by Times political writer Bill Stall 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The race: Governor. Whose ad?: Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Dianne Feinstein begins running a 30-second TV commercial today that 
responds to an ad that began airing in mid-July by Republican Sen. Pete Wilson. 
In his ad, Wilson charged that Feinstein would use a quota system for the 
appointment of women and racial minorities in state jobs and ignore whether the 
appointees are qualified. Feinstein has denied both allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the ad, with analysis by Times political writer Bill Stall: 
</P>
<P>
Ad: With the word "Why?" appearing on the screen, and then a San Francisco 
Chronicle article headlined "Mayor (Feinstein) Opposes Charter Quotas," the 
spot opens with an announcer declaring that "Dianne Feinstein opposes hiring 
quotas. She's always opposed quotas. And Pete Wilson knows it." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein is attempting to show that when she was mayor of San 
Francisco, she opposed job quotas and she is questioning why her stand has been 
presented otherwise by Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The question of quotas stems from a campaign appearance before a black audience 
in Los Angeles last May, when Feinstein promised to have "an open and 
accessible Administration" that would "appoint women in proportion to their 
parity of the population -- 50%. To appoint people of color in proportion to 
their parity of the population." Her statement was widely interpreted as 
amounting to a quota system, although she never used that term. Since then, 
Feinstein has described the proposal as a goal to be achieved over time. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: A Chronicle article headlined "Wilson Also Vulnerable on Job Quotas" shows 
on the screen as the announcer asks, "So why is Pete Wilson deliberately 
deceiving you? Because by Pete Wilson's own definition, he has a record in 
favor of quotas. That's right, as senator, Pete Wilson votes for government 
quotas and as mayor of San Diego, Pete Wilson signed a plan to enforce rigid 
hiring percentages based only on sex and race and not merit." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: As San Diego's mayor, Wilson set five-year goals for the hiring of 
women and minorities in city government, and for the promotion of those already 
in government. The Feinstein campaign produced San Diego city 
affirmative-action documents that did not refer to merit, but Wilson aides 
provided a statement from then-Mayor Wilson saying that the policy was intended 
to "reinforce the merit principle in public employment" and was not to be 
interpreted as granting preferential treatment to specific population. 
</P>
<P>
The Feinstein ad also refers to Senate votes for programs that provide that 
certain percentages of federal contracts be set aside for minority-run 
businesses. These are not direct hirings by the government. Set-aside 
contracting has long been a common practice in the federal government.

CANSECO'S 2 HOMERS POWER A'S PAST ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Canseco looks back at Tony La Russa oddly when his manager tells him what 
he thinks of his ability. 
</P>
<P>
La Russa thinks Canseco is better than Canseco thinks he is. 
</P>
<P>
And Canseco doesn't know how that can be, considering what he thinks. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco homered on the first pitch he saw in Oakland's 7-5 victory over the 
Angels at Anaheim Stadium Thursday night, and he homered again in his second 
at-bat, taking over the major league lead from Detroit's Cecil Fielder by 
hitting his 34th of the season. Canseco drove in two more runs with a 
bases-loaded single, and finished the night four for five with five RBIs and 
two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though Cecil will have 25 more games than I will have, I have enough 
confidence I'll beat him," Canseco said. "If I get ahead by two or three home 
runs, I will keep the lead. . . . I don't need a full season to put up 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
His five-RBI performance came despite a shoulder strain suffered last Saturday 
that has slowed him, contributing to a five-for-32 slide with 15 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The A's took a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Devon White's three-run homer was the centerpiece of a four-run Angel fifth 
inning that helped assure that the game did not end in an Oakland blowout. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco's two-homer game was the 17th of his career and the seventh of this 
season. It was also his second in nine days against the Angels. He hit two in a 
13-3 victory over the Angels July 25. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Welch (17-4), the major league leader in victories, gave up four runs on 
six hits in 5 1/3 innings and then waited to see if he would get the victory, 
tying his career best, achieved in each of the past two seasons. Dennis 
Eckersley pitched the ninth for the save, his 33rd. 
</P>
<P>
Welch gave up four hits through the first four innings. But with one out in the 
fifth he issued back-to-back walks to Kent Anderson and Dick Schofield, and 
Luis Polonia drove in the Angels' first run with a single to center. With two 
out, White connected with a full-count pitch for a homer to right-center, his 
eighth of the season. 
</P>
<P>
When Welch gave up back-to-back walks in the sixth inning, the A's brought on 
Todd Burns, who retired the next two batters. 
</P>
<P>
But Burns got into trouble in the seventh. Polonia led off with a single to 
left, took second on a wild pitch and then scored on Donnie Hill's double, his 
second of the game. The A's lead, once 7-0, was 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Nelson relieved Burns and retired White on a ball hit back to the mound. 
Dave Winfield grounded out, as did Lee Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco drove in two runs with his first home run Thursday, a high shot off 
Angel starter Kirk McCaskill (7-8), who had given up an infield hit to Carney 
Lansford. Canseco's third-inning homer, a shot that landed about 20 rows into 
the left-field stands, gave the A's a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Carney Lansford walked with the bases loaded to force in a run in the fourth 
inning and, with Canseco on deck, McCaskill was through. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fetters replaced McCaskill, who gave up six hits and was charged with six 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Fetters went to a 3-and-1 count on Canseco, who delivered a single up the 
middle that drove in two runs for a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Hassey's solo home run, his fifth, off Fetters in the fifth inning put 
Oakland ahead, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven's wife, Patty, and children Kimberly, Timothy and Thomas were in 
good and stable condition at Lone Pine Hospital in Lone Pine, Calif., after 
receiving moderate to minor injuries in an auto accident Thursday afternoon, 
the Angels announced. Blyleven's son Todd was not with the family at the time 
of the accident. Patty, Tom and Kim Blyleven were later flown to St. Joseph 
Hospital. Bert Blyleven reported that they have cuts and scratches and that he 
was returning home with Tim. Blyleven was at the stadium when he learned of the 
accident and left to join his family. Blyleven's next scheduled start is 
Saturday. . . . Pitcher Bob McClure, who has not played this season because of 
tendinitis in his elbow, will begin a rehabilitation assignment with Class-A 
Palm Springs today. He will return to Anaheim Saturday and Sunday and is 
scheduled to pitch on consecutive days at Palm Springs Monday and Tuesday. . . 
. Chili Davis took early batting practice Thursday, saying that on a scale of 
one to 10, 10 being the worst, his back is "about a four or five." He said it 
was about a nine when he went on the disabled list. Davis' is likely to return 
within a week. . . . Former Angel Manager Gene Mauch stood in the stands behind 
home plate and talked through the screen with broadcaster Reggie Jackson and 
Oakland Manager Tony La Russa before the game.

Tests to determine if former Ram linebacker Carl Ekern was under the influence 
of alcohol when he was killed in a one-car crash Wednesday morning were 
negative, according to Jim Malouf, chief coroner investigator for Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern, who was en route to Minden, Nev., where he was a volunteer counselor and 
coach at a camp for juvenile delinquents, died of head injuries he suffered 
when he was thrown from his vehicle after careening off California 395 seven 
miles south of Ridgecrest. 
</P>
<P>
"We found nothing," Malouf said. "No alcohol, no drugs of choice, which is just 
about the way it looked. There was nothing at the scene to indicate alcohol or 
drugs were involved." 
</P>
<P>
Malouf said that Ekern, 36, probably fell asleep at the wheel of his 1984 Jeep, 
awoke as he drifted onto the right shoulder and over-corrected across both 
lanes. The vehicle then struck a dirt berm and became airborne before rolling 
several times. 
</P>
<P>
Malouf also indicated that Ekern might have survived the crash if he had been 
wearing his seatbelt. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had been wearing his seat belt, there's a good possibility he would have 
survived the crash," Malouf said. "There wasn't the kind of damage to the 
vehicle that would have caused these types of injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services have been scheduled for 1 p.m. Tuesday at the Sunnyvale 
Presbyterian Church in Sunnyvale, near San Jose. The Rams, who will be in 
Berlin for an exhibition game against the Kansas City Chiefs next week, will 
attend a special memorial service after their return Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
A trust fund has been established to help with the education of Ekern's three 
children, sons Brett, 7, and Bryce, 6, and daughter Allison, 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
Kicker Mike Lansford, one of a Ekern's closest friends on the team, rushed to 
Ekern's Fountain Valley home to console Ekern's wife, Patti, as soon as he 
heard the news Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time anything like this has ever happened to someone I was 
this close to, so I just kind of reacted," Lansford said. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford said that Patti Ekern came up with the idea of holding the special 
memorial service as a way of allowing members of the team to pay their last 
respects. 
</P>
<P>
"Carl and I did a lot together," Lansford said. "It's such a shame. He lived 
such an aggressive life. He couldn't sit still for one minute. He was always 
reading or exploring or planning or doing an activity. He was just so excited 
about everything." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams previewed their 1989 highlight film, "Fight to the Finish," during 
lunch Wednesday but the film's leading man -- Pro Bowl linebacker Kevin Greene 
-- wasn't on hand. Greene and his agent, Marvin Demoff, met with Ram management 
Wednesday. "No numbers were discussed, but it's sounding better," Greene said 
Thursday. "It doesn't look like I'll be going to Germany, but I do feel like we 
made some progress." Greene said no further meetings are scheduled, but he 
assumes negotiations will resume when the Rams return from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Mel Owens had his lower back examined Thursday and his injury was 
again diagnosed as back spasms. He remains on a day-to-day basis. . . . 
Cornerback Darryl Henley, who was rushed to the hospital after suffering 
hypoglycemic shock Monday, returned to practice Wednesday and promptly suffered 
a right groin strain. Henley is listed as day to day. . . . Linebacker Larry 
Kelm's right big toe was stepped on during Thursday's morning practice and he 
also is listed as day to day.

MORNING BRIEFING: AS EASY AS STEALING CANDY FROM A BABY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK

<TEXT>
<P>
Matt Sewell was an important player for the Trumbull (Conn.) team that won the 
1989 Little League World Series. But evidently, Little League President 
Creighton Hale will be the judge of that. 
</P>
<P>
Last Christmas, as part of its 50th anniversary commemoration, Little League 
headquarters in Williamsport, Pa., sent gift packages to the Trumbull boys. 
Inside were the uniforms they wore in the final game of the Series last August. 
</P>
<P>
Matt, 13, who was batting .500 in the playoffs but broke his wrist delivering 
papers before the World Series, didn't get one. 
</P>
<P>
"It stinks," he told Greg Garber of the Hartford Courant. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Tom Galla, Trumbull's manager, began arguing in Matt's behalf with 
Little League officials. Last week, president Hale turned him down for the last 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Add uniform: Matt was replaced by an alternate and, under Williamsport's rules, 
was not allowed to sit on the bench during games, or to eat or travel with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, however, when the team visited President Bush at the White House, 
Matt was permitted to wear a World Series uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you give a boy a uniform to wear at the White House and then not give 
him one to keep?" Manager Galla asked. "How can they sleep at night?" 
</P>
<P>
Last add uniform: Steve Keener, a Little League spokesman, said originally 
there were 20 of the uniforms. Besides the 14 shipped to Trumbull, he said, one 
hangs in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., another in the Little 
League museum in Williamsport. 
</P>
<P>
Said Galla: "That leaves three or four that are gathering dust." 
</P>
<P>
Said Keener: "The youngster didn't play. Rules are rules." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Before divisional play began in 1969, which major league pennant 
winner held the record for fewest days in first place during a season? 
</P>
<P>
Communications whiz: From Hal Bock of the Associated Press: "During the 1981 
World Series, in an overcrowded Yankee Stadium press room where newsmen stepped 
gingerly over each other's wires and cables, (Howard) Spira nearly caused a 
riot by knocking out the computer plug of a nationally known baseball 
columnist. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always around, often viewed almost as an annoyance by beat writers 
struggling for interviewing space. He would never be deterred, persistent in 
selling his taped interviews, wearing down radio editors until they agreed to 
use his material." 
</P>
<P>
Lost in the scramble: In the recent Bank of Boston Classic, no fewer than six 
golfers were disqualified in the first two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Don Pooley and Dan Forsman distinguished themselves from the other four. In the 
first round, they inadvertently played one another's ball for three holes. 
</P>
<P>
Speed limit 97 m.p.h.: According to United Press International, officials in 
Brazoria County and Harris County, Texas, are making plans to rename Texas 
Highway 288 the Nolan Ryan Expressway. 
</P>
<P>
Stroke of genius: On this day in 1852, America's first intercollegiate athletic 
competition, a rowing race between Harvard and Yale, was held on Lake 
Winnipesaukee, N.H. On a two-mile course, Harvard won by four boat lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The 1951 New York Giants, three days. 
</P>
<P>
Dog and pony exacta: This Saturday and Sunday at Hollywood Park, the Kennel 
Club of Los Angeles will stage California's first European format dog show. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons of Hollypark's satellite wagering from Del Mar are cautioned not to 
confuse the two. 
</P>
<P>
For the record: An item in Thursday's Morning Briefing reported that a New York 
Daily News cartoon included a Yankee logo turned into a swastika. The logo was 
in fact turned into a Maltese Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Jim Bouton, author and former New York Yankee pitcher, on George 
Steinbrenner: "I think his being kicked out of baseball is really bad for 
American business and human relations because we have now lost a symbol of how 
not to do things." TED BROCK

TV-RADIO: CLIPPERS STILL CAN'T FIND THE RIGHT TICKET FOR PRIME VIEWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leave it to the Clippers -- they've lost another one. 
</P>
<P>
The team was trying to make a deal with Prime Ticket, but negotiations have 
broken off. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the problem essentially was that the Clippers wanted more money 
than the Lakers get, which is about $95,000 a game. 
</P>
<P>
With the acquisition of Bo Kimble, things are looking up for the Clippers, but 
are they hardly worth more than the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Now it appears the Clippers are left to accept whatever SportsChannel offers or 
rely solely on Channel 5 for local TV revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The bad thing for viewers is less access to the Clippers. Prime Ticket reaches 
4.1 million homes. SportsChannel, which costs extra, reaches fewer than 
150,000. 
</P>
<P>
The principals in the negotiations -- John Severino, Prime Ticket president, 
and Bob Steele, chief executive office of the Donald Sterling Corp. -- declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 4's planned boycott of PGA Championship highlights has been called off. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the station's sports department announced that it would not 
show highlights of next week's tournament as a way of protesting Shoal Creek 
Country Club's all-white membership policy. 
</P>
<P>
But that plan was rescinded after the Birmingham, Ala., club accepted a black 
member. Channel 4 had intended to report the daily results of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"My producers and I feel so strongly about discrimination that we felt it was 
important to speak out," said Fred Roggin, the station's sports director, from 
New York, where he was attending meetings of NBC football announcers. "We did a 
strong commentary two weeks ago, but we wanted to do more. Our aim was to avoid 
publicizing Shoal Creek by showing the course." 
</P>
<P>
NBC has done some re-aligning of its pro football announcers. The significant 
changes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Todd Christensen replaces Merlin Olsen as Charlie Jones' partner. Olsen is 
now at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joel Meyers' partner will be Ahmad Rashad, with Meyers' former partner, 
Paul Maguire, joining Marv Albert. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don Criqui will be teamed with Bob Trumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Newcomer Cris Collinsworth will be paired with play-by-play man Jim 
Donovan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roggin will work at least one game with San Diego counterpart Jim Laslavic 
of Channel 39 and is tentatively scheduled to fill in for Jones and work with 
Christensen on the Raider-Charger game in San Diego Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL exhibition season opens this weekend with the Hall of Fame game between 
Chicago and Cleveland on ABC Saturday at 10 a.m., Seattle and Denver on ESPN 
Saturday night at 5 from Tokyo and the Raiders and New Orleans on NBC Sunday at 
10 a.m. from London. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL has made several moves to speed up games this season, mainly reducing 
halftime from 15 minutes to 12 and the time between plays from 30 seconds to 
25. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in most cases, the clock will start as soon as the referee signals, 
rather than with the snap, except for the final two minutes of the first half 
and final five minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
There have been discussions about using Bob Miller only on Prime Ticket 
telecasts of the Kings, which would be a mistake. As with Chick Hearn, when you 
have an announcer the caliber of a Bob Miller, you use him on both radio and 
TV, despite any drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is for Miller to do the telecasts with a new commentator, possibly 
former King Jim Fox, now an executive with the club, and for Nick Nickson and 
another new commentator to handle the radio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based XTRA (690), the Kings' new flagship station, is becoming more 
and more sports-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
It recently added all-night sports programming that runs from 8 p.m. until 5 
a.m., including talk and trivia segments. The syndicated programming, called 
"The Sports Final," comes from Star Communications in Boston and is also 
carried by 85 other stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Former "Sportstalk" hosts Bud Furillo and Tommy Hawkins will appear on the KABC 
radio show with Ed (Superfan) Bieler Monday at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The station planned to have more of a reunion of former hosts, but most have 
scheduling conflicts or refused to appear. 
</P>
<P>
Had all shown up, a referee might have been in order. They're not all exactly 
the best of friends. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Englebrecht's annual sportscasting camp at Loyola Marymount begins today 
and runs through next Thursday, with 165 prospective sportscasters from 40 
states participating. Instructors include Miller, the camp's co-director; 
Hearn, Al Conin, Roy Firestone and Joel Meyers. For details, call (714) 
760-3131. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
With Sunday Silence's retirement on Thursday, ABC announced it will not 
televise Saturday's Arlington Challenge as part of "Wide World of Sports." 
Sunday Silence, scheduled to run in the race, suffered a strained ligament in 
his left foreleg. . . . SportsChannel made it official Thursday. Ken Brett will 
be the pay-cable channel's new Angel commentator, replacing Joe Torre. . . . 
Paul Olden, named to replace Torre on KTLA and to fill in for Brett on radio 
when Brett is on SportsChannel, will be missing more "Sportsline" assignments. 
Jim Healy, asked if he might do some "Sportsline" fill-in work, said: "There 
are two chances of that, slimsky and nonesky." . . . XTRA will carry radio 
coverage of the baseball Hall of Fame ceremony Sunday at 10:30 a.m. when Joe 
Morgan and Jim Palmer are inducted. 
</P>
<P>
With CBS losing the NBA to NBC, Hubie Brown, rather than staying at CBS as a 
college basketball analyst, has left the network to join TBS as an NBA analyst. 
. . . TBS lost analyst Steve Jones to NBC. Jones will be paired with Bob Costas 
this season. . . . Sunday night's all-star game at the Forum, "A Midsummer 
Night's Magic," will be taped for showing on NBC Aug. 11. Although the NBC team 
of Marv Albert and Mike Fratello will announce the game, Prime Ticket is 
producing the coverage. . . . Recommended viewing: Bud Greenspan's outstanding 
"Seoul '88: 16 Days of Glory" will be shown on the Disney Channel Sunday night 
at 9, plus next Thursday and Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' main college football announcing team will be Jim Nantz and Tim Brant, who 
replaces Pat Haden, now at TBS. The No. 2 team will be newcomer Brad Nessler, a 
former Atlantic Coast Conference announcer, and Dan Jiggetts. . . . Former Pitt 
coach Mike Gottfried has been hired as a football analyst by ESPN. . . . The 
Subaru NFL's Fastest Man competition, taped May 19 at College of the Desert in 
Palm Desert, will be on NBC's "SportsWorld" Sunday. Participants include Ron 
Brown and Willie Gault of the Raiders and Flipper Anderson of the Rams. . . . 
Brace yourself. Channel 7 is bringing back Todd Donoho's "Monday Night Live," 
that wacky show that aired after "Monday Night Football" last season. The first 
installment this year will be Aug. 13, after a New York Giant-Buffalo 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket, beginning with quarterfinals tonight, is offering coverage of the 
Volvo/Los Angeles tennis tournament through the weekend. The announcers are 
Drew Goodman, Barry MacKay and Vitas Gerulaitis. . . . ESPN has acquired the 
rights to the richest tennis tournament in history, the $6-million Grand Slam 
Cup, to be played in Munich in December. The winner in the 16-man field will 
get $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing beat: HBO has an attractive tripleheader coming up Aug. 11 from Caesars 
Tahoe, with Pernell Whitaker, Meldrick Taylor and Hector (Macho) Camacho on the 
card. . . . On the market now is a 90-minute video, "Two Faces of a Champion," 
which shows Mike Tyson's destruction of Carl (the Truth) Williams, followed by 
his loss to Buster Douglas. . . . The USA network, in a call-in survey, asked 
viewers to pick who would win in a fight between George Foreman and Tyson. 
Would you believe 70% (9,958 viewers) voted for Foreman? . . . Kick boxing is 
the latest sport to try pay-per-view. A card featuring Bill (Superfoot) Wallace 
against Joe Lewis Monday night at 6 from Harrah's Tahoe is being distributed to 
cable systems by Viewer's Choice. The suggested price is $14.95. 
</P>
<P>
Kudos to Channel 4 sports producer Jeff Hoffman for another outstanding 
steroids-related feature. This one was on Victor Bovino of Marina del Rey, who 
sells a product that masks steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to 
avoid test detection. An athlete simply takes Bovino's product a few hours 
before he's scheduled to be tested. It's another example that steroid use won't 
go away until sports officials start getting serious about it.

Steffi Graf struggled before ousting Lori McNeil Thursday in the third round of 
the Player's Challenge Canadian Open at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Graf won, 7-5, 6-3, the first time in five meetings she had beaten McNeil in 
straight sets. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina and Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria, seeded second 
and third behind Graf, had much easier times advancing. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini lost the opening game to Raffaella Reggi of Italy before winning the 
next 12 for a 6-1, 6-0 win, and Maleeva defeated New Zealand's Julie 
Richardson, 6-0, 6-0, at the hardcourt event at Jarry Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva, Katerina's older sister, defeated Helen Kelesi 
of Canada, 6-3, 2-6, 6-3, and fifth-seeded Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet Union 
disposed of Britain's Jo Durie, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Wostenholme launched a pair of decisive passing shots to gain an 11th 
game service break to take a 7-5, 6-1 victory over Paul Annacone in 
second-round play at the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships Thursday at Brookline, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't very sharp," said Annancone. "When I came to the net at five-all, he 
hit a couple of good passing shots to break my service and I never could get 
back into the match." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 27-year-old Wostenholme, Annacone said: "He runs real well and returns 
shots that you'd think were unreturnable." 
</P>
<P>
David Wheaton withdrew after aggravating a hip injury suffered last week in 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Boris Becker and local favorites Thomas Muster and Horst Skoff 
scored victories and advanced to the quarterfinals of the Austrian Open in 
Kitzbuehel, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Becker played unevenly but managed to oust Sweden's David Engel, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Muster, seeded fourth, beat Marian Vajda of Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 6-0, and will 
face Skoff in the quarterfinals. The sixth-seeded Skoff beat Spain's Tomas 
Carbonell, 6-2, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
A third Austrian, 10th-seeded Anton Antonitsch, was beaten by Czechoslovakia's 
Karel Novacek, 6-3, 6-7 (7-4), 6-4.

College juniors planning to declare for the NFL draft will be required to do so 
by Feb. 1 under a new set of guidelines set down by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In letters from Tagliabue to college athletic officials, the NFL said it would 
also increase the number of draft-eligible players brought in for evaluation at 
the annual scouting combine and limit off-season mini-camps to three days, two 
of which must fall on Saturday and Sunday, until the end of the academic 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
College officials had expressed dismay at interference in the academic year by 
pro scouts and tryout camps that caused many players to leave school. An 
Associated Press survey last month revealed that 198 of the 331 players drafted 
in April did not complete their academic studies, and that at least 82 were one 
semester or less from finishing their degrees.

Sprinter Carl Lewis, the world record-holder at 100 meters, is expected to be 
sidelined for the next three weeks after suffering a leg injury during a New 
York track meet in last week, Tom Tellez said. 
</P>
<P>
Tellez, coach at the University of Houston, said Lewis was to run in Brussels 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a cramp than a pull," Tellez said. "It's not as bad as a pull, 
but you still have some bleeding in the muscle." 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted an unidentified source as saying Lewis would not 
race Ben Johnson this year in a showdown of the world's two fastest sprinters. 
Johnson defeated Lewis in the 1988 Olympic 100 final but was subsequently 
disqualified for two years after testing positive for steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's ban ends Sept. 24 and a series of match races between the sprinters 
was discussed.

SILVEIRA LEADS BY 3 AFTER A 62 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Silveira tamed the Tournament Player's Club course at Southwind with a 
course record nine-under-par 62 Thursday to take a three-stroke lead after the 
first round of the St. Jude Classic at Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Silveira, a second-year pro who started on the back nine, made the turn at 
four-under 31 after dropping a 20-foot birdie putt at the par-four 18th and 
then turned in a string of four birdies in five holes beginning at the par-four 
second hole. 
</P>
<P>
The former University of Arizona All-American broke the previous record of 63, 
set last year by Doug Tewell and Hubert Green, with a two-foot birdie putt at 
the par-four ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Gardner, Rick Fehr, Nick Price and Chip Beck, the winner at last week's 
Buick Open, are three shots back. 
</P>
<P>
Silveira, who has failed to make the cut in 10 of 19 tournaments this year, had 
a best finish of 10th at the Deposit Guaranty Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what the course record was," he said. "I just got on a roll and 
things started happening. I didn't leave a putt short, so that shows you what 
kind of confidence I had." 
</P>
<P>
Korean Ok-Hee Ku celebrated her 34th birthday with a tournament-record 64 for a 
five-stroke lead after the first round of the $350,000 LPGA Boston Five Classic 
at Danvers, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Ku, who has been having her worst year in five on the pro tour and had missed 
the cut in her past three tournaments, had nine birdies and one bogey to break 
the tournament record of 65 set by Marta Figueras-Dotti in 1985 and tied in 
1986 by Laurie Rinker. 
</P>
<P>
The round, which matched Ku's best competitive effort, put her into the lead at 
windy Tara Ferncroft Country Club as Dottie Mochrie and Cindy Rarick tied for 
second at 69. 
</P>
<P>
Ku sank birdie putts ranging up to 27 feet and birdied four of the last five 
holes on the front side, finishing with a four-footer that gave her the record. 
</P>
<P>
Ku's best finish in 1990 is a seventh at Tucson more than four months ago. She 
has earned only $20,515 in 10 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Katrina Douglas of England, recovering from a wasp sting during a practice 
round, shot a four-under-par 69 to take the first-round lead in the British 
Women's Open at Woburn, England. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl Sinn of Bellflower was in a group tied for second, one stroke behind. 
</P>
<P>
Two strokes off the lead was Muffin Spencer-Devlin, making her first appearance 
at Woburn since she was disqualified from a tournament in April for an outburst 
at a pro-am dinner. 
</P>
<P>
She banged her fists on a table and shouted at the tournament director in a 
dispute over where she should sit. She later blamed the outburst on manic 
depression.

SEX ABUSE CASES ROCK THE AMERICAN CLERGY; 
</P>
<P>
DISCLOSURES OF MISCONDUCT -- A PROBLEM HIDDEN FOR YEARS -- ARE ON THE RISE. AND 
SOME DENOMINATIONS ARE DEVELOPING GUIDELINES FOR HANDLING OFFENSES. 
</P>

<P>
Religious organizations increasingly are being rocked by sexual misconduct 
among clergy, leading to embarrassing public disclosures and costly lawsuits 
that have forced several churches into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
While the painful problem sometimes results in resignations or reassignments, 
churches are facing allegations that they ignore warnings or, worse, attempt 
cover-ups. 
</P>
<P>
The latest scandal involves Roman Catholic Archbishop Eugene Marino. Church 
officials acknowledged Thursday that he had resigned last month as head of the 
Atlanta Archdiocese because of a two-year "intimate relationship" with Vicki R. 
Long, a 27-year-old woman who once charged that another priest had fathered her 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 2,000 cases of sexual abuse by clergy are pending in the courts, 
according to insurance agents who specialize in church matters, and a new 
specialty class of lawyers expert in suing, defending or counseling churches 
regarding sexual misconduct has sprung up. Most insurers have quit issuing 
coverage for such liabilities or have limited it. 
</P>
<P>
"Today the number of credible sexual abuse and misconduct cases is astounding," 
said John F. Cleary, general counsel for the Church Mutual Insurance Co. of 
Merill, Wis., which insures 46,000 churches. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a hidden problem for generations," acknowledged Evangelical 
Lutheran Bishop Robert Keller of Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Sexual misconduct among clergy is less than within the population at large, 
experts say, but ministers are often held to a higher moral standard. 
</P>
<P>
Some denominations are developing guidelines for reporting and handling sex 
offenses as well as helping the offenders in their ranks. Occasionally, 
guidelines call for the church to pay for professional help for the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Ministerial sex offenders come in all ages and range from the unknown to the 
high profile. 
</P>
<P>
The sex scandals of televangelists Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart shocked the 
Pentecostal and evangelical churches in the late 1980s. More recently, mainline 
church leaders expressed dismay when the Rev. Allan Boesak, an anti-apartheid 
leader who headed reformed churches worldwide, tearfully resigned his 
pastorate, confessing to an extramarital affair with the niece of a former 
South African Cabinet minister. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, from Bangor, Me., to Cleveland to Chicago to San Diego, 
well-publicized ministerial misdeeds have scandalized the faithful. 
</P>
<P>
A former Orange County priest who pleaded guilty in 1986 to molesting four 
altar boys in his Huntington Beach parish recently violated a condition of his 
parole by being with a New Mexico boy without another adult present. Father 
Andrew Christian Andersen's parole was revoked and he is now in state prison 
serving a six-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The Milwaukee Synod of the The Milwaukee Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran 
Church in America made headlines last year when four of its clergy were charged 
with sexual misbehavior. And in an unusual clergy vs. clergy case in 
Minneapolis, a woman Lutheran minister has filed suit against the male senior 
pastor, alleging that he fired her after she complained about his sexual 
advances. 
</P>
<P>
A civil court judge in Dallas has ruled that a well-known United Methodist 
minister "brutally attempted to strangle his wife" while he was having a secret 
affair with another woman. The Rev. Walker Railey later tried to commit suicide 
and the case remains under criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, an Episcopal priest was recently sentenced to six years in state 
prison for molesting a 7-year-old boy in his church office in 1985, and a 
Hermosa Beach Greek Orthodox priest was sentenced last spring to nine years in 
prison for molesting two teen-age boys belonging to the church youth group. 
</P>
<P>
There are no national statistics on sexual misconduct by clergy. But based on 
his 19 years as a confidential clergy counselor, one Presbyterian minister 
estimates that about 10% of the nation's clergy have been or are engaged in 
sexual misconduct ranging from harassment and "inappropriate touching" to 
fornication, adultery and pedophilia. Surveys by United Methodists and Southern 
Baptists have come to similar conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
"Many . . . clergy don't realize how vulnerable and close to disaster they 
are," said the Rev. G. Lloyd Rediger of Roseville, Minn., drawing on his 15,000 
hours of experience counseling clergy for the Wisconsin Conference of Churches. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists who work with errant ministers say that the reasons for sexual 
temptations are many, including the intimate relationships clergy often develop 
with parishioners in counseling situations, a change in the nation's sexual 
attitudes, divorce among clergy, changes in the family structure and lax 
denominational disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the publicity about clergy sexual misconduct has centered on the Roman 
Catholic Church. This is not only because it is the nation's largest religious 
organization, but also because it has the greatest number of institutions 
serving children and youth. 
</P>
<P>
The spotlight has often focused on allegations that church leaders have tried 
-- often unsuccessfully -- to cover up the misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Catholic Church's sexual Watergate," says Jason Berry of New Orleans, 
a free-lance investigator who is writing a book about clergy sexual abuse and 
who helped expose a sexual scandal involving priests in Louisiana six years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, Berry said, there have been at least 100 settlements by Catholic 
authorities in the last six years amounting to somewhere between $100 million 
and $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
All too often, Berry asserted, "the essential moral and pastoral positions of 
the church have been betrayed . . . by local bishops who have resorted to 
strategies of concealment, sheltering priests and bunkering in behind defense 
attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
Sealed records and secret settlements only allow the offenders to continue 
their patterns of abuse, Barry said. But he added: "In many instances, 
attorneys bargain dollars for silence." However, Phillip Harris, a staff 
attorney for the U.S. Catholic Conference, vigorously denied that the church 
has engaged in cover-ups. 
</P>
<P>
"To say there's a nationwide policy to pay for silence is not only unfair but 
is a simplistic approach," Harris said. In many cases settled privately, he 
added, a confidentiality order was imposed at the request of the victim or the 
victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's appropriate," Harris declared. "You're talking about a problem 
where it's very hard to get proof. In that kind of situation you don't want to 
ruin the lives or reputations of anyone . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
An attempt Thursday to reach officers of the National Conference of Catholic 
Bishops for comment was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
The largest scandal of its kind in North American church history reverberated 
throughout Canada last month when a church commission sternly rebuked 
Archbishop Alphonsus Penney of Newfoundland for turning a blind eye toward the 
illicit behavior of church workers. More than 30 priests, former priests and 
religious brothers have been charged or convicted of molesting altar boys, 
orphans and other children. Penney abruptly resigned, confessing the failure. 
</P>
<P>
Other cases of pedophilia involving Catholic priests have come to light in 
recent years in virtually every major U.S. city, including Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Anderson, a St. Paul, Minn., lawyer who specializes in prosecuting child 
abuse cases, said he's aware of more than 300 claims of sexual misconduct 
against Catholic priests -- he has handled 80 cases himself -- in 43 states. 
Several well-known priests have been named in the charges. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Father Bruce Ritter, founder of Covenant House, the refuge for 
runaways, was forced to resign after reports that he sexually abused some of 
the organization's troubled youths. And in Washington, Father George A. 
Stallings, the breakaway Catholic priest who a year ago formed the 
Afro-American Imani Temple, has been accused of sexual relationships with 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Stallings has declined to answer when asked whether he had sex with boys, and 
Ritter has denied enticing youths into sexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
The case that first set the U.S. Catholic Church reeling surfaced in Louisiana 
in 1984. Father Gilbert Gauthe was convicted a year later on 11 counts of 
sexually abusing children. But his was only the most publicized of the cases in 
the diocese that, in all, involved 21 church workers. Berry said the Lafayette 
Diocese paid close to $20 million in compensation to victims and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
A 100-page report sent in 1985 to every American bishop warned that if other 
bishops and diocesan attorneys engaged in cover-ups similar to the one in 
Lafayette, the church could face $1 billion in claims over the next decade. The 
report recommended immediate counseling with afflicted families and removing 
the priest to a competent medical facility. The paper was never formally 
endorsed, although parts of it have been incorporated into diocesan guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the major Protestant bodies have adopted accountability rules 
for clergy misconduct, the Catholic Church has yet to develop a national policy 
on the subject. However, in the last several years many individual Catholic 
dioceses -- including the Archdiocese of Los Angeles -- have adopted guidelines 
that mandate the reporting of sex abuse incidents to both church and law 
enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, the lawyer representing the U.S. Catholic bishops, said he thinks there 
is now a "greater willingness within the church and society in general" to talk 
about clergy sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that new openness is due to changes that make such conduct harder to 
conceal. 
</P>
<P>
Child abuse cases dating back as far as the 1950s are only recently coming to 
light in litigation, according to Anderson, the St. Paul prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is increasingly feeling empowered and realizes these wrongs are 
actionable," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Added Father Andrew Greeley, the well-known sociologist and author: "Parents 
are no longer willing to hush up abuse of their children 'for the good of the 
church.' " 
</P>
<P>
Changes in the law make it easier for children to testify and state laws now 
require child abuse to be reported. 
</P>
<P>
Often, said Cleary, the church insurance lawyer, attorneys are able to persuade 
courts to throw out the statute of limitations when considering child abuse 
cases because the victims may repress the memory of the abuse for years. 
</P>
<P>
While the number of reported cases of clergy misconduct has risen dramatically 
in the last several years, many wonder if such abuse is actually greater now, 
or if there is simply greater awareness of the problem and a stronger 
determination to take action. 
</P>
<P>
Experts differ. Dr. Fred S. Berlin, a psychiatrist who heads the Sexual 
Disorders Clinic at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital, thinks it's partly an 
increased recognition of a problem "that's always been there." But he also 
points to the increased number of children in day care facilities operated by 
religious organizations, which he believes increases their exposure to 
potential molesters. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say the Catholic Church's insistence on celibacy for priests 
increases sexual tensions. And Berry charges that a "promiscuous, gay 
subculture rampant within clerical life is eroding the cornerstone of 
celibacy." 
</P>
<P>
But there seems to be no proven link between celibacy and pedophilia. Berlin 
and other authorities say that sexual orientation directed toward children 
apparently develops during childhood. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church operates several treatment centers with special programs 
for pedophiles. Among the most prominent are St. Luke Institute outside 
Washington and Villa Louis Martin in Jemez Springs, N. M. 
</P>
<P>
Psychological screening of applicants is routinely done at Catholic seminaries. 
But Msgr. Thomas Curry, vicar for priests in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, 
pointed out that no test is able to screen out pedophiles. 
</P>
<P>
New guidelines adopted last year by the Los Angeles Archdiocese call for 
accusations against a priest to be investigated as "quickly and thoroughly as 
possible." But no action will be taken "on the basis of anonymous, 
uncorroborated accusations." If there does appear to be a problem, the priest 
is to be moved away until a full investigation is completed. At present, no 
child molestation suits are pending against priests in the archdiocese, Curry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At least four mainline Protestant denominations have adopted or are developing 
national guidelines regarding clergy sexual misconduct. The Presbyterian 
Church, for example, requires that whenever a pastor relocates, background 
checks must be made on previous employment for at least the last five years. 
Regional Presbyterian courts also have the power to investigate allegations 
and, if necessary, discipline offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of most denominations agree that, at the very least, the offender's 
next congregation should be fully informed of his or her misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like these things not to be public," said Michael Schwartz, a layman who 
heads the Washington-based Catholics for an Open Church. "But systematic 
suppression of information protects the guilty -- not the innocent . . . . 
There's a balance that has to be struck between protecting the image of the 
church and protecting the integrity of the church."

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE IN A WORRISOME DOWNTURN; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICES: EXPERTS BELIEVE THE MARKET IS IN EARLY STATES OF A BUST THAT COULD 
LAST TWO YEARS OR MORE AND DEPRESS THE REGION'S ECONOMY FURTHER. 
</P>

<P>
Southern California's once-booming commercial real estate market, which 
dramatically altered the region's office skylines in the 1980s, is in the early 
stages of a bust that may last two years or more, property experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
While not as severe as in other regions of the country, the downturn 
nonetheless could further depress the Southern California economy when it is 
already reeling from thousands of aerospace industry layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the throes of a real estate recession . . , and a national recession 
would only make that worse," said Andrew S. Kane, a real estate specialist in 
the Los Angeles office of the Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
The office market is slumping in Orange and San Diego counties, and it appears 
to be particularly bad in downtown Los Angeles, which faces the prospect of 
massive overbuilding. With some buildings in major financial difficulties, 
there is further trouble ahead for banks, savings and loans and other lenders 
that already have experienced large losses on building loans gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
Older office buildings in downtown Los Angeles have vacancy rates as high as 
80%, and some new buildings are not faring much better. In some markets, office 
rents have been falling for some time, a trend that is expected to continue as 
more office buildings open. 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by easy credit from U.S. lenders and heavy foreign investment from 
nations such as Japan, Southern California went through an unprecedented office 
building boom in the mid- to late 1980s that gave dramatic new skylines to Long 
Beach, Westwood and Costa Mesa as well as the downtowns of Los Angeles and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Though Japanese investment has tailed off and construction loans are no longer 
easy to obtain in Southern California, the region remains in the final stages 
of a building frenzy that is adding millions of square feet of unneeded office 
space. (A typical middle-class home has 1,000 to 2,000 square feet of space.) 
</P>
<P>
The breakneck pace of office construction is not expected to last much beyond 
next year. Foreign investors no longer see greater Los Angeles as a superior 
investment opportunity, and banks, under pressure from regulators because of 
huge problems facing the savings and loan industry, have scaled back real 
estate lending. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that lots of deals are falling through now because the 
financing is not coming together," said David A. Eisner, a real estate 
specialist for Price Waterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Difficulty obtaining financing has caused problems for the planned $650-million 
Watt City Center, a residential and commercial complex on the west side of the 
Harbor Freeway in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Ray Watt said that he needs to find a major tenant for the office 
space before lenders will give him the money to begin construction. He said 
that he may also raise money by selling an equity interest to outside 
investors.

Although demand has leveled off, office space in downtown Los Angeles is still 
rising at an unprecedented rate. "More office space is coming on line than at 
any time in the history of this city," said John C. Cushman III, a well-known 
Los Angeles real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
Several major office buildings under construction in downtown Los Angeles are 
expected to increase office space there by more than one-fifth, pushing vacancy 
rates from 16% to as much as 25%. 
</P>
<P>
"Downtown is pretty scary for a lot of people right now," said David Ash, 
senior vice president of Eastdil Realty, a real estate investment firm. "It's 
going to be difficult times ahead. The question is: Will they last two years, 
three years or four?" 
</P>
<P>
The commercial office market in the San Fernando Valley, which is less 
overbuilt, appears to be the exception. The office vacancy rate there was 14% 
in the second quarter of 1990, down slightly from earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Vacancy rates are a key indicator of regional economic health, generally 
mirroring employment levels in white-collar trades such as financial services, 
insurance and the law. A healthy vacancy rate is 7% to 10%, according to 
Sanford Goodkin, a real estate consultant in San Diego for the accounting firm 
KPMG Peat Marwick. 
</P>
<P>
With falling housing prices and major layoffs in the aerospace industry, Wall 
Street investment firms are turning out bearish reports on the region's 
commercial real estate scene. The office-market downturn also has spilled over 
into retail and industrial leasing, real estate experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Several large financial institutions in California have disclosed large 
writeoffs, in part because commercial real estate loans have gone unpaid. Wells 
Fargo and Bank of America recently repossessed two office buildings in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the savings and loan industry's current problem stems from 
office-building loans that went into default in states such as Texas and 
Arizona after their regional economies turned down. In recent weeks, two large 
California S&amp;Ls, CalFed and HomeFed, announced large losses partly because 
of commercial-loan problems in California. 
</P>
<P>
Most property experts, though, continue to believe that Southern California 
probably will not experience a recession in commercial property as severe as 
those that hit major U.S. cities from New York and Boston to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Besides a diversified economy, Southern California has had Japanese buyers who 
have "put a floor under the market," Goodkin said. Nearly a third of the office 
space in downtown Los Angeles is now owned by Japanese investors, according to 
Cushman. 
</P>
<P>
A close look at regional markets shows that some are faring far better than 
others. Burbank and Glendale, for example, are benefitting from a migration of 
entertainment-connected firms from Century City, according to Salomon Bros., 
the New York investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
Office vacancies around Los Angeles International Airport, though, have been 
high for years and are expected to get higher because of layoffs in the 
aerospace industry and cutbacks by the military, two major office tenants in 
that area. Office vacancies north of the airport are running as high as 34%, 
said commercial broker Bill Goodglick. 
</P>
<P>
H. Carl Muhlstein, a commercial broker for Wilrock National in Los Angeles, 
said that effective rents downtown have fallen 10% to 15% in the past two years 
and will continue dropping. "There's a lot of (leasing) business," Muhlstein 
said, "but rents are terribly depressed." 
</P>
<P>
Sluggish office demand accompanied by the sharp increase in supply has 
accelerated an already stiff competition for office tenants, who are breaking 
their leases in droves in favor the new office digs. 
</P>
<P>
Major new tenants are receiving lucrative incentives, such as 18 months of free 
office space, if they relocate to the new buildings. "There is a slash-and-burn 
philosophy among the major tenants in downtown Los Angeles," said Todd 
Anderson, a vice president for the Faulkner Co., a commercial brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
The accelerating tenant exodus has been particularly difficult for landlords of 
older office buildings, especially those built before the mid-1960s. Many of 
these buildings are a third or more empty, according to figures from Wilrock 
National, a brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most prominent buildings in trouble is Giannini Place in downtown 
Los Angeles, built in 1922 by Bank of America founder A. P. Giannini. Bank of 
America recently repossessed the building, which is nearly 50% vacant. Bank 
officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other troubled commercial developments that dot the Southern 
California landscape is Andrex Point, an office complex along the San Diego 
Freeway near Gardena that Wells Fargo recently repossessed. 
</P>
<P>
A Wells Fargo spokeswoman confirmed that Andrex Point, built in 1988, has not 
been a financial success because rents have been "dropping significantly." She 
added that the 12-story building, which is half empty, is the bank's only 
problem office building in California. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Los Angeles' tony Westside, with its tougher building restrictions, the 
office market is surprisingly soft, real estate experts say. One office 
high-rise in Westwood known as Center West, owned by businessman Kambiz Hekmat, 
is only 25% occupied. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-year-old structure on the fringe of downtown Los Angeles that has struggled 
since it opened is the WCT Building, owned by East Asian financier Ming Yu 
Tsai. Located at 1100 Wilshire on the west side of the Harbor Freeway, the 
38-story office tower has only three tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley is a different story. Seth Dudley, Valley branch 
manager for the commercial brokerage firm Julien J. Studley Inc., noted that 
the area benefits from lower office rents than the Westside and downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Dudley said, however, that a severe office-space shortage may materialize in 
certain areas of the Valley in coming years partly because zoning changes and 
building moratoriums in some business centers have restricted development. 
Shortages are starting to develop in areas such as Encino, where 96% of all 
office space is occupied, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County more closely resembles downtown Los Angeles. A region with an 
economy the size of Norway's, Orange County has 50 million square feet of 
office space, most of it built in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
About a fifth of that office space -- the equivalent of all the space in New 
York's twin-towered World Trade Center -- stands vacant, while another 3 
million square feet is now under construction. As in Los Angeles, rents have 
slid as landlords wave incredible deals at tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Among the landlords looking to bail out is is Columbia Savings &amp; Loan, the 
Beverly Hills-based thrift that is now insolvent because of its investments in 
risky securities and commercial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Savings has built several office towers with Koll Co., a large 
developer based in Newport Beach. Columbia is trying to sell the buildings, but 
anticipates losing at least $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego office market is likewise overbuilt, with a countywide vacancy 
rate hovering around 20%, and much higher in some suburban markets. "From a 
developer's standpoint, the office market is as tough as I've ever seen it," 
said Dennis Cruzan, a San Diego developer. 
</P>

O.C. ARABS ANXIOUSLY AWAIT NEWS FROM HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A frantic Michael Marwan Sbaita waited anxiously by the telephone Thursday, 
hoping for word that relatives stranded in Kuwait were safe from invading Iraqi 
forces, and he spoke angrily of the U.S. government's and other Arab countries' 
failure to intervene militarily. 
</P>
<P>
"I am just devastated," said Sbaita, a 30-year-old international marketing 
representative for a Tustin computer firm. "I cannot get over the fact that the 
United States of America is doing nothing and other Arab nations are doing 
nothing to help Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Sbaita said he has been unable to contact his two brothers and a sister in the 
suburbs of Kuwait City. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives in Jordan, including Sbaita's parents who were on vacation from their 
homeland, have gotten word from a cousin who has been stranded in her bank 
office in downtown Kuwait because of the invading troops. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is there American silence?" Sbaita asked in anguish. "I have no clue where 
my family is right now. . . . I can't begin to explain what sort of agony I am 
going through." 
</P>
<P>
Sbaita, who was born in Kuwait to Palestinian parents, was one of a number of 
Arabs living in Orange County who nervously watched developments in the 
oil-rich Persian Gulf nation. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Thursday night of the Arab-American Republican Party of Orange 
County, members expressed concern and alarm about the volatile situation in the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"Something has got to be done to stop the killing," said George Hanna, 61, of 
Santa Ana, whose parents are from Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Most members of the Arab-American organization, a political action committee, 
generally indicated they did not favor American intervention in the conflict 
unless U.S. interests become threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Elias Bordcosh, 43, of Fountain Valley, a Palestinian who grew up in Lebanon, 
said he believes "not one American life" should be expended in trying to quell 
the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Another club member, Kamal Shublak, 43, of Westminster, also a Palestinian, 
said he also opposes American intervention "for any political reasons," but he 
said the United States may have to act in the conflict for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very worried about another oil shortage like we had in 1973," said 
Shublak. He added that if an oil shortage threatens the American economy, the 
United States should become involved to protect its interests. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is something that the Arab League should deal with in a peaceful 
manner," said Mounzer Chaarani, 48, of North Tustin. Chaarani, a native of 
Lebanon, said he did not think the United States should become embroiled in the 
conflict. "Non-Arab countries should be very careful about this situation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the several hundred Iraqis in Orange County expressed dismay that 
Iraq's president, military strongman Saddam Hussein, decided to unleash tanks, 
military aircraft and ground troops on its smaller neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very saddened by it, it's terrible," said one Iraqi living in Orange 
County who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals against relatives 
in Iraq and Kuwait. "I thought they would settle the dispute through 
negotiation instead of using force." 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Kuwait would be only the first step in the Iraqi president's 
march to bolster his own troubled economy after the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. 
</P>
<P>
"First you go to Kuwait, then you go to Bahrain," he said of another oil-rich 
Persian Gulf kingdom without a strong military force to defend itself against 
invaders. "If Hussein takes Kuwait, it means millions (of dollars) a day in oil 
revenue that would be Iraqi money. . . . It's the money, the oil and the 
dollar, that's why Iraq and Iran went to war. And that's why Iraq invaded 
Kuwait. It's the same story." 
</P>
<P>
Tareef Nashashibi, 32, of Anaheim said he managed to get a telephone line at 
1:30 a.m. Thursday to his brother-in-law, who lives near the Sha'ab Palace, 
ministry building in the Kuwaiti capital that was reported in flames later in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
"They have heard gunshots and planes, and my brother-in-law had to evacuate his 
apartment at one point," said Nashashibi, a general contractor who has been 
living in Orange County since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also got a telephone call through to a cousin in Salwa, a suburb of 
the capital, who said there were reports of fighting in the streets and the 
sound of planes overhead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very sketchy right now, we're not sure what is going on," Nashashibi 
said. "They can hear shooting, and they can hear some bombs, but nobody knows 
exactly what the situation is. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in Kuwait didn't know about (the invasion) until they got 
telephone calls from the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Nashashibi said he was relieved that relatives appear to be unharmed 
but was warily monitoring news reports and keeping in touch with a network of 
friends and relatives throughout the Middle East, Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Since everybody's OK, it has calmed us down a little bit. But you get worried. 
. . . It's a very volatile situation. Kuwait does not have a lot of guns and 
ammunition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several natives of Kuwait described Hussein as a madman, yet they said they 
bear no ill will toward the Iraqi people. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot stereotype (the people) because of some political maneuvers on the 
part of the government," Sbaita said. 
</P>
<P>
But Nashashibi echoed the weariness of many Arabs at the relentless conflicts 
in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had enough bloodshed in the region," he said. "Enough of brother 
shooting brother."

<P>
Authorities are investigating allegations that an Irvine-based property 
management company misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars in reserve 
funds from a homeowner association in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The Rocking Horse Ridge Homeowners Assn., representing a 286-home gated 
community, filed a report with police June 23, after $260,000 was discovered 
missing from the association's reserve account, which is managed by the Balboa 
Management Co. in Irvine, said Irvine police investigator Mark Hoffman. Irvine 
police and the Orange County Sheriff's Department are jointly conducting the 
investigation. According to Hoffman, between five and 40 other homeowner groups 
may have been affected. He declined to name the others. 
</P>
<P>
Police have not yet determined if there was any wrongdoing by the company or 
any of its employees, said Hoffman, who described the investigation as 
"preliminary." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard Olson said the company is "is 
cooperating fully with investigators." 
</P>
<P>
The association has turned over records of canceled checks, bank statements and 
bank signature cards to the police. 
</P>
<P>
Rocking Horse Ridge homeowners pay about $125 a month in association fees to 
Balboa Management. The money is used for security, landscaping and pool 
maintenance, and some went into a reserve account to pay for major repairs and 
improvements in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
According to a July report from a special Rocking Horse homeowner association 
audit and accounting committee, "financial irregularities" were evident dating 
"well back into 1989." The most notable irregularity was $60,000 from 
September, 1989, according to the report. The committee also reported that no 
audit had been done in 1989 on association accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"Current known discrepancies represent a loss to the association of $260,000," 
the committee report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Balboa Management Co. owner Dennis Sellers said the association's allegations 
"bother us greatly," but referred all further questions to the company's 
attorney, Victor Sherman. Sherman refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Rocking Horse Ridge board of directors also declined to comment 
on the investigation, saying they were instructed by their attorney to keep 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
Many Rocking Horse Ridge residents are irate that the board did not order an 
audit earlier, and that the money apparently was not insured by a fiduciary 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
"The board was elected and is responsible for the way the association is run," 
said Mike Nash, a homeowner in Rocking Horse Ridge. "It's very difficult to 
check on what's happening to your money. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want our money back," he said.

MORE MONEY ASKED FOR INDIGENT CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nine months of grappling with major issues in health care, a county task 
force suggested some solutions this week, including more money for community 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the issues in improving access of the poor to medical care must be 
resolved in Orange County, others in Sacramento, said state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who organized and chaired the Orange County 
Coalition for Health Care Solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson noted that the recommendations "represent a majority opinion of the 
members -- not necessarily a complete consensus." The 16-member group's 
suggestions included: 
</P>
<P>
* Asking the Board of Supervisors to provide more money to local community 
clinics and consider "initiating county-operated clinics" to serve the poor. 
Currently, the county provides prenatal care and health screenings for children 
but does not offer general medical service to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
* Encouraging arrangements between obstetricians, prenatal clinics and 
hospitals for prenatal care for indigent women. Hospitals that accept Medi-Cal 
are deluged with poor women at time of delivery who have had no prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
* Having Orange County declared an "open area" in the Medi-Cal system. Such a 
procedure would scrap the current method in which some local hospitals sign 
state contracts, agreeing to take indigent patients at a discounted rate. 
Instead, every local hospital would take some poor patients. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, whose vice chairman was Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, included 
an unusual mix of private and public leaders, some of whom had never met. They 
included hospital administrators, doctors, health care advocate Ellen Severoni, 
county Health Care Agency director Tom Uram and Clifford Allenby, secretary of 
California's Health and Welfare Agency. The task force is to continue this year 
as an advisory body to county supervisors. LANIE JONES

KURDISH CONGRESS TO DISCUSS RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 delegates of the Kurdish National Congress of North America will 
meet this weekend to discuss human rights violations they say are taking place 
daily against Kurds in Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, which will be attended by representatives from the 
United States, Canada and parts of Europe, is scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m. 
on Saturday at the Griswold Hotel, 1500 Raymond Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The conference ends Sunday at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Kurds are descendants of the ancient Medes and make up the fourth largest group 
of people in the Middle East. The number of Kurds in Southern California is 
growing, said Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Orange County Human 
Relations Commission, who will address the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Other speakers at the conference include U.S. Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego), 
Magdaleno Rose-Avila, western regional director of Amnesty International, and 
Fullerton Councilwoman Molly McClanahan. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a learning experience for me," said Bates. "The Kurds have been the 
victim of gross human rights violations. In particular, the Iran-Iraqi war has 
been particularly hard on this group." 
</P>
<P>
Rose-Avila said he will be focusing on Amnesty International's recent World 
Report to illustrate the severity of Kurd persecution. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kurds have historically been the victims of harsh government oppression 
and human rights abuse," said Rose-Avial. "It was the Kurds who were the 
victims of chemical warfare during the Iran-Iraqi war. My daughter has a 
birthday party on Saturday, but I'm giving up a little of that time to address 
the Kurds. That's how important I think this event is."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; 
</P>
<P>
ROAD EXTENSION IS OPENED TO TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new hope for commuters struggling with traffic congestion on the Costa Mesa 
Freeway was unveiled by city and county officials Thursday with fanfare and a 
dash of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, a 5-mile extension of Jamboree Road was opened to commuters 
Thursday. The $30-million addition stretches from Irvine Boulevard in Tustin to 
Santiago Canyon Road in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next year, officials plan to extend the road even farther, through 
the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. Jamboree Road, originally a wagon trail 
through the hills, will eventually run from Balboa Island in Newport Beach 
through the Marine base, providing an alternative to the frequently jammed 
Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't take long for the word to get out that this is a good shortcut, which 
is what we want," said Tustin City Manager William A. Huston. "We want the 
traffic to be distributed better." 
</P>
<P>
At a breakfast ceremony, officials likened the opening of the new stretch of 
Jamboree Road to the completion of the transcontinental railroad. But while the 
mood of the ceremony was festive, with an antique car race and red, white and 
blue decorations, there were also critics present. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the crowd of about 200 were eight Tustin residents carrying yellow 
signs protesting the proposed Eastern Transportation Corridor and urging 
officials to save Peters Canyon Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the concern about the transportation corridor nor the concern about 
development of the park area is related to the Jamboree Road extension. But the 
protesters used the gathering to sound an alarm about rapid development of 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to save our canyons," said Margarita Clayton of Cowan Heights. "We 
don't want a freeway through here."

VAN DRIVER HELD IN ALLEGED KIDNAPING

A Mexican national was arrested early Thursday on suspicion of kidnaping and 
robbing three fellow Mexican nationals whom he allegedly had agreed to smuggle 
into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Llanos, 28, of Los Mochis, Mexico, was placed in Orange County Jail with 
bail set at $50,000 after a California Highway Patrol officer stopped Llanos' 
van and discovered three men trapped inside in a hidden compartment. 
</P>
<P>
After stopping the van at 1:16 a.m. for speeding on the southbound San Diego 
Freeway at Magnolia Street, CHP Officer R. Gonzales heard screams from the 
back. Upon checking further, he found the three victims stuffed in a 
compartment beneath a plywood platform covered by boxes, Fountain Valley Police 
Sgt. Larry Griswold said. 
</P>
<P>
In questioning the men, Griswold said, Gonzales found that they had agreed to 
pay $450 each for Llanos to smuggle them from Tijuana to Los Angeles last 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But when they arrived in Los Angeles only one of the three had enough money to 
pay Llanos, Griswold said. So all three were allegedly beaten and kept locked 
in a garage until Wednesday night, when Llanos loaded them in the van to drive 
them back to Mexico, Griswold said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, ranging in ages from 21 to 27, were detained by Fountain Valley 
police until later Thursday morning when they were bound over to the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service for immigration proceedings. JIM CARLTON

POSTSCRIPT: MODJESKA CANYON'S RAGE SOFTENS INTO RAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
MODJESKA CANYON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, tiny Modjeska Canyon was in near-revolt over the town's 
centerpiece, a century-old home that once belonged to Shakespearean actress 
Madame Helena Modjeska. 
</P>
<P>
The county bought the 14-acre property for $1 million in 1986, and promptly 
launched plans to turn it into a museum. Residents were grateful to have the 
land protected from development, but many were outraged by the county's 
proposal for operating the facility once renovations were complete. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about noise, traffic and safety along narrow Modjeska Canyon Road, 
which snakes through olive groves and back into the heart of the 180-home 
community, some townspeople threatened to chain themselves to bulldozers to 
keep the project from breaking ground. 
</P>
<P>
Others, more temperate, talked of legal action and vigorously denounced plans 
for the Modjeska Home and the nearby Fleming Property, which is also being 
developed by the county as a park. 
</P>
<P>
So imagine the happy surprise county officials got this month when the Modjeska 
Canyon Newsletter proclaimed in a banner headline: "County Parks Does Great Job 
on Fleming Property." 
</P>
<P>
"Hats off to the planners on this one," the newsletter editors wrote. "Their 
efforts have been outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
For Kathie Matsuyama, the county's project manager, words of praise were long 
in coming from the canyon residents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's come out really well," she said Thursday. "There were some doozy meetings 
there for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, settlement has come slowly to the issue, and at least one point 
continues to provide some sparks: Residents of the independent community would 
like to see the park closed either Saturdays or Sundays, but the county insists 
on keeping it open all weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Still, both sides have given ground, and what was once a raging controversy 
seems now to have settled into a low-key argument. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty good after all that," said Greg Bates, a community resident who 
was involved in many of the early discussions regarding the property. "Assuming 
that they do the things they say they'll do, I think it's going to work out." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon residents are particularly pleased with plans to limit the number of 
parties that can be held on the property and with a proposed museum shuttle-bus 
and reservation service that will hold down the number of cars using the canyon 
road. Under the county's operating plan, no visitors will be allowed to use the 
museum unless they already have reservations, and to get to the facility they 
will have to park their cars at the end of the road and be shuttled in by bus. 
</P>
<P>
Some exceptions will be made for rangers and handicapped people, but for the 
most part, cars won't be parking at the center or using the road to it. 
</P>
<P>
Those requirements are part of the county's draft environmental impact report, 
which will probably be completed this month, Matsuyama said. After that, 
residents will have time to respond to the report, both in writing and at a 
public meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Once that comment period is complete, Matsuyama said, the plan will be 
forwarded to the county Planning Commission and the Harbors, Beaches and Parks 
Commission. Approval, she added, could come as soon as November. 
</P>
<P>
That will still leave 18 months of planning and building improvements on the 
two properties, but, barring unforeseen holdups, the park should be in 
operation by early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't always been easy," Matsuyama said Thursday. "But it's pleasing to 
know that people are real happy with how hard we've worked on this. It's going 
to make a really nice place."

OFFICER TEACHING MOTORCYCLE CLASS INJURED BY PICKUP

<TEXT>
<P>
A Fullerton police officer who instructs other officers throughout the county 
on how to ride police motorcycles was critically injured Thursday when he was 
hit by a truck while teaching a class, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer William Donald Kendricks, 33, was on a training ride with 16 of his 
students when the 1:30 p.m. accident occurred, Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy 
Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old youth from Newport Beach was driving a 1990 GMC pickup truck 
north on Newport Boulevard near Hospital Road when he made an illegal right 
turn from the center lane and cut in front of Kendricks and another officer, 
Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
"One officer was able to swerve to the left and avoid the truck (but Kendricks) 
veered to the right and was hit," Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred next to Hoag Hospital, but paramedics transported 
Kendricks by helicopter to the trauma unit at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, 
Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old boy was cited for an illegal right turn, Gonis said.

<P>
Police on Thursday announced the arrest of four men, including a father and 
son, and two juveniles in connection with a gang-related, drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were arrested Monday morning shortly after five rounds were fired 
from a van at a house in the 300 block of Florence Court, La Habra police 
spokeswoman Cindy Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a gang-related shooting, a retaliation against another gang," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested on suspicion of shooting at an inhabited dwelling were Roberto Luna, 
42; his 18-year-old son, Leonard J. Luna; Agapo Acosta, 25; and Jose Guadalupe 
Esquivel, 19. The names of the two juveniles, both 16, were not released 
because of their age. All the suspects are from La Habra.

JURORS AWARD $2.5 MILLION TO VICTIM'S PARENTS

<P>
An Irvine couple won $2.5 million in damages Thursday against a man who hit and 
killed their 20-year-old daughter in a traffic crash on Laguna Canyon Road five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
After a monthlong trial before Superior Court Judge David G. Sills, jurors 
awarded that amount to Bob and Sheri Hill, according to their attorney, Wylie 
Aitken. 
</P>
<P>
Their daughter, Lorraine Hill, was killed instantly on April 27, 1985, when a 
pickup truck sideswiped her car about 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors found that the truck's driver, Glenn Barnhill, 29, of Florida, was 
guilty of gross negligence. Barnhill, formerly of Laguna Beach, had been 
drinking at a party and was on his way home when he wandered out of his lane 
and struck Hill, who was headed home from her job as a waitress in Corona del 
Mar, Aitken said. Barnhill suffered bruises in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Barnhill was acquitted of drunk-driving charges, Aitken said. In the civil 
case, Barnhill's attorney argued that the crash was Hill's fault because she 
had swerved out of her lane and struck Barnhill, Aitken said. 
</P>
<P>
Barnhill's lawyer could not be reached for comment after the verdict was 
announced. The damages were assessed against Barnhill and Bear Automotive Inc., 
a company owned by his father, Aitken said. Barnhill was driving a company 
truck when the accident happened. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's parents also named the state of California as a defendant, because the 
road had been narrowed and its median eliminated while state workers were 
laying sewer pipe in the area, Aitken said. Jurors absolved the state of any 
blame, Aitken said.

TEAM TENNIS: LOSS TO SAN ANTONIO DIMS NEWPORT BEACH PLAYOFF HOPES.

Dominating the late sets of the match, the San Antonio Racquets defeated the 
Newport Beach Dukes, 27-20, in a Team Tennis match Thursday in front of about 
300 at the John Wayne Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
The loss put the Dukes (7-5) into fourth place in the four-team West division 
and in danger of missing the playoffs. Three teams from the division qualify 
for the playoffs. The Los Angeles Strings (11-1) have clinched first place and 
a playoff spot. The Racquets (8-4) are tied with the Sacramento Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Each team has two matches remaining. The Dukes play host to the Strings at 7 
tonight and then meet the Capitals in Sacramento Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes had beaten the Racquets, 24-22, in San Antonio last month, but in 
that match the Dukes' men opened the match with 6-2 victories in men's doubles 
and men's singles. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the Racquets' Sammy Giammalva turned around the singles score, 
defeating Roger Smith, 6-2, and giving the Racquets a 21-16 lead going into the 
final set. 
</P>
<P>
Despite brief moments of decent doubles play, Smith and Marty Davis couldn't 
make up the deficit. Davis and Smith each lost their first serve in the set and 
although they broke the Racquets' team of Giammalva and Dacio Campos twice to 
tie the score, 3-3, the Dukes lost, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Frazier, who entered the match with the best women's singles record in Team 
Tennis, kept the Dukes in the match. She defeated Elna Reinach in singles, 6-4. 
But because of an injury Sophie Amiach suffered in the Dukes' 6-2 women's 
doubles loss in the first set of the match, Frazier played in Amiach's mixed 
doubles spot. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a saint," Dukes Coach Greg Patton said. "Whatever the call is, she'll go 
out and do it." 
</P>
<P>
Frazier's mixed doubles play was solid. Even so, Frazier and her partner Marty 
Davis were taken to a tiebreaker by Giammalva and Elna Reinach before winning 
the set, 6-5 (5-2 in the tiebreaker). After the mixed doubles victory, the 
Dukes trailed 15-14. 
</P>
<P>
In women's singles, it was a battle on the baselines as Frazier and Reinach 
matched groundstrokes. Neither player ever went to the net in the set. More 
often than not Frazier prevailed, using her two-hand backhand down the line at 
crucial moments.

<P>
Several new faces graced the dais at Thursday's Big West Conference football 
media day, but coaches and media expect the same old mugs -- those of the 
Fresno State Bulldogs -- to be atop the conference standings in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State, the two-time defending conference and California Raisin Bowl 
champion, finished first in the media and coaches' polls, collecting 49 of 60 
first-place media votes and five of eight first-place coaches' votes. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State was ranked second in both polls, and Utah State and Cal State 
Fullerton were ranked third and fourth, respectively, by the media and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State, which was 11-1, 7-0 in conference last season, returns seven 
starters from a defense that allowed the fewest yards and points in the 
conference in 1989. The Bulldogs also return two potent offensive starters in 
tailback Aaron Craver and quarterback Mark Barsotti. 
</P>
<P>
Craver, a 6-foot, 215-pound senior, set a school record of 1,313 yards rushing 
last season, his first in Division I after transfering from El Camino Community 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Barsotti, who will be a junior this fall, has started all 24 games in the past 
two seasons, leading Fresno State to a 21-3 record. He completed 138 of 262 
passes for 1,987 yards and 15 touchdowns and rushed for 244 yards in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State has a new coach, Terry Shea -- one of four first-year coaches in 
the Big West. The Spartans have plenty of returning starters, including junior 
running back Sheldon Canley, who rushed for 1,201 yards in '89. Canley was an 
all-conference, first-team selection last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans return seven starters each on offense and defense and should be 
especially strong on defense behind linebackers Lyneil Mayo and Everett 
Lampkins and safety Hesh Colar, whom Shea says may also play flanker. "It 
doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Fresno State and San Jose 
State are the top teams in the conference," Cal State Fullerton Coach Gene 
Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
It also doesn't take a genius to figure out that, with the possible exception 
of Utah State, no other Big West team is capable of challenging Fresno State 
and San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
And the conference coaches are quick to point this out. A sampling of comments: 
</P>
<P>
First-year New Mexico State Coach Jim Hess, who inherited an 0-11 team: "We're 
not a very good football program right now. Our president and athletic director 
are making strides to get better, but we're not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
First-year Cal State Long Beach Coach George Allen: "I don't think there's a 
Division I team in the country that needs defensive linemen more than we do." 
</P>
<P>
First-year Nevada Las Vegas Coach Jim Strong: "We may start eight or 10 true 
freshmen, but you've got to start somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who is entering his 11th season as Fullerton's coach: "The strength of 
our team is our kicker -- really." 
</P>
<P>
Utah State's Chuck Shelton was about the only other coach, besides Fresno 
State's Jim Sweeney and Shea of San Jose State, to express optimism. The Aggies 
return eight starters on defense and five on offense and have six community 
college transfers who are expected to contribute immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"We are welcoming the most veteran squad in terms of minutes played that we 
have had in the five years I've been at Utah State," Shelton said. "Our size 
and strength is good defensively, and offensively, the line is the best we've 
had in years and we've improved our running game." 
</P>
<P>
Big West Notes 
</P>
<P>
The California Raisin Bowl, which pits the winners of the Big West and 
Mid-American conferences, has signed a contract with the Big West through the 
1993 season, Commissioner Jim Haney announced Thursday. Neale Stoner, executive 
director of the bowl, said 17,000 tickets already have been sold for the 1990 
game -- 3,000 ahead of last year's pace. . . . Two former Orange County high 
school quarterbacks, Troy Kopp and David Henigan, will battle for the starting 
job at Pacific. Kopp, a Mission Viejo graduate who was drafted by the Montreal 
Expos in the 12th round of the June baseball draft, started nine games last 
season, completing 138 of 241 passes for 1,510 yards and 11 touchdowns. 
Henigan, a Fountain Valley graduate, started three games and played in eight, 
completing 86 of 159 passes for 835 yards and three touchdowns. However, a 
shoulder injury sustained in spring practice might hurt Henigan's chances. . . 
. David Chisum, who played at Sunny Hills High and Fullerton College, heads 
into practice as the starting quarterback on New Mexico State's depth chart. . 
. . The Pacific women's volleyball team received eight first-place votes and 
was picked by coaches to win the conference. The Tigers are expected to start 
two former county players, junior middle blocker Sharon Kasser of Huntington 
Beach High and junior outside hitter Heather Schoeny of Capistrano Valley High. 
Cal State Fullerton was picked to finish sixth in the conference.

The bad news for Angel pitchers was that Bob Welch was on the mound for the 
Oakland Athletics. It meant Ron Hassey, Welch's personal catcher, was going to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Now that might not strike fear in the heart of most pitchers. Hassey, after 
all, was hitting only .202 at the start of Thursday night's game at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Against Angel pitchers, however, those type of numbers don't seem to apply. 
This season and throughout his career, Hassey has hit the Angels and hit them 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night was no exception. Hassey had two hits in five at-bats, including 
a solo home run, in the Athletics' 7-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Hassey, 37, is hitting .474 against the Angels this season and has a career 
average of .307 against them. His fifth-inning home run was the second against 
them this season and the ninth of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why I hit them so well," said Hassey, an 11-year veteran. "It's 
just one of those things. Heck, if I knew why, I'd do it against every team." 
</P>
<P>
The one thing Hassey did know was that he would be in the starting lineup 
because it was Welch's turn to pitch. The two have been inseparable for almost 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In 53 of Welch's last 55 starts, Hassey has been his catcher. It was a role 
thrust upon him by the Athletic coaching staff in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
That was Welch's first year in the American League and because Terry Steinbach, 
the A's regular catcher, was a rookie, pitching coach Dave Duncan believed it 
would be better if the veteran, Hassey, caught Welch. 
</P>
<P>
"Terry didn't know the personnel in the league at that time, so we felt Ron's 
experience would help Bob," Duncan said. "It's worked out fine, so we've stayed 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
Hassey also has helped Welch stay under control at times. Thursday, he visited 
the mound twice in the early innings when Welch was in trouble and settled down 
the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had two runners on in the first inning, but Welch got out of it by 
striking out Lee Stevens. Welch also gave up two hits in the third, but the 
Angels failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
Welch went 5 1/3 innings for his 17th victory, tops in the American League. 
Welch is 33-11 during the two seasons with Hassey as his catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Hassey's presence in the lineup was an offensive benefit as well. In the fifth, 
he homered into the right-field seats to give the Athletics a 7-0 lead. He also 
singled in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"Some players just hit certain teams," Duncan said. "I don't know why Ron hits 
the Angels. I'm just glad he does." 
</P>
<P>
Hassey has seen a little more action lately than his one-every-five-games 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbach missed 24 games in July because of a pulled muscle. So Hassey and 
Jamie Quirk shared time at catcher. Hassey might have played more, but his 
knees wouldn't allow it. Eleven-plus years behind the plate have taken a toll. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hassey has been effective at the plate. He has 11 hits in his past 35 
at-bats with two home runs and eight runs batted in.

IRVIN HEEDS DICKERSON'S ADVICE AND SIGNS WITH LIONS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: FORMER RAM CORNERBACK IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT DETROIT'S CHANCES OF 
WINNING.

<P>
Advice from good friend Eric Dickerson persuaded cornerback LeRoy Irvin to sign 
a one-year contract with the Detroit Lions Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking with Eric (Wednesday) before I came in and he said, 'The Lions 
are gonna win, the Lions are gonna win,' " Irvin said. "He was telling me that 
a week ago." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin said his desire to play for a winning team played a large role in his 
decision to sign with the Lions. The former All-Pro was a member of eight 
playoff teams in his 10 years with the Rams and played in the 1985 and 1989 NFC 
Championship games. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams did not protect Irvin, 32, who served a month-long league suspension 
last season for drug abuse. He was passed over by other teams under the NFL's 
Plan B free agency system before the Rams released him April 17. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin said he worked out with San Francisco, Miami, Kansas City and Atlanta in 
addition to his July 23 workout with the Lions. All but San Francisco offered 
Irvin a contract, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tired of the traveling," Irvin said. "It was time to do something. When 
I went to other teams, I kept telling my agent 'I want to come to Detroit, I 
want to come to Detroit.' 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Coach (Wayne) Fontes before I left and he said he hoped I'd be 
back. He's not like a normal coach. You can go up and talk with him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Fontes: "To get a young man of LeRoy's caliber shows you the direction our 
program is taking. He has tremendous experience. We want to build with young 
players, but if you can get a player of Pro Bowl caliber to help your young 
kids along you take him. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to come here now." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin was one of the NFL's premier defensive backs in 1985 and 1986 when he was 
selected to the NFC Pro Bowl team. 
</P>
<P>
But his career stalled last season when he was suspended. Irvin said he has 
stayed clean since. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wrong," Irvin said. "I made a mistake. All my life, I didn't want my 
family to know about some of the things I'd done. I feel I've paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
I don't foresee myself getting into trouble now. With the help of the good Lord 
I'll make it. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin, who has intercepted 34 passes in 143 games, ranks third on the Rams' 
all-time list. He has returned five interceptions and four punts for 
touchdowns. In 1989, Irvin had three interceptions.

PICKETS RALLY AT ESTATE OF S&amp;L FIGURE;

<P>
DEMONSTRATION: ABOUT 40 PEOPLE GATHER IN FRONT OF BILL WATERS' HOME, SAYING 
TAXPAYERS SHOULDN'T BE STUCK WITH BILL FOR THE THRIFT CRISIS.

<P>
About 40 frustrated taxpayers demonstrated Thursday evening in front of the 
$1.9-million estate of Bill Walters, a key figure in the collapse of a Denver 
savings and loan, saying they were angry about footing the bill for the 
nation's S&amp;L crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, a Denver developer and former business associate of Neil Bush, 
defaulted on $96 million in loans from the now defunct Silverado Banking, 
Savings &amp; Loan. The thrift's collapse -- which authorities blame in part on 
Walters -- is expected to cost taxpayers $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters gathered in front of the gated estate of Walters and his wife, 
Jacqueline, filling the exclusive neighborhood with the sound of loud chants 
such as: "What do we want? Our money back! When do we want it? Now!" 
</P>
<P>
They also carried signs bearing messages that read: "No More Swilling at the 
Public Trough" and "Is Bill Hiding Behind the Bushes?" 
</P>
<P>
"We could fit my little condo in their garage," said protester Barbara Lo Bue, 
51, a Laguna Niguel teacher. "This makes me so angry." 
</P>
<P>
Added Ken Balter, 62, a retired Santa Ana businessman: "If I were to walk into 
a savings and loan with a gun and ask for all the money they had in the drawer, 
I'd go to jail. These guys didn't have a gun, but they did the same thing and 
they're not going to jail." 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has refused to say whether Walters is the target of any 
investigation. He has not been charged with any wrongdoing in connection with 
the collapse of the Denver thrift. 
</P>
<P>
A man answering the driveway intercom at the Walters home said: "I'm sorry, 
there's no comment right now." He said Walters was not at home. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, 44, had told the House Banking Committee in June that he was broke but 
"staying alive for another day so that I can pay every dime back if I can." 
</P>
<P>
The Times first reported two weeks ago that Walters was living in grand style 
in Orange County. Besides the Newport Beach estate, Walters' wife owns a 
$250,000 mobile home on prime oceanfront property near Laguna Beach and a 
$1-million desert retreat in the exclusive Vintage Club in Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of the Walters' lifestyle has fueled outrage on both Capitol Hill 
and Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I was screaming and ranting and raving about this savings and loan fraud and 
what it's going to cost the country, and I told my daughter no one was doing 
anything about it," said Janice Graham, a retired Laguna Hills schoolteacher 
and the rally's organizer. "She said, 'Well, you aren't doing anything either.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Graham, 54, said she called everyone from the National Organization for Women 
to senior citizens at Leisure World looking for protesters. 
</P>
<P>
KABC radio talk show host Bill Press -- along with a local newspaper columnist 
-- were encouraging people to show up at Walters' home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this (the savings and loan crisis) is the greatest heist in the 
history of American bank robberies, and it's the American people who have to 
pay the price. The American people should be outraged," Press said. "This 
demonstration is the way to get the attention of the executive and legislative 
branches." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) asked Walters in a July 26 letter to reappear 
before Congress on Sept. 6 to explain his lifestyle. The chairman of the House 
Financial Institutions subcommittee set a deadline of yesterday for Walters to 
come forward voluntarily. Walters did not respond, so Annunzio said Thursday he 
will now seek a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, real estate sources say Walters may be moving. Prudential California 
Realty has apparently been given an opportunity to sell the Newport Beach home. 
The asking price was not available Thursday, and agents there refused to 
comment.

FDA DECISION COULD BE BOON FOR TRIMEDYNE

Trimedyne Inc. is hoping to revive its flagging laser sales after receiving 
federal government approval to market a laser product for use in a new surgical 
procedure for removing gallbladders. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is this breathes new life into laser sales for us," said Pete 
Escallier, Trimedyne's marketing director, about the Food and Drug 
Administration's approval last Friday of the company's laser procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne originally developed its so-called "hot-tip" laser for opening 
clogged arteries in the leg and heart. In 1987, the Trimedyne laser was the 
first laser of any kind to win FDA approval for use in leg surgery, spurring 
brisk sales for the Tustin biomedical firm. 
</P>
<P>
But sales skidded almost to a halt after Trimedyne experienced delays in 
obtaining FDA approval for using the hot-tip laser for heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne's hot-tip laser -- also known as the Neodymium Yag laser -- has also 
encountered emerging competition from an alternative, so-called "cold laser" 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
While the hot-tip laser uses heat to evaporate fatty deposits in blood vessels, 
an alternative cold laser cuts through the plaque with short bursts of 
ultraviolet light and eliminates the heat that may damage an artery. The FDA 
has not yet approved cold lasers for opening clogged arteries. 
</P>
<P>
Blaming marketplace "confusion" over the effectiveness of its hot laser, 
Trimedyne lost $1.9 million in the quarter ended March 31 as sales plunged 70%. 
For the first six months of fiscal 1990, the company lost $2.45 million, 
contrasted with earnings of $1.5 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Escallier said physicians are showing increased interest in a new type of 
gallbladder surgery called laparoscopic cholecystectomy and that interest "is 
what is driving a lot of laser sales now." 
</P>
<P>
In this new procedure, he said, the gallbladder is severed by the laser, which 
cauterizes as it cuts, and is removed through a 1-inch incision in the abdomen 
rather than the 6- to 8-inch incision required with traditional gallbladder 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
He said the new technique typically allows patients to leave the hospital in 
one day and return to work in a week. That compares to five to seven days of 
hospitalization and three to five weeks of recuperation at home with the 
traditional procedure. 
</P>
<P>
While the new gallbladder surgery can be done with alternative implements, 
Escallier said that some physicians prefer lasers because of their precision 
and ability to stop bleeding with heat. 
</P>
<P>
Escallier said some hospitals already had been placing orders for Trimedyne's 
hot-tip laser in anticipation of last week's FDA approval. 
</P>
<P>
He said lasers supplied by other manufacturers have also received FDA approval 
for use in gallbladder surgery, but that Trimedyne's is the only one also 
approved for leg surgery. FDA officials were unavailable Thursday to confirm 
Trimedyne's claim. 
</P>
<P>
Escallier said Trimedyne has also obtained FDA approval to use its hot laser 
for about a dozen other non-vascular surgical procedures, including general 
surgery, gynecology and urology. 
</P>
<P>
He said the new uses for the Trimedyne laser will give greater leverage to 
surgeons trying to persuade hospital administrators to purchase the $100,000 
piece of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne expects within 45 days to receive similar approval from the FDA to 
market a newer-model laser for gallbladder surgery, Escallier said. He said 150 
of those models have been sold by Trimedyne.

WESTERN DIGITAL FINANCE CHIEF MOYER GIVES NOTICE; 
</P>
<P>
MANAGEMENT: HE DENIES HIS DECISION WAS INFLUENCED BY THE RECENT PROMOTION OF 
ANOTHER SENIOR TOP EXECUTIVE TO THE COMPANY'S NO. 2 JOB.

Western Digital Corp. said Thursday that its chief financial officer, A. J. 
(Bert) Moyer, will resign at the end of the month "to pursue other business 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Moyer's announcement comes a week after the Irvine computer products company 
promoted Kathryn Braun from senior vice president to the newly created post of 
executive vice president for operations, essentially the firm's No. 2 job. 
</P>
<P>
Before her appointment, Braun and Moyer were two of four senior vice presidents 
at Western Digital. 
</P>
<P>
Some company insiders and analysts have speculated that Braun's appointment 
puts her in line to succeed Roger W. Johnson as chief executive of the firm. 
However, Johnson, who also serves as chairman and president, has not announced 
any plans to leave the company. 
</P>
<P>
But Moyer said Thursday that his departure "is not tied to (Braun's 
appointment) at all. It's not antagonistic at all." 
</P>
<P>
Moyer said the decision was personal and that he has been contemplating the 
move for some time. He said he postponed the decision until after the company 
reported its annual financial results last week. The resignation is effective 
Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to spending time with my family and smelling the roses," 
Moyer said. "I have no business plans at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also said Moyer's parting was amicable. He said Moyer's job will be 
filled temporarily after Sept. 1 by H. Richard Byrne, corporate controller and 
chief accounting officer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sorry to see him go, and he has done a very good job," Johnson said. 
"We'll miss him, but we have a capable acting replacement in Dick Byrne." 
</P>
<P>
Moyer joined Western Digital in February, 1986, from Enhansys Inc., a small 
Silicon Valley computer software firm where he served as chief executive.

WORK FORCE CUT BY 35 AT ALPHA MICROSYSTEMS

Alpha Microsystems, a maker of business computer systems, said Thursday it has 
cut 9% of its work force, or 35 people, as part of a restructuring to reduce 
costs in the face of a downturn in the minicomputer market. 
</P>
<P>
John S. Cain, president of Alpha Microsystems, said the company will also close 
its PICK operating system product research and development unit in San Jose and 
move the staff of 10 employees to the firm's Santa Ana headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
As another part of the restructuring, the company will combine its sales staffs 
for three different product lines into a single marketing group headed by 
Douglas Tullio, executive vice president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
The company will also combine elements of its international sales force with 
the domestic sales group. Cain said the company would attempt to further reduce 
operating costs by implementing stronger expense controls. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the minicomputer business, and for years it has been under attack 
from the top by cheaper mainframe computers and on the bottom by improved 
personal computers," he said. "This restructuring allows us to more tightly 
focus our efforts on strengthening our competitive position. We continue to 
offer all products at competitive prices." 
</P>
<P>
Cain said he could not forecast how the restructuring will affect the company's 
earnings for the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter ended May 27, the company reported a loss of $2.4 million 
on sales of $13.5 million, compared to net income of $579,000 on sales of $14.1 
million during the same period last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody has their own way of looking at contemporary art. Some peer through 
parted fingers, stopping just long enough to draw an instant conclusion before 
rushing off to the next piece. Others stand for hours before a single work, 
staring wide-eyed as they struggle with a thousand conflicting interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing Without Eyes," a traveling exhibit now at the Fullerton Museum Center, 
offers yet another view, inviting sighted and non-sighted visitors to "see" 10 
works of contemporary art through their sense of touch. The exhibit, which 
opened Saturday and continues through Aug. 26, was organized by Corinne Gillett 
Horowitz, curator of education for the University Art Museum at UC Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz created "Seeing" with a dual purpose: to make contemporary art more 
accessible to the visually impaired, and to familiarize sighted audiences with 
the ways the blind and partially sighted use their sense of touch to experience 
art and their environment. 
</P>
<P>
Each work is encased in a wooden box, closed on one side with a small, black 
curtain and on the other with a sheet of plexiglass. Audiences are invited to 
part the curtains and "see" each piece with their hands, running their 
fingertips across the surface of a polished wood carving, wrapping their palms 
around the curve of a 
</P>
<P>
porcelain vase, contrasting the slick, cool touch of a bronze abstract to the 
prickly texture of a pine-needle basket. Sighted viewers can then step to the 
other side of the box and see how accurate their sense of touch really was. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the works on display are by artists from the Santa Barbara area, 
Horowitz said, and all were created for or loaned to the exhibit with the 
non-sighted audience in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"The artists chose their pieces for their tactile quality; smooth or rough 
surfaces, gypsum cement and porcelain versus pine needles," Horowitz said. "It 
was intended to be challenging to the fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, I've found that it works very well with a variety of audiences -- 
children, adults, people who see, people who don't see -- because it appeals to 
our basic senses." 
</P>
<P>
To make "Seeing" even more accessible to the visually impaired, the show 
features gallery cards in conventional type and in Braille. Invitations to the 
Fullerton show were sent to all of the county's major centers for the visually 
impaired, and representatives of Anaheim's Braille Institute briefed museum 
docents on their clients' needs. The museum is also offering free admission to 
the exhibit to non- or partially sighted visitors. 
</P>
<P>
For the sighted, "Seeing" offers yet another vantage point. When a slow, 
careful examination of a work is done with your fingers, rather than your eyes, 
it's nearly impossible to make a snap decision about the visual appeal of the 
art. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, Conway Pierson's ceramic "The Anyway Anteater," which greets 
visitors at the exhibit's entrance. After you gingerly poke your hands behind 
the curtains and trace the beast's long irregular snout and stubby legs, your 
mind is too busy trying to identify the shape ("Is it an elephant? No, the ears 
are too small.") to decide whether it is "your kind of art." 
</P>
<P>
Abstracts, like Rollin Fortier's untitled bronze, leave even more to the 
imagination, letting the viewer appreciate the way its curves conform to the 
shape of the hand or the way the metal slowly warms to the touch. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz, a French woman who spent 10 years as a lecturer at the Louvre in 
Paris, said she chose to use original contemporary art in her show -- instead 
of folk art, a practice she has seen in similar exhibits -- to give the 
visually impaired the "chance to use their full abilities." 
</P>
<P>
"People who are blind have a finely developed, very delicate sense of touch," 
she said. "I felt that just using, say, quilts or baskets (which are easily 
recognizable by touch), didn't take full advantage of their tactile abilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Say you invite a blind person to your home for a meal. What are you doing to 
serve it on -- a paper plate, or china and crystal? You would use china, just 
like you would for anyone else. My feeling is that it is unfair not to give to 
the blind what you would give to a seeing person." 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing Without Eyes" continues through Aug. 26 at the Fullerton Museum 
Center, 301 N. Pomona Ave., Fullerton. Museum hours are 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays; 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Thursdays and 
Fridays. The visually impaired will be admitted free during the run of this 
show. Regular museum admission is $1 to $2, free to children under 12, and to 
visitors between 6 and 9 p.m. every Thursday. Information: (714) 738-6545.

INTERPRETER LETS HEARING-IMPAIRED AUDIENCE IN ON THE JOKE; 
</P>
<P>
COMEDY: AT NEWPORT BEACH'S LAFF STOP, PAULA DUNN USES MORE THAN JUST SIGN 
LANGUAGE TO CONVEY THE STAND-UP PERFORMERS' HUMOR TO DEAF GUESTS.

<P>
Paula Dunn doesn't mind being the butt of a few jokes. In fact, she prettymuch 
expects it when she takes the stage at the Laff Stop in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Every three months or so, the club hosts a special night for the 
hearing-impaired, giving them a chance to enjoy an evening of stand-up comedy. 
Dunn has gotten the call every time. 
</P>
<P>
Comedians have been more than generous in sharing the stage with Dunn, who will 
interpret Sunday's show, headlined by Jeff Shilling. In fact, she says, "a lot 
of them play off me and use me, so that makes it hysterical for the deaf 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
The deaf almost always need interpreters to communicate with hearing people -- 
most of whom don't know sign language -- and it is "awkward to have someone in 
on all of your business," Dunn says. "So when the interpreter gets to be the 
butt of some of the jokes, they love it." 
</P>
<P>
Each Laff Stop gig can be as much a performance for Dunn as it is for the 
comics. Whatever the comedian conveys with vocal inflection has to be delivered 
by Dunn with facial expressions and body language. Otherwise, she says, "it 
would be like just reading the information." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to take on the characteristics of the people you're signing for, as 
much as you can," Dunn says. "I have a lot of fun with it. I don't stay 
strictly in an interpreter role." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn is "absolutely wonderful," says Laff Stop manager Janis Taylor, who 
organizes the special shows with the help of a group called the Southern 
California Recreation Assn. of the Deaf. Dunn signed the first hearing-impaired 
night at the Laff Stop in March, 1988, and Taylor has insisted on using her 
every time. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very moving. They were just so thrilled," Taylor says of the first 
show, which featured Fred Greenlee. And the hearing audience, she says, was 
equally entertained: "Everybody feels like they've gotten a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor will often line up guest spots for the shows. Sunday's bill, in addition 
to scheduled middle act Dave Wilson, will also feature a set by 
hearing-impaired comic Kathy Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
There are certain kinds of comedy that don't go over well with a deaf audience, 
Dunn says. Musical references are a no-no, as are puns -- words that sound the 
same may have entirely different signs. Allusions to movies can be tricky too, 
because few are closed-captioned. 
</P>
<P>
Vocal impersonations usually don't go over, Dunn says, but "if they do the 
characteristics, the body movements, then it works." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn, who lives in Santa Ana, also signs some local theatrical productions. It 
is physically demanding work, she says, something she does "for free lance and 
fun." Dunn works full time as a computer operator at a center for disabled 
people. 
</P>
<P>
When she was first approached about the Laff Stop gigs, Dunn says the decision 
was easy: "I said: 'Sure, I'm a ham. Why not?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Shilling, Dave Wilson and Kathy Buckley will perform Sunday at 8:30 p.m. 
with sign-language interpreter Paula Dunn at the Laff Stop, 2122 S.E. Bristol 
St., Newport Beach. Admission: $7. Information: (714) 852-8762.

RANDY LEWIS: VIDEO REVOLUTION HAS CREATED A MONSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If Mary Shelley had been brainstorming in the summer of 1990 instead of the 
summer of 1816, I'll bet she wouldn't have made poor Victor Frankenstein go 
through all that mess of animating a corpse composed of various purloined body 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
To drive home her point about the unthinkable horrors that can grow out of 
technological progress, even when administered with the best of intentions, she 
simply could have sent the good doctor to an electronics-parts junk yard to 
concoct an even more frightening and all-invasive creature: the portable video 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
Allow me to explain. 
</P>
<P>
The video explosion indeed has revolutionized our already mind-boggling 
Information Age. In less time than it took for the telegraph to give way to the 
telephone, the newsreel of old, with its musty pictures from the battlefield 
arriving days or weeks later for audiences to ponder, has been supplanted by 
live mini-cams descending on the scene of any news event within hours, 
sometimes minutes. 
</P>
<P>
If this has been a boon in allowing us to immediately connect and empathize 
with victims of a natural disaster halfway around the world, or to witness 
momentous historical events literally as they happen, it also has become the 
bane of anyone who wishes to conduct his or her affairs out of the public 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
Excepting certain people like Richard Nixon and Ollie North who have, by their 
violation of public trust, given up any right to conduct affairs out of the 
public arena, the rest of us might reasonably expect to enjoy events without 
being subjected to prying electronic eyes. 
</P>
<P>
But the video revolution, which egalitarian minds had hoped would lead to an 
informed, enlightened and concerned citizenry, has degenerated into an arena of 
bread and circuses. To wit: When the porta-camera gave us a chance to witness 
firsthand the dismantling of the Berlin Wall last year, Americans tuned out in 
droves. Yet what is this season's surprise ratings hit on network TV? ABC's 
"America's Funniest Home Videos," which capitalizes on everyone's desire to 
play Allen Funt and to turn every aspect of life into a coast-to-coast 
sideshow. 
</P>
<P>
From actual childbirth to birthday parties, weddings and funerals, virtually 
every aspect of life has become fodder for video voyeurism. 
</P>
<P>
All of which brings us to a concert presented in Santa Ana last weekend to 
raise money for the homeless. As it turned out, the promoters claim to have 
lost $400 on the event. That's partly because the show was poorly planned and 
abysmally executed (there wasn't even so much as a cheap-o Radio Shack PA 
system for the performers). 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the fiery performance by veteran R&amp;B saxslinger Big Jay McNeely 
would have been a pleasurable enough experience in itself. But even that was 
compromised by the intrusion of not one but two self-styled David Lynches who 
set about indulging their video appetites all night long. 
</P>
<P>
McNeely is renowned as one of the most animated performers of the early rock 
era, and with his first song he was living up to his reputation, roaming not 
just the stage but the entire room, sometimes sitting in a fan's lap, other 
times falling down on one knee while continuing to blow his heart out. 
</P>
<P>
Not content to be firsthand witnesses to such a freewheeling show, the video 
freaks followed McNeely around, sweeping in from various corners of the room as 
if they were cinematographers on a Steven Spielberg film shoot. 
</P>
<P>
Get that close-up! Swing around for a side shot! Zoom in on his fingers! Now 
get the audience reaction! 
</P>
<P>
Actually, their behavior made me wonder whether these folks were really ardent 
fans of Big Jay or just waiting, 12-to-1 zooms in hand, for his pants to fall 
down so they could get big bucks and yuks from Bob Saget. 
</P>
<P>
It's appalling how any no-talent Joe with the money to plunk down for a clump 
of microchips and tape heads can quickly direct an audience's attention away 
from the rightful owner -- be it a musician, an actor, a newlywed or an amateur 
athlete -- and co-opt it for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Besides which, all this reinforces the already too-prevalent attitude that the 
only aspects of life with any validity are those that show up on the TV screen. 
</P>
<P>
Did I have a good time at the fair? How was Uncle Bob's 90th birthday? Did 
Jenny look pretty at her graduation? Gee, I won't know till I rerun the video. 
</P>
<P>
Just as evidence about the dangers of secondhand smoke shatters the myth about 
cigarettes affecting only the smoker, the video intrusion touches all of us 
sooner or later. 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, if Mary Shelley was updating her book for the '90s reader, 
she would have to come up with a new subtitle as well. Instead of referring to 
Frankenstein as "The Modern Prometheus," she could dub her video monster "The 
Modern Narcissus."

COMING THROUGH IN A PITCH; 
</P>
<P>
PAUL GELLER'S CLUTCH EFFORTS HAVE CAUSED A MOUND OF TROUBLE FOR LEGION FOES OF 
WOODLAND HILLS WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The announcement was almost enough to make a guy choke on his morning doughnut. 
Paul Geller had been told the night before that he might be called on to pitch, 
but he never figured it would be as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
A last-minute change in strategy, however, was discussed Sunday morning over 
breakfast. Geller's Woodland Hills West team needed a doubleheader sweep of 
Claremont on the final day of the 6th Area playoffs at UCLA's Jackie Robinson 
Stadium to advance to the state tournament, and many expected West right-hander 
Pat Treend to start the opener Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Geller, who usually starts at second base, figured he might pitch in relief, if 
at all. Scramble those plans: Geller would start the opener and Treend would 
pitch in the second game -- if there was one. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a wake-up call. This was as sobering as burnt coffee, and at that 
hour, not much easier for Geller to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I'd rather have a tired second baseman in the second game than a 
tired pitcher in the first one," West Coach Don Hornback said of the switch. 
"This way, Geller hadn't played an entire game before he started in the second 
one and Treend got the extra time to rest. Of course, if I had been wrong. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Even Treend -- who was sent back to the team hotel on Sunset Boulevard to get 
some additional rest -- thought it might be over early. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Pat was talking to Jeff (Marks, a West outfielder) and I don't 
think he even knew if I was there or not," Geller said, laughing. "Pat said, 
'You've got to get through the first one.' I was like, 'Great, my own teammates 
aren't even sure about this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Geller nonetheless posted a few goose eggs as West rolled to a 5-2 victory in 
the opener. West rallied behind Treend in the second game to win, 16-7, 
advancing to the state tournament, which begins Saturday in Yountville, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
It was hardly the first time Geller, in the vernacular of his teammates, 
"clutched up." The term could just as easily conjure images of hands around the 
throat in an all-out choke. But not for Geller, who all season has been the 
player applying the stranglehold. 
</P>
<P>
Against Claremont, Geller struck out seven and walked one. He did not permit an 
earned run and gave up eight hits, seven of which were singles. And this 
against a team that had defeated Treend, 8-7, in the first round of the Area 
tournament to snap West's 20-game win streak. 
</P>
<P>
"It sent chills through my spine," said Treend's father, Chuck, who attended 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hornback: "I don't think anybody pitched a better game that whole 
tournament, including the so-called real pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
Reality, it seems, has taken the summer off. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Geller was West's sacrificial lamb in the playoffs. Even though 
the team eventually won the World Series title, Geller was twice used in the 
playoffs to pitch meaningless games after West had clinched a spot in the 
championship bracket. He was 0-2 and in the showers before many fans finished 
their first fistfuls of popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
This season, armed with a cut fastball that he recently discovered while 
"messin' around in the bullpen," Geller is 5-0 with four saves and an 
earned-run average of 1.65. 
</P>
<P>
"No one really expects me to throw as hard as Treend and just mow 'em down or 
chuck it right by people," Geller said. "Even when I get hit, it's mainly 
ground balls that get through. I just try to keep it down. I just throw low and 
hit spots." 
</P>
<P>
His credentials in the field have been virtually spotless as well -- Hornback 
says Geller has made just four fielding errors at second this summer. 
Additionally, Geller more than capably filled in at shortstop for two weeks 
while teammate Gregg Sheren recovered from a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
Geller batted .406 in the regular season and had an on-base percentage of .590, 
sparking West's long win streak from the leadoff position. More important, 
however, were Geller's contributions in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
West, a team composed primarily of players from El Camino Real High, struggled 
to a 1-3 start this season. El Camino Real, a favorite to win the City Section 
4-A Division title, had stumbled in the championship game at Dodger Stadium, 
falling to Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
About the last thing many of Geller's teammates wanted to do was play more 
baseball. But Geller, a 1989 graduate of El Camino Real who tried to make the 
team at USC as a walk-on and failed, felt differently. He and teammate Del 
Marine, another '89 El Camino Real graduate who did not play college baseball 
last season, were more than ready for the summer season. 
</P>
<P>
"That (Chatsworth) loss was the beginning of a nightmare," Geller, 18, said. 
"We were so ready to come out, ready to play with all of our friends. Then we 
start 1-3 or whatever it was, people weren't showing up at practice and the 
attitude was, 'Oh well, we'll turn it around whenever.' 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling was, 'This is my last year. We're turning it around right now.' " 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Geller wasn't taking this sitting down. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the ones who had to sit out a year," teammate Jason Cohen said of 
Geller and Marine. "We came out like bums and they came out steaming." 
</P>
<P>
Geller went about effecting the turnabout by example. After El Camino Real fell 
to 1-2 in Legion play with a game with Chatsworth looming, Geller began to look 
for answers. He found it staring back at him in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to think about how I could get our team rolling," he said. "About 
two days before the (Chatsworth) game, I watched a videotape of the '88 Dodgers 
in the World Series. I was watching Mickey Hatcher, the guy they called the 
human dynamo. He was running all over, he was not pretty, but he was making 
things happen. I must have watched that six times in the days before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I went in my room the night before the game and wrote down a couple of 
notes to myself. One was from (El Camino Real Coach Mike) Maio. It said, 'It 
takes no ability to hustle.' I put that and a couple of others and put them up 
on my mirror." 
</P>
<P>
Geller then played the best defensive game of his career in West's 2-0 loss to 
Chatsworth. Geller made five eye-popping plays at second, impressing more than 
his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Their coach said after the game that it was the best game he could ever 
remember seeing a second baseman play," Hornback said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chatsworth coach, for the sake of perspective, is former major leaguer Pete 
Redfern. 
</P>
<P>
But while the team lost, it seems some of Geller's enthusiasm rubbed off. West 
immediately embarked on its 20-game win streak. 
</P>
<P>
West could again have been swamped by a midseason crisis. Starters Bobby Kim, 
Cohen, Marks and Treend went on a one-week vacation to Hawaii in the middle of 
West's hot streak. It would be left to Geller and Marine to hold things 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Pat told Del that we were only allowed to lose one game while they 
were gone," Geller said. "I think Coach Hornback would have been happy if we 
split." 
</P>
<P>
Keyed by Geller, Marine and the reserves, West went 4-0 for the week and the 
roll continued into the playoffs. West (28-5) has won 25 of its last 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the turning point in the season," Cohen said. "Bobby and I were 
calling after each game, calling Del to see how they were doing. We couldn't 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming back on a winning streak pushed the team together, made the chemistry 
that much better." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the team gelled with an assist from Del and Geller. 
</P>
<P>
"Del and I decided we had to talk it up and motivate the pups (reserves) to do 
well, and we did," Geller said. "It shows how much depth we have and how anyone 
can come in at any time and do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Geller ought to know. Next time, just give him as much advance notice as 
possible.

SYLMAR TEAM OUSTED FROM TOURNAMENT AS COURT DENIES INJUNCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sylmar Palomino all-star baseball team struck out in a San Jose courtroom 
Thursday and boarded a bus for the six-hour journey home without playing an 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
The team was deprived of competing in the western zone tournament after Santa 
Clara County Superior Court Judge Peter G. Stone rejected its bid for an 
injunction that would have suspended attempts by tournament organizers to 
disqualify the team. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar Manager Larry Kapuscinski sought the injunction after North Division 
director Abel Hernandez disqualified Sylmar, claiming its roster included 
players from too large an area. 
</P>
<P>
"I declined to interfere with the decision of the (Palomino) league," Stone 
said. "It's a real tragedy for the team and its supporters. (Organizers) should 
go through these problems and establish clear rules at the beginning of the 
season, not . . . right before the World Series." 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the six-team tournament advances to the Palomino World Series in 
Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stone, it was within the court's jurisdiction to grant the 
injunction but, in general, courts are reluctant to interfere in disputes 
involving private, nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the judge took an out," said Ted Mathewson, the San Jose attorney 
Kapuscinski had retained to handle the case. "If we had the time, the resources 
and the inclination we could appeal; there is precedent. The players had a 
contractual agreement with the league when they paid their money to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
"We contended that the roster of the team had been approved by the Coastal 
Division director pursuant to the rules. The rules clearly state that the 
division director is the one who decides the legality of the roster and he did 
that. That ends it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no provision that gives authority to the division director of another 
division." 
</P>
<P>
Kapuscinski and his players were "devastated." 
</P>
<P>
"What we are upset about is that they didn't beat us on the field," Kapuscinski 
said. "They believe we have a stacked team and we're not a stacked team. We're 
not bad, but we're not major league material." 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Tim Weir said he and his teammates have been riding an emotional 
roller coaster since their arrival in San Jose on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was pumped up (Wednesday) when we thought the court would give us a 
chance to play, but now we're all disappointed again," said Weir, a recent 
Crespi High graduate who will attend San Diego State in the fall on a baseball 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the Sylmar team has been embroiled in controversy. 
In 1988, two players were disqualified from the zone tournament because their 
homes were outside the boundaries. Two others were ruled ineligible when their 
registration forms were deemed to be incorrectly filled out and Kapuscinski's 
team was forced to leave its hotel because of complaints about noise and unruly 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The current controversy is likely to continue if Kapuscinski follows through on 
his plan to sue the national Palomino organization for travel expenses incurred 
by the players, coaches and their families. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they have a claim for breach of contract and fraud," Mathewson said. 
</P>
<P>
La Puente, which finished second to Sylmar in last weekend's regional 
tournament, will take Sylmar's place in the six-team tournament.

KARATE: PIANO FIGHTS OFF GANG CONNECTIONS TO EMERGE AS GOLD MEDALIST UNDER 
CLOSE TUTELAGE OF HOWELL.

<P>
Nestled unobtrusively near the entrance to Box Canyon in West Hills, Twin 
Dragons Martial Arts School is not the easiest place to find. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since instructor David Howell opened the school three years ago, Jimmy 
Piano, 15, has been aware of its existence. Until this year, he was just never 
in any particular hurry to get there. Piano finally found Howell in January, 
amid a school year in which he twice had to switch schools because of gang 
problems and narrowly escaped a jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I told him was there is no gang besides my gang," said Howell. 
"My gang is the only gang." 
</P>
<P>
After six months under Howell, Piano won a state championship in the white-belt 
division, and, along with 12 fellow tae kwon do students from Twin Dragons, 
qualified for the National Junior Olympics in Fort Worth, Tex. To finish off 
this would-be movie script, Piano won a gold medal in the white-belt division, 
one of a trio of Howell students to take home gold. 
</P>
<P>
For a martial arts school that has been in existence for such a short time, 
such a feat is practically unheard of. All told, six youngsters won at least 
one medal. Richie Barron, 11, of West Hills, won a silver in forms and a bronze 
in sparring; the other five -- including gold medalists Piano of Canoga Park, 
Jalaal Abdulla, 11, and Matthew Sotebeer, 8 -- won for sparring. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting because I don't stress fighting," Howell said. "I stress 
discipline, hard work, and believing in yourself. We only spar one day of the 
week, Friday. The rest of the time we work on proper technique." 
</P>
<P>
The first time Piano sparred in a full-contact tae kwon do match, he said, he 
was hit hard and yet thought nothing of it. But then Piano was not your average 
teen-aged tae kwon do neophyte. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids are scared of full-contact sparring," Piano said. "I think I 
have done well because I'm not scared. I got into trouble on the streets and 
almost went to jail, so this doesn't scare me." 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth grade at El Camino Real High, Piano hung out with a small group of 
kids who were bused in from outside the Valley. Piano would soon discover that 
they were members of the Bloods gang, that it would be unwise to befriend them. 
Piano didn't care. Soon, playing football after school turned into other 
infinitely more dangerous activities later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of months of doing "everything," according to Piano, he 
transferred to a junior high school in Chatsworth. While Piano said he was 
never a full-fledged member of the Bloods, he might as well have been. 
</P>
<P>
In the two-tone gang fiefdom -- red symbolizing the Bloods, blue the rival 
Crips -- Piano had "enemies at every school." His junior high, according to 
Piano, turned out to have a large Crips population. Two months of rumbling 
finally ended for Piano one night when a purported Crips member was beaten up, 
his clothes stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Piano was arrested and charged with misdemeanor assault and battery, despite 
his contention that the real culprit was a friend who bore a resemblance to 
him. Regardless, Piano concedes that he probably would have gone to jail were 
it not for Howell. 
</P>
<P>
A week earlier, disenchanted with a karate school in Canoga Park, Piano had 
sought out Howell with the intent of enrolling in Twin Dragons. It was at this 
time that he left the junior high in Chatsworth and began attending Coutin, a 
private school in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed to get straightened out and Mr. Howell went to the mat for me," Piano 
said. "I remember being real scared, thinking I was going to jail. I had been 
on probation but never thought I would go to jail. That's when I decided to 
start a new life." 
</P>
<P>
The court placed Piano in Howell's custody, and now Piano must report to Howell 
every day. The two have developed a close relationship, and the pride is 
visible on Howell's face when he talks about Piano. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctant to unnecessarily burden a teen-ager, Howell kept Piano's past secret 
from the other students until he was sure Piano had turned his life around. Now 
Piano, the eldest of the 13 Twin Dragons students who went to the Junior 
Olympics, finds himself in a big-brother role -- "I try to lead by example," he 
said shyly. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first met Jimmy," Howell said, "he was in a lot of trouble and he was 
failing all his classes at school. But he's a good kid, always was -- it was 
just the environment that he was brought up in. Now, six months later, he is 
passing all of them." 
</P>
<P>
Howell, raised in a predominantly Korean neighborhood in South Los Angeles, 
learned hapkido, a martial art that emphasizes flipping one's opponent through 
the air, at an early age, and earned his black belt when he was 17. 
</P>
<P>
He then turned to tae kwon do, a full-contact martial art, and went on to a 
distinguished career in which he attained the rank of second-degree black belt. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, who enjoyed a one-year career with the USFL Los Angeles Express in 
1982, has found what he wants to do for the rest of his life. He has trained 
many of the Los Angeles Raiders, including Marcus Allen. He said he has even 
turned down movie offers, including Eric Roberts' role in last year's karate 
flick, "The Best of the Best." 
</P>
<P>
"I have over 100 kids in my school, and I teach about 90 percent of them," said 
Howell, who is married and has a 3-year-old daughter. "This is what I do, this 
is what I love. I could be in a movie or coach at the national level, but then 
I would be away from my school and the kids too long. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids do what you do, not what you say. That's why my kids love me, because I 
don't tell them, I show them. I don't want to be their idol, I want to be their 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
While many karate and tae kwon do schools stress fighting, Howell, who speaks 
the language well enough to hold his own in a Korean restaurant, spends a great 
deal of time teaching his students about Korean culture. He has taught them 
some Korean words and taken most of them to a Korean restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Howell requires all students to bring in their report cards from school. Anyone 
failing a class not only is barred from testing for the next belt level but is 
given a "free, private lesson" in tae kwon do. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants one of those," said Jamie Smith, a gold medalist in the state 
championships. "Mr. Howell is a very nice teacher and he is very tough. He 
makes sure you do things right and he is very strict, but he loves you." 
</P>
<P>
While Howell is content with his lot, most of his students dream of the 1996 
Olympics. Under Howell, many have discovered what a powerful and attainable 
dream that is, but one particular student has known all along. Since he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Jimmy Piano sat in his first-grade class, writing down what he 
wanted to be when he grew up. On a piece of paper that his mom still has,

SAND, KUCHIKI MAKE A POINT DESPITE SCORE; 
</P>
<P>
FIGURE SKATING: AREA TEAM GAINS CONFIDENCE AND EXPERIENCE BUT FAILS TO IMPRESS 
JUDGES IN A CROWD-PLEASING RETURN TO THE ICE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Sand has been feeling a little better lately. As a result, Natasha 
Kuchiki, his figure skating partner, is feeling a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the top pairs team in the United States trailed three Soviet 
couples when results of the original program were tabulated Thursday at the 
Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
The scores will come later, after the international judging community gets used 
to the relatively new top team from the United States. That probably won't 
happen soon enough to help Sand and Kuchiki in the Goodwill Games -- the 
competition concludes today with the free-skating program. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still trying to establish ourselves as one of the top teams in the 
world," Sand said after the pair's marks had been taken off the board and a 
crowd of 17,429 at the Tacoma Dome stopped jeering. 
</P>
<P>
Had the judges been aware of the trials faced by Sand and Kuchiki in the past 
months, perhaps they would have been more generous. 
</P>
<P>
Sand, of Thousand Oaks, and Kuchiki, from Canoga Park, have been in full 
training for only two weeks. They were scheduled to compete at the U. S. 
Olympic Festival in Minneapolis last month, but were forced to withdraw at the 
last minute because Sand was experiencing lower-back problems. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors suggested plenty of rest. Not exactly a prescription for figure skating 
success with a major international competition a month away. 
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Sand told Kuchiki he was starting to feel like his old self, a 
comment she said "relieved" her. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, his performance spoke for itself. The couple's performance had a 
minor flaw or two, but nothing noticeable to the crowd, which roared its 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a little nervous going in, but once I started skating, I forgot about 
it," Kuchiki said. "The crowd was great." 
</P>
<P>
And, on this day, that was enough of a reward. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd knew it was a fine performance," said John Nicks, who coaches the 
pair. "We were a little disappointed in the marks, but this is still a new 
pair. Once they perform like this two or three more times in front of an 
international judging body, then we'll see those numbers go up. We're very 
happy about what happened here today." 
</P>
<P>
The Goodwill Games mark only the second international competition for Sand, 26, 
and Kuchiki, 13, who joined forces a little more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
After only eight months together, they placed second in the U.S. championships 
at Salt Lake City in February. 
</P>
<P>
In March, they placed 11th at the world championships in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
The following month, they became No. 1 -- in the United States, at least. 
</P>
<P>
Rudi Galindo and Kristi Yamaguchi, national pairs champions, separated to 
pursue singles careers. Inheriting the top spot added some pressure, Kuchiki 
said, but Nicks, who used to coach world champions Randy Gardner and Tai 
Babilonia, is confident the couple will prove that is where they belong. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still learning, but I think it was obvious today that they're becoming 
much more comfortable together," Nicks said. "They're starting to look like 
what I would call a seasoned pair of competitors." 
</P>
<P>
In the singles, Christopher Bowman of Van Nuys was sixth among eight 
competitors in the men's scoring. It is a humbling position for the 1989 
national champion, but one he said he deserved. 
</P>
<P>
"When you miss a combination, that's what happens," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman's exercise was to include a triple-lutz followed by a double-toe loop. 
Instead, he performed a single-lutz and double-toe loop. 
</P>
<P>
"The program is new and still in the development stages," Bowman said. "I've 
had trouble with it." 
</P>
<P>
Viktor Petrenko of the Soviet Union, who was second in the world championships, 
leads going into today's free-skating portion of the competition.

PLAYOFF HOPES ON THE LINE FOR HEAT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Will the Thursday disclosure that the Los Angeles Heat plans to leave the South 
Bay in turn leave its players with any fire? 
</P>
<P>
That's a question that will be answered this weekend in a crucial two-game set 
for the Orange County-bound American Professional Soccer League West team. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat trails the third-place San Diego Nomads by only a single point in the 
league's Southern Division and the teams meet Sunday at 4 p.m. at West Torrance 
High. Saturday afternoon at 5 the Heat plays first-place Real Santa Barbara at 
Santa Barbara City College. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, San Diego plays host to the California Emperors Sunday in Chula 
Vista while Arizona, which is a single point back of Los Angeles, plays at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The regular season ends next weekend and yet the divisional race is a logjam 
thanks to the league's unusual scoring system that awards bonus points for the 
number of goals scored. Only 17 points separate all six teams and only four 
points separate four teams from third place and a final playoff spot. A victory 
in regulation time is worth six points. Each goal, up to a maximum of three a 
game, also adds a point. 
</P>
<P>
Several former South Bay stars could figure prominently in the weekend's 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
The Emperors, led by former Cal State Dominguez Hills goalie Chris Wilson and 
Mira Costa High's Kurt Allen, have won four consecutive games to vault from 
last place into second place, two points behind Real Santa Barbara. Paul Krumpe 
of Redondo Beach, who was voted to the All-APSL West team earlier in the week, 
is expected to start for Real Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has midfielder John Gerrard of Torrance and striker Steve Sharp, both 
cut earlier this season by the Heat. Sharp, however, who scored the winning 
goal for the Heat in a victory over San Diego in May, may not be available 
Sunday because of a scheduling conflict with his full-time job as a car 
salesman in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Gerrard, who has accumulated four yellow cards, faces a one-game suspension if 
he receives another. 
</P>
<P>
Heat defender Danny Pena has been voted to the All-APSL West first team for the 
second time in his career. He was also chosen in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat will be without defender Eric Biefeld Saturday. Biefeld is serving a 
one-game suspension for a red card received in a 2-1 victory over Arizona on 
Sunday. PAUL McLEOD

SUTHERLAND STILL CHASING COVERT IN BATTLE OF CONSECUTIVE RUNNING DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A challenge that began more than 20 years ago has turned into an integral part 
of life for Mark Covert of Lancaster and Jon Sutherland of West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Their goal in the late 1960s was to run every day for a year. More than two 
decades later, Covert and Sutherland have yet to miss a day. 
</P>
<P>
Having taken periodic breaks in his training during high school, Covert wanted 
to see if he could run every day for a year as a Valley College freshman. 
</P>
<P>
He reached his goal in July, 1969, which prompted Sutherland, who was working 
on a two-month streak of his own, to match his teammate's feat. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark was an inspiration to me," said Sutherland, who graduated from Granada 
Hills High. "When he had gone a year, I thought it was great." 
</P>
<P>
Covert, the NCAA Division II cross-country champion for Cal State Fullerton in 
1970, hit the 22-year mark July 23; Sutherland's streak turned 21 on May 26. 
</P>
<P>
According to their estimates, Covert has run more than 97,000 miles (an average 
of roughly 12 miles a day) during his streak and Sutherland has logged an 
astounding 125,000 miles (16 a day). 
</P>
<P>
The most miles Covert has run in a day during the streak is 52; the least is 
three. Sutherland has a high of 45 miles and a low of 2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Although no official records are kept, Ron Hill of England, the 1970 European 
and Commonwealth Games champion in the marathon, is generally acknowledged as 
having the world's longest running streak, spanning more than 25 years and 
120,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Covert and Sutherland, both 39, have run through a myriad of injuries (torn 
Achilles' tendons, cracked ribs, stress fractures) and illnesses (bronchitis, 
mononucleosis, flu) to keep their streaks intact, yet both deny feeling 
pressure to prolong them or outlast each other. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even think about it anymore," said Sutherland, a heavy-metal talent 
scout for Zomba Records in Hollywood and a syndicated rock columnist. "It's 
just something I do every day. It's just part of my life. When I get up in the 
morning, I always think, 'OK, what am I going to do today? Where am I going to 
run?' But I don't feel any pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Covert, the recently appointed cross-country and track and field coach (men's 
and women's) at Antelope Valley College, echoed Sutherland's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that big a deal when it first started," he said of his streak, which 
began when Lyndon Johnson was president and the American public was realizing 
that Vietnam was more than just a conflict. "But after it got to three or four 
years, it started ballooning. . . . At this point now, there's no reason not to 
run (every day). I mean, we've been doing it so long that it's going to take a 
pretty good reason, something other than an injury, to keep us from running." 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland, who held every Cal State Northridge track record from two miles to 
the marathon when he finished competing for CSUN in 1973, said he expects his 
streak to last until he is at least in his 60s, and he even joked that he 
eventually will pass Covert because he'll live longer. 
</P>
<P>
Covert, a Burbank High graduate, said it won't come to that. 
</P>
<P>
"One of these days, he's just going to bag it," Covert quipped. "He's just 
going to give up. . . . He'll never pass me because I'm a better man than Jon. 
It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
Kidding aside, Covert admits that his dedication to the streak might have been 
detrimental to his career as a national-class runner in the early to mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
"There were several times when I probably should have rested an injury but 
didn't," said Covert, who finished seventh in the marathon in the 1972 Olympic 
Trials. "I had some injuries that took three or four months to heal that would 
have only taken a week or two with rest. But I was still one of the top 10 or 
15 people in the country then and I couldn't justify (taking a day or two off). 
</P>
<P>
"I could now, but I'm no longer faced with that decision." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale-bound: Obed Aguirre, one of the state's top distance runners at San 
Fernando High during the 1989-90 school year, will compete for Glendale College 
in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, the San Fernando record-holder in the 1,600 (4 minutes 15.19 seconds) 
and 3,200 meters (9:01.11), chose Glendale over Pasadena City College. He did 
not meet NCAA Proposition 48 requirements and could not have run next season 
for a Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Mexico, Aguirre established himself as a junior at San Fernando -- 
placing fourth in the City Section cross-country championships and third in the 
3,200 meters in the City track finals -- and blossomed as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
In cross-country, he won the City title and placed seventh in the state 
Division I championships. On the track, he won the City title in the 3,200, and 
placed fourth in the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
The rich get richer: The Valley College women's track team doesn't need much 
help in the heptathlon -- not with defending state junior college champion 
Melanie Clarke returning next season -- but if Advantage Athletics Coach 
Charlie DiMarco is correct, the Lady Monarchs will be getting plenty when Notre 
Dame graduate Jennifer Stewart enrolls at the school next month. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who placed second in the high jump in this year's Southern Section 1-A 
Division championships, has never competed in a heptathlon, but with personal 
bests of 5 feet 8 inches in the high jump and 17-2 in the long jump, DiMarco 
figures the event eventually could be her best. 
</P>
<P>
Clinicians at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., agreed 
with him after putting Stewart through a series of tests during an elite junior 
training camp two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They said she has the strength and speed to be a heptathlete," DiMarco said. 
"Now it's just a matter of convincing her of that. I think she's just a little 
afraid of the 800." 
</P>
<P>
The 800 meters is the seventh -- and last -- event of the two-day heptathlon. 
</P>
<P>
The first day consists of the 100-meter low hurdles, high jump, shotput and 
200. The long jump and the javelin precede the 800 on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she could score close to 5,000 points in her very first (heptathlon)," 
DiMarco said of Stewart, who is the sister of Walt Stewart, the 1989 NCAA 
Division II high jump champion for Cal State Northridge. "Melanie and her 
should definitely go one-two in the state meet next season." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, a 1989 graduate of El Camino Real High, totaled 5,080 points to win the 
heptathlon in the The Athletics Congress Junior championships in June after 
scoring 5,034 to win the state junior college title in May. 
</P>
<P>
Record surprise: It didn't happen in the event in which they had expected, but 
the West Valley Eagles did set a national age-group record in the TAC Junior 
Olympics in Lincoln, Neb., last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Phillips, Jalal Milby, Michael Granville and Armone Lochard won the 
midget (10- and 11-year-old) boys' 1,600-meter relay in 3 minutes 51.08 
seconds, more than two seconds faster than the previous record set by the L. A. 
Jets in the TAC Youth Athletic championships in July. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets finished second Sunday, timing 3:51.23. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little disappointed that we didn't set a record in the 400 relay," 
West Valley Coach Roger Lipkis said. "But the 1,600 relay was a nice surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, Lochard, Steve Webber and Milby won the 400 relay, but their time of 
49.93 was short of the age-group record of 49.56. West Valley clocked a season 
best of 49.65 to win the TAC Youth meet. 
</P>
<P>
Granville's storming third leg (54.3) in the 1,600 relay made the record 
possible. He made up a large deficit on the L. A. Jets runner and gave the 
baton to Lochard in a virtual tie for first.

BEACH NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
SIX TOP PLAYERS WILL MISS LUCRATIVE SEAL BEACH EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When the men's pro beach volleyball tour rolls into Seal Beach this weekend for 
the 21st event of this year's circuit, the main question for a change won't be 
who is playing with whom. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it could be who isn't playing at Seal Beach at all. 
</P>
<P>
Despite one of the year's biggest purses -- $100,000 -- six of the tour's top 
pros will miss the event, which gets under way Saturday at 9 a.m.. The finals 
are scheduled for about 3 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
* Tim Hovland and Kent Steffes -- who have a first- and a second-place finish 
to show for their first two tournaments -- will be playing in Italy for an 
international event. 
</P>
<P>
* Karch Kiraly -- Brent Frohoff's regular partner -- is skipping Seal Beach to 
work the volleyball competition at the Goodwill Games in Seattle as a color 
analyst for the Turner Broadcasting Network. 
</P>
<P>
* Veteran teammates John Eddo and Sean Fallowfield are also playing in Italy 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
* And Scott Ayakatubby of Hermosa Beach didn't enter the tournament because of 
a sore back -- a recurring injury that has sidelined him several times in the 
past three years. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos are top-seeded at Seal Beach. Smith 
and Stoklos came from behind last weekend in Chicago -- from out of the losers' 
bracket -- to topple Hovland and Steffes in a sudden-death tiebreaker for the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
But the depleted field behind Smith and Stoklos means that some new names could 
find themselves advancing deep into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded team is Frohoff and Hovland's ex-partner, Mike Dodd. Frohoff 
is Dodd's fourth different teammate in as many weeks, following Hovland, Dan 
Vrebalovich and Ayakatubby. Next week Dodd might have to take on a fifth when 
Frohoff returns to action with Kiraly. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Jon Stevenson -- who won the Seal Beach event last year with 
Steffes -- is paired with Mike Whitmarsh this time around and is 10th-seeded. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Seal Beach wouldn't be an Assn. of Volleyball Professionals event if 
there wasn't at least one breakup beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Mear and Scott Friedrichsen, teammates for the past three years, called 
it quits this week, with Mear siding with Wally Goodrick and Friedrichsen 
shuffling off with Craig Moothart. 
</P>
<P>
On the Hovland-Dodd scale of volleyball breakups, this news rates about a "3" 
-- but it's not entirely insignificant because Mear and Friedrichsen have 
consistently been among the top eight seeded teams this season. 
</P>
<P>
The men seem to have taken the reins from the women in the soap opera on the 
beach as both seasons wind down. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, there wasn't a single major partner change on the draw sheet for 
this weekend's ladies' Pismo Beach Open -- a $25,000 event. 
</P>
<P>
That is good news for Manhattan Beach's Patty Dodd, who has had to shuffle 
partners this season almost as often as husband Mike. 
</P>
<P>
In last weekend's action in Tokyo, Dodd and new partner Rita Crockett-Royster 
placed a respectable third. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd and Crockett-Royster were knocked out in the losers' bracket final, 15-13, 
by red-hot Janice Opalinski and Lisa Strand. 
</P>
<P>
Opalinski and Strand had eliminated top-seeded Jackie Silva and Karolyn Kirby 
in the previous match, leaving Silva and Kirby with a season-low fifth-place 
finish. Opalinski-Strand then swept on to the title with a victory over Nina 
Matthies and Elaine Roque. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Frohoff's early round successes at the Op Pro surfing championships in 
Huntington Beach left South Bay surf watchers with a local boy to cheer on as 
this week progressed. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Robinson of Manhattan Beach advanced to the second round, but was 
out-surfed on Wednesday, 82.3-63.5, by Australian veteran Barton Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach's Scott Daley was ousted in the trial round.

There are fullbacks, and there are tailbacks, but last year in the Avocado 
League, Brian Madlangbayan was the other back. 
</P>
<P>
You know, the one who wasn't Terry Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughn, the Oceanside tailback, led the county in rushing with 1,496 yards (8.3 
yards per carry), scored 13 touchdowns and earned a scholarship to Arizona. He 
was the notable one . . . the league's offensive player of the year.

Madlangbayan, meanwhile, was the unheralded commodity on the other side of I-5, 
at El Camino High School. 
</P>
<P>
But at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Mira Mesa High School, Vaughn and Madlangbayan 
will be part of the same backfield as the best just-graduated seniors from San 
Diego County play those from the city of Los Angeles in the fourth Southern 
California College Prep All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is undefeated in the series. 
</P>
<P>
Though Vaughn got the attention last year, Madlangbayan ultimately got the 
grand prize. He led his team to a 13-1 record and the 2-A San Diego Section 
championship, rushing 144 times for 1,109 yards and 18 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those numbers, he was recruited by only four colleges -- Occidental, 
St. Mary's, Columbia and Hawaii -- and there wasn't a scholarship available 
from any of them. Hawaii, the only school of the four which even offers 
athletic scholarships, wanted him to walk on. Ivy League Columbia offered 
culture shock and the stigma of playing for the school that had the longest 
losing streak in NCAA history. St. Mary's felt uncomfortable. Madlangbayan 
chose Occidental, a Division III school that has won or tied for the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Conference title five of the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Coach Herb Meyer says recruiters overlooked Madlangbayan partly 
because of the team's slow start. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the season, we didn't score a lot; we had a brand new offensive line, 
and we were known as a predominantly defensive team," Meyer said. "At the same 
time, (Vaughn) had two or three big games for Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we started putting everything together. Everybody thought we were winning 
because we had a great defensive team, but we broke most of our offensive 
records, and Brian had a great year." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino had the county's third-ranked defense and ninth-ranked offense. 
Madlangbayan averaged 110.9 yards per game, 7.7 per carry and was the county's 
fourth-leading scorer. But he didn't even have the best statistics in his 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
Madlangbayan said he will be playing with a purpose on Saturday. "I'm just 
trying to show those guys they made a mistake in not picking me up." 
</P>
<P>
One reason it might have been easy to overlook the kid with the funny last name 
was that Madlangbayan stood only 5-feet-5 1/2 and weighed 168 pounds, though 
football programs listed him as 5-7, 175. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said Madlangbayan's size -- and low center of gravity -- made him 
difficult to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"He bounces off a lot of tackles," Meyer said. "If he doesn't really get 
wrapped up, he spins out of pileups and bounces off a lot of tacklers. Plus, 
he's got tremendous leg strength, and he keeps his legs moving, he's well 
built, and he's got very good balance." 
</P>
<P>
Madlangbayan: "I try not to bowl anybody over, I just try to go with the impact 
(of the collision). People tell me that I look like a pinball machine because 
I'm bouncing off everything." 
</P>
<P>
He says his size works both ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I can get through the line easier because the linemen can't see me, but if 
they get ahold of me, they can throw me around a little bit," he said. "The key 
is to make sure they don't get ahold of me." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's offensive coach is Ramona's Mel Galli, who plenty of Madlangbayan. 
The Wildcats beat Galli's Bulldogs, 27-0 during the regular season and 49-0 in 
the section semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think his heart and his attitude mean more than his size in his particular 
position," Galli said. "In the last week and a half of being with him at 
practices, he's been a very positive, can-do type of guy. He really believes in 
himself and that he can get the job done, and he's not arrogant about it by any 
means. In fact, he's probably one of the friendliest guys on the team, but he 
doesn't take a back seat to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Galli added that it was because of Madlangbayan's timing -- in addition to his 
sheer talent -- that he was invited to join the team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the number of touchdowns that he scored, but it was the critical 
plays that he made against us," Galli said. "They would give him the ball on 
fourth down, and he would go 30 or 40 yards." 
</P>
<P>
Madlangbayan will get a chance to work for Galli instead of against him, and 
he's looking forward to competing against Los Angeles and sticking up for San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're highly underrated in San Diego," Madlangbayan said. "I'm not 
taking anything away from L.A, but I don't think San Diego gets as much credit 
as it deserves. In the Shrine Game, we had only two players representing San 
Diego. . . . As a team, we're just trying to show that we're as good or better 
than the talent in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
So the player who was overlooked -- playing for the city that is overlooked -- 
has something to prove. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect him to be just another back on Saturday.

TV SHOW GOES BACK TO ROCK'S FIRST WAVE

<P>
In the late 1950s and early '60s, rock 'n' roll was really "happening," 
30-year-old Carlsbad resident Domenic Priore said just the other day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was simple, innocent, upbeat and made for dancing. "And you can't really do 
any better than that." 
</P>
<P>
Priore's trying to bring some of the joyful sounds (and sights) of first-wave 
rockers back in the spotlight. He's producing a weekly television dance show 
modeled after such long-ago teen tube favorites as "Shindig" and "Hullabaloo." 
</P>
<P>
The half-hour program with the '60s-style title "It's Happening" has aired on 
public-access cable TV stations in Los Angeles since last September and Austin, 
Tex. since April. "It's Happening" makes its San Diego debut tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The show consists of Priore and his co-host, Audrey Moorehead, spinning classic 
rockabilly, Mod, surf-rock, soul, girl-group, and British Invasion discs; 
screenings of vintage music film clips like the Castaways doing "Liar Liar" and 
the Spencer Davis Group doing "I'm a Man," and live performances by a handful 
of house bands, including the Event and the Nashville Ramblers from San Diego, 
and Fresno's Quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the program, the makeshift dance floor inside the studios of Daniels 
Cablevision in Carlsbad, where the show is filmed, is abuzz with upward of 30 
twisting and shouting teens dressed in period apparel: girls in go-go boots and 
mini-skirts, guys in tab-collar shirts and pegged pants. 
</P>
<P>
Shows of this sort were generated after the Beatles' first appearance on the 
"Ed Sullivan Show" in 1964. That show "grabbed such a huge share of the 
television audience that every network, and many independent stations in cities 
all over America, launched their own shows devoted entirely to teen-age rock 
'n' roll music," Priore said. 
</P>
<P>
"By the late 1960s, however, everyone was getting into drugs and Vietnam, and 
that took away the original spirit of rock 'n' roll. The shows were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since, I've really missed them, and now I'm finally in a position to do 
something about it," Priore said. "'It's Happening' isn't just influenced by 
all those old shows, it's a direct take-off. 
</P>
<P>
"We play only music from that time period, either on record, on film, or live, 
performed by bands -- doing covers as well as their own '60s-style originals -- 
that use all the original equipment and amps to get the right sound." 
</P>
<P>
Priore was born in Pasadena and raised in nearby Monterey Park. As a child, he 
grew up listening to AM radio and watching teen dance shows on TV -- and what 
he heard, and saw, made quite a formidable impression. 
</P>
<P>
"Having heard the great sounds of original rock 'n' roll, the music that came 
out after about 1966 could never satisfy me," Priore said. "Rock was starting 
to mellow out and take on this pretentious idea of being serious; it was no 
longer simple, no longer upbeat, no longer fun. Rock 'n' roll had lost its 
original good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
While studying broadcast journalism at Pasadena City College in 1985, Priore 
began to hang out at the Cavern Club in Los Angeles, an underground dance club 
that would have fit right in to the pop scene in Liverpool, circa 1962. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing there were young people into Mod and rockabilly and all these other 
sub-genres of the big rock picture excited me to the point where I felt I could 
find the right kind of audience, the right kind of music, and the right kind of 
bands to put together a TV dance show of my own," Priore said. 
</P>
<P>
He promptly recruited Cavern Club deejay Audrey Moorehead to join him, and, by 
the end of the year, the two produced several prototypes in the college 
broadcast studio. 
</P>
<P>
They continued to "film, improve, and stockpile," Priore said, for the ensuing 
four years, until they finally felt they had a professional product worthy of 
public broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Priore wrote a book, "Look! Listen! Vibrate! SMILE!", about 
the Beach Boys' landmark 1966 "Smile" sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Happening" made its official TV debut in September, 1989, on five 
different Los Angeles cable public-access channels. The program was picked up 
by Austin's citywide cable company the following April, and, beginning tonight, 
will be seen in San Diego as well. 
</P>
<P>
Three local cable companies will air the program Friday nights, on their 
respective public-access stations: Cox Cable (Channel 24, 1 a.m.), Daniels 
Cablevision/Carlsbad (Channel 3, 7 p.m.), and North County's Dimension Cable 
(Channel 8, 8 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
The show will also be carried by Southwestern Cable (Channel 16, 6 p.m. 
Saturdays) and Daniels Cablevision/Del Mar (Channel 38, 5:30 p.m. Tuesdays). 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, to celebrate the local premiere of "It's Happening," the Belly 
Up Tavern in Solana Beach night will be hosting a concert featuring two of the 
program's regulars, the Event and Quagmire. Between sets, Priore and Moorehead 
will screen music film clips of bands like the Kinks, the Yardbirds, and the 
Rolling Stones. Eventually, Priore said, he'd like to see the program on 
commercial TV. But, before he begins pitching "It's Happening" to production 
companies in the hopes of landing a distribution deal, he said, he wants to get 
the show on as many public-access stations around the country as he can. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still sticking with my original plan, which is to air it everywhere and 
make it popular so that when I do pitch it to production companies, they won't 
try to ruin it, they'll keep it just the way it is, because it will already 
have proven itself," Priore said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's really important to me: I don't want anyone to modernize it or change 
it in any way. I wouldn't want it to lose its impact, and besides, there's 
already much too much of that computerized-beat dance stuff out there, as it 
is."

COUNTRY SINGER TO RELEASE FIRST SINGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Country singer Dale Watson, a regular attraction at Tuesday night Barn Dance 
concerts at the Palomino in North Hollywood, will be honored at next week's 
show to celebrate the release of his first nationwide single. 
</P>
<P>
Next Friday Curb Records will release Watson's recording, "One Tear at a Time," 
a sad, reflective tune written immediately after he and his wife broke up last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's how you should just try to get over things one step at a time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Watson is applying the same principle to his career. If the song does well on 
the charts -- Watson believes it must get in the Top 50 within two months -- 
Curb will very likely go ahead with plans to release an entire album in the 
fall. If not, his contract with the company could be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'm trying not to get too excited over the release," said Watson, 
who plans to tour New Mexico, Colorado and Arizona at the end of August. He 
said the song is being shipped to country Western radio stations throughout the 
country. MICHAEL ARKUSH

CLUB M: A MENU-VENUE MIX; 
</P>
<P>
ITALIAN RESTAURANT SERVES UP BANDS AT NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Each evening, shortly after 9, beer replaces red wine, and the lasagna may be 
done for the night. The dinner crowd gives way to the dance crowd. Canoga 
Park's Mancini's Restaurant, an Italian eatery, becomes Club M, the West 
Valley's new home of live music for almost any appetite. 
</P>
<P>
Sample the menu: Sundays -- ballroom dancing, big band music. Mondays -- Dead 
Head Night. Tuesdays -- jam sessions. Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays -- rock 
'n' roll. Thursdays -- Top 40. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition with Italian restaurants is so thick," said Dennis Mancini, 
"that I had to find another way to entice people." He has owned the restaurant 
since 1970 and got his liquor license in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini opened the club in January, bringing in Matthew Smyrnos -- who has 
contacts with L.A. bands -- to book entertainment. The first month was "a 
disaster," Smyrnos recalled. "We'd get five or 10 people a night. I hated it." 
</P>
<P>
The club raised the cover price to $7, then lowered it to $5, and briefly 
contemplated no admission charge at all. (The current cover is $3 during the 
week, $5 on weekends.) 
</P>
<P>
Finally, business picked up. Smyrnos attributed the turnaround to the 
introduction of new sound and lighting equipment and other renovations; 
altogether, Mancini spent $230,000 to remodel the restaurant. Soon bands that 
were reluctant to play at a restaurant far from the Hollywood strip, or even 
the East Valley, began signing up for frequent gigs. They earn a fixed 
percentage of the gate. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played at FM Station and the Palomino, and the equipment at Club M is 
the best we've come across," said Greg Herman, guitarist for the Valley-based 
psychedelic group Pur'p'l Tur't'lz. "Plus, it doesn't have the L.A. club 
atmosphere, where everyone is up-tight, and it makes us play a lot more 
relaxed. There's no attitude there." 
</P>
<P>
Which is exactly the way Mancini and Smyrnos envisioned the club -- an escape 
from the strip scene, yet still a venue for the best possible rock 'n' roll 
talent. The square dance floor is surrounded by several dozen tables, and there 
are plenty of good views of the stage. Among other local bands that have 
performed there: Tuff, Captain Cardiac &amp; the Coronaries, and the Dead 
Center. "There are none of the hassles, like parking, that you get in 
Hollywood," Smyrnos said. "Down there, you'll spend $10 to $20 a night, and 
have to deal with the whole scene." 
</P>
<P>
Still, is the club too secluded from Hollywood and the East Valley to draw 
enough customers, and will the record industry show up to check out new acts? 
</P>
<P>
"We're surrounded by people in this area," Smyrnos responded. "That's not even 
counting Simi Valley, which is 10 minutes away, and that place is dead. Kids 
from there come here." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he said, the club has held several showcase events attended by 
industry representatives. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, another Canoga Park club, Michael Fell's Industry, tried to make it in 
the West Valley but closed about six months later. Smyrnos sees no parallel. 
"They were expensive, and we've been able to establish a nightclub without 
losing the aspect of being a restaurant. We still have that base." 
</P>
<P>
Smyrnos sees the club's versatility as its chief asset. On Wednesdays, it holds 
a "No Top 40 Junk" night for people tired of the familiar radio music. "We're 
not restricted to a specific format," he said. "Take a place like the Country 
Club, which has to rely on speed metal shows." 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Club M started a new Sunday night series of ballroom dancing. 
Couples, mostly in their 50s and 60s, danced to the sounds of Patsy Cline's 
"Crazy" and Frank Sinatra's "Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do that disco stuff," said Barbara Rose of Encino. "We like to do the 
swing and the cha-cha. And there just aren't that many places in the Valley 
where older people can go dancing. Most of the places have small dance floors." 
</P>
<P>
Two nights later, the Geniuses, a blues/jazz band, jammed before about 50 
people -- 200 is the club's capacity. The crowd was much younger. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the people we're going after the most," Smyrnos said. "They want the 
rock 'n' roll."

AFTER 30 YEARS, SUN SETS ON 'SUN-UP SAN DIEGO'

<P>
KFMB-TV(Channel 8) is canceling "Sun-Up San Diego," a mainstay of local morning 
television for almost 30 years, the station announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The last show will air Aug. 10, just a few days short of the show's 30th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 8 also announced it will produce a new afternoon talk show, hosted by 
"P.M. Magazine" co-hosts Pat Brown and Dave Hood, scheduled to debut in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Sun-Up producer Pat Elwood will work on the new show, but hosts Kathi Diamant 
and Jerry G. Bishop have been given notice. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Up aired live at 8 a.m. until earlier this year, when the station switched 
it to 9 a.m., in order to align itself with network programming and to allow 
for an early-morning local newscast. 
</P>
<P>
The show "did poorly against well-established talk shows" in the 9 a.m. time 
slot, according to Channel 8 vice president Bill Moylan. None of the Sun-Up 
staff was available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"These things happen in this business," Moylan said. "Nothing is forever."

<P>
A confidentiality agreement prevented ANR from disclosing the seller of the 
interests or the amount paid, said Jim Bailey, spokesman for Coastal Corp., 
ANR's parent firm. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction will increase ANR Production's average working interest in the

MIDDLE EAST: BAKER AND SHEVARDNADZE CALL FOR A WORLDWIDE EMBARGO ON ARMS SALES 
TO BAGHDAD.

In an unprecedented show of superpower cooperation, the Soviet Union and the 
United States today demanded that all countries cut off arms supplies to Iraq 
because of its invasion of Kuwait, and the Soviet foreign minister predicted 
that Iraq would soon withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, and Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
read a joint statement demanding the arms cutoff to reporters after a hastily 
scheduled, one-hour meeting at a Moscow airport. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Soviet statement noted that the Soviet Union had cut off arms supplies 
to Iraq on Thursday and that the United States had frozen Iraqi assets. The two 
superpowers also demanded in the statement that Iraq withdraw its troops from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze also told reporters, "We have been assured that very soon the 
Iraqis will pull out their troops." He said the Soviets, until this week Iraq's 
largest arms supplier, learned this through contacts in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
After Iraq overran Kuwait on Thursday, ostensibly because of a dispute over oil 
and a border region, it said its forces could withdraw within a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said the Soviet leadership had sent a message to Iraqi leader 
Saddam Hussein on Thursday, but he did not reveal the contents. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Soviet statement demanded that other countries stop sending arms to 
Iraq, but it did not mention by name the Middle East nation's other major 
weapons suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze opened the news conference by saying the Kremlin's decision to cut 
off its arms supplies to Iraq was difficult. "It wasn't so easy for us to make 
the kind of statement we made yesterday" because Soviet relations with Iraq had 
been good for decades, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said the invasion "contradicts the principles of new political 
thinking and the principles of civilized relations between nations." 
</P>
<P>
A report on Soviet TV news said, "The statement contains an appeal to the 
international public to come out together in condemnation of the act of 
aggression." Washington and Moscow have condemned the invasion on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's plane arrived in Moscow from Mongolia today more than an hour late 
because a tire blew when it landed for refueling in the Siberian city of 
Irkutsk. Baker cut short his state visit to Mongolia for the Moscow talks and 
to return to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, Baker told reporters: "I 
just hope that the United States and Soviet Union could join in a joint 
statement regarding this matter. The fact, I think, of our doing that would be 
quite unique and rather significant."

An Iraqi government spokesman said today that Iraqi troops will begin 
withdrawing from Kuwait this Sunday, Baghdad Radio announced. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said all the Iraqi troops that are in Kuwait will be withdrawn 
according to a timetable, the radio broadcast said. 
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made on condition that there be no threats to Kuwaiti and Iraqi 
security. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast, which was also carried by a station calling itself the 
Provisional Government of Kuwait Radio, said the Al-Sabah royal family that 
ruled Kuwait for almost 250 years will never return to power. 
</P>
<P>
"The bygone regime is finished forever and will never come back," the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi invasion forces in Kuwait were still massing near the border with Saudi 
Arabia today, and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein agreed to meet the Kuwaiti 
emir and other Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Shelling and gunfire today shook portions of Kuwait's capital, indicating a 
last-ditch attempt by Kuwaiti forces to hold out against the more powerful 
Iraqi army. 
</P>
<P>
Before the pullout announcement, President Bush said Iraq's occupation of 
Kuwait was a matter of grave concern and that expansion by Iraqi troops into 
Saudi Arabia or other Gulf oil states would be "unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
A NATO source said the United States has alerted allies that it has 
"contingency plans" if the Iraqis do push beyond Kuwaiti territory. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department said Iraqi troops were within 5 to 10 miles 
of the Saudi border. "Their presence there clearly raises significant concern," 
spokesman Richard Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
The department also said 14 Americans are now known to be missing in Kuwait and 
Washington believes that they are in Iraqi hands. 
</P>
<P>
A Saudi Arabian official told Reuters news agency that Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak, Saudi King Fahd and Jordan's King Hussein will attend the Sunday 
meeting with Saddam Hussein and the Kuwaiti emir. The five are expected to meet 
in the Saudi Red Sea port of Jiddah. 
</P>
<P>
The emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, took refuge in Saudi Arabia 
on Thursday, when Iraqi troops backed by 350 tanks and air cover swept into 
Kuwait before dawn and penetrated as far as Kuwait's southern oil fields near 
the border with Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest producer of oil. 
</P>
<P>
A well-informed diplomatic source said there had been no movement of Iraqi 
troops across the Saudi frontier today. But some members of Congress expressed 
fears that Saudi Arabia could be Hussein's next target. 
</P>
<P>
The NATO source, speaking in Brussels on condition of anonymity, said the 
United States informed allies during a special meeting "that it was aware that 
Iraq may have designs beyond Kuwait and informed the allies that it has drawn 
up contingency plans of action to respond to that eventuality." He said 
American officials did not explain what actions were under consideration.

Stocks closed sharply lower today although they managed to rebound as bargain 
hunters were encouraged by signs the Middle East conflict may be easing. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, after being down 120 points at its 
midsession low, closed with a 54.95-point loss at 2,809.65. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by a one-sided margin on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume reached a 1990 high of 292.36 million shares, against 253.09 
million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 3.53 to 188.83. 
</P>
<P>
The market snapped back from depressed levels on a statement by Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that Iraq had assured Moscow it would withdraw 
from Kuwait soon. 
</P>
<P>
However, the mood on Wall Street remained bearish, with traders viewing the 
price explosion on world oil markets and a government report showing 
unemployment at the highest level in two years as threatening serious 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported this morning that nonfarm payroll employment fell 
by 219,000 in July, surprising analysts who had been looking for a modest 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
The civilian unemployment rate jumped 3/10ths of a percentage point, to 5.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Those figures reinforced concern in the financial world that economic activity 
was weakening more than had been thought just a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers fear the economy's problems could be compounded by a jump in oil 
prices arising from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait this week. 
</P>
<P>
Selling intensified as reports reached Wall Street that Iraqi forces were near 
the border of Saudi Arabia. It subsequently let up a bit when a Soviet official 
said Iraq was expected to withdraw from Kuwait in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Short-term interest rates tumbled and some bond prices bobbed up this morning 
as traders temporarily ignored the inflationary implications of a possibly 
prolonged oil price spiral. 
</P>
<P>
Rates on short-term government bills registered the most reaction to a Labor 
Department report showing the nation's unemployment rate shot up to 5.5% in 
July from 5.2% in June. 
</P>
<P>
The widely awaited report was viewed as an indication that the struggling 
economy may be slipping into recession. Last month's jobless rate was the 
highest since it hit 5.6% in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase largely reflected the economy's loss of 219,000 jobs. Though 
about 160,000 of those Americans who lost jobs were temporary census workers 
laid off by the government, private industry payrolls also lost 45,000 jobs, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Bond market analysts regarded the interest rate improvements today as 
unsustainable. 
</P>
<P>
Carl F. Napolitano of R. C. Government Securities Inc. said the spike in oil 
prices sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has reduced the chances that the 
Federal Reserve soon will relax its monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
He said the unfolding crisis in the Middle East, widely expected to drive oil 
prices higher around the world and fuel inflation, will outweigh concerns about 
the faltering economy and make the Fed reluctant to ease. 
</P>
<P>
The danger would be that the central bank might fan inflation by engineering 
lower interest rates. Fighting inflation is the Fed's chief mission. 
</P>
<P>
Intermediate and long-term government bond prices continued to slump this 
morning, reflecting pessimism about the possibility of a shift to a more 
generous credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond skidded nearly 1/2 point, or $5 per 
$1,000 in face value, on top of Thursday's loss of 1 7/32 points. Its yield, 
which rises when the bond's price falls, rose to 8.50% from 8.45% late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But prices of short-term governments added 7/32 point to 1/8 point while 
intermediate maturities ranged from up 9/32 point to down 9/32 point. Long-term 
issues were 13/32 point to 1/2 point higher, according to Telerate Inc., a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, regained 0.36 to 1,167.73 by late morning. It lost 4.99 points in 
Thursday's selloff. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills dropped to 7.52% as the discount plunged 
13 basis points to 7.29%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.52% as the 
discount receded 14 basis points to 7.16%. Yields on one-year bills pulled back 
to 7.53% as the discount decreased 16 basis points to 7.04%.

E. GERMAN CHIEF URGES EARLIER JOINT ELECTIONS;

EUROPE: PRIME MINISTER WOULD ADVANCE DATE NEARLY TWO MONTHS TO FORESTALL 
ECONOMIC COLLAPSE IN EAST.

<P>
East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere called today for unification with 
West Germany and joint elections in October, advancing the date by nearly two 
months to forestall economic collapse in the East. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere told a news conference that his proposal for elections Oct. 14 
instead of Dec. 2 was coordinated with West German Chancellor and fellow 
Christian Democrat Helmut Kohl at a meeting in Austria on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, Kohl welcomed the proposal and said the two states should discuss soon 
how it could be organized in time. 
</P>
<P>
"It corresponds to the wishes of people in both parts of Germany," Kohl said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
But De Maiziere's left-wing coalition allies, the Social Democrats, complained 
that they had not been consulted, and the Soviet Union warned that the plan 
would preempt a European settlement of unification's strategic aspects. 
</P>
<P>
"For the historically important first all-German elections I propose the date 
of Oct. 14, the same day that regional elections (to restore five federal 
states in eastern Germany) are planned," De Maiziere said. 
</P>
<P>
An October merger would occur just a year after East German Communist Party 
leader Erich Honecker resigned in the face of a pro-democracy uprising, ending 
40 years of Stalinist autocracy. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere said the resolution of foreign -- mainly Soviet -- objections to 
unification last month and East Germany's worsening economic crisis have 
telescoped the merger process. 
</P>
<P>
"The pan-German election creates political clarity and thus economic security," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The faster that happens, the better for the restructuring of existing 
companies, for new investment and therefore for the creation of new jobs," De 
Maiziere said. "The last few days have shown this ever more clearly."

STARK SAYS HE REGRETS CALLING SULLIVAN 'A DISGRACE TO HIS RACE'

The chairman of a House health subcommittee said today that he should not have 
called Louis W. Sullivan "a disgrace to his race" when he criticized the Health 
and Human Services secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"To the secretary, I have to say I blew it," Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland) told 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
But he reiterated criticism of Sullivan, who is black, for supporting 
Administration policies that are "bankrupt" and damaging to minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan had demanded an apology, responding to the original criticism with: "I 
don't live on Pete Stark's plantation." 
</P>
<P>
Stark, who is white, said his reference to race had obscured his central 
complaint about Sullivan's positions on abortion, health care and civil rights. 
Stark is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's subcommittee on 
health. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans had strongly criticized Stark for his statement Thursday, and the 
White House castigated what it called Stark's "bigoted assault." 
</P>
<P>
Before Stark spoke, House Minority Leader Bob Michel (R-Ill.) led a series of 
Republican critics on the House floor, charging that Stark had brought 
"discredit on this institution" and demanding an apology. He called Stark's 
attack "as bizarre as it is deplorable."

It's not the heat but a faulty bearing that stopped the clock in the Big Ben 
bell tower three times this week, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The hands of the famous clock on the tower of the Houses of Parliament stopped 
at 5:11 a.m. today, which is about where they snagged Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe, as a result of investigations carried out this morning, that the 
problem is to do with a bearing in the eastern face of the clock, and that once 
that bearing has been replaced or lubricated, that the problem will go away," 
said Toby Sargent, spokesman for the Department of Environment. 
</P>
<P>
Sargent said it apparently was just a coincidence that the clock broke down 
during the hottest days of the London summer. On Thursday, the temperature 
reached 97 degrees.

A new satellite monitoring system appears to be succeeding in monitoring 
illegal fishing and assisted in the apprehension of Japanese fishing illegally 
in the north Pacific Ocean, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard on Wednesday found 12.5 tons of apparently illegal salmon 
in the freezer holds of the Daian Maru No. 65, one of six Japanese fishing 
boats located 30 miles outside the squid fishing boundary by a satellite, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The vessels were detained by the Coast Guard and transferred to the custody of 
a Japanese patrol vessel, accused of violating provisions of the International 
North Pacific Fisheries Convention, the U.S./Japanese Driftnet Agreement and 
Japanese domestic squid fishing regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The new satellite system has been in use since May following agreements 
requiring satellite transmitters aboard certain fishing vessels.

UNEMPLOYED RATE HITS 5.5% IN JULY, HIGHEST IN 2 YEARS

<P>
The nation's unemployment rate jumped to 5.5% in July -- the highest jobless 
rate in two years, the government said today in a report providing mounting 
evidence of a weak economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said July's 0.3 percentage point rise, up from the June 
jobless rate of 5.2%, put the American unemployment rate at its highest level 
since it hit 5.6% in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in unemployment was due largely to the economy's loss of 
219,000 jobs, the government said. Though about 160,000 of those Americans who 
lost jobs were temporary census workers laid off by the government, private 
industry payrolls also lost 45,000 jobs.

The report shows that the "economy appears to be caving in to a full-fledged 
recession," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts said the unemployment data showed an economy skirting the edge 
of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy is just hung up on a rock on the middle of the road. It's still an 
economy that's inching ahead, but at a glacial pace. . . . We're close to the 
edge. It wouldn't take much of a breeze to push us over," said Robert Dederick, 
chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, noted that weak 
job growth had spread to the nation's service sector. 
</P>
<P>
That sector had been "the major engine of job growth during the current 
economic expansion. But that engine seems to have sputtered in July," Norwood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Job losses in the private sector were largely due to the continuing 
deterioration in the nation's construction and manufacturing sectors, the 
government said. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts were bracing for even worse unemployment news in the months ahead 
as the impact of a prolonged period of economic sluggishness begins to force 
the jobless rate higher. 
</P>
<P>
Construction payrolls fell by 50,000 jobs, after seasonal adjustment, posting 
the fifth consecutive decline to reflect continued weakness in the housing 
market, the government said. The number of jobs in the construction industry is 
more than 100,000 below the level of last fall, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's manufacturing slump continued in July, but factory job losses were 
not as great as they have been in the past. Last month, factory payrolls fell 
by 7,000 jobs, marking the 15th time in 16 months that manufacturing jobs 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
Since reaching a post-recession peak in March, 1989, nearly 350,000 factory 
jobs have been lost.

Florida agricultural officials today declared an end to a 3 1/2-month Medfly 
infestation -- with a slap at Southern California for taking so long to get rid 
of its pests. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters sprayed up to 20 square miles of suburban Miami with malathion in 
eight aerial treatments to kill Mediterranean fruit flies, considered the most 
destructive farm pest because it can attack 250 different fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike in Southern California, the spraying went on with little fuss. 
</P>
<P>
California's year-old infestation has spread to more than 900 square miles with 
limited aerial pesticide spraying and has cost more than $38 million to fight 
so far, said Florida Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner. 
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely vital to move quickly and aggressively, which is exactly what 
we did," he said.

A plunge in stock-index futures prices this morning on the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange triggered a two-minute trading halt that is one of the "circuit 
breakers" intended to prevent a runaway stock-market collapse. 
</P>
<P>
All Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures contracts fell the permitted 
opening limit of 5 points in the first 10 minutes, forcing exchange officials 
to declare a trading halt from 9:40 a.m. to 9:42 a.m., according to an exchange 
spokesman. He said prices continued to fall when trading resumed. The 
near-month contract, for September delivery, came within 1/10th point of a 
12-point loss, which is the next circuit-breaker limit, before prices rallied.

PRICE OF CRUDE OIL SURGES AMID FEARS; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: WORLD MARKETS REACT TO THE IRAQI THREAT. TRADERS FEAR SAUDI ARABIA MAY 
BE ATTACKED NEXT.

<P>
Crude oil prices surged on world markets today as fears mounted that Iraq would 
move against Saudi Arabia after establishing control over Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures soared from the opening, 
with the September contract gaining a record $2.34 to $25.45 in the first two 
hours of trading. 
</P>
<P>
The trading range, reflecting concerns that no one could tell where Iraq's 
military machine would stop, fulfills Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's stated 
wish for a barrel of oil at $25. 
</P>
<P>
"Crude oil prices climbed steadily from the opening and scored gains almost by 
the minute," said trader Peter Beutel, with Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. "And the 
market is still moving up, fast." 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices gained $1.75 in the first hour of trading, steadily pushing up 
refined products prices that soared in sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
At noon, unleaded gasoline was quoted up 7.93 to 76.00 cents a gallon. Heating 
oil was quoted up 6.21 cents to 70.90. 
</P>
<P>
"The crude market rallied strongly on early fears that Iraq was massing troops 
at the Saudi border," said Steve Platt, senior energy analyst with Dean Witter 
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. "Reports that the troops had crossed into Saudi 
Arabia appeared not immediately correct but prices are moving up to include 
this eventuality." 
</P>
<P>
Traders and analysts said the market could see some corrections but prices were 
likely to hold at a high level until the crisis in the Middle East is resolved. 
They agreed that the most important factor likely to influence the market would 
be the U.S. response to Iraq's aggressive policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The crude oil price at $25 a barrel seems overdone at this stage, and the 
barrel could shed $2, but it is likely to hold at the $23 level," Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded 
international crude, was quoted at $23.25 a barrel today, up 86 cents from 
Thursday, when the price rose $2 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices also tumbled overseas in response to the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 729.42 points, 
ending the day at 29,515.76. The index lost nearly 593 points on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is especially vulnerable to the possibility of a disruption of energy 
sources because it imports 99% of its oil. Traders there are concerned that the 
oil price rise will take a heavy toll on Japanese business.

LIZ SMITH: THE HOOK IN THE LATEST ELVIS TELL-ALL BOOK: SEX FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
POOR ELVIS Presley. Only the reputation of Marilyn Monroe has been so sullied 
and bandied about. And Marilyn's been dead 28 years compared with Elvis' 13, so 
there is plenty of time to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
The latest invasion comes in the September issue of Penthouse in an interview 
with Earl Greenwood, Elvis' second cousin. Greenwood claims Elvis told him he 
(Greenwood) was the only person he could trust. Does this sound familiar? 
Anyway, Greenwood has written a book (surprise!). Titled "The Boy Who Would Be 
King," coming from Dutton, it purports to tell the whole truth about Elvis, and 
actually, it does seem to present Presley in a more sympathetic light than some 
recent works have. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood tells Penthouse: "Let's face facts. Elvis did have a drug problem, 
and, yes, Elvis did mistreat women. I'm not going to sugarcoat the truth. Elvis 
was a poor boy who suddenly found himself sitting on top of the world. There 
were drugs and booze and women. But Elvis wasn't depraved, nor was he a 
self-indulgent egomaniac. . . . Elvis was a victim of his upbringing. He was a 
poor sharecropper's son who literally became a god to millions of people. He 
was never prepared for all of this." 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood's most startling comments in Penthouse have to do with Col. Tom 
Parker, Elvis' manager. Greenwood claims that Parker literally blackmailed 
Presley into giving him 50% of everything the singer pulled in. How? "Let's put 
it this way. We've all heard of the trouble Rob Lowe got into making those sex 
videos. Well, Elvis beat Rob Lowe to the punch." 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood says that back in 1960, he and Elvis and several young women 
participated in a five-night sexual debauch that was filmed. Parker got the 
film and used it as a financial lever. Greenwood says the film still exists and 
that Parker probably still has it. 
</P>
<P>
The truth? We won't know that until the raunchy home movie appears somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But when one considers the way Col. Parker mismanaged Elvis's career and the 
meek way that Presley acquiesced to whatever lamebrained movie Parker chose for 
him, it makes some sense.

Makers of infomercials, the program-length commercials of off-hour TV, 
announced the creation of their industry's first trade association Thursday, 
hoping to reduce regulators' scrutiny and ease consumers' fears. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us legitimacy in the eyes of Capitol Hill and consumers, and it 
establishes us as a long-term industry," said Greg Renker, whose Palm 
Desert-based Guthy-Renker Corp. markets self-help and motivational courses. 
</P>
<P>
The "infomerchants" will be known as the National Infomercial Marketing Assn. 
and will work with Congress and the Federal Trade Commission to develop 
advertising standards for the industry, Renker said. 
</P>
<P>
The industry, born in the mid-'80s, has attracted widespread publicity and 
thousands of consumer complaints about false and deceptive advertising, 
especially concerning infomercials that pose as talk shows and news specials.

Cable News Network, which began experimenting with a viewer choice segment on 
its "Newsnight" program just last week, said today it will cancel the segment 
when necessary because of breaking news. 
</P>
<P>
The interactive news format, which allows viewers to choose two secondary or 
feature stories using a special 900 telephone line, was suspended for the first 
time Thursday night because of the breaking story on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The interactive segment is still very much alive. However, we will cancel it 
on nights where there is a big breaking story," said CNN spokesman Steve 
Haworth. 
</P>
<P>
CNN said it received some calls from viewers Wednesday night complaining that 
the network didn't show enough on the Iraqi invasion while it did use the 
viewer choice segment on "Newsnight," which airs for an hour beginning at 9 
p.m. PDT.

MGM/UA CLAIMS PAY PACT WITH BUSFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MGM/UA Television announced today that its dispute over salary with 
"thirtysomething" actor Timothy Busfield has been "satisfactorily resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Busfield, who received his third consecutive Emmy nomination for his role of 
offbeat adman Elliot Weston, was expected to join the cast late today or 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Production on the acclaimed ABC series began today for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
Busfield's publicist said he completed his starring role in the Broadway 
production of "A Few Good Men" Thursday and was returning to Los Angeles today. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement came after a flurry of recriminations and angry debate over 
Busfield's demand for a salary hike. MGM/UA took the unusual action of publicly 
releasing the actor's salary, $28,750 an episode, and his money request, 
$36,375 an episode. Then MGM/UA filed a lawsuit last week in Los Angeles 
Superior Court seeking damages. 
</P>
<P>
It's not known if Busfield is getting his raise. His attorney, Edward J. Burg, 
was not available to comment. A spokesperson for MGM/UA said she was advised 
that no further comment could be made outside the carefully worded press 
release. 
</P>
<P>
Busfield was reportedly unhappy that he was getting $10,000 less each epidosde 
than Ken Olin, who plays Elliot's buddy and boss on the show.

PGA BARS CLUBS WITH DUBIOUS RACIAL POLICIES;

GOLF: IN THE WAKE OF SHOAL CREEK, THE TOUR SAYS IT WILL NOT ALLOW EVENTS WHERE 
THERE IS ANY QUESTION OF BIAS.

<P>
The PGA Tour, reacting to threats of protest and sponsor pullouts at the PGA 
Championship, said today that it will not allow tournaments at clubs where 
membership even "raises a question" of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The policy would affect tournaments on the PGA Tour and the Senior PGA Tour, as 
well as Ben Hogan tour events. 
</P>
<P>
The statement comes after more than a week of controversy concerning the 
national championship, which starts Thursday, and its site, the previously 
all-white Shoal Creek Country Club in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Bowing to pressure from civil rights groups and planned demonstrations, Shoal 
Creek awarded honorary membership to a black businessman this week and said it 
was considering another black for admission. 
</P>
<P>
"In the event a golf club indicates its membership practices and policies are 
non-discriminatory, but there is information that raises a question as to such 
practices and policies (e.g., all-white membership), the staff is authorized to 
require on a case-by-case basis that as a condition of hosting an event, the 
applicable golf club take appropriate action to encourage minority membership," 
the PGA statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Tournament Policy Board has instructed its staff that any agreement 
entered into between the PGA Tour and any local tournament co-sponsor shall 
specifically require that the practices and policies of any and all clubs 
proposed as tournament sites do not discriminate on the basis of race, 
religion, sex or national origin," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The tour staff also was empowered to terminate any agreements for breach of 
such representation. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said no contracts for a tournament will be extended "unless the 
PGA Tour is satisfied that its non-discriminatory policies are being enforced." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Shoal Creek racial controversy has centered on the PGA 
Championship, the tour does not have jurisdiction over that tournament or any 
of the three other major championships. 
</P>
<P>
The Masters is a private tournament run by the Augusta National Golf Club. The 
U.S. Open is run by the U.S. Golf Assn., the British Open by the Royal and 
Ancient golf club, and the PGA by the PGA of America. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the tour, the Shoal Creek controversy also forced the USGA and 
the Masters to reconsider their policies. 
</P>
<P>
The Tournament Policy Board determines the rules of the organization. The board 
is chaired by E. M. deWindt, and among its 10 members are four tour players -- 
John Mahaffey, Larry Mize, Pat McGowan and Mike Donald.

UNLV has filed an appeal seeking to overturn an NCAA ban that would prevent the 
Runnin' Rebels from defending their national basketball championship. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal was prepared over the last two weeks after the NCAA ruled July 20 
that the Rebels could not compete in postseason play next year. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty was an outgrowth of a case involving UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian and 
the NCAA dating back to 1977. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV appealed the penalty on the grounds it is a case of double jeopardy, since 
the university already served two years probation in the case, from 1977 to 
1979. The NCAA placed UNLV on probation for two years and ordered Tarkanian 
suspended for two years in 1977 for a series of violations. The university 
served the probation but Tarkanian obtained a court injunction preventing his 
suspension and continued coaching, compiling the best record, percentage-wise, 
among active college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, Big West Conference athletic directors, meeting in Los 
Angeles, delayed taking action that would prevent the Rebels from playing in 
the conference postseason basketball tournament next year. Conference officials 
say they want to await the outcome of UNLV's appeal before making a decision.

a second player in the package. 
</P>
<P>
Team officials have said the trade centered around sending Murphy to 
Philadelphia for relief pitcher Jeff Parrett. 
</P>
<P>
But the Atlanta Constitution said in today's editions that the Phillies have 
balked at the Braves' demand for another, unidentified player in the package. 
</P>
<P>
Braves General Manager Bobby Cox refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
As a 10-year veteran Murphy had the right to veto a trade, but he will not do 
so, his agent, Bruce Church, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Where it goes past here is up to Bobby," Church said. "I guess you could say 
we're waiting on him." 
</P>
<P>
If the Braves grant permission, the Phillies could begin contract talks with 
Murphy, whose pact expires at the end of this season.

THOMAS IN POSITION TO WREST LINEBACKER CROWN FROM TAYLOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Second Coming of Lawrence Taylor is an event that has been anticipated by 
NFL talent scouts since he took the league's quarterbacks by storm as a New 
York Giants rookie in 1981. Taylor's impact redefined the outside linebacker 
position. In subsequent drafts, one player after another has been fitted with 
the label of "The Next L. T." and found wanting -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
"The Next L. T." arrived last season in Kansas City where the Chiefs were 
simply hoping to end their 15-year search for the next Bobby Bell. The 
prodigy's initials are D. T., which stands for Derrick Thomas, and he has some 
experience with this heir-to-a-legend business since it was his job at the 
University of Alabama to become "The Next Cornelius Bennett." He did a heck of 
a job by obliterating all of Bennett's records for sacks, and he quickly 
established himself as L. T.'s likely successor with 10 sacks in his first 10 
NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
Although Thomas failed to record any more sacks and break the rookie record of 
12.5 by the Chargers' Leslie O'Neal, he did surpass the rookie totals of Taylor 
(9.5), Bennett (8.5) and Green Bay's Tim Harris (7.5). His presence also helped 
transform the Chiefs from 4-11-1 doormats in 1988 into 8-7-1 winners last year 
and legitimate contenders for the AFC title this season. 
</P>
<P>
During the second half of last season, Chiefs opponents were forced to devise 
ways to control Thomas, just as Giants foes first must try to stop L. T. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw teams create situations where a back never has to block Derrick," Coach 
Marty Schottenheimer said recently. "He enabled us to do things where, even 
though he didn't get the sacks, he created situations for other people to get 
sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Derrick's No. 1 physical quality is his speed. He needs to improve his run 
defense and to work to understand blocking schemes, but there are no physical 
limits from greatness." 
</P>
<P>
Towering self-confidence, enthusiasm for the game and a mean streak have been 
the trademarks of Taylor's play. Thomas shares those traits. And just as Taylor 
has wrestled with drug involvement in his past, Thomas had to overcome a period 
of juvenile delinquency in the poor south Miami neighborhood of Perrine before 
he could begin to properly channel his athletic talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little wild because of the crowd I chose to hang out with," Thomas 
recalled. "I never really got into serious trouble. We fought every day and 
stole bikes, things that could go unnoticed or could be emphasized." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas doesn't deny his youthful mistakes, but he doesn't dwell on them either 
because he recognized a dead end when he saw it and made a conscious effort to 
turn his life around. His father's death in Vietnam two weeks before Thomas' 
sixth birthday made life rough from the start. Air Force Capt. Robert Thomas 
and his B-52 crew were shot down Dec. 17, 1972, the first day of a massive 
bombing assault ironically called Operation Linebacker II. The entire crew 
survived except for Capt. Thomas, who was the last to evacuate before the plane 
exploded. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point in Thomas' life came when he was 15 and a counselor insisted, 
over his objections, on enrolling him in a program for youthful miscreants at 
Dade Marine Institute. Thomas said, "I knew I wanted to go to college, but I 
wasn't taking the necessary steps. It was hard to straddle both sides of the 
fence -- being bad at night and a scholar in the day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"DMI is a school that gives you self-confidence. You learn how to cope in 
society. You meet with a counselor every morning and then go to class. The 
amount of people is limited, so you get more help. We did things inner-city 
kids never have an opportunity to do, like driving boats and scuba diving. For 
the first time, I really wanted to focus on doing good instead of bad." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' new direction took him to Alabama where his first two seasons were 
spent playing in Bennett's shadow. "The biggest thing I learned is the level to 
compete at," Thomas said, referring to Bennett, a two-time Pro Bowl player with 
the Buffalo Bills. "He does it every play." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett recorded a school-record 10 sacks his senior year and won most every 
national honor possible. "After he graduated, people said there never would be 
another Cornelius Bennett," Thomas said. "I took that as a personal challenge. 
I said I would get 10 sacks by the midpoint of the year. I did that and 
finished the year with 18. My senior year, I set a goal to get 18 by the 
midpoint of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas finished his senior year with the mind-blowing total of 27 sacks, which 
pretty much made him the Babe Ruth of big-time college outside linebackers. "I 
worked hard to be the best, and the talk got smaller about Cornelius Bennett," 
said Thomas, who has grown close to Bennett and takes part in the same summer 
football camp. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he has reached the highest level of the game, Thomas is focusing on 
Taylor's achievements, including 114 sacks in nine seasons. "I think Lawrence 
Taylor is the standard by which you measure all outside linebackers," Thomas 
said. "He's accomplished everything you can, and Lawrence Taylor has done it in 
remarkable fashion. He's missed what? One game in nine years?" 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has watched and listened to the highlight films of Taylor at play, and 
he admits to mimicking L. T.'s competitive demeanor. "I have a real attitude," 
said Thomas, whose disposition off the field is notably sunny. 
</P>
<P>
"I accomplished some things last year on pure athletic ability," Thomas said. 
"This year I'm becoming more familiar with the system and adding the element of 
knowledge. Put those factors together, and this year should be better."

MORGAN, PALMER: PARALLEL PATHS TO HALL OF FAME; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: TWO VETERAN PLAYERS TO BE INDUCTED SUNDAY. THEY REMAIN CLOSE TO THE 
GAME AND ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME MODERN TRENDS.

<P>
The last time Joe Morgan faced Jim Palmer in an American League game, he swung 
at and missed a 3-0 pitch before drawing a walk. He was embarrassed enough by 
that swing to seek out Palmer the next day to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday the two men will stand side by side at Cooperstown to join Baseball's 
Hall of Fame, marking the final high point in careers that were parallel, but 
infrequently intertwined. Morgan hit an All-Star Game homer off Palmer and 
faced the Baltimore Oriole pitcher on other occasions, but he recalled that 
last at-bat most vividly during a telephone conference call. 
</P>
<P>
"That last at-bat was against a guy who was struggling, but I swung at a 3-0 
pitch because I thought maybe I could get a hit," said Morgan, a second baseman 
on Cincinnati's Big Red Machine in the 1970s. "I was struggling, too, but it 
was the kind of thing I never would have done five years before. You don't kick 
a guy when he's down. When I did that, I decided it was time for me to quit." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer recalled the night and the apology, too, admitting that it helped him 
realize that the end was near, as well. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday both men will be honored for their ringing achievements in 
careers that saw both set standards of excellence at their positions. 
Broadcaster Byrum Saam and writer Jerome Holtzman also will be inducted. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing about being elected to the Hall of Fame," Palmer 
said, "is that the players there set goals for others to shoot at. Joe Morgan 
set standards for infielders. Players know if they can do what he did they have 
a chance to be in the Hall of Fame. When I was pitching, I looked at the Sandy 
Koufaxes, Don Drysdales, Early Wynns and Robin Robertses. They set the goals 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan says that he "wonders if I belong in there with Ty Cobb, Henry Aaron, 
Willie Mays and all the other great ballplayers" and that he considers the 
ceremony "a very special weekend." 
</P>
<P>
"I was fortunate to grow up in the East Bay and see the Oakland Oaks of the 
Pacific Coast League as a young boy. My father taught me the game from the 
stands. In high school, the Giants came to San Francisco and I could see Mays, 
whom I still consider the greatest player there ever was. Seeing players like 
that fueled me to try to be a major leaguer." 
</P>
<P>
Both men are now broadcasters. Morgan works San Francisco games and is part of 
the ESPN Sunday night crew. Palmer announces in Baltimore and works ESPN Friday 
night games. Both also have worked network games. So each remains close to 
baseball and some of the game's current problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned that statistics are becoming overly important in evaluating a 
player's worth to his ballclub," Morgan said of the modern game. "What a player 
does to help his team win should be more important. A player may beat out a 
bunt with a runner on second base and two outs; that shows as a base hit, but 
it isn't helping the club win." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer is concerned about the number of young players rushed to the top level 
because of a thinning of talent. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are spending as little as a year to 18 months in the minors," he said. 
"They don't get fundamentally sound as a result. In fact, some of them don't 
even know what they have to do to get better. I was fortunate to be on a team 
with a great blend of veterans who could help teach."

MODASPORT STICKS TO BASIC BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her name is Georgiana Ivan-Treivush. Her kingdom is Modasport, a collection of 
five sleek, airy stores that cater to female executives and members of the 
brunch bunch. For 10 years -- from the day Ivan-Treivush opened her first store 
in the Beverly Glen Centre to this April when she opened her latest in San 
Francisco -- she has guarded her privacy, believing "the less people know, the 
better." 
</P>
<P>
To some, extent her accomplishments speak for themselves. She is considered the 
master builder of a distinctly California approach to dressing. The Modasport 
"look" is a mix of spare, modern suiting pieces combined with more decorative 
ones. It reeks of money (summer prices range from $26 for a T-shirt to $4,000 
for a beaded linen jacket) without screaming any famous designer's name. It is 
eclectic rather than funky, often embellished but never ornate. And it is a 
formula that Ivan-Treivush predicts will bring in $12 million in retail sales 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the quiet start -- one small shop on Beverly Glen near Mulholland Drive 
-- people from California to Cannes now know Modasport (a word Ivan-Treivush 
coined to reflect a casual approach to fashion) and its credo: "Trends without 
being trendy from designers who are not overexposed," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She has always carried California designers among her lesser-known labels, 
especially the more feminine and romantic -- Bonnie Strauss, Antony Moorcroft 
and Katayone Adeli for Laundry. But she leans more heavily on European 
designers, particularly Claude Barthelemy of France, whose fitted, soft-edged 
jackets, skirts and pants are considered classics-with-a-twist, or "basics to 
build on," as Ivan-Treivush calls them. And there are always items to be mixed 
and matched with "Claude" from an ever-changing group of high-spirited 
international designers. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry insiders say Ivan-Treivush's achievements have little to do with 
her taste, timing or drive and much to do with her husband's money. She is 
married to Menachem Treivush, owner of the BB1 sportswear stores and several 
apparel companies, including Ton Sur Ton and Bonnie Strauss. 
</P>
<P>
But Ivan-Treivush points out that she met Treivush after the success of her 
Beverly Glen store and during the planning stages of her second one, on 
Brighton Way in Beverly Hills. And, she insists, "he has invested nothing in my 
business." 
</P>
<P>
There is also talk that she is hard as nails. The designation comes, in part, 
from her long-standing demand that designers supply her with exclusive 
merchandise. She does not expect to see anything she orders in nearby stores, 
including neighboring retailers in her three other locations: Brentwood 
Gardens, Fashion Island and the San Francisco Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is afraid of her," one designer says. "If you want to do business 
with her, you have to cater to her, dance around her." Asked why anyone deals 
with Modasport's mastermind, the response is quick: "She gives huge orders, 
bigger than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
If she has critics, she also has admirers. They say the tall, blond 
entrepreneur (born Georgiana Ivanisevic in Zagreb, Yugoslavia; raised in Shaker 
Heights, Ohio) is a self-made woman blessed with brains, business acumen, an 
enviable sense of style and a tremendous instinct for knowing how to satisfy 
her fashion-hungry clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Jumping to Ivan-Treivush's defense, Katayone Adeli says: "I always felt she was 
one of the best buyers I've ever seen, because she really knows her customer." 
</P>
<P>
As for Bonnie Strauss, when she was in financial trouble two years ago, 
Ivan-Treivush recommended she contact Treivush, who became Strauss' backer. "So 
you understand why I say she is my favorite buyer in many respects," Strauss 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan-Treivush agrees she is tough, "if that means I have certain rules and 
guidelines I stick with. If I give a designer an order, I'm giving him a 
commitment. And I expect that commitment to be filled: prompt delivery, proper 
fit, no dialogue, no problems." 
</P>
<P>
Her intensely competitive spirit has been part of the package since she started 
her business, alone, with $25,000 inherited from her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
"This has all evolved from that money," she says. She has "no partners, no 
backers, no publicist." Her only forms of advertising are word of mouth, 
occasional ads in L.A. Style magazine and two to four fashion shows a year (at 
a cost of about $10,000 each) for carefully selected charity events. 
</P>
<P>
She traces her business savvy to her grandfather, "an entrepreneur in 
Yugoslavia before the communists took over." Fashion inspiration came from her 
mother, a former model, and from jobs she held as a teen-ager. She worked for a 
retailer ("he put me through a great schooling") and as a personal-improvement 
instructor at the Barbizon school of modeling. (Her "strict European 
background" qualified her for that job, she says.) 
</P>
<P>
Retail wasn't her first career. When a friend interviewed for a summer job with 
Northwest Airlines in Cleveland, Ivan-Treivush went along and landed the 
position instead. She stayed on with the airline's reservations department and 
came to California in 1972 as "the youngest supervisor in the industry. I was 
21." 
</P>
<P>
With the windfall from her grandmother, she decided to do "something more 
creative." She owned a home near the Glen Centre and opened her boutique "in 
the middle of nowhere, because Beverly Hills and all the other places seemed 
very frightening." Inspired by an Italian club called Jacki'o, she dubbed her 
store Bibi'o and filled it with unusual European merchandise. A year later, she 
rented additional space and named the store Modasport. 
</P>
<P>
Menachem Treivush says he tried to discourage her from leasing the 
1,000-square-foot location on Brighton Way (enlarged now to 2,500 square feet). 
"It was the beginning of the '80s, and we were just coming out of a major 
recession in the United States," he recalls. "I thought she needed a lot of 
guts to jump in the sea with the big sharks who were controlling the area at 
the time. But she showed me she could really run with the best of them." 
</P>
<P>
The couple, married for four years, own an apartment in New York, a home in Los 
Angeles and "a small estate" in Montecito. In lieu of children, "there are 
eight dogs," Ivan-Treivush says with a big grin. "Right now, my shops are my 
children." 
</P>
<P>
She tends them from a bright, luxurious upstairs office she converted from a 
drab three-bedroom apartment. Downstairs, at the corner of N. La Peer Drive and 
Santa Monica Boulevard, is City Warehouse, a clearance center she established 
to protect her customers: "I'm always afraid to sell something I have left over 
to a jobber, who might sell it to someone down the street from me." 
</P>
<P>
Her setbacks seem few, but in May, when her five-year lease expired, she closed 
Modasport Encore in the Beverly Hills Rodeo Collection. She says she decided to 
incorporate the dressy evening clothes into her expanded Brighton Way store. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Mahboubi, in charge of leasing and promotion for the Rodeo Collection 
(and owner of the Gianni Versace boutique there), says, "I never understood the 
concept of the store. I'm not saying it was good or bad. It just never looked 
the same as her other Modasport stores." 
</P>
<P>
Mahboubi gives her friend and former tenant high marks: "She's smart, she's 
fun. But I can see how she can come across hard. This is a tough business, and 
it's dominated by men. You have to be hard, you have to stand your ground. 
There were women with far more money at their fingertips who couldn't do what 
Georgiana did. She's an innovator. Her concept is still fresh. Everything 
matches everything else. It works visually when you start to put on the 
clothes. That's what good merchandising is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Disenchanted shoppers and some industry observers complain the merchandise is 
boring and overpriced, and that the "sales stylists" (well-groomed, 
well-dressed women who work on commission) are overbearing and intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
But the faithful can't get enough. In a typical Modasport scenario, Carole 
Sherman, a Beverly Hills real estate broker and wife of entertainment manager 
Richard Sherman, recalls she walked by the Brighton Way store "and fell in love 
with the window displays. They're incredible." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt she has become a preferred customer. Sherman says over the past two 
years, she has frequently whizzed in, selected clothes without trying them on 
and dropped "a few thousand dollars" in as little as 45 minutes.

LABOR, DRUG ISSUES STILL PLAGUE TAGLIABUE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, when the NFL's club owners met to select a commissioner to succeed 
Pete Rozelle, Paul Tagliabue suffered the worst defeat of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Although most owners had known him for his 20 years as the league's lawyer, no 
one voted for Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
Not until last October, when the campaign for New Orleans General Manager Jim 
Finks collapsed, was Tagliabue elected -- and even then, not unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the NFL begins another year of exhibitions, international appearances, 
regular-season games and playoffs -- in his first full season as commissioner 
-- has he recovered from the humiliation of learning that he was everyone's 
second choice? 
</P>
<P>
Those who know him at work in New York and at home in Washington swear that 
Tagliabue has nothing to recover from, because he never felt humiliated. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, he hadn't even seemed interested in becoming commissioner. In the 
midst of the league's long selection process last summer, while angry owners 
were shouting at one another during a series of fruitless meetings, Tagliabue 
and his wife took off for Europe on a six-week vacation. 
</P>
<P>
But he came back wanting the job, and, three months later, swept smoothly into 
Rozelle's office on Park Avenue. And as the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks 
prepare for Saturday's exhibition game in Tokyo, the first of four 
international exhibitions this month, it is clear that Tagliabue is pro 
football's man in charge. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't solved two problems -- the labor and drug issues remain -- but in all 
other areas, Tagliabue, 49, has shown the steadiness and self-assurance of a 
veteran commissioner with a grasp of the NFL's complex issues. 
</P>
<P>
As John Shaw, Ram vice president, said: "Paul has far exceeded the expectations 
we had for him at this point in his career." 
</P>
<P>
Able executives don't always start fast. More often than not, they look around 
and listen awhile before leaping. Thus, Tagliabue, a tall, spare, 49-year-old 
former basketball player, has more to show for his first 10 months in New York 
than most other commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't responsible for all the gains, true. But he was the NFL's leader when 
the league: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Signed a record $3.6-billion TV contract. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to limit instant-replay reviews to a maximum of two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to shorten halftimes and make other changes designed to shorten most 
games to three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Planned to add two franchises in 1993, when the NFL could have three 
10-team conferences, with five teams in each of six divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Began a series of meetings bringing together, for the first time, game 
officials and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Initiated advisory meetings with former players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Widened the NFL's war on recreational drug use after the resignation of Dr. 
Forest Tennant, who was replaced by two doctors and a counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Attacked the steroid problem with a new, random-testing program that will 
bar players testing positive for the muscle-building drug for at least four 
games. On appeal, players testing positive may observe retests. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Extended the regular season from 16 to 17 weeks this year with a series of 
byes, giving the teams of each division the same day off. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Broadened the playoff season. The playoffs will start next January with a 
two-day, eight-team, four-game first round involving six wild-card teams and 
two division champions. That will replace the one-day wild-card first round, 
during which only two games were played. 
</P>
<P>
"The addition of two wild cards this year gives us a chance for a much more 
exciting (first round)," Tagliabue said. "And it will be fairer to the good 
teams that happen to be in the same division with even better teams. In recent 
years, Denver, Washington and others have just missed with 10-6 records that 
were better than the records of some (teams) in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
On Tagliabue's first-year report card, among the "A" grades, are an "F" in 
labor and an incomplete in drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In those areas, Tagliabue isn't wholly or even mainly responsible. But much as 
coaches, quarterbacks and commissioners are credited for all victories, they 
are blamed for any defeats. 
</P>
<P>
"Labor (peace) is my No. 1 priority," Tagliabue said the other day. "Whatever 
is second is a distant second." 
</P>
<P>
He has said much the same for 10 months, and he has worked hard on it. Still, 
there is no peace, no end to the fuss that has kept the NFL's players and 
owners without a collective bargaining agreement for three years. 
</P>
<P>
The impasse suggests that the league's constitution and bylaws render a 
commissioner almost powerless when opposed by blocs of resolute owners or 
players. The two-edged problem: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A majority of NFL players have declared for limited free agency. Their 
stand isn't negotiable, they insist, noting that NFL careers average only four 
years. Their view is that it is reasonable to seek free agency -- not for all 
players -- but for all who, beating the averages, last at least four years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The NFL's most conservative eight or 10 owners, led by Hugh Culverhouse of 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, have reportedly vowed never to give in on free 
agency. And because the NFL is a league in which the minority can rule, the 
votes of eight of the 28 owners can block progress in any field. 
</P>
<P>
Result: No results. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue seems more sure-footed when it comes to battling drugs, although it's 
doubtful that any executive today deserves more than an incomplete grade. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue inherited a controversial drug adviser, Tennant, whose program had 
been criticized both by the NFL Players Assn. and by various media elements. 
</P>
<P>
As Tennant completed his fourth year on the job last February, he sent in his 
resignation only four months after Tagliabue's election. It was instantly 
accepted. Tagliabue's reasoning: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although hired as an adviser, Tennant wanted to be the NFL's drug 
spokesman, too, and his shooting from the hip in public appearances got him in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Differing with the NFLPA and some reporters, the NFL found that Tennant was 
satisfactorily handling his duties. 
</P>
<P>
"The charges against him (by players and media) were unfair," Tagliabue said. 
"He did a fine job, and had a good program. The problem was his unnecessary 
(visibility)." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL calls Tennant a competent scientist who, unlike some scientists, enjoys 
performing on television, where he isn't competent. The TV camera makes him 
look immature, evasive and uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tennant harmed both himself and the league several times, the NFL 
alleges, with his offhand televised remarks on the inadequacy of drug 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about that, Tennant said he is convinced -- along with others in his 
field -- that counseling is ineffective for addicts who, because of cocaine 
use, have suffered the loss of pain-relieving endorphins in their brains. 
</P>
<P>
But even after hearing Tennant's explanation, Tagliabue, at his Super Bowl news 
conference last winter, said he was "mystified" by his drug adviser's attitude 
toward counseling. 
</P>
<P>
That day, an NFL source said: "My hunch is that Tennant is right about drug 
counseling. But advisers who mystify the boss are usually out of there." 
</P>
<P>
At 9:15 p.m. on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend two months ago, the 
telephone rang in the New York residence of Joe Browne, the NFL's vice 
president for communications and development. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue was calling from the Washington beltway on the new telephone in his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner was on his way home to Bethesda, Md., from his old law office 
in Washington, where, as usual, he had spent Sunday thinking about and working 
on NFL problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been trying to reach him at home that evening," Browne said. "I should 
have known better than to call him there." 
</P>
<P>
To Tagliabue, fun time is work time, so the new phone gives him the best of two 
worlds. Since taking office last fall, he has found that the only real change 
in his lifestyle is a longer workday on Washington weekends as he drives along, 
telephoning Browne and other business associates. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue's distinguishing characteristics are still a capacity for work and a 
compulsion to be well informed. 
</P>
<P>
In 20 years as an NFL lawyer, he was seldom surprised by any opponent, judge or 
jury. And as a commissioner, he has already become the NFL's authority on 
nearly everything. 
</P>
<P>
That makes him more admired than loved. It isn't easy to love a boss who works 
12 hours a day, Sundays included. Even so, Tagliabue holds the respect of the 
league for his role in setting a fast new pace at the NFL office. 
</P>
<P>
There, for example, the work week now begins at 8:30 a.m. Monday with a meeting 
of Tagliabue and the league's senior department heads. 
</P>
<P>
Those executives, who are now obliged to spend the weekend thinking instead of 
playing, were all hired during the Rozelle era. There have been no shake-ups so 
far, and only a few staff changes. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant has been replaced by Minneapolis drug counselor Peter Bell and two 
doctors, Lawrence S. Brown of New York and John Lombardo of Ohio. Browne has 
been promoted to head planner -- for expansion, realignment and the like -- in 
addition to head publicist. Greg Aiello, formerly of the Dallas Cowboys, has 
succeeded Browne as director of communications, with Jim Heffernan remaining as 
director of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Tagliabue has settled in as a man of two cities. Throughout the 
off-season, he has commonly taken the 6 p.m. train to Washington Fridays and 
the 6 p.m. train back Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Tagliabue's wife, Chandler, whom he calls Chan, has spent most of 
her time in Washington, where their daughter, Emily, finished high school. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, Emily will be at Yale, son Drew at Amherst and Chan in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to Sundays with Paul at football games," she said. "Most 
of our traveling now is job-related." 
</P>
<P>
They even saw a soccer game this summer, the World Cup final, when Tagliabue 
was overseas on international football business. Their game-day companion was 
Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state who was serving as a Times 
soccer critic. 
</P>
<P>
("World-class soccer) players are great athletes, and it was an extraordinary 
spectacle," Tagliabue said. "But the game itself was like a 3-0 Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the Tagliabues have taken a temporary apartment a block from his 
Manhattan office. He can see it across the way. 
</P>
<P>
"The (one-bedroom) apartment is a bit small, but centrally located," said Chan 
Tagliabue, who hopes to resume a part-time career as a social activist. 
</P>
<P>
She has worked in other years for Planned Parenthood and as a fund-raiser for 
the family's Episcopal church. But as the wife of a busy commissioner, she 
hasn't set any 1990s priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband has. Having dealt with most NFL problems, his priority now is to 
eliminate the labor unrest and drug turmoil. Either might be enough to make 
even a workaholic cringe.

SADDAM HUSSEIN: 'REALISTIC,' 'UTTERLY RUTHLESS';

<P>
Saddam Hussein's dream is to be another Gamal Abdel Nasser, though the 
architect of the newest crisis in the Middle East has little of the personal 
magnetism that made the Egyptian strongman of the 1950s and 1960s the kingpin 
of the splintered Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein is 53, a little jowly, more than amply filling his Western business 
suits and his military uniforms. He is devoid of the personal charisma that 
helped his hero build a fanatical following of millions. He has none of the 
theatrical flare of Libya's Moammar Kadafi. Westerners who see him face to face 
-- as did four U.S. senators earlier this year -- usually go away knowing no 
more about him than they did before. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, his efforts to develop nuclear weapons, his use of poison gas against 
the Kurdish minority and Iran and his bombastic threats have at times 
encouraged an image of irrationality. 
</P>
<P>
But experts characterize Hussein as a skilled tactician and astute politician. 
"He is realistic, reasonable and utterly ruthless," said James R. Schlesinger, 
a former secretary of defense and former director of central intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
"Chancellor Bismarck said 'the future of history will not be decided by the 
votes of parliaments, but by blood and iron,' and Hussein is a practitioner of 
that," Schlesinger said. "The only thing surprising about what he did (in 
Kuwait) is that people are surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein has made himself a power beyond Iraq and forced his dream of Arab 
leadership to be taken seriously for two reasons: His barren country sits on 
the world's richest oil deposits outside of Saudi Arabia, and he commands a 
million-member army equipped with high-tech Western armaments -- including 
deadly chemical weapons and the missiles to deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
His military forces -- victorious in an eight-year war with Iran -- and his 
ruthless willingness to use them have significantly changed the power balance 
in the Middle East. Other Arab leaders were nervous even before Hussein picked 
his fight with Kuwait over oil prices, and Hussein's power has lent credence to 
his casting himself as Nasser's successor. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Arab world -- among admirers and opponents alike -- he is known 
simply as Saddam. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he is a man of monumental ego -- fired by a hatred of Israel and the 
West -- who dominates his nation's television airwaves and papers his capital 
with his picture in a variety of garbs to suit all tastes. 
</P>
<P>
He is surrounded by layer upon layer of security police, many of them with 
common roots back in his home village of Tikrit. They have helped create an 
apparatus that insured against the development of any meaningful political 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein left his home village as a boy, and is said to have committed his first 
murder when he was 14 and attempted his first political assassination when he 
was 22. He was trained as a lawyer at the University of Cairo and the 
University of Baghdad, while also becoming a student of revolutionary politics. 
He became and continues to be a voracious reader of biographies of the world's 
great leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Now ensconced as "president for life" at the head of a relatively modern 
secular state, Hussein so far has succeeded through brutal oppression of his 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
He has wasted little energy cultivating allies, instead feuding with Syria, 
carrying on the brutal war with Iran and turning against erstwhile friends such 
as Kuwait, who supported him in that war. 
</P>
<P>
By one account, he has circulated around the Middle East a videotape of a 1979 
trial for 21 members of his Baath Party, whom he suspected of collusion with 
Syria. He is shown sitting before a crowd of 1,000 party members and officials, 
demanding that the rumored traitors stand and identify themselves. 
</P>
<P>
As he casually smokes a cigar and waits, the 21 surrender to security men one 
by one -- and were said to have been subsequently executed. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years since an Israeli air strike wiped out an Iraqi nuclear reactor 
under construction, Hussein has adamantly denied that he is trying to acquire a 
nuclear capability to go with his chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But evidently fearing that Israel might make another preemptive strike against 
his imposing military machine, he threatened earlier this year to destroy half 
of Israel in response to any such attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I swear to God that if Israel dares to hit even one piece of steel on any 
industrial site, we will make the fire eat half of Israel," he declared in a 
radio broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
The rhetoric, more than calculated actions, has spawned the image of a wild man 
in doubtful control. 
</P>
<P>
But the truth, say Western diplomats in Baghdad, is that Hussein is a wily 
master of Arab politics, who swings from empty exaggerated rhetoric to 
understated threats that often carry far more significance. 
</P>
<P>
Had the West listened closely enough, Schlesinger said Thursday, it could have 
heard warnings two weeks ago of what was to happen in Kuwait.

HIGH COURT NOMINATION DRAWS MIXED REACTION; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: SOME CRITICS SAY DEUKMEJIAN'S SELECTION OF A FORMER AIDE, APPELLATE 
JUSTICE MARVIN BAXTER, RAISES SPECTER OF CRONYISM. 
</P>

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's nomination of Appellate Justice Marvin R. Baxter, his 
former aide, to the state Supreme Court is drawing mixed reaction -- with some 
critics expressing dismay over the specter of "cronyism" on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is little chance Baxter will be denied confirmation, the 
governor's selection of a jurist with less than two years on the bench is 
disturbing some lawyers, academics and political activists. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter's nomination will go before the state Judicial Appointments Commission 
on Aug. 27 and, if approved, will be on the fall ballot. If confirmed, the 
50-year-old Fresno jurist would succeed Justice David N. Eagleson, who is 
retiring in January. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member high court then would include three jurists with close 
personal ties to Deukmejian -- Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, his former law 
partner; Justice Armand Arabian, an early political supporter and longtime 
friend, and Baxter, the governor's former appointments secretary and, like 
Arabian, also of Armenian heritage. 
</P>
<P>
The governor and other supporters can point to Baxter's unblemished 23-year 
career in law and public service and the broad support -- including 
endorsements from two state Supreme Court justices -- when Deukmejian named him 
to the state Court of Appeal in the fall of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he is very able and hard-working and will be an excellent addition to 
the court," said Marjorie L. Carter, president of the California Women Lawyers 
and recent appointee to the Orange County Municipal Court. "It's to be expected 
that a governor will pick people he knows well. That's just a fact of political 
life." 
</P>
<P>
But critics note that Deukmejian's seven previous high-court appointees 
generally had spent much more time on the bench -- although one, Justice Joyce 
L. Kennard, had only been a judge for three years. And some wonder if the 
Republican governor -- who led the successful attack against former Chief 
Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other liberal jurists in the fall 1986 
election -- has gone overboard in remaking the court in his own image. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter's nomination "smacks a little bit of cronyism," said UC Berkeley law 
professor Preble Stolz, a close observer and author of a book on the high 
court. "This was not an inspired appointment." 
</P>
<P>
John C. Gamboa, executive director of the Latino Issues Forum, pointed to the 
absence of a Latino justice on the court after the defeat of Justice Cruz 
Reynoso in 1986 and the retirement of Deukmejian-appointee John A. Arguelles 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed and angry," Gamboa said. "Cronyism seems to be muscling 
out any chance for minorities to get on the court. We now have two Armenians 
for a small Armenian population -- but zero Hispanics for 25% of the state." 
</P>
<P>
Patience Milrod, one of a group of Fresno women lawyers who opposed Baxter's 
nomination to the Court of Appeal, also faults the nomination. "The governor is 
providing for his friends and associates before he departs," said Milrod. "It's 
kind of demoralizing for people to be put on the court, not because of their 
integrity and knowledge, but because they were good servants to the politicians 
in charge." 
</P>
<P>
Even some supporters acknowledge uneasiness with the nomination. Michael 
Rushford, president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a public-interest 
firm supporting law enforcement, says the governor has every right to appoint 
someone he knows and trusts and calls Baxter a "good, solid" selection. 
</P>
<P>
"But when you put on too many people with political experience -- rather than 
those who are grounded in legal scholarship -- you tend to see more political 
decisions," Rushford said. 
</P>
<P>
UC Davis law professor John B. Oakley, without criticizing Baxter or the 
nomination, believes the governor would not have risked offering an aide with 
relatively little judicial experience had the nomination been subject to 
legislative approval, as under the federal system. 
</P>
<P>
The requirement of legislative review forces a chief executive to choose a 
nominee from a broader circle of candidates, Oakley said. "It's healthy for a 
(people) governed by a constitution and judges with the power of judicial 
review to have a court that is representative in a very broad sense." 
</P>
<P>
While judicial experience is valued, Stolz and other legal experts point out 
that it is by no means a prerequisite to success on a higher court. Two of 
California's most esteemed chief justices -- Phil S. Gibson and Roger J. 
Traynor -- went directly to the state high court without previous service on 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
John H. Findley, litigation director of the Pacific Legal Foundation, believes 
Baxter, as a newcomer to the judiciary, could bring some welcome diversity to 
the high court. "It might be a good idea to have someone with a different 
viewpoint -- someone who is not a professional jurist, as such," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Court observers agree Baxter's service in the Deukmejian Administration 
provided a unique opportunity to examine and compare the records of a wide 
variety of judicial aspirants. As appointments secretary, he served as a sort 
of "judge of judges," assisting the governor in the selection of more than 600 
judges from 1983 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
When Deukmejian named Baxter to the appeal court, opposition arose from some 
members of the Fresno County Women Lawyers group over the Administration's 
failure to appoint any women to local judicial posts. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, at the time, 103 of the 650 administration judgeships had gone to 
women -- a percentage about the same as under Democratic Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) 
Brown. And, according to the Administration, the percentage of women applicants 
who were appointed was about the same as the rate for male applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The state Judicial Appointments Commission, made up of Lucas, state Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp and Presiding Justice Donald R. Franson of the Court of 
Appeal in Fresno, unanimously approved Baxter's nomination in the wake of broad 
support from the state's legal community. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter's nomination was endorsed by Supreme Court Justices Arguelles and Edward 
A. Panelli and a host of appeals court justices, including Lester W. Roth, who 
as the state's senior presiding justice will sit on the appointments commission 
when it reviews Baxter's nomination to the state high court. 
</P>
<P>
Other backers included Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, Janice 
Kamenir-Reznik of the California Women Lawyers, Monica M. Jimenez of the 
Mexican-American Bar Assn. and Irwin S. Evans of the California Assn. of Black 
Lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Cruz County Dist. Atty. Arthur Danner, then president of the California 
District Attorneys Assn., supported Baxter's nomination to the appeals court 
and now backs him for the high-court post as well. 
</P>
<P>
"He's well-respected and even-handed," Danner said. "While he has not been on 
the appeal court a very long time, previous to that (as appointments secretary) 
he had been in the position where he had to make the same kind of judgments and 
evaluations that a judge makes. That can prove important experience as well."
